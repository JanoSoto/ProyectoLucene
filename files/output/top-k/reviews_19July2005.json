One of the most famous examples is Sydney Pollack's 1973 film The Way We Were. Set from the 1930's through the 1950's, Barbra Streisand plays Katie, an outspoken member of the Communist party and campus activist who does not have anything handed to her; she works two and sometimes three jobs in order to pay for her living and college tuition. Hubble (Redford) is your typical aforementioned golden boy, a big man on campus who indulges in sports, debutantes and all-around good times. The two know each other from the diner Katie works at (he being the patron) and at one point before graduation, briefly bond over their shared passion for writing. Cut to a few years in the future and Katie encounters Hubble at a bar. Hubble is in the armed forces and Katie is characteristically working a couple of jobs while volunteering for various social causes. After a night of drunken sex (Hubble being the drunken one) they embark on an unlikely relationship that spans over a decade and includes a move to California (when Hubble becomes a screenwriter in Hollywood) and the conception of one child. They are happy, but realize that regardless of their desire, they can't completely cross social lines and certainly can't change one another, particularly Katie's ever-ferocious dedication to social causes; a fight that becomes exponentially heated during McCarthy's Red Scare. The two have to decide whether they can sustain enough raw emotion for one another to persevere over everything else that is stacked up against them.There are several things about The Way We Were that require suspension of disbelief (the fact that despite never having had much contact with one another that after one night of drunken lust and an awkward morning after being enough to kick start a relationship the magnitude of theirs is the first thing that comes to mind) but the bottom line is that it really is a well-written, well-directed and well-acted film. The two principal characters are full and complex, regardless of whether we are talking about the socially conscience Katie or the socially acceptable Hubble. I suspect they somewhat were written with the intent of familiarity for the purpose of effectiveness, and if this is true, it worked on me. The era in which these two characters were set was a very interesting time in American history, and the characters' actions during these times created some compelling cinema, particularly when it touched on the Red Scare.But who am I fooling? The main reason people watch this movie, whether for the first time or for the fiftieth is for the doomed romance, and Streisand and Redford deliver in spades. The Way We Were was written for Streisand, (something that cause Redford to turn down the part at first, because he knew the film was going to be hers) and her portrayal of Katie is excellent. There are so many perceptions of Streisand nowadays (some of them correct, to be sure) that it's easy to forget that she really does have some serious acting chops, and she exhibits them to full effect here. I also happened to learn that the soft filtered lens thing with her didn't just start with her later movies, for whatever reason she was filmed with that lens more often than not here, but that didn't do anything more than slightly distract me because I couldn't help but chuckle. Redford gives a typical solid performance as well, though his initial doubts about taking the role turned out to be valid; he is not the dynamic figure in the film. However, his character is a strong one and Redford does a good job.I don't know if Pollack knew he was creating a screen classic when he directed The Way We Were but he did make a very good film.

Not that you should really care.Okay, so I am a bit biased as a Batman fan, but speaking for Batman fans in general, I must say it is impossible to be a true Batman fan and enjoy this atrocity. Tim Burton himself has said that he would never read a comic book, which, right there, explains the extraordinary lack of respect o the source material that this film contains. Anything that disrespects the source material that it is based on, especially something as grand and wonderful as the Batman mythos, this much should be shamed.Let's start with the basic formula. This is a superhero movie. It is based off the comic book. So why, instead of having the main love interest from the comics, Catwoman, which offers an insightful look at the psyche of the Bat, and shows a great psychological story, have some dumb bimbo, played to the Nth degree of ANNOYING by Kim Basinger, be the love interest? Honestly, she spends all her on screen time screaming and whining, it is impossible to see why Batman would be attracted to her, especially considering that he is BATMAN! He is dark figure with a Really messed up psyche, making him impossible to connect to, and really isn't one for love interests. that is why Catwoman is the great love interest that she is. She shares his dark psyche, and they are truly soul mates. But apparently Hollywood just wanted to go with the hot bimbo storyline, that completely contradicts who the character in the movie is in the first place, than give a great, insightful look at what makes Batman Batman.Okay, that's actually not even my fifth biggest complaint. If you want my biggest complaint, it's Michael Keaton. Okay, we all know what Batman looks like. He's a man who has trained his body to physical perfection over decades, and is a master of every fighting style known to man, so he knows how to fight his way through fifty men. What do we get her? Scrawny, curly-haired Michael Keaton shoved in a giant rubber body suit in which he can't move, so he just throws a little punch her, maybe a kick here...Geez Louise! Now, if you were to say to pretty much anyone that Jack Nicholson is not a great actor, you would probably be shunned from existence. But for a character like the Joker, Nicholson is all wrong. I mean, Tom Hanks is a great actor, but you wouldn't cast him as Superman, would you? The Joker is supposed to be a lean, long-faced, high-pitched voice, squealing madman who is completely incoherent, and does enjoys just laughing and killing people. Nicholson just does it all wrong, but it's not really his fault at all. He's just completely miscast. Look, I don't know how to explain it all really, but if you're interested in what the Joker, and Batman for that matter, really should be, watch the internet short-film Batman Dead End. Then you'll see what I'm talking about, and how absurdly different form Nicholson's performance it is.No, on second thought, and I'm so raving mad at even talking about this film that this is how incoherent I am, my biggest complaint would be how Batman ruthlessly and systematically slaughters criminals, even to the point where it's trying to be humorous with it. Btman is a dealer of justice, not of murder. He would never kill unless he had absolutely no other choice. But like I said, this movie has no respect for the source material, or, for that matter, even the character that they're portraying. I guess they just wanted a big boom-bang action movie. There is a scene in the movie where Batman stops his car, lays out, everything stops, he lays out a bomb, the bomb blow up, and he speeds away. I guess that's supposed to be funny, but to me it's just sickening. It's a Smithsonian on just how completely disrespectful this film is to everything it's supposed to portray.And what's up with the comically fat Gordon? He's useless. That's why Batman has to do all the work! He's supposed to be an action hero kind of good, tough cop. Oh well.Finally, this film is so lazily written that it just glosses over moments in it that make absolutely NO sense. Like how Batman's rope magically wraps around a gargoyle to KILL the Joker, which is pretty darn bad in the first place. This isn't a small continuity blooper that you MIGHT notice, it's more like WOW! When did that happen! Also, I guess it's supposed to be exiting when the Joker manages to shot down Batman's plane with his big gun, but dude, it makes NO sense. And all of a sudden, a dangerous fugitive who has just poisoned the whole city, offers a bunch of cash, and the whole city of Gotham just figures he's a nice guy, and flocks to him, without even so much as the police int he way of this huge parade that he just magically managed to whip up. This film is lazily written to be a big bang-boom action film, without any respect to the source material, or, for that matter, the characters that it, by itself, is trying to portray.Ultimately, I give this film the dignity of 2\/10 because of a few enjoyable moments, but seriously, you could find better ways to waste your brain away.I'm out.

Look, I don't know how to explain it all really, but if you're interested in what the Joker, and Batman for that matter, really should be, watch the internet short-film Batman Dead End. Then you'll see what I'm talking about, and how absurdly different form Nicholson's performance it is.No, on second thought, and I'm so raving mad at even talking about this film that this is how incoherent I am, my biggest complaint would be how Batman ruthlessly and systematically slaughters criminals, even to the point where it's trying to be humorous with it. Btman is a dealer of justice, not of murder. He would never kill unless he had absolutely no other choice. But like I said, this movie has no respect for the source material, or, for that matter, even the character that they're portraying. I guess they just wanted a big boom-bang action movie. There is a scene in the movie where Batman stops his car, lays out, everything stops, he lays out a bomb, the bomb blow up, and he speeds away.

It's a Smithsonian on just how completely disrespectful this film is to everything it's supposed to portray.And what's up with the comically fat Gordon? He's useless.

Oh well.Finally, this film is so lazily written that it just glosses over moments in it that make absolutely NO sense. Like how Batman's rope magically wraps around a gargoyle to KILL the Joker, which is pretty darn bad in the first place. This isn't a small continuity blooper that you MIGHT notice, it's more like WOW! When did that happen! Also, I guess it's supposed to be exiting when the Joker manages to shot down Batman's plane with his big gun, but dude, it makes NO sense. And all of a sudden, a dangerous fugitive who has just poisoned the whole city, offers a bunch of cash, and the whole city of Gotham just figures he's a nice guy, and flocks to him, without even so much as the police int he way of this huge parade that he just magically managed to whip up. This film is lazily written to be a big bang-boom action film, without any respect to the source material, or, for that matter, the characters that it, by itself, is trying to portray.Ultimately, I give this film the dignity of 2\/10 because of a few enjoyable moments, but seriously, you could find better ways to waste your brain away.I'm out. ","genre":"Action, Adventure"},{"date":"19 July 2005","score":"32 out of 54 people found the following review useful","review":" WARNING SPOILERS LIE AHEAD!!! Not that you should really care.Okay, so I am a bit biased as a Batman fan, but speaking for Batman fans in general, I must say it is impossible to be a true Batman fan and enjoy this atrocity. Tim Burton himself has said that he would never read a comic book, which, right there, explains the extraordinary lack of respect o the source material that this film contains. Anything that disrespects the source material that it is based on, especially something as grand and wonderful as the Batman mythos, this much should be shamed.Let's start with the basic formula. This is a superhero movie. It is based off the comic book. So why, instead of having the main love interest from the comics, Catwoman, which offers an insightful look at the psyche of the Bat, and shows a great psychological story, have some dumb bimbo, played to the Nth degree of ANNOYING by Kim Basinger, be the love interest? Honestly, she spends all her on screen time screaming and whining, it is impossible to see why Batman would be attracted to her, especially considering that he is BATMAN! He is dark figure with a Really messed up psyche, making him impossible to connect to, and really isn't one for love interests. that is why Catwoman is the great love interest that she is. She shares his dark psyche, and they are truly soul mates. But apparently Hollywood just wanted to go with the hot bimbo storyline, that completely contradicts who the character in the movie is in the first place, than give a great, insightful look at what makes Batman Batman.Okay, that's actually not even my fifth biggest complaint. If you want my biggest complaint, it's Michael Keaton. Okay, we all know what Batman looks like. He's a man who has trained his body to physical perfection over decades, and is a master of every fighting style known to man, so he knows how to fight his way through fifty men. What do we get her? Scrawny, curly-haired Michael Keaton shoved in a giant rubber body suit in which he can't move, so he just throws a little punch her, maybe a kick here...Geez Louise! Now, if you were to say to pretty much anyone that Jack Nicholson is not a great actor, you would probably be shunned from existence. But for a character like the Joker, Nicholson is all wrong. I mean, Tom Hanks is a great actor, but you wouldn't cast him as Superman, would you? The Joker is supposed to be a lean, long-faced, high-pitched voice, squealing madman who is completely incoherent, and does enjoys just laughing and killing people. Nicholson just does it all wrong, but it's not really his fault at all. He's just completely miscast.

Despite not having Craven at the helm, the film still has that style he is famous for. I was a little taken aback when I saw on IMDb that people hated this film?? I was completely blown away by this seemingly campy film. It wasn't campy at all, in fact just the opposite it appeared to be a big budget retelling of Dracula that worked on every angle.Dracula 2000 begins with Matthew Van Helsing, who is secretly protecting Dracula in an enormous vault, is robbed. The thieves think they are going to find riches beyond their dreams but instead they find a coffin so determined to leave with something they take the coffin. On a place over Lousiana they try to open the coffin and they unleash the infamous Dracula. When Van Helsing discovers Dracula is gone he immediately knows what Dracula is after and leaves for America. His protégé Simon secretly follows him wanting to know what he's doing. Dracula is hunting for Van Helsing's daughter. Van Helsing has been using Dracula's blood for the last century to keep himself alive in order to protect the world from Dracula, so his daughter was born with Dracula's blood inside her. Dracula tracks her down and leaves a wake of vampire conversions in his path, each one determined to serve him and stop anyone trying to stop him. Van Helsing meets his end finally and now Simon is the only one who can stop Dracula from taking Mary Van Helsing. In the final battle Mary will discover once and for all the true identity of Dracula and everything he stands for.Gerard Butler who as of recent has impressed me with performances in Dear Frankie and Phantom of The Opera is stunning as Dracula. Perhaps one of the best performances of the infamous vampire I have ever seen. Despite being a story that's been done to death in numerous different ways and styles, Dracula 2000 finds a fresh new twist in Dracula's origin and Gerard Butler plays it amazingly. He's sultry, dark, evil, emotionless and yet torn up, tormented and someone you can't help feel sorry for. One of the grandest moves by the film makers of Dracula 2000 is to swamp the cast with hot new or up and comers in Hollywood. Colleen Fitzpatrick (aka Vitamin C), Jennifer Esposito, Omar Epps, Sean Patrick Thomas, Danny Masterson, Jeri Ryan, Shane West, Nathan Fillion...just a myriad of low level but hot young actors that all play vampires eventually and do a great job. Then they bring on two much more diversified and perhaps you might say seasoned actors to play the two adversaries Gerard Butler (Dracula) and the amazing Christopher Plummer (Van Helsing) who as of recent tends to play cameo roles and brief appearances but I was pleased to see him in over an hour of the film. With equal amount of horror and action the film was intense and non-stop and not toned down so it was full of blood and gore which is necessary for a film about vampires. The absolutely original and very unique origin story of Dracula makes a whole new spin on the character and I am thrilled about how that played out. The film takes us from a more familiar Dracula locale (Europe...England to be exact) to New Orleans during Mardis Gras, and the locations are brilliantly filmed and work the story perfectly. The film is no brilliant academy award winner but we're not looking for that when you watch Dracula 2000...instead we are looking to be entertained and the film does that completely!! Horror or action fans check this out...I can't wait to see the follow ups to this series. 9\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"19 July 2005","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Patrick Lussier has worked with Wes Craven for a long time, through all three of the scream films and must know Craven's style and a little something about horror.

It was a film surrounding space travel and life in space in the future by one of the world's most celebrated filmmakers, Stanley Kubrick. '2001' was Stanley Kubrick's first big-budget film, his most memorable film and many film critics and movie buffs alike agree it's his most genius work. Part of the reason why '2001' was such a hit was because of the amazing special effects (for the time - it was 1968) and the haunting and brooding classical music score that blended perfectly into the peace and quiet of outer space. While wowing audiences with its spectacular visual effects, '2001' also challenged their intelligence and view on human life with deep philosophical ideas and messages lodged deep inside science-fiction picture. People have praised '2001 A Space Odyssey' as being the crowning work of an extraordinarily gifted filmmaker ahead of his time, and other have panned it as being jumbled, frustrating, deliberately confusing and very undeserving of it's praise. I have finally witnessed one of cinema's most talked about and debated over epics, and I can assure you it's not only an excellent movie, it's one of the best made motion pictures of all time, thanks entirely to the very meticulous and conscientious vision of Stanley Kubrick, the finest film director to ever grace the world.'2001 A Space Odyssey' is set in the beautiful and peaceful confides of outer space, where humans (mostly doctors and scientists) do astrological research from expansive spacecrafts. A lot of what we have today (and what we had when the book '2001' is based upon was written) has now been replaced with artificial intelligence (robots) in Stanley Kubrick's invisionment of what the year 2001 would look like, taken of course from Arthur Clarke's groundbreaking and controversial novel. The story surrounds two doctors on a mission up in space, Dr. Dave Bowman (Keir Dullea) and Dr. Frank Poole (Gary Lockwood). Their mission is leads them to the moon, to find an artificial relic, which can lead to the discovery to a new and mysterious life form. The two are helped by H.A.L., the creepy-voiced computer of the spacecraft, who develops a mind of it's own and eventually turns on them. H.A.L. turns on the two astronauts when he (it, really) refuses to save them in fear it will jeopardize their mission. The film becomes a sort-of survival story after that for Dave (Frank dies, when he is failed to be saved by H.A.L.) which eventually leads him to what the mission is looking for, taking him on a five minute journey filled with vibrant and e colors and graphics through the depths of outer space, eventually resulting in Dave seeing himself aging and eventually dying, and being re-born as a extra-terrestrial. 2001's ending may be one of the most talked about, debated and argued about film endings of all time. There is no solid explanation for it, and Mr. Kubrick (as well as author Arthur Clarke) leave it up to you (the viewer) to figure out. I personally found the ending to be extremely frustrating and mind-numbing the first time I saw it. I just couldn't grasp it, until about four days later I began to deeply admire it. In my opinion, '2001' is very anti-technology (hinting it will one day destroy us), but offers hope for us in the future. Stanley Kubrick provides the absolute best direction of his career with '2001 A Space Odyssey' that it is nothing short of appalling he didn't receive the Oscar for 'Best Director'. Without Kubrick, there couldn't have been a movie of '2001', period. Only his rich, elaborate, sophisticated and undeniably gorgeous could make '2001' what it is then and today. In other words, if any other filmmaker was to touch it, the project would crash and burn. Kubrick fills the movie with aching beauty ever second of the runtime, not only with the direction but the screenplay he co-wrote with the famous novel's author, Arthur C. Clarke. The acting in '2001' is really nothing special, but it doesn't have to be because the last thing '2001' is about is the performances. Keir Dullea, Gary Lockwood, William Sylvester, Leonard Rossiter and Douglas Rain (who provides the chilling voice of the vengeful computer, H.A.L.) are all decent, but nothing really memorable (well, just Douglas Rain's voice). The film suffers by being a tad overlong, and it's also very slow moving in the beginning, but I forgive it for that. The film's cinematography, visual effects, musical score, set decoration, screenplay and sound were all Academy Award worthy, and in my opinion '2001' should have taken home the Oscar for 'Best Motion Picture of the Year', but it wasn't even nominated. If that doesn't prove to you how short-sighted and ignorant the Academy voters are, I don't know what will!In conclusion, I don't even recommend '2001'. I plead, no I demand, you dash to your local videostore and rent a copy. You may enjoy it, you may not, but you will definitely be thinking about it the next morning and it will for sure enlighten you. '2001' isn't as much of a film as it is a landmark in cinema. '2001' set the bar for many extraordinary motion pictures to come, and I'll say it again, none of it would be possible without the genius of Mr. Stanley Kubrick. If you've already seen it, I recommend you buy it on DVD, along with Kubrick's other films in his DVD Collection including his work from 1962 to 1999. '2001' may bore you a little, but when it's all over it will give you a slightly different view on things.

Jenna Elfman, one of the banes of my existence for her oh so quirky perky characters, but mostly because she asserted once that AIDS victims were suffering needlessly because the disease was all in their minds, is an actress that I try to stay from for many reasons, at all costs. Unfortunately my parents didn't get my memo regarding this subject because they not only recommended this film, but shoved the DVD in my hands on a recent visit and sent me home to watch it.Surprisingly, neither the film nor Jenna Elfman was annoying. Approximately twenty years ago, Brian (Norton) and Jake (Stiller) became close friends with Anna (Elfman) when she stood up to a bully for them. Her family inevitably moves from New York to California the following year, and they don't see one another until Anna calls Brian, now a Catholic priest, to tell him that she is coming into town and wants to get together with he and Jake, now a Rabbi. The two friends, known colloquially as the God Squad grew even closer over the years after Anna's departure and managed to bring new ideas and unconventionality to their respective positions, make them two of the most popular holy guys in their neighborhoods. Jake is being pressured to date and find a wife because there has never been a head Rabbi in his congregation that was single, so he has to endure endless set-ups by congregation members and their daughters. This all changes when Anna returns and she and Jake begin a secret relationship, no strings attached. Unfortunately their feelings for one another become very strong and Jake must cope with the reality of his position and the effect that an interfaith relationship could have on his congregation. In the meantime, Brian has been developing feelings for Anna himself and, not knowing about the secret relationship going on under his nose, starts to question his own faith and position, wondering if he should chuck it all for the chance of a secular life with Anna.Keeping the Faith is Edward Norton's directorial debut, a rather curious notion because I would have expected something a little less conventional and heart-warming than this film turned out to be. This is not to say that he didn't do a good job; he did &#150; there weren't any obvious pacing issues and he was able to capitalize on the obvious chemistry the three of them shared. Unfortunately, perhaps because of his dual role as director, or perhaps it was completely intentional and in the script, his role is billed as a main character, but he racks up a lot less screen time than the other two principals. Certainly this is a minor quibble with the overall film. All of the performances were good (particularly that of Anne Bancroft, who has a small but pivotal role as Jake's mother), but nothing dynamic. Frankly, however, going into this film I would have settled for not annoying, so it worked for me.After watching Keeping the Faith I felt like I had eaten a tuna melt on white bread; it tasted okay, but it could have been so much better if it had just been on some hearty rye. The general idea behind and execution of Keeping the Faith was okay, but I was left wanting more. Whether that is possible with this material is something that I'm not sure of, but I AM certain of one thing; I may not be a religious person, but I was thanking my lucky stars that the role of Anna was not played by Meg Ryan.

I didn't much care for Hamburger Hill, The Big Red One, We Were Soldier, Windtalkers and 1941 with a passion, but loved Saving Private Ryan, Platoon and Apocalypse Now. The last four are probably the only war films made I'd praise as brilliant, but the rest are filled to the brim with tired clichés. 'Full Metal Jacket' was the most recent war film I've seen, and I really didn't know what to expect. Coming from the extraordinarily talented Stanley Kubrick I felt it would be engrossing and captivating as his other masterworks, but I wasn't entirely sure. You see, critics really rammed 'Full Metal Jacket' as being nothing more then mediocre. The critics praised all of Kubrick's other films, even 'Eyes Wide Shut' which I found to be so devastatingly average, uninventive and in poor taste. I felt if film critics dare to put down the man himself, the film has got to be terrible. Well, when those end credits started to energetically roll to The Rolling Stones' 'Painted Black' I realized I had witnessed one of the finest war movies ever created, and definitely the funniest. 'Full Metal Jacket' is a well-written, nicely acted and superbly directed electrifying jolt of energy that will wake you up and get your attention like a soldering iron to the head!'Full Metal Jacket' follows Private J.T. 'Joker' Davis (Mathew Modine - Pacific Heights) and his journey through the long, tough and harsh conditions the Vietnam war had to offer. The first half of the film deals with him in military boot camp, under the supervision of perhaps cinema's most and biggest loud mouth army guy, Gunnery Sergeant Hartman (R. Lee Ermey - Mississippi Burning). He and the other soldiers in training, including Private Cowboy (Arliss Howard - Tequila Sunrise) and the fat, silly and certifiably violently insane Private Leonard Lawrence, or how Sergeant Hartman calls him - Private Gomer Pyle. For the first half of the two hour film, the story follows the soldiers as the try to survive both psychically and mentally through the harsh and merciless training of Sergeant Hartman. The film then transitions to about a year later, where we find Private Joker working as a war photographer along side his close friend Private Rafterman (Kevyn Major Howard - Alien Nation). As a war photographer, Joker and Rafterman experience hardships when they get caught in the middle of a dangerous series of battles involving cadets such as the smart-ass Private Eightball (Dorian Harewood - Sudden ) and the tough and bigoted 'Animal Mother' played by 'The Inside''s Adam Baldwin (who by the way is of no relation to Alec, Stephen, Daniel or Billy). 'Full Metal Jacket' is blackly funny, philosophical and heart-breaking all at the same time, a task that really couldn't be done by anyone else besides the incredible Stanley Kubrick. This is Kubrick's war film and although it isn't his best work, it was definitely good enough for me. Stanley Kubrick deserved an Academy Award for his powerful, effective and uncompromising vision molding this short story into a stunning and impassioned motion picture that will be remembered as one of the great war films. Don't get me wrong, 'Full Metal Jacket' isn't nearly as consequential or remarkable as say 'Clockwork Orange', '2001' or 'Dr. Strangelove', the movie, although brilliant, has it's number of flaws. The first half of the film is near-perfect, but the second half drags significantly until the final vigorous, aggressive and powerful fifteen minutes. The acting is strong for the most part, with a satisfying lead performance by Mathew Modine. Dorian Harewood, Adam Baldwin and Arliss Howard are solid in all their parts, but the two stand-outs are Vincent D'Onofrio and the gnarly R. Lee Ermey. D'Onofrio is outstanding in providing us with his character's transformation from fat, silly hick farm boy to hardened and ultimately cold-blooded sociopath hungry for war . R. Lee Ermey is as hysterical as he is brilliant as the tough-as-nails foul-mouthed boot camp Sergeant from hell (the most memorably character of the film). Both Ermey and D'Onofrio deserved Academy Award nominations for Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role, but unfortunately and predictably didn't get it (the Academy has always been short-sighted when it comes to Kubrick's talent and genius.) 'Full Metal Jacket' includes amazing film editing from Martin Hunter and an excellent soundtrack capturing the spirit of music of the time period.While 'Full Metal Jacket' isn't Stanley Kubrick's finest production, it is certainly his most action-packed. War movie fans among Kubrick fans will enjoy this darkly funny and shockingly realistic motion picture that faultlessly paints a portrait of what the experience of fighting in Vietnam was actually like. I recommend 'Full Metal Jacket' despite it's shortcomings to anyone who doesn't mind harsh and harsh language (which especially comes spewing out of the mouth of R.

I had never seen it - although I remember of the Cole Porter musical version, High Society from childhood. The casting of Cary Grant, Katherine Hepburn and James Stewart was certainly an intriguing proposition. From the opening scene with Tracy (Hepburn) breaking Dexter's (Grant) clubs on her knee and him pushing her to the ground in one of the weirdest pieces of domestic violence on celluloid, I was hooked. Despite her 'goddessness' and reserve, the relationship between Tracy and Dexter crackles with a vital force. Moments later, when Tracy pushes her new fiancé to the floor in a bit of horseplay, you can see her trying to invoke the same spiritedness into her new relationship and failing badly. The arrival of chippy writer Macaulay 'Mike' Connor (Stewart) and hardheaded photographer Liz Imbrie (superbly played by Ruth Hussey) at the Lord's mansion for the wedding is excellently realised. As they sit in the 'South Parlour' awaiting their hosts and notice another door, Connor dryly describes it as The -south-by-southwest parlour by dining room. The sniping between the ex-husband, the unwanted journalists and the refined but flawed Lord family is superbly written. Films of this era have such zinging dialogue - it is after all the golden era of Hollywood writers, with greats like Raymond Chandler and F. Scott Fitzgerald working for the studios - but the quality of dialogue in black and white never fails to surprise me. The booziness of the party the night before the wedding changes pretty much everyone's ideas about everyone else, except for the level-headed Liz and the sober Dexter. The acting at the party, after it back at the Lords mansion and the hangovers the following day are both excellent and hilarious (Stewart's hiccups were unscripted and you can clearly see Grant trying to control himself).

","genre":"Comedy, Romance"},{"date":"19 July 2005","score":"","review":" This was not a great movie in any way, yet somehow there was something appealing to it which made it not the worst movie I have ever witnessed. You walk into this film with a level of expectancy. You want to see the same characters, stories, and clichéd moments that you did while watching the television show, and you do. The characters are creative, the story is very similar to the cartoon, and the clichéd moments are there in full force. Coming from a household that used to religiously watch this cartoon, I wanted this level of security, and I found it in this film. As a film watcher, I don't want to see the director of this film taking too many original risks and really destroying the culture of the cartoon. It stayed true to its roots, and for that you cannot fault this film. There were some humorous moments that made you think back to the cartoon, there were silly times where you just had to shrug and breathe in deeply, then there were some horrid moments that really just made you reach for the STOP button on your DVD player. Yet, I was expecting this. So, coming from an expectancy perspective, it was perfect. Coming from an entertainment value, it could have been a bit tighter.To begin, the actors. I agree that a remake like this may not have garnished the cream of the crop of Hollywood hitters, but I believe we could have done a bit better than Freddy Prinze, Jr. and Matthew Lillard. Sarah Michelle Gellar, I believe, could have been better as well. Here we have some C level players who are a huge hit with the teen audiences, bringing to life characters, which were created during an older generation's time. It just seemed a bit jumbled to me. Then, to make matters even more confusing, we had the famed Rowan Atkinson as the sneaky Spooky Island owner. Disappointing acting coupled with the great Mr. Bean doesn't quite fit for me. He should have been used so much more to his potential. He could have stolen this film from the others and made it into his own, but for some strange reason, bland acting breeds more bland acting, so you can't expect much.Outside of the acting, there isn't much else going on. Nearly everything that happens we have seen time and time again through the cartoons.

Not only because the story is situated about 90 years ago, but also because this is a movie from a time period in which they still knew how to make epic movies without too many special things around it. They didn't have computers to enhance all their images, but had to rely on excellent acting, a great story and what nature provided them with. And all these things are amazing in this movie.

I find it a strong element in the script that the faults of Bostonians, an allegorical composite for super-rich-government connected types, are discredited---with the qualities that describe unrealistic power-mongers--inability to enjoy simplicity, lack of a sense of humor, intolerance, frigidity in sex, inability to seek amity, unwillingness to compromise on nonessential points, bigotry against all those poorer or differently, worship of power...all the traits that define corporate-man of the U.S. increasingly throughout the 20th Century (but have the opposite quality of truly American values). The film is gentle, deliberate in pace and pits two screwball comedy types, the seemingly over-macho but lovable brute and the seemingly stuck-up by basically-goodhearted girl against one another; and from the beginning as his steely spirit and her iron resolve meet sharply , sparks fly. In the film's focused storyline, a youthful, would-be heiress from Boston, Ameiia (Elizabeth Allen), travels from her cold, snowy and overly-formal zone of existence to locate her father, missing since WWII. She had been born near the beginning of that Pacific conflict; but he stayed in French Polynesia and has never seen her. He stands to inherit millions, that is the prospect; she needs to prove that he is morally unfit in order to overturn that provision of a will. The assumption is he must be living in sin, he's in paradise--not Boston. She is met not by her errant papa but by his friend, Guns Donovan, an ex-sailor, and a man who who owns the local saloon, 'Donovan's Reef'. What she does not know is the father has had three children since, by a Polynesian mother. It takes time, a brawl over a shared birthday, meeting and growing to love the people, some tense scenes with her father, ceremonies, arguments, a water-skiing contretemps involving two sorts of bathing suit representing Boston and Polynesia and an opportunistic play for her by the governor that the girl finally melts--in so far as iron can. She decides it is more logical to stay with Donovan than to deny her feelings, and her love for the island. Donovan spanks her, the Amelia that was; but the action is symbolic, for from this point on they will be equals,; his brawling partner will own 'Gilhooley's Reef' and and they will make a life together where people get along and respect one another's differences. . The film is an amiable service-style comedy--John Ford is never far from cavalry-post humor--and the build of the romance from a hotly-denied spark through incidents, misassumptions, mutual interactions and learnings prepares us not for surrender but for a warlike alliance at the end; and for a procession of priests, friends, children, Gilhooley, her father, and a huge French policeman bearing her worldly goods to Donovan's house in train behind the happy couple. The cinematography by William Clothier and the art direction by Sam Imazu and veteran Hal Pereira are I found often stunning.

","genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Romance"},{"date":"19 July 2005","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" I am a huge fan of both Christopher Walken and Robert De Niro, so I have wanted to watch this film for quite some time. De Niro's and Walken's performances are outstanding, and Walken most definitely deserved his Oscar for it. My issue is with the director.I noticed the slow pacing within the first five to ten minutes. I have nothing inherently against slow pacing (I also am a fan of M. Night Shyamalan), so I am not completely a victim of the MTV, attention deficit crowd, but surely there must be a line. However, I continued watching. I watched as the characters prepared for a wedding. I watched as they had the wedding. I watched the wedding reception. All of these events, taking place, I assume, over the course of a week or two, seemed, in my mind, to unfold in real time.There then came a scene with the characters hunting deer. When Robert De Niro's character raised his rifle at a deer, and the deer ran away, and he lowered his rifle, I became convinced that the director was determined to capture a deer hunting expedition with such realism and accuracy that I myself wanted to fall asleep behind a deer blind. Or else perhaps take the role of the deer itself, who seemed to have the most exciting part, and was put out of its misery before the boredom became intolerable.When the film finally got around to showing Vietnam, I was overjoyed, thinking that perhaps something would happen other than people sitting around, smoking, drinking, and talking over one another. I never was a fan of King of the Hill, and I certainly don't want to watch the movie version. And relatively speaking, the Vietnam scenes WERE more exciting. Although, disillusioned from the first hour, I nearly had the overwhelming urge to play Russian Roulette myself. But still, the moments of action in the Vietnam portion of the film were sparse, and liberally cushioned by long moments of silence, the likes of which would make Samuel Beckett hit Stop. After two hours, I became distinctly aware of the rising coldness in my stomach that indicated it would not be getting better. Already I had almost completely taken my attention from the movie to more action-packed distractions like reading a book, or clipping my toenails.I had not heard of the director, Michael Cimino, before The Deer Hunter, and having seen it, I'm not sure I will be rushing to the video store any time soon to watch any of his other work. Although I am not a professional filmmaker, and he is, I can give this much advice it's OK to cut things out of your movie. I know, you are quite convinced that everything you left in was absolutely essential to the artistic success of the film, but you don't NECESSARILY have to show a hunter preparing to shoot a deer, only to find the deer run away. This is not something vital to the integrity of the picture. It's OK to remove that. It's not entirely necessary to show every dance that the wedding guests go through. You can cut a couple of them out.I have nothing against movies with slow pacing. It's not the pacing that I have a problem with. I don't need constant action, just substance. There is a difference between lack of action and lack of substance. You can have a perfectly substantial scene with zero action, and there is an alarming number of examples of movies that have plenty of action, but zero substance. This film had a lot of dead air, a lot of parts that had no action and no substance.Now, if you'll excuse me, I've thought about the film too much, and I need to take a nap.
