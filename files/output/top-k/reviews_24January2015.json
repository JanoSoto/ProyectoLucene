[{"date":"24 January 2015","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Ugh. Stallone once commented that he wished he'd never made this movie, and I can't help but agree with him DRIVEN is a complete load of tosh and a stain on the careers of both the actor as well as director Renny Harlin, a guy who's made his fair share of codswallop in his time.DRIVEN is a flashy, nonsensical racing drama, filled with all of the cheesy jump cut editing that you'd expect from a first-time director just learning the ropes, not a guy who once made the classic that is DIE HARD 2 and who directed Stallone in the engaging action flick CLIFFHANGER. Beneath the style there's very little substance indeed, with the film focusing on the boring young characters while leaving the seasoned pros (Stallone, Burt Reynolds) on the sidelines with little to do.Even worse, the story is littered with discrepancies and plot holes, from criminal actions having no comeuppance to the general anything-to-win theme, which is all over the place. The race scenes themselves should be the highlight of this production but they're dull beyond belief, interspersed with some awful CGI shots. I don't have a single good word to say about this movie, other than that I've seen worse, but that really ISN'T a commendation.
