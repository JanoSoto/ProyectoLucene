Basically seventeen year old Geneviève Emery (Catherine Deneuve) lives in an umbrella shop in Cherbourg with her widowed mother Madame Emery (Anne Vernon), and she is secretly in love with twenty year old auto mechanic Guy Foucher (Nino Castelnuovo), and the two of them want to get married. She reveals this to her mother however, and she objects thinking that her daughter is too young and that he is not mature and well-established enough, and he may be required to do military service, and shortly later he is sent to Algeria after being drafted to serve in the war, but before leaving he and Geneviève consummate their love. Following this Geneviève is pregnant, while he is away he hardly communicates and they have drifted apart, so she listens to her mother's strong encouragement to accept a marriage proposal from Roland Cassard (Marc Michel) (he previously appeared as the same character in the film Lola), the affluent gem dealer who is in love with her and promises to bring her child up as his own. Guy is discharged from service before his two year term is up due to being wounded, he returns home and finds out Geneviève is married with a child and has moved away, and following this he sinks into deep depression and anger, which he struggles to control. But Guy recovers from his state when he falls in love and married young Madeleine (Ellen Farner) who had been caring for his aunt Élise (Mireille Perrey), who is now deceased, and she left him an inheritance which he uses to fulfil his ambition to open a service station. Years pass, and Geneviève, who is now discernibly wealthy, has returned home with Françoise (Rosalie Varda), her and Guy's daughter, and have an accidental meeting at his service station, their short conversation is obviously filled with unuttered fondness and regret, and in the end they finally part ways. Also starring Jean Champion as Aubin and Harald Wolff as Monsieur Dubourg. Deneuve is beautiful and gives a great delicate performance as the young woman longing for love from one man until fate changes everything, Castelnuovo is interesting as the man who is in and out of her life, and Michel is likable as the wealthy man with good intentions. The story is relatively simple, complicated romance, but what makes this musically distinctive is that every scene has singing, from the most mundane conversations to emotionally charging moments every word is spoken and sun in tune, and the picture has good use of vivid colour and design as well, it is a fantastic musical. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Song for I Will Wait for You, Best Original Music for Michel Legrand and Jacques Demy, Best Music Adaptation or Treatment for Michel Legrand, Best Writing, Story and Screenplay - Written Directly for the Screen for Demy and Best Foreign Language Film, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Foreign-Language Foreign Film.

The film has nothing but everything to do with the duo as the film opens and closes with the two in toe, some of the most rememberable one liners of the films contain the duo as they nock off an ordinary LA diner.As the film progresses we are introduced to two new characters, Vincent Vega (John Travolta) and Jules Winnfield ( Samuel L Jackson) both hired guns en route to a hit. Vincent seems ever the realist, slow talking cool and confident, Jules the poetic, religious man dog. The speeches between the two characters throughout the film are both realistic, yet pointless pillow talk, that gives the film a somewhat believable quality no matter how far fetched some of the stories may be, Tarantino has the nack of making them sound true by adding this banter between scenes, almost acting as an air break or rest stop from the action and violence.Later on we meet Mia Wallace (Uma Thurman) the wife of Marsellus Wallace (Ving Rhames) The kingpin of the Tarantino underworld. Uma is cool, sexy and always something has to say. Her mysterious entrance is made when Vincent Vega is asked by Marsellu, if he would take care of her for the night while he is out of town. This in it's self is another story and another adventure in the film, Vincent takes her out for lunch at the well known but not so famous, Jack Rabbit Slims this scene again is one of the most iconic and talked about moments from the film. Here we also also exposed to Tarantino's rockabilly music taste which encompasses the film so well.Bruce Willis makes his way onto the screen in Pulp Fiction as a one hit KO boxer,Butch Coolidge. his story begins with the Gold Watch story, this gold watch symbolises Butch''s drive through life, as we learn that the watch has survived through many war's struggles and pains, if a simple gold watch can make it this far, so can butch. His drive through the film is to escape an accidental murder, the result of a boxing match, however many pitfalls await him and his girlfriend Fabienne (Maria de Medeiros)Just a light intro to the film and it's colourful characters within, but all in all a timeless classic and a must see for any film buff, or anyone that watches films in this case, I struggle to find anyone that doesn't have at least one good thing to say about this film, as it contains all the qualities of a masterpiece to be talked about time and time again!Hard to believe this film is almost 20 years old!

It's certainly the weakest film in the franchise, which is upsetting since its technically the first, but there's still a lot of good in this film that I think the major fans never think about when they criticize this, Liam Neeson boasts a fantastic performance as Qui-Gon Jinn, his dialogue is terrific and at times quite inspirational even for reality, the soundtrack is once again fantastic, the effects are superb, Darth Maul is a terrific, memorable post-Darth Vader villain (even if his screen time is very limited) and any scene with C3PO, R2D2 or Yoda would bring a smile to any fans face. I will admit this film is a major disappointment for any fan of the franchise and there is honestly much more to complain about than to give praise to, first off the story takes forever to actually get going, over an hour in and we are still in Tatooine watching amateur pod racing, the comic relief is brutal, it's handled with pure class in the original three, but here it isn't even funny, particularly Jar Jar Binks, who is just horror to watch, also the main villain isn't introduced until about ninety minutes in, and is (spoiler ahead) killed off way too early, Darth Maul could have been terrific as the main villain of the entire prequels , serving as this trilogies Vader. I like many of the performances, but there are many, many cringe worthy ones as well, a tone of the characters with brief dialogue deliver it with no charisma, some of the voice actors are uninspired and others are quite racist, Natalie Portman literally just says her lines, and the worst part of the entire movie has to be Jake Lloyd, who is extremely irritating, dosen't say any of his dialogue the way he is suppose to and probably didn't even understand the story, but it isn't his fault really, he was only nine years old, George Lucas clearly couldn't direct him, age is no exception when you're making a movie, you should be telling your actors when they're doing a poor job, and strive to improve them. It has many great moments, but more so there are many imperfections, it's very hard to recommend Star Wars Episode I the Phantom Menace, but if you're watching the entire series, there is no way it can be missed.

It's certainly the weakest film in the franchise, which is upsetting since its technically the first, but there's still a lot of good in this film that I think the major fans never think about when they criticize this, Liam Neeson boasts a fantastic performance as Qui-Gon Jinn, his dialogue is terrific and at times quite inspirational even for reality, the soundtrack is once again fantastic, the effects are superb, Darth Maul is a terrific, memorable post-Darth Vader villain (even if his screen time is very limited) and any scene with C3PO, R2D2 or Yoda would bring a smile to any fans face. I will admit this film is a major disappointment for any fan of the franchise and there is honestly much more to complain about than to give praise to, first off the story takes forever to actually get going, over an hour in and we are still in Tatooine watching amateur pod racing, the comic relief is brutal, it's handled with pure class in the original three, but here it isn't even funny, particularly Jar Jar Binks, who is just horror to watch, also the main villain isn't introduced until about ninety minutes in, and is (spoiler ahead) killed off way too early, Darth Maul could have been terrific as the main villain of the entire prequels , serving as this trilogies Vader. I like many of the performances, but there are many, many cringe worthy ones as well, a tone of the characters with brief dialogue deliver it with no charisma, some of the voice actors are uninspired and others are quite racist, Natalie Portman literally just says her lines, and the worst part of the entire movie has to be Jake Lloyd, who is extremely irritating, dosen't say any of his dialogue the way he is suppose to and probably didn't even understand the story, but it isn't his fault really, he was only nine years old, George Lucas clearly couldn't direct him, age is no exception when you're making a movie, you should be telling your actors when they're doing a poor job, and strive to improve them. It has many great moments, but more so there are many imperfections, it's very hard to recommend Star Wars Episode I the Phantom Menace, but if you're watching the entire series, there is no way it can be missed.

This said, the remake does need to be re-watched to see whether that's correct or not. This film is not perfect, and is not as good as The 39 Steps, Sabotage and especially The Lady Vanishes of the 30s British period Hitchcocks but is definitely worth seeing still. It did come across as too short, so the story had a tendency to be rushed and convoluted, and there are times where the action was on the stiff side. The Man Who Knew Too Much is well made still, the settings and locations are a wonder to behold and fit the story like a glove while the photography is atmospheric and professionally done. The music from Arthur Benjamin has a haunting sweeping quality, not among the all-time great Hitchcock film scores but very competent and fits the mood of the film well. The script has a fresh wit and the gallows humour that it's laced with is still humorous and holds up relatively well, the scripting for the more suspenseful scenes is good too and doesn't detract. The story is not perfect, but is mostly interesting and suspenseful, with some great scenes like the chair scene, the dentist scene and the climax.

Most Star Wars fans won't consider it a work of art, but it is a huge improvement from the Phantom Menace no doubt, the story is well executed, the character development is much better and the comic relief is great, it was unbearable in Phantom Menace, with new character Jar Jar Binks being the main source of laughs, this time around it is back to C3P0, which made me very happy, his lines were genuinely funny and not just cringe to listen to. There are some poor moments in this film, while I do think Hayden Christensen shines in some scenes, particularly the one with his mother, he is very weak many times, particularly his parts with Natalie Portman, there is no chemistry between either of them, no indication of passion and all of their dialogue is very cliché, I think they wanted Anakin and Padmé's relationship to be the Han and Leia of the prequels, but they didn't succeed. The performances are much better this time around, Ewan McGregor steals the show as Obi-Wan Kenobi, he wasn't worth much praise in the first one, but this time he is playing a much older and wiser version of the character, which he delivered very well and is one of the highlights of the prequel trilogy, Christopher Lee is outstanding as the villain, though this film once again suffers from taking a ridiculously long time before introducing us to its main villain, there are also great performances from Samuel L. Jackson and, of course, voice actors Anthony Daniels and Frank Oz, who is given a bigger and better role as Yoda this time around that is sure to please fans. Though it may still be missing that sci-fi magic that is very evident in the original trilogy, Star Wars Episode II-Attack of the Clones is still a very enjoyable movie that should impress fans, I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good adventure or sci-fi film.

In It's a Wonderful Life, we have James Stewart's George Bailey who, like I mentioned before, is your average small-town American gentlemen. Kind, friendly and helpful and always looking out for others around him. This is also his weakness, because he sacrifices so many of his life ambitions like travelling the world to save the local people of Bedford Hills from the tycoon that is Lionel Barrymore's Henry Potter. Because he never reached these goals and spends most of his time fighting off the advances of Mr. Potter to seize the town, he becomes tired of life and extremely cynical. For a man so loved by the local people, George felt very unappreciated for all the sacrifices he had made throughout his life. So when his Uncle Billy misplaces an important $8,000 cheque and the bank examiner discovers this, George begins a rampage across town and finally ends up at a bridge, ready to end his life. However, just as he is about to jump in, an angel appears, ready to show him his life's true meaning and prevent him from going through with his plan. The angel does this by showing George what life would have been like had he not existed. Of course, his family and friends all turn out worse off and the town had been fully taken over and commercialised by Mr. Potter. James Stewart, although very good as the charming but reluctant and living George Bailey, is perfect as the never lived George Bailey, and his scenes where he discovers life without him are emotionally devastating and Stewart makes you feel for his character throughout. Donna Reed is superb as George's loving and caring wife Mary as are the rest of a huge supporting cast that includes Lionel Barrymore, Henry Travers and Thomas Mitchell.Although it's ending fails to create as big an emotional impact as it promises to, (still a pretty good impact but you just expect more) It's a Wonderful Life is an uplifting masterpiece which just gets better on every viewing.

So when his Uncle Billy misplaces an important $8,000 cheque and the bank examiner discovers this, George begins a rampage across town and finally ends up at a bridge, ready to end his life. However, just as he is about to jump in, an angel appears, ready to show him his life's true meaning and prevent him from going through with his plan. The angel does this by showing George what life would have been like had he not existed. Of course, his family and friends all turn out worse off and the town had been fully taken over and commercialised by Mr. Potter. James Stewart, although very good as the charming but reluctant and living George Bailey, is perfect as the never lived George Bailey, and his scenes where he discovers life without him are emotionally devastating and Stewart makes you feel for his character throughout. Donna Reed is superb as George's loving and caring wife Mary as are the rest of a huge supporting cast that includes Lionel Barrymore, Henry Travers and Thomas Mitchell.Although it's ending fails to create as big an emotional impact as it promises to, (still a pretty good impact but you just expect more) It's a Wonderful Life is an uplifting masterpiece which just gets better on every viewing. Most people say this is the perfect Christmas movie or the perfect movie to watch if you're depressed, but I say the perfect movie to watch anytime and whatever mood you're in.

The movies I've mentioned more or before more or less tell the same story of hero raising to the top of the criminal world and then falling into hell . The Untouchables is more of a &#x85; western . It's a story about group of people that couldn't stand the injustice in their city anymore and decided to fight with it by all means necessary. Yes , it's very entertaining , but it has a lot of heart and substance too.As one of the heroes says everybody knows where evil hides , it's just nobody wants to do anything about it ( out of fear , apathy or corruption) . To fight evil you have to be even more ruthless than the criminals . You have to sometimes do illegal methods (torture , blackmail). You have to get dirty if you want to keep the streets clean . You have to be brave , because it might cost you family or life . That's the whole movie is about . It's all in the story of Elliott Ness . When we first meet him his a honest and idealistic , yet unexperienced and soft rookie when it comes to fighting crime . Through the movie he will become tough , charismatic and confident crime fighter.I don't agree with opinion that characters are one dimensional .

Later , he will become a father figure for the rest of group . He's wise , strong willed , cynical and determined . Stone (Andy Garcia) is a young rebel with a softer side. Oscar (Charles Martin Smith ) works as a good comic relief , yet people forget he's also intelligent and brave. Al Capone ( Robert de Niro) deep down is nothing , but a simple primitive street thug , yet he hides it under his gentleman behavior.Sean Connery quite probably gives the best performance of his career . The Oscar was deserved . I'm not a fan of Kevin Costner , yet he fits the role of Ness PERFECTLY . Along with Silverado  it's his best performance . He's character could be very boring since he is so noble and all , but Costner makes him a true human being you can care for. Robert de Niro has a rather small screen time and many complained about that .

They all give solid support to the main stars of the movie . The music by Ennio Morricone is BEAUTIFUL .Four friends  , The Death theme ,  Al Capone's theme  ,  The Strength of the righteous  and The Untouchables . Beautiful tracks . I need to get the soundtrack . Along with Basil Poleudoris music for Robocop this was the best soundtrack in 1987 . The art direction-set decoration and costumes are wonderful. The movie looks very elegant and takes you right into the prohibition era. David Mamet created a screenplay with incredibly stylish and memorable dialogues . Along the way there are also some surprising twists and good character development . Brian de Palma has outdone himself with the direction .

It doesn't have any of the characters from the first movie in it. It's a different film that ties it's action in with previous events. The director John McTiernan and original star Arnold Schwarzenegger turned down the project . Instead we have a relatively unknown director Stephen Hopkins and a star cast &#x96; Danny Glover , Gary Busey , Bill Paxton and Robert Davi. The plot is basically the same (alien versus armed people) , only the setting is different.Predator 2 is a disappointing sequel. The original film had good and original concept , great direction and an action star in main role. This movie has none of that. First problem &#x96; the setting. The concept of predator made sense in jungle . The jungle playground has this time been replaced by a large city (asphalt and concrete jungle , get it ?). This is a VERY bad move, it takes what was so fresh and puts the audience into too well-known territory of slasher movies.Second problem &#x96; the cast . Danny Glover is the main star in Predator 2. Here , Glover gets to play the part of Riggs instead of Murtagh and it's a very odd choice. He gives a decent performance , the best in the movie and has a certain charisma. Still , Glover as the man who could defeat Predator is simply unconvincing. I understand that movie makers wanted someone more like a regular guy this time for audience to root for , but Glover is not tough enough for action star (who was the real star of Lethal weapon &#x96; he or Gibson ?). I would suggest casting Sylvester Stallone , who can be convincing as both tough guy and regular guy at the same time , but that's me.Glover is pretty much alone in this .Schwarzenegger had great support from Carl Weaters , Bill Duke , Shane Black , Jesse Ventura and Sonny Landham . Here Glover gets annoying Maria Conchita Alonso plus Bill Paxton and boring Ruben Blades. Robert Davi appears for less than 5 minutes . Their characters aren't interesting or particularly well played. Only Gary Busey is quite nice as the FBI agent.Third problem &#x96; the story. Predator is just randomly killing people, without really toying with them or any real effort into it. The Predator is barely in the film, as there are huge sections where the Predator is absent, focusing instead on it's boring story. The story is utterly predictable , characters have rather lame dialogues and all in all the story is an excuse for blood splatter with lame characters that die very graphically in many different ways. The movie also seems to try a little bit of satire on future Los Angeles (something in Verhoeven style) , but it ends rather laughably over the top.Fourth problem &#x96; the direction. Hopkins tries to create some horror atmosphere in here , but fails . Even worse are the action scenes that feel very amateurish and are devoted of any spark. Predator 2 has a rather slow pace, fits into the horror more than action and unfortunately unfortunately, is a lot less effective in doing so. It can't settle on one mood , it tries to be both horror and action , but neither is done right. Hopkins is more interested in visual style , and while Predator 2 looks pretty cool is almost completely devoted of any real tension or excitement.The good things ? The movie looks cool. The use of Jamaican gangs seems like a original and cool idea.The music by Alan Silvestri is still good. The gadgets are cool (weapons and the ship). The movie does become fun in third act when FINALLY we get some tension and excitement. There's even some nice humor (I don't think he gives a s**t , alright , who's next). I also liked the Easter eggs (the head and the gun).It's true that Predator was a hard act to follow. However , there was no real need for the sequel to be made. If you can't do something right, don't do it at all. This is obviously MUCH better than those horrible Alien versus Predator movies ,but still a disappointment. I give it 4\/10.

It doesn't have any of the characters from the first movie in it. It's a different film that ties it's action in with previous events. The director John McTiernan and original star Arnold Schwarzenegger turned down the project . Instead we have a relatively unknown director Stephen Hopkins and a star cast &#x96; Danny Glover , Gary Busey , Bill Paxton and Robert Davi. The plot is basically the same (alien versus armed people) , only the setting is different.Predator 2 is a disappointing sequel. The original film had good and original concept , great direction and an action star in main role. This movie has none of that. First problem &#x96; the setting. The concept of predator made sense in jungle . The jungle playground has this time been replaced by a large city (asphalt and concrete jungle , get it ?). This is a VERY bad move, it takes what was so fresh and puts the audience into too well-known territory of slasher movies.Second problem &#x96; the cast . Danny Glover is the main star in Predator 2. Here , Glover gets to play the part of Riggs instead of Murtagh and it's a very odd choice. He gives a decent performance , the best in the movie and has a certain charisma. Still , Glover as the man who could defeat Predator is simply unconvincing. I understand that movie makers wanted someone more like a regular guy this time for audience to root for , but Glover is not tough enough for action star (who was the real star of Lethal weapon &#x96; he or Gibson ?). I would suggest casting Sylvester Stallone , who can be convincing as both tough guy and regular guy at the same time , but that's me.Glover is pretty much alone in this .Schwarzenegger had great support from Carl Weaters , Bill Duke , Shane Black , Jesse Ventura and Sonny Landham . Here Glover gets annoying Maria Conchita Alonso plus Bill Paxton and boring Ruben Blades. Robert Davi appears for less than 5 minutes . Their characters aren't interesting or particularly well played. Only Gary Busey is quite nice as the FBI agent.Third problem &#x96; the story. Predator is just randomly killing people, without really toying with them or any real effort into it. The Predator is barely in the film, as there are huge sections where the Predator is absent, focusing instead on it's boring story. The story is utterly predictable , characters have rather lame dialogues and all in all the story is an excuse for blood splatter with lame characters that die very graphically in many different ways. The movie also seems to try a little bit of satire on future Los Angeles (something in Verhoeven style) , but it ends rather laughably over the top.Fourth problem &#x96; the direction. Hopkins tries to create some horror atmosphere in here , but fails . Even worse are the action scenes that feel very amateurish and are devoted of any spark. Predator 2 has a rather slow pace, fits into the horror more than action and unfortunately unfortunately, is a lot less effective in doing so. It can't settle on one mood , it tries to be both horror and action , but neither is done right. Hopkins is more interested in visual style , and while Predator 2 looks pretty cool is almost completely devoted of any real tension or excitement.The good things ? The movie looks cool. The use of Jamaican gangs seems like a original and cool idea.The music by Alan Silvestri is still good. The gadgets are cool (weapons and the ship). The movie does become fun in third act when FINALLY we get some tension and excitement. There's even some nice humor (I don't think he gives a s**t , alright , who's next). I also liked the Easter eggs (the head and the gun).It's true that Predator was a hard act to follow. However , there was no real need for the sequel to be made. If you can't do something right, don't do it at all. This is obviously MUCH better than those horrible Alien versus Predator movies ,but still a disappointment. I give it 4\/10.

The Land Before Time is a classic, it's my all-time favorite animated movie that still brings tears to my eyes. It's... legendary.This is a totally different movie with a totally different premise, so no, it's not like The Land Before Time because it's not supposed to be. The only thing that links the two is they both have animated dinosaurs that talk. This movie takes you on a fantastic ride through the wishes of children. This movie is all about seeing childhood wishes come true. And being so, yes, it's ridiculous and a bit beyond the realm of reason, but hey, what childhood fantasy IS logical? Good points about the movie The voice acting was wonderful and believable. I absolutely fell in love with Louie's character. He is adorable and the deepest character in the film. I love how he progresses in his character with the help of the dinosaurs (especially Rex) to not only get his wish for a friend but also find there is more to life than being a tough guy because the original tough guy chose the life of love and heart instead of teeth and claws. The sacrifice the dinosaurs made for the children was very heartwarming. Imagine basically giving up your sanity for a friend. Having a mental illness myself I can imagine that as someone forcing me to give up my medicine to save a friend and I can tell you it'd be a tough decision, a terrible one, but I'd do it in a heartbeat. Thinking of it that way, one cannot belittle that moment in the plot by saying this movie doesn't have a lot of heart. The animation was great but I would have preferred they kept the dinosaurs slightly more realistic when they entered the human world. They looked a lot like mushy balloons to me and as an artist and fan of animation I would have loved to see a film with a more realistic and anatomically substantial set of lovable, cuddly dinosaurs. I immensely enjoyed the scene where Rex shows how he started life as a monster. That part of the movie and that alone reminded me of the animation in The Land Before Time. It was excellently pulled off. And the other animation was great too but as I said, it had a saturday morning cartoon sort of feel rather than an animated movie. The dinosaurs were goofy in comparison to the animation given to the humans. And we can't talk about good things without mentioning Professor Screweyes. I love this villain very much. I wish his character had more development and that they had kept the deleted scene explaining his past. There were some issues I had with the parts of the movie with him in it but I'll get to that later. But I will say this, I will never forget the fear I had as a young child watching this villain. It was wonderful. Negative As mentioned earlier the friendly forms the dinosaurs took looked more like the goofy form to me. They could have been friendly and more anatomically correct. I would have loved to see Rex looking more like a friendly version of Sharptooth because I've always found these animals beautiful just the way they are. They took Rex's beauty.Also I do have a bone to pick with Screweyes and the whole premise of him being a villain. Captian Neweyes told the dinosaurs that Sreweyes was insane and evil right from the beginning. As a child I didn't understand Screweyes was a villain because he manipulated the kids and the dinosaurs. The moment I saw him, before he made the children sign the contract, I thought he was a villain just because he dealt with fear and that he scared people. That is the way a lot of people teach their children. Horror is evil. Exploring fear is evil. When it is not. I love horror, good creepypasta, and even write my own. This movie displays anyone who enjoys fear or dresses in a darker more alternative style as evil. Yes I know he IS evil and shows this later in the film but the first thing you get from the movie as proof of his evilness is that he runs a scary circus and prefers horror to comedy. There's nothing wrong with a good scare when it's under control. If he hadn't had his backstory deleted it would have made more sense as to why his scaring people is evil. It shows that he scares and manipulates people to feel in control of fear so that he isn't afraid of things himself. A very selfish reason for doing what he does. Without it he just seems like a horror buff for a while until the real bad things happen. Even Rex as a monster couldn't find a reason to eat the poor guy.Overall I love this movie. It will always be one of my childhood favorites and a great memory. It has heart, fear, childlike wonder, and even a tiny smidge of romance. It is short and yes, Screweyes will be horrifying to younger children but I watched it at 2, got a wonderful scare out of it and turned out fine. Sometimes watching the darker animated films from that time is good for kids. A more realistic take on the world than all the bubbly, happy nonsense our kids watch today. If your kids haven't seen it yet I say give it a try. ","genre":null},{"date":"25 July 2013","score":"","review":" Okay, so as many of you have so eloquently stated, this is no The Land Before Time.

I'm not giving this movie any special treatment for that. I'm reviewing and rating it just like I would rate and review a movie that would come out now. Anyway, there are two types of people in the world people who think 'Alien' is better than 'Aliens', and people who think 'Aliens' is better than 'Alien'. I don't think either of them is better than another. I watched the 1990 special addition of the movie, so it's two and a half hours long.'Aliens' had a very slow first hour of the movie. It worked for only about twenty minutes. The movie then started dragging on for the other forty minutes. In the first twenty minutes, it was alright because the slowness hadn't gotten boring yet, it was just used to introduce new characters and go over the situation at hand. This part of the first hour was enjoyable. As it went on, though, we had already known all of the characters and there was just nothing going on. There was quite a bit of CGI used near the end of the first hour, which I think they could gone without using, because it was two-dimensional CGI. There were also green screens used, which also brought it down. That was part of the reason the forty minute boring part was bad. The other part of the reason is that it was simply unexciting.The acting in this movie had a few problems, too. A few of the actors didn't seem to give it their all. Luckily, the main actors and actresses (Sigourney Weaver, Carrie Henn, and Michael Biehn) did well. I believed those three actors and actresses were their characters. The supposed cast weren't all very good, though.In several scenes of this movie, the characters would have to be quiet to get through places, and there was no music in these parts. This made suspense build up to set up for action sequences. They executed this well in the film. It made trauma for the audience and even some intensity. That worked in the movie. They also didn't just have mindless acting in the movie. Every sequence had a reason for it's happening, which just made it more enjoyable. That brings up the quality of the acting sequences. The acting sequences were great. They had alright music for the situations and had very thrilling humans vs. aliens battle scenes. There were used of guns which brought more explosions that just made it more thrilling. Also, the humans didn't just win every time. There was an equal balance of aliens winning, too. This made the movie more thrilling and intense. It wouldn't have been good if the humans won every time. The technology used in that time period wasn't too far- fetched, either.Overall, this movie was really good. That's what my 8\/10 rating means.

Who hasn't watched this many times over the years? When I was growing up many friends wanted to go on adventures like the kids in this movie.Mikey, Mouth, Chunk, Data and Brand are the Goonies. They find a treasure map and all except Brand think it will lead to something. Something that will save their homes. They have to over come obstacles and booby traps as well as being chased by three dangerous criminals, the Fratellis. They enlist the help of Andy and Stef along the way. Another enlistee is an unlikely ally in Sloth, who is a Fratelli, but is mistreated because he is physically and mentally impaired.The Goonies first encounter the Fratellis at an old restaurant along the coast. The restaurant is the starting point for the treasure map. They decide to wait until the Fratellis leave to explore the restaurant. The Fratellis come back unexpectedly while the Goonies are in the basement. Their only way out is to go through a secret passage in the fireplace. Chunk is left behind because he got trapped in a freezer when they found a dead body. Chunk escapes the basement through a window but is later picked up at the side of the road by... the Fratellis.Meanwhile Mikey, Mouth, Data, Brand, Andy and Stef continue on with the treasure hunt. They come across several booby traps and the remains of a former treasure hunter. They find a key around the neck of Chester Copperpot, the dead treasure hunter, and then set off a booby trap that drops large boulders from high above that are meant to crush intruders.Next the Goonies find a well and they think for a split second that they have found the treasure. Unfortunately all they found was a wishing well. A suitor of Andy's, Troy, happens to toss a coin in the wishing well. The Goonies throw the coin back up and he offers to help them out of the well. Mikey talks the others into continue on the treasure hunt.Back at the restaurant the Fratellis question Chunk. After finding out that the tunnel in the fireplace really exists the Fratellis leave chunk tied up in the same room where Sloth is kept. Chunk and Sloth become friends. Sloth breaks free and helps Chunk to get free. Sloth hears his echo coming from the tunnel in the fire place and follows it, leaving Chunk no choice but to follow.While in the well the Goonies find another booby trap that nearly kills Data, but he saves himself by using his pinchers of Hell. They climb down into another tunnel. Having decided to get a pitstop out of the way Andy decides that it is time to make a move on Brand. Brand sends Mikey to see what Andy wants and ends up getting kissed by Andy. Andy thinks it was Brand that she was kissing.The next obstacle is a log bridge over a raging river. Data is the last to cross and he sprays oil along the log to slow the Fratellis down. It works.The next booby trap the Goonies find is a piano made of bones with a skeleton as the a head piece. Andy has to play the notes on the back of the treasure map in order to help the rest of the Goonies to continue on their quest. If Andy fails to play the correct notes the floor will drop away and they will fall to their deaths. Each correct note opens a door little by little so they can keep going. Andy is able to play the correct notes just in time as the Fratellis are right on their heels.The Goonies escape and come to a water slide type obstacle. The treasure map turns out to be real. The Goonies find the treasure of One Eyed Willie. The Goonies start loading the treasure into their pockets. Mikey empties his marble bag and puts several jewels inside. But before they can gather any treasure and get away from the Fratellis, the Fratellis show up and capture them. Chunk and Sloth catch up to everyone and help the Goonies to escape.As the Goonies and the Fratellis escape the cave that One Eyed Willie's ship is in the cave walls begin to fall in, eventually allowing the ship to set sail again. The police find the Goonies and the Fratellis walking up the beach. The Goonies' parents are called and they all have a joyful reunion. Eventually the jewels are found in Mikey's marble bag and they help to save the homes of the Goonies' families.I was six years old when this movie came out. I loved watching this movie every chance I could. Now that I have it on DVD I can watch it every day if I want to. For a kids movie it's pretty good, even nearly thirty years old. The acting is pretty good for a bunch of child actors, not forced. The action is pretty good; the story was pretty good. A lot of comedy; a lot of laughs.

Chunk escapes the basement through a window but is later picked up at the side of the road by... the Fratellis.Meanwhile Mikey, Mouth, Data, Brand, Andy and Stef continue on with the treasure hunt. They come across several booby traps and the remains of a former treasure hunter. They find a key around the neck of Chester Copperpot, the dead treasure hunter, and then set off a booby trap that drops large boulders from high above that are meant to crush intruders.Next the Goonies find a well and they think for a split second that they have found the treasure. Unfortunately all they found was a wishing well. A suitor of Andy's, Troy, happens to toss a coin in the wishing well. The Goonies throw the coin back up and he offers to help them out of the well. Mikey talks the others into continue on the treasure hunt.Back at the restaurant the Fratellis question Chunk. After finding out that the tunnel in the fireplace really exists the Fratellis leave chunk tied up in the same room where Sloth is kept. Chunk and Sloth become friends. Sloth breaks free and helps Chunk to get free. Sloth hears his echo coming from the tunnel in the fire place and follows it, leaving Chunk no choice but to follow.While in the well the Goonies find another booby trap that nearly kills Data, but he saves himself by using his pinchers of Hell. They climb down into another tunnel. Having decided to get a pitstop out of the way Andy decides that it is time to make a move on Brand. Brand sends Mikey to see what Andy wants and ends up getting kissed by Andy. Andy thinks it was Brand that she was kissing.The next obstacle is a log bridge over a raging river. Data is the last to cross and he sprays oil along the log to slow the Fratellis down. It works.The next booby trap the Goonies find is a piano made of bones with a skeleton as the a head piece. Andy has to play the notes on the back of the treasure map in order to help the rest of the Goonies to continue on their quest. If Andy fails to play the correct notes the floor will drop away and they will fall to their deaths. Each correct note opens a door little by little so they can keep going. Andy is able to play the correct notes just in time as the Fratellis are right on their heels.The Goonies escape and come to a water slide type obstacle. The treasure map turns out to be real. The Goonies find the treasure of One Eyed Willie. The Goonies start loading the treasure into their pockets. Mikey empties his marble bag and puts several jewels inside. But before they can gather any treasure and get away from the Fratellis, the Fratellis show up and capture them. Chunk and Sloth catch up to everyone and help the Goonies to escape.As the Goonies and the Fratellis escape the cave that One Eyed Willie's ship is in the cave walls begin to fall in, eventually allowing the ship to set sail again. The police find the Goonies and the Fratellis walking up the beach. The Goonies' parents are called and they all have a joyful reunion. Eventually the jewels are found in Mikey's marble bag and they help to save the homes of the Goonies' families.I was six years old when this movie came out. I loved watching this movie every chance I could. Now that I have it on DVD I can watch it every day if I want to. For a kids movie it's pretty good, even nearly thirty years old. The acting is pretty good for a bunch of child actors, not forced. The action is pretty good; the story was pretty good. A lot of comedy; a lot of laughs.

Who hasn't watched this many times over the years? When I was growing up many friends wanted to go on adventures like the kids in this movie.Mikey, Mouth, Chunk, Data and Brand are the Goonies. They find a treasure map and all except Brand think it will lead to something. Something that will save their homes. They have to over come obstacles and booby traps as well as being chased by three dangerous criminals, the Fratellis. They enlist the help of Andy and Stef along the way. Another enlistee is an unlikely ally in Sloth, who is a Fratelli, but is mistreated because he is physically and mentally impaired.The Goonies first encounter the Fratellis at an old restaurant along the coast. The restaurant is the starting point for the treasure map. They decide to wait until the Fratellis leave to explore the restaurant. The Fratellis come back unexpectedly while the Goonies are in the basement. Their only way out is to go through a secret passage in the fireplace.

They feature EXTREMELY interesting characters--folks who are very, very unique but strange. As far as the plots in many of these films go, they really seem unimportant--like the film is more a platform for a character study than a traditional film plot. This is not necessarily a criticism--more an observation. And, if you don't mind these sort of meandering films, then by all means see Rushmore.Rushmore is a character study of an ultra-bizarre high school student who is probably nothing like any living person. Jason Schwartzman plays Max--a seriously strange guy who is impossible to adequately describe or classify--though he is really creepy and becomes a stalker. He is super-involved with a zillion school activities and clubs which he started, yet his grades are abominable. He seems like a nice kid at times, but later seems emotionally disturbed and potentially dangerous. He's also thoughtful and nice and yet incredibly thoughtless and a jerk. Do these combinations make sense? The same could be said, to a lesser degree for the other characters--as they often behave inconsistently and are confusing.So did I like the film? Well, parts of the film were good and I enjoyed them. But the plot just left me very, very cold--as did the extremely deadpan performances (something typical of an Anderson film). My advice is to first see an Anderson film with a more traditional style and plot. While Moonrise Kingdom certainly isn't conventional, compared to all his other films, it really is! Try it and if you like it, then try The Royal Tenenbaums and THEN Rushmore. And, if you are really a fan, by all means try Bottle Rocket and the rest. But start slowly...your brain will thank you for this!
