The film notably comes from Disney, which is surprising when you think about it because of how dialogue driven and character driven the film really is. It is impressive how well the film still holds up to this day and that it manages to remain constantly interesting despite little action. The film is still somewhat under-appreciated, whether that is because of Disney's title is unsure because the film still grips and entertains with ease.The story sees the oceans assumed unsafe during the late 1800s as a number of ships have been destroyed by what people are calling a monster. A naturalist professor, his assistant and a whaler join an expedition to unravel the mystery. But when they're vessel is destroyed and they are the only three who survive, the come aboard the 'monster' and realise it is a high-tech submarine run by the highly intelligent Captain Nemo. Nemo is distant to them at first, but slowly allows them to into his ideology. The story is very interesting, the mystery of Nemo's views on life are presented and left for the audience to make judgement on. I really like how the film portrays the four ideologies of these men and lets their views on warfare bounce around, as this is what forms the plots backbone. The film is very story driven so that fact that the plot is this good really helps make the film standout.The four lead actors are what really make the film memorable. All four create engaging people and get their personality traits down perfectly. James Mason is simply superb as the complex and tragic Nemo. He displays Nemo as a man that was far ahead of his time and wounded by how harmful man's actions can be. The fact that he has retired to the sea shows how much he wants to get away from the actions of his fellow humans. Paul Lukas is equally as brilliant in his very calming and touching portrayal of Professor Aronnax. He is one of a few who believes that he can convince Nemo to change his views on humanity and see that there is some good left. Both Mason and Lukas give wonderfully intelligent performances.Kirk Douglas puts his gruff persona and chiselled looks to good use as the vigorous everyday sailor Ned Land. Land's more bombastic attitude and hands on approach brilliantly corresponds those of Nemo and the professor. Peter Lorre is also excellent support as the professor's easily panicked assistant Conseil. Lorre's agitated expressions and nervous delivery are just perfect for the character, as Lorre makes what could have been a forgotten role extremely notable.It is striking at just how well the film holds up and how the visual aspects have hardly dated thanks to expert techniques used. The claustrophobic nature of the Nautilus is the perfect metaphor for how trapped the three men feel at first, whilst the submarine itself is a stunning creation thanks to its Gothic design and colourful scenery. The scenes filmed out at sea and under the oceans waves look very authentic, even the use of blue screen is difficult to notice at times. When the action set pieces do turn up they are very well shot and full of tension. The famous giant squid attack looks very good, thanks to shooting the scene in a storm, and has a lot of excitement. The scene were Ned enters the natives land is also very good thanks to the excellently crafted suspense, you can even forgive the dodgy electricity effects.The dialogue and interactions are another highlight. This is an extremely character driven film after all, the main thing that the film does is to try and have the views of the four leads bounce of each other in order to place them in an interesting dilemma. The three men have difficulty accepting Nemo's views and have trouble working out reasons for his motives. While Ned and Conseil dismiss him as a madman, the professor notes that Nemo does have his reasons as him becomes a confident for the captain. Nemo turns into more of a tragic character as we learn his true motives and this creates a great anti-hero for the audience to decide to agree with or turn away. The more that the professor gets sucked into Nemo's ideology creates the perfect conflict as Ned and Conseil cannot decide what action to take.As said the dialogue is brilliant. I really like how smart it is and how the conversations of the men are always interesting. It also allows us to see through the characters eyes and find out what they are feeling, like with the professor's journal. There are some funny quips such as Lorre claiming that messages in bottles when out with Robinson Crusoe that are well placed throughout. The score from Paul Smith fits in soundly as well. It does sound rather grand and manages to convey the elements of suspense very well. Even Kirk Douglas tune 'Whale of a Tale' is a very enjoyable number.20,000 Leagues might very well be one of the best adventure movies ever made, it is certainly one of Disney's best live action pieces. For such a reserved and dialogue driven film it is amazing how interesting and entertaining it manages to be. That in part is down to the four lead actors who, as said, are all absolutely fantastic jobs. It is also in part to an excellent script and some truly outstanding production design that also help to make the film a masterpiece. 20,000 Leagues is always entertaining, filled with interesting ideas, superb acting and wonderful visuals it is impossible not to find something to enjoy.

I was at home sketching Debra Jo Fondren off the cover of Playboy magazine onto a sheet of Newsprint and found I could draw much better thereafter and with more satisfaction and enjoyment. This was a kind of deliverance to me. Idly dropping off the Livernois bus to visit Doctor Curtis' Museum of Black History while unemployed and having time on my hands, I discovered, much to my astonishment, and contrary to what was to be seen on The Science Channel and 'Through The Wormhole', that Black Folks invented as much new technology and made things better for the future as much as anyone else. Besides that, you could trace their accomplishments back through time thousands upon thousands of years.On top of that, a voice came out of nowhere one day and asked me what my Top Ten Favorite movies of all time were and to list them. I did what the voice bid me to do. At that time the voice asked me what was the common denominator to all these films that I liked so much. This took me a considerable amount of thought before I could formulate a reasonable answer.When the answer dawned upon me, I marveled at my discovery. The films that I treasured the most in my hearts of hearts despite their subject matter all contained the least amount or no Sex and Violence at all in them! I went over the list again and again, thinking this couldn't possibly be the case for such a random selection of films.But, for me, it was true.It was from this that I was able to formulate my hard and fast rule about storytelling.Sex and Violence are substitutes for Character and Plot development.That brings us to THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT. There is no romantic relationship or love triangle between the female lead Heather Donahue or the other male characters. There are no scenes of physical conflict between any of the leads. Therefore, a very interesting question comes to mind.How could a film made for twentynine thousand dollars plus thirty thousand dollars for promotion costs with no apparent Sex and Violence to embroider its narrative yet go on to gross over a hundred and forty million dollars worldwide? Could it be the focus of the film is on storytelling? This is a great film for Independent Filmmakers to study and treasure. THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT, according to my lights, is the film that truly and substantially changed the landscape of Cinema. The simplicity of the idea, the method acting techniques used to prepare the actors to improvise their lines and reactions with sophomoric verisimilitude and sincerity in carefully crafted and yet somewhat open ended situations suggests anyone could have made this film.Even you.Sure why not? Anyone could pack their gear and cameras for two or three days of hiking to some place nearby like Seneca Creek State Park to investigate the local Bogeyman legend that's supposed to have happened in the woods somewhere out there. Just take a map and mark your destination so that you don't end up off the beaten track or right back where you started and make a careful record of any suspicious items or objects found on your journey. Hopefully, curiosity won't lead you screaming and running through the woods in the dark fleeing from mysterious sounds in the night. God forbid that all the footage you shoot should end up among the found objects involved with The Blair Witch Legend; that you should end up missing and never heard from again.What a bummer, huh?

But, when it was time to review Blue Velvet on his television program, Siskel and Ebert at the Movies, he gave an scathing review to an film that I think deserved more credit for its style and way of vision. His partner, Gene Siskel, gave the film an highly positive review. He even went further to put Blue Velvet on his top 10 Best Films of 1986. To me, I think Mr. Ebert should've understand Blue Velvet a whole lot more clearer. I'm not saying that he has a poor taste in film. I'm just saying that some of our most promising film critics can be harsh on great movies. Blue Velvet is an strange, disturbing and very stylized film that has a twist to it. In the beginning of the movie, we are introduced by Jeffery Beaumont (Kyle MacLachlan), who is returning to his hometown of Lumberton from Oak Lake College. Jeffery's father has just suffered a stroke when watering the grass. So, now Jeffery is back in a familiar place, all right. Except for something else. When Jeffery is walking through an field of grass, he comes across an severed ear in the grass. Now, who put it there? Who cut off the ear? The answer is We don't know. Jeffery reports to the police station to show Detective Williams (George Dickerson). He even begins an friendly relationship with Williams' daughter, Sandy, (Laura Dern). Sandy suspects that the woman who lives in an apartment in the town is acting strange. When Jeffery questions her, she doesn't seem to know. She advises Jeffery to sneak into the woman's apartment and hides in her closet. The woman is an nightclub singer named Dorothy Vallens (Isabella Rossellini). Furthermore, Jeffery learns that Vallens' husband is kidnapped and held up by her brutal and foul-mouthed captor named Frank Booth (Dennis Hopper). Booth is brutal. He'll do anything to Vallens' Torture her, perform strange sex acts with her and even degrade her in front of public. Soon enough, Jeffery finds himself in a world where nothing is what it seems. The opening sequences of Blue Velvet are shot very beautifully. We see basically, a suburban landscape. White picket fences, Red roses, Friendly firemen waving to you, giving you an gleefully smile as they ride by, and even friendly neighbors that won't even bother you. The director, David Lynch, combines this tale with sharp story-telling skills. He begins this story with an inside look of Smalltown U.S.A. It's the kind of town that you would want to move into. But, as we learn about Lumberton, we then see a dramatic change. We learned that this particular town has some very nasty people living there. There's a sense of evil that is lurking in this town. We don't where it's coming from. But, we get an sense of what's happening here. The second thing that Lynch also brings up is the voyeurism in all of us. In that scene where Jeffery hides in Dorothy Vallens' closet, we get an sense of voyeurism, just like how Alfred Hitchcock presented voyeurism in Psycho. This time, Lynch really empathizes on small-town problems that are severely strange. It's strange to us why these problems don't occur out in public. As Jeffery digs deeper into his investigation, he soon realizes that this town also has an underworld to it, filled with very strange and bizarre characters, especially Frank. The thing that Frank represents, I think, is the sexual oppression of America. In other words, he is simply aroused by doing things that are unusual, but it's granted in his own mind. He gets aroused by inhaling amyl nitrite into his system, making him have spouts of rage toward Vallens. Vallens, however, enjoys being abused by Frank, but we don't know why she enjoys it. There are a lot of things that Blue Velvet stands for, instead of just being an title song, being sung by Bobby Vinton. I think it shows that even small towns can have an underworld too. Cities do have underworlds, too. But, small towns can have one, too. Blue Velvet is brilliant. It has a lot of power being put into the savage violence that Hopper's character possess. Not only by violence, but by the atmosphere that surrounds the movie itself. It's suffocating and relentless, but vivid. Lynch's direction is crisp and creates an dark atmosphere to his vision of a strange world being buried underneath an small town. Dennis Hopper is very convincing as Frank. He is one of the reasons why this movie works. We basically sit back and watch Hopper be angry at his victim. Hopper did received an Golden Globe nomination for his performance. But, I think he should've gotten an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor as well. He is that great in the movie. The story telling is haunting and is well told. When the 1980's drew to a close, Blue Velvet was as being one of the top 10 best films of the decade. It definitely deserves it. The film gained cult status over the years, and even after 28 years, it still holds up. It's a Strange World, Isn't It? Yes, it is. ★★★★ 4 stars.

Jeffery's father has just suffered a stroke when watering the grass. So, now Jeffery is back in a familiar place, all right. Except for something else. When Jeffery is walking through an field of grass, he comes across an severed ear in the grass. Now, who put it there? Who cut off the ear? The answer is We don't know. Jeffery reports to the police station to show Detective Williams (George Dickerson). He even begins an friendly relationship with Williams' daughter, Sandy, (Laura Dern). Sandy suspects that the woman who lives in an apartment in the town is acting strange. When Jeffery questions her, she doesn't seem to know. She advises Jeffery to sneak into the woman's apartment and hides in her closet. The woman is an nightclub singer named Dorothy Vallens (Isabella Rossellini). Furthermore, Jeffery learns that Vallens' husband is kidnapped and held up by her brutal and foul-mouthed captor named Frank Booth (Dennis Hopper). Booth is brutal. He'll do anything to Vallens' Torture her, perform strange sex acts with her and even degrade her in front of public. Soon enough, Jeffery finds himself in a world where nothing is what it seems. The opening sequences of Blue Velvet are shot very beautifully. We see basically, a suburban landscape. White picket fences, Red roses, Friendly firemen waving to you, giving you an gleefully smile as they ride by, and even friendly neighbors that won't even bother you. The director, David Lynch, combines this tale with sharp story-telling skills. He begins this story with an inside look of Smalltown U.S.A. It's the kind of town that you would want to move into. But, as we learn about Lumberton, we then see a dramatic change. We learned that this particular town has some very nasty people living there. There's a sense of evil that is lurking in this town. We don't where it's coming from. But, we get an sense of what's happening here. The second thing that Lynch also brings up is the voyeurism in all of us. In that scene where Jeffery hides in Dorothy Vallens' closet, we get an sense of voyeurism, just like how Alfred Hitchcock presented voyeurism in Psycho. This time, Lynch really empathizes on small-town problems that are severely strange. It's strange to us why these problems don't occur out in public. As Jeffery digs deeper into his investigation, he soon realizes that this town also has an underworld to it, filled with very strange and bizarre characters, especially Frank. The thing that Frank represents, I think, is the sexual oppression of America. In other words, he is simply aroused by doing things that are unusual, but it's granted in his own mind. He gets aroused by inhaling amyl nitrite into his system, making him have spouts of rage toward Vallens. Vallens, however, enjoys being abused by Frank, but we don't know why she enjoys it. There are a lot of things that Blue Velvet stands for, instead of just being an title song, being sung by Bobby Vinton. I think it shows that even small towns can have an underworld too. Cities do have underworlds, too. But, small towns can have one, too. Blue Velvet is brilliant. It has a lot of power being put into the savage violence that Hopper's character possess. Not only by violence, but by the atmosphere that surrounds the movie itself. It's suffocating and relentless, but vivid. Lynch's direction is crisp and creates an dark atmosphere to his vision of a strange world being buried underneath an small town. Dennis Hopper is very convincing as Frank. He is one of the reasons why this movie works. We basically sit back and watch Hopper be angry at his victim. Hopper did received an Golden Globe nomination for his performance. But, I think he should've gotten an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor as well. He is that great in the movie. The story telling is haunting and is well told. When the 1980's drew to a close, Blue Velvet was as being one of the top 10 best films of the decade. It definitely deserves it. The film gained cult status over the years, and even after 28 years, it still holds up. It's a Strange World, Isn't It? Yes, it is. ★★★★ 4 stars.

But, when it was time to review Blue Velvet on his television program, Siskel and Ebert at the Movies, he gave an scathing review to an film that I think deserved more credit for its style and way of vision. His partner, Gene Siskel, gave the film an highly positive review. He even went further to put Blue Velvet on his top 10 Best Films of 1986. To me, I think Mr. Ebert should've understand Blue Velvet a whole lot more clearer. I'm not saying that he has a poor taste in film.

Over the past few weeks, I have been studying the history of the American coal mining industry. It has not been pleasant taking it all in. I recently watched a documentary Called Harlan County USA, which covered the miners strike in the 1970's. I learned from that there was more to learn about the strike in the that occurred 1920's in Matewan, West Virginia. Fortunately I found this movie, Matewan and watched it. It is hard to imagine this kind of of corporate brutality being tolerated today. The acting is first rate and the screenplay is excellent. This movie looks gritty and believable. The main character, Joe Kenehan (Chris Cooper) is a pacifist union man sent to Matewan to try to organize the workers to form a union to fight for better conditions. He finds the workers and their families are divided and cautious on the idea. To try to quell the issue, the mining company sends two heavies in to intimidate all those concerned. The two heavies, Hickey (Kevin Tighe)and Griggs (Gordon Clapp), would have to be the most vindictive characters that I have ever seen on screen. They make your skin crawl. The events that play out until the final confrontation, are tense and realistically done. This is not a feel good movie, but it is a very important dramatization of a time and place that should never be forgotten. A must see movie.

It tells the story of two detectives - one ready to retire, the other at the start of his career - and their attempts to capture a perverted serial killer who is using the Seven Deadly Sins as his scenario.The look of Seven is crucial to its effect. This is a very dark film, the gloom often penetrated only by the flashlights of the detectives. Even when all the lights are turned on in the apartments of the victims, they cast only wan, hopeless pools of light.The enigma of Somerset's character is at the heart of the film, and this is one of Morgan Freeman's best performances. He embodies authority naturally; I can't recall him ever playing a weak man. Here he knows all the lessons a cop might internalize during years spent in what we learn is one of the worst districts of the city. He lives alone, in what looks like a rented apartment, bookshelves on the walls. He puts himself to sleep with a metronome. He never married, although he came close once. He is a lonely man who confronts life with resigned detachment.Seven is not really a very deep or profound film, but it provides the convincing illusion of one. Almost all mainstream thrillers seek first to provide entertainment; this one intends to fascinate and appall. The killer obviously intends his elaborate murders as moral statement. He suggests as much after we meet him. When he's told his crimes will soon be forgotten in the daily rush of cruelty, he insists they will be remembered forever. They are his masterpiece. What goes unexplained is how, exactly, he is making a statement. His victims, presumably guilty of their sins, have been convicted and executed by his actions. What's the lesson? Let that be a warning to us?The killer, as I said, turns himself in with 30 minutes to go, and dominates the film from that point forward. When Seven was released in 1995 the ads, posters and opening credits didn't mention the name of the actor, and although you may well know it, I don't think I will either. This actor has a big assignment. He embodies Evil. Like Hannibal Lecter, his character must be played by a strong actor who projects not merely villainy but twisted psychological complexities. Observe his face. Smug. Self-satisfied. Listen to his voice. Intelligent. Analytical. Mark his composure and apparent fearlessness. The film essentially depends on him, and would go astray if the actor faltered. He doesn't.Seven is unique in one detail of its construction; it brings the killer on screen with half an hour to go, and gives him a speaking role. Instead of being simply the quarry in a chase, he is revealed as a twisted but articulate antagonist, who has devised a horrible plan for concluding his sermon. (The actor playing the killer is not identified by name in the ads or opening credits, and so I will leave his identity as another of his surprises.) Seven is well-made in its details, and uncompromising in the way it presents the disturbing details of the crimes. It is certainly not for the young or the sensitive.

He secretly swaps another from a woman who died in birth. Unfortunately for him, this child is the spawn of Satan.This was the third in the big three satanic themed horror movies released by the Hollywood studios; The Omen falls somewhere between the other two, Rosemary's Baby and The Exorcist. It doesn't have the subtlety of the former but is a lot more restrained than the latter. It's probably the most obviously mainstream of the three, although in fairness all three were smash hits at the box office. They all share the scary idea of the ultimate evil being channelled through the vessel of a child. This one, alongside Rosemary's Baby, is more specifically about the birth of the Antichrist but where Rosemary's Baby ends with the birth of the child, The Omen begins with this event. In doing so, we focus our attention on the impact of the child as opposed to the mother's pregnancy as we did in Roman Polanski's film. This change basically opens the door for a less restrained film, with the depiction of a variety of violent supernatural events that follows in the wake of the Antichrist on Earth. In this sense, it's a film where inventive macabre set-pieces play an important role. In particular, the death scenes stay firmly in the mind. We have a particularly haunting scene where the boy's first nanny hangs herself in front of the guests at a large garden party, later on there are a couple of elaborate death scenes where a man is impaled by a falling church spire during a storm and another where a photographer is decapitated by a sheet of glass. These latter two sequences typify the kind of inventively violent deaths that would make up the large part of the subsequent sequels. In this first instalment they are integrated into a plot with a greater emphasis on story development. A lot of the focus is on the boy's 'father' and his initial reluctance to believe the truth and his subsequent return to Italy to discover the horrific facts behind Damien's birth. This results in some interesting, sinister moments such as the scene in the ancient Etruscan graveyard where the body of the boy's mother is found. So The Omen is a good mix of the atmospheric and violent horror strands.The high production values in this one are fairly obvious. There's location shooting in Italy, Britain and Israel. A cast led by the A-Lister Gregory Peck and with fine support work from several others including ex Doctor Who actor Patrick Troughton as a troubled priest, David Warner as a photographer whose pictures reveal strange and ominous hidden supernatural imagery and, best of all, Billie Whitelaw as the very sinister nanny Mrs Baylock. Additionally, child actor Harvey Stephens is suitably creepy as young Damien. While it would be seriously remiss to not mention composer Jerry Goldsmith's sterling contribution, seeing as his score is one of the best things about the movie - its sinister choirs all the way in a very dramatic soundtrack. The focused direction from Richard Donner holds everything together resulting in a very solid film indeed.

Genuinely moving with a voice-over to die for. The narration takes you on a journey of epic storytelling, whilst still moving you to tears. Morgan Freeman delivers the most powerful performance, I think, of his career as the very likable Red, while the then unknown to me, Tim Robbins delivers a poignant performance of an ill justified innocent who gets caught up in a web of in-prison politics and corruption. The schemes of Tim's character, Andy Dufresne with his wizardry with the abacus and knowledge of the tax system befriends the prisoners and the officers and the smug look on his face is to die for when he get his inmates a bottle of beer each to drink in the sunshine.

Jean Reno and Robert De Niro are a great duo and both show their superior acting, their chemistry as comrades in arms is brilliant and compelling, and believable. Reno is charming. I like that it's not Americanised, there is a lot of French (subtitled) and as such it won't appeal to many but the international feel of it is something I like.It has many memorable scenes, and incredible action and car chases, and I love De Niro's scene removing the bullet... and the whole Ronin monologue. It's incredibly real, but also managed to be a little humorous - if you don't mind, I'm going to pass out is one of the immortal lines of the film. Natascha McElhone as the handler is good and grim but her accent sometimes fades in and out, but not as bad as Jonathan Pryce's but the acting was mainly okay. Stellan Skarsgard, another of the 'Ronin' was also good, Sean Bean putting in a rather strange performance (suitable for the role) but De Niro and Reno stood out by a mile. There were some hammy performances and on watching it on repeated occasions there are flaws, but the film stands up to multiple viewings and hasn't aged badly. It was great in the cinema - the car chases on a big screen were quite ground-breaking at the time with some jaw-dropping stunt driving; some of the hand-break turns were some of the best driving I've ever seen on film. Very tense but the main chase scene does go on a bit, and I concede that it might have been filmed and then sped up... I don't know. Still brilliant! The irony of this film is that few of the characters were actually masterless warriors, as the title suggests, or at least weren't fighting for honour. It is an intriguing film, with depth, and intelligence, rather than just a shoot-em-up for the sake of it. It's a really pleasing action film, which cleverly doesn't stretch plausibility. Overall a great film, very enjoyable and a must see for Reno and De Niro fans. I like this film so much that I don't mind that it suggests that it was the Americans who brought about peace in Northern Ireland and solved all the conflict there. The Director (brilliant, though) Frankenheimer is American after all!
