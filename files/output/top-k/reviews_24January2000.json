The thing that pisses me off is Hasbro's lame attempt on making a Transformer movie.  Dont get me wrong it was great.  However, the record needs to be set strait.  AFter watching the movie a thousand times, evaluating it, memorizing it.  I have come up with some conclusions.  One everyone thinks the animation is great. Well I disagree, some of the cells are beautiful but alot are not.  Just watch the movie, espcially the Optimus\/Megatron fight.  In one cell Megatron is done with amazing detail and in the next shot i thought i was watching the old t.v. show.  Surely they could have spent more time fixing that garbage but they had a deadline.  My theory suggests that the movie had to come out right before the toy and since the toy was more important, time on the movie was sacraficed.  Two, it was a commercial, i mean Optimus gets like no air time whatsoever he's there he's dead.  I mean sure the screenwriter had to do it that way.  By plot point 2 the main character needs to be established and how can Hot Rod be the main character with Optimus around.  But, if Hasbro hadnt used it as a commercial, i bet Optimus would have made it to the end.  Or at least made more than a cameo death. Heck they brought him back anyway.  3rd, the ease of the old characters death, then after they are destroyed the new characters are practically invincible...what a plot hole, certainly Optimus could have done a better job than Hot Rod anyday, but unfortunately he just gets smacked around like he was a loser for all those years.  And then when Ultra Magnus eats it, the screen writer just has him brought back like he wasnt even scratched, I mean if it was just that easy to fix somebody they should have brought everybody back and finished this war a long time ago.  Another seriously idiotic excuse for keeping the new line of toys intact, if they were going to bring him back like that they shouldnt have killed the man in the first place. Concerning Hasbro, the bottom line is this.  They did well with the toys but they should have let the professionals handle the movie.  I mean the shadow they cast over the movie only hurt it.  Now after i have pretty much made Hasbro look like amature film makers, let me talk about what made it a good movie.  First was the realism, death...destruction, finally an animated movie with a attitude.  If Disney moives were bad like this i would watch them everday.  Vince Dicola busted some serious instrumentals and even though the songs were a tad corny they were loaded with inspiring motivation, but of course Hasbro didnt make the music, no wonder it was good.  The new characters were actually preatty darn cool.  They stood out against each other and each had their own syle.  The one-liners were great, which i might add was the one thing i thought the screen writer did well with.Alot of people think that transformer fans are dying off.  I disagree. i think that everyone who liked transformers has a place in their heart for them, but Hasbro continues to make that place harder and harder to find. They are a toy company but i feel they have too much leverage over the media portion of trasformers.  I think a Prequel dating before the original show should be made.  I think this seqel should be void of any Hasbro influence and should be made with more violence, drama, and geared more toward adults than even the first one.  I say this for the simple fact that trasformers was too popular to just die as easy as it did.  it was like right after the movie came out, trasformers deteriorated, not because we all grew up but because Hasbro kept it a kids program.  Trasformers in their nature were a violent lifelike creation.  I mean Hasbro bought them from someone in Japan who are known for violent cartoons.  If transformers came back to the big screen violent and bad ass, poeple would go see it. Adults would take their kids to show them what daddy used to watch.  And moral groups would hate the movie and we would all laugh at them as we got our money's worth. Unfortunatley however, if the first one hadnt bombed...All Hasbro's fault...A sequel would have already been made.  Many have tried to offer a script but no one will buy it.

It takes place in a race-track and the murder of a horse is included (that's where the title came from).  Johnny finds all the men he needs and explains them how the robbery will go down.  So he has one man to shoot the horse from a parking lot.  He has another man to pick up the money once it was robbed, one man to create a diversion in the race-track, one man to open him the door to the money and finally, himself to rob the money and the man upstairs to hope everything goes the way it was planned.

It is a documentary that opens your eyes so much of what Kurt had to go through, and how he reached the top only to lose it all. I had suspicions about his death, whether it was suicide or not. This film brings to light the facts that do raise questions about his suicide, and some sources were good while others were a joke. I still just flat out do not know after watching the movie if he was murdered. The most powerful part of this is how Courtney Love's true colors shine through. She, at her own fault by refusing interviews and information, is seen as a venomous, instable, manipulating, bitch. And in my opinion SHE IS. Like the nanny stated in the film, if she didnt have something do with the murder of Kurt, then she drove him to murder himself. Excellent style by director, interviewer Nick Broomfield. A must see for every Nirvana fan (and Hole\/ Courtney Love  fan for that matter)!!

Not knowing much about the plot of the film other than that it was to deal with warriors in battle with eaters of the dead, I found myself absorbed in it within half an hour.  In the tradition of films such as Conan the Barbarian and Excalibur, this film has as much sword wielding to be worthy of such films.  There are a few scenes in the film which are left unanswered, but it doesn't take away from the overall effect of the film.  The Nordic warriors had a very rugged and original look, as well as the misty landscape which makes the movie visually scenic.  Antonio Banderas character as the sole Arabian and 13th Warrior gives the film a different and fresh perspective than if it were all 13 Nordic warriors.  The plot is not intristic but it is good enough to keep the film flowing.  If your one of those who value plot more than anything watch The Usual Suspects, but if your looking for a decent plot with substantial fight scenes that keep you glued to your chair, this is a very entertaining movie.

I know that this point of view puts me into the category of old fogy, but so it goes.

How the characters just seemed to accept raining toads as natural phenomenon was just a moving and masterful touch!In summary, a little less time to set up characters, a better musical score, and just a bit more focus on bringing out the emotions in the audience would have made this one of the most excellent movies ever made.The great achievement of this movie is that, although it may not get you to feel much, but it will definitely get you thinking, about opening and cleaning your own closet!!!

Yes he had all the glorious menacing presance we had hoped for, but he hardly appeared in the film, the role of head bad 'guy' being given to the entirely unconvincing and unimmpressive Sophie Marcau. Denise Richards made a suitably beautiful Bond girl, but her role in the film was unclear. After the escape from the missile silo, she had no reason to tag along with Bond, in fact her presence was absurd as 007 is supposed to be a top secret agent. And OK, the romance in Bond films is rarely convincing, but this one just seemed to spring from nowhere, just to have the out of place Roger Moore style ending. The action sequences were uninspiring, with the obvious exception of the blistering pre-credits scenes. Bonds car seemed to be made of wood and the climatic battle was hardly on the scale of the best Bond films, not even that of recent Bond films. The locations used were also rather dull and uninteresting, again with the exception of the Greenwich scenes. We've seen the world through Bond films a thousand times, and I think it's about time we brought him home and saw some more scenes in good old Blighty for a change. And I DON'T mean that ridiculous picture postcard Scotland that belongs in a crass Hollywood production rather than British venture such as Bond. The real shame is that there were some great elements. The boat chase and Carlyle's bad guy have already been mentioned, but putting M in the field was also a very successful idea, as was the return of Robbie Coltrane. Goldie was great as the sniveling henchman and it was good to see so many black actors appearing in major roles. Finally, the sad departure of the late Desmond Llewellyn was well handled and Brosnan is still acting a great 007. Nonetheless, after all that waiting, I can't help thinking that this film could have been so much better.

","genre":"Action, Adventure, Thriller"},{"date":"24 January 2000","score":"","review":"  The highest praise I can give this movie is that I rate it alongside the original trilogy.  It was with some trepidation that I entered the cinema, having heard how awful the film was from many learned sources.  However, criticism was rather harsh to say the least.  Jar Jar was mildly irritating yes, some dialogue was stilted and there could have been more emotional resonance at the film's climax.However, this is far outweighed by the positive aspects.  The end is probably my favourite scene from any movie - absolute excitement and amazing choreography.  Visuals throughout were, of course, stunning.  The Star Wars mythology was enhanced and threads were lain for future episodes.  As for all this whining about how it's so boring to build a plot around tax\/trading etc, surely this doesn't matter -it still boils down to good vs evil.  The three leads were all convincing for me and I look forward to Ewan McGregor taking a more prominent role next time.  A special shout for Pernilla August, who I thought was brilliant as Anakin's mother.In summary, those who appreciated the ethos of the original trilogy will not fail to be moved by the expansion of the Star Wars universe in a technically brilliant and piece of film-making.
