I even read someone saying it was just as good as the original. Pah what nonsense don't believe them I've watched every Halloween and clearly unlike some people knows what makes at the very least a good horror movie and this shower of S is one of the Worst horror movies i have ever seen in my life. Frankly if i was John Carpenter i would sue the person who wrote this either that or go around to his or her place with a hunting rifle. Seriously Halloween sequels in general are nearly all rubbish, two was crap, three was stupid, four is alright, five is well five, H20 alright, Resurrection painful. Yet, in many ways i find this to be the worst of a very bad bunch of sequels. Why? Well let me just embark on some kind of rant not so much a review but a mindless rant on why Halloween 6 the Cure of Michael Myers is one of the most abysmal movies i have seen in a very long time. OK where should i start, ah yes the plot oh boy the plot. Basically the plot is a heaped together mess containing cults, signs of Thor and some other crap. It's just stupid it really is, the film tries to be flashy and intelligent yet, its heaped together in such a horribly made way. Why does Michael Myers got to have a reason for killing people? Simple enough explanation Micahel likes to kill his relatives that would suffice, but no we have to have a man in black and mysterious cults and signs of Thor and utter crap. God its so bad it made me want to cry it really did, the writers have tried to add to the character of Myers but have actually managed to do the entire opposite. Apart from wearing a mask and a boiler suit < which is a completely different colour by the way, Myers just isn't the same guy from the original or even two, heck maybe even four. Thats another thing why has Myers become a Jason Voorhes parody? I thought it was meant to be the other way round, yet Myers is so similar to Jason, all he does is endlessly kill people in gory ways. In the original he teased his victims took his time and as a result the whole thing was far more suspenseful. In this he just walks around hacking people to death. I mean in the space of Half an Hour we had equalled the amount of kills in the original it was just ridiculous. Oh and Myers in this seems to have a really big head, i mean its huge and hes put on loads of weight. What else is crap, oh yeah the return of Tommy Jarvis thats pretty bad, in fact all the characters in this film are crap bar Dr Loomis of course. I can't stand the little kid, i wish he had got it he's really irritating. Our Heroin is boring and not interesting. And her whole family are a terrible bunch of actors. The mother is rubbish, the brother is bad and the Father i mean was this his first part or something? He was like a cartoon villain for gods sake he was actually more evil than Myers < By the way his death is one of the most abysmal i've ever seen i think even Friday the 13th wouldn't come up with something so entirely laughable. What else is rubbish oh yeah Tommy Jarvis, don't know the name of the guy but he really can't act, he tries his best to be serious and all that but i just wanted to laugh at him. I wish he had died in fact if everyone had died it would have been quite good really. There is Dr Loomis a horribly aged and dieing Donald Pleasence by all account. Despite him being on his last legs Pleasance is still the stand out in the brief amount of time he features. Its such a pity that such a corner stone of this franchise had to say farewell in garbage like this. What else is rubbish, oh yeah the bit where the radio DJ gets it. Firstly how the hell did Michael manage to get in that van when five minutes ago he was in his house? Secondly it was just a pointless kill which may boost the body count but is just another peace of nonsense which adds to the drivel that is this film.

But really, this person must be really self-conceited if he thinks that dressing up like a woman will really get him calls from casting agencies. Of course, as a Hollywood story would have it, the plan works but slowly unravels like a cheaply made tapestry. The story is a poorly made fairy tale about how a ridiculous plan always works and when it falls to pieces and the guy gets the girl. But it is not the story itself that makes this movie a winner. It is the actors playing the characters in this guilt-ridden fable.In this story we have Oscar winning actor, Dustin Hoffman playing Michael Dorsey, an out of work actor who is getting no slack from his talent agent played by director, Sydney Pollack. Michael also has his experimental and often quirky roommate played by Bill Murray. There is also Michael's love interest, played by the brilliant Jessica Lange. The story may sound ridiculous but we have the actors that reel in the audience. Dustin Hoffman, a magnificent actor if I do say so myself, I remember when the world really got a taste of him in Kramer vs. Kramer, which got him his first win as best male actor in a lead role. To be honest, anybody could play this role, John Candy could've played a role like this even Jerry Lewis, but none of them could project the charm that Hoffman gives us in this film. Then there is Sydney Pollack, who plays Michael's talent agent. The lines written for the agent were witty and hysterical and who knows how to give witty and hysterical lines better than the director himself? When Pollack said the lines, YOU WERE A TOMATO, I couldn't help it but I had to laugh it up because the delivery by Pollack is just gold. There is also the ravishing Jessica Lange who plays actress Julie Nichols, who is also Michael's love interest in this story. Most Hollywood movies of today cast no-talent blondes with bosoms as big as a man's head to play love interests but this time we have a woman with substance to play the part. A woman who uses words to express herself, not shaking her breasts to receive rave reviews by the male critics, a woman who is smart and articulate to play a role in a movie, a woman named Jessica Lange. Then there is the surprise cast member, Mr. Bill Murray, also known as the Ghostbuster, Carl the grounds keeper and Tripper Harrison. It has been reported that Mr. Murray asked not to have his name mentioned in the trailer or any other advertisements because people would mistake this as one of his comedies. But a man such as myself was rather surprised to see Bill Murray's name in the opening titles and more surprised when I didn't see him eating a Babe Ruth candy bar from out of the pool. The players in the story were an educated pick to make this story a hit, but there were also the writers who gave us the witty dialog.Larry Gelbart, the writer to the hilarious George Burns comedy Oh God!, returns to save a clichéd story with snappy and witty dialog to make the audience laugh. When Bill Murray's character came up and said, I don't like when somebody comes up to me the next day and says, Hey, man, I saw your play. It touched me; I cried. I like it when a guy comes up to me a week later and says, Hey, man, I saw your play... what happened? I thanked the lord himself that Larry Gelbart was here to give this movie the humorous dialog it needed. There was also dialog that was more dramatic and thought provoking, for example this quote from Dustin Hoffman, I don't believe in hell. I believe in UNEMPLOYMENT, but not hell, this line made me think that Gelbart reached into my brain and wrote it down on a piece of paper that happened to be a page to the script of Tootsie.Tootsie, is a story about greed, courage, self-discovery and, what every movie needs, love. Basically, what every movie nowadays already has, very clichéd. Please, by all means, do not see this movie for its story but for great acting done by Dustin Hoffman, Jessica Lange, Sydney Pollack and Bill Murray. But let us not forget where the words coming out of their mouths come from, Larry Gelbart the screen writing genius.

I like it when a guy comes up to me a week later and says, Hey, man, I saw your play... what happened? I thanked the lord himself that Larry Gelbart was here to give this movie the humorous dialog it needed. There was also dialog that was more dramatic and thought provoking, for example this quote from Dustin Hoffman, I don't believe in hell. I believe in UNEMPLOYMENT, but not hell, this line made me think that Gelbart reached into my brain and wrote it down on a piece of paper that happened to be a page to the script of Tootsie.Tootsie, is a story about greed, courage, self-discovery and, what every movie needs, love. Basically, what every movie nowadays already has, very clichéd. Please, by all means, do not see this movie for its story but for great acting done by Dustin Hoffman, Jessica Lange, Sydney Pollack and Bill Murray. But let us not forget where the words coming out of their mouths come from, Larry Gelbart the screen writing genius. So when you go to the theaters to see Tootsie, be ready for a night of entertainment.

I've watched about 20 movies in the last 2 years. Before that, 1 movie per week. I've missed big movies and I'm from somewhere between Generation X and Y.Every actor plays a great role in it. I don't know much of each one past works, but even Julia Roberts seems like she is playing the first role in her career this time. Except she is now 30 and not 20 anymore.It starts showing, quickly, how bad she was in life in that moment. Not one second she gives up, but specially in the beginning, not one second she stops smiling at life even while life throw her away to the dump. That's until she gets of a job interview, broke, with 3 kids, divorced twice and suffer a car accident. Now she can't smile that easily anymore... But, that's one thing in the movie... She doesn't know what's going to happen, but definitely never give up. And that's just the first 7 minutes.The movie has 2 sides. At one side, there is a big case of corruption in PSE&G, the American supplier of gas and electricity. At the other side there is a bright woman, fighting to stay alive and getting life to push her in the hard way into solving that case. And she proves to be able to do the job and still keeping herself as a pretty woman, as she likes that.Along with that, there is, in each part of the movie, smart words being used. It starts pretty fast, then it slows down a little to normal to show details about the story itself. But while it slows down, it still keeps with some details about how's a good way to live life, specially added by Charlie, who seems like an angel, plus the smart way how Erin moves her life, almost unconsciously.--- spoiler --- While watching the movie I've cried, without knowing the reason, for the first time in my short 24 year old life. Other than that, I've only did it in funerals. It was when her child asked what was going on, why she was out of home for 18 months, and they could understand each other by using just a few words. Amazing kid.Despite of how real the story evolving PSE&G really is the movie gives one feeling of evil company. But I rather see it the other image the movie also shows which is PSE&G just acting as a big company who has human making mistakes, blinded by money and by keeping distance from reality.

It also makes the audience wonder what is really going on, which one of the actions takes place in real life, in Donnie's imagination, after traveling through time within God's set path...All the other characters are not that developed as unique individuals, thus the main one is emphasized, but they help to create the plot, contributing with their own story...They are starring in their own more or less important problem\/tragedy, becoming famous for events they didn't want to be part of. I guess some people are just born with tragedy in their lives. Donnie's inside fight between right and wrong, good and evil, reason and insanity, solitude, and the guilt that torments him, they all end within 28 days, 6 hours, 42 minutes and 12 seconds. He doesn't want to be all alone, to die alone..these aspects scare him, because he succumbs to the path of fear after knowing the moment when the world was coming to an end. And he felt -and he actually was- useless, because he couldn't change his destiny, he could only know it, see it and accept his death..The last song from the movie, the one while certain moments of the characters' existence are slide-showed -in the same time Donnie dies-, describes with details their statements, not only at that moment in time and space -past, future or present-, their emotions, their precious memories of their simple, pitiful, insignificant, boring, common and casual lives that get complicated because of their recent brush with mass-destruction...They just want to know what happens when they tear the world apart....

A few drawn out camera shots do NOT a great movie make- even when those shots can be interpreted as deeply symbolic and\/or stand-alone beautiful. And just putting a scene into slow motion doesn't make it great either. That's like putting the pedal down when you play piano just to make it sound ethereal when the same notes by themselves might not be as dramatic.

I love the Star Wars saga, and after initially not liking the sequels have come to love the Matrix Trilogy. I though Flash Gordon was great campy fun, and thought Serenity wasn't bad (but not as good as the Browncoats made it out to be). However, I just can't understand, after watching the film yesterday and today, why people I know love this film. I got a 130min cut free with The Observer newspaper, but I doubt I could stand any extended versions.Now, the film isn't a disaster. David Lynch is not a hack, and there are some great shots and surreal visions. People might think I didn't like the film because of the special effects, but I thought they were quite impressive (I'm not a CG-hater, but it's definitely overused these days). Having only read a bit of Dune beforehand, I still managed to understand the basic plot line. However, what I didn't like was the acting and the dialogue, which nearly killed the movie for me. Internal monologues are not a bad idea, but were overused and treated the audience like idiots, when what they're thinking is clearly expressed in their emotions. You might think criticizing dialogue is rich coming from someone who loves the Star Wars saga, but in the much maligned Prequel Trilogy, at least George Lucas lets the characters shut up every once in a while. Your father is dead! I know! Why? Because he is the Kwisatz Haderach!. Also, trying to get people on film to shout other people to death is nigh-on impossible to pull off (on Wikipedia I read that they merely shout Muaddib as a death-prayer, which would have been visually more effective).There are some great moments in the film. The baron is so repulsive I nearly threw up, and that's a commendation to the great make-up artists. Patrick Stewart is, well, Patrick Stewart (was this man born 45? He doesn't seem to have aged in the past 20 years) and the vision, as described in these boards, can be wonderfully otherworldly and epic. With a lot of the redundant dialogue cut, and a less woeful knife-fight, this could have been great. I almost gave this a 4, but the vision behind the film tilted it to a 5. That, and the Toto soundtrack, which valiantly defied my expectations and turned out to be rather damn good (I'm a sucker for '80s synth soundtracks).Amir ","genre":null},{"date":"23 January 2006","score":"5 out of 9 people found the following review useful","review":" I usually love cult movies, and have an interest in science-fiction.

This film is unbelievable and, whilst highly entertaining, offers so much more than that. From start to finish, this film has you conceptualising to the point where you can have so many ideas, you can not make a final conclusion. David Cronenberg has a talent for this as he does so many things.eXistenZ is pure Cronenberg; the way it's written and the way it's directed is very unique to his style and that can only be a good thing. Cronenberg set himself a clear target with this film and that was to keep the audience guessing which he did with apparent ease. His fondness for the grotesque is not as predominant in this film as it is in The Fly or Naked Lunch but there are still some elements such as the game pods and how they are made that can make the audience wince. With regards to his earlier work, eXistenZ is more a combination of Videodrome and a less violent Scanners, a pretty awesome combination. Setting the film in the not too distant future was a really good decision as it allowed Cronenberg to be extremely imaginative with the films surroundings and also enabled him to visualise more concepts, allowing for less inhibited writing. It was important that the film didn't become over confusing and Cronenberg avoided this very well by keeping things relatively simple. Besides, if he wanted to make an unwatchable film, he'd know how to do it a lot better than this.eXistenZ boasts an extremely talented cast of character actors and all perform very well. Jennifer Jason Leigh gives the standout performance as the game designer who spends more time out of reality than in to it. Leigh is sexy and commanding in her role as Allegra and she really gets her teeth in to the role. The emotional range she shows in the film is particularly impressive, making her completely believable (if you can believe anything). Jude Law is also good and is very convincing in his character's fear of implantation. The chemistry between these two is very electric and gives the film an extra bit of flavour.

I recommend it to any fan of the actors, thrillers and\/or the subject matter. Highly recommendable, and very watchable. 8\/10 ","genre":"Drama, Mystery, Thriller"},{"date":"23 January 2006","score":"","review":" Serpico is a powerful tale of an honest undercover cop named Frank Serpico, played with finesse by none other than Al Pacino, all dressed up like a hippie, complete with long hair and a beard.Serpico is one of the few honest cops in the New York police department who refuses to take any extra money or bribe, unlike his fellow-cops and partners. He begins to find it difficult carrying on with them, as they are not too happy with him not co-operating. Serpico attempts to bring the police corruption to light.Al Pacino turns in a terrific performance as Serpico. His anguish and anger shows to the fullest and one totally sympathizes with him as the movie progresses. One particular memorable scene, when he makes an arrest and brings the man to the precinct, shows Pacino displaying anger like never before. Tony Roberts is great in a supporting role as Serpico's friend, Bob.Sidney Lumet directs it well, but the movie could have been a tad shorter; it feels like we didn't really need to see some of the scenes which the film could've easily done away with. The editing could have been better. Also, the background score was all wrong in some of the scenes.Those are the only couple of minuses as far as I can see.All in all, Serpico is a must watch for Pacino fans and for any movie buff in general.

I think the beginning was a nice little trick to make the film more unpredictable. The ending is very sad and satisfying at once. It's one of the best endings I have ever seen!Pacino gives a great performance as Carlito Brigante who wants to start a new life and try to get his big love back after he has served 5 years in prison and had a life full of crime, drugs and murder. He wants to open a car-rental business and needs money to start it. But he can't get out of the vicious circle of his old friends! The real star of the movie is Sean Penn, who gives an Oscar worthy performance as Brigantes perfidious lawyer David Kleinfeld. I must say all of the actors gave a great performance, especially Penelope Ann Miller as Gail! The cinematography is very well done. Especially the scene when he is in the bathroom, after his cousin gets killed and he shoots the 3 guys at the pool-table (which also is the DVD-cover)! Then, of course the magnificent ending\/opening shot and another good example is the chase in the station! Overall I think this movie should get more attention because it is a masterpiece which shows Pacino in one of his strongest roles and DePalma at his best!! If you haven't seen it so far, then quickly buy\/watch it...Highly recommended!!

It could have certainly made a good point but all it seems to have done is stir the entire film-watching community into an unfathomable dilemma. To wonder whether you would do such a thing in such circumstances and not be sure you would not is appalling.The idea of the husband agreeing to it is sickening and hard to grasp, but his later inability to cope with the thought of it brings it back down to earth. If a man managed to persuade himself of the insignificance of his wife's having sex just once with another man, he's a fool and either doesn't care or must realize later he was wrong. This guy felt it come home to him as he surely must.And she was made to appear a sweet little self-sacrificing angel, which brings mixed feelings. He agreed to it initially and in theory had no business treating her like a criminal. And yet, she went and carried it out, with no apparent suffering. Anyone with any real integrity, honesty, and well... morals, would surely have some trouble with this, unless they indeed found it alluring enough to overcome their scruples.That rich dude was also well-acted, but how creepy! Sexy he wasn't. He was a stalker, creeping around her everywhere she went and smugly buying her life piece by piece as if it were all part of buying her. I agree with those who said that the idea of his giving her up in the end was a crock. That kind of narcissist doesn't let go once he has what he wants. But I also think he did need to be attractive (on the surface anyhow) because that was pivotal to the jealously of the idiot husband and the uncertainty of the tart wife.This is on my list of movies that never should have been made. It was one long eew moment for me and never once raised the question of whether I would. Believe it or not, there are some folks in the world who can see that it could never be worth it. Money can't buy back a filthy act. It's sad to see the morals of so many degraded to the point that they could even consider it.The rating of 5 stars is for the acting and the film quality.
