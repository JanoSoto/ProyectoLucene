Upon his arrival, he sleeps with a call girl named Zoe (Julie Delpy) who he ends up falling in love with. When Zed goes to meet Eric, he ends up spending the night with him and all of his junkie friends who hide out in a run down apartment building with a dead feline near the entrance to their room. They plan to rob the bank the next morning, and Zed is going to be the safe cracker. After much passing out, puking, hallucinating, and a male rape, Zed and the rest of the gang awaken in a drunken daze, already late for their robbery, and then they foolishly attempt to rob the bank while still moderately trashed, hungover, and restless. Naturally things go very wrong very fast, and it becomes no longer about getting the money, but more about trying to survive.If Roger Avary's intention was to make a truly memorable art house exploitation film, he succeeded with flying colors. I'm pretty sure that this was intention and there's no denying that this is a good film. I have some serious problems with Killing Zoe, however, and those problems have much to do with the first two thirds of the picture. Avary spends a very large portion of the film in this junkie world with these truly atrocious and ugly characters doing ugly things. I felt that too much time was spent in this world. The only likable character is Julie Delpy's character, and she doesn't get nearly enough screen time as she should. As for Eric Stoltz, he pretty much plays the same character as he played in Pulp Fiction, though not anywhere near as much as a prick. His character, Zed, for the most part is a fairly goofy, eccentric, and slight perverted guy. I liked how he wasn't an entirely sympathetic protagonist. His character, for the most part, works. Likewise for his friend Eric, who is a completely horrific villain. He's disgusting, sleazy, skeletal-looking, and a sweaty mess of a man who has little conscience and no morals, and I applaud Jean-Hugues Anglade for playing a role that few actors would have the balls to play. This brings me to my biggest gripe with the film, however. These are the three main characters, but they are also the three most interesting characters as well. Every other character is completely disposable they take up far too much screen time that should have been devoted to the three main characters. To make matters worse, in the third act of the film when the characters actually try to rob the bank, a good portion of all of these characters are killed off almost immediately. While I applaud Roger Avary for crafting such a strong vision of graphic carnage in the third act, I felt that he was betraying the trash quality that took place in the first two acts with these junkie characters getting slaughtered so damn quickly. As the last act of the film stands, most of the characters end up getting killed off almost constantly and with little to no emotion. When it is not a member of the gang getting killed it is either a security guard or an innocent civilian. Somebody is almost always getting killed, often in over-the-top fashion.What I did love about Killing Zoe was the look of the film. The bank that the film takes place in during the final act is just gorgeous in how claustrophobic it is. The walls of the bank are red, and it only adds to the psychotic nature of the Eric character. The character really is quite terrifying, and the bank that Avary shot in has a perfect interior for these sort of characters. The middle section mostly takes place in real grimy, dirty, dark areas that look completely hellish. Somehow the bank looks like a scarier location than the junkie hideouts, and I liked that. The opening and closing scenes show some beautiful shots of Paris as well, which definitely helped elevate the film even more. I also felt that the final act of the film, despite the gratuitous bloodshed and carnage, really was quite suspenseful and intense. The film is so furious in it's tone and the final act really pulls it all together. At times it is difficult to watch because the audience knows right away that the situation is going to go wrong and the characters are doomed. When the bank robbery actually starts, it is so disorganized and so uncoordinated that a feeling of unhinged maniacal danger sets in immediately. It makes the film a little bit different from other heist films. The characters are all young, hapless, and careless people who have abandoned reality.Killing Zoe lacks a sense of control, which both helps and hurts the film. On one hand, it certainly helps make the final act of the film that much more shocking and realistic. On the other hand, it is difficult to look part the first two thirds of the film. I do think that this film has an audience, but I also think that it's difficult to call it a good film. It works in a lot of ways. Visually, it's better than it needs to be. The performances are all very strong, not to mention ballsy, and the vision of hell this film paints is pretty tough to shake. It's a rough film, but it manages to have a lot of energy. It is a very flawed film. However, if you're a fan of trash cinema and exploitation, you may want to give this a try. It's a messy film, but it's effective and definitely memorable.

First, it can be a television series the average American teenager or young adult grew up with in the 1990s, or it can be this a 1992 camp-fest of a film that entertains in its own way but does nothing in the long run. Ironic how the individual film that is this 1992 feature is also capable of being either one of two things; either it's plain old good fun in a 'so bad it's enjoyable' scenario or it can be one of the worst films you'll ever see. For me, it leaned toward second option and that is largely down to the film's finale.I have to say that the film was mildly interesting for two of its three thirds. I say mildly because prior knowledge that the series existed (even though I've never actually seen an entire episode) helped me through and a motivation born out of curiosity also aided. What else can you say about a film that wants to fall into the horror genre and yet has its point of attack revolve around an American high school clique going to the mall and speaking in that annoying monotone fashion? What else can you say about a film that includes vampires as its main threat and yet forgets to include a reaction of some sort from its hero Buffy, played by Kristy Swanson? It's true to say that when Buffy is first made aware of vampires' existence, the camera cuts to a shot of one of her few expressions and the face remains emotionless.But before all that, the film has its gang of teenage American girls (one of which is played by Hilary Swank) going to malls and talking about boys and all that other stuff you'd expect from the stereotype. But the group do raise an interesting point through their dialogue. It revolves around the wearing of clothes that are a season out of fashion to which the girl defends her 'old' attire by exclaiming it to be 'retro'. I'm not sure of their thinking here but it made me muse over how old something had to be in order for it to be considered 'retro' &#150; a few months is surely not enough. But instead of an introduction of why Buffy was chosen and why the mantel is passed onto her, we get an establishment set way back in the past that 'slayers' exist and then it's all high school until the film gets going.Buffy the Vampire Slayer follows a pretty routine formula, that of hero is unbeknown to themselves; hero meets mentor; gets removed from settled place (fish out of water); mentor trains them and then on and on with the odd defeating of evil along the way before the final showdown. In this case the helper along the way is Donald Sutherland's Merrick Jamison-Smythe who seems to be an individual with three surnames rather than one and one forename. Merrick is also the sort of individual who will appear exactly where he needs to be at any one time, usually to help Buffy out. There are also some bizarre scenes early on that tie in with the first encountering of vampires that even Buffy has issues with; she does not like walking through graveyards at night with creepy old men whom she does not even know. But hell, we'll go through with it anyway.Usually in these stories, a strong villain is required to set the tone of menace &#150; one of great pride, stature and ruthlessness; one that will strike a deadly blow at any given time of asking. Lead vampire Lothos (Hauer) fits anything but this description and apart from turning down numerous chances to defeat his enemy, ie; Buffy, he comes across as a bit of a goon dressed in a silly outfit. Why is he even here? What is his goal? Instinct from knowledge of the genre's routine tells me world-domination but I cannot honestly remember. It is not helped by some woeful acting from Hauer himself. Apart from this, the vampires in general come across as duds. It seems these vampires only attack teenagers\/young adults; either that or there are no adults in this entire city to even attack. Indeed, early on some parents leave the immediate area for a lake house; the principal at the finale comes across as the sort of person that should not be running a school and Merrick himself is pretty useless when it comes to the fight scenes.But apart from all the cute formula, which I don't have any gripes with, the film just comes straight off the rails as it enters the final third. In one character, loyal to Lothos, we have an example of one of the worst deaths in cinema history; in fact I'm not sure if we can even call it a death due to what happens at the end of the credits. I don't know if director Fran Rubel Kuzui was still in charge for the climax but to say it's a horrid and muddled finale to an average film is an understatement. Remember that odd feeling you got when you saw everyone in 1976's Bugsy Malone getting soaked with foam and cream with nobody actually dying, thus completely contradicting the film's prior rules? Well, the same feeling happens here with the principal's relaxed attitude and the sheer levels of poor production values the film reaches &#150; it's as if someone else took over to direct. Consequently, I'm not sure how this spawned such a successful TV show given how bad it really was but I guess it's funny to see a 'good' TV series follow a 'bad' film instead of the usual vice-versa we get nowadays.

First, it can be a television series the average American teenager or young adult grew up with in the 1990s, or it can be this a 1992 camp-fest of a film that entertains in its own way but does nothing in the long run. Ironic how the individual film that is this 1992 feature is also capable of being either one of two things; either it's plain old good fun in a 'so bad it's enjoyable' scenario or it can be one of the worst films you'll ever see. For me, it leaned toward second option and that is largely down to the film's finale.I have to say that the film was mildly interesting for two of its three thirds. I say mildly because prior knowledge that the series existed (even though I've never actually seen an entire episode) helped me through and a motivation born out of curiosity also aided. What else can you say about a film that wants to fall into the horror genre and yet has its point of attack revolve around an American high school clique going to the mall and speaking in that annoying monotone fashion? What else can you say about a film that includes vampires as its main threat and yet forgets to include a reaction of some sort from its hero Buffy, played by Kristy Swanson? It's true to say that when Buffy is first made aware of vampires' existence, the camera cuts to a shot of one of her few expressions and the face remains emotionless.But before all that, the film has its gang of teenage American girls (one of which is played by Hilary Swank) going to malls and talking about boys and all that other stuff you'd expect from the stereotype. But the group do raise an interesting point through their dialogue. It revolves around the wearing of clothes that are a season out of fashion to which the girl defends her 'old' attire by exclaiming it to be 'retro'. I'm not sure of their thinking here but it made me muse over how old something had to be in order for it to be considered 'retro' &#150; a few months is surely not enough. But instead of an introduction of why Buffy was chosen and why the mantel is passed onto her, we get an establishment set way back in the past that 'slayers' exist and then it's all high school until the film gets going.Buffy the Vampire Slayer follows a pretty routine formula, that of hero is unbeknown to themselves; hero meets mentor; gets removed from settled place (fish out of water); mentor trains them and then on and on with the odd defeating of evil along the way before the final showdown. In this case the helper along the way is Donald Sutherland's Merrick Jamison-Smythe who seems to be an individual with three surnames rather than one and one forename. Merrick is also the sort of individual who will appear exactly where he needs to be at any one time, usually to help Buffy out. There are also some bizarre scenes early on that tie in with the first encountering of vampires that even Buffy has issues with; she does not like walking through graveyards at night with creepy old men whom she does not even know. But hell, we'll go through with it anyway.Usually in these stories, a strong villain is required to set the tone of menace &#150; one of great pride, stature and ruthlessness; one that will strike a deadly blow at any given time of asking. Lead vampire Lothos (Hauer) fits anything but this description and apart from turning down numerous chances to defeat his enemy, ie; Buffy, he comes across as a bit of a goon dressed in a silly outfit. Why is he even here? What is his goal? Instinct from knowledge of the genre's routine tells me world-domination but I cannot honestly remember. It is not helped by some woeful acting from Hauer himself. Apart from this, the vampires in general come across as duds. It seems these vampires only attack teenagers\/young adults; either that or there are no adults in this entire city to even attack. Indeed, early on some parents leave the immediate area for a lake house; the principal at the finale comes across as the sort of person that should not be running a school and Merrick himself is pretty useless when it comes to the fight scenes.But apart from all the cute formula, which I don't have any gripes with, the film just comes straight off the rails as it enters the final third. In one character, loyal to Lothos, we have an example of one of the worst deaths in cinema history; in fact I'm not sure if we can even call it a death due to what happens at the end of the credits. I don't know if director Fran Rubel Kuzui was still in charge for the climax but to say it's a horrid and muddled finale to an average film is an understatement. Remember that odd feeling you got when you saw everyone in 1976's Bugsy Malone getting soaked with foam and cream with nobody actually dying, thus completely contradicting the film's prior rules? Well, the same feeling happens here with the principal's relaxed attitude and the sheer levels of poor production values the film reaches &#150; it's as if someone else took over to direct. Consequently, I'm not sure how this spawned such a successful TV show given how bad it really was but I guess it's funny to see a 'good' TV series follow a 'bad' film instead of the usual vice-versa we get nowadays.

Years later he is living in New York City, employed as a Postal Worker (despite having a Ph.D) and abiding a contented existence with his girlfriend, when he begins to see strange creatures inhabiting his surroundings. The disturbances take their toll on his mental health and begin to create problems in his love and social lives. Soon he is haunted by his dead son, conspiracy theories and terrifying trans-dimensional trips. Jacob segues in and out of waking reality, trying to come to grips with what happened back in the war.The actors in the film all do a good job and the pacing of the film is solid too. Jason Alexander and the guys playing Jacob's combat platoon are pretty good, so it's too bad we don't see more of them. I found the music to be surprisingly affecting and haunting, which was a pleasant surprise. It was not one-dimensional either, providing a certain amount of variety appropriate to the scenes. Despite the borderline horror element of the movie, it has a decent share of uplifting moments too. It is not a completely bleak gorefest, though it may not be entirely heart-warming either. The biblical references were a bit hokey for me, but they do provide thematic resonance with the story by the end.Perhaps the significant shortcoming of Jacob's Ladder is the non-concrete ending, which feels more like an easy way out for the film-makers than something open to the audience's interpretation (though it is presented that way). The script was apparently written by the same guy who did Ghost, though this is the better film of the two. Similar motifs appear here as in Ghost demons whisking people to hell, life after death, true love. It's also amusing that of these two films written by Bruce Joel Rubin, the director Adriane Lyne directed Jacob's Ladder, considering he works primarily on romantic thrillers.Jacob's Ladder is definitely worth a look for anyone interested in cinematic pop-surrealism, psychological and ethereal horror, suspense, military trauma or bittersweet love. It's a genuinely inspired movie with fine performances from the cast, but it will not sit well with viewers looking for a concise ending wrapped up in a neat package.

James Bond seeks violence; violence seeks Bourne. Bourne has no desire to take others' lives, but wherever he hides, the bloodshed finds him. When it does, he has no choice but to use his lethal skills. I don't even know who I'm running from, he laments. He must devise his next moves quickly. He is not charismatic and he has no swagger. The two JB's are completely different, but the brains and brawn behind The Bourne Identity prove both styles can succeed.A fishing vessel off the coast of France rescues Jason Bourne (Matt Damon), unconscious and floating face up. He has been shot twice and has a laser pointer imbedded in his hip. When he awakes, his biographical memory is gone. The pointer provides the only clue to his identity--an account number to a bank deposit box in Zurich. He uses extremely advanced martial arts to escape intense situations, and what amazing skills they are. He strikes with a superhuman combination of strength, precision and awareness. He seems to have eyes in the back of his head. His environmental perception reaches extraordinary levels, but he cannot understand why, nor the reason somebody tries to kill him in Paris.A mysterious branch of the CIA does know. Its leader, Alexander Conklin (Chris Cooper), fears the implications of Bourne being alive and causing commotion. From his basement war-room, he directs a team assigned to track Bourne and put him in a body bag. After Marie (Franka Potente) drives Jason to Paris, Conklin adds her to the hit list for his specialized assassins (Clive Owen, Nicky Naude).Few action movies work well without a powerful villain. Physically, Chris Cooper is the perfect choice for Conklin. His perfectly slicked hair, bass voice, and face, which looks like the façade to a vault of experience, make the perfect image of a forceful leader. Cooper communicates a lot of information with his mannerisms, mostly while issuing orders with fire in his speech.The great part is that we don't just see him give the orders. We hear them explained, we hear responses from team members, we see the field agents receive their messages and prepare for action. Liman keeps us in the room when he hear his underlings report what they have discovered and how. We see him update his superior (Brian Cox) and discuss with him the next course of action. These scenes add a special flavor to the film.The action appears at an unusual pace, mostly during the first hour. The best are the fistfight in Paris and a car chase that soon follows. Liman follows the top rule for filming action. Do not try to manufacture tension with rapid fire cuts or fancy camera work; let the quality of the production speak for itself. Just find a quality angle to let it speak. It is sad that Paul Greengrass broke it for the two sequels. Only Alex Proyas has permission to that.What is on screen is indeed high quality. It also reveals another difference between Bond and Bourne. Evasion is always his first option. While being chased inside a building, Bourne throws away the gun he takes, the third time in the movie he does that. Even in the climax, he only kills the guards because he has no choice but fighting them. Acting wise, Damon plays Bourne straightforward, nothing fancy here.

Marie's function is companionship and transportation for Bourne. She is more than a sex partner. In fact, Bourne chooses to sleep on the floor when they share a room. Potente also remains toned down. Brian Cox and Gabriel Mann (playing Conklin's top assistant) both bring what their roles need. Cox has his best moment when he tells Conklin You never made a mistake before! Most impressive among the supporting cast is Clive Owen, who speaks volumes with his silence.From Russia with Love is probably the only Bond movie structured like The Bourne Identity. Both are heavily plot and subterfuge focused. The payoff is far better in the former, but Bourne excels more in its slow areas. By keeping a close eye on the details, Liman assures that no moment is boring. There are no Bond-like gadgets since Bourne has no Q to make them. He uses standard equipment in innovative ways. That is only one of the reasons why The Bourne Identity wins in all categories.

The background score and brilliant sound effects manage to create that chilling mood.Another thing that makes 'Jurassic Park' so exciting to watch is the suspense element which is very well built. The viewers wonder who will die next, which dinosaurs will show up, what's the fate of the main characters etc. The opening sequence already gives us the feel that it will be quite a bloodfeast.

It's not that Hithccock put any more or less work into them (although I'm sure 'Thief' had a higher budget), but they reveal to sensibilities that aren't remotely similar. I mean this though as a compliment; Hithcock's film is lavish and lush with colors of those beautiful locations and settings on the French Riviera, and made as a fantastic vehicle for its two stars, Cary Grant and Grace Kelly. It's almost an ode to glamor of the period, and to a outlook on this particular story that's necessary.Another director could have made a decent thriller, maybe a very good one. But Hithccock is after a kind of art here that has POP in big capital letters (not the Andy Warhol type, something more to his liking). It's a lot of fun, too, which is the most important thing, as it allows for the two stars to play off on one another in the style that I'd compare to Bogart and Bacall in The Big Sleep, only here they aren't trumping the convoluted story. Matter of fact, this might be one of the least-probing or psychologically complex of Hitchcock's prime thriller; it's about Robie, a reformed cat burglar (also called the Cat), who is accused of a string of new jewel heists by a copy-cat (no pun intended) in France and goes on the run to clear his name- by spotting over Frances and her mother's plot of jewels. When will the burglar strike again?

But those were in the days before Stonewall and you couldn't be all that explicit. I'm not just talking about sex scenes though there are some here. As far as films were concerned homosexuality was the love that really dare not even breathe let alone speak its name.One reason I liked this film Wilde that starred Stephen Fry in the title role is that the others began with Wilde's involvement with Lord Alfred Douglas, played here by a sexy Jude Law. Here we get a bit of background and we discover that Wilde was a latent case for years because society dictated gay was an abomination. He married and fathered two sons whom he no doubt loved. Just some of the beautiful children's stories he did write attest to that.But as the film opens with Wilde in America and touring a mining camp and giving a lecture to miners below the earth's surface, you can see the look of love in his eyes as he beholds some of those hunky miners with their shirts off. Since you know who Wilde was and his story already, you're looking yourself for signs.Wilde was a latent case until he was seduced by Robbie Ross an actor in one of his plays portrayed by Michael Sheen. I can certainly attest to the fact that if gay is your orientation and you've been with women before, when you do it the first time, you KNOW it's right for you. Later on Ioan Gruffud who apparently is his inspiration for Dorian Gray actually falls in love with Wilde.But Wilde's like a kid in a candy store and when he meets the incredibly handsome Lord Alfred Douglas. Unlike the other two Wilde pictures I mentioned this version fleshes a bit more out of 'Bosy's' character and Jude Law may be pretty to look at, but he's a vain, shallow, selfish, and spoiled young aristocrat. Among other things Law introduces Fry to is the availability of rent boys on the street and at certain posh establishments frequented by closeted Victorians.But it all comes to an end when Bosy's dad played by Tom Wilkinson leaves a calling card accusing Wilde of being a sodomite. In the other two Wilde films, it's Oscar who just arrogantly think he can squash this thing in court with his fabled wit. Here it's Bosy who pushes Wilde into it.The other films concentrated on the trials, civil and criminal. In Wilde the emphasis is on Oscar's character and relationships. The women in Wilde's life are wife Jennifer Ehle and mother Vanessa Redgrave. In watching the two women how they interact it's like watching the families of Ennis and Jack from Brokeback Mountain and how they react to their husband's strange behavior.Also in the film very briefly is Orlando Bloom playing a rent boy. I'm surprised that the film received no Oscar nominations, no pun intended. Though it was honored in the United Kingdom.Some 40 years after Stonewall, the tragedy of Oscar Wilde not being true to his nature as he says he wished he had done from the beginning is still being played out in many areas, in many walks of life. Just look at the number of outings there have been of various political figures on the right and you know it is so.Wilde is a great film which speaks to this generation of GLBT people with current players to tell sadly an often repeated story.

Before vcrs\/dvds, children gathered once a year in front of their televisions and held their breath. The seasonal showing of this film was an event not to be missed and I was no exception.Basically a surreal dream, the story moves with an excellent pacing that has delights at every turn. The Kansas scenes are cleverly timeless, no one talks on a telephone or drives a car for instance and the tornado is a miracle of cinematography. Totally fake, it looks very, very real. Whoever thought of the dual roles deserves a big tip of the hat.Everyone in this film is stellar, but personally the two actors who stand out from the pack are Garland and Hamilton. After so many years I can't imagine anyone else as Dorothy. Garland plays the role wide-eyed and full of conflict, frustrated at every turn she soldiers on and we fall in love with her. Then there is the great character actress Margaret Hamilton. I confess she was the reason I loved the film as a child when most children were terrified of her. Bigger than life, almost unhuman, Hamilton steals every single scene she is in. The combination of Hamilton's stern schoolmarm look and the brilliant costume by Adrian forever defined the perfect witch. Balancing the hat and dragging what looks like a very heavy cape creates a unique movement that is both grand and menacing. Forever remembered for this iconic role, it's a shame Hamilton wasn't recognized in her career with an honorary Academy Award. MGM obviously took advantage of the enormous sound stages. The Munchkinland set is mind boggling, weird and wonderful. Likewise the Emerald City with it's glamor gals (who date the film more than anything else)and the delightful horse of a different color. The Great And Powerful OZ is still one of the coolest special effects ever.The musical score is beautiful, the lyrics to the songs corny but fun and memorable. Over The Rainbow of course stands alone and is probably the highlight of the film. The song foreshadows but also shows the turmoil within Dorothy (and later came to represent the turmoil within Garland). It's one of the most quintessential songs associated with a performer.Thankfully restorations have improved the quality of the print; the first section is presented in it's original sepia tone and the sound is crisp. This film is an American treasure, entertaining young and old for decades. I find it hard to believe that someone might not have seen it, but if you're out there and you're reading this, set aside some time, get comfortable and share a memory.
