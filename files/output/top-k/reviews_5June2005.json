[{"date":"5 June 2005","score":"3 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" For Love of the Game is the story of one baseball player's final game shown through flashbacks from the meeting of a beautiful woman up to the final game in his career. It is a concept that could have worked if the film had not fallen to the melodrama of its love story. Where it manages to stay afloat is in its portrayal of its principal character, Billy Chapel, played by Kevin Costner. In one of the opening scenes, Billy is confronted by the team's owner, Mr. Wheeler (Brian Cox.) Wheeler informs Billy that he has sold the team and the new owners want to trade Billy. Since Billy is 40 years old and at the end of a poor season, Wheeler encourages him to retire. Not exactly what Billy wanted to hear on an exceptionally rough morning&#151;his girlfriend Jane (Kelly Preston) never showed up for their dinner date the night before. Soon Jane calls and tells Billy that she is moving to London for a new job and that she can no longer be with him. She tells Billy that all he needs are the ball, the plate and the game to get by. With that in mind, Billy heads out to the plate in Yankee Stadium to pitch the last game of the season. He throws well but the slightest reminder of the past triggers bittersweet memories, from meeting Jane, the flourishing of their relationship and their ups and downs. Then Billy remembers when he cut his hand in a sawing accident. Thanks to Jane, he manages to get to a hospital and save his hand. But as Billy recovers, he is faced with the notions that he might never throw again. Unwilling to accept this, he pushes Jane away. This is the point in the present that Billy starts to feel the pain in his arm and his throwing becomes a problem. From the pain his arm, to his regret at loosing Jane, we see Billy struggle to top his career. But he swallows his emotions and pain and remembers the words of his father, simply play catch, Billy. Just throw the ball. With that, Billy manages to pitch the perfect game. But naturally, one thing is missing, Jane and it all leads to inevitable airport confrontation ending. The problem with this movie is not in poor performances, but rather in the sappiness of its love story. Preston plays Jane as the kind of woman who can make the simplest things complicated, but with a genuine tenderness that cannot be denied. She is quirky but cares for Billy. But as the film goes into a montage of their early years, we see just about every relationship cliché play out. She asks him the foreseeable questions&#151;Do you believe in God? Have you ever gotten your heart broken? And my favorite, Do you like the dark meat or the white meat, because the dark meat is the fatty part and it's not good for you. Between the rolling of my eyes and my cringing at the embarrassment of these questions, I could not help but ask myself, shouldn't they have established all of this long before now? The biggest problem is the ending. The two kiss, and Billy says to Jane that he loves her. Jane responds, I never believed it. Billy replies, Believe it. The two kiss some more and fades out. It leaves you with nothing to embrace and the picture becomes instantly forgettable. You simply want to walk away saying, Well, there it is.What I do like about the movie is that the central character is faced with a life changing decision&#151;ending his career, his life's passion. Baseball is what he loves and he cannot let it go. Ironically enough, director Raimi would bring this same concept up in his excellent film, Spider-Man 2, five years after For Love of the Game. As Peter Parker\/Spider-Man says, Sometimes we have to give up the thing we want the most to do what is right&#151;even our dreams. That is a tough decision for any person to make when they are part of something they love and for one reason or another, it has to end. In film, if done correctly, this can make for a powerful storytelling riddled with conflict and ultimate resolution. Unfortunately, that is not done here.For Love of the Game is neither entirely bad, nor entirely good. The concept of facing the fork-in-the-road choices work well, and adding a love story was to be expected. However, the film becomes half chick-flick and half a story about moving on. If it could only find a better balance with improved writing, it could have worked out. **1\/2 out of **** ","genre":null},{"date":"5 June 2005","score":"3 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" For Love of the Game is the story of one baseball player's final game shown through flashbacks from the meeting of a beautiful woman up to the final game in his career.

Maybe I should start off by saying that it's really what you'd expect.It's a bad (and I mean bad!) early 60's science fiction movie (but it's one of those so bad it's good...really good movies.) We start off with two doctors in the operating room. Once they're finished with the operation (blood free, of course!) and have touched their faces with their hands (which were just inside the patient's organs but that's OK I'm sure, right?!) Dr. Bill's wife Jan walks into the operating room casually and we find out that they're heading up to the family's country home.Dr. Bill and his wife Jan are now driving up a road to their country home. All of a sudden Bill decides to speed up and how do we know he's speeding up? By shots of moving scenery and his foot pushing on the gas. But then, he's losing control of the car! And how do we know this you ask? We see a sign that reads Winding road and the car turning (using shots they has just shown several times again.) Now they've crashed (and Bill falls from a direction that isn't near where the car has landed) and he takes his wife's severed head (and we're supposed to assume that because he has something wrapped up that he's holding like ball) and yet again no blood is coming out! Now to make a long review a little shorter. Jan becomes Jan in a Pan (who is never referred to as that in the movie so I think adoring fans affectionately gave her that name) and Bill is now on a quest to find Jan a perfect body. Hestarts his quest by going to a stripper club and there's a 6 minute scene of just a stripper dancing with only stripper music playing (which also plays throughout the entire movie whenever there's a scene with flirting going on) then Bill walks back to the stripper's dressing room, they talk, yadda, yadda, yadda...now another stripper who was eyeing Bill walks in, they argue, Bill leaves now the two strippers are having an all out cat fight.Hilarious! It's my favorite part of the movie because it is so pointless and has NOTHING to do what so ever with the movie! Oh and when the cat fight is over there's a shot of a cat on the wallpaper and we hear a MEOW! Now he's at a beauty contest. They announce there's five beauties to come out. Only four show up. Pointless and stupid once again.Also, in between these little quests for Jan's perfect body have been Jan and a monster talking back and forth (one tap for yes, three if you can hear me!) There was also some other experiment who is also deformed (it's his hand which we're supposed to believe is really deformed when it's really just the actor curling up his hand.) The monster is so thoroughly locked in his room (with a simple door with hinges and an everyday padlock of course! That does it's job great!)Now Bill is on a quest to find an old friend who is scarred. He shows up at her place and there are photographers there (right, like a woman would be safe alone at night, in a bikini, alone in her apartment, with a bunch of men taking picture of her!) She shows him his scar (which to me looks like a mark that you'd get from sleeping on your face after you wake up in the morning.) She says she doesn't trust anyone after being scarred by a man who she put all her trust in yet she's going out into the middle of the night alone with a man she barely can remember.The ending is that Dr. Bill brings what's her face back to his house, he drugs her, she passes out, the Monster escapes (somehow he musters up the strength to knock down that hard to open door by taking it off it's hinges. Dr. Bill is killed and now we can see the Monster (the actor's hair is visible I think.) Another goof that I noticed was that the actor's lips didn't match the words that were being said!

I thought she was precious (though many hate her.) I want one of my own now....The real pathetic thing is that when this was first released that many people were probably horrified by it. And for those that weren't they had the eye candy in there for those who got bored.The movie also makes itself look even more pathetic that in the end credits it lists the wrong title with The Head That Wouldn't Die then THE END below it.Not sure what to rate it so I won't rate it at all.

Tough loner streetwise gun-wielding woman with connections to the Mob saves a kid from a family-murder committed by the mob. Mob goes searching for kid because he is evidence for the police. Woman starts to really like the kid and goes to great lengths to protect him, at the cost of her own safety.

The boy whom she looks after comes across as a smart aleck who always has something to say about everything.

I have to say though, that although I initially was quite put off by the cheesy dialogues, Gena Rowland's character began to grow on me and I eventually started to like every single cheesy line that spouted from her gob. She doesn't appear to me to be a terribly tough-looking moll though, and its telling because somewhere in the middle of the movie, the boy had to say to her You're so tough... - is that an attempt by the director to try and project to us the audience that Gloria really is a toughie, even though she fails to project to us by her own performance and appearance that she really is tough??? I don't know, yet I can see how this movie is destined to belong on those video racks classified as Cult Classics. Its soundtrack, for one, is very very typical of the era in which the movie was shot. We never get movies which play music like that anymore. This is point one which makes it a possible cult classic. Another point that makes this show a cult classic is the cheesy one-liner Mafia scripts. Surely there's pleasure to be had in enjoying one of these movies every now and then!

While it's not wholly original, and influences from the classic Robinson Crusoe story especially shine through, we haven't seen all that many films of this nature in recent years and therefore this is a refreshing yarn. Tom Hanks stars as the businessman unlucky enough to find himself stranded, all alone, on an island in the middle of nowhere. Completely cut off from any kind of society, our hero must do all he can to survive the elements that he has found himself in. Unlike most films that we've seen Hanks in before, this performance is very much of a physical nature, and his lack of dialogue gives the actor a very different feel to what he usually evokes from the audience. Tom Hanks had to work hard to give this performance, as the role requires a lot of hard work; but he's risen to the challenge excellently, and this movie has given me more respect for the actor I, at one time, didn't have any respect for at all.The way that Robert Zemeckis draws us into the protagonist's plight is really well done, and throughout the movie you almost feel like you are marooned on the island as well. I was sat transfixed with the action on screen, and my viewing of this movie marks one of the most engaging I've ever had in my film watching career. It's amazing how Hanks can be sat talking to a volleyball with grass stuck to it's head and have the audience engrossed in the action. Ironically, Hanks talking to a volleyball was much more interesting than any conversations he had with real actors in movies such as Philadelphia and Apollo 13. The film is very realistic throughout, and this helps the movie no end when it comes to drawing the audience in as this could very much be a documentary feature of a true story; such is the realism of the picture. It comes across most evidently in the scenes that see Hanks writhe in pain after gashing his leg on a stray rock in the ocean. We actually FEEL his pain, and that is testament to the power of this movie. It took me five years to finally catch this film, and even then it was only by accident. If I was you and I hadn't seen this film yet, I'd do so ASAP.

I don't know about other people, but personally I had heard of his name before, but certainly couldn't name any of his movies. Now that has changed. Since I've seen Ghost Dog The Way of the Samurai I'll try to see at least a couple of his other movies as well, because I really liked this one.Ghost Dog The Way of the Samurai is a quite unique movie. It tells the story of an African-American mafia hit-man in New York who lives by the rules of the Samurai, in simplicity and alone with his pigeons, who calls himself Ghost Dog and who is always faithful to his master, a local mobster who has saved his life several years ago. When the daughter of the local mob boss witnesses one of Ghost Dog's hits, he must die himself. The first victims are his birds and in response, Ghost Dog goes right at his attackers. He is lethal, but does not want to harm his master or the young woman. And while his life is in constant danger, the only people he ever has contact with are a little girl, with whom he discusses books, and a Haitian ice cream man who only speaks French and doesn't understand a word of what Ghost Dog tells him.I guess the best way to categorize this movie is to call it a mix of the movie Léon, the Samurai code and hip-hop culture. Normally you would think that such a mix could never work, but this time it does. I admit that it certainly isn't a normal mix, but Jarmusch avoids the traps that would make this original and daring movie a complete waste of time and which would turn it into one unbelievable and unrealistic mess. I know it sounds strange, how can a movie that combines Italian, Japanese and hip-hop culture into one ever become one solid movie? Don't ask me, I don't even know how he came up with the idea, but it works and that's all that matters.This movie has several strong points. One is the way everything is told and shown, which make this a sober, but powerful movie. Especially with the quotes that are taken from the Way of the Samurai and that are voiced by Forest Whitaker, a solid base is formed. This helps you to understand why the man does what he does, why he lives his life like that and why he will always respect his master. If this hadn't been in the movie, I would probably not have liked it a bit. The other strong point is the acting. The mobsters look a bit stereotypical, but are well portrayed by people like Cliff Gorman, John Tormey, Richard Portnow,... but the best performance definitely comes from Forest Whitaker. Normally Whitaker plays the role of a good guy, like for instance Jody in The Crying Game or Captain Ramey in Phone Boot and it has to be said, he really has some talent for that kind of roles. But, as he proves with this movie, he is capable of a lot more. He plays the role of the samurai hit man, doesn't look like he's fit for that role at all (at least, I would never think of him when it comes to that role), but does it really very well. As a conclusion I would like to add that the sound track is also very nice. Normally I'm not too much a fan of hip hop in the movies, although I can appreciate it as a form of music on itself, but this time it really works. Add to this some nice acting, a cool and well-written story, some funny moments (like for instance a rapping mobster) and what you'll get is a movie that is fun and interesting to watch.

Why would she turn her only son away. No matter what he has done, you don't turn away a child. ESPECIALLY when he is throwing that kinda cash at you!! Hell, I would love for my kid to give that to me, regardless of how they got it. To sum it up, this was an absolute masterpiece. No other movie could be better than this, and they just don't make movies like this anymore.

Vulnerable to the deadly scratch of the cat, the sleepwalker feeds upon the life-force of virginal human females. Probable source of the Vampire legend - Chillicoathe Encyclopaedia of Arcane Knowledge 1st Edition, 1884. I guess that was the easiest & laziest way for the filmmakers to establish what sleepwalkers are without lots of boring exposition. For most of it's running time Sleepwalkers is set in 'Travis, Indiana' where the last two remaining sleepwalkers Mary Brady (Alice Krige) & her son Charles (Brian Krause) live in a farmhouse, the same one used in the classic T.V. series The Waltons (1972 - 1981) believe it or not. They recently moved there from Ohio & Charles is showing an interest in one of his new classmate's, the rather fine looking Tanya Robertson (Madchen Amick). Tanya starts to fall for his handsome boyish looks & charm but not everyone is as easily convinced including one of Charles teachers, Mr Fallows (Glenn Shadix) who discovers that his transfer papers are frauds & Charles isn't who he says he is & definitely didn't relocate from Ohio. After taking care of Mr. Fallows & having a run in with a cop named Andy Simpson (Dan Martin) Charles decides to make his move for Tanya as both time for himself & his Mother is running out & they have to feed soon, but Tanya doesn't intend on letting two sleepwalkers suck her life-force dry & plans on giving as good as she gets...Co-produced & directed by Mick Garris I thought Sleepwalkers was an average horror film at best. The script written by Stephen King & not based on any of his previous works is silly, very vague & doesn't make much sense. The entire set-up of Sleepwalkers is achieved in that opening paragraph of text & no other explanation for the existence of sleepwalkers is given, neither why they need the life-force of virgins to live or why they are so vulnerable to cats. We, the viewer that is, have to accept what happens during the film with virtually no reasoning to back anything up. The word underdeveloped comes to mind. The script also chucks in an incestuous relationship between Charles & Mary but this amounts to one scene of them supposedly having sex together in bed & is neither mentioned again or elaborated on at all. The sleepwalkers also seem able to magically make things invisible which is a neat trick to have but hardly plausible, this ability ends up feeling out of place in a film about cat like creatures & as a whole the script seems to take itself very seriously which considering what I just said wasn't the way to go, was it? Talking of taking itself seriously what's all the jokey one-liners by Charles & Mary all about? The biggest single plot point which I just can't get over is if Tanya was so important to the sleepwalkers survival why did they just not kill her when they had the perfect opportunity to? Why did Mary let Charles take her to the cemetery? Why not just keep her at the farmhouse? Why does Charles attract so much attention to himself by playing around with the police when I'd have thought he would want to keep a low profile? Sleepwalkers isn't all bad though, it moves along at a fairly good pace & when all said & done it's an entertaining enough way to waste 90 odd minutes as long as you can suspend your disbelief & not ask too many question's. The special effects are OK & there is some decent gore in Sleepwalkers like a severed hand, bitten off fingers, a corkscrew in an eye, an impalement, a pencil stuck in someones ear & someone is stabbed with some corn, don't ask. The sleepwalkers themselves when finally revealed look alright if a little cheap. The acting is OK & Sleepwalkers features a number of cameo's by various horror icons like Stephen King himself who plays the cemetery caretaker, John Landis as a lab technician & Joe Dante as his assistant, Clive Barker & Tobe Hooper as forensic officers & Luke Skywalker himself Mark Hamill as a cop in the opening sequence. Ron Perlman also turns up in a small role. Technically Sleepwalkers is above average for a low budget horror with nice production values throughout, it does look a bit bland at times though & director Garris fails to generate or sustain much atmosphere or tension. Sometimes Sleepwalkers looks & feels a bit too much like a bland & forgettable T.V. film. A quick word about the music & specifically the main theme, Boadicea by Enya which sounded very familiar because The Fugees used it as backing for their song Ready Or Not & it sounded strange to hear it pop up on occasion during Sleepwalkers. Overall I didn't hate Sleepwalkers but neither did I love it, I found it very middle of the road. There's nothing particularly wrong with it but there's nothing particularly good either. Sleepwalkers is a reasonable way to pass 90 odd minutes if you are able to forget about the plot holes & just accept what Garris & King are telling you without too many question's...

","genre":"Horror"},{"date":"5 June 2005","score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" In this movie, we're introduced to the origins of both Batman and the Joker. Which works because this is the first movie of its kind and draws the audience into the Bat world.Tim Burton was a relative unknown, given his success at that time was Pee Wee and Beetlejuice, which also starred Michael Keaton. However, he stuck to a vision that everyone expected - that of Frank Miller's Year One and The Dark Knight Returns. Fans were skeptical if Michael Keaton can deliver as the dark knight, but his performance brought on a decent Bruce Wayne, and a menacing Batman. Michael Keaton developed 2 voices for Batman\/Bruce Wayne, with the former being lower in tone. He set the benchmark in which the other Batmans\/Bruce Waynes will be compared. Nice touches in the script also demonstrates the Bat's penchant for appearing and disappearing, which adds to his mystery as an urban legend, and his crashing through the skylight of the museum with cape spread? Priceless. The putting on the batsuit scene also set a precedence, and the rest of the films will have something similar.And who could forget Jack Nicholson's Joker, who really stole the show as he danced along to Prince's soundtrack for the movie. I remembered the first time I saw the Joker's face (heavily guarded secret at that time), and saw the permanent maniacal smile that sent the chills. Nicholson, though a bit pudgy for the role (check the comics - the definitive look by Adams, Aparo, Borland, is always slim), owned the trademarked laughter.The movie introduced a myriad of support characters, some of whom are staples in the comics - Alfred the Butler (played by Michael Gough, one of the constant in this franchise), Commissioner Gordon (played by Pat Hingle, also another constant), Harvey Dent (yes, he's in the movie as District Attorney, played by Billy Dee Williams) and Vicki Vale (Kim Basinger!), and some of whom are created for this movie, like mob boss Carl Grissom (Jack Palance), reporter Alexander Knox (Robert Wuhl) and Jerry Hall as Alicia.But one character stood out amongst all. The Batmobile. Always a feature in the comic books, and always the one which attracts all the attention. To many fans and movie goers, this is the definitive Batmobile for the movies - menacing looking, yet slick and beautiful, with a big bad afterburner to deliver that extra turbo boost. The audience gasped in awe the first time it was on screen, parked outside the museum when Vicki Vale was saved. I always drool at the poster - the one with Batman, arms folded, standing beside the Batmobile.While the film's narrative was dark, twisted yet fun, and Gotham being brought to life by sets designed by the late Anton Furst, fanboys did have some qualms about the movie, which I will discuss here.Firstly, Batman doesn't kill. Sure, he'll kick the ass out of you, but he draws the line at taking a life. This is something which will resonate throughout the movie franchise, which I detest. Yes I know, it's Hollywood, and body count makes an action movie.Although the budget was huge, some effects were still cheesy, like the Joker's helicopter, which was really a toy model (no attempts to make it no so obvious), and the entire crashing of the Bat-wing into the streets of Gotham looks like it took a poor man's lesson from Godzilla's model making.While touching on the origins, it pays not to screw it up big time. Sure you can update it for the movies, but some things are sacred and should stay as such. Sure, we're shown the Waynes being gunned down in Crime Alley (and that scene in which Bruce pays regular homage is noteworthy), but it's always to an unknown Joe Chill. Here, the Joker (as Jack Napier) was the killer, just to facilitate the plot. I would like to state that the Joker did not kill the Waynes. Never did, and this aspect never will change.Also, with origins, Jim Gordon wasn't Commissioner when the Batman first appeared (ok, slightly contentious here, since Bob Kane did introduce Gordon as Commissioner, and only in recent times had this been changed. But I'm sticking to the latter). My main gripe here is the relationship - there is zero chemistry between Gordon and Batman, which I hoped would improve in the latter movies, but was utterly disappointed. Their relationship is key in the mythos, and sadly, this is always overlooked. Gordon in the movies is just a support cameo character. Sad, but true.We don't see much of what Bruce Wayne does. Vicki Vale's question and what do you do for a living was conveniently interrupted by Alfred the Butler. Sure we know he has his millions, but what does he do besides walking around town? Wayne Tech \/ Wayne Industries are not shown in Burton's movies, which are key areas in which Batman derives his toys from.It's not as if I disliked the film. I liked it, and so do many others back in 1989. Many fans were satisfied with the outcome, and made it the Blockbuster for that year.

Cain or Jim Thompson. They also seemed to be trying to mix in some of the arch wit and cynicism of an Alfred Hitchcock movie or a Lawrence Block Burglar novel. However, they pretty much missed the mark with the last objective, and the first two have already been done quite well by films such as 'Body Heat' and 'Miami Blues', so 'Wild Things' ends up looking a bit shabby by comparison.The problem is the nature of the story material. Noir thrillers always have two overriding themese 1) People (Especially Women) Are No Damned Good (CRIME) and 2) Instant Karma's Gonna Get Ya Every Time (PUNISHMENT). A noir movie has to incorporate these two themes in new and unpredictable ways, and Wild Things simply thrashes around too much in an attempt to do something new while it moves from the CRIME theme to the PUNISHMENT. Trying not to be derivative, the story ends up exhausting the viewer's patience. A master plotter like Loren Estleman could have streamlined this puppy and simplified it while preserving the 'wheels with wheels' factor going, but the screenplay here just doesn't know when to say 'WHEN'. And there's the matter of taste and restraint, of which 'Wild Things' has none. Keep in mind that Cain and Thompson had plenty of sleazy, trashy, sociopath characters in their books, and it took considerable care and taste to bring their plots to a movie without overloading the Sleaze Meter and making the viewer loathe and despise everybody in the story. But somewhere in the process of making this film, the director lost control and let the whole thing lurch over into I Hate Every Major Character In This Film territory. I think I hit my gag limit with the totally gratuitous nude shower shot of Kevin Bacon. It didn't add a thing to the story, and was obviously just there to expose yet another acre of flesh to the camera. All of my quibbles with this film are really with the screenplay. I think the actors are all high level pros who do what they do really well...it's just that the movie requires them to play repellent characters. And boy, are they repellent! In defense of Denise Richards, no she can't act, but she never really is given a chance to act, in this film or most others. Film makers just use her as a Barbie Doll with nice boobs and striking eyebrows - kind of like the 2nd coming of Brooke Shields. That is again the case here. I think that it is still possible that Richards could go the route of Jennifer Connelly and eventually do credit to some 'real' actresses roles...If she is ever given the chance.And the movie LOOKS great. Wonderful scenery, lighting, camera work and production values. However, when you have to use this as a defense for a movie's quality, you are basically admitting that the problems with acting or direction or storyline are insupportable. I am not saying you shouldn't see this movie...you just have to be in the right mood to enjoy it. If I had to described the internal criteria a viewer needed in order to enjoy this movie, he or she would be saying to them self I'd like to watch something like 'Body Heat', or The Postman Always Rings Twice, but it doesn't have to be as good.

It didn't add a thing to the story, and was obviously just there to expose yet another acre of flesh to the camera. All of my quibbles with this film are really with the screenplay. I think the actors are all high level pros who do what they do really well...it's just that the movie requires them to play repellent characters. And boy, are they repellent! In defense of Denise Richards, no she can't act, but she never really is given a chance to act, in this film or most others. Film makers just use her as a Barbie Doll with nice boobs and striking eyebrows - kind of like the 2nd coming of Brooke Shields. That is again the case here. I think that it is still possible that Richards could go the route of Jennifer Connelly and eventually do credit to some 'real' actresses roles...If she is ever given the chance.And the movie LOOKS great. Wonderful scenery, lighting, camera work and production values. However, when you have to use this as a defense for a movie's quality, you are basically admitting that the problems with acting or direction or storyline are insupportable. I am not saying you shouldn't see this movie...you just have to be in the right mood to enjoy it. If I had to described the internal criteria a viewer needed in order to enjoy this movie, he or she would be saying to them self I'd like to watch something like 'Body Heat', or The Postman Always Rings Twice, but it doesn't have to be as good.

If the director begins by telling the story from the middle, it is but obvious that we would have missed the introductions of the cast and their relationship with each other! Magnolia is a tiring, pointless movie, which is best avoided if you don't want to ruin a good part of your day (it seems to run for about 15 hours!). ","genre":"Drama"}]
