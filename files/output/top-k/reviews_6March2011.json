Nothing more. If God thinks things on Earth were screwed up in 1980, what would he possibly think now? Are these rising gas prices his way of getting our attention these days? This film is a sequel to film in which God (George Burns) apparently used John Denver to help spread his message. I guess it either didn't work, or so many people were afraid of Denver's singing that they didn't want to tune in and find out. In this film, God picks a young girl named Tracy to come up with a slogan that could get people to think about him once again. Being as her father is in advertising, she would seem to be a good fit. But then why wouldn't God just pick him to do it? Well, you see it's because kids are cuter when they are out spreading a slogan like Think God. In no time Tracy and her friends have plastered or written the message in chalk all over their L.A. neighborhood. Needless to say, the school board types are not amused. And if any kid tried this today.... sheesh! Who would show up to protest first? Probably the ACLU, followed by Michael Moore. Anyway, Tracy's troubles are just getting started.God sure doesn't make this easy on her! Not only is it tough to think of a good slogan, but he also talks to her where others can see. Of course they cannot also see God, so they all think Tracy is talking to herself and losing her mind. Also, her school work suffers. God does at least help her with her math, and he admits he made mathematics too hard. I agree. Tracy is eventually expelled from school, picked apart by doctors, and has her life turned inside out. But she is doing God a favor, so I guess its worth it. There is also a small subplot about Tracy's separated parents reconciling after a few jokes about the big breasts of her father's new girlfriend. The acting is good enough. Burns plays essentially himself which is charming as expected. Louanne, who plays Tracy isn't as annoying as most child actors. The parents are good enough. The film delivers about what you'd expect. Its passable family viewing, but atheists should steer clear. 7 of 10 stars.The Hound.

In fact, her father is a big-wig with a French political party that prides itself on its righteousness and pro-traditional morality stance. This is a serious problem, as the man was raised in a home with two fathers--a biological one and the father's lover--who just happens to be a cross-dressing star of a cabaret! So, to try to get the father to give his blessing, everyone conspires to hide this--to pretend that the young man was raised in a very conservative home. At first, it means possibly having the boy's biological mother pose as the mother--even though she abandoned him when he was a child. Then, when she doesn't show, the father's lover (already a cross-dresser extraordinaire) decides to fill in for her and pretend to be the mother! Will this elaborate ruse work?! A few months ago, my oldest daughter and I saw the play for La Cage Aux Folles on Broadway. The show was marvelous and we had a wonderful time. Now, we both sat down to see the original French film on which the play was based. In retrospect, this was not the best way to have seen the movie, as it simply was better and made the movie look a lot worse by comparison. I think if I'd seen the movie first, I would have done a much more favorable review here on IMDb.Plot-wise, the film and play are very similar. The biggest difference is not WHAT happens but how. So, despite the events being mostly the same, the film falls quite flat in comparison because the characters seem to lack heart. In other words, there isn't the same loving chemistry there was in the play. In the play, no matter what, you KNOW that the people all love each other down deep. In this film, however, they all seem a bit selfish. In addition, the film lacks some of the humor of the play--though I could live more with that than the coldness of the characters towards each other. Good--but it could have been a lot better.By the way, for a French comedy with a gay theme that was better AND directed by the same man who wrote the screenplay for La Cage Aux Folles, try The Closet--a delightful and poignant movie indeed.

Most people who review these movies seem to disagree, as old movies tend to get higher ratings than modern movies. I watch a lot of movies - roughly about one a day - and I like watching old movies. I find old movies fascinating in the same way that I like to see how music has changed. But new movies are much more able to evoke emotions than old movies, though admittedly there's a lot of rubbish around. The picture quality now tends to be better, and the cinematography more advanced. Jaws, for instance, is so frightening because it matches what we do in our minds to frighten ourselves, and old movies generally fail to do this. Further, modern acting tends to be better and the scripts better - movies are now all-round more professionally done. Try watching the old and new versions of 310 to Yuma, end to end, if you disagree with what I say. That said, Nosferatu I think is really quite a good movie, well advanced of most other movies I've seen of the period - bit of a landmark in movie making, I'd say. It might be a bit clunky in scene changes & in other ways, but I think it's truly a bit chilling, which most horrors, including many modern horrors, fail to achieve.Try following this movie up by watching John Malkovich's & Willem Defoe's Shadow of the Vampire.

It takes forever (seemingly), and just two years after Wallace and Gromit's last adventure, we get this superbly animated, well thought out short film, that is actually as exciting as many live action adventure pictures. Proof that Nick Park and crew are about quality, because after the success of the Wrong Trousers it would be easy to cash in on a less than great installment, but thankfully for us, that's not the case.A mysterious wool shortage has plagued the town where Wallace and Gromit, who are now cleaning windows, live. What lies before this man and dog duo is a love interest, a sheep rustling murderous dog, and a lot of sheep. When thinking of the original three Wallace and Gromit shorts, I've always put this one and the Wrong Trousers nearly on par as perfect shorts, and while I still feel that way, this one falls a little short of their second adventure, and yet this has nothing really wrong with it to make it worse. When you have two perfect shorts, one is going to probably be favored over the other, and the lack of talking and pure clay animated suspense that Wrong Trousers produced stands above this equally wonderful, but more grandiose outing. Either way, this is seriously great, and one of the greatest short films out there.The animation has improved greatly since The Wrong Trousers. The animation is smoother, the sets are more three dimensional and the town in which they live in is given more of a personality, and fingerprints aren't as prominent on the figures. And the animation on the action sequences is superb. The last film gave us the hilarious train sequence, and this one gives us many action sequences, most notably being the motorcycle chase and the oatmeal machine gun shootout which are both spectacular and hilariously implausible. The whole five (or so) minute chase scene in the film is seriously as interesting, well thought out, and action packed as most regular action flicks, and it manages to be so without any violence or explosions. Truly a testament to the writing and animation of this thing.Composer Julian Nott is also a huge part of this film. His music sounds like a mix of suspenseful thriller music, and a German polka...an unlikely combination, but one that fits so perfectly, giving the scenes a playful bounce, along with a something bad is going to happen feel. A new addition to the score for this film that wasn't in the previous two was the love theme which is almost a parody of love themes, but one that stands on it's own and also works perfectly in the scenes.Wallace and Gromit represent not just quality animation, but also top notch writing, well thought out jokes and gags, fantastic direction from Nick Park, and proof that animation is not just for kids.

A new addition to the score for this film that wasn't in the previous two was the love theme which is almost a parody of love themes, but one that stands on it's own and also works perfectly in the scenes.Wallace and Gromit represent not just quality animation, but also top notch writing, well thought out jokes and gags, fantastic direction from Nick Park, and proof that animation is not just for kids. Nick Park and the team at Aardman animation can easily be thought of as the Pixar team of England.My rating **** out of ****. 31 mins. Not rated, but good for the whole family.

Otherwise you will think that they are a bunch of raving maniacs. I happened to be interested in the Romantics, thus I knew a lot about the stories generated from the time spent in the famous villa. There the most famous novel of Mary Shelley, Frankenstein was conceived. I had read the novel in the English language with a dense introduction that was describing the preoccupations of Shelley's circle, the infatuation of the age with the newly discovered electricity and the belief that it could generate life. Also I knew about the intricate relationships of the characters involved.If someone without this background tries to understand what the movie is about, he will be disappointed unless he has such a fine artistic sensibility and general education that can fill the gaps of the ignorance of the facts and emotions surrounding this coterie of quite exceptional people.All the information relevant is contained in the dialogues and images but unless you knew that before you would be unable to make the relevant connections or understand why the characters behave in such a manner, why and what they speak about and the whole purpose of it all.The actors are good I think for their roles. Gabriel Byrne has the latent evil touch and subdued lasciviousness that we attribute to Byron, Julian Sands is truly, the Mad Shelley, as he was called by his fellow schoolboys when at Eton, Timothy Spall gives a grotesque image of Dr. Polidori, which is perhaps unavoidable given the fact that tradition has so much focused to the personalities of the two great literary men that his reputation has been eclipsed, therefore a normal appraisal is perhaps impossible. Myriam Cyr as Claire Clermont follows the conventional interpretation of her character as a sensuous girl attracted by the fame of the poets and lacking herself the depth and gravitas of Mary Shelley. Natasha Richardson is the most normal character among the protagonists and has a fine sequence of scenes, near the end, where she sees as if a prophetess the ensuing fate of many of the characters, which latter developments validate. The other point I wanted to make about Claire Clairmont is that when she is not portrayed as a slut with cultural pretensions, she is shown in a condition of animalistic primitivism or as possessed by demons. Dr. Polidori is also a buffoonish homosexual who eyes both the great poets. It is clear that because Claire Clairmont and Dr. Polidori were the ones of the company that did not achieve literary fame, because the were not the literary monuments the other two and to a lesser extent Mary Shelley later became, they have to suffer in the hands of posterity when a director has to cast their roles so as to fill the required quorum along with the great ones. Not only life but also posthumous reputation is unfair....Sound and visual effects are adequate and achieve surprise and fear, especially the first time the movie is watched. A lot of demons and related creatures occupy the screen. One though must not blame the director for overdoing it because those elements formed the staple iconography of the so called Gothic atmosphere and the diaries of the heroes contain references to hallucinations and the like, perhaps because of drug taking, or just because the symbiosis of some of the most active and strong imaginations alive during that particular time.The best word that I can use to describe this movie is uneven. It has good actors, it is supported by sound and scenic effects, it has costumes that look authentic but at times it becomes disgusting, chaotic, devoid of a real plot and radiates hysteria. There are attempts towards sexual explicitness, though by today's standards not so offensive; it must have been for the eighties though...I was interested in the movie because I am very interested in the Romantics. Otherwise it can be seen as a story of rich people indulging to their decadent appetites for sex, drugs, aimless philosophising and self-absorption, reminding one of a company of people devoted to Marquis de Sade's idea of pleasure(graphic illustrations of his books are page-turned by Mary). Mind you, if tabloids had existed during that time the story would have been a scoop. It might even hit YouTube. When famous people follow their fancies or get their kicks, it is always different from simple plebeians.... Apart from the literary fame of the characters, which in their lifetime was actually secured only by Byron, Shelley and even more Mary Shelley were to be vindicated by posterity; and Shelley was actually more famous-that is- notorious for his unconventional sexual mores, his atheism and his political radicalism, rather than for his verse, is this a story actually worthy to be made to a movie? I can not give a definite answer. Would such a story of drugs, free love (actually sex), hallucinations and sheer self-absorption be of interest to anyone? But of course it produced Frankenstein the most famous of Gothic novels &#x85;. I do not think that all this creativity was portrayed in the film. It focused more on the bad, mad and dangerous to know aspects of the characters. In that sense I do not think it does justice to what happened in the villa of Geneva and mainly to what was produced.

Mc Murphy comments an imaginary baseball game with such enthusiasm the images seem to come alive. All the inmates of the Mental Institution are laughing, cheering and shouting, while the head administrative Nurse, Mildred Ratched, asks for silence. But for one brief instant, they're free, and this freedom, as illusory as it is, has never been so palpable, it was freedom to challenge the authority, to transcend the limits of a blanked out TV set&#x85; this short but powerful moment perfectly illustrates the philosophy of Milos Forman's masterpiece One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. One of the all-time greatest films and most inspiring invitations to rebel against the tyranny of establishment.In fact, the greatness of the film exceeds the context of the story, but I think what makes it so impacting is the presence of a clear antagonism through the interactions between two polar opposite sides of human nature  order and rebellion. Order is represented by one of the most iconic and despicable cinematic villains ever Nurse Ratched, perfectly portrayed by Louise Fletcher. A woman, whose soft voice, cold eyes, and passive aggressive attitude is the incarnation of the cold tyranny of rules, as sterile and unproductive as they are. Doesn't this ring a bell? You know, where every thing must go the way it has always been, for no other reason than that the opposite reality would be dangerous. What deviates, what is different disturbs and must be brought back to the road, or eliminated. Fascism? Not so far. Anyway, this tyranny does have a castrating effect on the inmates, all males. And the liberation will come from the protagonist, R.P. Mc Murphy, Jack Nicholson at the peak of his career, playing his most inspiring and unforgettable role. McMurphy as the character who best defines Nicholson.McMurphy, with his inseparable beanie, malicious eyes, pornographic cards and foul-mouthed (body) language, is not just the hero of the film, he's also a tragic icon of New Hollywood, a wave that provided one of the greatest films of history. Almost a Christ-figure, this is a man who will sacrifice many opportunities to be free, in order to free other inmates from an unfair perception. From the dictatorship of a society that treats them as outcasts, as people who deserve to be domesticated, to repress their nature, if they want to become or to be considered as normal. This is the ultimate freedom, the one of the spirit, almost Nietschian to accept yourself instead of trying to be accepted by society, and screw society if she labels you as crazy. It's your freedom of thought and any form of thought is subversive. This defiance is taught by McMurphy as soon as he enters the lives of this world made of weird faces, funny attitudes, and unpredictable reactions, after discovering the masquerade. They are this way, because they're asked to follow some rules whose only purpose is to give a pseudo meaning to their lives, because life is supposed to be guided, to be punctuated with rituals and cycles, it's the lobotomizing effect of routine medication time, music, exercises, the so-called therapy where they have to share their problems, highlighting the true sadistic behavior of the Nurse. They don't even realize how alienated they are, and how this monotony will never solve anything but just keep them away from the rest of the world, maintaining a normality in microcosm.McMurphy breaks this routine, making Nurse Ratched his enemy. His free-spiritedness grows on the inmates who start talking, raising their hands, challenging the power the ultimate rebellious attitude. And another strength of the film is the ambiguity of McMurphy's character who might as well be perceived as a rebel who just want to make a mess, while Ratched is the one who tries to maintain some order. Those who label Ratched as fascist will probably face the pro-Ratched who'll consider McMurphy as an anarchist. But this is an intellectual debate while the movie deserves to be taken on a more emotional level to understand how Ratched is the true villain of the film. Her irresponsible sadistic behavior will provoke one of the saddest cinematic death, not because she deliberately wanted to kill but she was so coldly heartless, she didn't find another way to assess her power. She obviously regretted the act when it was too late, but she pushed the level of respect and obedience to the extreme, twisting the concept of order into dictatorship.One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is not about who's crazy or who's not, after all, before the fishing scene, didn't the inmates ironically look like doctors, especially the famous Dr. Scanlon? It's about resurrection of repressed personalities, through playing poker, basket-ball, fishing, drinking, having fun, becoming ourselves, by refusing to be passive and to be the actors of our own lives. The film is driven by a wonderful supporting cast, probably the most memorable non big-star supporting cast where each character is authentic in his own way, Cheswick, Sefelt, Scanlon, Harding and the tender, fragile and suicidal, Billy Bibbit &#x85; and of course, the Chief, who like us, is the witness of this dramedy. The Chief, whose growing friendship with McMurphy will lead to one of the most heartbreaking and noblest gestures, the most inspiring movie ending, sublimated by the scream of Christopher Lloyd as Taber.A sad ending foreseen by McMurphy in this unforgettable long close-up during the party scene, McMurphy probably figuring that this will end badly, that there's something so rotten in this world, it's better to enjoy the present without caring about tomorrow, the meaning of this close-up remains a mystery, even if the next scene brings some answer. But men like McMurphy are indispensable to prevent order from becoming an alienating force. And instead of being lobotomized by the obsessional psychological tyranny of being normal, anyone should be able to flee over his own cuckoo's nest.

","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"6 March 2011","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Looking at the gray screen, R.P. Mc Murphy comments an imaginary baseball game with such enthusiasm the images seem to come alive. All the inmates of the Mental Institution are laughing, cheering and shouting, while the head administrative Nurse, Mildred Ratched, asks for silence. But for one brief instant, they're free, and this freedom, as illusory as it is, has never been so palpable, it was freedom to challenge the authority, to transcend the limits of a blanked out TV set&#x85; this short but powerful moment perfectly illustrates the philosophy of Milos Forman's masterpiece One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. One of the all-time greatest films and most inspiring invitations to rebel against the tyranny of establishment.In fact, the greatness of the film exceeds the context of the story, but I think what makes it so impacting is the presence of a clear antagonism through the interactions between two polar opposite sides of human nature  order and rebellion. Order is represented by one of the most iconic and despicable cinematic villains ever Nurse Ratched, perfectly portrayed by Louise Fletcher. A woman, whose soft voice, cold eyes, and passive aggressive attitude is the incarnation of the cold tyranny of rules, as sterile and unproductive as they are. Doesn't this ring a bell? You know, where every thing must go the way it has always been, for no other reason than that the opposite reality would be dangerous. What deviates, what is different disturbs and must be brought back to the road, or eliminated. Fascism? Not so far. Anyway, this tyranny does have a castrating effect on the inmates, all males. And the liberation will come from the protagonist, R.P. Mc Murphy, Jack Nicholson at the peak of his career, playing his most inspiring and unforgettable role. McMurphy as the character who best defines Nicholson.McMurphy, with his inseparable beanie, malicious eyes, pornographic cards and foul-mouthed (body) language, is not just the hero of the film, he's also a tragic icon of New Hollywood, a wave that provided one of the greatest films of history. Almost a Christ-figure, this is a man who will sacrifice many opportunities to be free, in order to free other inmates from an unfair perception. From the dictatorship of a society that treats them as outcasts, as people who deserve to be domesticated, to repress their nature, if they want to become or to be considered as normal. This is the ultimate freedom, the one of the spirit, almost Nietschian to accept yourself instead of trying to be accepted by society, and screw society if she labels you as crazy. It's your freedom of thought and any form of thought is subversive. This defiance is taught by McMurphy as soon as he enters the lives of this world made of weird faces, funny attitudes, and unpredictable reactions, after discovering the masquerade. They are this way, because they're asked to follow some rules whose only purpose is to give a pseudo meaning to their lives, because life is supposed to be guided, to be punctuated with rituals and cycles, it's the lobotomizing effect of routine medication time, music, exercises, the so-called therapy where they have to share their problems, highlighting the true sadistic behavior of the Nurse. They don't even realize how alienated they are, and how this monotony will never solve anything but just keep them away from the rest of the world, maintaining a normality in microcosm.McMurphy breaks this routine, making Nurse Ratched his enemy. His free-spiritedness grows on the inmates who start talking, raising their hands, challenging the power the ultimate rebellious attitude. And another strength of the film is the ambiguity of McMurphy's character who might as well be perceived as a rebel who just want to make a mess, while Ratched is the one who tries to maintain some order. Those who label Ratched as fascist will probably face the pro-Ratched who'll consider McMurphy as an anarchist. But this is an intellectual debate while the movie deserves to be taken on a more emotional level to understand how Ratched is the true villain of the film. Her irresponsible sadistic behavior will provoke one of the saddest cinematic death, not because she deliberately wanted to kill but she was so coldly heartless, she didn't find another way to assess her power. She obviously regretted the act when it was too late, but she pushed the level of respect and obedience to the extreme, twisting the concept of order into dictatorship.One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is not about who's crazy or who's not, after all, before the fishing scene, didn't the inmates ironically look like doctors, especially the famous Dr. Scanlon?

Great acting, across the board, by the five main characters; but I don't understand why some people are complaining about TLW not being better known or more popular. Come on, you know why. Just picture it Mr. Guy comes home from work, Friday afternoon, and says to Mrs. Guy Honey, make yourself pretty and dress up, because tonite I'm taking you out to town for a romantic evening. First we'll go see a movie about a poor sap who just couldn't get off the bottle. Oh, BTW...there's a cool scene there, of a bat chomping up a mouse. Uhh, I don't really think Mr. Guy will be getting much love that night, and for that I'll have to blame his movie choice in first place. That's why TLW isn't much of a popular choice for the masses and why it will never be.But it is a very well done cinematographic work anyway. I have been watching lately, just by chance, some of Wilder's films and I got to say he's one of the true masters of American cinema. I saw now Double Indemnity and Ace in a Hole, apart from TLW, and what I find amazing about them all is how well they hold their own against any of today's productions despite the years past. Wilder's trademark seems to be that of well thought, smart, plots structured in a tight, wholesome, package played by well rounded, well defined characters, presented all with impeccable cinematography under his masterful direction--not one single superfluous or vacuous scene, image, line of dialog there; not one inch of footage needing to be cut. And the whole deal running at an overall pace that never lets up, that keeps you enthralled, even during the less intense segments, which make any of these films, even those dated because of their content, thoroughly modern&#x97;specially AIAH. And these are not just words. That scene I mentioned above, of the bat attacking the mouse, where all you can see is a little tail waging frantically and some blood running down the wall, is one of the most horrifying, blood curling, I have ever seen in a film. Or remember the image of Leo Minosa slowly dying in the coal mine, his face turning gradually black while the wild party goes on up there--another one that will haunt you for a long time. I think American Wilder fans should make an effort to let the young generation in their country to know better the work of this amazing filmmaker.Concerning TLW, the truly amazing thing is how the movie kept me captivated, even during a 2nd viewing, despite knowing already the end of the story. And after having wondered, when starting watching it, if I would still be there 10 min later. And you bet I was, and I was even for a 2nd viewing as said. I'll chalk that up to all what I have just mentioned, plus the superb acting job of everybody involved, added to the haunting, eerie, musical score--specially during the moments when Don starts retreating to his nightmarish, personal, hell--which some reviewers identified here as produced by a theremin, as they call it, while others talk about female high notes, which I think may be closer to the truth.I'm not an expert on the matter but it seems to me that in the main character here is really a mix of two different kinds of alcoholics. I have known a few, quite well, in my life and because of that I think Don is a composition rather than a stereotype. I have known what I call the more or less heavy drinker; the kind of guy who gets wasted two or three times a month, or every week when receiving his paycheck, but who is a responsible worker and a responsible father and husband. We all know someone like that. This guy usually drinks to forget about his frustrations, his failures, the kind for whom the line he drowns his sorrows in alcohol was invented. The other kind is the clinical alcoholic. That's the man who goes in binges that can last several days in a row and who's capable of robbing his own mother to finance his addiction. In his case, alcoholism is a disease, not a simple way to escape the unpleasantness of life, and some medical experts suggest that the causes for it may be deeper than a simple habit or the need to escape reality; even genetic roots for it are mentioned. In this movie, Don typically behaves like the second kind but when trying to explain the causes of his alcoholism he situates himself in the first category, that of a man frustrated by his own failures. If we believe what he's saying, he's not in any way a clinical case, as his drinking started with his failure as a writer so we may assume that, as soon as he gets professionally on the right path, his alcoholism will disappear or at least become more controllable. If we assume this being the case, then the happy end to the film doesn't appear that contrived or artificial. That's what I think also.Even if this is a rather dark, pessimistic film for most of its length; and even if the pure mention of is plot may be enough to dissuade many from wanting to see it, it's not by any means a boring or depressing one. I think most of the merit for that belongs, apart from Wilder's sure hand behind the camera, to the fantastic job Milland does with his character. His Don Birman is so likable, so touching, that it doesn't seem in any way forced or unrealistic the fact that people around him--Nat, Wick, Gloria, Helen--would go to such extent to help him and nurse him. This is one case where the Oscar for best actor surely fell in the good hands. 8\/10. ","genre":null},{"date":"6 March 2011","score":"","review":" Great movie.

I really love the original. Bogie-Bacall - what's not to love? However, that version does suffer from Hays Code puritanism that robbed the edge from much of human desires and sexual foibles that obviously suppressed some of the underlying desires and sexual motives.That's where the 1978 version excels - and fails. Let's start with the fails. In the original, the scenes in the bookshops near the beginning rule with Bogie's use of humour and the electric suggested tryst with Dorothy Malone's character.

But more of my thought later, here's a brief summary first (summary haters and those that don't wish to know anything about the plot please hide in that closet while I write the next paragraph).Young Jeffrey Beaumont comes across a human ear in a field near his home. Being a responsible type, he takes it to a policeman he knows, Detective Williams. The detective looks into the matter and later tells Jeffrey that he cannot discuss the case but he will tell him everything after the investigation. Jeffrey is not satisfied with this and is determined to find out more. Detective William's daughter, Sandy, tells Jeffery that she overheard her father say that a woman called Dorothy Vallens may be involved. The pair decides to try and find some evidence. Sneaking into her apartment and hiding in a closet, Jeffery discovers more than he bargained for when a violent and shady character called Frank Booth turns up. I will leave my short summary here&#x85; I think that's enough to intrigue you for now.A very well made film with some great moments and also some totally strange moments. I found it very compelling and also quite bizarre in places. Great performances all round, particularly from Dennis Hopper as Frank Booth; he really gets to chew all the scenery in this one! Also worthy of note is Isabella Rossellini as Dorothy Vallens, again, a stellar performance. Kyle MacLachlan was excellent as Jeffrey Beaumont, as was Laura Dern as Sandy Williams. I should also give an honourable mention to Dean Stockwell who I hardly recognised as Ben.As I've already said, this is a very compelling film with lots of quite strange and bizarre touches.

Regardless of this, Tita finds a way to consistently show her love for him by cooking and releasing her emotions into her food so that Pedro can feel them. The magical realism in this film is overwhelming. The viewer can almost experience all of Tita's emotions without even realizing it. When Tita cries into the fondant, she poisons the cake with the meaning of her tears and everyone who attended the wedding is also poisoned with this as well. It is remarkable that even though Mama Elena refuses to let Tita keep the roses from Pedro, something beautiful still came from the gift quail in rose petal sauce. This is irony at its best because the gift that was revered as ugly became something enjoyed. So powerful was this pleasure that even Gertrudis experiences this from the food. It is magical how all other characters in the movie feel the same hardships through the artfully prepared food, so magical that even the reader begins to feel it, too. The recipes are so illustrative in activating one's taste buds that the reader experiences everything the characters have felt the tears from the cake and the lust from the rose petal sauce. Possibly the reader should also suddenly become sick or burst into flames? To be honest, I wasn't sure if the love Tita and Pedro had for each other was puppy love or not. Of course, it is understandable that under the pressure from marrying Rosaura and from Mama Elena, desperate measures would be taken; however, I thought they would tire of each other. It seemed that Tita would actually marry Dr. John. He was certainly a sensible man and his love for Tita was endless and passionate.

Mauser and Pronter are some interesting villains as well as the gang around Zed while the was only Harris and two dumb heads in the first part. That's what makes this second part even slightly more interesting than the first one and equalizes the fact that some great characters have gone.Don't believe the harsh critics as the true downward spiral started far later than already in this movie.

Howard Hughes' picture isn't an MGM musical by any means. It's more a pageant, a parade of the exclusive, expensive and exotic. I think the key conceit is making Marilyn Monroe not just ditzy but plain stupid - she becomes the sink hole of desire into which men are easily sucked and takes the pressure off the real performance of the film, that of Jane Russell.The opportunity to see this film has come up due to the recent, unhappy news of Russell's death. I can see how this is a loss. A beautiful woman who can act, Russell can also sing (or appear to sing) and is also, manifestly, something of a pro - her 'fall' into the pool at the end of the Ain't There Anyone Here for Love? sequence was no fall but her being cracked in the back of the head with the knee of a diving man.Despite her irritating stoned-whisper delivery, it can't be denied that Monroe looks luminous on screen beside Russell and the women clearly have chemistry. No-one else comes near them, as an attraction of the film, although I liked Charles Coburn's turn as the lecherous diamond magnate Piggy.I think what I love above all about this and other films of this period is the wonderfully saturated colour and correspondingly hyper-present picture. The faces of the actresses are unreal but irresistible. Add to that one or two infectious song numbers - I absolutely loved Bye Bye Baby - and its a guaranteed hit. 6\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"6 March 2011","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" I lost count at about the eighth costume change.

No-one else comes near them, as an attraction of the film, although I liked Charles Coburn's turn as the lecherous diamond magnate Piggy.I think what I love above all about this and other films of this period is the wonderfully saturated colour and correspondingly hyper-present picture. The faces of the actresses are unreal but irresistible. Add to that one or two infectious song numbers - I absolutely loved Bye Bye Baby - and its a guaranteed hit. 6\/10 ","genre":"Comedy, Musical, Romance"},{"date":"6 March 2011","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" I lost count at about the eighth costume change. Howard Hughes' picture isn't an MGM musical by any means. It's more a pageant, a parade of the exclusive, expensive and exotic. I think the key conceit is making Marilyn Monroe not just ditzy but plain stupid - she becomes the sink hole of desire into which men are easily sucked and takes the pressure off the real performance of the film, that of Jane Russell.The opportunity to see this film has come up due to the recent, unhappy news of Russell's death.

Every time I watch this film I appreciate it more, and am beginning to see why it is regarded as a masterpiece by most critics and directors including Scorsese, Spielberg, and Lucas. The film should be regarded as a masterclass in cinematography. The title of the film also seems to have a dual meaning. Does it refer to the obvious search for Debbie, or for the search that takes place in Ethan's soul? So many little things occur that are subtle, like the relationship that is hinted at between Ethan and his brother's wife through visual clues only, which ends up helping to drive the story. The Searchers is a great film in every way, and its stature will continue to grow with time.
