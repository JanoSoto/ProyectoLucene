I immediately bought the movie (for $9.99 at Best Buy) and watched it again the next day.The plot is simple - two brothers, Norman Reedus and Sean Patrick Flannery, go on a killing spree with their friend, David DellaRocco. They vow to take out all the scum in their city (I believe a suburb of Boston or thereabouts, I could be wrong, haven't seen it since I bought it in August 2003). Willem Dafoe plays the homosexual, opera-loving, certifiably-insane, God-loving detective who is trying to track the case.The movie is intense. The confessional booth scene is amazing. When Dafoe enters the crime scene, I got chills. The action-sequences are fantastic (don't listen to those who hate the movie, they have nothing better to do). The dialogue isn't brilliant, but it's not fake-brilliance like some movies who want nothing more than to be Tarantino.The ending of the movie is amazing. One of the 5 best endings I've ever seen in a movie (you liked the ending of The Usual Suspects? that had nothing on Boondock Saints).

The idea was to show liberals as being well-intentioned yet mistaken in their methods.If they had done the film correctly, conservatives would be invited to supper, they would have explained real-world thinking to the liberals, and the liberals would have killed the conservatives simply because they could not grasp what mainstream America already embraces as its' philosophy. But, again, this would have taken the film in too far of a supportive perspective of conservatives and that's certainly not acceptable to the producers of this poorly conceived tripe.

When I saw the original, I was fully expecting the remake to kick some serious butt, and be far superior to the 1960s version. Why? Better visual effects being 2001 and all, one of my favorite actors in Tim Roth starring in it, and a great director named Tim Burton. Nothing could surely go wrong with Burton in the director's chair. Granted, I was never a huge fan of the POTA films, but seeing the potential here for a remake or revision by Burton made my mouth water. Then, in 2001, I got advance tickets and I began to watch one of the most anticipated movies for that year...I left the cinema very disappointed! Disappointment can cloud criticism though, and sometimes makes you bitter towards a movie and not see the positives. So I tried to look at the good. The make-up was excellent, but inconsistent in parts, but I still feel that area should have been nominated for an Oscar. Okay, that's good! Tim Roth was amazing in his performance but his character was not that great and seriously lacked depth. Helena Bonham Carter was also fairly decent in this film. And, finally some of the cinematography was fairly nice. What really let the remake of 'Planet of the Apes' down, was by in large, Tim Burton. This is, without a doubt, his worst film that I've seen! I cannot really compliment the direction of this movie, as it seemed self-aware and indulgent in being the remake. The script was awful, as well as the integration of one-liners from the original films to this new one. I groaned completely during Heston's cameo, particularly due the referrals to the original film. The remake should have been a film in its own right, and should have focused on creating a compelling story and universe, instead of opting for lame jokes revolving around Charlton Heston in ape make-up as Thade's father. The hero of the new film in Mark Whalberg was one-note, but he was given such a boring character who just went through the motions. Going to take a risk- check, gets sucked through a new dimension- check, captured by Apes- check, escape- check and so on and so on. I never felt anything for his character at all, and that was partly his performance and partly the woeful script\/direction. Estella Warren was awful, and Kris Kristofferson played the obligatory predictable role of the her father. Michael Clarke Duncan suited his part, but never became a well established character, and Paul Giamatti was okay as Limbo, but was obviously the comic relief. I also did not like the art direction was the Ape City, and found the original far more convincing in look and as a story.While, General Thade was certainly a memorable chimp because of Roth's performance, it's a shame the character was wasted in an extremely formulaic and cliche story! 'Planet of the Apes' (2001) is nowhere near the worst film of 2001, it certainly was the most disappointing for me, considering the potential it had with the dynamic vision of Tim Burton and the modern visual f\/x to create a film that stands out in its own right. It's just a pity Tim Burton chose to make a Hollywoodized self-aware gimmicky version that ends up being significantly inferior to the original film, instead of on par with it! And yes, Burton's 'Mars Attacks' is also better than his remake here! 'Planet of the Apes' gets a reluctant pass for Tim Roth's performance, the superb make-up and the decent cinematography, however that still doesn't save it from silly mediocrity.**½ out of *****!

Over the years, I have developed (if somewhat begrudgingly) an appreciation for this new crew and cast of players...and, while I still mourn the loss of the legends I loved, I look upon them as new neighbors, of sorts; with a certain measured withdrawn fondness.With the addition of an Emotion Chip, DATA is now an emotion-ridden, diseased AI personage, but in light of his not being able to grasp the concept of humor, he is willing to stake it all in his attempt to be more human.Also, this is the movie that first realized the potential we all knew was in the Enterprise, to separate into a saucer section and the remaining half of the ship. You could always look at the Enterprise and just knew that, Hey, there's kinda like a flying saucer on the top front half! But this movie actually did it. It marks a milestone in the series and in this line of movies. I also must say that the way they brought Kirk and Piccard together was sloppy and puerile. They both deserved better treatment and so did we, as fans. They did the best they could, I suppose, but in ignoring Nimoy's suggestions to counter the plot misconfigurations and obvious premise problems, I can honestly understand why Nimoy backed out of the director's chair and left it to someone else. Had they listened to him, this would have been a much better enterprise...pun intended.I love the movie, and enjoy it...now.

The movie itself was excellently done, and just as good as all the others, but the content just ... saddens me.With Sulu's daughter at the helm of the Enterprise-B, the crew of living legends accompanies a skeleton crew of trainees on a press blow out of a short jaunt, which turns into a distress call\/rescue mission which morphs into something very serious.Meet the Nexus; a ribbon of the time\/space continuum which has the ability to create and destroy anything in its path; to take it\/them to different whens and wheres.This is the unfortunate end of Kirk's reign as Captain of the Enterprise. He disappears into the Nexus and into an eternity of peace on his old Iowa farm. Or so it seems.I wanted him to die in battle. Be assassinated in his sleep. Anything noble. But instead, he was given a peaceful eternity. OK, fine. I have no choice but to deal with it. While I respect Piccard as Captain of the Enterprise, he will never be James Tiberius Kirk. But this is the end of the old series and the beginning of the new; hence the name Generations.

I admire it above all else for being able to do this.It strikes a chord that good sci-fi films have struck in the past. It gets down to the meaty bits, although sometimes the plot left me in the dark and the ending started to get a bit crazy, which lowered my overall pleasure regarding the film.

More people enter into the pit in an ill-fated attempt to rescue the boy, and they wind up being knocked unconscious (or put into a deep sleep) like the boy. The bodies are all transported to a hospital, and that same hospital later blows up after Scully (Gillian Anderson) and Mulder (David Duchovny) are unable to stop an implanted terrorist bomb from detonating inside a coke maching.But then Mulder is told by a mysterious man outside a bar (Martin Landau) that the bomb was never attempted to be defused. It was all an elaborate cover-up to hide the bodies of the pit victims. Mulder shrugs off the old man at first before he realizes that the man used to be a friend of his father's, and that he has some interesting true stories to tell.The X-Files intrigued me, kept me interested for the most part, and gave me a few good chill sequences, and yet I haven't seen a single full-length episode of the FOX TV show (only little tidbits here and there).

This annoying kid was in practically every movie during the early 1990's that Macauley Culkin was not in that required a child actor to ham it up big time...and that he does in this film.  Now, there are moments where the kids looks genuinely freaked out, by overall, in my opinion, the boy's horrible acting and unbelievably unrealistic stoic representation of a five year old kid really puts a damper on an overall really good story.  Seriously, every time I saw that kid on screen I really had to fight back guilty desires of Freddy going to town on him...but at any rate, the other actors work well, especially Wes Craven's cameo as himself.The script within a script idea along with having many of the original actors return was an excellent idea for this movie, and really makes it enjoyable to watch.  However, as a horror movie, it fails miserably.  I'm not saying it's not in the least bit scary, but few of the scares work because they are either lame, or retreading practically the same territory and setups we've seen in the other 6 Nightmare films.  At least that was my impression, I know others thought this movie was truly terrifying, and to each their own...but what could (and SHOULD have been) a truly terrifying movie with a 'real life' Freddy Kruger truly fails when it comes to horror. And it especially sucks considering that the story is so damn good.  It's basically like watching a drama more than a horror film which may be fine for most, but if you're expecting a horror movie, you may be in for a real disapointment.  With such a damn good script and great atmosphere, you would imagine Freddy would be twice as terrifying as before...unfortunately it is not so in this case.  Freddy is portrayed now as a bumbling, goofy, obviously SYNTHETIC (yes, his makeup here is the worst I've seen in the whole series, and that's saying a lot considering some of the sequels) and very weak being who really poses as no huge threat during any of the 'Freddy vs. Heather' scenes.  The scenes of Freddy's lair are impressive, but the 'special effects' used on him in these scenes are almost embarassing to watch.  Trust me, you'll know it when you see it.Overall though, not a bad movie.  As a horror film, it has a wonderful plot and for the most part, outstanding acting (which in itself, is a rarity), but for being a horror film, it fails miserably.  This is the confliction with 'New Nightmare'...it actually focuses on the story unlike most other horror films...yet, fails most of the time to deliver with the scares.  To further testimony this, I watched this with a few people who literally jump at any scary movie moment, and only jumped maybe twice the whole time.  At any rate, it is a pretty good movie and a nice attempt of Craven's to inject life into a dying series.  However, if you're looking to be scared out of your wits, you may need to go ahead and rerent the original.  7\/10 stars overall.

My older and advanced students read this book and then present me with a summary of it together with personal comments; this happens almost every year. Thus I think I may say that I am thoroughly acquainted with the story and its development in all aspects.I cannot help thinking that some previous reviewers of this film have either not read the novel, or were not paying enough attention whilst watching the film. However, there is one highly glaring omission in Peter Brook's film a hog's head was clamped onto a tall stick, but was never referred to in spoken words as being `the Lord of the Flies'. The fact that flies were then seen (and heard) buzzing around the hog's head can only lead one to presume that the visual message was considered enough in itself. There are other omissions and some strange changes to the novel. Firstly that the aeroplane carrying the kids ploughed into the jungle and did not flop down into the sea as in the film.So it was very nice - excuse me - seeing the boys at the beginning in nice white shirts and chorus gowns. Thankfully, as the boys grew into the surrounding jungle back-cloth, their attire changed ominously but correctly.Helped along by Raymond Leppard's `Kyrie' for boys' voices, and otherwise on instruments as well as tuned drums solo, conspiring with some spookyish black-and-white photography, the narrative goes through Golding's novel almost to the letter, thus making the small deviations and certain omissions all the more puzzling. This is by no means a criticism but an observation, as all `poetic license' of any kind has no hard and fast rules. However, I do think that 10 to 15 minutes added to the film might well have put right those niggling points.The boys were mostly between about 9 and 14 years of age, thus it is rather difficult, to say the least, to exact highly professional performances from these young actors. We get what could and should be expected and be grateful for it. My one grumble is that `Piggy' in the novel is cast as a little uncouth, with unpolished English, poor pronunciation and a fair amount of slang which does not have much to do with Camberley, Surrey, U.K. To my dismay, in the film `Piggy' seems to have received plentiful elocution practice. Tut, tut. My other little grumble is that in 1963 I think British film-makers could have run to a few more pennies and given us the visual glory of the beauty of wild Puerto Rican shores in full colour. I will concede that the use of colour might have diminished tension (or spookiness) in the telling of the story. `The Lord of The Flies' narrates, somewhat moralistically laden in the end, how a group of war-time British boys with inherited stiff-upper-lip social backgrounds can  quickly slide into savagery as supposed power of one kind or another takes a hold on them. Is it not the same in big power politics today on a globalised level? Yes ....... I can just see it Golding's hunters are the terrorist groups fighting against Bush, Blair, Putin, Aznar and so on. But, no my imagination is running away with me.An acceptable film but not very recommendable perhaps; I will not bother with the 1990 version. I will just lean back in my revolving chair, imitating an Oxford College don and recommend the novel.

However, there is one highly glaring omission in Peter Brook's film a hog's head was clamped onto a tall stick, but was never referred to in spoken words as being `the Lord of the Flies'. The fact that flies were then seen (and heard) buzzing around the hog's head can only lead one to presume that the visual message was considered enough in itself. There are other omissions and some strange changes to the novel.
