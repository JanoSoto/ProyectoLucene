It's not just a war movie and it's not just a film about simple life. It's a balanced story made to compare and contrast the people's lives surrounding the Vietnam War and the consequences of war itself in the eyes and emotions of the people involved. I simply love De Niro in this film. He displays a range of emotion that his characters usually don't allow for him to portray...yet he remains the tough guy. Any De Niro fan owes it to themselves to watch this heart-wrenching epic. One of my favorite De Niro performances. Christopher Walken and Merryl Streep also create some remarkable performances in their own right.Some will think this film is slow or is too long. Kill yourself now as you entirely missed the point of this work of art and are of no importance to society. You have no attention span worthy of forming any relevant opinion and all reviews given by you shall be deemed as wasted server space. With that out of the way, I will admit that this movie is long but I feel that it works for the movie and not against it. It's meant to establish the characters and their relations to each other in the beginning and to set up that bond between the main characters before they're off to war, which is complimented in the post-war scenes. To get the true effect of contrast to work properly, you must be able to get used to and care for the characters and their environment before throwing them into battle. I will even go as far to say that I thought the beginning was dragging myself, but then completely reversed that opinion once the post-war scenes came along. It's necessary, and is one of the reasons I like this film so much.The simple realistic ways that people interact together in the film makes it very believable...it is very much how life would be if these characters existed and were in such a situation. The acting performances are definitely enhanced by the wonderfully written script and dialog. They're all completely realistic and believable as they should be.For war film buffs, there is a scene in this movie that will blow you away, literally. The whole Vietnam part of the film is completely brutal and harsh, even compared to most war epics. Some of the images are quite disturbing, but it's war, that's life. One scene in particular when they're in Vietnam will stay with me forever as one of the most intense scenes I have ever seen depicted on screen. Watch it and you will know exactly what I'm talking about. Great stuff.The ending is tragic and sad, but completely suiting to the rest of the film.

I will admit this right up front and unashamedly.  I cannot stand gory movies; they scare me, make me sick, give me nightmares, you name it.  It was with great reluctance that I agreed to watch this movie with my boyfriend, who had seen it before and was very good about telling me when to look away from the screen.  So, I did not see the opening acid-crucifixion scene, (though I heard the screams, splashing and sizzling sounds) I did not see the tarantula scene, (yeah, I'm arachnophobic too, sue me!) and I did not see the eyeball-on-a-spike scene.  So why, exactly, am I reviewing this film when I didn't even see the most important parts?  Well, I'll tell you...This film, like all of Fulci's most notorious films, relies very heavily on explicit, in your face, gross-out gore, and the more realistic the better.  But what about the actual film?  You know, the plot, the storyline, the actors, all that other stuff?  Having NOT been overwhelmed by graphic mutilations and sadistic torture deaths, I can honestly say that The Beyond was quite spooky.  There were some lovely shots of humid, night time New Orleans and the brooding hotel which stands atop one of the gateways to Hell.  The music was wonderfully eerie and the shots of the dark, flooded basement with its icky, crumbling walls really made me shiver and long for a hot bath.  This movie really has some great creepy moodiness going for it I mean, it would have freaked me out even without the gore.  The plot doesn't always make sense, but really, who can say what may make sense when the doorways to Hell are opened?

This film really gets under your skin.The shot of the Seven Doors, illuminated from within and filled with shuffling zombies, the creepy woman with the egg-white blind eyes, the rotting army of zombies slowly lurching down every corridor, the little girl whose head literally explodes and the wonderful gun-loading scene in the elevator where our heroine comes within an inch of cracking up on camera - all of these make this film well worth watching.

But can it translate well into a good film? After watching films like Sphere (based on the Michael Crighton novel by the same name) and Queen of the Damned (based on the Anne Rice novel) and after enduring all the films loosely based on Dean R. Koontz's great novels, I can say I wasn't expecting much out of Bourne Identity. Fortunately Bourne Identity proves that not all films taken out of grandiose novels turn out to be mediocre entertainment.  In the novel, the terrorist Carlos is the enemy.

Even in 1964 many professional experts overlooked it. 'LES PARAPLUIS' STARTED AN ENTIRELY NEW GENRE, viz. THE FILM MUSICAL. Without any exception, the music of every previous musical was created with the aim of functioning appropriately in the theatre. By contrast, in 'Les parapluis' the team of the director (Jacques Demy) and the composer (Michel Legrand) for the first time decided to produce a work in which the sound should be 100% film music. No one had previously attempted such a task. - This innovation may seem less conspicuous today, because theatre musicals and cinema musicals have reciprocally learned from each other. But note! Even though some musical techniques and phenomena may function well in both the theatre and the cinema, this is by no means true of all techniques and phenomena. - Today it is no revolutionary view that 'West Side Story' and 'Les parapluis' belong to the ten best musicals ever made for the screen. But Swedish reviewers in the 1960s had limited musical competence. Leonard Bernstein's contribution to the former movie was called 'a heap of banal hits', and the latter movie was depreciated as 'a sugary Hollywood melodrama'. - It is definitely not my intention to belittle the non-musical merits of the movie. Even if all music had been deleted, I would still consider it a great movie. Nevertheless, I asked myself whether the music of any other film is of a comparable quality, while being at the same time congenial with the action and situations. I think there is one and only one rival, viz. 'Phaedra' by Jules Dassin, with music by Mikis Theodorakis. However, in 'Les parapluis' all music reaches the highest quality, from the first to the last note. In 'Phaedra' the same thing is true of at most two tunes, among them the love theme. - The DVD version is 31 seconds shorter than the cinema and the video versions the penultimate 31 seconds have been cut away to ensure that the picture and the music should finish at exactly the same time. It would be vainly to complain about such re-editing. However, the technique with a rotating playback-and-record-head has existed since forty years. If this technique had been applied, the cut would not have been annoying to musicians. But most regrettably, the cut is performed with ordinary scissors. - Users who do not love music, or not this kind of music, would more often than not be disappointed by this movie (although not necessarily so). - The action is very simple. Guy and Geneviève love each other. He is a motor mechanic, and she works in her mother's umbrella shop. When he is enlisted and sent to the North African colonies, she is pregnant. Continual war activity makes it difficult for him to write many letters. Geneviève's mother is worried about her pregnancy. Her pressure eventually makes Geneviève marry a jeweller, whose love may well be as sincere as Guy's. But we are not told whether Geneviève feels more than gratitude because he saves her from becoming an unmarried mother. - When Guy returns from the war and Geneviève has left the town, he becomes very depressed. But he eventually marries the nurse who had for years taken care of his godmother. All the time she had secretly been in love with Guy. - After some years Guy and Geneviève accidentally meet again, but nothing much happen at this meeting. - What so many people admire is the moods and the atmosphere of each scene; not least the transparency and depth of the emotions of the persons.

What a piece of tripe this is. I have no idea what the folks who rated it highly were smoking, but it is surely one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time.The concept is insultingly bad. A kid working as a janitor solves a highly sophisticated math problem? And not just any old college, no. It has to be M.I.T.  Yep, I'm sure that happens every so often. From this brilliant premise the movie goes rapidly downhill. Violence, ubiquitous cursing, infatuation with cigarette smoking, social ineptness - ah, the life of the troubled-yet-brilliant youth. How many movies like this have been made? I found the acting to be smarmy. Cocky and irrelevant, just like the characters, the plot, the writing - the whole movie. It keeps trying to put on the Hollywood-haughty airs and tries to pass itself off as something special. In fact, there's no point at all. You don't care about the kid; he's just either too sharp or too weak, and he can slip between either of them. With all these fake antics you finally just give up even caring the slightest bit.

","genre":"Action, Horror, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"30 January 2004","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":"  I recall how when this film first came out, it generated a lot of controversy. Being a devout Christian, I can easily see how it can offend someone, particularly if that person wishes to be offended. It not only uses the story of Christ as the basis for absurd comedy, it also alludes to a number of offbeat, and some would say sacrilegious theories about Christ (e.g., His mother Mary being raped by a Roman soldier, Mary Magdalene being His wife\/lover). In fairness, however, the story clearly makes the point in the prologue scene that the character Brian is not Christ, if that should satisfy anyone.Make no mistake- this film is a funny one. There are two scenes in particular that are absolutely hilarious. The first is the stoning scene, which I remember had upset some Jewish groups when this film was first released because of its repeated use of the word `Jehovah'. The second is when Brian is brought before a Pontius Pilate with a speech impediment, a role played with hysterically comic mercilessness by Michael Palin. I also liked the `What have the Romans ever done for us?' scene, and several others.But the film is flawed, too. For one thing, the actors often go too heavy on the British accents, to the point where many lines are inaudible and many jokes are lost, at least to American ears. The Jones character (as the mother) starts to grate on you after a while, though he has some funny lines and moments. The Terry Gilliam graphics, which were amusingly employed in The Holy Grail, don't fit in this story. The only thing that came to my mind when Brian was scooped up by that alien space ship was the theory promulgated in the early 70s by author Erik Von Daniken that many miraculous events discussed in the Bible were actually descriptions of encounters with extraterrestrial beings. Was that the point of this scene? If not, then what was the joke here?Like in The Holy Grail, the troupe seems to have trouble finding a suitable ending for this film, although the ending for The Holy Grail was better than the ending here. While I am hard pressed to imagine how they could have suitably closed a story based on the life of Christ, a light ditty sung by a crucified chorus just isn't funny. I once saw an interview with Cleese who said that the point they were making in this scene was that maybe death isn't such a bad thing. I guess that comes through, but the scene doesn't work for me. But I can also see why they stopped the story where they did &#150; making jokes about the crucifixion is bad enough; jokes about the resurrection would have gone too far in many quarters.Yet in spite of these flaws, this is still a movie worth seeing. The extremely talented Chapman, Cleese, Palin, Idle, Jones and Gilliam, who adopted numerous roles in The Holy Grail, take on just as many, if not more, roles in this film. There are a number of perceptive story lines and gags injected into this story (e.g., the smoldering rivalry between the seemingly allied `People's Front of Judea' and the `Judean People's Front' guerilla groups). And the Tunisian sets ironically makes this one of the more accurate depictions of the Biblical era, as did The Holy Grail in its depiction of the filthy, disease ridden Middle Ages. All in all, The Life of Brian is worth a rainy\/snowy Saturday afternoon viewing.

The first is the stoning scene, which I remember had upset some Jewish groups when this film was first released because of its repeated use of the word `Jehovah'. The second is when Brian is brought before a Pontius Pilate with a speech impediment, a role played with hysterically comic mercilessness by Michael Palin. I also liked the `What have the Romans ever done for us?' scene, and several others.But the film is flawed, too. For one thing, the actors often go too heavy on the British accents, to the point where many lines are inaudible and many jokes are lost, at least to American ears. The Jones character (as the mother) starts to grate on you after a while, though he has some funny lines and moments. The Terry Gilliam graphics, which were amusingly employed in The Holy Grail, don't fit in this story. The only thing that came to my mind when Brian was scooped up by that alien space ship was the theory promulgated in the early 70s by author Erik Von Daniken that many miraculous events discussed in the Bible were actually descriptions of encounters with extraterrestrial beings. Was that the point of this scene? If not, then what was the joke here?Like in The Holy Grail, the troupe seems to have trouble finding a suitable ending for this film, although the ending for The Holy Grail was better than the ending here. While I am hard pressed to imagine how they could have suitably closed a story based on the life of Christ, a light ditty sung by a crucified chorus just isn't funny. I once saw an interview with Cleese who said that the point they were making in this scene was that maybe death isn't such a bad thing. I guess that comes through, but the scene doesn't work for me. But I can also see why they stopped the story where they did &#150; making jokes about the crucifixion is bad enough; jokes about the resurrection would have gone too far in many quarters.Yet in spite of these flaws, this is still a movie worth seeing. The extremely talented Chapman, Cleese, Palin, Idle, Jones and Gilliam, who adopted numerous roles in The Holy Grail, take on just as many, if not more, roles in this film. There are a number of perceptive story lines and gags injected into this story (e.g., the smoldering rivalry between the seemingly allied `People's Front of Judea' and the `Judean People's Front' guerilla groups). And the Tunisian sets ironically makes this one of the more accurate depictions of the Biblical era, as did The Holy Grail in its depiction of the filthy, disease ridden Middle Ages. All in all, The Life of Brian is worth a rainy\/snowy Saturday afternoon viewing.

Being a devout Christian, I can easily see how it can offend someone, particularly if that person wishes to be offended. It not only uses the story of Christ as the basis for absurd comedy, it also alludes to a number of offbeat, and some would say sacrilegious theories about Christ (e.g., His mother Mary being raped by a Roman soldier, Mary Magdalene being His wife\/lover).

Dude, Where's My Car came out in 2000 heralding a new golden age in cinema.  I can hardly believe that it has taken three and a half years to finally make it to my DVD collection.  It stands proudly next to the Godfather, Shawshank Redemption, and the like.   I am glad that I am now able to review this movie and give it the attention that it truly deserves.This movie works on so many levels and I hope that I am able to touch on a few of the themes.  The movie starts off with Jesse and Chester waking up from a killer party the night before.  Jesse is portrayed by Ashton Kutcher of `That 70's Show' fame and with this movie proves his versatility as an actor.  It may surprise some of you that he was not given an Oscar nod for his portrayal of the hapless but lovable Jesse.  Seann William Scott, the lovable but rude jock from the American Pie trilogy, is able to shine as the cable TV saturated, stoned Chester.  While at first glance he seems to represent the wasted MTV generation stuck behind the boob tube without any ambition for furthering his own goals or being productive in society, we eventually learn that there is more to this man-child that meets the eye. Chester has a large role in finding Jesse's car and (spoiler) saving the universe.The Twins call Jesse and Chester's place to remind them of their anniversary and to inform them that they trashed their place.  So Jesse and Chester go to find the car to get to the twin's house and give them their anniversary gifts.  Unfortunately, Jesse's car is missing and the story is set into motion.  They realize that they have no memories of the night before. Their epic quest begins by seeking a great sage, Nelson that might be able find their lost memories.  Nelson is truly a Zen master but is unable to jog either Jesse or Chester's memory.  Instead, they go to a Chinese restaurant where they find their first obstacle, a psychic duel between Jesse and the lady behind the take-out counter.  Dude, Where's My Car boldly takes head on the taboo subject of racial and society differences.  No racial stereotype is off limits in this film.  Jesse's banter with the over the counter lady is reminiscent of the dialogue between Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan in When Harry Met Sally.  But instead of touching upon the theme of male-female relations, we learn how difficult it can be to get an order of Chinese take out.  This banter turns out to be too much for our hero Jesse and he is left with only one recourse, physical violence.  So Jesse and Chester are left without take out and without their sage, Nelson.  All hope seems lost when a clue to their previous night approaches.  It is Christie Boner.  She gives them more clues of their missing time.  Unfortunately, for the two protagonists, it is not long before her jock boyfriend, Tommy arrives. The character Tommy may at first seem like an over the top stereotype, but by the end of the film we see his different subtle shades (`stoner bashing time' vs. `nerd bashing time') and different emotions.Like Alice in Wonderland, the more they look for the car, the further down the rabbit hole they go and further away their goal seems.  They find that they have been to a strip bar in league with a trans-gender stripper, outwitted aliens posing as Hot Chicks, ambiguously gay Nordic aliens, culties, law enforcement officers, and a tailor.  Each step of the way they are given a small hint of the night before and one step closer to the car. It seems that the mystery of the location of their car is wrapped in intergalactic intrigue.  Not only is Jesse's car missing, but so is the Continuum Transfunctioner, whose power is only matched by it's mystery.After a series of adventures, they find Jesse' car is sold to some unsavory character and the film comes to one of it's high points.  They end up at an osterage farm.  This scene is very reminiscent of the raptor escape scene from one (or any) of the Jurassic Park films, except a little better.  The true danger is not the large birds, but the farmer himself played by Star Trek's Data, Brent Spiner as Pierre.  Another great cameo is Andy Dick as Marc, the poacher.   When Jesse and Chester's fate looks most grim, it is Chester's battle of wits, and extensive television watching, that saves the day.  I am glad that the makers of this film took the angle that watching countless hours of television is not automatically bad and could come in handy if ever caught by a French mad-man.   Unfortunately for Jesse and Chester, the two are no closer to their prize, but this scene sets up the climax of the movie.The final act takes place at a miniature golf park.  They call all the interested parties; Tommy and the Jocks who have the sage Nelson captured, the culties lead by Zartan who have captured the twins, the Nordic aliens claiming to be the Guardians of the Continuum Transfunctioner, their boss Mr. Pizzacoli, and of course, Hot Chicks.  Again, I don't want to spoil it for those who have not seen it, but the film works out in a brilliant way. We see the true friendship between Jesse and Chester.   It reminds me of the developed relationship of Samwise and Frodo.  What is more amazing is that while the Lord of the Rings movies totaled over 9 hours, we get the same level of companionship in a brisk 90 minutes.  We also see that love will prevail, nay, must prevail.  If I have one complaint about the movie is that the Guardians of the Continuum Transfunctioner too easily succumb to the Giant Alien Babe.  I feel that the Guardians would be a formidable opponent not only by their name, keen euro-fashion sense, but also by their very fit build. I can only hope that there was an extended battle scene that did not make it to the final theatrical release.  It is my wish that the director will have an Extended Edition like Peter Jackson and his Lord of the Ring Trilogy, but I find this extremely unlikely.You will most certainly catch me at the midnight showing of Seriously Dude, Where's My Car, the next installment to Dude, Where's My Car story.  I have some inside scoop that this is a major green light!  I heard that the original concept of the Dude saga was to be a trilogy.  I am happy to hear that the studio has already started making the second chapter and I am hoping that it will be profitable enough to make Really, Seriously, Dude, Where's My Car!?! so that we, the public,  will be able to see the Dude story arc in it's entirety.For rich dialogue, multiple themes, brave innovative movie making, and disregarding political correctness, I  highly recommend this film.

I am glad that I am now able to review this movie and give it the attention that it truly deserves.This movie works on so many levels and I hope that I am able to touch on a few of the themes.  The movie starts off with Jesse and Chester waking up from a killer party the night before.  Jesse is portrayed by Ashton Kutcher of `That 70's Show' fame and with this movie proves his versatility as an actor.  It may surprise some of you that he was not given an Oscar nod for his portrayal of the hapless but lovable Jesse.  Seann William Scott, the lovable but rude jock from the American Pie trilogy, is able to shine as the cable TV saturated, stoned Chester.  While at first glance he seems to represent the wasted MTV generation stuck behind the boob tube without any ambition for furthering his own goals or being productive in society, we eventually learn that there is more to this man-child that meets the eye. Chester has a large role in finding Jesse's car and (spoiler) saving the universe.The Twins call Jesse and Chester's place to remind them of their anniversary and to inform them that they trashed their place.  So Jesse and Chester go to find the car to get to the twin's house and give them their anniversary gifts.  Unfortunately, Jesse's car is missing and the story is set into motion.  They realize that they have no memories of the night before. Their epic quest begins by seeking a great sage, Nelson that might be able find their lost memories.  Nelson is truly a Zen master but is unable to jog either Jesse or Chester's memory.  Instead, they go to a Chinese restaurant where they find their first obstacle, a psychic duel between Jesse and the lady behind the take-out counter.  Dude, Where's My Car boldly takes head on the taboo subject of racial and society differences.  No racial stereotype is off limits in this film.  Jesse's banter with the over the counter lady is reminiscent of the dialogue between Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan in When Harry Met Sally.  But instead of touching upon the theme of male-female relations, we learn how difficult it can be to get an order of Chinese take out.  This banter turns out to be too much for our hero Jesse and he is left with only one recourse, physical violence.  So Jesse and Chester are left without take out and without their sage, Nelson.  All hope seems lost when a clue to their previous night approaches.  It is Christie Boner.  She gives them more clues of their missing time.  Unfortunately, for the two protagonists, it is not long before her jock boyfriend, Tommy arrives. The character Tommy may at first seem like an over the top stereotype, but by the end of the film we see his different subtle shades (`stoner bashing time' vs. `nerd bashing time') and different emotions.Like Alice in Wonderland, the more they look for the car, the further down the rabbit hole they go and further away their goal seems.  They find that they have been to a strip bar in league with a trans-gender stripper, outwitted aliens posing as Hot Chicks, ambiguously gay Nordic aliens, culties, law enforcement officers, and a tailor.  Each step of the way they are given a small hint of the night before and one step closer to the car. It seems that the mystery of the location of their car is wrapped in intergalactic intrigue.  Not only is Jesse's car missing, but so is the Continuum Transfunctioner, whose power is only matched by it's mystery.After a series of adventures, they find Jesse' car is sold to some unsavory character and the film comes to one of it's high points.  They end up at an osterage farm.  This scene is very reminiscent of the raptor escape scene from one (or any) of the Jurassic Park films, except a little better.  The true danger is not the large birds, but the farmer himself played by Star Trek's Data, Brent Spiner as Pierre.  Another great cameo is Andy Dick as Marc, the poacher.   When Jesse and Chester's fate looks most grim, it is Chester's battle of wits, and extensive television watching, that saves the day.  I am glad that the makers of this film took the angle that watching countless hours of television is not automatically bad and could come in handy if ever caught by a French mad-man.   Unfortunately for Jesse and Chester, the two are no closer to their prize, but this scene sets up the climax of the movie.The final act takes place at a miniature golf park.  They call all the interested parties; Tommy and the Jocks who have the sage Nelson captured, the culties lead by Zartan who have captured the twins, the Nordic aliens claiming to be the Guardians of the Continuum Transfunctioner, their boss Mr. Pizzacoli, and of course, Hot Chicks.  Again, I don't want to spoil it for those who have not seen it, but the film works out in a brilliant way. We see the true friendship between Jesse and Chester.   It reminds me of the developed relationship of Samwise and Frodo.  What is more amazing is that while the Lord of the Rings movies totaled over 9 hours, we get the same level of companionship in a brisk 90 minutes.  We also see that love will prevail, nay, must prevail.  If I have one complaint about the movie is that the Guardians of the Continuum Transfunctioner too easily succumb to the Giant Alien Babe.  I feel that the Guardians would be a formidable opponent not only by their name, keen euro-fashion sense, but also by their very fit build. I can only hope that there was an extended battle scene that did not make it to the final theatrical release.  It is my wish that the director will have an Extended Edition like Peter Jackson and his Lord of the Ring Trilogy, but I find this extremely unlikely.You will most certainly catch me at the midnight showing of Seriously Dude, Where's My Car, the next installment to Dude, Where's My Car story.  I have some inside scoop that this is a major green light!  I heard that the original concept of the Dude saga was to be a trilogy.  I am happy to hear that the studio has already started making the second chapter and I am hoping that it will be profitable enough to make Really, Seriously, Dude, Where's My Car!?! so that we, the public,  will be able to see the Dude story arc in it's entirety.For rich dialogue, multiple themes, brave innovative movie making, and disregarding political correctness, I  highly recommend this film.  This film stands up to multiple viewings and gets better every time it's watched.9.5 out of 10  ","genre":"Comedy, Mystery"},{"date":"30 January 2004","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  Dude, Where's my Car is a cinematic achievement that will no doubt steer the motion picture industry of this decade (and perhaps the entire century) toward a new height.
