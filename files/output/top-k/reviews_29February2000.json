This guy already is beginning to have cult-like fan following and it seems that he's just getting started.  He's starred in 12 movies in the past 3 years and has 3 more slated for release this year alone.  Not only does he act, but he's one of those Hollywood, actors, producers, director's, etc.  With and Oscar and Golden Globe for writing Good Will Hunting and directing a movie called I Killed My Lesbian Wife, Hung Her on a Meat Hook, and Now I Have a Three-Picture Deal at Disney a couple of years earlier he is poising himself to become one the next film legends. Reindeer Games is one of those movies that no matter how good you think you are at figuring movies out, if you get the ending right you're just plain lucky.  It is also the kind where if you know the ending before you see it, a good part of the movie is ruined. Affleck adds another great performance to his resume.  It's kind of hard to see him in an die-hard honest-to-God action movie.  Typically these are left to likes of Arnold, Sly, and Bruce Willis.  John Frankenheimer helps out a little in this area, because unlike many action movies of late there isn't an exploding vehicle or AK-47 firing of every 40 seconds.  Don't get me wrong, there are explosions and automatic gunfire, but it's used more sparingly and adds to the story.  The effects, nudity, and macho-ness are not present just for the sake of being there. I think Affleck and Charlize Theron made a great duo.  Her career skyrocketed with The Devil's Advocate in 1997.  She plays her part superbly as well. Many will disagree with me on this part, but I think Gary Sinise is who mad this film good.  He  plays Gabriel, the moronic villain.  This guy is mean enough to shoot an ice fisherman while in his hut, but dumb enough to believe Rudy's lies.  Dumb and mean not the best combination.  Sinise pulls it off nicely.  I think he just one of those guys that can play a multitude of parts well. Reindeer Games is a great guy movie, and a good action-comedy.  It's not a chick-flick, but I don't see any reason everyone can't get some enjoyment from it.

Everything in it, the acting, the photography, the cast, the background music everything was as close to perfection as any movie I've ever seen. And of course the plot - I've never seen anything that even comes close.It's about a Man whose wife just left him to go find herself. It's about his career, about his marriage (that he probably took for granted) and his son.It's about a woman who has just left her husband and her son to go find herself. To figure out who she is (independent of being a wife and a mother). And it is about her son whom she loves dearly.It's about a little boy whose mother has just left him and whose father is not really prepared to be his father and his mother though his father loves him very much.But mostly it's about a man his son trying to get on with their lives without the person who had kept it all glued together. It's about the father learning to make french-toast, it's about the son learning mommys sometime go away even though it was nothing that he did. It's about learning that some things are more important than your career.

It was just a bad movie, overrated and stupid and a waste of time.  But upon further thought, I realised the film did exactly what it was supposed to.  It showed how the world can be a weird and horrible place, and how this young man who goes around torturing people and being a wicked person ultimately doesn't have to pay for what he does.  And it's funny too. So this film brilliantly satirises this world, showcasing pure evil and people who ordinarily do not perform such evil are forced to laugh and observe what we all hate to admit is the truth.  It's sick, but at the same time brilliant.  And when one gets down to the core, you can't really explain it.  It just is what it is.  It's real.  No one really sees it very often, but it is out there and everyone knows.  And no one does anything about it.

Movies have always been a true love for me, but it wasn't until this film challenged me that I fell deeply in love.  The first viewing left me speechless, unable to describe how weird and terrible I felt.  I thought it was the film that left me in this mood, so of course that was the easy target to blame.  It was just a bad movie, overrated and stupid and a waste of time.  But upon further thought, I realised the film did exactly what it was supposed to.  It showed how the world can be a weird and horrible place, and how this young man who goes around torturing people and being a wicked person ultimately doesn't have to pay for what he does.  And it's funny too. So this film brilliantly satirises this world, showcasing pure evil and people who ordinarily do not perform such evil are forced to laugh and observe what we all hate to admit is the truth.  It's sick, but at the same time brilliant.  And when one gets down to the core, you can't really explain it.  It just is what it is.  It's real.  No one really sees it very often, but it is out there and everyone knows.  And no one does anything about it.  In essence, A Clockwork Orange is the ultimate satire, and one of the ultimate film experiences.  It's art, it's life, and in a funky way, it's entertaining.

But the mistake in his career will always be The Cable Guy, even though it is possible his best performance to date, and one of the funniest movies ever made.  It need not be said that I stand alone in this opinion, for most people thought it was bad.  But if people sat down to watch it again, I think they may see something they missed.  People expected it to be a wacky Ace Ventura-esque comedy, with plenty of poop and sex jokes.  But instead they got a smart dark comedy, which threw their minds for a loop.  First at the core is the bravura performance by Carrey.  For the first time (pre- Truman Show)  he created a character.  His acting had evolved and he was more than just a big screen version of his In Living Colour  persona.  Don't get me wrong, the first Ace Ventura is still very funny, but The Cable Guy  has such a sharp edge to it that it is a thousand times more hilarious.  A common blame is the script, but even if it was a little weak, which really it isn't, Carrey certainly saves it, as does director Ben Stiller.  He throws many of his social jabs in the film, ala his television show.  Mainly the tv movie in the film based on the twin brothers who had a falling out.  One killed the other, and Eric Roberts stars as both characters.   That is just a small portion of all the pop culture mocking that takes place.  Carrey's character Chip  is loaded with television and movie references, a true product of the American babysitter  television.  Back to Carrey, his Chip  has so many layers that the viewer can never understand who he truly is, which is the key to the film.  He is an amalgam of characters throughout media history, and Carrey takes little bits from so many and creates such a complex man that one can't help but be horrified and heart-broken.  He seems truly crazy, but also he's just a lonely guy who needs a little compassion. Most importantly, he's hilarious.  Who knows, there probably won't be many people who will watch it again, but they are truly missing something great. It's dark and zany at the same time, and certainly not stupid.  Maybe being a product of television I can relate more, or maybe I'm just insane.

To me, this movie felt longer than either Magnolia or The Green Mile, both of                               which are a full 3\/4 of an hour longer. But, the primary reason this movie is so                               bad is that it has a really poor choice of character focus. Someone like Tom                               Ripley, a figure whose past is shrouded in mystery - even for the audience, fits a                               secondary role much better than a leading one. In the entire film, the only thing                               we learn about Ripley, other than the fact that he's good at pretending to be other                               people, is the nature of his sexual orientation.

It's interesting watching these fictional characters rub elbows with history like John Jacob Astor, Molly Brown, Benjamen Guggenheim, etc.  I am a huge Titanic buff and certainly enjoyed this movie.  A movie theater in my area had it on until the day it came out on video.  Of course, I was going to be in line at Suncoast Pictures in my local Mall for my copy the day it came out but three days before it came out, I had to go back and see it on the big screen one more time because it was so impressive and so realistic.  I felt like I was there, really there.  This is definately one of my favorite movies!
