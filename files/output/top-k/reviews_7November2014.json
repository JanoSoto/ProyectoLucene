But what if it was your own genetic traits you were judged by? Gattaca explores a world where the human race is perfect in every way thanks to genetic alteration, and where the naturally born, imperfect ones, are left without hopes and dreams from the moment they are born.Vincent is a child who beats the odds, naturally born and with a heart condition and possible ADHD. His brother, genetically altered to be perfect, leaves his parents often forgetting Vincent's existence, and trampling his dream of space travel. Then one day, a genetically perfect but suicidal and confused man, Jerome, gives Vincent a chance. The problem is, despite the extensive lengths Vincent takes to become Jerome aren't stopping detectives from getting closer and closer to the truth.I saw Gattaca during a class unit on social identity and I have to say it was a really amazing movie! The characters are very complex, from Irene (a woman who appears perfect but in fact has a minor heart condition that prevents her from most space travel) to Jerome (seemingly perfect but suffering far more than the imperfect Vincent is). Strangely enough, designer babies is getting closer and closer to becoming a reality, which I find disturbing and wrong. Not to mention it's selfish, just because a parent wants their baby to look like Dakota Fanning or Justin Bieber or to not have health issues does not mean that tampering with a child's life is worth it. Modern parents honestly need to wake up, as do scientists, the topic might seem like a trend now but messing with human DNA to create perfect children, especially when there are so many adoptable children in the world in need of caring parents... ugh, there are times when science should not advance and this is one of those times! Gattaca also points out that anything is possible. Vincent proves that having physical\/mental disabilities can't stop us from achieving our dreams, and that if we listen to society maybe we'll miss out on finding our real talents. Six years ago after failing math and being diagnosed with depression, fibromyalgia and asperger's syndrome, I highly doubted I'd ever be like other people and I gave up on my dream of publishing fiction novels. Well, after seeing Gattaca I ended up writing a novel and now I've got several published books. We all have talents, regardless of outside factors.highly recommend Gattaca, with its wonderful soundtrack, creative characters and eye-opening story, it's a movie we all need to see. It reminded me of Martin L. King's I Have A Dream speech, and hopefully we can all learn from it. We as humans have the scientific technology for sending the whole world into a nuclear holocaust, and the power to force everyone to conform to environmentalism without input from factories and corporations. The technology to clone and alter humans is out there. The difference is that we don't do these things, because if we did, not only would we be causing irreversible changes to society, we'd be losing our legacy as a human race within our own mistakes.I also recommend you watch Never Let Me Go (2010) and Village of the Damned (1995) along with Gattaca.

S. Anderson isn't that bad. Mortal Kombat incorporates a lot of elements from the series' first two games into its plot. Unlike the Street Fighter movie, product a year earlier, this movie has an underground fighting tournament. It's here, that Shaolin warrior Liu Kang (Robin Shou), U.S. Special Forces agent Sonya Blade (Bridgette Wilson), and Hollywood superstar Johnny Cage (Linden Ashby) meet each other. Handpicked by Raiden (Christopher Lambert), the god of lightning and defender of the Earth realm; the three mortals must travel to an uncharted island to overcome their powerful adversaries in order to prevent Outworld, an evil realm build on constant fighting from winning their tenth straight Mortal Kombat tournament. The premise of the film is greatly influenced by 1973's Enter the Dragon, you really see it in the movie pacing. Each of the three has a character arch for his or her own reason for competing Liu seeks revenge against the tournament host Shang Tsung (Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa) for killing his brother; Sonya seeks revenge on crime lord Kano (Trevor Goddard) and Cage, having been branded as a fake fighter by the media, seeks to prove them wrong. The character of Art Lean (Kenneth Edwards) doesn't appear in the games. He was created exclusively for the film. I kinda wish, they used another character from the game to replace him, because it's really predictable, whom of the good guys will probably end up dying during the tournament. While, that part of the tournament, makes sense, the whole idea of the tournament as a whole, doesn't. Mortal Kombat is held once a generation to determine Earth's fate. Outworld need to successfully defeated Earth's best challengers in ten consecutive tournaments to conquering humanity. Why? I guess, the tournament existed; as Raiden explains, the tournament is designed to give humans a chance to fight for their world against realms with greater powers, which keeps the realms in check so the strongest ones simply cannot invade the less powerful ones at will. Why again? It's seem like they can travel to Earth, very easy. While, the story doesn't make any sense, the action was alright. Still, you can tell, the different between those actors with some fighting skills, with those with none. Some of them are so slow, and choreograph as hell that it doesn't look real. The PG-13 rating kinda hurt the film, due to the game, being known as very violent and gory. Still, they did what, they can do with it. Lots of freeze deaths, falling off cliffs, and stabbing with no blood. Lots of Easter eggs like finishing moves, and a hint of the 'Friendship' finisher. It was very funny to see that. The special effects are a hit and a misses. The 1990s CGI is barely realistic for me, but at the time, it was alright. The character, Reptile looks kinda stupid, due to that. The puppeteer that control Goro's movement were pretty good. Kevin Michael Richardson did pretty OK job in the voice acting for him. The sets are pretty haunting with the abandoned Kaiser steel mill, being used for Outworld. I love that the movie used the location of Old Ayutthaya as the temples of the Shaolin Monks. It was a nice touch. The movie moves really fast; there is little to no slow moments in the film. I'm pretty glad, they cut the idea of Liu Kang was supposed to fall in love with Kitana (Talisa Soto). It's also pretty cool to see an Asian character in the main role, with white supporting characters. I don't even mind, the fact, that supporting characters like Kanos whom is Japanese-American in the game, and Raiden whom is Chinese in the game, were played by white actors. I just glad, to see Liu Kang as the lead. You rarely see Asian actors in the main role in films. The acting is over the top, and mediocre at best. There were a lot of cheesy dialogue that could had been cut. The soundtrack of Mortal Kombat became a huge hit on its own, becoming a fitness jam that seriously gets you pumped for anything. The movie was well received by fans and was a box office hit at the time, leading to a sequel, 1997's Mortal Kombat Annihilation, which was not well received, even by camp movie standards. Also check out the 1995's prequel animated film The Journey Begins or the spin-off television series, 1996's Mortal Kombat Defenders of the Realm and 1998's Mortal Kombat Konquest for Mortal Kombat fix. Nonetheless, the original introduced its own take on the mythology, some of which was integrated into the canon of future games. Overall Movies based on video games have never been great, but I believe most can agree that Paul W. S. Anderson put more effort into creating this movie than what other directors have given their video-game film adaptations. This movie is an great example. It was very memorable. I consider this one of the top video game films to date.

This is one of the films that for me are timeless especially because it's a true story. It is a classic Mob, gangster movie but portrayed in a different way. Every Mob movie was made the same after the God Father was made and this film stayed true to the plot and essence of the movie with new spin added to it. It has the violence, action and comedy. This is a film based on a true story focused around the main characters name Henry Hill played by Ray Liotta, James Jimmy Conway played by Robert De Niro and Tommy DeVito played by Joe Pesci. Henry and Tommy met as kids running numbers and a cigarette racket for the local Mob family and Jimmy. Henry and Jimmy could never fully be in the Mob as they we not full blooded Italians. So a lot of their security and opportunities came from Tommy who is full blooded Italian. As quickly as they rose to money and power it quickly went it way to do poor choices and loyalty.This movie has your typical Mob style themes or plots. Henry is kid that comes from a good family and hardworking farther, but the street life of gangsters with nice clothes money and women is what attacked him and he felt like that was the life to live. Once he begins to affiliate himself with the family he enjoys the success of the money and respect and meets his future wife name Karen Hill played by Lorraine Bracco. She too quickly become comfortable and use to the life of the family. Getting thousands of dollars and not asking where it came from. Buying whatever she wanted with no question or worried about the prices, all the way down to the cops making regular visits to her house looking for anything criminal to build a case against Henry or any member of the family.Jimmy is older than Henry and Tommy and has been in the life for a while. He is really the master mind of the crew. Nothing really gets down with his approval. He was like their mentor into the life crime and the life of the family. Every job they do is done his way and with no remorse. He has a simple method anyone that can get them caught or could stand in his way they ended up dead. Tommy is the wild fire cracker of the group. He had a temper worse than Jimmy. You never can tell when Tommy is joking or serious. His temper is so bad that in parts of the movie you can see that Henry was scared of him even though they were child hood friends that grew up together. The best depiction of that is the scene when Tommy is telling a joking and Henry is laughing and Tommy ask what is so funny and Henry says the joke and Tommy with a serious tone ask what am I a funny guy do I amuse you and at the same time pulls a gun out.

It's not entertaining, it just a vampire of a movie - it will drain your life slowly for the next 80+ minutes. There's a unwritten rule that if movie doesn't suck you in within the first 10-15 minutes, you should probably stop watching it, and I was wrong not to heed that advice. From the first few minutes of Henry I never really got the sense of what movie wants to be. While there's a solid structure of the movie, scenes felt so random. It wants to be horror, yet it's not, it wants to be drama, yet it's not too dramatic, it's wants to be shocking, but it really isn't that much, even some of the more shocking scenes were rather tame. The only real shock scene is family massacre scene, but it's rather tame compared to shock scenes of modern movies. We rarely ever see something happening within Henry so it's not even a good character study like Maniac or Psycho (I should note, Michael Rooker was pretty good in this one, but bad character is still a bad character), and his buddy Otis is even worse, and you can easily tell what the ending of the movie is going to be.I should also mention that I found it rather boring, by the end I was already looking at the clock. Note, I really don't have problem with slow burner movies that take it's time to build scenes, but payoff to Henry was not worth the wait, because as I said, climax is rather predictable (hint two of three characters are serial killers, go figure out what's going to happen?). No real suspense, no real character development, no real shock, just morons with cameras killing bunch of people for no real reason that further glorifies legend of yet another real-life serial killer that this movie was based upon, and then we ask ourselves why so many of those lunatics are running around in this world. You can never buy anything from either Henry or Otis, because well, they are serial killers.Technically it's bit inept movie, but I won't judge it too much on that, because from what I understand it was shot on really tight budget.So far, I've seen few John McNaughton's movies The Borrower, which had some good ideas and some good black humor, but terrible pace and quite boring at most of the scenes (same as Henry), his Masters of Horror episode was also quite dull.

It's probably best to analyse this film by highlighting the good and the bad points of this film; What I liked about Casablanca in the first instance is the story; refugees who have come from different parts of Europe to the neutral safe haven of Casablanca which is in unoccupied French Morocco. In the beginning. we see snippets of various people who are desperate to leave Casablanca and we see these people have conversations with various people who are prepared to take bribes in order to fulfil their dreams of leaving Casablanca. Although Casablanca is an unoccupied area, refugees are still at risk of being forced into concentration camps hence their desire to flee for proper safe havens such as the US for example. Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart) is an American expatriate who has fled occupied France and now runs a successful café\/bar in Casablanca - he's a popular member of the community, but he becomes even more popular and important when several parties learn that he has acquired two exit visas - 1 of which is for Victor Lazlo (Paul Henreid) who the German Reich are very interested in and who are very keen on Lazlo staying in Casablanca. Blaine becomes pivotal to Lazlo's fate, but Lazlo's wife perhaps also proves pivotal to Blaine's fate as well. This creates a bit of a dilemma for Blaine which helps to increase the intrigue within the film. There was also the wonderful Dooley Wilson's portrayal as Sam - he only had a small role in the film, but I found him to be a warm and caring character and his voice was very soothing and I could listen to him sing 'As Time Goes By' all day - such a wonderful voice. So far, so good....What I didn't like about Casablanca was how contrived and far fetched the romance was between Blaine and Lund; they fall head over heels for each other in a few days so much so that even 2 years later Blaine can't look at another woman or develop any sort of a relationship with any woman whatsoever. Please? Give me a break!! Don't get me wrong. I know that romances like this do exist, but they're usually built up over a long period of time and will usually come through several years of life experiences. I found it hard to believe that they would love each other that much when they both admit that they barely know each other; think about it. Would you fall in love with someone who you barely know? Remember don't confuse 'love' with 'lust'. It also didn't help that the film was pretty much devoid of any sort of tension or conflict - considering it is billed as a Drama, I didn't see much on screen that could be classed as Dramatic. Factor all of this with three unlikeable leads and you've got yourself a very flawed film (note that I said 'flawed' rather than 'bad').Casablanca is a film that is worth watching, but you really need to ignore the hype and judge it on its own merits. If you're a sucker for a nice war time romance then this will do the trick. However, if you look at it a bit deeper, you will see the good, but somewhat 'flawed' classic that I watched.

It is a monochrome homage to Frankenstein's monster franchise and magnificently crafted as a whole new parody with a sterling cast. Unfortunately I haven't watched any of Universal's classical horror series, so it is nonviable for me to discern how the homage aspect proceeds, nevertheless, it doesn't hamper my appreciation of this film. Wilder is Dr. Frederick Frankenstein (the self-claimed pronunciation is Fronkensien), a medical professor in America, whose grandfather is the notorious mad scientist Victor Frankenstein, is lured back to inherit his family estate in Transylvania, but as a scientist himself, Frederick is strongly repellent towards his grandfather's doings. After meeting his bulging-eyed hunchback servant Igor (pronounced eyegore here), who is played by a pronounced Feldman, the desirable personal assistant Inga (Garr with a ludicrous German accent) and the frosty housekeeper Frau Blücher (the haughty and drolly Leachman), he finds out the private journals left by Victor about the reanimation of dead tissues, cannot resist the temptation, he carries out a plan to reanimate his creature (Boyle), only later he is aware that the brain he uses in the transplantation is an abnormal one. Then, the storyline flickeringly stretches over the creature's encounters with a little girl and a blind hermit (a genuinely side-splitting episode with an uncredited Hackman) after his escape, then Wilder and Brooks' script takes a drastic turn to introduce Frederick and the creature's live-performance of Irving Berlin's musical number Puttin' On The Ritz, which ends badly and the creature is captured, but it is pure fun. Frederick's fiancée Elizabeth (Kahn) arrives uninvited, and her consistent refusal any physical intimacy with Frederick in the name of keeping her chastity before wedding night, is comically disintegrated by sheer phallic-ism in front of the creature. And she bells out a riotous Sweet mystery of Life during the intercourse, with some splendid vocal inflections. Brooks opts for a merry finale for both Frederick and his creature, they both exchange some part of their advantages to each other and eventually, they can go out for a pleasant double date.Gene Wilder is priceless, superbly casts his deadpan humor with visceral gags, sometimes he is even affective. The sparkling chemistry between him and the scene-stealing Feldman using wisecracks and slap-sticks can effectively crack viewers up (from the walk this way spoof and on). Boyle's monster, although the make-up team is substandard, you can literally see the paddings and fake stitches in his head, is never ferocious or deliberately harmful, he is a slow-witted newborn has the primal fear of fire and fond of the euphony of violin, the caricature never transcends into scare-fest. Kahn and Leachman are two staunch comediennes, each clings to the stereotyped characterizations and builds on their own zest and zingers, so is Garr, but in a less vivid role as the bimbo and Kenneth Mars' Inspector Kemp, who is extensively lampooned for one stiff limb and inarticulate elocution. The cinematography and production design are sublime thanks to its retro polishing, the film holds extremely well for a first viewing 40 years later, it is a favorable comedy can be thoroughly enjoyed without any abashment in hindsight which prevalently resides in most of our present-day low-taste offerings, just go and watch the scariest comedy of all time!

","genre":"Comedy"},{"date":"7 November 2014","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" My third Mel Brooks' comedy, after HISTORY OF THE WORLD PART I (1981, 6\/10) and HIGH ANXIETY (1977, 6\/10), and I daresay it is his best! It is a monochrome homage to Frankenstein's monster franchise and magnificently crafted as a whole new parody with a sterling cast. Unfortunately I haven't watched any of Universal's classical horror series, so it is nonviable for me to discern how the homage aspect proceeds, nevertheless, it doesn't hamper my appreciation of this film. Wilder is Dr. Frederick Frankenstein (the self-claimed pronunciation is Fronkensien), a medical professor in America, whose grandfather is the notorious mad scientist Victor Frankenstein, is lured back to inherit his family estate in Transylvania, but as a scientist himself, Frederick is strongly repellent towards his grandfather's doings. After meeting his bulging-eyed hunchback servant Igor (pronounced eyegore here), who is played by a pronounced Feldman, the desirable personal assistant Inga (Garr with a ludicrous German accent) and the frosty housekeeper Frau Blücher (the haughty and drolly Leachman), he finds out the private journals left by Victor about the reanimation of dead tissues, cannot resist the temptation, he carries out a plan to reanimate his creature (Boyle), only later he is aware that the brain he uses in the transplantation is an abnormal one. Then, the storyline flickeringly stretches over the creature's encounters with a little girl and a blind hermit (a genuinely side-splitting episode with an uncredited Hackman) after his escape, then Wilder and Brooks' script takes a drastic turn to introduce Frederick and the creature's live-performance of Irving Berlin's musical number Puttin' On The Ritz, which ends badly and the creature is captured, but it is pure fun. Frederick's fiancée Elizabeth (Kahn) arrives uninvited, and her consistent refusal any physical intimacy with Frederick in the name of keeping her chastity before wedding night, is comically disintegrated by sheer phallic-ism in front of the creature. And she bells out a riotous Sweet mystery of Life during the intercourse, with some splendid vocal inflections. Brooks opts for a merry finale for both Frederick and his creature, they both exchange some part of their advantages to each other and eventually, they can go out for a pleasant double date.Gene Wilder is priceless, superbly casts his deadpan humor with visceral gags, sometimes he is even affective. The sparkling chemistry between him and the scene-stealing Feldman using wisecracks and slap-sticks can effectively crack viewers up (from the walk this way spoof and on). Boyle's monster, although the make-up team is substandard, you can literally see the paddings and fake stitches in his head, is never ferocious or deliberately harmful, he is a slow-witted newborn has the primal fear of fire and fond of the euphony of violin, the caricature never transcends into scare-fest.

Christine is not just a killer car movie, but mainly an expertly crafted character study film that explores suburban teen's affections for an automobile can result in catastrophically horrifying consequences. The significant change the screen adaptation had faced was that the car mysteriously has a life of its own, where as in the novel, the car moves because it is possessed by the malevolent spirit of its deceased owner.Many deem Christine to be horror, but it is not the kind of boo horror movie. The horror is expressed from the character's obsession and fascination with his affectionate inanimate object, where he is seduced by Christine's charms and sexually promiscuous attitude, thereby undergoing a remarkable makeover like the car but also inheriting her hidden demeanour. If anything it's horror in a more dramatic sense. This is actually a teen drama, with elements of thriller and mystery thrown in for good measure and because of that it works beautifully. The horror-thriller elements come in when Christine ventures out on a rampage stalking and murdering whoever has disdained and ridiculed Arnie and herself. Carpenter's direction is a lot edgier in its narrative than King's is and went further into making the tragic love story and repressed sexuality between Christine and Arnie the centre of attention. I found the book focused more on the concerns of Christine's deceased owner and his devious intentions to take over Arnie which is why I found Carpenter's better. That's what I mostly remember when I read the book.Keith Gordon has an interesting career, whose acting works include, Jaws 2, Dressed to Kill and Back to School to well renowned director (The Singing Detective, The Walking Dead, The Chocolate War) was the perfect choice for the disturbed Arnie, who turned in an outstanding performance, that I cannot imagine anyone else playing. Check out Static (1985), which is another terrific performance of his. Arnie was the kind of nerd who wasn't a typical nerd and who wasn't proud of being one and certainly had a dark edge from the beginning. And Gordon gave that (facial expressions included). He portrayed a remarkably classic example of a geek, when he wasn't as yet quite evil, already had an underlying sense of delinquency and menace. Keith has appeared in a few good movies, but none match the brilliance of both Carpenter's movie and the role he was playing. Alongside are John Stockwell, also a director of known surf movies Blue Crush and Into the Blue and Alexandra Paul (Baywatch), who turn in fine performances as respectively Popular Jock and best friend Dennis and the concerned Leigh Cabbot, Arnie's girlfriend and Christine's competition.Carpenter's passion for Panavision widescreen is used to such marvelous benefits and goes even further with such graceful and steady panaglide and dolly shots, which emphasize the surreal and dreamy 80's gone wrong 50's aesthetic. Plus, Carpenter's synthesizer scores are used to wonderful effect. They serve the very dramatically and supernatural, dream-like atmosphere, especially the loneliness and vulnerability of Arnie. One of his more subtle but beautifully rendered scores.Overall, John Carpenter's Christine is a marvelous tale about a teen's mysterious love for such an affectionate and inanimate object any male would love to own and the horrifying monstrosity that he soon unleashes upon himself for better or worse! The dramatization and dreaminess of the love story is perfectly captured and more sensitive than Titanic and the underlying cheeky sense of humour is more devilishly darker than Batman Returns! This proves John Carpenter's unique and artistic style stands head above the constraints of Hollywood and his passion for telling stories about people confronting any form nature ambiguously takes shape. Also featuring atmospherically supernatural music tones with a wonderful stock of 50's rock n roll music that serves an integral part of Christine sharing Arnie's love as well as Carpenter's eye for selecting natural character actors including Keith Gordon at his Oscar worthy and stellar supporting cast of golden era heroes, Harry Dean Stanton, Robert Prosky and Roberts Blossom and a killer car with an insatiable taste and jealousy for reckless love, John Carpenter's Christine is a classic that belongs in his vast category of uniquely constructed genre films. John Carpenter made two love stories with Columbia, being this and Starman, with the latter being more a traditional tale of love. In many ways, the two can be perfectly viewed together by watching Carpenter take on two love stories with completely opposite tones. I personally give Christine a 10 out 10!

However, before Romero's Living Dead films, the word zombie often had a very different connotation, going back to the voodoo rituals that would create mindless slaves. From classic horror movies like WHITE ZOMBIE and I WALKED WITH A ZOMBIE to Hammer's PLAGUE OF THE ZOMBIES, this was the archetype that Hollywood explored when it talked about zombies and it is this territory that Craven hearkens back to in this late 80s classic.There is a lot to love about this movie, starting with that general concept. Though lovers of classic cinema may be familiar with the films I mentioned, most modern horror fans hadn't really seen a voodoo zombie movie before. To me, as a 13 year old kid when this was released, this was something completely new, exploring a culture that was wild and exotic and more than a little creepy.That creepiness pervades this movie. There is so much atmosphere created. Craven does a great job of introducing his main character to psychotropic drugs right in the beginning. This allows him to play with some surreal dream imagery thereafter and create all sort of bizarre images for us, all wrapped under the guise of our heroes mind being opened up to the spiritual. Beyond the dream images, Craven injects all manner of wonderful imagery into this movie, using the Haitian landscape, human fear of being buried alive, catholic and voodoo iconography and some of the creepiest cemeteries you'll see. All of it creates this world where just about anything is possible and most of it will be nightmarish.The writing is actually pretty good, for a horror movie. They work in the requisite budding romance, without it ever feeling tacked on and unnecessary. They manage to add in several subplots, as well, that add to the movie instead of detract, created a very layered film that not only explores voodoo, but the temperature of the Haitian political climate at the time.Some of the effects now look a little dated, but I'm not going to hold that against a movie. They are products of their time, naturally. If they are one of those lucky films that manages to hold up, even better, but many look dated 30 years later.The biggest negative to me and the thing I notice the most on recent viewings is that Bill Pullman is just...bad. He's presented to us as an almost Indiana Jones type of explorer and I'm not buying it for a minute. His vocal tone seems more high-pitched than I remember him being in his other roles. The worst parts of his performance come when he's relied on to perform the more physical aspects such as the torture scene, or his big moment when he's been drugged and looking for help. He just looks really amateurish to me in these moments and I find that he's the biggest thing keeping this from being a little higher rated in my opinion.

Those are the things that raise the value of a movie. *************** SPOILERS BELOW ******************************The ending is interesting. I believe Nicholson (Alec Guinness) set off the bombs deliberately (and not by accidentally as many seem to believe, because they reason - that he would never intentionally destroy a bridge which he had been working on for so long). In the final scene the Colonel (=Nicholas = Alec Guinness) says what have I done, presumably realizing he's been collaborating with the Japanese. Then he runs towards the detonator, before being mortally wounded by Warden's mortar shell. Unless he was planning the set off the bombs, he wouldn't run towards the detonator. So, right at the end he realizes , that in the big picture it doesn't matter that the Brits may got a nice recognition for building a bridge , it is much more important to serve your country, and not help your opponent. (As his medic friend tries to tell him throughout the movie)I did have some issues with this movie. But it is however undeniable that BotRK is a very good movie , especially for its time!

This was his first venture into all-talking, all-sound film, thirteen years after the end on the silent era. The result was one of the finest pieces of cinema in the last 70 years. First impressions are, for any veteran Chaplin fan, simply familiar territory. We see a hapless private during the war fail at the most basic tasks and be humiliated for it. Then we see a ludicrous bomb spin around the flour in circles after our supposed protagonist. Personally this form of comedy is not to my tastes yet Chaplin is one of few comedians able to make it work for me, leading more to my great respect for this filmmaker. This really sets the tone for the film of serious situations and events portrayed in a more accessible way for the audience. Considering the 1940 release this was very important in order to raise awareness of the war in Europe. And it is clear that this was one of Chaplin's goals as the conclusion to the film shows. Chaplin gives a typically on form performance filled with great timing and physicality that he became famous for. Hilarity ensues whenever he wants it to and this fact is why he is one of the greatest comic actors of all time. In many ways this is a one man show, not suggesting the supporting cast is in any way irrelevant or underwhelming. They are just great for Chaplin to bounce off. Yet combined with him leads to some brilliantly choreographed sequences. The sets are visually impressive when coupled with this choreography and the mise-en-scene overall has to be commended. Its comedic twist on authentic, what was current eastern European lifestyles and militaristic parodies of Nazi uniform and propaganda are ingenious. All this combined makes for a fantastically memorable film that has stood the test of time, yet it is considered one of the all-time greats. This is because of, what I consider to be the most potent, relevant and emotionally impactful speech in not only cinema history but in the last one hundred years. The raw, unrelenting passion Chaplin exudes during these defining moments are is nothing short of beautiful. What makes this so expressively vivid is how, as a modern audience member of the twenty first century, I can see how the same problems remain after all these years. Chaplin glimpsed a future without division, without hatred, anger, war and intolerance, a future we could so easily attain. Yet we are all human, something The Great Dictator shows will just lead to the same problems again and again as Chaplin's character fails again and again.

Hilarity ensues whenever he wants it to and this fact is why he is one of the greatest comic actors of all time. In many ways this is a one man show, not suggesting the supporting cast is in any way irrelevant or underwhelming. They are just great for Chaplin to bounce off. Yet combined with him leads to some brilliantly choreographed sequences. The sets are visually impressive when coupled with this choreography and the mise-en-scene overall has to be commended. Its comedic twist on authentic, what was current eastern European lifestyles and militaristic parodies of Nazi uniform and propaganda are ingenious. All this combined makes for a fantastically memorable film that has stood the test of time, yet it is considered one of the all-time greats. This is because of, what I consider to be the most potent, relevant and emotionally impactful speech in not only cinema history but in the last one hundred years. The raw, unrelenting passion Chaplin exudes during these defining moments are is nothing short of beautiful. What makes this so expressively vivid is how, as a modern audience member of the twenty first century, I can see how the same problems remain after all these years. Chaplin glimpsed a future without division, without hatred, anger, war and intolerance, a future we could so easily attain. Yet we are all human, something The Great Dictator shows will just lead to the same problems again and again as Chaplin's character fails again and again. Yet with the courage and hope he gains at the very end, the world changes. As The Great Dictator shows, without hope all is lost. ","genre":"Comedy, Drama, War"}]
