[{"date":"10 September 2008","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Magnolia is a film that asks more questions then it answers. From the over the top characters to the rain of frogs magnolia is a test in how far great diologue and acting can take you. The script was beautifully written and the acting was excellent, but does that justify the journey that magnolia takes us on? In the beginning Magnolia sets its self up to be a movie about coincidence and fate,it seems to diverge from this theme though as the film goes on. Nothing in the narrative is outstandingly coincidental. The focus of the film becomes 7 people whos lives are miserable and the ways in which they try to remedy their misery. As the film progresses the connections between the 7characters are illustrated, but there is no profound meaning or lesson to these connections. As the film begins to come to a close the characters do have their own personal wake up calls and we get some closure on their stories.The last curve ball that P.T. Anderson throws the audience is the final acts culmination of a rain of frogs. To what conclusion this element was trying to bring, this viewer does not know.
