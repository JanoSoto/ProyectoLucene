I couldn't get past the bad parts. For starters, the film is very improbable as well as unrealistic with too many silly elements that do not at all mesh with the very serious and dramatic tone maintained throughout. Because the film doesn't contain the necessary parts of a satire it can't be argued that it was meant to be one. In the end, the movie ends up being 2 hours of outlandish violence and very irritating characters that received way too much screen time. I found myself wanting to fast forward any scene containing the minor character Rocco. And the 5 minute flaky detective scenes where he is singing to opera music and dressing in drag was just too senseless and foolish for me to stomach. I would have at least felt better about movie if, at the end, the Irish brothers recognized Rocco's annoying mannerisms and shot him for being so aggravating and stupid! The only `saving grace' about this movie, and the only reason I would ever consider re-watching this movie, is the `coolness' of the two brothers. The brothers interacted well together and were very entertaining to watch so long as they weren't in any scenes with any of the other characters. In conclusion. I found this movie to be annoying and very disappointing. It has a good premise, though not original. Nothing was special about the editing or special effects, or even the characters themselves.  If you want a movie with good shootouts, and `cool' guys with real accents check out movies like Snatch or Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels. These movies are a lot of what this movie wishes it could at least be compared to. As for the director's debut He needs a lot more practice and I'd like to know how he goes from an absolute nobody to getting such a movie budget to make such a horrid film.

And in those three years, our film landscape has literally been dominated by the series.  There have been other films of importance, but nothing that can truly compare with the scope and the sheer grandiose manner in which LOTR has inundated us with.  Simply put, there has not been more of a domination of films since Star Wars and its original sequels hogged grosses and headlines from 1977-1983.  I am an avid and eager contributor to imdb and I love to write reviews but have purposely not said anything about the three LOTR films because I wanted to wait until I had seen all three of them before commenting on them.  Now that I have seen all three, let me begin with FOTR.The Lord of the Rings The Fellowship of the Ring is a thing of beauty. This is a film that is nearly perfect in every way.  Beginning with the characters, this film takes us on a labyrinthine journey through middle earth and part of the fun is meeting everyone that is going to play a part in the story down the road.  I think the EE on DVD is an even better film than the theatrical version and if you have a chance to see it, even though it is 4 hours long, do yourself a favour and do so.  There is much more explained than what you see in the theatrical version.FOTR introduces us to the hobbits, to Gandalf the wizard and his adversary Sauruman and ultimately to the great eye, Sauron.  Also along the journey to Mordor are Gimli, Legolas, Aragorn and the three other hobbits, Samwies, Merry and Pippin.The one element of FOTR that struck me is that it is a film about discovery. The journey begins here and it is that much more fun to see the genesis of the story and the genesis of the characters.  In each of the three films, each character grows a bit at a time.  In FOTR, we get to see the start of this journey.  Frodo is just a scared hobbit thrust into a great deed here. In ROTK he grows into an honourable and stoic character, but in here, he is scared and feels alone, even with his fellowship of nine.Perhaps one of the main reasons that makes this film so much better than the last two, in my opinion, is that it perfectly blends action and character into a beautiful narrative and it makes you feel for the characters you are watching.  Gandalf's fate in this film is a heartwrenching scene and Boromir's is even tougher to get through.  I shed a few tears at the end of this film.FOTR should have won a plethora of Oscars in 2001 and it is a shame that it lost to A Beautiful Mind.  I think that in 10 years, no one will remember this as Ron Howard's film that took the Oscar.  But FOTR will be remembered as one of the best films of the last 20 years.  There is a bit of everything in the film and for those that crave excellence in film, they need look no further than Fellowship of the Ring.  I have it at number 9 on my all time list and that is saying something.  This is truly a remarkable film.  I have always thought that the books were just okay stories but to see what Jackson and his team of writers has managed to do, is truly remarkable.  In the book, the best part of the story was the meeting of the Fellowship.  This was at the council of Elrond and it is also one of the best scenes in the film.  This is where we get to meet Boromir and Legolas and Gimli.  In the book, I remember the council scene being close to 100 pages in length. Much of it was just talk and in the film, Jackson has managed to keep much of the intrigue with scenes like this, but condensing them to fit into a 3 hour film.  This is just one of the nuances of the film that make it such a fine piece of film making.While I still believe that Star Wars is the best fantasy series ever filmed, at least Lord of the Rings is a voice for today's generation and they have a film that they can relate to and call their own so that in 30 years from now the next great fantasy epic is unleashed, the debate can rage all over again, which is the best of all time?FOTR is one of the best films of all time.10\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"13 January 2004","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":"  Well, it has been three years since the Lord of the Rings graced our screens.

He must decide whether to put these people that he's become friends with in jail, or go down the same road they have and get trapped into a life of crime and violence. His mentor in this world, Lefty (Pacino), is an aging hitman and is really the only person he can trust&#133;and even though it's Brasco's job to take down people like Lefty, he becomes a true and valuable friend. Brasco must decide whether to take down this new found world as his job requires and betray those who trust him and those he's learned to respect, or succumb to the mob and betray his job.It was a nice change to see Pacino play a character that I felt sympathetic towards, as his usual tough-guy roles leave little room for that. He plays a passed-up aging hitman with dreams of leaving the life of crime behind and never looking back. Both Depp and Pacino perform with respectable style as usual and the chemistry between them seems to work, even if it's not the duo you'd expect to see on screen together.

Even though it was based in a true story as well, it ticked me off when Henry Hill ratted out all of his lifetime friends and family to save his own hide and took a little enjoyment out of it for me. But with this movie, I felt it ended perfectly. My only qualm about the movie is how much they use the phrase `fogettaboutit'. It's already a cliché, so why feed the fire?

To Kill A Mockingbird is set during the 1930s. It develops a lot of different themes such as education, prejudice, and social class. The theme that impacted me the most was racism; that is why I changed my thoughts about equality. I love how the movie describes the trial of Tom Robinson with Gregory Peck as his lawyer, Atticus Finch. I liked a lot of things about To Kill A Mockingbird. The characters are like the book describes them. My favorite movies are suspense (mystery) movies, so I love the mystery of Boo Radley because I didn't know what really happened to him or how he really is. The case of Tom Robinson was the theme I liked the most because just for prejudice among white people toward black people, a good man was tried. Also, I liked all the history of the Finch family, and the life of each member, because each one had different thoughts and feelings. Finally, my favorite character was Scout Finch because she was a smart, strong girl, who tells the story with innocence and love. Although the movie was beautiful, there are some things I would change in the film, To Kill A Mockingbird. The character that I dislike was Aunt Alexandra because she always was criticizing Scout. She just looks at what Scout wears instead of looking at her feelings and thoughts. The worst character of the movie was Boo Ewell because he doesn't care about his children, he puts an innocent man on trial, and he tries to kill Scout and Jem. Also, I dislike Ms. Caroline Fisher because she was very rude with Scout, instead of feeling proud of her, she told her to stop reading at home. Gregory Peck is a wonderful actor, as Atticus Finch. He looks the same as the book, a man who shows empathy and courage. He shows empathy because he doesn't judge the people by their social class, and courage because he takes the case of Tom Robinson. He is the best lawyer; he doesn't care what the others say. He is a colossal man, big and extraordinary as the father of the family. Gregory Peck was an excellent actor; he showed his life through his movies. On a scale of 1 to 10, I rate the film, To Kill A Mockingbird, with an 8. The film is the same as the book, and develops all the themes. For example, the theme of prejudice is developed through the case of Tom Robinson. Also, the setting is like the book describes it, Maycomb, 1930. Although the movie was very good, I think it lacks special features such as color, music, and background. Also, the movie skips some parts of the book. For example, when Atticus went to Tom Robinson's house to tell his wife he died, in the book he went with Calpurnia but in the film he went with Jem. To Kill A Mockingbird is an excellent movie. According to the American Film Institute, it is one of the 34th best movies of all time. It is a story that maintains suspense from the beginning until the end. When any person starts watching, they can't stop seeing it because it is an amazing film.

For example, Adam Sandler doesn't really bother me. He was perfect for Happy Gilmore (which I think is a great mindless comedy). But Keanu Reeves is one actor that I, personally, have never considered a great--much less good--actor. In Bill and Ted and The Matrix he's fine, yes, because he fits the parts given to him (new generation slackers).Speed is one of my all-time favorite action films, but not really because of Reeves himself.The movies in which he is supposed to display true emotions--such as Feeling Minnesota or A Walk in the Clouds--are the ones that bother me, because I know that there are better actors putting on school plays who aren't getting paid--yet he's raking in the millions. Many of his dramatic roles are rather dry and laughable. When it comes to *real* roles, Keanu just fails miserably.I'll explain why, since I'll probably get angry letters from Matrix fans and teenage girls with posters of him on their walls if I don't. My main problem with Reeves is that he's always the same. His face is always the same. His tone of voice. His expressions. His mannerisms. For the sake of comparison, imagine Dustin Hoffman in Rain Man. Now imagine Keanu Reeves trying to play Raymond Babbitt. See what I mean?In The Watcher, Keanu is a serial killer who toys around with an ex-FBI Agent (James Spader) whose lover Keanu killed years before in a fire. (Bad, Keanu, bad!) In fact, Joel Campbell (Spader) moved all the way to Chicago in order to escape his past, and even retired from the FBI.Now David (Reeves) is back in Joel's life, sending him pictures of victims a day before they are to be murdered. He has twenty-four hours to find them before David does.What a great premise. A pleasant twist on the serial killer routine, right? Err...no, not really. The direction feels like a long action-packed music video--from the opening titles blaring a loud Rob Zombie song to the end, complete with the stereotypical Killer's Point of View that was original in 1978 when John Carpenter's Halloween first invented it (and when it was indeed a very controversial filmmaking technique), but is now getting old since it's frequently being used incorrectly, particularly in the case of The Watcher. Keanu's character seems to see things through some type of strobe music video vision--perhaps that explains his love of music in the film. This is a good song, he says to one victim before strangling her.In all honesty, The Watcher isn't really a truly bad movie (in fact, I've seen much worse), but if I had to pinpoint the problems with The Watcher, it would be these three things1. Direction. Joe Charbanic, a first-time director with his outing in The Watcher, proves that he should never get behind a camera ever again. As I mentioned before, there are just too many moments when I felt that I was watching some music video or product placement commercial instead of a smart serial killer film. Some people just aren't meant to get behind the wheel of a moving car. The same goes for a moving reel of footage.2. The Script. What starts interesting and even compelling soon turns into a routine chase-the-killer film with extravagant car chases and bad character introductions. (Marisa Tomei's student psychiatrist is obviously there for two reasons--to fall in love with the hero and to be kidnapped by the villain. Take a wild guess if it happens or not.) In fact, this film had loads of potential to stand out amongst the rest of its kind by using the original plot--twenty-four hours to find the victim--but it is soon left forgotten and too many plot holes (why wouldn't the victim see herself on TV or on one of the millions of ads placed around Chicago?) are left unchecked.3. The Acting. James Spader is at the very least marginally convincing as a gruff I-Don't-Care-Anymore cop, but he's no Martin Riggs. Instead, he comes off as a whiny, selfish little creep who likes to inject drugs into his body to get a momentary high. This is are hero, folks.Also, is Keanu an invincible boogeyman or not? Lord knows that his mysterious character, David, is untouchable--he survives a foot chase without being seen, he manages to sneak past security cameras and cops and manages to kidnap\/kill female victims; he survives a truly ludicrous car chase (that lowered my score for the film by a half a notch), gets shot, caught on fire, and STILL manages to jump out of a window on fire and into a lake? I half expected him to get up once more and give us all one last scare. Honestly, in Halloween, the insinuations of Michael Myers' invincibility were more than hinted at. Here, we are left to wonder whether or not the killer is some type of supernatural force or not. The film is too eager to wrap all the loose ends up without digging deeper into the material.Who knows, next year we could see The Watcher II David's Return. Maybe David will spring back to life as a burn victim's worst nightmare and wreak havoc on the lives of very distant relations. (Maybe we'll even see Freddy vs. Jason vs. David.)

Lord knows that his mysterious character, David, is untouchable--he survives a foot chase without being seen, he manages to sneak past security cameras and cops and manages to kidnap\/kill female victims; he survives a truly ludicrous car chase (that lowered my score for the film by a half a notch), gets shot, caught on fire, and STILL manages to jump out of a window on fire and into a lake? I half expected him to get up once more and give us all one last scare. Honestly, in Halloween, the insinuations of Michael Myers' invincibility were more than hinted at. Here, we are left to wonder whether or not the killer is some type of supernatural force or not. The film is too eager to wrap all the loose ends up without digging deeper into the material.Who knows, next year we could see The Watcher II David's Return. Maybe David will spring back to life as a burn victim's worst nightmare and wreak havoc on the lives of very distant relations. (Maybe we'll even see Freddy vs. Jason vs. David.) What will the tagline for The Watcher II be? Hmm.... How about, This time...it's even more personal than last time. No, thanks, I'll pass.2.5\/5 ","genre":"Crime, Horror, Mystery"},{"date":"13 January 2004","score":"5 out of 10 people found the following review useful","review":"  This is one of my favourite movies, and one of the most beautiful films ever shot.

No movie that I have ever seen has had such random and simply to-die-for content.

It's simply too weird and random for anyone not to have some form of interest in it. But not only that, this movie has comedy, romance, jealousy, revenge, and more senseless violence than one can shake a stick at.  What's really satisfying about this movie is the fact that when you first watch it, you think it's just another zombie flick, riddled with one-liners and skull-popping head shots&#133;but after a few minutes, you realize that you've stumbled across something much more. You begin to realize that the zombie story is simply a backdrop for something much larger. First off, the camera work is truly masterful. There are many nice shots that are seemingly out of place in this type of flick, but it helps at to the atmosphere which this movie has buckets off. It helps add to the overall spooky European feel to the cemetery. What's more is, besides being a zombie flick, this movie has plenty of dark comedy to go around for all of you sick and twisted folk out there. If you like to laugh at people getting their heads ran over by a bus, heads exploded from behind by a .357 Magnum, buses of boy scouts running off of a cliff, or premature castration, then this movie is for you!I'm finding myself at a loss for words while trying to write this review which is not typical, but after thinking about this movie a little more I can see why.

Story takes place in Japan in the 1860's and a lone samurai warrior is wandering about with no place to go. Sanjuro (Toshiro Mifune) comes to a fork in the road and decides which way to go by the way a stick is pointed. He ends up in a town where a dog has a human hand in his mouth and this perks Sanjuro's interest and he decides to hang around. He goes to a local tavern and meets the owner Gonji (Eijiro Tono) who feeds him sake and rice and he tells him of the troubles that the town has. He explains that Ushitora (Kyu Sazanka) and Seibei (Seizaburo Kawazu) once were business partners but had a terrible falling out and now both head gangs and want to take over the town. Sanjuro is amused by this and he heads into the street where he encounters some thugs from Ushitora's side and he kills most of them. The word spreads quickly that a strong samurai is in the area and both want to pay him to be their bodyguard. Sanjuro uses his wits to get paid by both of them and set up events where members of each gang get killed and blame each other.*****SPOILER ALERT*****Ushitora has a brother Unosuke (Tatsuya Nakadai) that owns a gun and he figures out that Sanjuro has been playing everyone for fools so he manages to get his sword away from him and they take him back to their lair where Sanjuro is badly beaten. He manages to escape and with the help of Gonji he hides out near a cemetery until he gets strong enough to seek revenge.Yojimbo is a classic all by itself and it has inspired many other films most notably A Fistful of Dollars with Clint Eastwood. So many things make this a unique film and how can you forget the shot of the dog with the hand in his mouth? Sanjuro was looking for a place where maybe he could find trouble brewing and one look at what that dog was carrying was a clear signal that he was in the right spot. The cinematographer is Kazuo Miyagawa who has worked with Akira Kurosawa many times and this is a terrific film to look at. There are many scenes where characters are standing in the street and the wind is blowing dirt and sand and these shots add so much life to the screen even when the characters are silent. Mifune once again is magnificent and one of the great things about his character are the human flaws that ultimately almost get him killed. At first Sanjuro is brash and confident but after helping a couple and their child he leaves himself vulnerable. Sanjuro is horribly beaten and Mifune shows every ounce of pain that his character is experiencing and its in stark contrast from earlier in the film where Sanjuro's movements seemed lackadaisical from confidence. Mifune had an incredible screen presence and watching him in certain scenes late in the film I was reminded of Robert DeNiro in Raging Bull where these characters were alone and had to ponder how they ever got into their situation. This part of the story gives the film a zone of realism that the audience can identify with and this makes Sanjuro more human. Kurosawa always had great set designs and the town that this story is suppose to take place in resembles something from a western and its probably not a coincidence since Kurosawa loved American films. This is easily a must see for everyone and I believe its one of Mifune's greatest performances.

Agent Kujan (CHAZZ PALMINTERI) takes the case. He has questions and only Verbal Kint (KEVIN SPACEY), a man who once had a relationship with Kujan's main suspect, has the answers. The film takes the audience on a magnificent ride through Kint's story and his experiences with Dean Keaton, played convincingly by Gabriel Byrne. The twists and turns lead to one of the most shocking endings in cinematic history.Bryan Singer, director of The Usual Suspects, has created a film that excels in lighting and creative shots. The scenes at the pier during the firefight are extremely eerie, due in no small part to the lighting and the ghostly wanderings of Soze. The tension is mounted upon these, accompanied by John Ottman's spectacular score. But the music is just as eerie as the silence. Singer knows when the have the music mute in particular scenes. He knows when to place the lights up or low, knows how to manipulate the camera to jerk a certain emotion from us. He does it well.

The scenes at the pier during the firefight are extremely eerie, due in no small part to the lighting and the ghostly wanderings of Soze. The tension is mounted upon these, accompanied by John Ottman's spectacular score. But the music is just as eerie as the silence. Singer knows when the have the music mute in particular scenes. He knows when to place the lights up or low, knows how to manipulate the camera to jerk a certain emotion from us. He does it well. It's the sign of a great director.But every film has a downside, however small it may be, and this film is no exception. Fenster (BENICIO DEL TORO), one of Kint's associates, although a funny character, has no relevance to the film. Nothing he says has any importance and the movie seems to only use the character as comic relief from a rather dark and dreary movie. Del Toro does perform well with the character but the film would probably would have been more believable without him.Kevin Spacey's performance as Kint earned him an Academy Award and the film earned countless others from lesser organizations. This film deserves to be ranked among the best mystery films in recent history. The bar has been set -  it will be hard to surpass it.Rating 10 out of 10 ","genre":"Crime, Drama, Mystery"},{"date":"13 January 2004","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  whilst i enjoyed this movie it troubles me that screenwriters not only cut out important scenes but add ones that never happend in the book is this to satisfy their own egos or because they thought they could write it better than tolkein and why miss out tom bombadil dont you think robin williams would have made a great tom..well just curious.

And seeing it now, not only brings back those thoughts from childhood, but several new ones. This film is not meant to be a serious space war epic. It wasn't created to mock those movies either, like Space Balls. It was created to entertain, to make light of an underused genre in film. It wasn't intended to impress, which makes it impressive. I, for one, love this film, and will continue to watch it over and over again.

You must also know some more about Belgians and their disrespect (and that is a metaphore!) of the Congolese state. Lumumba and the Congolese people didn't deserve this as he was right. We Belgians did exploit them for decades. But just because Lumumba reacted not so friendly to Bwana Kitoko (the king was called this way by the Congolese in a previous visit, he was hailed as a great leader) they had to further destabilize Congo and assassinate Lumumba. So he called for the help of the USSR, that was his only option as everybody else was against him. For the Congolese people the US didn't do anything like they did for us with the Marshall Plan. They did support Mobutu's cruel dictatorial rule with lots of money. What good did that do for the average Congolese?And the trouble didn't stop with the flight of Mubutu. In modern sociological terms, Congo is considered a failed state. And that has it's reasons (and we Belgians are responsible for a large part of those). I hope that Lumuba's dream will still come true and that the Congolese peace process will last so peace and a way of living that is accepted by all Congolese may finally come for them. Back to the film You can't expect to understand the complex situation the new independent Congo was put in just by watching this film. That's like thinking the film Enemy at the Gates will explain me everything about the battle of Stalingrad. The film is restricted in many ways and the viewer must understand that.  first It's a film, not a documentary. Some of the scenes are interpretations but they are needed for the plot. second The main character is Lumumba. Not everything about the troubles in Katanga or elsewhere is told, neither is everything about Mobutu told. It would have been an endless film that way.  third The film is an African film, let them create their own ways of telling this story. White people shouldn't tell them how to tell a story. But I'm glad that some funded this film that tell some people more about an unclear history. It might encourage them to find out more about Lumumba or various other things after the credits roll away and that is a good thing.
