We have seen black listed characters, reformed cons and courtesans, and those from the outer fringes of a western frontier on screen before. It isn't until River of No Return,however, that we see characters that we can truly believe have been to prison, shaved with cold water, or any for that matter, and have made money selling nothing but themselves. Robert Mitchum and Marilyn Monroe bring a reality to the underworld of a time gone past that John Wayne could never hope to imagine. This is not to say that Stagecoach isn't a masterpiece, it's just a declarative statement that with Otto Preminger's 1954 throwaway we truly have a diamond in the rough.The movie opens with Robert Mitchum's character, Matt Calder, roaming through a Dodge City'esq village trying to locate his son. He is an ex-con and makes it very clear that his only goal is to peacefully raise his kin. With these first shots, Otto Preminger creates an environment we immediately believe to be riddled with scum and trash. Calder appears as a master navigator of this ocean, one with genuine and admirable intent, and the audience is invited to put down their popcorn and enjoy the ride. The movie offers everything one would want out of the western genre (actually filmed in Canada). It's intense and gritty and we get to take a peek into a side of life we only dare take with a life preserver around our waist. We then hear a voice and get to lay our eyes on Kay Weston, played by Marilyn Monroe. It appears as though she's been waiting at that saloon for years before a camera crew happened to stop by and film a Hollywood production. It is Kay's boyfriend who robs Matt Calder forcing the group to travel down the river in search of the stolen property. The first act carries through naturally and beautifully and before you know it you're watching what has already become one of your favorite movies. Then some stuff happens.The movie has sequences, especially those taking place on the river, that are beyond dated. The effects are difficult to watch without laughing and the fights appear to be choreographed by Jack Horner (the director from Boogie Nights). The reason why these sections of the picture are so difficult to watch is because they are always sandwiched by some of the most beautiful and poetic filmmaking the screen has ever seen. Where John Wayne's character in Stagecoach is from the beginning an advocate of the prostitute he is traveling with, Matt Calder looks down upon his travel-mate. The developing sentiment between them is troubled but invited, it is interesting and feels like something we're more familiar with from a 1970's anti-western. The duo, along with Calder's son, arrive at the town of the final showdown. What happens is unexpected and reminds the audience that they are not just watching another movie.In all the movie is uneven but beautiful. What could have been a masterpiece was instead left to rot, evident from the apathy the director must have had for his material. What the viewer must remember is to enjoy what is right about the movie and to accept the faults for what they are. In the end River of No Return will be a rewarding adventure and introduce a new generation to just how cool Robert Mitchum really was. A coolness that could still be used in cinema today. As for Marilyn Monroe, she does what she's unfairly forced to do with every picture she participated in, proves she can act.

Whether it's the movie itself, or just happening to see that film at exactly the right time in your life. The Graduate for me, is one of those films.The beauty of this film is how the mood and feelings of the main character dictate everything else. The lighting, sound, editing; everything is all about Benjamin and how he is relating to this world he lives in. When he feels suffocated by the world he is in and isolated from everything that surrounds him, we too feel it in the absolute silence the director allows. In fact, the most poignant moments of the film for me were when the character didn't speak at all. The blank look on his face tied in with music that so brilliantly conveyed everything going on inside him that he just could not get out said more about his character in a single scene than some movies can pull off through their entire course. The plot itself mirrored the turmoil and confusion going on inside Benjamin. How indecisive and unsure he was about what he wanted to be and how he fit into the world. He wiles his time away with Mrs. Robinson (his feelings on this relationship can be summed up in the scene where his father asks him what he is doing and he responds, 'I'm drifting') while trying to find himself and understand just exactly who Benjamin is. When he happens across Elaine, he finally feels that rush that comes with having a sense of purpose. She is someone he can connect to and can feel like himself with. He has an identity with her as opposed to with her mother where he nothing more than a fake name. On that note, I adored the scene where he entered the hotel with Elaine, everybody calling him by this other name he has gone by for ages now; a reminder of how lost he has been with Mrs. Robinson. But this is taken away from him by Mrs. Robinson when she lies about what he has done and turns her family against him. His time drifting is now his undoing.The ending scene was perfection because it wasn't a clear cut happy ending. Benjamin made his decision to go after Elaine; to claim his identity in her outside of Mrs. Robinson and his own family, but the expressions on their faces as soon as the adrenaline wears off speak of the fact that they don't quite have things figured out yet.

Even as computer-generated imagery (CGI) has given animation, action films, and fantasy pictures an antiseptic sleekness and a practical way to showcase certain unforeseen sequences as if they could really happen, films like Star Trek A Motion Picture, its corresponding TV series, and 2001 A Space Odyssey existed in a time where amateurish special effects where what was predominately available. Director Stanley Kubrick and the studio of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM), however, found sources to provide beautiful and limitless cinematography and special effects work in order to bring space into theaters all over the world. This achievement alone is enough to warrant 2001's placement amongst some of the most important films of all time.That's just what 2001 is - one of the most significant films ever made. Its use of special effects is incredible, its themes ranging from existentialism to human and mankind's value in the face of excelling technology, its developed and authentic style showcasing space exploration, and its use of detailed visuals all make its placement on such a list a worthy one. Too many people get caught up in trying to find the best films that they forget about the ones that made splashes, which circumvented into impacts, game-changers, and iconic works. 2001 is an iconic work from a director who, had he never touched cinema, may've set cinema back several years.The film is divided into four vignettes that detail man's interactions with advanced and incalculably valuable Monoliths, otherwise known as high-powered machines that do much of the thinking for humans when it comes to space travel and exploration. The first vignette concerns the dawn of man, following ape-like beings trying to find food in a vast desert, the second concerns passengers aboard a Pan-AM space plane that learn of an epidemic occurring at one of the Lunar bases they're destined to come in contact with, the third and longest shows a group of scientists traveling aboard the spacecraft Discovery One, joined by the advanced, supercomputer HAL 9000, a machine that should be helping them on their journey to Jupiter but instead seems to be hindering them, and the fourth concerns Jupiter and beyond.Each of these vignettes could easily spawn individual reviews, and because of that, it's difficult to look at 2001 A Space Odyssey as an entire project. In one-hundred and forty-eight minutes, the film manages to be often enthralling, wondrous, and on occasions, maddening, as some scenes shine and other scenes seem to drag. But all is well, as there is always something occurring in Kubrick's realm of directorial flair and Geoffrey Unsworth's unmatchable cinematography.With all the praise 2001's visuals have earned, it seems like nothing more than a waste of time to address them once again, but they must be. Unsworth's detail is simply exquisite, whether he is showing the vast openness and emptiness of space or he is showing the calculated quarters of these large and sometimes quite ominous spacecrafts. Pay attention to Kubrick and Unsworth's use of the color red, as it often is used to denote fear, vulnerability, and uncertainty. In addition, consider some of the unique and trickier visual sequences, such as the famous Star-Gate scene, where thousands and thousands of colors hit the screen at once, causing a mass amount of pressure and unbelievable visual annihilation on ones retinas. The scene was accomplished thanks to slit-scan photography, which is where a slide that has been slit is inserted between the camera and the camera's subject, resulting in a disorienting but indescribably beautiful and unique work of art.Because of 2001's plethora of visual techniques, along with its lengthy runtime, there's a lot to see but also a lot of detail to miss in terms of sights and themes. With this being my first viewing, I was astounded by how useless and void of significance the human characters are in this film. They essentially have no value outside of being devices for which the Monoliths and the technology work off of. This is quite the bleak future Kubrick and co-writer Arthur C. Clarke.2001 A Space Odyssey works the best when there is no dialog or character interaction and we're left to focus on a spacecraft drifting in the cold loneliness of space or we're watching the stars sit amongst the darkness. This is cinema at its most meditative and beautiful, especially with the wonderful score that chimes in at just the right times. The film goes down in my book for one of the best uses of a particular piece of music, in this case, the film's frequent use of The Blue Danube. There's so much in 2001 A Space Odyssey, between its visuals, its score, its themes, and its commentary, that it easily warrants more viewings, which I plan to get on in the future. This is the kind of film I can see doing different things for me at different points in my life. Perhaps a second viewing will assure its themes, which I'm still trying to grasp and understand, become more vivid and clearer, where maybe a viewing when I'm an adult affirms realities about the world around us. I'm optimistic for the film to progressively get more insightful and more enriching as time goes on; that's one thing many modern, big-budget films boasting grandiose visuals and effects have a difficult time with.Starring Keir Dullea, Gary Lockwood, William Sylvester, and Douglas Rain.

Even as computer-generated imagery (CGI) has given animation, action films, and fantasy pictures an antiseptic sleekness and a practical way to showcase certain unforeseen sequences as if they could really happen, films like Star Trek A Motion Picture, its corresponding TV series, and 2001 A Space Odyssey existed in a time where amateurish special effects where what was predominately available. Director Stanley Kubrick and the studio of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM), however, found sources to provide beautiful and limitless cinematography and special effects work in order to bring space into theaters all over the world. This achievement alone is enough to warrant 2001's placement amongst some of the most important films of all time.That's just what 2001 is - one of the most significant films ever made. Its use of special effects is incredible, its themes ranging from existentialism to human and mankind's value in the face of excelling technology, its developed and authentic style showcasing space exploration, and its use of detailed visuals all make its placement on such a list a worthy one. Too many people get caught up in trying to find the best films that they forget about the ones that made splashes, which circumvented into impacts, game-changers, and iconic works. 2001 is an iconic work from a director who, had he never touched cinema, may've set cinema back several years.The film is divided into four vignettes that detail man's interactions with advanced and incalculably valuable Monoliths, otherwise known as high-powered machines that do much of the thinking for humans when it comes to space travel and exploration. The first vignette concerns the dawn of man, following ape-like beings trying to find food in a vast desert, the second concerns passengers aboard a Pan-AM space plane that learn of an epidemic occurring at one of the Lunar bases they're destined to come in contact with, the third and longest shows a group of scientists traveling aboard the spacecraft Discovery One, joined by the advanced, supercomputer HAL 9000, a machine that should be helping them on their journey to Jupiter but instead seems to be hindering them, and the fourth concerns Jupiter and beyond.Each of these vignettes could easily spawn individual reviews, and because of that, it's difficult to look at 2001 A Space Odyssey as an entire project. In one-hundred and forty-eight minutes, the film manages to be often enthralling, wondrous, and on occasions, maddening, as some scenes shine and other scenes seem to drag. But all is well, as there is always something occurring in Kubrick's realm of directorial flair and Geoffrey Unsworth's unmatchable cinematography.With all the praise 2001's visuals have earned, it seems like nothing more than a waste of time to address them once again, but they must be. Unsworth's detail is simply exquisite, whether he is showing the vast openness and emptiness of space or he is showing the calculated quarters of these large and sometimes quite ominous spacecrafts. Pay attention to Kubrick and Unsworth's use of the color red, as it often is used to denote fear, vulnerability, and uncertainty. In addition, consider some of the unique and trickier visual sequences, such as the famous Star-Gate scene, where thousands and thousands of colors hit the screen at once, causing a mass amount of pressure and unbelievable visual annihilation on ones retinas.

It's more clear that the film wouldn't have drawn the same attention without it; JFK wouldn't have had to cross picket lines to see the film.The message is that only when you embody the idea does it acquire presence and truth, more interesting this. We can see this in the film here, the one that ended the blacklist. No court decided prior, the film revolted anyway, dismantling it in practice. And why this film? The ground was of course prepared by circumstances but still why this and not any other? Because its own push is against intolerance and oppression written by someone who actually embodied its message in his own story. It's not however a view to really contemplate now; we still have heroes and villains on clear sides, an unambiguous struggle against evil. It's not, only because this particular evil is now, or seems now, to be much more distant than even then.Kubrick was the latest addition to the fold, hired on two days notice and with production already underway (the Libyan scenes had been filmed).It's easy to see what he may have balked at to the point of later disowning the work, and easy to retrospectively think that had it not been for Douglas this would have been a 2001 or Barry Lyndon of epics. But this was still 1960 so just as L'Avventura (and soon Marienbad) were redefining the planes of narrative. My notion is that Kubrick had as much of an ego as Douglas and simply disowned this for not having overseen every single element, it doesn't look 'ruined' in some way.Kubrick does solid work in the classical scenes of the epic, more so for someone so young who came into it so late. I saw it together with Fall of the Roman Empire (by the guy who was fired by this) and there's a clear difference, that one stale, this energetic.His real work however is in the sculpting of a more embodied space to have presence.

Kubrick extends in the eye.During the bouts in the gladiatorial school for the indifferent amusement of Roman visitors, we stay with Spartacus in the wooden box and watch the first pair fight through planks of wood. Another is after Spartacus has amassed his makeshift army, as Douglas gives one of his speeches our eye wanders off among the crowd. The whispered seduction in the bath and that is followed by a view of the legions quietly tiptoeing out of Rome at dawn. All well known scenes, all of them about creating presence. We've taken the next step to where they are now commonplace and perhaps disappear in the spectacle, for the time though they were more forward-looking than usual in this niche.

Spy Kids. Those films generally paint two portraits of the spy life. Either glamorous and exotic, or intense and brutal. Nikita is an interesting film in the genre. While it certainly leans more towards the latter, it's one of the very films in the genre that both shows a realistic depiction of spy life but at the same time, stylizes it. But does Nikita work as a film? Let's find out.The plot follows a teenage junkie by the name of Nikita, who gets arrested one night after partaking in a drug store robbery that goes horribly wrong where she murders a policeman in cold-blood, making her guilty of serving a life sentence. However, the French government fakes a suicide for her to become a spy\/assassin.What's interesting about Nikita is its look into the life of a spy. This isn't James Bond, there's no gadgets, no witty one-liners, and no larger-than-life villains. What we have INSTEAD, is a look into a woman being turned by the French government from a teenage junkie to a dangerous killing machine. Nikita is a woman who starts out with no meaning in life as she hangs around with junkies and is addicted to drugs herself but after she's trained to be a spy, she becomes a lethal killing machine but in the meantime, becomes refined, mentally stable, and even attractive. What's interesting about this is the MORALITY. On one hand, she MURDERED a policeman, so she deserves punishment but at the same time, once she gets out of spy school, she cares and appreciates not just for her life, but also for society and towards the END, she ditches her mission and runs away to leave the life of a spy. The film's message can be pretty much be chalked up to everybody deserves a second chance and it's delivered beautifully because it's not RAMMED down your throat with lines like Maybe Nikita, deserves another chance. Maybe, she never deserved this in the first place. which would have dumbed down the entire movie.Outside of the morality behind the film, Nikita is also very stylish. Director Luc Besson directs this film with a strange mix of realism and style but somehow, it works! This movie has its fair share of brutal realism with scenes like the Cleaner using acid to melt down the bodies of those he killed or Nikita trying to break out by threatening her supervisor, Bob, at gunpoint but there's also scenes of style such as the speech her instructor, Amande tells about femininity and the means of using it or the scenes of Nikita training comically in spy school. The reason this works is because neither styles go too far, so they end up complimenting each other and creating its own style rather than making for something inconsistent and jarring. The cinematography by Thierry Arbogast is also quite good at creating this gritty, stylized look.But with all that good said, this is not a perfect movie. One of its biggest flaws is the confused timeframe presented in the story. The movie spans over years of Nikita training to become a spy but the way it's edited makes it feel like only a few weeks\/months have gone by so when one of the heads of the organization says Nikita has been training here for six years., you'll just be left sitting there like Wait, it's been six years?Another problem is the character of Marco. He's just really bland and uninteresting throughout. He's supposed to be the man who wins Nikita's heart and make her appreciate life more but the thing is, while he seems like a really nice guy, his interactions with Nikita aren't very interesting. He questions her here and there about things like why she never has friends or family over at her place or why she spends so much time in the bathroom ignoring him but it never amounts to anything more than that. I would've liked to see him actually get MAD at her at one point and have an argument play out, I think that would've been a little more interesting.The last of the major problems is the score by Eric Serra. It just sounds incredibly bland and sterile throughout. There's some scenes in the film where I literally felt like ripping my HAIR out because of how mind-inducingly dull it is. Although, I did like the music when the Cleaner was taking care of business.However, those problems aren't NEARLY strong enough to ruin the film because of the excellent cast. Anne Parillaud gives a truly spectacular performance as Nikita. Her change from teenage junkie to refined assassin is very believable and all her conflicting emotions about being a spy feel very real and believable. Tcheky Karyo plays Bob fascinatingly with a polite persona but with an underlying intensity that makes you really think and question his feelings towards Nikita effectively. While I thought his character was a little bland, Jean- Hugues Anglade does the best he can as Marco and remains likable the entire film. Lastly, while the Cleaner doesn't get a whole lot of screen time, Reno stands out as a cool and bada$$ character in the film.Overall, while it has some issues regarding the timeframe, the character of Marco, and the score. Nikita is still an interesting character study with stylish direction and an excellent cast. 8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"23 April 2014","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" When it comes to spy cinema, Americans generally know it through franchises like James Bond, Mission Impossible, the Bourne series, and...

Maybe, she never deserved this in the first place. which would have dumbed down the entire movie.Outside of the morality behind the film, Nikita is also very stylish. Director Luc Besson directs this film with a strange mix of realism and style but somehow, it works! This movie has its fair share of brutal realism with scenes like the Cleaner using acid to melt down the bodies of those he killed or Nikita trying to break out by threatening her supervisor, Bob, at gunpoint but there's also scenes of style such as the speech her instructor, Amande tells about femininity and the means of using it or the scenes of Nikita training comically in spy school. The reason this works is because neither styles go too far, so they end up complimenting each other and creating its own style rather than making for something inconsistent and jarring. The cinematography by Thierry Arbogast is also quite good at creating this gritty, stylized look.But with all that good said, this is not a perfect movie. One of its biggest flaws is the confused timeframe presented in the story. The movie spans over years of Nikita training to become a spy but the way it's edited makes it feel like only a few weeks\/months have gone by so when one of the heads of the organization says Nikita has been training here for six years., you'll just be left sitting there like Wait, it's been six years?Another problem is the character of Marco. He's just really bland and uninteresting throughout. He's supposed to be the man who wins Nikita's heart and make her appreciate life more but the thing is, while he seems like a really nice guy, his interactions with Nikita aren't very interesting. He questions her here and there about things like why she never has friends or family over at her place or why she spends so much time in the bathroom ignoring him but it never amounts to anything more than that. I would've liked to see him actually get MAD at her at one point and have an argument play out, I think that would've been a little more interesting.The last of the major problems is the score by Eric Serra. It just sounds incredibly bland and sterile throughout. There's some scenes in the film where I literally felt like ripping my HAIR out because of how mind-inducingly dull it is. Although, I did like the music when the Cleaner was taking care of business.However, those problems aren't NEARLY strong enough to ruin the film because of the excellent cast. Anne Parillaud gives a truly spectacular performance as Nikita. Her change from teenage junkie to refined assassin is very believable and all her conflicting emotions about being a spy feel very real and believable. Tcheky Karyo plays Bob fascinatingly with a polite persona but with an underlying intensity that makes you really think and question his feelings towards Nikita effectively. While I thought his character was a little bland, Jean- Hugues Anglade does the best he can as Marco and remains likable the entire film. Lastly, while the Cleaner doesn't get a whole lot of screen time, Reno stands out as a cool and bada$$ character in the film.Overall, while it has some issues regarding the timeframe, the character of Marco, and the score. Nikita is still an interesting character study with stylish direction and an excellent cast. 8\/10 ","genre":"Action, Thriller"},{"date":"23 April 2014","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Alfred Hitchcock's Rope is based on a play which is based on a true story about the murder of Bobby Franks, a 14 year old boy who was strangled in 1922 by a duo called Leopald and Loeb. Hitchcock called this film an experiment that failed. But it will go down in history as the pre-cursor to the Spanish horror film The Silent House and Its inferior American Remake.The story follows Brandon, a genius, and Phillip, a neurotic wussy boy who strangle a man to death and hide him in a table. They then invite a bunch of people over including James Stewart's Rupert Cadall. A House Master that is a threat to Phillip as he thinks Rupert is going to find the body.This is a work of art. The film has a max of 10 shots. Each ranging from 9 to 15 minutes long. The film is one of the first to take place in real time and it works quite well for its age.James Stewart is one of the greatest things about Rope. His performance is fantastic as Rupert. This character is also written very well as he finds holes in the two's murder plot making him one of the smartest characters of the 40's.The problem I had with this film, is that the movie is only 80 minutes long. I think Hitchcock's imagination is limited here because its an adaptation of a play of the same name. But if his cleverness could of made 10 more minutes with an epilogue saying what happened to Brandon and Phillip, then it would have made the movie better.This is a film about dialog. Lots of it. They do not change the setting one bit. It is the same room for the next 80 minutes and they use it well. If you look hard enough, you can actually see some cameos by director Hitchcock himself. The film is written by Arthur Laurents and does a fantastic job with the screenplay. It must be really hard trying to get 15 minutes of footage in one shot.Rope has become a classic like other Hitchcock films over the last half century. Its techniques, its plot, its characters are all strongly amusing and will not keep your eyes off the screen. It is one of the classics.

In the case of Star Trek Generations, the same can be said, only this time it's the creators of the film who have the ludicrous ideas that focus more on what they want or what they think fans want than what would work out well. This film is probably what a lot of Trekkies have dreamed of. The movie or TV episode where James T. Kirk (William Shatner) from the original series and Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) from TNG would team up to stop a villain. The film focuses more on the basic premise that these two legendary star ship captains must work together than making a movie with a good story that would have worked to have the crew of TNG series solely in it. Starting off at some point in between The Undiscovered Country and TNG, Kirk and a few remaining members of his crew are welcomed as guests for the maiden voyage of the Enterprise-B. During its voyage, the star ship receives an distress signal and investigates it, discovering a ship that is about to be destroyed by an energy ribbon and beams the survivors aboard, including a man who wants to enter the energy ribbon, Dr. Soran (Malcolm McDowell). The Enterprise gets caught in the ribbon and in a successful effort to save the ship, Captain Kirk is feared dead.Cut to 78 years later on board the Enterprise-D, under the command of Picard. On board, the android Data (Brent Spiner) has an emotions chip implanted into him so he can feel more human while Captain Picard learns that his family has recently perished in a fire. The crew runs into Dr. Soran who is planning on entering the energy ribbon to a place called the Nexus, which is described as a place of joy. Picard attempts to stop him, but he is unable to and both Soran and Picard are swallowed by the Nexus. In the Nexus, Picard discovers Kirk and the two form up to go back to stop Soran, as there is no sense of time in the Nexus, and stop him from changing the Nexus' course to enter it because by doing so, it will destroy a planet.The subplot involving Data learning to adjust to the emotions chip is not particularly interesting and is used not so much to develop Data as a character, but more for him to be a source of comic relief by doing a number of things that make us laugh at the movie, not with the movie. Ironically, the only time I laughed at anything Data did in this film was the one time I was told it was not funny, which was when he pushed Dr. Crusher (Gates McFadden) into the water on the holodeck after a misunderstanding.Fortunately, the fan-fiction part is only the last twenty minutes or so, and the combination of Kirk and Picard isn't all that bad, the mission and their plan makes no sense. After meeting up in the Nexus, they go back to right before Soran changes the ribbon's course so they have a race against the clock. Next, they act as though they have one chance when in actuality, they could keep entering the Nexus and coming out to try again until they got it right. Next, Picard could have gone back to the day he rescued Soran and prevented him from going through with his mission while Kirk went back to his time via the Nexus. When there are three much more probable options that could have been used but were not for the sake of seeing Picard and Kirk work together to stop a bad guy, it's not only insulting to the audience's intelligence, it is insulting to the characters of Picard and Kirk intelligence because in the past, they have been shown to to come up with better plans in less time than they had.Star Trek Generations is easily the worst film out of all twelve Star Trek films.

There is little character development, so right away the entire production becomes a so what. If you like films that insult your intelligence, then Firestorm is for you. If however, you demand some believability in your entertainment then this is one to avoid for certain. Ridiculous stunts do not a movie make. Beware! - MERK ","genre":"Thriller, Action"},{"date":"23 April 2014","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Alcoholics or drug addicts feel wrong when they don't feel right. Eventually they feel very wrong, and must feel right, and at that point their lives spiral down into some sort of final chapter--recovery if they're lucky, hopelessness and death if they're not.What is fascinating about Requiem for a Dream, the new film by Darren Aronofsky, is how well he portrays the mental states of his addicts. When they use, a window opens briefly into a world where everything is right. Then it slides shut, and life reduces itself to a search for the money and drugs to open it again. Nothing else is remotely as interesting.Aronofsky is the director who made the hallucinatory Pi (1998), about a paranoid genius who seems on the brink of discovering the key to--well, God, or the stock market, or whatever else his tormentors imagine. That movie, made on a tiny budget, was astonishing in the way it suggested its hero's shifting prism of reality. Now, with greater resources, Aronofsky brings a new urgency to the drug movie by trying to reproduce, through his subjective camera, how his characters feel, or want to feel, or fear to feel.As the movie opens, a housewife is chaining her television to the radiator. It's no use. Her son frees it, and wheels it down the street to a pawn shop. This is a regular routine, we gather; anything in his mother's house is a potential source of funds for drug money. The son's girlfriend and best friend are both addicted, too. So is the mother to television and sugar. We recognize the actors, but barely. Sara Goldfarb (Ellen Burstyn) is fat and blowzy in her sloppy house dresses; if you've just seen her in the revived Exorcist, her appearance will come as a shock. Her son Harry (Jared Leto) is gaunt and haunted; so is his girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly). His pal Tyrone is played by Marlon Wayans, who has lost all the energy and cockiness of his comic persona and is simply trying to survive in a reasonable manner. Tyrone suspects, correctly, that he's in trouble but Harry is in more.Sara's life passes in modest retirement. She joins the other old ladies out front of their building, where they line up their lawn chairs in the sun. She's addicted to a game show whose host (Christopher McDonald) leads the audience in chanting We got a winner! She's a sweet, naive women who gets a junk phone call that misleads her into thinking she may be a potential guest on the show. She obsesses about wearing her favourite red dress, and gets diet pills from the doctor to help her lose weight.She does lose weight, and also her mind. The pills don't work so good anymore, she complains to the druggist, and then starts doubling up her usage. Her doctor isn't even paying attention when she complains dubiously about hallucinations (the refrigerator has started to threaten her). Meanwhile, Harry talks to Marion about the one big score that would get us back on track. Tyrone can see that Harry is losing it, but Marion, under Harry's spell, has sex with a shrink (Sean Gullette, star of Pi) and is eventually selling herself for stag party gang-gropes.Aronofsky is fascinated by the way in which the camera can be used to suggest how his characters see things. I've just finished a shot-by-shot analysis of Hitchcock's The Birds at the Virginia Film Festival; he does the same thing, showing us some things and denying us others so that we are first plunged into a subjective state and then yanked back to objectivity with a splash of cold reality.Here Aronofsky uses extreme close-ups to show drugs acting on his characters. First we see the pills, or the fix, filling the screen, because that's all the characters can think about. Then the injection, swallowing or sniffing--because that blots out the world. Then the pupils of their eyes dilate. All done with acute exaggeration of sounds.These sequences are done in fast-motion, to show how quickly the drugs take effect--and how disappointingly soon they fade. The in-between times edge toward desperation. Aronofsky cuts between the mother, a prisoner of her apartment and diet pills, and the other three. Early in the film, in a technique I haven't seen before, he uses a split screen in which the space on both sides is available to the other (Sara and Harry each have half the screen, but their movements enter into each other's halves). This is an effective way of showing them alone together. Later, in a virtuoso closing sequence, he cuts between all four major characters as they careen toward their final destinations.Burstyn isn't afraid to play Sara Goldfarb flat-out as a collapsing ruin (Aronofsky has mercy on her by giving her some fantasy scenes where she appears on TV and we see that she is actually still a great-looking woman). Connolly, who is so much a sex symbol that she, too, could have disgraced herself in Charlie's Angels, has consistently gone for risky projects and this may be her riskiest; the movie is inspired by Hubert Selby, Jr.'s lacerating novel of the same name, and in her own way Connolly goes as far as Jennifer Jason Leigh did in Last Exit to Brooklyn (1989), an equally courageous, quite different, film based on another Selby novel. Leto and Wayans have a road trip together, heading for Florida, that is like a bleaker echo of Joe Buck and Ratso Rizzo's Florida odyssey in Midnight Cowboy. Leto's suppurating arm, punished by too many needles, is like a motif for his life.

Seriously! A bunch of 'em!We'll gloss quickly over just a few of the many opening idiocies - that, in order to generate enough atmosphere to (momentarily) overcome the natural gravitational leakage of Mars, the algae would have to eat nothing but rock, cover the entire surface of the planet a foot deep and probably run through every drop of water in both polar ice caps in about a week; that this air would last about another week after the algae died; that the main spacecraft was so poorly designed and badly shielded, it couldn't handle being smacked into by a simple wave of solar radiation and maybe a few piddly micrometeorites; that their emergency so-called landing system was among the most moronic concepts NASA ever dismissed out-of-hand without a second thought - and move right on to the biggest bit of REALLY astounding stupidity....Okay, so they've crash-landed on Mars. They now have a trudge of unknown distance ahead of them, a severely limited air supply and a colleague with life-threatening injuries. (At this point in the script, they're not yet aware that the Habitat has already been trashed. More brainlessness - like simple telemetry couldn't have told them that before they even left Earth??) But, not to worry, they've also brought along a sophisticated piece of hardware which can probably save ALL their lives. The AMEE unit is entirely self-powered and self-propelled, can run at speeds approaching 50 clicks an hour and has servo motors clearly serious enough to carry a pretty hefty load, particularly under Martian gravity.Like, maybe, a wounded man in a spacesuit, for example...?But is this brain-trust (more like brain-rust!) smart enough to use it properly? Sadly, no. Not even their engineer, Val Kilmer, thinks to simply say, AMEE? Would you please run on ahead and find the Habitat, then come back and guide us to it while carrying Professor Ruptured-Spleen, here? Oh, and, while you're at it, please bring back some full air tanks and a water bottle or two. There's a good girl...She was a borrowed military device.
