The movie also tried to portray some of the D&D steriotypes; such as dwarfs. In the game, dwarfs are fearless, hard drinkers, and hate horses.

But if you are with someone, you fear that those things will happen; or if they don't, you look into the future and think Wow, those two were together for so long and they fell apart from each other. I had my mother watch this movie who was married twice, and married to my father for 17 years.  When she watched it, she was quiet through the entire thing, and sort of shook her head alot.  In the end, she simply said This is how it is...those are the thoughts you think, and the process of losing everything.

Arnofsky's sophomore effort is overstylized and snazzy, but it's good to see that he has talent in his style.  The faults?  The script is rather unsensational, the acting is good enough but never as good as it could have been.

But other than that, the film is excellent and sometimes exceptional.  I don't think that I've ever seen such a harrowing, disturbing film.  Even when you think you can't stand to watch, you are always compelled to.  Arnofsky's style is awesome original and effective in creating the tone for the film.

I don't think that the film is deserving of the NC-17 rating (or the adults only policy being enforced) like some other films which deserve it, since a powerful lesson is to be learned from Requiem.

Which is just as well, because otherwise you'd have a hard time putting up with the rest that appears on screen.The cheerleading sequences are quite impressive - it's a bit of a pity the remainder of the film isn't quite up to the same calibre.  Don't get me wrong - it's fun, but you can't help wishing for something more.  The characters speak like they're showing off to the camera, instead of just speaking like any normal teenager would, which gets annoying rather quickly.  Also the attempts to try and give cheerleading a send up with the cheerleaders complaing that Torrance is running a 'cheerocracy' and is being a 'cheertator', and later on that she's having 'cheersex' with a guy in the audience fails to find many laughs at all.Anyway, the cheerleading sequences are tops (as mentioned above).  Dunst looks nice and cute as Torrance, but her character suffers from all the usual gimmicks and cliches that are seen in countless other teenage films (usually related to what is known as 'idiot plot' syndrome).  The real standouts are Eliza Dushku and Gabrielle Union, who at times bring an air of reality to their characters - Dushku being the rebel who wonders what all the fuss is about, and Union the captain who just wants to give her team the best chance she can give it.  It probably helps that they're supporting characters as well, meaning they don't have to be on the screen as much as Dunst (who at times struggles to keep her character afloat).All up, 'Bring It On' is an enjoyable romp, but I think a viewer would get the most out of it if they happen to be a fan of any of the leading actors mentioned above.  Otherwise it's yet another teenage\/sports film with a twist (and some pretty good cheerleading sequences).3.5 out of 5 ","genre":null},{"date":"15 December 2000","score":"","review":"  Within the first 5 minutes you know that the film isn't supposed to be taken seriously.

Apparently they want him dead before he releases the virus on the world. (And don't say they didn't give Willis the gun to kill him. What was he going to do, request a sample of the virus at gunpoint, then tell Boomer to 'go about your business'? No.)Die Hard man dies in his failed attempt. The virus is released. Lo and behold, The insurance lady comes by just in time to save the day. After the virus is released. I guess to get the original virus so they can develop an antidote in the future. Maybe to stop the further spread before Boomer gets off the plane in another country.So, dear readers, why are they bothering to give (what you talkin' bout) willis a gun to stop boomer at the last possible second? They can go to any time they want. They've done it before. Why not just kill boomer at any time before he takes the virus and be done with it? Run him over with a car on his 18th birthday? Accidental drug overdose while in college? Hey, you've got 40 years to work with, be creative!Think about it. Would you, wanting to stop a deadly virus from wiping out humanity, place all your bets on a 15 minute window of opportunity while Boomer is in the airport, or any of the 40 years of his life leading up to that point? Did they think viewers wouldn't be able to comprehend one more jump back to a different time, or did they just want to maintain the 'dark' part of their film, at the expense of the logic they themselves have set up?I've seen comments from fans of this movie that attack anyone who doesn't like it. I wanted to like it, that's why I bought a ticket. The problem is if you get your viewers to suspend disbelief for your movie, you need to give them a set of rules to believe in for the duration of your movie. You can't then suspend the rules you've set up and expect your movie not to have a fatal flaw, and this movie has a big one. ","genre":"Mystery, Sci-Fi, Thriller"}]
