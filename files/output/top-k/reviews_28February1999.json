His character is very believable and interesting as self-employed private investigators are quite an upstart industry now in the United States.The only problem I had with the first hour or so of the movie was the scene where the billionairess introduces him to his case (shows him the 8mm home movie and sets the plot in motion). I thought Joel Scumacher would have made this part of the movie the most interesting, yet I think it is grossly overshadowed by Cage discovering the underground porno-lifestyle so accurately depicted in this film which consumes most of Los Angeles.You wont find any B.S. sterotypes in this film, it's gritty and factual and is just what America needs to go see especially if you like Seven, Kiss the Girls, or are interested in movies which show the true side of life most common city people are forced to realize. The idea of having a story unfold of this calibre and nature, covering this material, could only come from Joel Schumacher (see FALLING DOWN). He can show you a side of L.A. most movies just brush under the carpet. It was also interesting to see Joaquin Phoenix - he is a very talented young actor. His lines in 8mm complement the plot and he seems perfect - especially the way he and Cage interact sort of like a big brother\/little brother relationship.What I did not like about this film is that there were no major twists like in Seven.. Movie addicts will recognize Chris Bauer (Mr.Gettys) from the Devil's advocate as the The Machine and Dino Velvet (Peter Stormare, Armageddon) the sick for hire snuff film director in 8mm. Bottom Line This movie is very interesting and worth seeing several times, especially if you are a Nick Cage Fan.

Out of all of Elmore's novels turned films I believe that Out of Sight stays true to its nature and story best.

There was no A to B in this film; it jumps around without telling you, but soon enough you get used to it and start to enjoy it.  I found the movie extremely enjoyable, but I have heard from people that they think it dragged - I disagree; it's an excellent story that keeps the audience interested from Clooney's first on screen bank robbery to his meeting with none other than Sam Jackson himself - another interesting aspect was using Michael Keaton to play, a slightly different, Ray Nicholet once again.  I believe the Michael and Sam were not in the credits - oh well.  All in all it was an excellent movie and I urge anyone that enjoys a good story, particularily a good crime story to go and see this movie - Clooney is the coolest, calmest gangster in the world.

In his little masterpieces, he puts together beautiful photography, sentimental music (his other passion), and enthralling characters. He has covered a range of genres in his career, from action, westerns, suspense, and even musical biographies. The realm of romance is a new venture for Clint, and he follows through with it brilliantly. The Bridges of Madison County is Eastwood's foray into a different part of America's heartland, geographically and spiritually. Robert Kincaid (Eastwood) is a photographer for National Geographic who goes out on assignment to shoot the covered bridges of Iowa's Madison County. Through asking directions, he meets up with Francesca Johnson (Meryl Streep, in another fine performance), a farm housewife. What separates this story from all other romances is that they are concerned their running away together will tarnish what strong feelings they already have for each other. Sometimes, the will of the spirit is greater than all else. Clint sculpts some amazingly lush and picturesque scenes, using landscape and atmosphere to his advantage. He is accompanied by a gorgeous score, composed by himself with Lennie Niehaus, simple but fitting to the background. I've often had a struggle trying to prove that Eastwood is more than just a make my day stereotype, but a real actor with real characters and real style. With Streep, I've had much less of a problem backing up the same argument. She is much more than just an actress sporting another accent each time she steps in front of a camera. I rank these two among the best in the business, having a genuine love for what they provide to an audience. This radiates with every scene they create, expertly and feelingly. It's very simple and very difficult to explain how romances are able to work for an audience without implying that it is delivering corn or crap. All I can establish is that if you can feel the chemistry working between the couple on the screen, it gets you every time. Bridges works for me big time, not just because I idolize these two stars, but because I got an intense calling back to the golden age of cinema, where you could cut the intensity of the actors with a knife. Eastwood and Streep show that they have learned from the days of classical cinema, revealing to us that the old ways still work and still pack a wallop. The Bridges of Madison County is a masterpiece, carefully crafted, lovingly performed and shot, and touchingly expressed. This is one of the best films of 1995. Rating Four stars.

I'm not a fan of Shakespeare, though I do appreciate the artistry of his works, and therefore much of the magic of this movie was lost on me. And that means what was left for me to see on the screen was a very middle-of-the-road romantic comedy with a plot right out of The Mighty Ducks, or any other come-from-behind sport movie you can think of. You've got a group of misfit actors (hockey players, baseball players, football players etc.) with a leader who's viewed as a loser by the public at large. He loves a girl who is dating a total jerk but because of social pressure their true love is to be denied. The home team is about to lose everything-- they can't get fans to pack the stands and are about to go out of business. Somehow Our Hero must turn his lovable band of losers into a cohesive team which he does through a series of wacky encounters. He even manages picks up supporters who were formerly against him, but see what he is trying to accomplish and lend their support. After much preparation, things look like they are going to fall into place. But right before the big game plans fall apart and the mood turns dark the girlfriend is going to run off with the jock.

The home team pulls out a stunning victory by pure strength of heart that gets a standing-o from the spectators.

An even higher power (which usually makes an appearance earlier in the film expressing only a mild interest in the game) shows up out of NOWHERE to publicly humiliate the bad guys and to validate the victory of the ragtag band of misfits who worked so hard to accomplish their goals.This is a very cynical take on the film, but if you think about it, I think you'll agree that the plot is a very standard by-the-numbers affair.

We must have the same sense of humor since I find her movies to be not only funny, but with deep content. At home we use expressions such as, What is it with women and pillows?(Mixed Nuts), What is it called when all lines intersect? The Bermuda Triangle (Sleepless in Seattle), You are the first thing I want to see in the morning and the last thing I want to see before I go to bed (When Harry Met Sally). Meg Ryan was nominated for a Globe Awards for the part. She did a good job in this movie. Tom Hanks is just great! I read comments where people think that they are getting old to play those type of roles. I do not take that view, since there is no statute of limitations for falling in love.  At least I have not heard of one! Even though I do not like to compare movies, You've Got Mail is very Ephron. Getting trapped in the elevator, cute kids and cute dogs, the NY scenery in different seasons,the beautiful garden where Shopgirl and NYxxxx really meet, this is all true Ephron.

I am not a fanatic about the actual ship; my reaction has always been, It's a big ship, it sank.  So what?  Back on opening day, though some rave reviews had already come out, some dissenting views had also come, and while interest was expected, no one knew the ultimate fate of the movie.  And at the theater I saw it in, the projector broke down three times in the first five minutes, and I think it's safe to say the audience I saw it with was ready to kill.  Then, finally, the movie went on interrupted.By the end, though we of course took the free passes the theater provided us to apologize for our inconvenience, we were transfixed by what we had seen on screen.  James Cameron is a director who tries here to make art out of pure entertainment, and he suceeds on a massive scale.  There were better movies in 1997(TITANIC was #8 on my top ten list that year; the first seven were, in order, THE SWEET HEREAFTER, L.A. CONFIDENTIAL, AS GOOD AS IT GETS, THE ICE STORM, ULEE'S GOLD, IN THE COMPANY OF MEN, and GROSSE POINTE BLANK), but this was the best pure entertainment of the year.  The physical achievement of the movie, of course, is not to be forgotten, particularly when the ship sinks, and the scene where Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Rose(Kate Winslet) are standing in the front of the boat (the I'm flying! scene), which, when I saw it in the trailer, was what made me want to see the movie.  But the love story worked for me as well, as did the wrap-around story of the old Rose (Gloria Stuart) remembering when she was in the heart of the ocean.  DiCaprio is a good actor, and he's good here, though a bit too modern for me, but it's Winslet who gives the movie its heart, playing passion to the hilt.But as the 70's were the Me Decade, and the 80's were the Greed Decade, the 90's can probably best be described as the Backlash Decade.  As soon as a work or artist in popular culture (American anyway) becomes popular, it seems people have a felt need to line up and dump on it simply because a lot of other people like it, and they can't stand it.  This is not to say all popular culture is good.  Rather, it is to argue that just because a lot of people like something doesn't automatically make it bad.  This is not the movie of the year, the decade, or the century, but it's a great movie, and I wish people would get over themselves and not consider those of us who feel like I do cretins.

This movie can't be compared with Saving Private Ryan. If Saving Private Ryan showed us the cruelty of war, The Thin Red Line made us venture into the consciousness\/conscience of the soldiers who were directly in it. This movie is SO INTIMATE and thought provoking. Some will even argue how can a war movie can be so SLOW like The Thin Red Line. On this, I have to tell them that they have missed the point. This movie in its entirety tried to convey to the audience how some of those soldiers were thinking, feeling and acting during those unforgiving times. Saving Private Ryan made us abhor the war while The Thin Red Line will not only make you hate and feel the war but will also make you symphatize and emphatize with the victims of war - be it humans or nature. It will give you a glimpse on different points of views of soldiers while in war. I liked the visuals very much and the short battle scene on the hill - it was very tense and scary indeed. The sonics was not on par with Saving Private Ryan while the battle scene reminded me of Forrest Gump. I will not venture into the technicalities as I am not very good at it. The actors are convincing specially caviezel (pvt witt) whose face I really admired. He looked like very 'resolved' and it seems that he knows that he is in a war but can't really justify WHY he and the rest are in it! His thoughts were very philosophical.

Some of this is due to the weak story and others are due to the horrible acting and characterization.We meet Shakespeare who is travelling from rebuilt town to rebuilt town after nuclear war has apparently destroyed the country and the government.  From seeing this movie for about 1.5 hours and listening to Costner drawl such idiotic lines as You're really weird! and Things are getting better... they're getting better every day we are apparently supposed to understand that Costner's character is a slow and unintelligent character, yet he is somehow able to cajole the towns' citizens into believing in his story.  I have yet to read the novel but I suppose the author was trying to get across that his character is a stupid dullard who inadvertently saves the new world, but Costner's inconsistent acting and the unbelievable way in which the citizens take his story as gospel (President Starky?) just falls right on the floor.As for the story, how are we to believe that a man, through self-help books and affected speech, is able to lead a marauding bunch of kidnapped men into looting, raping, and killing their own people?  I had thought beforehand that this story would have been a legitimate post-apocalyptic epic, since you'd think that when a country was destroyed you'd have enough problems rebuilding the nation and re-establishing communications.  Instead, we are faced with a pathetic story about an unjust paramilitary leader who needs to get his clock cleaned and can't perform in the bedroom (which is also apparently another source of his anger).  I thought for a moment I was watching Conan the Barbarian the way the army attacks and destroys rebuilt communities, with Bethlehem sitting like a king getting offered treasures in return for his clemency.  How pathetic!I was hoping for a good post-apocalyptic epic, but it turned into another Dances With Wolves with a cheapened plot based on a recycled insane-bad-guy-tries-to-get-rich story we've seen countless times before. The Road Warrior gave good reason for the insanity.  The Postman just couldn't.On the bright side, the ideas and mechanisms of a rebuilt nation are very interesting and could have carried the movie without any need for marauding hun-like armies.  The Hoover dam, the complete lack of working automobiles, the talk of illnesses caused by the nuclear holocaust, more talk about promised lands on the other side of the mountains, perhaps even finally communicating with the rest of the rebuilt nation, would have made this a fine movie.  Instead we are left with an expensive remake of Mad Max, complete with cheap bad guys whom the author and director think unwashed movie-going masses need in every movie.  Apparently, this is because the hardship of the new world isn't enough of an antagonist, and movie-goers wouldn't be able to accept that as enough of a challenge.If you enjoy post-apocalyptic epic films, you will be sorely disappointed in this film's shallowness, lack of characterization, and unbelievable antagonist.

Like others I'm a big fan of the post-apocalyptic genre and this movie treated that concept both with ineptitude and with some competence.  Some of this is due to the weak story and others are due to the horrible acting and characterization.We meet Shakespeare who is travelling from rebuilt town to rebuilt town after nuclear war has apparently destroyed the country and the government.  From seeing this movie for about 1.5 hours and listening to Costner drawl such idiotic lines as You're really weird! and Things are getting better... they're getting better every day we are apparently supposed to understand that Costner's character is a slow and unintelligent character, yet he is somehow able to cajole the towns' citizens into believing in his story.  I have yet to read the novel but I suppose the author was trying to get across that his character is a stupid dullard who inadvertently saves the new world, but Costner's inconsistent acting and the unbelievable way in which the citizens take his story as gospel (President Starky?) just falls right on the floor.As for the story, how are we to believe that a man, through self-help books and affected speech, is able to lead a marauding bunch of kidnapped men into looting, raping, and killing their own people?  I had thought beforehand that this story would have been a legitimate post-apocalyptic epic, since you'd think that when a country was destroyed you'd have enough problems rebuilding the nation and re-establishing communications.  Instead, we are faced with a pathetic story about an unjust paramilitary leader who needs to get his clock cleaned and can't perform in the bedroom (which is also apparently another source of his anger).  I thought for a moment I was watching Conan the Barbarian the way the army attacks and destroys rebuilt communities, with Bethlehem sitting like a king getting offered treasures in return for his clemency.  How pathetic!I was hoping for a good post-apocalyptic epic, but it turned into another Dances With Wolves with a cheapened plot based on a recycled insane-bad-guy-tries-to-get-rich story we've seen countless times before. The Road Warrior gave good reason for the insanity.  The Postman just couldn't.On the bright side, the ideas and mechanisms of a rebuilt nation are very interesting and could have carried the movie without any need for marauding hun-like armies.  The Hoover dam, the complete lack of working automobiles, the talk of illnesses caused by the nuclear holocaust, more talk about promised lands on the other side of the mountains, perhaps even finally communicating with the rest of the rebuilt nation, would have made this a fine movie.  Instead we are left with an expensive remake of Mad Max, complete with cheap bad guys whom the author and director think unwashed movie-going masses need in every movie.  Apparently, this is because the hardship of the new world isn't enough of an antagonist, and movie-goers wouldn't be able to accept that as enough of a challenge.If you enjoy post-apocalyptic epic films, you will be sorely disappointed in this film's shallowness, lack of characterization, and unbelievable antagonist.

A wonderful cast combined with a well told story that is gripping. The characters are great, I love Micheal Madeson's portrayal of the psycho Mr. Blonde, and the music works very well. The opening of the movie, if you don't know what it's about, is just a bunch of men at a resturant talking. Then you get Mr. White driving a car covered in blood with a screaming Mr. Orange in trhe background. From this scene on I was totally captivated by it. Probably the best scene, to me, is the torture scene. Seeing it for the first time, watching Micheal doing his dance and just, enjoying what he was going to do, this plays very well with Stuck in the Middle With You. The only thing that I thought wasn't very good was the dialogue. Hearing the word F**k 3 times every second got to be a bit of a joke after a while.One of the most amasing things about this movie is that it was made on nothing. You can tell that it was a very, very low budget film, seeing as the entire movie basically takes place on one set. I heard that James Woods was supposed to play Mr. Orange, but don't think that he would have done as good a job because he looks old, in just about all of his movies (Mr. Orange is often refured to as a kid by Mr. White).Even though it is very coarse the dialogue is great, giving us fanatics quite a few monologues to learn.A perfect 10\/10.
