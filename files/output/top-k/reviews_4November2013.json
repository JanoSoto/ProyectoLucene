Heather (Heather Donahue) is the only girl of the group and really emerges as the leader as they try to get out of the woods. Mike (Michael Williams) is a character who becomes very creepy once the harmful effects in the woods prey on him. Josh (Joshua Leonard) is the quiet member of the group in this bad situation.

It's completely content at being what it is a bland entry into a franchise that, with the exception of one film, had descended into parody a long time before. The one thing this movie does try to do different with the franchise is that it uses more F bombs than all the other Halloween films put together (before Zombie, of course). This should be no surprise given Busta Rhymes is one of the stars. So yeah...that's something to be proud of.The cast is mostly terrible. Jamie Lee Curtis, clearly fed up with Halloween, reprises her iconic role for the sole purpose of seeing her killed off once and for all. You can't really blame her for wanting to be rid of this mess. The rest of the cast is made up of the super annoying Busta Rhymes, the beautiful Tyra Banks, and a host of (at that time) aspiring stars. Of the bunch I would say Bianca Kajlich and Katee Sackhoff comport themselves best. Obviously this movie did nothing to help the careers of anybody involved with it.Rick Rosenthal, who I felt did a decent job way back when with part 2, directs ineptly here. There isn't a memorable scene in the entire movie. It's just a loud, obnoxious mess of a slasher film. I struggle to decide whether this is the worst of the series or part 5 is. Both are excrement. There's also something truly sad about a Halloween movie being so unoriginal that it borrows from or rips off various other movies (Blair Witch Project, Scream, Terminator 2, Peeping Tom). The first Halloween movie was an innovator, not an imitator. It's just sad to see how far the franchise fell by 2002. I also think it was very indicative of the state of horror films at the time.

Though the current output of 3D movies far surpasses those of bygone eras, there have been two previous waves in cinema featuring the addition of a third dimension to draw audiences away from their television sets &#x96; first from the sets themselves, the second time from the choices offered by VCR technology these days it's a combination of high quality television production, the relatively large size of the home cinema screen and the ease in digital technology for users to watch whatever they fancy that threatens audience attendance &#x96; the previous one during the Eighties, the very first one in the Fifties. Then, like today, some high profile directors, fascinated by the narrative and visual possibilities offered by the three-dimensional aspect, tinkered with the technology to see what it could accomplish and add to the overall viewing experience. During the short lived fad of the Fifties, the most notable director to explore the new dimension was Alfred Hitchcock, who used it only once, for his 1954 crime thriller Dial M for Murder. Though its 3D release was almost as brief as the interest in 3D technology itself in that decade, it cannot be denied the 3D version of this classic film still makes for a fascinating watch, both with regards to the use of the third dimension and the story itself. Thanks to the EYE Filmmuseum in Amsterdam, I got the opportunity to experience this film as Hitchcock shot it, in a beautifully restored print that utilizes the modern 3D techniques, which also benefits the vividly rich Fifties' colour palette that would have been absent in the original 3D print with its notorious red & green glasses.It's clear upon watching the film Hitchcock made ample use of the added layers of depth 3D offered, as we get a clear sense of persons and objects in the foreground, the middle and the background of the frame, the depth perception shifting as another person or object moves into frame prominently on a closer layer. Considering most of this Kammerspiel type film takes place in a single room, 3D actually comes in quite handy to make the environment feel more alive and diverse than it otherwise would have felt. Especially notable is the scene where two characters are in mid-conversation and a vase enters the shot, basically right in our faces as we see the two men continue to talk behind it, though separated (both visually and in terms of their narrative interests) by the vase which is positioned in the middle of the shot composition. Of course, a few more typical in-your-face shots are also present, and these work far better than the ones we have grown used to, outstretched arms feeling almost tangible as they seem to hover right in front of us. Also charming to behold is the blue matte lines that appear around characters as they are in motion the modern 'high frame rate' technology might have been of benefit to avoid such visual oddities, but in this case it makes the movie feel even more historically intriguing from a technological viewpoint. Nevertheless, after the first hour it seems Hitchcock was running out of ideas as no particularly noteworthy new use of 3D is witnessed and the novelty of its sensations wears off. Until that point, this film makes some of the finest use of 3D to this day. The incomparable Grace Kelly never looked more beautiful than she does in all three dimensions in this remastered 3D print.In terms of story Dial M for Murder is simply a little outdated, through no fault of its own. The problem is it has been emulated, copied and parodied for almost sixty years. Though Hitchcock's famous mastery of suspense and the delivery and timing of his actors' dialogue is still of the highest order, it cannot help but make the movie feel like its dragging its feet just a little too long. The moment police inspector Hubbard (John Williams; not that one) enters the crime scene and displays just how brilliantly deductive the mind of a British inspector works as he spends the next 30 minutes explaining the details of the murder attempt for longer than we care to hear it (we got the point!), while occasionally touching his moustache in every conceivable clichéd manner, the movie drones on a little too much. Until that time though, the exciting plot offered by a man (Ray Milland) who means to murder his wife (Kelly) by blackmailing a former schoolmate who has fallen on hard times (Anthony Dawson), only to have the assassination gone horribly awry, makes for s striking crime drama of the highest order, good for many a scene of emotional tension like only Hitchcock managed to deliver. 1954 proved a good year for Hitchcock, as the celebrated director released the even more highly acclaimed (and superior) suspense thriller Rear Window &#x96; also starring Grace Kelly &#x96; only a few months later.

It is one of those great movies that was supposed to be a throwback to an old adventure for kids, but has become a vital part of our culture. I think the reason why it is better than the old Republic Pictures serials that it is inspired by is that it takes a modern approach, but is still timeless in how it was executed. And with the geniuses of Steven Spielberg and George Lucas behind the camera, this film reached an incredible level of excellence.The story is about an archaeologist named Indiana Jones, who has a flair for finding rather rare treasures with supernatural ties. On this particular adventure, he sets out to find the lost Ark of the Covenant. Along the way he joins with an old flame, Marion Ravenwood, who is angry with Indy for doing something to her in the past, but the two rekindle their old flame as the film goes. Indy also has to deal with the Nazis, who are trying to bring the Ark to Hitler for his own truly evil purposes. This thread seems as basic as the serials that they were based on, but the way the characters are set up and they way they play off of one another is brilliant. The writer for this movie is Lawrence Kasdan, who incorporated many of Steven and George's ideas, and forged them together into a very witty, exciting, and intriguing script. Each character is memorable and is never wasted, unless they are the secondary characters. Just like the old Republic films, there is breathless action and fast paced pacing, but here there is time for the characters to breathe and develop.Fresh off of Han Solo in Star Wars is Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones. Instead of being a brash smuggler like Solo was, here is a gruff rugged man who is sensitive and humane, but has just a glimmer of the character of Dobbs from The Treasure of Sierra Madre. Ford is just the natural fit for the character and makes him a fully realized action hero who is not brainless. And like any hero, he has a crippling flaw, a fear of snakes, which presents a great irony when he finally locates the Ark. And on the same level is Karen Allen as Marion. She is really tough and sassy, the perfect tomboy, but somehow presents an elegance that few women characters possess in this kind of genre. She can definitely hold her own in a fight, and gives Indy a perfect lady to fall for, and vice versa in Indy's case.The villains are pretty good in this film. They don't really act like Nazis very much as guys trying to make names for themselves and do their jobs for their fuhrer. Paul Freeman as Belloq is rather interesting. He is Indy's rival and somewhat equal, who will often times steal Indy's stuff and pass it off as his own discovery. He's the kind of guy who doesn't really like to get his clothes dirty. We have a man named Dietrich who is the senior Nazi officer, who serves only for Hitler and no one else. But then there is Toht, played by forgotten character actor Ronald Lacey. He is really creepy and menacing, but with a great side of humor, like Peter Lorre (which was Spielberg's intention) He is in all black wherever he goes and always wears a coat, which leads to one of the best gags in cinema.But the movie is very well known for the exciting action sequences. Lucas has a great notion of what should happen, but Spielberg is the true genius of these scenes. Spielberg is the kind of director who knows what he wants to see, which coincides with exactly what the audience wants as they view it. So when something exciting happens like when Indy jumps from a horse onto a moving truck, its done in such a way that it seems much more jaw dropping and stunning even though its perfectly logical in the grammar of an adventure movie.When Lucas and Spielberg decided to do this film, they would do it the old-fashioned way, quick, dirty, and relatively inexpensive. That's why the movie comes off as very fast-paced and imaginative. But one thing that reels the viewer's mind is that Lucas, the man who transformed special effects in Star Wars, would use cheap and old special effects. But again, they're done so convincingly that one hardly notices their imperfections, because they seem so logical and necessary. When the Ark is finally opened, it is mysterious and ultimately dooming for those who look upon the power of God, a fantastic display.The best known aspect of the film is John William's score, which is perfect.

I have not seen all of Carpenter's films, but from what I have seen, this is the one I enjoy the least. I do not think Christine is horrible, or even that bad, but I found it non-engaging. It is definitely not Stephen King's worst stories, but it is definitely not one of his best either.Christine stars Keith Gordon as Arnie Cunningham. He is a nerd who gets picked on and treated badly by everyone including his own parents. He has only one friend who is named Dennis, played by Jason Stockwell. He comes across an old beat-up car called Christine being sold by this old man. Despite being trashed and Dennis telling him not to he buys the car anyway and takes it to a shop to get it fixed. Little does Arnie know that Christine has a mind of her own and even kills people that are mean to Arnie. Slowly but surely Christine starts taking starts taking Arnie over to the point where he only care about Christine.The film does have some things going in its favor. The effects are decent. I like all the scenes with Christine, whether it'd killing people manipulating Arnie, or the scene where she puts herself back together, which is the best effect of the whole film. The premise of a killer car is a bit silly, but I thought it was fine as a b-movie idea, and I have seen far stranger ideas from Stephen King. . I also like that they kept why Christine is alive a mystery. There is an explanation in the book, but it is very underwhelming and cliché for horror films. Keeping Christine a mystery I think was the right way to go.However, there are many problems with the film. The first and biggest problem is that I do not like anybody including the main character, Arnie. Besides being a strait horror movie, this film is supposed to be a tragedy where this innocent kid gets possessed by this evil car and cannot live without it. The problem is that even before he gets the car I never cared for him. He seemed to be kind of an asshole himself. I know he has had a hard life, but all he does is complain about how bad his life is, which makes him look whiny. He hardly cares about his friend Dennis either, even before he gets Christine, despite trying to be a good friend.Dennis is a nice guy, but beyond that he is very bland and boring. Not to mention, the actor Jason Stockwell is a pretty bad at acting. I have not seen Jason in other films, but his performance is very wooden here. That is another problem with the film. Other than Arnie, nobody in the cast can act. The lead girl I do not care for either. I thought she was boring as well, and the actress is not that great at acting either. The other characters are not worth mentioning.Overall, Christine is an okay b-movie to watch as a time waster. I found it to be one of by lesser favorite Stephen King stories and definitely my least favorite Carpenter film. I like the kill scenes involving Christine, as well as the effects. However, there is not much else to this.

Not because this is the definitive effort, but just for the simple reason that this has nothing to do with any of them. It's a family-friendly version, with a lot of rather unnecessary CGI throughout, and far more gags than genuine shocks. It's your standard action\/adventure movie, and yet, it still is reasonably entertaining. But the biggest disappointment of all, is the fact that there isn't really a mummy in the entire movie. Instead, in a plot exactly lifted from Clive Barker's original Hellraiser movie, we have a decomposing, cursed man who must drain his victims dry, to rebuild himself physically. Not exactly original.What does make rather a nice change, though, is the fact that both our leads are capable and seem to be having a lot of fun, rather than the po-faced posing we're so used to seeing in movies these days. Brendan Fraser is a capable and solid enough hero, who, despite his constant dry quips, is not at all arrogant, and has a quiet believability to him totally unlike your average action hero. Rachel Weisz, back before the dark days of Constantine, is charming and talented, and there is a great chemistry between the two of them that keeps the movie alive. The vast swathe of other characters, largely comic grotesques, range form John Hannah's likable buffoon, to Kevin J O'Connors' weaselly little git. Connor manages to get even more and more annoying in each scene, and whilst he isn't the only thing wrong with this movie, cutting him out entirely would improve this movie no end.Arnold Vosloo is a fairly by-numbers villain, who adds little beyond a certain imposing physicality to the role, although he does look good in the role. His love interest, though, Patricia Velasquez, is phenomenal, and if ever there was a woman worth suffering a living death for, it must just be her. Velasquez has less than five minutes screen-time, but makes her presence acutely felt, with her elaborate, painted on costume, the most visually stunning element of the entire movie.The story putters along, with some impressively staged action scenes, with great stunt-work throughout. It's just a shame that the horror content wasn't half as good as the stunt-work, because then we'd have a proper Mummy film. Instead, rather than being at all creepy, all the supernatural elements are handled with heavy CG. Vast biblical plagues are realised effectively enough, but the over-the-top nature of most of the CG threats - plagues of millions of beetles you can escape by side-stepping, plagues of locusts you can avoid by staying indoors, huge walls of sand, etc - aren't written compotently enough to be exciting. The main problem is the old chestnut of the all-powerful villain, who somehow gets defeated. They've amped up Imhotep's powers so much, that he's a supernatural entity who can do anything with a thought - so how does he get so easily defeated? Lesson learned here - don't give your villain unlimited powers, or else we'll just be massively disappointed when he finally gets beaten, and this movie is no exception.There is a strong comedy quotient in this movie, where tension is never allowed to be built up, without immediately being diffused by a joke, or someone making light of the situation. It creates the jaunty, entertaining tone, but, unlike most movies, it doesn't go away as the stakes get higher. Our characters make jokes, and are engaged in comic set-pieces right up until the very end. The more fun tone is fine to begin with, but it gets a bit tiresome towards the end, when things should be getting a lot more serious.Dramatically, The Mummy is heavily flawed. The CGI is far too over-used, the threat amped up to totally unrealistic proportions, which only succeed in being faintly disappointing. But, Fraser and Weisz are good leads. Jerry Goldsmith delivers a very traditionalist soundtrack, which largely goes un-noticed in the chaos. The first half is fun, reasonably exciting, heavily action-packed, and funny without being silly. Sadly, the end gets rather flat, and the build-up we've had, where we're waiting to finally see the mummy, is rudely shattered by a rather shoddy piece of CGI.To be honest, it could have been a lot worse. It's very casually entertaining, made for audiences with a short-attention span, who laugh at gag after gag because they don't have the patience to follow a plot, or sustain an atmosphere. It's rubbish compared to the Hammer movie, but, compared to today's blockbusters, there's something charmingly human about it all.

His love interest, though, Patricia Velasquez, is phenomenal, and if ever there was a woman worth suffering a living death for, it must just be her. Velasquez has less than five minutes screen-time, but makes her presence acutely felt, with her elaborate, painted on costume, the most visually stunning element of the entire movie.The story putters along, with some impressively staged action scenes, with great stunt-work throughout. It's just a shame that the horror content wasn't half as good as the stunt-work, because then we'd have a proper Mummy film. Instead, rather than being at all creepy, all the supernatural elements are handled with heavy CG. Vast biblical plagues are realised effectively enough, but the over-the-top nature of most of the CG threats - plagues of millions of beetles you can escape by side-stepping, plagues of locusts you can avoid by staying indoors, huge walls of sand, etc - aren't written compotently enough to be exciting. The main problem is the old chestnut of the all-powerful villain, who somehow gets defeated. They've amped up Imhotep's powers so much, that he's a supernatural entity who can do anything with a thought - so how does he get so easily defeated? Lesson learned here - don't give your villain unlimited powers, or else we'll just be massively disappointed when he finally gets beaten, and this movie is no exception.There is a strong comedy quotient in this movie, where tension is never allowed to be built up, without immediately being diffused by a joke, or someone making light of the situation. It creates the jaunty, entertaining tone, but, unlike most movies, it doesn't go away as the stakes get higher. Our characters make jokes, and are engaged in comic set-pieces right up until the very end. The more fun tone is fine to begin with, but it gets a bit tiresome towards the end, when things should be getting a lot more serious.Dramatically, The Mummy is heavily flawed. The CGI is far too over-used, the threat amped up to totally unrealistic proportions, which only succeed in being faintly disappointing. But, Fraser and Weisz are good leads. Jerry Goldsmith delivers a very traditionalist soundtrack, which largely goes un-noticed in the chaos. The first half is fun, reasonably exciting, heavily action-packed, and funny without being silly. Sadly, the end gets rather flat, and the build-up we've had, where we're waiting to finally see the mummy, is rudely shattered by a rather shoddy piece of CGI.To be honest, it could have been a lot worse. It's very casually entertaining, made for audiences with a short-attention span, who laugh at gag after gag because they don't have the patience to follow a plot, or sustain an atmosphere. It's rubbish compared to the Hammer movie, but, compared to today's blockbusters, there's something charmingly human about it all.

Not because this is the definitive effort, but just for the simple reason that this has nothing to do with any of them. It's a family-friendly version, with a lot of rather unnecessary CGI throughout, and far more gags than genuine shocks. It's your standard action\/adventure movie, and yet, it still is reasonably entertaining. But the biggest disappointment of all, is the fact that there isn't really a mummy in the entire movie. Instead, in a plot exactly lifted from Clive Barker's original Hellraiser movie, we have a decomposing, cursed man who must drain his victims dry, to rebuild himself physically. Not exactly original.What does make rather a nice change, though, is the fact that both our leads are capable and seem to be having a lot of fun, rather than the po-faced posing we're so used to seeing in movies these days. Brendan Fraser is a capable and solid enough hero, who, despite his constant dry quips, is not at all arrogant, and has a quiet believability to him totally unlike your average action hero. Rachel Weisz, back before the dark days of Constantine, is charming and talented, and there is a great chemistry between the two of them that keeps the movie alive. The vast swathe of other characters, largely comic grotesques, range form John Hannah's likable buffoon, to Kevin J O'Connors' weaselly little git.

It is a film based on the very popular novel by William Shakespeare. The story is set in the Italian city of Padua and is about a father who wants to wed off his older, vicious, wild daughter before anyone can marry his younger, sweeter and prettier daughter. It is quite a humorous film and I think Zeffirelli picked the cast very well and they suited their characters. Elizabeth Taylor who plays Katharina plays her character very well; at the start of the film she is a loud, scary, violent person who acts crazy. She fights with her sister and father constantly and refuses to get married, she has wild black hair and very colourful clothes and she is very strong, independent character. However at the end of the film she is completely different after being tamed. She is quiet and respectful to her husband. She agrees to whatever he has to say and does what he tells her to do. Her hair is pulled back off her face and neat. Bianca, Katharina's sister is played by Natasha Pyne is a completely different character to Katharina. She is quiet and polite. Bianca is smaller, prettier and sweeter than Katharina. You can really tell the difference in the two of them in the film even by what they are wearing. Bianca wears pale, pretty dresses and has her hair always done nicely, whereas Katharina wears colourful crazy dresses and her hair is always messy until she met Petruchio. The costumes in The Taming of The Shrew are very colourful and old fashioned. They wear long, puffy, colourful dresses like what they wore in the 1600's. The men then wore massive woolly jackets and tight trousers. Both men and woman also wore big head pieces. Men wore hats and sometimes a few feathers on it and woman wore very expensive looking head pieces especially to occasions like weddings which we see a lot of in The Taming of The Shrew. The setting of the film is also old style; they live in massive old castles. In the scene when Petruchio chases Katharina we see a lot of the house and the barn or storage area, there was onions hanging all around it from the ceiling, big blocks of cheese and a massive area for storing sheep's wool which shows how well off Katharina's family were to have so much sheep wool which would have been very expensive back then. I think The Taming of The Shrew is quiet a humorous film. There are some funny parts throughout it like when Petruchio is at Katharina's house ringing the door bell and Katharina gets so frustrated that she pulls the doorbell off and breaks it and slams the door in Petruchio's face. This scene shows how angry Katharina is and how violent she is but is also witty. Another funny scene is at the very end when Petruchio sends his servant to command Katharina to come into him. As the servant is walking out the door he blesses himself because he thinks Katharina is going to attack him for telling her what to do and feels like he won't make it out alive. I think one of the main scenes in The Taming of The Shrew is when Petruchio and Katharine are heading back to Padua to Katharine's father and Petruchio tells her that the sun is the moon and she agrees with him he then says that it is the sun and she agrees with him again. She is completely controlled by Petruchio and is now tamed. She would never disobey him like she would before they got married, she is completely different person. Another major scene in this film where it shows Katharine completely different is at the very end when each man calls in their wives to the ball room, none of their wives would come out to them apart from Katharine. Who was the last person everyone thought would come out. This also shows how much Petruchio controls her. I really liked this film. I thought it was really interesting and funny at parts. Franco Zeffierlli also directed the 1968 version of Romeo and Juliet and I much prefer his version of The Taming of The Shrew. I think I might like it better because I feel there are so many different versions of Romeo and Juliet and I've studied it so many times whereas this was my first time studying The Taming of the Shrew so it was all new to me.

But it's not flat-footed slow because the viewer is pulled along by the unfolding of events and characters. The movie pays off, especially at the end, so stick with it.Perhaps modern movies are too fast. It's nice to watch a slow movie for a change, after so many hyper-paced movies. Like many old noir movies, there is lots of atmosphere, a sense of place and time, that is more interesting today, as that era fades from memory. The slow pace gives you time to savor it, and to observe the interactions. Gradually, we get a sense of the true character of the leads as they are tested by circumstance. The results are not entirely predictable, right up to the end. The plot is fairly intricate, and integral with the characters, something we don't see enough of these days. While I wouldn't say there are any holes in the plot, there are one or two premises that seem a bit off, the biggest that the DA would be allowed to try a case he was a witness to. But perhaps rules were looser back then.Speaking of the DA, this is Kirk Douglas' first film role, and he knocks it out of the park. Every performance is impeccable, including the secondary actors, Lizabeth Scott and Darryl Hickman. One of the characteristics of noir films is moral ambiguity. Here, it is difficult to figure out who the good guys and bad guys are, at least until the end. Their true characters unfold slowly.This is a director's movie much of the credit should go to director Lewis Milestone for making everything just right. This is also a film connoisseur's movie, an undiscovered gem for someone who has seen everything. Why it is so unknown is a puzzle. Perhaps it was the timing, just after the end of WWII, and being an especially dark noir, unlike, say, The Maltese Falcon, which was leavened by a surprising amount of wry humor. But I think the biggest reason is that it simply isn't a movie most people will want to watch several times partly because it is too dark, and also because it is so dependent on the ending.

The film is very obvious in its emotions and obnoxiously sunny in its disposition and tone (don't consider these flaws or criticisms), but it's also a picture to laud for the professionalism of its cast and the inanely addicting melodies of its song and dance numbers.The film concerns Don Lockwood (Gene Kelly), a popular and egotistical silent film star who is now feeling the switch from silent film to talkies, films that have actual sound. Lockword often works with his cheery and humorous friend Cosmo Brown (Donald O'Connor) as well as the shallow and often incorrigible Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen) in his films. After the success of 1927's The Jazz Singer (the first film with sound), Lockwood and Lamont's next picture, titled The Dueling Cavalier, is now a talkie but will need to overcome challenges. The most prominent challenge is Lamont's high-pitched, nearly-insufferable singing voice. Meanwhile, Lockwood meets Kathy Selden (Debbie Reynolds), an attractive and ambitious young actress. At first, they find each other to be irritating in their own ways. But Lockwood must learn to work with Kathy, once the crew discovers her presence may be necessary for the success of the project.Such song and dance numbers from Singin' in the Rain need to be experienced and can't be done justice in a conversation or an analysis. If you've seen the film, would you rather discuss the hilarity of Cosmo's Make 'Em Laugh number, involving the character zealously prancing around a stage, doing flips and crazy dances while singing perfectly on key, or view it for the umpteenth time? Would you rather analyze Don Lockwood's titular song and dance (while battling a high-fever and a bad cold), or would you rather see it again and maybe wonder how Kelly performed so well when he was so ill? Musicals are a challenge to review because no matter what words you use to describe it or how you about analyzing the picture and its musical numbers, you simply don't feel like you're doing justice to its quality. I often laud musicals very heavily on atmosphere, sets, and acting, and all of those features are unsurprisingly top-notch here. The element likely to be neglected here is the acting, as Singin' in the Rain feature many talented people performing in a way few could. Such performers needed to be of a certain quality and such actors needed to be up to the challenge of performing a dance with such militaristic precision and rigor.To me, that's why Singin' in the Rain is the masterpiece that it is. The sets can only hurt your eyes with color for so long. The songs can only be fun to hum and sing for so long (I confess - I've been singing Moses Supposes for two weeks straight now and feel it ranks as one of the best songs ever in any musical that I have yet to see for its difficulty in pitch and tongue-twisting lyrics). What Singin' in the Rain has that secures its long term success is its outstanding cast of performers that, from the start, are committed to delivering material with such memorable, complex force. Never have I seen a musical so assisted and made successful based solely on the talent of its actors.Starring Gene Kelly, Debbie Reynolds, Jean Hagen, and Donald O'Connor.

","genre":"Comedy, Musical, Romance"},{"date":"4 November 2013","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" I have a nudging feeling that Singin' in the Rain has gotten the reputation of being overly-corny and shamelessly frothy with age and those accusations have unfortunately lessened the impact of the picture. The film is very obvious in its emotions and obnoxiously sunny in its disposition and tone (don't consider these flaws or criticisms), but it's also a picture to laud for the professionalism of its cast and the inanely addicting melodies of its song and dance numbers.The film concerns Don Lockwood (Gene Kelly), a popular and egotistical silent film star who is now feeling the switch from silent film to talkies, films that have actual sound. Lockword often works with his cheery and humorous friend Cosmo Brown (Donald O'Connor) as well as the shallow and often incorrigible Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen) in his films. After the success of 1927's The Jazz Singer (the first film with sound), Lockwood and Lamont's next picture, titled The Dueling Cavalier, is now a talkie but will need to overcome challenges. The most prominent challenge is Lamont's high-pitched, nearly-insufferable singing voice. Meanwhile, Lockwood meets Kathy Selden (Debbie Reynolds), an attractive and ambitious young actress. At first, they find each other to be irritating in their own ways. But Lockwood must learn to work with Kathy, once the crew discovers her presence may be necessary for the success of the project.Such song and dance numbers from Singin' in the Rain need to be experienced and can't be done justice in a conversation or an analysis. If you've seen the film, would you rather discuss the hilarity of Cosmo's Make 'Em Laugh number, involving the character zealously prancing around a stage, doing flips and crazy dances while singing perfectly on key, or view it for the umpteenth time? Would you rather analyze Don Lockwood's titular song and dance (while battling a high-fever and a bad cold), or would you rather see it again and maybe wonder how Kelly performed so well when he was so ill? Musicals are a challenge to review because no matter what words you use to describe it or how you about analyzing the picture and its musical numbers, you simply don't feel like you're doing justice to its quality. I often laud musicals very heavily on atmosphere, sets, and acting, and all of those features are unsurprisingly top-notch here. The element likely to be neglected here is the acting, as Singin' in the Rain feature many talented people performing in a way few could. Such performers needed to be of a certain quality and such actors needed to be up to the challenge of performing a dance with such militaristic precision and rigor.To me, that's why Singin' in the Rain is the masterpiece that it is. The sets can only hurt your eyes with color for so long. The songs can only be fun to hum and sing for so long (I confess - I've been singing Moses Supposes for two weeks straight now and feel it ranks as one of the best songs ever in any musical that I have yet to see for its difficulty in pitch and tongue-twisting lyrics). What Singin' in the Rain has that secures its long term success is its outstanding cast of performers that, from the start, are committed to delivering material with such memorable, complex force. Never have I seen a musical so assisted and made successful based solely on the talent of its actors.Starring Gene Kelly, Debbie Reynolds, Jean Hagen, and Donald O'Connor.

Spoilers ahead!This film is but one of a series made in the early 1980s that dealt with issues of social change and individuals dealing with overwhelming odds against powerful oppressors. Among earlier epics like Reds and Gandhi, Silkwood is perhaps the most relatable to the average individual, and thus perhaps the most poignant. Unlike the protagonist of Reds, Karen Silkwood is not an upper-class do-gooder out to change the whole world from the outset; she is an ordinary laborer in a nuclear materials plant who becomes a social crusader due to the hazards of her workplace on both herself and her coworkers. Also, unlike Gandhi, Silkwood is subdued and limited in scope, the setting being limited to rural Oklahoma and the nuclear materials plant; the characters are not nation-builders or viceroys, but workers, union leaders, managers and reporters. Mike Nichols's film about Karen Silkwood, while being comparatively humble, is no less heartbreaking and gripping.Meryl Streep is excellent as the eponymous protagonist. Unlike John Reed in Reds, Karen Silkwood is of the same class and temperament as the people she is trying to save. She playfully steals coworkers' food in the cafeteria, laughs at their crude jokes, and chides her roommates--also employees at the company--for keeping spoiled food in the refrigerator. Because Silkwood is close to the people she works and lives with, she is particularly distraught when she learns about the plant's contamination and watches as a coworker is given a brutal bath to rid her of irradiation. She understands them as John Reed never could. Some critics have characterized the character of Silkwood as equally obnoxious and irrational as she is noble. Silkwood is a back-slapping blue-collar woman like everyone else in her life, but Streep is able to make these traits endearing rather than annoying. It is Silkwood's personality which makes her hated by coworkers and company later in the film, even though members of the audience get the sense that *anyone else in the plant* could have ended up like Silkwood if they had chosen her path. The audience feels, for the most part, sympathy with the tribulations of Silkwood rather than distance, and this is to Streep's credit. It seems fair to fault the movie for getting sidetracked in the first hour or so with stories about Silkwood's relationship with her boyfriend and roommates, as well as her painful relationship with her divorced common-law husband and her children. While, on the surface, having little to do with the main plot about Silkwood's fight against nuclear plant corruption, these vignettes are nevertheless important in building and developing Silkwood's character, such that she is fully three-dimensional and sympathetic when the main plot starts rolling. Unfortunately, these early scenes may be distracting to the first-time viewer, so much so that they may lose sight of what the movie is about, and might turn off the TV (or monitor) in frustration because the first third is boring and doesn't seem to go anywhere plot-wise. A fair warning Silkwood is as much about the emotional interactions between three roommates in a small house as it is about workplace safety; these plot points *do* eventually join together, but it requires patience on the part of the audience.While Meryl Streep portrays Silkwood as a gutsy, fearless individual, the movie treads carefully between hagiography and castigation. The movie does not ignore the toll SIlkwood's fight against the company has on her roommates and, more significantly, her coworkers, who show understandable concern that her sleuthing will only result in the company shutting down and everyone getting laid off. While those around her change in their attitudes toward Silkwood, Silkwood, remarkably, remains a static character, as boisterous and playful near the end as she was in the beginning (a near-finale scene with her boyfriend as she departs for the last time shows this character development). Silkwood is a fine piece of filmmaking about a true working-class hero. Meryl Streep deserves credit for making Karen Silkwood a likable and compelling protagonist, who in lesser hands may have come off as annoying. While unsung today, Silkwood remains one of the best of the social cause movies of the 1980s. Highly recommended. ","genre":null},{"date":"4 November 2013","score":"","review":" Warning!

Singing cowboys wearing clean designer outfits were the norm in the 1930s-50s and while Roy Rogers and Gene Autry films were enjoyable, they were pure fiction.

When it's not borrowing from other films (Bride of Frankenstein, The Eyes of Laura Mars), it's outright ripping them off (Friday the 13th Part 2). There's not a suspenseful or scary moment in the whole movie. Every new character is unlikeable. One of the somewhat likable characters from part 4 is killed off early and needlessly. Danielle Harris improves from the last film but spends a significant portion of the movie unable to speak. So take that for what it's worth. Donald Pleasence, the saving grace of most of these films, is here reduced to full-blown caricature. Still he tries to elevate the material by treating it seriously. Points for trying but it's a lost cause. Oh and the two bumbling comic relief cops what were they thinking with that? There's even goofy sound effects the first time they show up. Moronic.Another annoying thing are the constant red herring jumps.

The novel follows the life of a Igbo tribesman and his kin as they adjust to the arrival of Christian missionaries and struggle with the impact of British colonial rule. It's a great book that illustrates Western cultures' largely grim history towards less civilized societies. Better still, Things Fall Apart is not liberal white guilt shrouded in anthropological verses; it's a book that attempts to accurately portray things as they were and as they eventually became. The main character Okonkwo isn't a mindless barbarian nor a noble tribesman but somewhere in-between. Hubert, Vinz and Said, the main characters of La Haine (1995) (roughly translates from French to Hate), are much like Okonkwo. They are not quite saints or sinners, just a gang of French kids with little to do but sit around and watch the world throw insult and injury at their banlieue.But let us start at the beginning; 1038am. Said (Said Taghmaoui) a young man of Middle Eastern descent is standing outside of Vinz's (Vincent Cassel) house waiting for him to wake up. He calls out his name creating a ruckus Vinz's neighbors don't take too kindly to. As Vinz goes about his business getting ready there is a menorah behind him. They meet up with Hubert (Hubert Kounde) a young black man just trying to keep his nose clean especially since the last riot in the banlieue left many public buildings ransacked and his friends may have been involved. To top it all off, one of their friends Abdel was put into a coma while in police custody and Vinz vows to get revenge anyway he can.The precipitating macguffin is a lost police firearm that the trio get ahold of. Vinz would like to use it to kill a cop if Abdel dies and holsters it like a gangster wannabe. Through the gun, the audience travels with the young multi-ethnic men through nineteen hours in the life. The voice-over forebodingly divulges a tale; Heard about the guy who fell off a skyscraper? On his way down past each floor, he kept saying to reassure himself So far so good... so far so good... so far so good. How you fall doesn't matter. It's how you land! Throughout the day the three have constant run-ins with police; some trying to keep the boys out of trouble, some just doing their jobs, and some abusing their power. It's easy to see how things will land.But to summarize La Haine as a story about men making bad decisions and getting punished for it would be selling the filmmakers short. The movie expands to explore the nature of violence and how it can inhabit minds. Furthermore it explores how poverty, and racism can coax violence from people. The characters are all minorities living in a country that is passively and symbolically racist towards them. They feed off of the violence depicted in popular entertainment and are incensed by the police brutality around them. Yet they have nowhere to release their frustrations. Hate breeds hate, the sensible Hubert explains as Vinz pumps himself up for possible homicide. It's important to note that much like the Projects of Chicago or New York, the banlieues of Paris are apportioned largely by differences in income distribution and extreme racial segregation. While Said and Vinz would under other circumstances be religiously in conflict, because of their minority status, they interact with the world at large in tandem.Like Things Fall Apart, La Haine follows the same tragic hero outline that certainly doesn't end with rays of sunshine. Still the raw acting talent exhibited by the cast, the stylish bare-bones directing by Matthieu Kassovitz and, above all biting social commentary, makes this film a must watch.

Released in 1938, The Lady Vanishes stars May Witty as Miss Froy, a British woman who vanishes whilst on a train journey across Europe. Attempting to locate Miss Froy are Iris (Margaret Lockwood) and Gilbert (Michael Redgrave), a couple of unwitting adventurers. She's your typical Hitchcockian leading lady, headstrong and opinionated, he's a dashing musician, complete with that pencil-thin moustache so favoured by dapper British heroes. Both believe Froy to have been kidnapped.Hitchcock's films often find their heroes trapped in mischievous conspiracies. Here our heroine, like the lead in Hitchcock's North by Northwest, is accused of being absolutely insane. She, everyone insists, imagined a kidnapping where none took place. But Iris remains undaunted. She proceeds to search her train, determined to get to the heart of what turns out to be an ingenious shell-game.Whilst The Lady Vanishes doesn't ascribe a nationality to its villains, it nevertheless serves as one of Hitchcock's early propaganda pieces. Most of the film finds various British characters unconcerned about Miss Froy's absence. It is only when Froy is revealed to be a British secret agent, and when a certain European country is revealed to be sinister and violent, that our cast of Brits spring into action (they assemble in a carriage and take up arms against the enemy). In this way, the film becomes a covert attack on British obstinacy in the face of Nazi aggression. Why jump a fence when you can sit on it?! one character quips, a form of passive diplomacy which the film denounces. Epitomising these attitudes are Charters and Caldicott (played by comedian duo Basil Radford and Naunton Wayne), a couple of chronically unimpressed Englishmen who'd let people vanish if it meant arriving at a cricket game on time. Because of such petty obsessions and snobbish self-regard, the film argues, kindly heroes like Miss Froy are left to die! Like most Hitchcock films, Vanishes is brisk, kinky (copious shots of women in their undergarments), gives complex (for the time) leading roles to women and carefully mixes thrills with humour. We also see Hitchcock's unique approach to filming space; he creates models to facilitate sweeping shots, his camera work is almost always audacious and he seems exhilarated by the challenge of shooting a film almost entirely within a train's cramped carriages.Politically, the film is a bit less impressive, its last half hour resorting to emotional blackmail (a cute, elderly spy!), British xenophobia and simplistic attitudes toward history and politics; the European fascists (particularly Hitler and Mussolini) weren't Britain's enemy in the lead up to WW2, but her chief allies against workers movements which sought the toppling of European aristocracy. It's a truism found throughout history the enemy of your enemy is your friend, and when he gets too big for his boots, take him out yourself. The result is a film supposedly about British insularity and classism, that is itself insular and classist. Whilst typically viewed as being apolitical, Hitchcock actually made several propaganda pictures (Foreign Correspondent, Adventure Malgache, F3080, Bon Voyage, Sabotage, Topaz, Lifeboat, Torn Curtain etc). Before all these was 1935's The 39 Steps, an ahead-of-its time espionage thriller.Like most Hitchcock films, Steps revolves around a man wrongly accused of a crime. He's Richard Hannay, a Canadian tourist who finds himself in the strange world of Britain, and the stranger world of pre-War espionage. Unfolding like a noirish nightmare, much of the film consists of Hannay evading the police, lurking in shadows and attempting to solve a mystery involving the theft of stolen military secrets. Interestingly, the film reverses several aspects of The Lady Vanishes; where that film involved spies and secrets returning to Britian, Steps involves the smuggling of stolen secrets out of Britain. Both films also have their secrets stored in music, one stored within a Music Hall performer, the other embedded within a song.The 39 Steps has been overshadowed by North by Northwest, but in many ways its the better film. It's tighter, darker, and would set in stone many subsequent genre conventions. Like Vanishing, Hitchcock also mixes thrills with screwball comedy, throws in yet more shots of women in their lingerie (Hitch's camera practically salivates as women remove their stockings), and climaxes with a bickering duo becoming a romantic couple. Its last shots then echo that of The Lady Vanishes, hands clasping as nightmares end.8.9\/10 &#x96; Charming and brisk, both films are early Hitchcock masterpieces, though both are also perhaps too British for international audiences.

Like most Hitchcock films, Vanishes is brisk, kinky (copious shots of women in their undergarments), gives complex (for the time) leading roles to women and carefully mixes thrills with humour. We also see Hitchcock's unique approach to filming space; he creates models to facilitate sweeping shots, his camera work is almost always audacious and he seems exhilarated by the challenge of shooting a film almost entirely within a train's cramped carriages.Politically, the film is a bit less impressive, its last half hour resorting to emotional blackmail (a cute, elderly spy!), British xenophobia and simplistic attitudes toward history and politics; the European fascists (particularly Hitler and Mussolini) weren't Britain's enemy in the lead up to WW2, but her chief allies against workers movements which sought the toppling of European aristocracy. It's a truism found throughout history the enemy of your enemy is your friend, and when he gets too big for his boots, take him out yourself. The result is a film supposedly about British insularity and classism, that is itself insular and classist. Whilst typically viewed as being apolitical, Hitchcock actually made several propaganda pictures (Foreign Correspondent, Adventure Malgache, F3080, Bon Voyage, Sabotage, Topaz, Lifeboat, Torn Curtain etc). Before all these was 1935's The 39 Steps, an ahead-of-its time espionage thriller.Like most Hitchcock films, Steps revolves around a man wrongly accused of a crime. He's Richard Hannay, a Canadian tourist who finds himself in the strange world of Britain, and the stranger world of pre-War espionage. Unfolding like a noirish nightmare, much of the film consists of Hannay evading the police, lurking in shadows and attempting to solve a mystery involving the theft of stolen military secrets. Interestingly, the film reverses several aspects of The Lady Vanishes; where that film involved spies and secrets returning to Britian, Steps involves the smuggling of stolen secrets out of Britain. Both films also have their secrets stored in music, one stored within a Music Hall performer, the other embedded within a song.The 39 Steps has been overshadowed by North by Northwest, but in many ways its the better film. It's tighter, darker, and would set in stone many subsequent genre conventions. Like Vanishing, Hitchcock also mixes thrills with screwball comedy, throws in yet more shots of women in their lingerie (Hitch's camera practically salivates as women remove their stockings), and climaxes with a bickering duo becoming a romantic couple. Its last shots then echo that of The Lady Vanishes, hands clasping as nightmares end.8.9\/10 &#x96; Charming and brisk, both films are early Hitchcock masterpieces, though both are also perhaps too British for international audiences. ","genre":"Mystery, Thriller"},{"date":"4 November 2013","score":"","review":" This is Disney's 33rd full length-animated feature film, a story about Capt. John Smith and a group of English sailors trying to find gold and riches in a Virginia territory, which is inhabited by native Pocahontas and her tribe. The plot goes on as a tug-a-war between the settlers and the natives, with the former trying to claim new territory and the latter trying to reason with them settlers to leave them alone as they are not the savages they claim they are.This movie is another piece of beautiful animation work, with wonderful songs such as Colors of the Wind and Just Around the Riverbend. The story, however, wasn't very captivating and it was told in a way that is too dramatic and dreary for Disney (i.e., too much preaching between the tribe and the settlers about each other's own rights and privileges; people getting shot; unhappy climax). This film definitely doesn't have that special Disney touch. In addition, from what I understand, this film doesn't follow the true history of Pocahontas and John Smith, which gives the wrong message to viewers.Overall, a less happier and exciting Disney movie that I wouldn't mind not watching again. There are much better Disney films out there from the 1990s than this one.
