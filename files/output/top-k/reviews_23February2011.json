Se7en, like all of Hitchcock's best films, and like the fore-mentioned SotL, builds tension through suggestion and atmosphere. There is very little actual violence or gore in the film, but what is SUGGESTED is horrifying. The cinematography is superb the film almost physically feels dirty and grimy. Darkness pervades all, and by the end of the film I had the doors all locked and felt a curious urge to bathe myself, to scrub off the filthiness and evil that is omni-prevalent in the film. It knows the creepiness of silence and emptiness, and the scariest portions of the film are usually also the most uneventful. The score is good and matches the visuals nicely. The acting is almost perfect the background roles all do their job well, Morgan Freeman is convincing as a seasoned and cynical investigator, and Keven Spacey is brilliant as the unhinged, moralizing serial killer. Brad Pitt, however, is an awful actor, and he is the one thing I found really wrong with this film. Actually, most of the movie he was adequate but irritating I just accepted that the character is supposed to be cocky and irritating as well and moved on. But the ending... let's just say Brad Pitt almost ruins what is one of the most shocking endings in cinematic history with his inability to act. Otherwise, the film is nearly perfect, but because Pitt's acting broke my immersion in the film during the climax, I can only award it eight out of ten stars. Hopefully people will learn to keep him far away from roles that require any actual acting.

Eraserhead has been one of those films. However, after reading about how disturbing the movie is, and how many movies magazines and critics have labeled it among the most bizarre and even dangerous films ever made, I have always been very reluctant to see it.I have seen other weird films that I have been intensely curious about, but after seeing them, I could not sleep afterwords. Having refused to see Eraserhead unless it was with other people, not by myself, I finally saw the movie the way it was meant to be seen at a special midnight showing in the Coolidge Corner Theater, located in Brookline, Massachusetts.After seeing it, I fortunately don't have nightmares, but I still can't stop thinking about the film. It is almost always bizarre, sometimes grotesque, and a bit startling at times. What's amazing is how it doesn't feel dated, despite being 35 years old. It's shot in a cool black and white, which gives it a noir feel that has never run out of date. There are also very few (almost no) 20th century technological devices in it, making the film as relevant to 2011 as it was to 1976. It's also amazing that newer generations of moviegoers (like myself) are still drawn to it despite how weird it is.And yes, make no mistake about it, Eraserhead is very, very, very weird, and oftentimes incredibly intense. However, film lovers still see method in director David Lynch's madness, even though they may not completely understand it.Another part of this film's appeal is how the incoherent story structure is used towards this movie's advantage. Without one of the 14 standard Hollywood plots, the film takes hold of your desire to see what happens next. Every drawn out moment of silence clutches onto your attention span, and every eccentric character shocks you, but dares you to look away.It goes without saying that the question everyone has probably asked themselves at least once while seeing this film is, Why? Why does the lead character wear his hair straight up like he's been electrocuted? Why did he and his girlfriend try to raise a deformed baby in a cramped apartment? Why does this man see a singing woman in his radiator? Why does this woman have such huge, deformed cheeks? Why does she sing In Heaven, Everything Is Fine?People who hate this film (and I imagine there are more than a few) have asked themselves variations of this basic question, but refuse to answer them. Fans of the film probably have different answers to this question every time they attempt to answer it. David Lynch's answer is probably, Why not?, which definitely keeps film fans coming back.

Did the perfectionist director ever hear of the deferential gear that would make this impossible or was that Mercedes a 4x4? 2) What exactly put the bad guys on the same train as the lead? Do they have a crystal ball or does our perfectionist director use out of earth B-Movie quality coincidences to spice things up? 3) I nearly laughed during that scene where the plane hit the tanker. Not because the plane in the wide shot was in a location and angle that would make it impossible to hit the tanker, but because during the explosion we can see for a full two seconds the puppets in the place of the tanker's driver and his passenger sitting still while the tanker goes in fire.4) In the restaurant shooting scene, the kid in the background covers his ears before the shot, even though he was not supposed to be aware that a shot is about to be fired. I caught it, but obviously the perfectionist director did not.5) Seriously? Someone goes into the United Nations building during the peak of the cold war, kill someone on view of everyone, and still escape the building unchallenged? Perfect, but only if we are talking about Hitchcock's perfect stupidity.I can go on like this for longer, but I think I did deliver my message and can rest my case. Again, I would have been more than happy to have heard an explanation form fanboys (who will sure vote not useful), but unfortunately telling me that Hitchcock is God and that I'm a moron for challenging his divine will is hardly an explanation.5\/10 just because I give many B-Movies a 5.

A black guy who is there on a sports scholarship and he hates it. He calls his black team mates slaves who are no good for anything but running, yet we see him telling the black gang leader that he does not care for education and is only in it for money!!

Many of the funniest moments come from Ms. Sanford's Tillie during her outbursts about black power! There's also some nice moments concerning Tracy and Hepburn on screen together especially when one knows that this was Spencer's final movie before his death.

In dictionaries it shows up as 'elf' or 'magic', however in actual practice the word doesn't mean the woodland spirit, but another kind of magic, the one that stirs the emotions. I'm coming really late to this teenage cult flick, I've done the passing so the rite itself is useless to me now, but the translation of the movie's duende is an interesting problem. Do we accept Donnie Darko's magic as an earnest expression of angst or do we bemoan how unsophisticated it is, perhaps the angst itself, that a young man gets to stand up and lecture the grownups? On one hand, it's the charming combination, the esoteric preamble into an apocalypse of the mind, the perverse parody of a white picket fence society, the youthful rhapsody for understanding and love. To the degree that Richard Kelly is trying to emulate the David Lynch film, I'm left at a distance, amused but not terribly interested by these easy contrasts and the stretch for eccentricity, by the perversion of the moral right or authority.What I appreciate here, like in Gummo or earlier in Godard's Breathless, is the youthful expression, that a young director gets to make a film to tell us what it means to be young, that these feelings are not addressed after the fact. As with the Harmony Korine film, I find the nihilism to be as much a fashion statement as a political expression of disenchantment, and when Richard Kelly speaks of life and death, it's coming from the pretentious point of view of adolescence. Trivial problems overblown, magnified, ruminations from the safe distance of youth. But it's exactly that distance that makes them possible, even gives them a bit of charm.But I also sense a yearning for the presence of a god, plan or meaning in the macrocosm, airheaded perhaps but genuine. I think the tolerance or affection an adult viewer can foster for a film like Donnie Darko, or Gummo indeed, boils down to whether or not we recognize that the young can ask the same questions even from a naive viewpoint, whether or not they can attempt to feel the spectrum of emotion within their limited experience of the world.

As with the Harmony Korine film, I find the nihilism to be as much a fashion statement as a political expression of disenchantment, and when Richard Kelly speaks of life and death, it's coming from the pretentious point of view of adolescence.

I think the tolerance or affection an adult viewer can foster for a film like Donnie Darko, or Gummo indeed, boils down to whether or not we recognize that the young can ask the same questions even from a naive viewpoint, whether or not they can attempt to feel the spectrum of emotion within their limited experience of the world.

In dictionaries it shows up as 'elf' or 'magic', however in actual practice the word doesn't mean the woodland spirit, but another kind of magic, the one that stirs the emotions. I'm coming really late to this teenage cult flick, I've done the passing so the rite itself is useless to me now, but the translation of the movie's duende is an interesting problem. Do we accept Donnie Darko's magic as an earnest expression of angst or do we bemoan how unsophisticated it is, perhaps the angst itself, that a young man gets to stand up and lecture the grownups?

Kinda makes one wonder how did they take over most of Western Europe and were a few hundred miles away from Moscow if they were some retards who $hit their pants on regular basis? Also during the whole movie Germans were being bullied by their sadist superiors for no reason other than the kick of it.Acting was so bad it was almost sad, and battle scenes were something out of a Toho Godzilla movie to say the least. There was a scene in which we were shown that soldiers on both sides are still humans who have feelings, nice, but then there was another one, then another, and yet another that I just gave up and stopped counting when it became one huge cheese festival. There were gaps in the plot, and at times there was no plot at all that it felt as if I was watching a different movie. The extras were horrible too and bad direction was showing in scenes with large masses a scene where wounded Germans were fighting for a place on the last plane home, you can see one of the extras looking at the camera and smiling! And that was not an extra far in the back, he was in the centre of the shot just two feet from the camera!! The only plus of this movie was the use of accurate period pistols and rifles.Otherwise it is a cheap TV like Naziploitation movie in every sense of the word, except that there were no exposed boobies in here to make it even slightly bearable.
