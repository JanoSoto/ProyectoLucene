And even his fighting skills, that brought him to Hollywood in the first place, weren't shown here at all due to the tragic use of the flying wires. Owing to the producers' fear of any injury may hurt their lead; or frankly delay their project, they used these damn wires, in so monotonous way, for maybe 90 % of the action scenes. It made watching Li, sorry.. standing watching Li, meaningless, and the whole thing uninteresting.(Isaiah Washington) was literally provocative whether as an actor or a character. The evil guy can be amusing or attractive sometimes. But here, oh my god. He was the worst stereotype ever as idiot, nuts, and Washington as well (that's heavy for me as one of the biggest non-fans of him !). (Anthony Anderson) was SO LOUD, and not in a good way. And you know what the worst part is? He's acting! His comedy, if we consider it so, is forced and totally unfunny. I hated him to the extent of completing the movie just to see his ass kicked hard. But unfortunately Li's kicks weren't that many. I wanted something equal to the pain that this dude caused to me (a bomb up his fat butt could have been near to pleasant!).(Aaliyah), god bless her soul, wasn't strong enough. Especially with not one acting talent around her. She was good at places, and clueless at others. For one reason, I didn't see exactly why she fell in love with that taxi driver who can't speak English (hear him saying that wath a mistake !). And everybody in the universe knew it  Aaliyah and Li have NO chemistry on-screen. He's like 40, and she's in her early twenties. He's like a bad movie, and she's like a good song!The soundtrack is a piece of hell. If you don't like rap, then this is an exclusive long torment-to-death. However as a fan or not, you must wonder why to crowd a movie with this number of songs? They didn't even express the lead's love or compensate for its dramatic absence!Sometimes the movie pushes you to laugh in the wrong place; for one moment, at the end, Aaliyah's father shoots a guy for ten times but he just wants not to die. I remember asking does anybody turn to the comedy channel while I'm not looking ??!!And the cameo.. My man DMX. He can't act or fight. I think he stipulated that they can't use his songs in the soundtrack unless he has a part. Or maybe they begged him to do it to support a movie starring some guy from Asia and a newcomer singer. Both ways I hated his guts. Plus I can't forget his immortal line, that I will teach to my children advising them to teach it to their children; Guns don't kill people. People kill people I think this is the best thing I have ever heard since Dr. King's speech of I have a dream!I read that there was a kiss between Li and Aaliyah, but it was cut in the final release. Li said later that it was removed because, in the film, a family member is murdered, and it would be inappropriate for him to be kissing a girl immediately afterwards from the rival family. My comment on his comment  BS ! The guy was maybe trying not to lose his new position by harassing the mighty producers and tickling some hard issues, since it's known by heart that a kiss between an Asian and an American soul is still a bit risky thing to be done in some movies, for some studios. It may take time. Just remember that yesterday the Asian in Hollywood movies was nothing but an ugly joke, an ugly enemy, an ugly malicious. Just ugly anyway, and not, by any chance, a respectable character or a big hero.Although there was a lovable try to show the lead characters as humans, not superheroes or lifeless creatures, but that wasn't done with the rest. I think whether you make it as a straight bang bang flick, or something at least as serious as the Romeo reference. This movie was in uneven middle. So I was like in sane-crazy, crazy-sane world all the time !I enjoyed the scene in which Li was using Aaliyah to fight a girl, since he can't hit one. But why I think that this scene in specific was shot by different director ?! However still nothing was like that KILLER Chinese girl on the motorcycle. She was the real good thing about this movie. But they just killed her off after seconds of her appearance&#x85;as you see&#x85;this is a movie that doesn't want to be loved!Finally, recall with me  Li is jumping, wholly illogically, to hit the ball then its players. Li is escaping from the black evil guys while hitting them by unconvincing, rather idiot, moves (how to kick 6 men by rotating one complete horizontal circle in the air without holding to anything ?!). Li at the climax is jumping, as his opponent, at least 3 meters above the land.. to stay there for a while during flapping their legs in the sky! (again without holding to ANYTHING !?). In case if you're asking confusedly like me, the answer for all of these moments' unforgettable oddity is one  the flying wires.

He relies on his book knowledge (he reads everything, his dismayed superiors report as explanation for his feats) and his good looks to get a woman (Faye Dunaway) to help him as he desperately tries to figure out who he can trust, who's trying to kill him, and why.This was one of the first post-Watergate thrillers, and other than of course All The President's Men it seems the most directly in response to the unprecedented betrayals of trust by the government that people were overwhelmed with in the mid-1970s. Redford's Condor is appalled to discover the government will murder innocent people and topple foreign regimes for America's benefit because they imagine it's what the American people want. While this discovery might seem a trifle unsurprising to modern audiences, prior to Watergate and the Pentagon Papers, these ideas were fringe ones at best that most people simply wouldn't have given much credence to. In many ways, this movie mirrors the death of the American public's blind faith in the government.As a film, it's got its issues.

This is frankly hard to believe even if the guy's as handsome as Robert Redford, and the entire romantic subplot of the movie is clumsy at best.This movie is definitely part of a turning point in the spy thriller, where the enemy could very well be one's own government. It also seems to have become an archetype for how Hollywood does spy thrillers, many 90s and 2000s films are variations on the theme of one guy against the CIA and there are clearly shadows of Condor in them.

And Michael Keaton. And Michael Keaton.Keaton is Doug Kinney, so swamped in career and family life that in order to find felicity for himself, he creates a clone to share the burden of domesticity. But one clone turns into two clones turns into three clones&#x85; the complicity confusing his workmates, his wife (Andie MacDowell), and especially himself.Keaton displays his magnificent multifaceted elasticity by playing every clone with a distinct personality - and never lapses or loses conviction in the four different archetypes. Keaton's performances are so subtle, and work so well against each of himself, that we never notice how stunning his portrayals are; how much blood, sweat and CGI must have gone into learning his lines in a certain character and then playing off three other actors who would eventually be replaced by him - and playing off them four different times as four different types!It is a jaw-dropping performance. Clone Number 1 (whom Doug calls 2) is The Bruce Willis - the masculine side of Doug predominant; 3 is Doug's feminine side predominant; when 2 clones himself to make 4, it's a monkey boy, because you know how copies of a copy are not as good as the original... Don't bring analyticity &#x96; or it gets disturbing. So the movie never dwells on the cloning process or its moral implications. The only moral authority is Doug's Rule Number One No one sleeps with my wife except me! Of course, one rainy night when Doug 1 is away, that specificity is not simplicity when Doug's wife wants fluidity&#x85; Keaton is in every single scene, yet because he plays the four personalities so convincingly, when Doug 1 spends so much time offscreen trying to stay on eternal vacation we feel like we're watching three other guys playing Keaton playing Doug!

Penniless and homeless, Henry finds himself a job servicing porta-loos, where he makes friends with workmate Kai (Rich Komenich) who invites Henry to stay with his family, sexy wife Cricket (Kate Walsh) and geeky niece Louisa (Carri Levinson), until he can find more permanent lodgings.When Henry discovers that Kai has been setting fire to warehouses for a little extra cash, his newfound pal cuts him in on the deal; in return, Henry shows Kai how he keeps busy in his spare time by murdering people!Writer\/director Chuck Parello does a pretty good job at emulating McNaughton's style, taking time to build his characters and develop their relationships whilst also presenting scenes of extreme violence in a cold, matter of fact style. At first Neil Giuntoli is hard to accept as Henry, being less physically imposing than Rooker (thanks to his rather short stature), but once he has done away with a few innocent people in brutal and bloody fashion, there is no doubt that he was a good choice for the part.

And the message is, if this monster is what's in front of the camera, who knows how many other monsters are out there -- in the dark? At the heart of this movie is an intriguing contradiction. On the one hand, the chilling madness of Norma Desmond is as real and modern as the ghastly antics of the late Michael Jackson. (Funeral for a chimpanzee, anyone?) On the other hand, the anguish of Joe Gillis at being kept by an older woman is almost (and I do mean almost) too sexist and out of date to keep the viewer involved in the story.Consider how this story would play if the gender roles were reversed. What if Norma Desmond were a tough, male Western star of the silents -- someone like legendary stuntman\/cowpoke Tom Mix. And what if the young screenwriter were a pretty young woman with a cheerful, irreverent, upbeat personality, sort of like Carole Lombard or Katherine Hepburn? If the two of them got together it would seem sweet, romantic, not repulsive and chilling. Particularly if the eager young female helped him to get over the death of a beloved wife, or maybe his horse.The point is, no one would be horrified if a 50 something male star seduced a bright young woman in her late twenties or thirties. In fact it would be regarded as rather romantic by a lot of people.A lot of the horror of SUNSET BOULEVARD comes from an unthinking assumption -- that women with money and power are unnatural creatures and that they can only attract younger men through evil and manipulation. And there's also the double standard that a woman over 50 is no damned good to a man, but a man over 50 is still in his prime.One final thought William Holden had a wonderful career well into his seventies, and deservedly so. One of his last great performances was in THE WILD BUNCH, where he plays an aging outlaw named Pike Bishop. Note that Pike has the same basic concerns as Norma Desmond. Have I outlived my era? Can I still command respect? What was my life worth? Yet Pike's struggles to pull off one last job are not only not laughed at -- they're rendered as poignant, admirable, and unbelievably heroic. Pike plays the kind of noble, courageous life-giving elder whose wisdom and humanity -- and even his violent tragic death -- simply serve to rejuvenate an entire community.That's the kind of part a mature actress should be able to play as well!

Which is why the film suffers and is an example of Hollywood not coming up with anything new and instead resorting to remaking an old movie or old television show, in this case a television show I have never really seen any episodes of in my entire life. I will admit that once in a while Hollywood will hit pay dirt with these remakes as it did with The Fugitive, but these hits are few and far between. Usually you end up with a horrible film like say The Avengers, The Mod Squad, or this movie.

It makes use of magic, but does so not in the context of myth, fairy-tale or fantasy but in the context of contemporary real-life America. The title character, Alice Tate, is an upper-middle-class New York housewife. Alice is married with two children, but her marriage is not a happy one. Her husband Doug is wealthy and good-looking, but cold, dull and unresponsive to her needs. The film explores what happens two strangers come into Alice's life. The first is Joe Ruffalo, a handsome musician to whom she finds herself attracted. The second is the mysterious Chinese herbalist Dr Yang, who is treating her for backache. Dr Yang prescribes a series of herbal treatments for her, but it is clear that these are much more than just backache remedies. Indeed, these herbs have magical properties. One type takes away her inhibitions and make her act on her feelings towards Joe; another type makes her invisible, enabling her to watch both Joe and Doug unseen. A third enables her to communicate with the ghost of her now deceased first lover Ed. The film is very different in its overall tone to Woody's previous offering, Crimes and Misdemeanours made a year earlier. Yet there is also a similarity between the two films. Alice can be seen as continuing the debate about religion which began in the earlier film, Given that Woody is normally thought of as a religious sceptic, Crimes and Misdemeanours came as something of a surprise to me with its positive view of religion, especially the sympathetic view taken of Sam Waterston's Rabbi, a man whose religious faith enables him to bear the prospect of blindness with stoicism. Although physically he is losing his sight, morally he can see more clearly than any other character in that film. In Alice the religious debate takes place in the context of Catholicism rather than Judaism. Although she no longer practises her religion, Alice was raised as a Catholic. (As was Mia Farrow who plays her; Mia's original name was the very Catholic Maria de Lourdes Villiers-Farrow). The film's view of Catholicism is a mixed one. One the one hand, Alice's Catholic upbringing is seen as a source of sexual guilt. On the other hand, Catholicism is also seen as a source of humanitarian idealism. As a girl and young woman, Alice's was to help people like Mother Theresa, whom she greatly admired. As a middle-aged married woman she has lost sight of her idealistic goals and leads a luxurious, materialistic lifestyle, dominated by shopping, beauty treatments and gossip. Religion can therefore be seen as being the partial cause of Alice's problems in that it causes her to feel guilty about her feelings for Joe. (There is a suggestion that her backache is psychosomatically linked to these guilt feelings). It can, however, also be seen as part of the solution to those problems, as she eventually rediscovers her earlier idealism. Another link between this film and Crimes and Misdemeanours lies in their colour schemes. In the earlier film the predominant colours were browns, greys and dull yellows and oranges. Here similar colours predominate, except that they are also relieved by brighter oranges and reds. This may have been intended to symbolise the difference in tone between the two films. Crimes&#x85;.. is one of Woody's darker films, combining humorous and serious stories, although even the humour is often of a dark, cynical nature.

It makes use of magic, but does so not in the context of myth, fairy-tale or fantasy but in the context of contemporary real-life America. The title character, Alice Tate, is an upper-middle-class New York housewife. Alice is married with two children, but her marriage is not a happy one. Her husband Doug is wealthy and good-looking, but cold, dull and unresponsive to her needs. The film explores what happens two strangers come into Alice's life. The first is Joe Ruffalo, a handsome musician to whom she finds herself attracted. The second is the mysterious Chinese herbalist Dr Yang, who is treating her for backache. Dr Yang prescribes a series of herbal treatments for her, but it is clear that these are much more than just backache remedies. Indeed, these herbs have magical properties. One type takes away her inhibitions and make her act on her feelings towards Joe; another type makes her invisible, enabling her to watch both Joe and Doug unseen. A third enables her to communicate with the ghost of her now deceased first lover Ed. The film is very different in its overall tone to Woody's previous offering, Crimes and Misdemeanours made a year earlier. Yet there is also a similarity between the two films. Alice can be seen as continuing the debate about religion which began in the earlier film, Given that Woody is normally thought of as a religious sceptic, Crimes and Misdemeanours came as something of a surprise to me with its positive view of religion, especially the sympathetic view taken of Sam Waterston's Rabbi, a man whose religious faith enables him to bear the prospect of blindness with stoicism. Although physically he is losing his sight, morally he can see more clearly than any other character in that film. In Alice the religious debate takes place in the context of Catholicism rather than Judaism. Although she no longer practises her religion, Alice was raised as a Catholic. (As was Mia Farrow who plays her; Mia's original name was the very Catholic Maria de Lourdes Villiers-Farrow). The film's view of Catholicism is a mixed one. One the one hand, Alice's Catholic upbringing is seen as a source of sexual guilt. On the other hand, Catholicism is also seen as a source of humanitarian idealism. As a girl and young woman, Alice's was to help people like Mother Theresa, whom she greatly admired. As a middle-aged married woman she has lost sight of her idealistic goals and leads a luxurious, materialistic lifestyle, dominated by shopping, beauty treatments and gossip. Religion can therefore be seen as being the partial cause of Alice's problems in that it causes her to feel guilty about her feelings for Joe. (There is a suggestion that her backache is psychosomatically linked to these guilt feelings). It can, however, also be seen as part of the solution to those problems, as she eventually rediscovers her earlier idealism. Another link between this film and Crimes and Misdemeanours lies in their colour schemes. In the earlier film the predominant colours were browns, greys and dull yellows and oranges. Here similar colours predominate, except that they are also relieved by brighter oranges and reds. This may have been intended to symbolise the difference in tone between the two films.

This is the movie where Keanu Reeves gets his butt kicked. A lot. As a matter of fact, at least 6 times he fails in a fight, chase, or action scene. This is the movie where the good guys fail at everything and the bad guys succeed in almost every possible way---whether it is by outsmarting the good guys or because the good guys are idiots. This is the action flick that proves you don't need special effects, but you do need someone in the background keeping tally of who is beating who in the film (Um, Mrs. Bigelow, why is Keanu Reeves getting beat down by a naked woman?)Point Break is one of the signature action flicks of the 90s. Why you ask? Because a bunch of violent hippie-like surfers (that love extreme sports) are robbing banks around California and an ex-football player-turned cop must stop them by becoming one of them. Yep, this plot sounds like it's going somewhere. The main character's name is Johnny Utah. Come on now, any movie with a main character that cool of a name is bound to be a hell of a good time, right? Then we have Patrick Swayze as one of the surfer hippies (awesome performance) and the always-reliable Gary Busey as the partner. This has all the makings of an action classic, and the opening credits just started.The script was clever, and was something very different in the realm of action flicks. This movie was W. Peter Iliff''s best script and it's a shame after Patriot Games he didn't dwell more into the genre. There was only one issue with the script. No, it's not the dialogue, no it's not the pacing, but it's the extremely weak and pathetic main character. Our main character loses so many fights, we stop rooting for him halfway because we are sure the end result would be the same----failure. He doesn't listen, he's not very smart, he's obviously not very strong, and he mellows down to a pathetic wanna-be hero that chases the main villain like a lost puppy. There can be cases of good movies where the villains are just so much smarter than the heroes (The Dark Knight anyone?), but there are some extreme cases in which you wonder why the members of the police force still have their job based off their decision-making. Keanu Reeves in the movie almost loses a fight against surfers, and does indeed lose against a naked woman, against bank robbers, against one guy (multiple times), against a man on fire, against gravity, and couldn't even succeed in a single chase. And he was a football player. Did I already say he lost to a female taking a shower? I did? I'll say it again anyway. Gary Busey should have ditched this guy halfway through the production, but then we the audience would definitely have known by then that Mr. Utah just wasn't going to win at anything. Unfortunately, he stuck around, giving Utah hope. Oops. Luckily we have great direction from Kathryn Bigelow and superb stuntwork. Bigelow must have been against special effects, because this entire movie is stuntwork and pyrotechnics-driven, as we see skydiving, surfing, crazy stunts, and one of the best on-foot chases in the history of cinema----despite it ending weakly. Bigelow is one of the more underrated directors out there, as she avoids pulling punches and avoids the clichés throughout the entire production. She also crafts great performances from Busey, Swayze, and also John C. McGinley. As for Keanu Reeves, he does a decent job, but his character prevents him from delivering anything memorable. Mr. Utah is a law enforcement joke. Bottom Line Point Break is a swell action flick, as long as you can get past Keanu getting smacked around constantly, as he loses fights, loses arguments, constantly loses control of the situation at hand, and constantly fails in achieving his goal. It was laughable the amount of times he screws up, and the amount of times his peers screwed up. No wonder the bank robbers were having no problems taking over the city banks.

Soon after he falls for the murdered specter named Mary Plunkett (Daryl Hannah) and her killer husband Martin Brogen(Liam Neeson)who stabbed her on their wedding night wrongly believing that she loved someone else.Later weird things start happening to the guests and the very real ghosts of the castle begin to make their presences known especially Martin who won't give up on trying to seduce Sharon. (funniest parts of the movie if you ask me).On Halloween night things come to ahead and Jack and Mary get it on which afterwords puts him up the the ultimate test of love. Sharon unknowingly gives up her life for Mary and takes her place to be with Martin.By the end everyone is happily ever after. Honestly Liam Neeson was my favorite character of the whole thing and Peter O'Toole was brilliant. I believe this is somewhat based off a much older movie but for the life of me i can't remember the title any who, watch it on a rainy day and i promise you won't regret it.
