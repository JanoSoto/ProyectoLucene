Still, it's not as good as the Broadway musical, by Charles Strouse, Martin Charnin and Thomas Meehan which in turn, is based on Little Orphan Annie, the 1924 comic strip by Harold Gray which in turn, was originally a poem by James Whitcomb Riley. The reasons for this was a few changes. The film add a lot of new songs, and replace others. While, at the same time, adding more comical campy elements to the film that musical lovers didn't like. Such as adding a few outlandish characters from the comic strip back in the musical version like Punjab and the Asp. The comic strip was more adventure series, while the musical is a bit too political with the commentary, that kinda stray from the story of Annie and more about how depressing the Great Depression was. So I kinda like this film version as it mixed both of them. The film is about the story of Annie (Aileen Quinn) who is a mischievous orphan from New York City who is taken in for the weekend by America's richest billionaire Oliver Warbucks (Albert Finney) who is trying to improve his image. At first, Mr. Warbucks didn't want the child, wanting a boy, but she grew on him to the point, that he wanted to adopt the child from the cruel alcoholic orphanage's supervisor Miss Hannigan (Carol Burnett). Instead, Miss Hannigan wasn't going to do that, seeking fortune. She plan out to trick Warbucks, by having her con-brother, Rooster (Tim Curry) and his girlfriend, Lily (Bernadette Peters) pose as Annie's parents to get the reward money. All the actors did great in their roles. I know a lot of people were getting anger at Aileen Quinn as Annie for being too cute, but I thought she did pretty OK. At less, she wasn't as annoying as the 'Oh my Goodness' girl. Drew Barrymore almost got the role, and I can see her maybe pulling it off, but her suppose co-star, Jack Nicolson as Daddy Warbucks. No, I don't see him in the role at all. I have to say, Albert Finney fits the role despite not being a good singer. I'm just glad, he barely sung in the movie. I don't see him, pulling off 'Something is missing' song. Thank goodness, that song was cut from the film. 'Sign' is so far the worst song in the movie as it's seem like Warbucks knew about Miss Hannigan's cruelty to the girls, but just blackmail her to give Annie up. I always found that scene, disturbing. I thought, if he knew that abuse was going on. He should had call the police on her. In my opinion, Carol Burnett and Tim Curry make the movie, watchable. East Street' and 'Little Girls were great villain songs. Ann Reinking as Grace Farrell was OK, but most of her songs were pretty mediocre. I didn't like 'We got Annie' one bit and 'I think I would like it here' is cheesy. It did show her dancing skills, but it was just not needed. I have to say for the film to replace the 'NYC song with Let's go to the Movies' was a bad mistake. ''NYC help set the settling of the story so well, while 'Let's go to the movies' just doesn't fit in with the movie. The movie wasted scenes of them watching another movie. It was so annoying. By far, the worst thing, the movie did is move the 'tomorrow' song later in the film to a scene that should had been cut from the film when they visit the president at the White House. Honestly, did we really need to see the president? I didn't like how the film turn the song from Annie's hope for a better future, into a political statement. I know the original musical had We'd like to Thank You, Herbert Hoover and 'New Deal for Christmas', but I thought it was good idea to cut those songs from the film. I really don't think people would like to hear songs about how poor, people are, and see Annie getting spoil by a rich war drumming millionaire. It would make Daddy Warbucks seem unlikable to the common people watching the film. The scene where 'tomorrow' was supposed to play was replace with mean-spirited songs about a dog. I really didn't think Sandy the dog needed a song. Thank Goodness, they cut the songs 'You wouldn't be an orphan too long'. I really don't see a song about J. Edgar helping the story much. I did like how the film, reprised 'Maybe' throughout the film. It really set the mood of the story and plot. By far, my favorite songs are 'it's a hard knock life' and 'we've never fully dress without a smile'. Both are the extreme ends of each other, while 'Tomorrow' seem to be the balance to the film. While, 1999's Annie was a little bit better, I think director John Huston gave us a pretty okay movie. At less, it's better than Annie A Royal Adventure! (1995). Yes, there were some major differences between the stage musical and this film version by John Huston, but overall no matter, if it's Christmas or Fourth of July, rich or poor, watching Annie is a joy!

It's just that there is so very much to love in this classic, I remember it all so well... Pinocchio is for me, Disney homebase. I find it the most magical, mystical, frightening - from my point of view truly the best work they ever did. It's so magnificent in so many different ways and it will hold up forever. There's so many great characters, Dickie Jones' voice was very cute, I actually learned how to whistle with the help of the second song! The Blue Fairy is a stunningly radiant gossamer creation of heavenly grace, in as much her warm bearing as her design. She breaks her own rule of not helping out twice! I love the bratty little expressions of impish Figaro. Gepetto's so mean when he's using the as-yet inanimate(and ~creepy!~) Pinocchio to spook Figaro and kick his butt! And I love sweet Cleo the goldfish and how she wants to be the stubborn Figaro's friend! I find the scene really charming and funny where Gepetto goes out to search for Pinocchio and Figaro immediately wants to eat his dinner but Cleo forbids it! She even manages to be cute during a very sad scene where she's preparing her own grave! The delicate effect of her fins as she swirls about is superb. I love the numerous rich details and touches that are in any given scene, particularly the opening sequence with all the precious clocks trinkets and music boxes, which I think is one of the more visually breathtaking moments in the film. I still remember how I felt when I first saw it when I was really little. Everything about all the sights and sounds of the intricate little devices and toys entranced me, and filled my young mind with wonder so... Still does! I haven't ever lost that whenever I watch that part. The way Geppeto switches everything on to celebrate mirrors the ending.  The enchanting and brilliant sequence where they're under the sea is my all-time favourite underwater Disney animating, even more so than The Little Mermaid. It's really funny with all the sea life cautiously following close behind, and Jiminy riding on a seahorse! Good job they dived in when they did, Jiminy was about to transform into a little asshopper! Even the lowly clam has learned to fear the wrath of Mighty Monstro! The final act is just incredible and ups the ante in terms of action no limit! Just what the heck kinda demonic whale was Monsto meant to be anyway? He's more like a colossal, juggernaut engine of towering destruction than a living creature. There's such an awesome sense of momentum and force in the movements as he twists and bulldozes through the ocean after them like a freight-train, only to end up inadvertently pushing them out of harm's reach in the end with his own power.  I love how the film is at times bleak and poignant, like when Gepetto's searching for Pinocchio in the rain and the coach that he just happens to be on goes right by. So close and yet so far... And in the scene that always gets me a little teary eyed where they return to the cottage to find it barren and empty. How sad that is. There's something about a home being all abandoned and forlorn that just breaks my heart. And there's also the lament scene inside the whale. These parts are not very reassuring, but they sure are captivating. Although much of it is bright and whimsical, I also greatly appreciate the darkness of this movie. Not everything works out perfectly nice for everybody. How quickly Stromboli becomes terrifying as he flies off into a rage and violently slams little Pinoccio into the cage of certain doom, switching the whole tone of the suspiciously jovial scene as he does so. And the donkey transformation was even more horrendous than I remembered! The way Lampwick cries out for his mama is so grisly and disturbing. And all the poor misbehaving boys who are just left as donkeys on cursed Pleasure Island forever and never seen again, and the wicked man running the place who's never defeated - there's some seriously grim stuff! The fear in some of the darker scenes is still relatable. This world can be a very cruel place, and especially as kids we can never be too sure about strangers, even if they appear very generous at first. And the chilling glamour of Pleasure Island teaches that, if something seems too good to be true it probably is, and those are still good lessons I think. And although the ending is a happy one and does indeed leave you with a positive and hopeful feeling, the movie still takes you on many emotional twists and turns before it reaches that grand and marvelous point. My last word might sound a bit corny..but here goes! What they did with this, their work, way back then, it was beautiful, and we'll always remember it.

Despite contrary belief, don't let anyone fool you into thinking this is a horror film, or any sort of genre piece for that matter. It is not. It is also not a psychological thriller. It is a thriller, and it is indeed psychological, but its no 'Seven' or 'Silence of the Lambs' and for a good reason. It is less about being unable to trust one person, and more about being unable to trust anyone. The film begins with a Christian police officer, arriving on duty, at the island of Summersile, a place that appears to be a close, friendly and tight knit island of happy-go-lucky Scots who are all apparently unaware of his reasons for being there. He passes a photograph of a young girl, said to have gone missing, amongst a group of elderly fishermen, who analyze the photograph. They deny knowing said girl so quickly that the viewer immediately grows suspicious. So does the protagonist. The thing that differentiates The Wicker Man from most films of its kind is that our hero is smart. He's quick on his feet and we get the feeling that he feels the same discomfort as we do, as it occurs. There is never an instance where we feel he may make a wrong decision that may deem him dislikable or deserving of his fate. Despite the dramatically stubborn religious pride he wears on his sleeve, we are not prepared to see the wool pulled over his eyes any time soon. He is directed by the fisherman to a small market, owned by the alleged mother of the girl in the photograph (also the woman responsible for writing the SOS). He confronts her, but as we know, the film can't wrap up with a simple, It's alright, I found her already, thanks for your help. She also denies not only writing the letter, but also that the girl in the photograph is her daughter. The paranoia worsens. We see a clearly, logically thinking person begin to stumble over himself, and rightfully so. Every piece of information he is fed seems to contradict the last, and no one seems to have any idea what he is talking about. What adds to the eeriness of the film is that there are no dramatic scenes where characters crack under pressure. There's no 'good cop, bad cop' routine, where civilians of the island are wrongfully interrogated. Instead we see people calmly and cruelly tampering with a sane person's sanity. One big, awful joke is being played on Sergeant Howie, and he's aware of it, too. The point where we begin to feel bad is when the lies and falsities become so convoluted, where we can't really blame him for being tricked. His fate is silently but surely being determined by an entire town's watchfulness and ill-informed belief system. For a good majority of the film we are falling victim to the people of Summersile's joke, too, and hoping for the best. Prior to cell phones, and wi-fi, and just about everything else, Howie has no communication with the outside world. He has traveled long and far to take part in his own torment. It hurts for us, too. This poor chap just wants to do his job and go home, and we know thats not going to happen. I have no intention of saying anymore due to the fact that this film is almost essential to those that prefer discomfort to horror, spooks over scares and atmosphere over guts and gore.

Then when it came out on video, my group of friends watched it and loved it so much that they got themselves a copy of it to watch it constantly. The video then went missing after somebody lent it to their boss.When I first watched Romper Stomper, I watched it through the eyes of a lout, and thought that it was cool. This time I watched it as a piece of literature and suddenly saw that it is a superbly crafted film with very deep characters. The film revolves around a gang of skinheads who live in Footscray, an industrial suburb in Melbourne. The leader of the gang is Hando (Russel Crowe), a neo-Nazi, and his side kick is Davey, a more quiet and passive skinhead. One day in the pub they meet Gaye, a young girl who just left her boyfriend and is looking for excitement, so she hooks up with Hando.It is the characters that really make this movie. The first thing to look at is Hando, because his personality makes up the personality of the whole gang. He is the leader and what he says, goes. Hando is a nativist, meaning that the only native race in Australia is the WASP, the White Anglo-Saxon Protestant. His neighbourhood is being bought out by Vietnamese and this he resents. He believes that Australia is a white nation and the Asians are corrupting it, so they make a habit of beating them up. Hando is fighting a war that he cannot win, because the more he attacks the Vietnamese, the angrier he makes them, and in the end he brings the whole community onto his gang. This riot signals the beginning of the end of his gang because up until that moment they have not been defeated.Hando suffers from a fatal flaw, and that is his obsession with his hatred of anything Asian. At the opening of the film, he encounters a couple of Asian girls at the railway station, so he and his gang beat them up. This is not a noble thing to do, but rather the result of an obsession. The furthest extent of his flaw is during a break-in he sees a Japanese car, so he turns his mind from the job at hand to totally decimate the car. This leads to the owner of the house getting to them with a gun forcing them to flee and leaving all of the stuff behind.Hando is the ultimate in self-centeredness, yet he refuses to acknowledge his flaw. When Gaye exposes his flaw to him, instead of listening to her, he throws her out. In fact, his obsession leads him to severely disrespect the woman that is supposed to be his girlfriend. When she cooks dinner, instead of eating it, he attacks it for being Italian and throws it away. Yet without his gang, Hando is nothing. As we watch his gang diminish, we see the once proud and menacing figure that is Hando also diminish. His clothes become more ragged and his appearance more desperate. The scene when he arrives in Davey's bedroom after his gang are all gone depicts a man who has lost everything. And his final death, by the standard issue Hitler Youth knife, is fitting for one who followed the world view of Adolf Hitler. Even then the knife was made in 1944, at a time when all was lost for Germany.Davey is Hando's best friend, yet rather than equals, he is the one that follows Hando everywhere. Hando treats Davey as a child, and in a way he is. Davey does not have the burning passion that Hando has, instead he quiet and very submissive. Yet Hando realises that he needs Davey's friendship. He lets him go easily, yet when his gang is all gone, he comes crawling back to him. Davey claims to be Hando's best friend, yet there seems to be little interaction between them until right at the end. Hando does father Davey, as seen when he makes Davey comfortable after finding him passed out on the stairs. Yet it is the scene of the beach when we really see the finest interaction between Hando and Davey.Hando is the one who has all the words, and his words work to sink deep into Davey's minds. Hando believes that Davey needs him and tries to convince him to dump Gaye, for she is only a burden too them. It is not Davey that needs Hando but rather Hando that needs Davey. As mentioned earlier, without his gang, Hando is nothing, and it is when his gang is gone, Hando comes crawling to Davey to plead with him to join him. Even then, Hando kills a service station attendant to force Davey to stay with him. Davey is easily manipulated and persuaded, and it is because of this that Hando wants him around because he knows that Davey won't speak back to him.Romper Stomper is seriously a superb movie. The script is finely crafted and a lot of thought has been put into the characters, their relationships, their traits and their flaws. Some have claimed that there is a lot of Hollywood sensationalism in the movie, but after watching it recently I am very much inclined to disagree. This is not a Hollywood movie, nor is it a movie exploring the world of Skinheads and squatters, but it is the tragic story of Hando who, through his obsession, brings destruction not only onto himself but onto all of his followers.

I personally felt that it was trying to say to not throw your life away after you graduate from college. The young Braddock man, played to a tee by Dustin Hoffman, was thoroughly confused, and Mrs. Robinson, (which was one of the beautiful Anne Bancroft's most memorable roles which she played well) only made matters worse for him by tempting him to do the wrong he did. It was a character study which delved into the characters' lives. There was also symbolism found in the production; for example, when Braddock was sitting at a zoo, in a cage nearby were three monkeys, and in light of the situation in which Braddock found himself, anyone would have to wonder if this graduate's thinking was any higher than that of the lower form of animals. William Daniels did well as a firm and concerned father of Braddock, and Elizabeth Wilson did fairly well as Braddock's mother. Murray Hamilton showed forth outstanding acting ability as Mr. Robinson, the man who believed that Braddock would be good for his daughter Elaine whom Braddock had been dating; of course, his attitude toward him changed after his affair with Mrs. Robinson, and he was understandably bitter. Though she was not in it as much as most of the others, the beautiful Katherine Ross stole the show as Elaine; this is the role for which she was best known, it seems. The ending was good, though very comical. But again, all the main personages in the movie were immature, to say the least, so you would have to, again, wonder if they ever really graduated.

I enjoy 13 Going On 30, but this one can't be beat. As silly as the concept is, it's done so adroitly, and it's so worker, Josh might be decent at this grown up thing. This review is for likable, you can't help but go along for the ride. It also has the right principles, and a great message. This movie is telling you that you should always be a kid, despite how old you are. You should never grow up too fast, and while it's good to be responsible, being young at heart is important as well. I'm 28 years old, and I can honestly say I wish I was a kid still. The only good things about being an adult are alcohol and women. Tom Hanks is utterly fantastic as the big kid, but it's his friendship with the young, Jared Rushton, which is the most memorable. I loved their scenes together. The romance between Tom Hanks & Elizabeth Perkins is not only genuine, but adorable. It was really neat to watch Perkin's character evolve from serious to who she really was deep down. You do have to suspend your disbelief with this movie, obviously, but it's one of the most genuine films you'll ever witness. My favorite scene in this movie is when Tom Hanks & Robert Loggia play on a giant piano. I couldn't stop grinning throughout that scene. The ending is alternately uplifting & sad. It really hits home for me. Final Thoughts If you don't like this movie, I really don't know what you want from a movie. It's impossible to dislike.

He receives a card that says his wish has been granted, but merely shrugs it off. He wakes up the next morning, shocked to discover he is now a grown up. He is forced to cope with the pressures of society, and even has to get a job. With the help of his friend Billy, and a little love from a co- the extended edition. I enjoy 13 Going On 30, but this one can't be beat. As silly as the concept is, it's done so adroitly, and it's so worker, Josh might be decent at this grown up thing. This review is for likable, you can't help but go along for the ride. It also has the right principles, and a great message. This movie is telling you that you should always be a kid, despite how old you are. You should never grow up too fast, and while it's good to be responsible, being young at heart is important as well. I'm 28 years old, and I can honestly say I wish I was a kid still. The only good things about being an adult are alcohol and women. Tom Hanks is utterly fantastic as the big kid, but it's his friendship with the young, Jared Rushton, which is the most memorable. I loved their scenes together. The romance between Tom Hanks & Elizabeth Perkins is not only genuine, but adorable.

But amidst this visual feast are flaws that prevented a higher score from me. The first is the plot itself, which revolves around a woman, a former prostitute, and her three lovers- all of whom are major characters in the film who battle each other in some form or another. Actually, I read this afterward on IMDb. You could have fooled me on that one. Women have no place in a Leone western to begin with, and Claudia simply did not have the acting range to pull it off. She was in a lot of scenes but I never thought of her as the focus of the film. Sophia Loren cast in the role might have brought a magnetic quality to the woman, perhaps, but not Claudia. Which comes to the miscasting. With Leone's star firmly in the ascendant, it is clear that all of Hollywood wanted in on this one, and Sergio obliged, to the detriment of the movie. Jason Robards, as a commenter already noted, is dreadful as Cheyenne. He brings nothing to the movie and his hang-dog acting style is irritating and tiresome. Bronson as the protagonist Harmonica is too short and ethnic looking to be convincing as a tough guy. And the harmonica playing hook of the movie is laughable, though it makes some convoluted sense at the end of the movie. Hey, a tough guy has to be ready to draw his gun at ALL times. If you play a harmonica, not only do you use two hands, but you must concentrate on the melody. Just didn't work for me. The main theme was superb, but the secondary theme- where the banjo is being plucked in a jaunty tune- was out of place and WAY overused. Other plot holes are where the heck did McBain get the money to build a big house and purchase lumber and supplies to build an entire town? And if he had money, why would he marry a New Orleans prostitute? So a great movie, for it is a Leone, but with many, many flaws.

This ended up pulling a tree down in my yard and leaving me without power for a week. So where was I that Saturday? Standing out in line in front of our local theater for a midnight screening of The Rocky Horror Picture Show. This was the third year I had done the Rocky Horror Midnight Experience. The theater was less crowded then in the previous years, only a little more then half-full. The crowd was still decent, shouting along, dancing, having a lot of fun, as you'd expect. However, maybe it was just me and my lack of sleep, but it seems the excitement peaked a little early. The oddly poetic image of toilet paper and toast filling the air above us, silhouetted against the screen, a little pass the hour point, seemed the natural conclusion to the night. It's also fair to say the shadow cast this year wasn't as good as 2010's. They weren't bad. Everyone was enthusiastic and in the spirit. Janet was very busty, which I didn't mind, and the actor playing Rocky was very popular with the ladies. (And seemed to be smuggling a roll of quarters in his speedo.) Overall, everyone just seemed a little less in to it. Anyway The movie itself. Is it actually any good? That's an important question. From a critical perspective, it remains divisive. I found myself feeling a little bored with the picture this year. It's certainly an entertaining film. The music is roundly excellent. The cast is extremely good, with everyone inhabiting their roles fully, to the point were this film has defined most of the cast's careers. Tim Curry is obviously the stand-out performances but this year I found myself admiring Barry Boswick's comedic timing. The production values are actually pretty good too. Most of the jokes land successfully. In particularly I love Charles Gray's deadpan framing device and the long sequence of name-calling. There's enough general weirdness in the performances and delivery to add some appeal. But from a writing perspective, I found myself wondering. The pace meanders quite a bit and several of the songs don't actually contribute to the plot. The latter half of the second act basically lumbers around until we get to the floor show at the end. Dr. Scott doesn't actually contribute much to the story. Frank is the most popular character in the film even though, you know, he's actually a textbook psychopath, right down to the charisma. He doesn't care about anyone but himself, manipulates and hurts the people around without pausing, not to mention murdering someone with a pickaxe because they glanced at his boyfriend. The rule clue that he's an asshole is that, despite doing all this awful stuff, he still considers himself the hero of the movie. I'm Going Home is basically Frank telling us that he's the victim, of an uncaring world where he doesn't fit in. He imagines an audience cheering and applauding for him, in a blatant act of self-deluded narcissism. The movie acknowledges this by killing him off at the end. The ending, which leaves our lead trio collapsed on the ground, worn out by their embrace of hedonism, says that attitude of sexual wantonness is bad.

The themes are jumbled and uncertain is what I'm saying.It's possible the people who made the movie were too high to notice this disparity.

The dedication at the end is to Don Simpson, and it is always sad to see such a talented person, or in fact any person, die, but that is the nature of this corrupt world.A bunch of highly trained marine terrorists take over Alcatraz, secure hostages, set up missiles carrying very nasty diseases, and demand that they receive recognition and that the families of their dead receive proper compensation. The FBI are called in along with Godspeed (Nicholas Cage) to try and diffuse the situation. They then go to Mason (Sean Connery), the only guy to have ever escaped from Alcatraz, to get back in. As Godspeed is the only person who can neutralise the gas, he is also sent in, much to his protestations.The one thing I thought about this movie when watching it was that it was somewhat unbelievable that such a thing would happen, and if it did, there would be very little the authorities could do without instigating a plan of acceptable losses. I am not saying that the world is a rosy place - far from it - but the nasty things that happen usually are mass shootings, and the occasional fanatical cult, such as the Branch Davidians (at least in the United States).The actions were simply to be recognised. The troops in this siege were special US operatives that simply do not exist. When one of them dies, the truth is covered up and the reply is that they were killed in a training exercise. No compensation or anything is paid to the grieving widow. When people sign up though they generally are told of what they are going up against and agree to such clauses.

Such things may not work well in a family, but then there are lots of confidential matters flying around everywhere so one cannot really complain.All in all, this is a great action movie if one is willing to suspend their disbelief, which we all must do in the long run. There are unbelievable aspects to this movie, but one must understand that it is one of those movies that give the viewers that false hope that our problems can be solved with the brave actions of a single man - and in essence that is truth as Jesus was a single man as he did indeed solve all of our important problems.

I am not much of a fan of Mel Brook's movies and quite recently have lost interest in the send-up genre of comedy. There were some aspects of this movie that were redeeming but in general my opinion remains the same; I am not a fan of Mel Brook's movies.The characters in this movie I thought were good. That is until Prince John came into the picture. That guy's acting (I don't know who it was) was atrocious and really lowered my opinion of a movie that I had little of in the first place. On the redeeming side of things, I thought Carey Ellis (I believe his name to be) really suited the role of Robin Hood and in a way, thought he would have been much better in a serious movie that in this. The blind butler Blinkin and the Moor Achoo were also cool (though the Achoo joke stretched quite thin by the end of the movie).Comedy (here I go, spoiling the movie by critically examining the comic features of the movie &#x96; well I don't care because I am not that thrilled with it anyway). There is the stock sexual humour, though not as much as some movies, and in this movie it tends to be much more blatant. There is also a lot of anachronistic humour &#x96; basically saying things that obviously cannot be around in 12th century England. As this is a send up, the other Robin hood movies are also sent up. I guess this can be summed up in on line; unlike some Robin Hoods, I, have an English accent. And a very fine one at that. Just to finish it off there is also the stock toilet humour that one cannot get away from (though in my humble opinion, I prefer toilet humour to sexual humour).My gripe with the movie comes very much at the end. Sexual humour and chastity belts aside, it was the abolition of the marriage vowels that really put me off the movie. A marriage is not a simple, I do, I do, it is a promise that you will be there for each other until the day one of you dies. A marriage is a life long commitment &#x96; something of which this movie was making a mockery. In my honest opinion, if you can't keep the commitment, then don't get married.

The Replacement Killers is a mix between Hong Kong Cinema and Hollywood. The ending is good but still very Hollywood though the action and the story in a sense is very Hong Kong. The main character, John Lee, is a hired killer that has a special weapon, and that is the hand gun. He doesn't run round with machine guns blowing away villains, nor does he jump into a martial arts extravaganza, but just relies upon his pistols. Thus there are a lot of gunfights in this movie as the police and a criminal organisation try to put down this rogue killer.John Lee is a professional assassin who has been blackmailed by a criminal organisation to kill people for them. The son of the boss, Mr Weing, is killed in a drug bust and Mr Weing decides that he wants the son of the cop who killed his son dead. This is an eye for an eye mentality. The problem arises when John Lee discovers that the person he has to kill is a seven year old boy. Thus he refuses to do the job, angers Mr Weing and is hunted down to be punished.This movie is about style and pride in one's job. John Lee is a killer but there is a line he does not cross. He only kills those that he has been paid to kill and those who are trying to kill him. He is not ruthless, which Mr Weing considers to be a flaw, and will not kill innocent bystanders nor will he kill children. One gets the impression that John Lee did not want to start killing anyway.There are a number of similarities between the Replacement Killers and the Killer.

I still don't really know but Baraka had that impact on me. This movie came out in 1992 and shows life in many shows and forms. It is a strange but intriguing genre of film but it is amazing. Baraka means hope in English but what it actually means is up to the viewer. From the streets of New York, to tribes in Africa, to clouds floating above mountains, Baraka dives deep into the planet we live on and really made me think.The shots in this movie, with the music intertwined, were beautiful. A New York Street is shown with the traffic moving like clockwork while drums are playing almost in sync with the traffic. The entire hour and a half movie is like this. This movie touches upon every religion and group of people we have on Earth. The audience sees the different people in the world but we also see how similar we are. Yes a typical American lifestyle is a lot different than the people in other countries that have tattoos and piercings all over their body, but seeing how we share similar problems is brilliant. Throughout the movie we see the positive and negative aspects of our world, past and present. People are shown happy and sad but no matter what the culture there are shots of people staring right into the camera and into the depths of my soul. They break the cinema wall, in a regular movie actors never stare into the camera, but with Baraka regular people stare right into the camera and the emotional impact is huge. Children stare and you wonder what they are thinking about, are they happy or sad. Most stares are blank and innocent. It shows how innocent people really are and how we take those innocents away.This movie really made me think about the word we live in and how people treat each other. People are so cruel to each other for no reason. People discriminate based on religion, why? This movie shows each religion I can think of and they basically follow the same principal. We as a species are so similar to each other but we treat one another like garbage. There are shots of Auschwitz and the Cambodian massacre. Human skills and bones still sitting there. These people were killed for no reason and as a viewer it's sad. I loved this movie. It made me think and want to change. I don't judge people but it made me want to make a greater effort to treat people better in general.Nature of our world is also beautiful. There are shots of animals, specifically monkeys and it is adorable. There is a sequence very early on of a monkey hanging out in a hot bath and it just sits there. A raindrop slightly falls on his nose and it just stars at it as if it's annoyed. It is subtle things like this that I really loved. Nature is truly beautiful if you look at it the right way. Shots of nature were the ones I liked the best, especially waterfalls. I don't know why but I love waterfalls. I also loved the clouds running over mountains like a strong river current. It looked like somebody was stretching out a cotton ball for miles and miles. Music makes the movie. If you don't believe me, then you're dumb for one. Watch this movie and tell me you didn't like the music in this movie. Philip Glass composed the music and after I saw this movie I immediately got the soundtrack. It's so beautiful and captivating. It captures each individual moment perfectly. Sometimes there are different cultures singing or chanting and sometimes it is natural sound from the world itself. It's repetitive and slow but effective.Overall, Baraka is a masterpiece. I have never seen a film like this but I want to see more. This is a rare and beautiful genre that makes you think about the world we live in. A movie like this can't be too long and it can be a little boring at times but I watched this movie in the proper state of mind. I strongly suggest you watch this movie in the proper state of mind, you won't regret it. I will see this movie again and the upgraded blu ray made it ten times better.

A spoof of all those 1950's B-class science-fiction films and comic books (the scene with the Buckaroo Banzai comic book should tell you that). The closest movie I can compare it to is Big trouble in Little China or Monthy Python making fun of science fiction. It never takes itself to seriously. It's sort a joke on itself.What we have here is a pseudo science fiction comedy . All the science here is just one black joke &#x96; it's a parody of gibberish science you can find in many old movies. It's one of those love it or hate it movies. I don't think it's a masterpiece , but it's definitely not a piece of s*** that many IMDb reviewers call it.TAOBBATED is a movie you have to watch at least 2 times just to understand what the heck is going on. On repeated viewings you will be able to notice many small jokes you might have failed to notice . For example I didn't understood why Doctor Lizardo (the main villain) destroyed the arcade game until I've noticed on third watch it was BUCKAROO BANZAI arcade game ! TAOBBATED has a weird sense of humor &#x96;you either get it or don't get it. Some jokes don't really have a punch line (the watermelon) . Some are intelligent &#x96; instead of Green Berets we have Blue Blazers ! I love  the billboard The future begins tomorrow , the John something aliases , No matter where you go, there you are. , the coolest ending credits ever made.The cast is impressive with some future stars in it. Peter Weller (Robocop) gives a good performance as Buckaroo Banzai &#x96; modern Renaissance Man who is a rock musician\/scientist\/ neurosurgeon\/action hero . He plays his character with dead-pan seriousness , which gives good comedic effect , considering all the crazy things going on. He breaks it few times (his subsequent detection of the sinister Red Lectroid agents , every scene with Penny). Ellen Barkin (Sea of love) is hot in every outfit she appears and she has great chemistry with Weller. Jeff Goldblum (The fly) is good as the mild mannered sheriff. Christopher Lloyd (Back to the future) is fun as the arrogant John Bigboote. The true star however is John Lithgow (Cliffhanger) as Doctor Lizardo, twisted fascist alien. I love his voice , his Italian accent , his facial expressions. He's a scene stealer with his over-the-top performance.The plot is quite innovative. Inter dimensional alien invasion theme in contrast to aliens from outer space which has since been overused many times feels very fresh. Screenplay by Earl Mac Rauch is full of dry humor and action. Director WD Richter obviously directed Buckaroo to be a cult movie. Music by Michael Boddicker is really good. Atmospheric and upbeat works well for this comic-book like adventure. I love the Buckaroo Banzai theme.The bad things ? The Hong Kong Cavaliers . With the exception of Jeff Goldblum they are rather bland characters . Not really interesting for the viewer , because the filmmakers never explored their personalities. This is a very low-budget movie. The Red Lectroid bivouac was actually an abandoned Firestone tire factory. It does look a bit dated with it's costumes and set designs.

The love story isn't given all that much time to develop.A sequel was planned called Buckaroo Banzai against The World Crime League .

She has a great song & she is evil but also entertaining at the same time. The songs in this movie are fantastic. Part of Your World is my favorite Disney song (tied with Once Upon a Dream). Under the Sea is great. Every song in this movie is great. My one complaint about this movie is Flounder & Scuttle are annoying but I enjoy all the other characters.

The movie is a action movie but there are a few things that stand out and that is the character of Robocop - rather than simply being an emotionless killing machine, like the Terminator, it is a being struggling with its humanity and duty to serve. It also shows intelligence as it looks not only at its prime directives, but at a forth hidden directive.The story is based around a lot of things. It is set in the future where the signs of industrialisation are showing on the world and America is quickly disintegrating (gee, might even be now). What one must remember is that this is the first of a trilogy and more is unfolded in further movies. The giant in this world is Omni Consumer Products (OCP) and they are based in Detroit and have plans to create a new city. Unfortunately crime is running rampant in the city, led by the crime lord Clarance Bardiager, and the cops are fighting a loosing battle. OCP attempts to implement a new droid, ED-209, but is does not work, killing an executive in a board meeting. Vice President Dick Jones is pushing for the ED-209 unit, but a younger executive has an idea, Robo-cop.Alex Murphy, a recent transfer, is then seriously injured in a nasty altercation with Clarence Bardeger and his gang, and is rushed to hospital where he dies on the hospital table. His body is appropriated by OCP and he is turned into Robocop, the ultimate law enforcer. They believe that he is just a machine controlled by a human brain, but we slowly notice that he still has his personality and his memories. The first example of this is that when he is asked to list his directives, he gives the main three, and then searches and discovers a forth hidden one.This movie is a character study of Robocop set in the background I have described. It is a background of corporate struggles, escalating crime, and blackmail. As Robocop is becoming embroiled in the corporate struggles and lies, he is trying to rediscover his identity and convince himself that he is alive. We learn more about the Robocop units in the next movie, but in this one we simply see a man dedicated to enforcing the law.One person recognises him, and that is his former partner. Even though she only worked with Murphy for one day, she instantly recognised one of his mannerisms and realised that this Robocop was made from the remains of Murphy. As the movie progresses, Robocop slowly comes explore his memories and seeks to bring himself back to life. Everywhere he looks he sees the remnants of a dead Murphy all except for his former partner, who recognises that Murphy has been resurrected in the form of a very strong Robocop (we know that he is not indestructible). The epiphany is when he gets his partner to adjust his targeting and his shoots the canisters of babyfood that he was being fed. He is not a baby, he is Alex Murphy. And for the rest of the movie he has his helmet removed.Also in this movie, the Old Man, the managing director of OCP, seems to be the good guy. The bad guy is VP Dick Johnson, who is consorting with criminals and manipulating things to give him more money and power. He wants the ED-209 to succeed because he knows that a faulty robot brings much more money to OCP than does a perfect Robocop. Unfortunately for Dick, Murphy blows away an ED-209 within two seconds (though his first encounter is not to crash hot, but then he was caught by surprise).I just love this movie, as one can see that I have been raving on about it for such a long time. There is a lot in this movie, but on top of that it is also very entertaining. I simply love Robocop.
