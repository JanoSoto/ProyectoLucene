[{"date":"30 April 2010","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" In its scenarios and each and every one of its ensemble of colorfully introduced, pitch-perfect characters, Election is a distillation of US culture and politics. For instance, there is a cleverly subversive scene where schoolteacher Jim McAllister asks school football star Paul what his favorite fruit is. Paul says, Pears. No wait! Apples. Mr. McAllister then proceeds, Great, now say that everyday you had an apple. An apple, an apple and more apples. You probably thought that apples were pretty good, even if you got a rotten one every once in awhile. Then one day there was an orange. Now you can choose, do you want an apple or do you want an orange? That's democracy. Paul then delivers the key line, I also like bananas. Indeed, every line is key. In some sense or another, they are all satirical punch lines. Each character narrates, so what we get are indeed apples and oranges. In their own unique ways, they let us know their take on each turning point that concerns them. Then when they all converge, like in a campaign rally scene in the school gym, we are aware of all contexts and perspectives, and what gets a reaction out of the student body and what leaves them quiet and bored hits several satirical bull's eyes at once.We recall classmates like Tracy Flick, the egghead who invariably has her hand in the air, while the teacher hopelessly scans for someone else to call on. She's one character in Alexander Payne's Election, an expert send-up about an election for student government president, a post Tracy craves to conquer to go along with her accumulation of every other prize in school. Tracy is played by Reese Witherspoon, who gave the seminal performance of her career in Election as a driven, calculating climber who tells Mr. McAllister she hopes they can collaborate harmoniously in the next school year.Jim McAllister's subsequent deception is the ironic and catastrophic truth that stands as the metaphor for contemporary US politics. He is in charge of organizing the student government, and begrudges Tracy for personal reasons, so he puppeteers the dim-witted, polite and hugely popular jock Paul, who can't play football this year, by pitting him against Tracy to draw out her vindictiveness. McAllister is played by Matthew Broderick, who narrates the film in a pitch tempered between awe and revulsion, and his performance is great in the sense of maintaining that equilibrium. Paul is played by Chris Klein in what might be his only truly good performance. Instead of a sweet walk-on hunk in a shallow teen movie, Payne exercises all of those qualities in him, the result being that he is perfect for the role.Perhaps my favorite character is Paul's sister, Tammy, the kind of student who is so completely her own person, so wise beyond her years, practically invisible in the shallow haze of Midwestern social mores, but that's no bother to her. She is dumped by her lover, classmate Lisa, who says that she is straight and was just experimenting. Lisa turns around to suddenly be Paul's new girlfriend and campaign manager, mostly to hurt Tammy. In response, Tammy runs for president too, with a platform that student government is all b.s. During the school assembly to hear their speeches, after Tracy merely gains a golf clap and Paul gets a strong reaction simply for his quarterback stardom, Tammy effortlessly voices an audacious speech reproaching the election and that she will get rid of the student government if elected. Thunderous standing ovation, followed by a total hair-pin turn in the story.Few commercially successful independent filmmakers of the 1990s cared as much about the incisive political realities of the Midwestern United States as Alexander Payne. Payne is a satirical filmmaker who doesn't take basic aim and bombard it. He stations in the center of his story and ambushes on all sides. Election is by no means just about a scandalous student. It's also about a weak teacher, inflexible authority, and a student body that is predominantly just coasting along until it can go out into the world and overrun useful room. The movie is not nasty about any of its characters. I kind of liked everybody some of the time (loved Tammy!), and even felt a little sorry for each one. Payne doesn't take pleasure in scapegoats and derision. What he's shooting for is an allegory for elections overall, in which the voters have to pick between the sorts of people who have been running for office ever since high school.

She is the type that adults sometimes refer to as Too smart for her own good. If you have heard of extreme sports, well, Enid is a master of extreme alienation. Just about everything and everybody is a target for her scorn. We get a taste of her acid tongue early on--after her graduation ceremony where a young girl, who has been the victim of a tragic auto accident, has given a banal speech (High School is like the training wheels for real life) Enid says to her friend Rebecca, I liked her so much better when she was an alcoholic crack addict. Enid has made it through high school, as many outsiders do, by having a close friend who shares her world view. Neither Enid nor Rebecca plans on going to college and the movie concentrates on what happens when such a pair is thrust into the real world.As Enid, Thora Birch has been well chosen for the part. She has all the facial expressions needed to portray disdain, dismay, confusion, and sadness. In a role that is not as demanding, Scarlett Johansson plays the person of the pair who is headed for a more normal life inside the ropes. Enid gets involved in a relationship with Seymour (Steve Buscemi) who, as is noted, is everything that Enid does not hate. Seymour is a collector of old 78 records and when Enid expresses amazement at the 1500 records in his collection he remarks that he has winnowed it down to the essentials. This exemplifies the droll humor that is evidenced throughout. I can't recall another film that deals with a person like Enid who is being forced to try to come to terms with her nonconformist personality in order to survive. She does mature during the course of the movie as seen by her realizing that a permanent relationship with Seymour will not work. The ending is ambiguous and we are left wondering what is to become of Enid. It would be interesting to drop in on her when she is in her 40s. I like to think that she would be running a small art gallery in Santa Fe, but that is if she has avoided suicide.The opening credits are about the most interesting I have seen. For one thing they illustrate how movies can do some things far more effectively than the written word. As the camera pans along looking through apartment windows (and ultimately landing on Enid's) enough information is provided about the contents of the apartments and the people living in them that would require twenty pages of description. But, the thing that really captured my attention was the inter-cutting of a Bollywood dance clip from the movie Gumnaam. This clip features the song Jaan Pehechaan Ho performed by Mohammed Rafi and it is so unusual that I was left saying to myself, Where in the hell did that come from? After my initial viewing of Ghost World, I was so fascinated by the dance number it that I bought Gumnaam just so I could have the full clip--a clip that is now an extra on the Ghost World DVD. This clip fits into the opening credits by way of Enid's watching it on TV and dancing to it in her apartment room; it shows an unfettered side of Enid that we don't see much of in the rest of the film.If you are a bit of an outsider, then this movie should be particularly appealing; if you are not, then it should give you an insight into such people.

I had rented it probably as soon as it came out on VHS. I hadn't read a Spawn comic but knew one thing, he was a badass and a lot of people liked the comics. I had high hopes. Boy, was I disappointed. Now as the time has passed and I've gotten older, I've tried to like it for different reasons. For the campy aspect of it, for Leguizamo's part, for anything...I still don't.The effects are what they are, and you can't do much with a budget too low for your aspirations when it comes to a work like this.

His fear was the typical Hollywood reactionary type that I've seen in a bunch of movies.(2) A scene with a now loony, buffed-up Sarah Connor (reprised by Linda Hamilton) in an insane asylum where the police psychiatrist from T1 now works (convenient) as he briefs a group of interns on her and then an utterly predictable and tepid exchange ONLY for explanation and exposition...BORING!(3) ANOTHER expository scene introducing 10-year old John Connor (a fetus at the end of T1), establishing him as a juvenile delinquent and showing how his foster folks are jerks We also get introduced to a new, improved evil Terminator, the liquid-metal T1000, played by Robert Patrick whose job it is to terminate John Connor; he can assume any human form and kills and takes the place of a cop (convenient plot device for the rest of the movie)I don't see how a movie with such a tedious introductory 30 minutes can be proclaimed the greatest ANYTHING of all time! And the rest of the film is filled with nothing but cliché dialog that is still sadly heard today in many action films (I guess T2 is influential in that sense).Schwarzenegger and Hamilton in T2 aren't given near as much to work with and not allowed to display the depth and range of emotions that permeated throughout T1, making it a provocative film and not JUST an action movie. The dialog in T1 had a realistic edge to it, ranging from Reese's hypnotic rants about the apocalypse and the T800's determination to kill Sarah to the gritty, wry (and convincing!) banter at the police station. Arnie in particular is stuck actually in a very thankless role, playing lapdog to John Connor (played by Edward Furlong, who gets to deliver an amazing amount of forgettable dialog). I saw nothing that would make me think this kid would be the future resistance leader and no mother-son chemistry between Furlong and Hamilton.For me, the biggest reason why T2 is not in the league of T1 is the evil Terminator himself. In no way, shape, or form, does Robert Patrick's T1000 match or come close to Arnie's no-nonsense, unflappable T800! I've seen some people complain that Patrick is not on screen enough. But guess what? Arnie probably had about the same (maybe even less) screen time in T1 than Patrick did in this movie and Schwarzenegger managed to be 100% convincing and frightening every second he was on screen in T1. To be fair, Patrick was confined by the conventions of what is really a generic action movie.Another big reason T2 is a fail for me is that (contrary to popular opinion!) it violates all that was built up in T1. Now, all of a sudden TWO (one in 84 and one in 94) evil Terminators were sent back. So there was a backup plan all along! Kind of takes the sting out of what Reese went through to save Sarah and ensure the future in T1, doesn't it?! T2 is rather long, also, with quite a few, expository, unnecessary scenes that seem to be designed to give it depth and to stretch the film out to the appropriate length of a big, summer blockbuster movie. Example would be a scene past the midway point where Sarah narrates (while she looks at them) how the good T800 is like perfect father to John of all the fathers he's had; the narration doesn't work and the whole scene doesn't work. What's ironic is that in T1, the human Reese was just as willing to sacrifice others to save Sarah as the T800 was in order to kill her, while in T2, Reese's replacement, who is not human, is sanitized to the point of not even seeming like a machine most of the time b\/c young John won't allow him to kill; I guess it's a message about morality even in war, but not delivered as effectively (due to stilted dialog and unbelievable scenes) as the win at all costs attitude of T1.In fairness, even though dated in terms of 80s, even people that love T1 (I do!) don't hold that against it and defend it for it's deep story, strong characterizations, brisk pace, nightmarish-noir look, and influence on the sci-fi genre. Even people that like T2 more than T1 (I do not!) compliment the original on these same things, so that's something.I understand why T2 is held in regard in terms of special effects. For a near 20-year old movie, the effects are still impressive, especially the smooth transitions in Patrick's T1000 going from metal to human form and back. CGI movies today could learn a thing or two from this film. Also, all the action scenes in this movie are necessary, if a bit showy. The action in T2 is well executed, if a bit too clean (minimal blood, no guts). But in between the few big, well done action scenes, there's standard dialog, boring character interactions, and predictable outcomes. None of this was true of T1!

Of course the strange noises and doings in that house eventually creep him out. Buono's scenes are all with Davis and with the scene stealing Marjorie Bennett who's kind of a mirror image of Baby Jane Hudson as Buono's inebriated mother. Just holding his own with these two I'm figuring the Academy figured Buono deserved some recognition.Bette and Joan, both were destined to be trapped in mediocrity for the most part in roles well beneath their talents. Bette to her credit did escape with such things as an Agatha Christie mystery occasionally and The Whales Of August. But mostly she and Joan did horror flicks because of the impression that Whatever Happened To Baby Jane left on the minds of the movie-going public. Both also got unceremoniously dissed by their daughters in memoirs, Bette not having the decency to die before B.D. Hyman's book came out.Whatever Happened To Baby Jane as repulsively fascinating as it is is a testament to two screen legends and the stamina of director Robert Aldrich who got them to share the screen.

There's a breed of raw and bold storytelling at work here that's been worn down by the burden of ridiculous budgets and the pull of the lowest common denominator in modern Hollywood. This tale of cops, robbers and the Mob pulses with a sizzling racial undertone and hammers at you with the blunt realities of working poverty. This kind of film-making wants the audience to think AND feel while most other films try and fail at only one or the other.The movie begins across 110th street, the border separating Harlem from the rest of New York. A couple of white Mafiosos have come to count up and collect the Mob's cut of the money from the black-run rackets that still have to operate under La Cosa Nostra's thumb. When two black police officers show up outside the apartment where the money is being counted, the first thought is to pay them off. Then one of the cops pulls out a machine and everyone knows it's a robbery. Things go wrong and the two mobsters, three black gangsters and two cops end up dead, while the two robbers and their getaway driver barely managed to escape with $300,000 of Mafia money.Both sides of the law then set out to track down the robbers. Nick D'Salvio (Anthony Franciosa), the son-in-law of the Don, is tasked with getting the money back and killing the men who took it. Nick's an insecure, desperate little man who's been his father-in-law's errand boy and grabs onto this job as his last chance to be a real made man. Police Captain Frank Mattelli (Anthony Quinn) has been the face justice for good and bad in Harlem for years, ruling over it more like a medieval county sheriff than a 20th century cop. But on this case, Mattelli has to play second fiddle to the black lieutenant that the powers-that-be put in charge of the investigation. Lieutenant William Pope (Yaphet Kotto) is as uncompromising and unyielding as Mattelli. He won't abide the older policeman's brutality and paternalistic, patronizing racism but does come to respect Matteli's ability and commitment as a cop.The chase between the good guys and the really bad guys to find the three robbers starts with the getaway driver. Henry J. Jackson (Antonio Fargas) is the sort of pimped out fool who struts around in rainbow-hued threads that look like they cost more than six months rent on his toilet bowl of an apartment. From there the search leads to Joe Logart (Ed Bernard), a guy who works in a laundromat and slowly comes to realize just how far down the road to Hell he's traveled. Finally, police and Mafia converge on Jim Harris (Paul Benjamin), a 42 year old epileptic who can't get a job better than superintendent of a slum lord's tenement. Jim is a hard man staring down the downslope of his life, deciding that rich or dead are the only choices for him.Across 110th Street is a starkly violent film. It might not seem that graphic in the age of Hostel and Saw, but there's a rough and chaotic edge to its moments of force and pain. The scenes of brutality in this movie are meant to shock, not startle or titillate. When bullets or punches fly and blood is shed, there's no sign of any practiced choreography. And the violence also follows two dramatic themes. First, there's the thuggish acts of Mattelli contrasted with the strong but civilized order that Pope insists be followed. Then there's the vicious but directed cruelty of the gangsters of both colors contrasted with the anarchic power of Jim Harris and his machine gun. In both cases an established code of savagery is confronted by a harbinger of the future.Another other fascinating aspect of this film is how it presents the changing racial order of 1970s America through both the police and the Mob. Mattelli is a 55 year old cop being pushed aside for the young black lieutenant and his rage against it is replaced by resignation. The Mafia is paranoid about maintaining its control over the black syndicates of Harlem while the black gangsters seethe at the white mobsters they have to tolerate but don't need. And the script smartly flips the black vs. white dynamic with Mattelli being the more effective cop than Pope, but the black gangsters proving themselves smarter and more capable than their Mafia superiors.Race isn't the only aspect of life at work in this film. The grinding existence of the working poor is also splashed all throughout the story. The squalor the three robbers live in tell you all you need to know about why they do they things the do.There's some nice, naturalistic acting on display here, particularly from Anthony Quinn and Paul Benjamin. Again, they play characters that mirror each other. Mattelli and Jim Harris are both strong, tough men who see nothing but decline in front of them. Mattelli, though, is too morally compromised to do anything about it while Harris still has the strength of will to try and be the master of his own fate. Yaphet Kotto gives an energetic performance, but he's playing more of a symbol than a human being.Across 110th Street is a powerful and somewhat sprawling work of entertainment. You should definitely give it a look.

The trailers for Dinosaur showed the first seven minutes or so of the movie, where we saw first-class, revolutionary animation of CGI dinosaurs superimposed against real backgrounds and the blending was seamless. These dinosaurs looked just as good as the beasts that wowed us in Jurassic Park. What's more, they acted like real dinosaurs. They didn't speak or behave like human beings covered with scales at all. Added with a majestic score by the great James Newton Howard, the trailer had me excited. I'd had my fill of talking dinosaurs with The Land Before Time and its excessive sequels; I wanted to see real dinosaurs without people in the foreground. That would have been a dream come true for a young dinosaur-lover like me.And Disney was originally going to give me that dream. That's right, folks, the first seven minutes of Dinosaur was originally going to set the mood for the entire picture. The dinosaurs would act like dinosaurs and not like people; it would be like a feature-length version of the Rite of Spring sequence from Disney's 1940 masterpiece Fantasia. But a Mr. Michael Eisner of Disney insisted on changing this all and revamping this concept for a real winner into basically just a retread of The Land Before Time with CGI instead of hand-drawn animation. Mr. Eisner ought to be ashamed of himself, because instead of getting this wondrous spectacle that the trailers and the first seven minutes of the movie promised us, we got just a generic family movie special only in its animation, but destined to be forgotten outside of the special effects department.I suppose Mr. Eisner's reasoning was that kids could not follow a story about dinosaurs without a) people or b) dinosaurs that act like people. Well, to him, I say your reasoning is backward. I was a kid at the time and I was disappointed to hear that the dinosaurs were going to start acting like people after the opening sequence. I would have been okay with narration; heck, I would have been okay if the lemurs in the movie voiced by Ossie Davis, Alfre Woodard, Max Casella, and Hayden Panettiere talked. But why the dinosaurs? What's more, even if they were to talk, why did they have to have such humanlike qualities? They have conversations, morals, love interests, and even philosophies. Oh, and some species of dinosaurs keep other dinosaurs for pets, too. The romantic subplot between two dinosaurs in the movie is completely wooden, generic, and worst of all, boring. That's a real disappointment for me because these dinosaurs are animated via some of the most impressive CGI I have ever seen. Like Roger Ebert noted in his spot-on review for the picture, the filmmakers spent a lot of effort making these dinosaurs look real, but spent more effort undermining that illusion. The only dinosaurs that do thankfully carry the illusion through are the carnivorous dinosaurs, who only snarl and roar and don't appear to have any morality or philosophy. And besides, did Pinocchio have a love interest? No? Then why should a dinosaur?But enough of me bashing what doesn't work. Now I will tell you this despite all of my complaints and suggestions (ones that would have made this a great picture instead of a good one), the movie does, I repeat, *does* entertain. It's a most adequate family picture that is sure to wow and amaze its many-aged audience members with its wonderful animation, strong voice acting, and dazzling moments of energetic action. I also appreciate that for the snarling antagonist, they chose a carnotaurus as opposed to the typical tyrannosaurus or allosaur. It's refreshing to see a new dinosaurs here and there. But why, oh, why, Disney, did you have to go and throw away such a brilliant idea for a more generic and forgettable one? The first seven minutes of Dinosaurs are absolutely wonderful. Before the dinosaurs talk, when they act like dinosaurs, when we see the real wonder and viciousness of that strange prehistoric time, the movie scores with absolute brilliance. But save for the animation, what follows is rather generic. Oh, there I go again....I like Dinosaur but I really feel that it is a missed opportunity. A colossal one. This was my reaction when I first saw in the movie at the age of nine in 2000. Now seeing it again for the first time in years, my reaction is exactly the same. The people running the company once owned by the brilliant Walt Disney ought to reflect upon his genius and his ideas and his masterpieces. If they had done this (as they had wanted to before Mr. Michael Eisner stepped in) Dinosaur would have been a great movie, one destined to be remembered like the Rite of Spring sequence in Fantasia that its opening so reminds us of. But beyond that opening sequence, there is nothing that isn't well, like the dinosaurs themselves, fossilized.

","genre":"Animation, Adventure, Family"},{"date":"30 April 2010","score":"","review":" I came across this old film in the bargain bin at my local pound store and couldn't believe I hadn't heard of it before&#x85;OK, only kidding. Let's face it you'd have had to have spent your entire life living in a hermetically sealed bubble to not know about Orson Welles' debut film, which is almost universally hailed as the greatest movie of all time. It's an interesting &#x96; and divisive &#x96; title for any film to be saddled with, that World's Greatest Movie tag. Imagine being branded something as modest as the world's greatest commis chef, or world's greatest dishwasher, and see how quickly people would start trying to bring you down from your lofty perch. There seems to be a lot of people wanting to know what's so great about Kane, mostly because every groundbreaking film-making technique generally &#x96; and to a degree, mistakenly &#x96; attributed to Kane, now forms the core of every film school's Big Book of Movie-Making, thereby blunting Kane's once industry-changing impact. The film deserves recognition because of its place in history, no doubt about it. But is it any good? Well, yes, actually. Citizen Kane provides the audience with an intelligent, insightful and sophisticated character study of an egotistical megalomaniac and delivers, in almost every shot, something meaningful that contributes to our understanding of Kane. A rich vein of irony runs through the film. For example, the photograph in the opening newsreel of Kane with his son and smiling wife below the newspaper headline announcing his nomination for Senator is taken the moment before his wife reveals to him she knows about his mistress. Kane's political aspirations die within an hour of that jubilant photograph being taken. Welles doesn't bother to point that out, crediting the audience with enough intelligence to not require a guiding hand.I doubt whether any Hollywood film prior to this one had penetrated so deep or so vividly beneath the surface of its character. As the film progresses, Kane's material wealth grows in direct correlation to the loss of his personal relationships, until he is alone in a vast, monolithic castle on a hill.

These films were the highlights of his career and even though he isn't as memorable as Will Dormer in Insomnia, it is hard not to give him an honorable mention. Insomnia is referred to as a Cat and Mouse thriller and it proved that it is one because of the whole chase thing between Will Dormer, a cop, and a local writer who goes by the name of Walter Finch, a man who is under the suspicion of killing a teen. This is proved even more when there is an actual ground chase between them two on the logs in the flowing river. That scene was full of heart pounding action and added a bit of intrigue that made you appreciate the film a little bit more. The film would have been unknown to me if there weren't the three Oscar winners, Al Pacino, Robin Williams, and Hilary Swank that made this thriller for what it is, also if Christopher Nolan hadn't directed it. He is truly a great director. Steven Spielberg has to watch out for the might of Nolan. Al Pacino was absolute and admirable in Insomnia therefore making him the best actor in the whole film. His role as a tough cop was fascinating and hypnotizing. Robin Williams, who portrays Walter Finch, was not as great as Al's however he still doesn't disappoint. This is not Robin Williams best role but it MIGHT be his most evilest role in his Evil Trilogy.

","genre":"Comedy, Drama"},{"date":"30 April 2010","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" GoldenEye was James Bond's return after his then longest time away from the silver screen, a 1995 film brought to life by New Zealand born director Martin Campbell who, as with 2006's Casino Royale, invigorated the franchise from one thing to another; in that particular case daft actioner into something with soul and feeling; but here Bond is brought out of the slump infused by studio based problems which blighted 1989's Licence to Kill, a film which, despite being perfectly functionable, always felt like a globe-trotting revenge infused narcotics thriller than anything else, and back into a character whose life is persistently revolving around espionage and political intrigue. In short, it sits along side the aforementioned Casino Royale as being one of the better James Bond entries of the last twenty-plus years or so.GoldenEye's pre-credit sequence is an announcing bearer of new order, a back to basics espionage infused sequence that sees old fashioned infiltration of a Soviet base by James Bond and fellow agent Alec Trevelyan (Bean), who actually gets the jump on Bond in a storage room in what is an early example demonstrating a feint sense of superiority he has over him. Set prior to The Cold War's closure, and with an eye on the fact the film was the first Bond entry since, Campbell systematically introduces The Cold War as an item that requires dealing with before rounding off Bond's relation to it. The film will come to meld burning clandestinity with the more contemporary action genre, and if the majority of previous Bond entries revolved around that fear of both nuclear war and Soviet retribution set during the Cold War era; then GoldenEye, by way of a certain Soviet character in this piece, detaches the series from these binds during the climax to a particular gunfight on a train about half way through. To exclaim precisely what happens would spoil the feature but needless to say, the removing of a villain and substituting him for another signals a 'passing over' of a particular guard; both in terms of the world within GoldenEye as the film veers more towards action orientated escapism and for the series as a whole - something that saw the franchise require villains like Western, media-infused billionaires and those from nations such as North Korea.It is Pierce Brosnan playing the famous agent, his first of four incarnations although probably not his best turn when compared to The World is Not Enough; although the necessary emotional weight is rather effectively pulled off when it transpires he's going up against a former comrade and needs to take that on board. He very nearly gets to utter the immortal line of announcing the character's name at the exact same locale as Connery did in his and the series' first whilst sitting at a card game; although by the time he does so, he's got up and moved a few feet away. Throughout, there are numerous references and acknowledgments to wartime years of old; sarcastic but somewhat enjoyable without ever being overly cynical jabs at secret agent clichés and techniques of old &#x96; my favourite of which sees Bond interact with an American named Jack Wade (Baker), a sort of Felix Leiter substitute, and their exchange ought to see them swap codes in the form of odd sentences but the notion is initially dismissed before being executed in a drawn out manner, thus brining attention to itself. GoldenEye seems to know where it stands; its early scene in which an enemy higher-up named Ourumov (John) demands Bond come out with (his) hands up is poked fun at by Bond as being somewhat clichéd; as if Bond knows where he is and that villainous demands such as these are what they are.Ourumov is involved with a mysterious, villainous individual linked to a Russian crime syndicate; although it will later transpire they have more in common with one another in the sense they're grotesque traitors to their states. Their plan revolves around the titular GoldenEye , a satellite orientated weapon of mass destruction unless a ransom is paid; something that is rather a little overly overt by the time it arrives for a piece whose first two thirds are a cracking ride of all sorts. Bond's ally in missile base technician Natalya Simonova (Scorupco) is both well observed and constructed; her beginnings seeing her survive a massacre at her military base as she takes cover in the a locales that suggest the ultimate in domseticisation the kitchen. This is before branching out into a strong female character without ever really undergoing trangresification, nor being 'punished' by the film for adopting these traits. The film allows Natalya to take control of certain situations, asserting herself, and shows ingenuity in making a discovery that Bond otherwise wouldn't have been able to do so in furthering the cause. In handing Bond a female accomplice, the film is only too pleased to do the same to the enemy; a female mercenary who goes by the name of Xenia Onatopp (Janssen), her bright red sports car with her loose and erratic driving plus flirtatious glance at the beginning only adding to the overall aura of danger we come to learn she carries. It turns out blending pleasure with pain with business is nary too far away from the woman's agenda.

In short, it sits along side the aforementioned Casino Royale as being one of the better James Bond entries of the last twenty-plus years or so.GoldenEye's pre-credit sequence is an announcing bearer of new order, a back to basics espionage infused sequence that sees old fashioned infiltration of a Soviet base by James Bond and fellow agent Alec Trevelyan (Bean), who actually gets the jump on Bond in a storage room in what is an early example demonstrating a feint sense of superiority he has over him. Set prior to The Cold War's closure, and with an eye on the fact the film was the first Bond entry since, Campbell systematically introduces The Cold War as an item that requires dealing with before rounding off Bond's relation to it. The film will come to meld burning clandestinity with the more contemporary action genre, and if the majority of previous Bond entries revolved around that fear of both nuclear war and Soviet retribution set during the Cold War era; then GoldenEye, by way of a certain Soviet character in this piece, detaches the series from these binds during the climax to a particular gunfight on a train about half way through. To exclaim precisely what happens would spoil the feature but needless to say, the removing of a villain and substituting him for another signals a 'passing over' of a particular guard; both in terms of the world within GoldenEye as the film veers more towards action orientated escapism and for the series as a whole - something that saw the franchise require villains like Western, media-infused billionaires and those from nations such as North Korea.It is Pierce Brosnan playing the famous agent, his first of four incarnations although probably not his best turn when compared to The World is Not Enough; although the necessary emotional weight is rather effectively pulled off when it transpires he's going up against a former comrade and needs to take that on board. He very nearly gets to utter the immortal line of announcing the character's name at the exact same locale as Connery did in his and the series' first whilst sitting at a card game; although by the time he does so, he's got up and moved a few feet away. Throughout, there are numerous references and acknowledgments to wartime years of old; sarcastic but somewhat enjoyable without ever being overly cynical jabs at secret agent clichés and techniques of old &#x96; my favourite of which sees Bond interact with an American named Jack Wade (Baker), a sort of Felix Leiter substitute, and their exchange ought to see them swap codes in the form of odd sentences but the notion is initially dismissed before being executed in a drawn out manner, thus brining attention to itself. GoldenEye seems to know where it stands; its early scene in which an enemy higher-up named Ourumov (John) demands Bond come out with (his) hands up is poked fun at by Bond as being somewhat clichéd; as if Bond knows where he is and that villainous demands such as these are what they are.Ourumov is involved with a mysterious, villainous individual linked to a Russian crime syndicate; although it will later transpire they have more in common with one another in the sense they're grotesque traitors to their states. Their plan revolves around the titular GoldenEye , a satellite orientated weapon of mass destruction unless a ransom is paid; something that is rather a little overly overt by the time it arrives for a piece whose first two thirds are a cracking ride of all sorts. Bond's ally in missile base technician Natalya Simonova (Scorupco) is both well observed and constructed; her beginnings seeing her survive a massacre at her military base as she takes cover in the a locales that suggest the ultimate in domseticisation the kitchen. This is before branching out into a strong female character without ever really undergoing trangresification, nor being 'punished' by the film for adopting these traits. The film allows Natalya to take control of certain situations, asserting herself, and shows ingenuity in making a discovery that Bond otherwise wouldn't have been able to do so in furthering the cause. In handing Bond a female accomplice, the film is only too pleased to do the same to the enemy; a female mercenary who goes by the name of Xenia Onatopp (Janssen), her bright red sports car with her loose and erratic driving plus flirtatious glance at the beginning only adding to the overall aura of danger we come to learn she carries.

That is, as long as the story calls for it. But in the case of The Third Man, the tempo is nothing but dull.I imagine that the big reveal of Harry Lime, played by Orson Welles, still being alive might have been shocking when the movie was released in 1949. Kind of like Kevin Spacey being the killer in Seven, receiving no credit on posters or in the title sequence in order to preserve the mystery. Today, one would be hard pressed to find someone who doesn't know that Spacey's in Seven. This brings me back to The Third Man. Before seeing the movie I knew absolutely nothing about it, except it being voted one of the best British films ever, and that Orson Welles plays a character called Harry Lime (his face is on the cover for chrissake!), a fact which has been hard to avoid as it's regularly on lists of great performances. Consequently, I spent most of the film waiting for him to appear. No great mystery left, in other words.The acting is symptomatic of its time, so I can't really complain about it not being naturalistic. It's just something you have to accept when watching movies from this time period. Although I have to say I love the scene in the ferris wheel. Welles does a great job there.Although some people might love it, I'm just really annoyed that the movie refuses to decide which genre it's in. Is it a comedy? Is it a thriller? There are instances where combined genres work beautifully, but The Third Man is not one of those cases. The problem with The Third Man's genre schizophrenia is that the comedy parts aren't that funny, and the thriller parts aren't very thrilling, resulting in a bland mess.The thriller part is messed up even more by the ever annoying zither soundtrack. I can think of only one other case where the soundtrack almost singlehandedly messes up a movie, and that's Serpico. In the case of Serpico the director Sidney Lumet boasted that there was only about 10 minutes or so of music (I can't remember the exact number, but he says it in the special features on the DVD) in the entire 2+ hour film. All I could think about when watching it was that it was 10 minutes we could have done without that awful Mikis Theodorakis crap.Back to The Third Man, Anton Karas' plinky plunky zither bonanza plays almost nonstop throughout the entire picture. It sways between being vomit inducingly melodramatic and something out of a zany Tom & Jerry cartoon comedy, effectively removing any tension that might have been left in the movie.The behind the scenes documentary on the DVD was far more interesting and engaging than the movie itself, and is the only reason for me not chucking the movie into the waste basket.

This film takes that impression one step further, making literal what is ordinarily only figurative. In this case, the hapless suitor (Greg Focker, played by Ben Stiller) is to be probed and dissected by an ex-CIA man, who has years of experience and all the tools of the trade at his disposal, including contacts at the Agency. To say that Jack Byrnes (Robert de Niro) is an overprotective father is like saying that Krakatoa was an explosion.

Greg strives gamely to win them over, but everything he does backfires, or at least fizzles.I have only one minor criticism.

The idea behind the film was amazing and probably sounded pretty flash at an ideas meeting at the studio.

The crazy mutant like Penguin and the power crazy megalomaniac in waiting Max Shreck. But wait, just who is this women dressed up like a cat? Friend or Foe? Seems the Dark Knight has a lot on his hands this Christmas.In 1989 director Tim Burton rekindled the super hero genre for Warner Brothers with his take on Batman. Made for $35 million, recouping over that in its opening weekend, the film went on to make a Worldwide profit of over $375 million. The sequel of course was inevitable, as was the return of Burton, even if he dallied around trying to bluff that he would only return if a script was fresh and exciting. Sure enough, and with Burton getting the script he wanted from Daniel Waters, Batman Returns turned over a profit of over $185 million. Thus ensuring that further franchise instalments were to follow, even if, as it turned out, Burton didn't.Batman Returns is more breezy than its predecessor, not in humour terms, but in action. In fact for a genre so steeped in sense of humour, Returns is surprisingly devoid of comedy. A charge of both Burton & Waters taking things a little too seriously is hard to argue against. But that's not to decry the good things that run abound in the film. Burton's trademark Gothics exist all told, and it has its darkness, both in themes and in actual visuals. All of course accompanied by a whirling Danny Elfman score. But what of the story itself? Well this perhaps would have been better served as being titled something along the lines of The Penguin Cometh, for make no fish bones about it, this is the Penguin movie. Batman and Catwoman are in essence just playing henchman and henchwoman, with Max Shrek serving only as plot device that's saying the real villains of our world don't wear masks or costumes. A bold move by Burton to have the Penguin as the lead protagonist, one that financially paid off. But one that ultimately turned many away from revisits for its perceived un-family friendly being. Guilty as charged said Burton, it's his vision and he stands by it. Thus Batman Returns stands up as the most adult of the four Batman movies made in the modern wave from 1989 to 1997. Quite a feat when you consider the film is set during the bastion of all family holidays! Sadly what was to follow would be kiddie friendly fodder served up by Joel Schumacher-reaching a crushing and chronic nadir with Batman & Robin.The cast are mostly excellent, Keaton does what he can in what is ultimately now a cog in a big wheel role. While Max Shreck gets to play Christopher Walken with relish and oratory menace (yes I did it on purpose). However, it's with Michell Pfeiffer's Catwoman & Danny Devito's Penguin that the film reaches its acting heights. Pfeiffer plays it mousey for Selina Kyle and then leaps at the chance to vamp it up as the delicious Catwoman. With a sultry miaow here and a tippy tappy skip there, this Cat is all in one sexy and very dangerous, something poor Bats is going to have to contend with. But it's DeVito's show all the way. Charged with having to follow Jack Nicholson's film stealing turn from the first film, DeVito immerses himself in the role of the pathetic, deformed, yet dangerously criminal Penguin. It's a monstrous creation fit to grace any modern day horror movie, with DeVito's physicality proving a necessity for the mutant flippered one who was raised in the sewers. If only Danny had been given more opportunities like this to show his talent.There's many missteps in here too tho. Burton is no master of directing action, and some of the one liners shoe-horned in are poor and pointless. While the whole birth of Catwoman story arc just isn't explained in any way. In fact it's all a bit lazy in truth. Burton tho remains a film maker with his own visual flair, his layering of atmosphere as Gotham is on the brink of collapse is expertly crafted. He has stuff to say and he's going to have fun saying said stuff. Often frustrating he can be for sure, but always he carries a uniqueness into many of his film's. Batman Returns is no different in that respect. 7\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"30 April 2010","score":"","review":" Having seen off the evil Joker, the Caped Crusader now has to deal with with two other deadly foes to keep Gotham City safe.

He made a remake that was actually a lot better than the original source material. Granted, he made his film in the 1980's when you could show a bit more blood and make a more effective looking monster, however this film from which that film spawned was a rather good movie in its own rights. John Carpenter must have enjoyed this film a lot himself as not only did he make a remake of it, but he also featured it prominently in another of his hits Halloween as one of the movies that came on during the horror movie marathon and it was the most recognizable. This film differs though from the remake in many ways. For starters, in the Carpenter version had no females in it at all. While this one has one. The alien had far different plans in both versions and was different in other ways too. It looked a lot better of course in Carpenter's version, because here it was just a sort of basic monster that kind of glowed. Still, while the later version is clearly better this one has its own charm. I loved that it was set in an arctic base, one of the reasons I enjoyed Carpenter's version as well. There is also something about the alien monster that has something sinister up its sleeve. Well I guess it was only doing what came naturally to it, but still it would spell trouble for the world. So a nice sci-fi\/horror combination that while it is not the film that would come later, I bet it will be better to the 2011 remake that is coming.
