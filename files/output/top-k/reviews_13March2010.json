The people who hated No Country for Old Men will hate this one too. Probably, this movie is the movie that is accepted as the most boring movie ever. It is not for everyone, but personally I did get bored at all. I was at high school when saw the movie for the first time. I had wondered it a lot and finally watched it and I remember, the time flied by. 2001 is quiet, still, beautiful and reposeful. It is pure space, pure science fiction. You know, Kubrick is a perfectionist director and sometimes, he does it, succeeds. 2001 is one of those movies. He gets the perfection. The movie has everything that can be in a science fiction film. He endeavors to catch every kind of picture in space and he does. That is one of the reasons that this is the greatest gift to science fiction lovers. Space has never looked that mysterious and beautiful at the same time. Really the music is very coherent with the visuals, so impressive. Visually, the movie is minimalist and very very stylish, no need to repeat that it is beautiful also. The set designs are great, the spacecraft which is sent to Jupiter is the best spacecraft I have ever seen in my life! Space has never looked that mysterious, unknown, obscure and creepy sometimes. For example, the scene that the astronauts come down to the ground first is creepy a bit. And just a note, I like the scenes they eat, visually colorful too. As for HAL, one of the most hypnotizing voices ever in cinema. Also as I see, it is the most intelligent artificial intelligent, computer ever and it makes the movie very interesting. A conscious existence. It is like a very very smart gentleman in dramas. The sequence which one of the astronauts goes in order to check and fix the problem with breath sounds is my favorite of the movie! One of the best sound editing ever. It is repeated by 2010, but unfortunately it seemed pretentious to me probably so that it is a repetition. By the way, I had not expected that things will come to that point. What a great script! In the second half, tension increases, but quietly. Not to spoil the movie, I won't tell who or what is it?, but there is a danger and it is more threatening than even the alien! The monologues of HAL, near the end left me with complex feelings somehow, but I hated it of course, it made me angry. The journey near the end, brilliant visuals, a space journey couldn't be defined better. That sequence is my second favorite. However, I learned that some people make fun of it by saying that it was like media player visualizations. The special effects look much better than even Avatar, you can bet on that! Just perfect. As for the final, I did not understand it exactly and honestly disappointed little, to me the weakest part of the movie, it could have been different, but no problem. I very enjoyed 2001, it is one of the movies that made me impressed the most.

It will revolutionize science. Since he's the leading expert in medical transplants a young black doctor Williams (Marshall) wishes to work with him and learn all he can. We soon see that Kirchner wants nothing to do with blacks and says he can't work there. Williams gave up a lot to go there and is mad, so Kirshner reluctantly allows him to work for a short time. Kirshner confides in his colleague Dr. Desmond that he is dying and must have body immediately. The word goes out, and a death row inmate decides to donate his body to medical science. Jack (Grier) claims he's innocent, but is brought over and put under for the procedure. In one of the funnier parts of the film Kirshner wakes up on a black mans body. They plan was to keep the other head sedated until Kirshner can control the body, but Jack makes a run for it, with Kirshner's head attached, taking Marshall hostage. In a chase that never seems to end Jack finally gets away from the cops and the brothers decide to get rid of the white mans head. One thing leads to another and Kirshner ends up with his head ready to be transplanted again while Jack, Marshal, and his girl take off for freedom. The End, what a stupid film. This has to be one of the dumbest films I have ever scene. Not only is it totally outlandish, everything else is bad as well. From the acting to the special affects its just bargain basement bad. With all that being said I watched the whole thing and was amused by most of the film. The effects are so bad you can't help but laugh, especially at Milland's head on Grier's body throughout much of the film as they run, ride and elude police. The effects are laughable, certainly Rick Baker went on to much better things. I guess this would be practice for future works with ape costumes, King Kong, Mighty Joe Young and Planet of the Apes (all remakes). And the story, Racist white guy gets his head put on black man's body? That's funny. This is your classic blaxploitation film with most of the white guys being shown as villains in the film, but just from a comedic angle. There are plenty of solid films of this nature but this is not one of them. This only serves to garner some stupid laughs from a stupid script. One of the worst parts of the film has to be the never ending chase. For what seems like and eternity Grier is chased by the cops on a dirt bike. But its goes on FOREVER! they must have spent half the budget on crashed police cars. Milland's a good actor so I'm surprised he did some of these low budget yarns, somewhat like Frogs. The rest of the cast did their job, Grier was amusing nothing bad to say just a silly film all together. So overall stupid film of the era, but so bad its good quality bumps it up bit, 2 and a half stars.

And, with the benefit of the commentary, I don't think there's a lot that I missed.I'm still wrestling with my reaction to the film. There was much in the film that was skillfully done and rewarding. Some moving and thought-provoking themes. Some superb camera work. Some fine performances. Some memorable sequences. A lot of good movie making.And yet, on the whole, I find myself dissatisfied. Because as expertly done as many aspects of the film are, there are others where it is simply dismal. Its structure is a fiasco. Its plot a jumbled mess. Events which are played very significantly turn out to have no significance at all, and merely peter out. Key events are simply left out of the story, leaving us to wonder what happened. The movie breaks up essentially into three sections which have little to do with each other.The problem is, the movie lacks a tight, coherent plot, and is more a sequence of somewhat related events. It's sloppy and all over the map. And it's easy to see why Renoir's inspiration for the film was a collection of war stories recollected to him by an officer he met after the war. And that's exactly how the movie comes off, as a hodge-podge of ideas and stories thrown together, without enough effort made to sculpt the thing into a cohesive whole. Heck, Renoir didn't even know how to end it or what to name it until the very end, underscoring the fact that even *he* wasn't quite sure what he was making. What ended up on the screen is apparently vastly different than the first draft of the screenplay, which didn't even have some of the key characters, and was supposed to be about the various escape exploits of the protagonist. By the time we're done, we get only one actual escape for our hero, plus minor participation in a stillborn attempt.So you can wax on all you want about the great care and detail that went into every scene and camera shot, about the messages and the themes, about the acting, the sets, whatever you want. And I agree that, in looking at the details, at looking at the movie in a reductionistic way, it's a beautiful work of art. But a movie is about more than its parts. It's also about how those parts fit together to make a whole. And looked at holistically, I'm sorry, La Grande Illusion is a disappointment.

A lot of people including myself have been critical of some of the films they have made and been criticised for dumbing down plots for simple profit.Brigadier General Francis Hummel (Ed Harris) is a highly respected special forces general, who ends up being disillusioned with the American Government, when they dismiss the deaths of special forces soldiers, and not give families the money or the respect they deserve. He takes up extreme action to achieve his goal with a special force team he steals a stockpile of VX from the US military and then takes hostiles on Alcatraz. Hummel threatens to fire the VX over San Francisco if his demands are not meant and the American government has limited options. The American government only option is to try and send in a special forces team, with a chemical weapons expert Stanley Goodspeed (Nicholas Cage) to disarm the weapons. The problem is that there is only one man who knows how to get into Alcatraz, John Mason (Sean Connery). The thing is, Mason was a former MI6 and SAS soldier, who was arrested by the American, and well unhappy of his arrest, and a now a man in his 60s.Some critics and film fans believe that The Rock is Michael Bay's best film, seeing it as simple summer entertain that is not being pretentious. I disagree, I believe that The Island and Transformers are better films. However the Rock is Michael Bay at his best and worst. There are very good action sequences, especially the military based action. He is not reliant on massive CGI sequence like he is in his later films. Bay could make a good film about special forces. Bay also shoots the film with the aim of an R-rating, and not playing it safe like he has done. Bay also ensembles a good cast, this was when Nicholas Cage was at the height of his career. Sean Connery is in one of his better roles outside Bond, though his part has to be Scottish because he can't do any other accent if his character was Russian it would have been a bit more believable. Ed Harris was the strongest performer in the film as a the villain, who was made to be a complex character who had a noble cause unlike some villains in summer blockbusters. Bay was also able to fill smaller roles with talented actors, like John Spencer, John C. McGinley and Michael Biehn. But there are a lot of problems that are common with Michael Bay films. Bay has no clue how to reign in his films and like Transformers, Armageddon, etc... The Rock is too long. Bay needs a good editor who can make his films more tort and well more watchable. With this sort of film where the plot is very simple then making it long really affects the film. Things could be have easily been cut, like the car chase in San Francisco. A problem with the film is tone. When the script is written it aimed to be very serious, whilst the re-writes and the direction by Bay wanted to make it more light hearted and comedic. This shows with the different performances, with Sean Connery and Nicholas Cage almost being like a buddy pair, whilst actors like Ed Harris and John Spencer were more serious in their roles. As well there are some script problems, where the film explains too much details to the audience, and not respecting their intelligence. The script also has plot holes, like wouldn't the media question why people were missing or couldn't get to Alcatraz.In a film like this I describe Michael Bay as Oliver Stone with more explosions. This is a film that references at some conspiracy theories and American secret actions, like the locking up of Mason. A more political director would have flagged this issues up more, but a more political director possibility wouldn't have done this film. The theories involving Hoover and the microfilm wasn't needed at all.There are enjoyable action scenes, but there are problems with this film.

Sean Connery is in one of his better roles outside Bond, though his part has to be Scottish because he can't do any other accent if his character was Russian it would have been a bit more believable. Ed Harris was the strongest performer in the film as a the villain, who was made to be a complex character who had a noble cause unlike some villains in summer blockbusters. Bay was also able to fill smaller roles with talented actors, like John Spencer, John C. McGinley and Michael Biehn. But there are a lot of problems that are common with Michael Bay films. Bay has no clue how to reign in his films and like Transformers, Armageddon, etc... The Rock is too long. Bay needs a good editor who can make his films more tort and well more watchable. With this sort of film where the plot is very simple then making it long really affects the film. Things could be have easily been cut, like the car chase in San Francisco. A problem with the film is tone. When the script is written it aimed to be very serious, whilst the re-writes and the direction by Bay wanted to make it more light hearted and comedic. This shows with the different performances, with Sean Connery and Nicholas Cage almost being like a buddy pair, whilst actors like Ed Harris and John Spencer were more serious in their roles. As well there are some script problems, where the film explains too much details to the audience, and not respecting their intelligence. The script also has plot holes, like wouldn't the media question why people were missing or couldn't get to Alcatraz.In a film like this I describe Michael Bay as Oliver Stone with more explosions. This is a film that references at some conspiracy theories and American secret actions, like the locking up of Mason. A more political director would have flagged this issues up more, but a more political director possibility wouldn't have done this film. The theories involving Hoover and the microfilm wasn't needed at all.There are enjoyable action scenes, but there are problems with this film.

The cover showed one of those forgettable everybody-stare-at-the-camera-and-try-to-look-cool images, and the title itself makes it seem like a forgettable pulp novel. The Claim. Wooooo. The only reason I bought it was because I'm a fan of Natassja Kinski.Well, Natassja didn't really have a leading role; instead the film focused mostly on Peter Mullan as Mr. Dillon, the wealthy, powerful owner of Kingdom Come, a small but promising town at the base of the Sierra Nevada mountains. Although there are several interesting subplots, the story is about him, and Mullan delivers an excellent performance. He is neither good nor evil but a believable human character who is caught up in his ambition....which leads me to the title of my review. I highly recommend you read the short poem Ozymandias by Percy Shelley before watching this film. The film itself uses it briefly in the beginning where a stage performer recites parts of it to an audience. This immediately piqued my interest, since Ozy is one of my favourite poems. As the story progressed, I realized that this injection was not trivial; the film is essentially built on the story of Ozymandias, and once you realize that, you'll be able to focus on the main theme.As I said, there are several sub-themes that are interwoven Milla Jovovich plays a great role of a singer who's not the marrying type (and by the way, she sings some great Portugese songs). Wes Bentley plays a young official for the railroad, sort of a play-by-the-rules boyscout type who is at odds with the subjective rules of the old west. Natassja is a woman slowly dying of consumption and haunted by a bitter past. Sarah Polley is her daughter, innocent and oblivious but learning quickly. They all deliver great performances with my only criticism being their accents which are a little too modern, but if you can overlook that, there's no problem.The director used some unusual techniques which caught my attention. For one thing, when switching to dream sequences, he didn't do the stereotypical sepia tint and harp plucking to announce hey we're going to a dream sequence. It may confuse you at first, but it keeps you on your toes.This film has a very epic feel to it, perhaps like Sergio Leone's classic Once Upon a Time in the West, and at just under 2 hours, the length and pacing seem right. But somehow I didn't quite get as much character development as I would've wanted. I suppose that's plain math... if we have 5 main characters, that gives each one only 24 minutes. Less if you consider that the main focus is on Mullan. But perhaps upon repeated viewings, you can get more of a story on each of them.One other criticism I have is that the musical score wasn't very dynamic. It seemed to repeat the same 2 sweeping chords over & over. Then silence. Then back to the same 2 chords. Repeat. But this is a minor criticism, and I doubt you would've even noticed it had I not said anything. Oopsie, sorry bout that. But like I said earlier, Milla's singing provides enough to impress us musically.Overall, it's a good film and a great interpretation of Ozymandias in the Old West (again I urge you to read the poem so you may find the same beauty in the film as I did). Also if you have a Blockbuster near you, check out the used pile where you can find this for $4. Definitely worth the price.

Soon after, when they are about to do a hit on a few college kids, Jackson asks one of them about the hamburger he is eating. He then uses the royale with cheese line on him, which leads to one of the funniest conversations in the history of movies.The Academy-Award nominated performance by Samuel L.

Whether you like hilarious comedies, violent action thrillers, or a deeply absorbing drama-you can enjoy it. The first time you watch it, don't try and think too much about it; just watch how the plot unfolds and everything comes together. Watch the funny conversations between Travolta and Jackson, the funky dance scene with Travolta and Thurman, and all of the other moments that make Pulp Fiction a truly memorable movie.http\/\/franklinreviews.blogspot.com\/ ","genre":"Crime, Drama"},{"date":"13 March 2010","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" No doubt that, technically speaking, Stanley Kubrick is maybe the greatest director of all time, he can create an atmosphere like no one else, but he tends to ruin his screenplays, like he did with A Clockwork Orange.

The finished product is disappointing, It begins in 17th century Massachussets (the third British colony in America, famous for its witch hunts) A hieratic is about to meet the noose for worshipping Satan. On the day he receives his sentence, the clouds come and take him away, off to 20th century California. A witch hunter seeking revenge for the murder of his wife follows the warlock (somehow) into the future, and using a witch compass proceeds to track him down.
