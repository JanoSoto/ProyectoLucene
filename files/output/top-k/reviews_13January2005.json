This is not a Roman slap stick, but a witty fun thrall.I was ESPECIALLY pleased with Alan Rickman's performance, who is one actor who has never let me down! He delivers his character with perfectly timed synchronicity, and suave appeal. Rickman is one actor who demands attention in every role, and this performance is no exception.The other performance which was especially appealing was that of Tony Shalhoub. I hope to see this swanky, sly spoken comedian in many more performances. I cannot think of another actor who could have pulled off his lackadaisical, laid appeal. Hilarious, thank you Tony! I can honestly say that this is one movie I can watch and watch, and watch, and it actually becomes more appealing each time. The jokes are layered, so you get something new each time you view it.

I went and bought the book, which was beautiful, and explained some of the mysteries not dealt with in the movie. As always, Hunter, the absolute best actor, was fantastic. Her role as the mute, Scottish woman Ada Wyston Mcgrath, whose one from of expression and release was her piano, was beautiful. A mute outcast, rejected from society in her home town, merely for being mute, only to be aggravated further by her having an illegitimate daughter Flora McGrath (Anna Paquins very first movie, also a brilliant actor). Flora being the result of a night of passion with her piano tutor. Not a most suitable and acceptable thing to do at the time. Her father, desperate for her to settle down with someone and become a respectable member of society, sends her to New Zealand for an arranged marriage. When she arrives her relationship with her new husband, Alisdair Stewart (Sam Neil), gets off to a rather terrible start. Having to leave her precious piano at the beach, she does everything possible to retrieve it, aggravating Alisdair, who, no matter how hard he tries cannot manage to fathom why the instrument is so important. His friend, George Baines (Harvey Keitel), however sees this, and uses it to his advantage. My personal favourite parts are the voice overs of Adas thoughts at the beginning and end of the movie. There is a silence where hath been no sound\/There is a silence where no sound may be\/In the cold grave under the deep, deep sea\/Or in wide desert where no life is found\/Which hath been mute, and still must sleep profound\/No voice is hushed, no life treads silently\/Though clouds and cloudy shadows wander free\/That never spoke over idle ground\/But in green ruins, in the desolate walls\/Of antique palaces, where man hath been\/Though the dun fox or wild hyena calls\/And owls that flit continually between\/Shreik to the echo and the low winds moan\/There the true silence is- self conscious and alone -Silence, Thomas Hood (1798-1845) ","genre":null},{"date":"13 January 2005","score":"4 out of 9 people found the following review useful","review":" Brilliant, beautiful, you have not lived until you see it.

I really enjoyed JULIA slipping into the role of the skinless seductor, previously held by her former lover Frank in the original. Several of the same cast & crew also return. The special effects by BOB KEEN is some of the best special effects work to ever grace a horror film! I really loved the character of Channard, he's so deliciously charismatic & evil, in fact along with him, Julia & Frank, one could almost consider it a crime, that neither of these villains ever turned up in future instalments. The scene where the mental patient razors himself on a bloody mattress is super gory, that it actually makes up for the lack of blood in the film. The film is imbued with marvellous, twisted & very weird visuals. The cenobites yet again serve only as mere window dressing to the real plot & not counting Pinhead's birth & flashbacks to the first film, only appear at the 53 minute mark. However they are given a little more screen time here, as does their master Levithan. Frank, the main villain in the original, is given a cameo appearance here & one can also see that Kirsty betraying Frank & leading the cenobites to him in the first film, has not dampened his sickening lust for his niece either. To be truthful, he is really only here in order to see him get his by Julia, seeking revenge for killing her in the original, since he serves the plot not at all. The character of Steve, Kirsty's love interest in the first film, is wisely dropped from the sequel, although one can well see a potential romantic interest going on between Dr. Channard's assistant Kyle & Kirsty, that never gets developed, as he is bumped off rather quickly. Director TONY RANDALL takes the directorial reigns from CLIVE BARKER (Who serves as Executive Producer here) & his direction serves the film well.On the downside however, there were things that bothered me, such as the following It is revealed midway that the message Kirsty thought she received from her skinless father believed trapped in hell, is actually from Frank, who was manipulating her in order to help him escape, making Kirsty's trip to hell rather pointless, since she never once runs into her dad & despite shedding some light on the cenobites & hell itself, the viewers visit into the cenobties universe, disappointingly turns out to be nothing more than a series of dark, dusty labyrinth hallways & despite it being around since the beginning of time, there's hardly anyone, if anyone, there. The film also fails to answer the questions of how Julia was able to emerge a bloody skinless corpse & yet Frank was forced to bludgeon several victims in order to obtain their blood, since he was a dry & rotting husk of a corpse. Julia also is able to retain her original human look & yet Frank couldn't? Julia remarks to Channard that she has such sites to show him & seems to have unlimited knowledge of hell itself & yet she has only been there one day? Channard has three puzzle boxes in his home & then later in the film, we see several mental patients playing with a series of them, is there more than one main puzzle box then? What is Channard doing with a picture of Elliot Spencer, Pinhead's human form? How can Channard, Julia & Frank all be killed, when they are already in hell? Kirsty meeting up with Frank in hell, also slows the exciting amount of momentum the film story had going in & who grabbed the mover & pulled him into the bed in the end sequence?. Continuity errors also abound In the original film, Kirsty's house burned to the ground, yet here, it is once again standing as the cops are investigating it. One of Julia & Frank's victims is found in a large wicker basket full of maggots, & yet this same corpse was hidden in the large oak cabinet in the first, while a rotting boned dusty corpse falls out of a large cabinet instead? The last film ended with another soon to be victim set to buy the puzzle box from the Asian seller, but this is never referred to here. I also admit to not caring much about giving the cenobites a back story, specifically having them be human at one time & Kirsty helping them to remember their humanity, I felt this watered the characters down some, wherein the original film, one assumed that they were always centuries old minions. Thankfully the sequels tended to ignore all of this & the story tends to jump around a lot.All in all, HELLBOUND HELLRAISER II despite it's many shortcomings, is one of the best horror films ever made & to be truthful, they really didn't need to do more sequels to this franchise, simply because the film ends with the cenobites dead & Levithan put to sleep no long able to control the minds of those in it's midst. Julia & Frank's along with Kirsty's story, has now been completely solved. Regardless of all this, I highly recommend this movie!

I thoroughly despised Maureen, and I don't know how to evaluate Robin Wright Penn's performance. Jack wasn't much better, though his circumstances contributed to this, and I believe John Travolta did a good job playing him.Other good performances came from Kelsey Mulrooney as Jack's 9-year-old adopted daughter Jeannie, Harry Dean Stanton as Eddie's best friend Shorty, and Justina Machado as Carmen Rodriguez, who sold tickets at the dance club and was a real breath of fresh air in this depressing movie despite having only a few lines. What I really liked was the music. Some of these may just have been background rather than recorded for other purposes, and some of the background music I liked but didn't pay that much attention to. -Big band jazz with the opening credits, though in my opinion the vocal performance was horrendous.-More good jazz on the way to the dance club.-Latin jazz in the dance club, but I didn't care for the vocalist.-Italian-flavored easy listening in Lorenzo's Restaurant.-Late in the movie, more good jazz as Eddie sat in Shorty's car drinking.-Still more good jazz, but in a style totally out of character for the scene, when Eddie got out of Shorty's car for the second time.-Big band jazz--but with bawdy lyrics--in the closing credits. And there were other songs used that I didn't like as much, including one Motown-type tune that I began to associate with a particularly unpleasant moment in the movie as I heard it during commercial breaks, when we were reminded what we were watching.Some people may enjoy a movie like this. Not me.

The difficult plot of the book is preserved in the screenplay as well as can be expected, and more importantly, the dark and repressive atmosphere that was predominant during that point of the middle ages is conveyed convincingly.The complex theological underpinnings of the book are omitted, which was necessary. The major plot that remains is one that Arthur Canon Doyle would surely have liked for Sherlock Holmes to have solved, if Sherlock could have been transported back in time to the late middle ages. As William of Baskerville, an elder monk of the Franciscan order, arrives with his novice and assistant Adso of Melk, they soon learn of the recent death of a young monk of the isolated abbey, a death for which foul play of some sort seems evident. William quickly concludes that the death is more easily explained as a suicide, but that leaves unanswered the question of what would have compelled a young monk to take his own life, and why so many of the monks believe that the devil himself is at work in the abbey.A second body is discovered, with the exact cause of death being uncertain, but with mysterious discolorations found on the fingertips and tongue. When the assistant librarian subsequently turns up dead, William is able to infer, from his many astute observations, certain essential facts, the most important among them being the central role of some mysterious, coveted book. But he does not know who is responsible for the two deaths that do not seem to have been suicide, and being a learned man consumed by the passion for knowledge and a love of books, he will never be content until he has discovered what mysterious book could have led to so many deaths. He is prohibited, however, along with all of the other monks except for the librarian and the recently departed assistant librarian, by long-standing rule of the abbot, against entering the library.Soon his detective work is side-tracked by the original purpose for his visit to the abbey. A delegate of Franciscans arrive, soon followed by a delegate dispatched from Avignon by the Pope and complete with the Pope's personal Inquisitor. The trials soon commence, which are of a duplicitous nature, and which are facilitated for the convenience of the Inquisitor by the discovery of a fourth corpse. This time it is the herbalist, who was overheard whispering to William, at a time when William could not take leave of the trial, that he had discovered a strange book in the infirmary. When William arrives at the scene, the book is no longer to be found. Knowing that the monk who is accused of that murder is not guilty, William defends him openly in the trial, only to find himself accused of heresy, which is also for the Inquisitor's duplicitous purposes. The only hope that William now has is to discover the truth which is protected by the secrets of the library, and he must solve its riddles quickly, lest he end up on the pyre himself.This movie will be best appreciated by fans of the book, but anyone who has an interest of that period, or who simply likes a good murder mystery, will find this to be a very enjoyable movie, even if a second viewing is needed to sort out the players and to understand the sequence of events as they unfold. As I said, the movie is missing the theological underpinnings of the book, but the fact remains that very few movies are so successful at capturing the essence of the book from which they are derived, particularly in the case of a book as literary and complex as this one. I highly recommend this movie, and for anyone with a particular interest in the political and theological history of the period, the book as well.

First, I'm not the biggest Sandra Bullock fan, but second and more importantly, the trailer does not do the movie justice at all. In fact, I would advise against watching the trailer, because it will almost destroy all interest in watching the movie, like it did to me. The problem is that the trailer gives the impression that Murder By Numbers is a murder mystery with no mystery, because it is obvious from the start that there is no question as to who the murderers are. It leaves you with the feeling that if you watch the preview, you've seen the movie. Kind of like what happened with Pleasantville.It is not long before it becomes clear that this is not a murder mystery, it's a murder thriller. True, there is never any question about who the killers are, but the point of the movie is the chess game that they play with the investigators on their trail. It is difficult to accept Sandra Bullock as a CSI, but at least in the second half of the film she pulls it off. In the first half she was going through the motions, for some reason not really seeming to believe what she was saying, or who she was supposed to be in the film. Of course, this is all just my reaction, I could be completely wrong.On the negative side, the movie comes dangerously close to glorifying the Columbine shootings, although it features one rich popular kid and one recluse as the killers, while Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold were both outcasts lashing out against the popular crowd. Richard, the popular kid, displays some odd behavior in his friendship with Justin, the recluse. He seems to think that they're dating and acts like an over-protective, jealous boyfriend, generating much of his rage from times when Justin doesn't pay enough attention to him or, even worse, kisses a girl. Justin is the brains behind the operation, having studied in great detail the investigative practices that would follow their master plan, Richard is the motivation. He really wants to do this, and the only reason that he ever gives in the movie is that he was bored. A true sociopath.On the other hand, maybe it was Richard who felt like the outcast, given his lack of success with the girls. Granted, he didn't seem to have any trouble getting in bed with the girl Justin was interested in in order to turn him against her, but consider the reaction that he always seemed to get from Lisa, which was limited to obscene hand gestures. He was, of course, of the variety of high school kids who thought that the good way to get a girl's attention was to drive up next to her blasting Iron Maiden at full volume and flashing the devil's horns. Charming. Maybe if he had tried some more romantic Iron Maiden than The Number of the Beast, like Seventh Son of a Seventh Son, or Infinite Dreams. Chicks love Infinite Dreams.The movie has a lot to say about the bureaucracy of criminal investigations, as Cassie Mayweather (Bullock) struggles to follow the strong leads that she has come across, while her boss attempts to force her to stop investigating the crime, already intent on closing the case with the tentative conclusion already reached. I'm not sure if this is meant to portray him as simply wanting the case over and done with or to show that he really doesn't care whether the real killer(s) is\/are ever caught, as long as someone goes down for the crime. Either way it's not a very glowing portrayal of authority figures.Then again, Cassie, being the only flaw in their plan, is meant to come across as this sort of reckless independent investigator, in one of the very few weak things about this movie. That's what every movie like this does. There is always someone who is forced to give up on a case because they're too close to it (the victim was a relative, lover, etc.), because they are a liability (they know the killer, the killer knows them, etc.), or because they are too dangerous (they destroyed half a city block and lost a lot of evidence). In this case, Cassie's forced to leave the case because she has found clues that might lead her to the real killers. Nice.

When relatives of mine lived in the US, we flew over to join them for the Christmas and New Year holidays. We had three films on the flight there Broken Arrow (crap), The Rock (better) and The Santa Clause (inexcusable, even for Christmas). On the return flight (which was a night flight), we had one Phenomenon. We would have had more but the power failed in the passenger section of the plane, meaning the flight was silent and the only lights we could see were on the wing. And here's the thing - you could hear a sigh of relief when the screen blacked out, as though the whole plane was thankful that the film had been taken off.Admittedly, it's not that bad but this is a long way from Travolta's best as he plays George, a fairly simple mechanic in a hum-drum farm town in the dusty middle of nowhere. The sort of place you see in Loony Tunes cartoons with Porky Pig and Foghorn Leghorn. Anyway, after drinking a few at his birthday party, George is hit by a strange light and begins to develop super intelligence and other, more mysterious powers. Can he win the heart of wide-mouthed love interest Lace Pennamin (Kyra Sedgwick) and can he prove his claims to an increasingly hostile public? To be honest, I'm having to work a bit there to explain the plot because, in truth, not much really happens.

This doesn't matter, though, because Zucker still shares a writing credit, and the series always belonged to Leslie Nielson anyway. Still, this third part isn't as good as the first two, by quite a margin. The story is less expansive this round, and the film is also a lot shorter (probably a comment on the fact that the writers were running out of ideas...), but it still has it's moments that are really funny. As usual, quite a few of the jokes don't work, but there's usually one that does just around the corner after a failed one. One sequence in particular involving Frank Drebin in a dance number is one such moment.The thin plot is mostly a parody on the crime classic 'White Heat', and it involves Frank Drebin going undercover in jail and eventually having to try and thwart an act of terrorism. Naturally, this is just a springboard for lots and lots of gags, but that's no bad thing. Leslie Nielson approaches the role with the usual gusto, and does well with it again. Leslie Nielson's comedy works because he looks so ridiculous, and he can just stand around doing nothing and make you laugh. The Naked Gun series is a good waste of time if all you want is a laugh and this second sequel delivers on that front too, although not in quite as good a way as the first two did.

The first thing that struck me was that, not having seen an older animated feature for quite a few years, the animation is almost unbearable cute and colourful. I know this is less about the period and more about the studio but I found it a little harder to get into for that reason. I did get past this very quickly thought and did find that the colourful characters were still quite fun even if it rather took away from the sense of wonder that I wanted to feel by being in this magical new world full of strange characters &#150; by animating them in this way the whole thing felt, well, almost ordinary. Likewise the Disney style of humour didn't totally suit the wit of the books and, although it did get it at times, the film felt more about bright colours than about wit and charm.The characters are pretty well imagined but I would have liked them to have more personality rather than just being made into standard Disney creations. Of course this is a minor complaint because they are still good and I'm aware I'm judging the film by modern taste &#150; perhaps unfairly. It still works well enough to be worth seeing, the songs are average but there aren't too many of them and the story will still be of great value to children who will love it regardless.Overall this is a fun and enjoyable cartoon but the mix of books and failure to really deliver the qualities of wit and childhood wonder marked it down to be not as good as I had hoped.

A chance meeting on a train with stranger Bruno Anthony sees the two of them get to talking and Bruno rambling about a vague scheme about strangers swapping murders &#150; for example Bruno killing Guy's spiteful wife and Guy killing Bruno's dominating father. That way neither man can be linked to either murder but both get what they want. Of course Guy leaves the train thinking no more of this babbling fool until, that is, he claims to have murdered Guy's wife &#150; a claim that turns out to be true. With Guy the police's number one suspect and Bruno pursuing him to meet his end of the deal, Guy must work out a way out before it is too late.One of the best things about Christmas is possibly the fact that lots of older films get wheeled out in mini series of a director's or actor's work, with lots of the films over a short time period. This year, as with several years ago, Hitchcock was the man in question on one channel and I took the opportunity to revisit several of his films in that time. Having not seen Strangers for many years, I found that the majority of my memories of it actually came from the Billy Crystal film where he references it rather than the film itself; this meant that I didn't remember exactly what happens and could almost enjoy it as if it were the first viewing. As such the film is consistently gripping and enjoyable as things seem to come to a head quite quickly. At the point of Bruno's murder the film does stutter a little bit as it can't possibly keep up that momentum but even then it is still very good.Hitchcock has built the tension well within scenes and between characters and it is this that keeps the film moving along with the unknown resolution. The black and white looks crisp and very clear &#150; the use of shadows is good but done sparingly, with the majority of the film being very clear and perhaps more engaging for it. This was Walker's last film since he died a few months after making it and he is effectively unhinged here &#150; appearing coldly cruel and sane while also showing that he is very much off his head! For this reason he tends to steal his scenes easily from Granger who has more of a straight role at the start, although he does get markedly better as the film goes on and more is asked of him. Outside of these two only Elliott really has a large role and she does it well; meanwhile support is roundly good and features a small role for Carroll.Overall this is a great film. For sheer entertainment value I'm afraid that it isn't my favourite Hitchcock but it is still very good and is rightly still held in high esteem. The story is simple but is delivered at a good pace and with tension, the direction is good and the cast are roundly strong even if Walker tends to effortlessly steal his scenes. Overall a great film and one that is definitely making sure that you've seen.

A chance meeting on a train with stranger Bruno Anthony sees the two of them get to talking and Bruno rambling about a vague scheme about strangers swapping murders &#150; for example Bruno killing Guy's spiteful wife and Guy killing Bruno's dominating father. That way neither man can be linked to either murder but both get what they want. Of course Guy leaves the train thinking no more of this babbling fool until, that is, he claims to have murdered Guy's wife &#150; a claim that turns out to be true. With Guy the police's number one suspect and Bruno pursuing him to meet his end of the deal, Guy must work out a way out before it is too late.One of the best things about Christmas is possibly the fact that lots of older films get wheeled out in mini series of a director's or actor's work, with lots of the films over a short time period. This year, as with several years ago, Hitchcock was the man in question on one channel and I took the opportunity to revisit several of his films in that time. Having not seen Strangers for many years, I found that the majority of my memories of it actually came from the Billy Crystal film where he references it rather than the film itself; this meant that I didn't remember exactly what happens and could almost enjoy it as if it were the first viewing. As such the film is consistently gripping and enjoyable as things seem to come to a head quite quickly. At the point of Bruno's murder the film does stutter a little bit as it can't possibly keep up that momentum but even then it is still very good.Hitchcock has built the tension well within scenes and between characters and it is this that keeps the film moving along with the unknown resolution. The black and white looks crisp and very clear &#150; the use of shadows is good but done sparingly, with the majority of the film being very clear and perhaps more engaging for it. This was Walker's last film since he died a few months after making it and he is effectively unhinged here &#150; appearing coldly cruel and sane while also showing that he is very much off his head! For this reason he tends to steal his scenes easily from Granger who has more of a straight role at the start, although he does get markedly better as the film goes on and more is asked of him. Outside of these two only Elliott really has a large role and she does it well; meanwhile support is roundly good and features a small role for Carroll.Overall this is a great film. For sheer entertainment value I'm afraid that it isn't my favourite Hitchcock but it is still very good and is rightly still held in high esteem. The story is simple but is delivered at a good pace and with tension, the direction is good and the cast are roundly strong even if Walker tends to effortlessly steal his scenes. Overall a great film and one that is definitely making sure that you've seen.

I found it to be pretty decent for it's genre and when I saw it was made by the same people as Castle Freak, it made sense why. Those are the only 2 movies I've seen by them and so far, they are 2 for 2.Scientist Herbert West (Jeffrey Combs) has discovered a re-animating agent that when injected into a dead person or animal, they come back to life. Zombies, basically. They have to be killed again because they go crazy and kill others.A lot of things do not quite make sense together, such as why they would try to bring back a loved one to cover up the fact that he was killed for one but I'll just chalk that up to panicked thinking on that characters part.The movie was a little dated but, for the most part, I enjoyed it. The main character was developed slowly and mysteriously so you would not know what to think of him. Finally his secret was revealed and he has been working on the re-animating agent the entire time.The two Stuart Gordon movies I've seen had pretty much the same feel, even though they were ten years apart. I can recommend this movie if you like the dated feel of these types of horror movies, kind of like Rocky Horror, but without the stupidity and the homosexual themes running rampant. No dudes wearing panties in this one. 6.5\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"13 January 2005","score":"2 out of 8 people found the following review useful","review":" I have heard about this cult classic horror movie for years, never having the option to see it until recently.

Not a false note in the directing or the writing. Weir is a master storyteller and it's never been more evident than in this film. A terrifically thrilling beginning and ending, and the middle of the picture is a sensitive, poignant exploration of the differences in the cultures. Harrison Ford and Kelly McGillis play their roles flawlessly, as does Josef Sommer and the remainder of the cast. Were this film to be released today, it would surely be noticed by the Academy. Wonderful use of locations. Having spent time in the Amish Country, this film puts the viewer in the heart of it. A wonderful soundtrack by Maurice Jarre. One of only three movie soundtracks that I have ever purchased. Highly rated.

The problem with this movie was editing and studio involvement. From commentaries seen in the DVD, the director (Fincher) has disowned the movie and would not help with the Quadrilogy. The original cut of the movie was considerably shorter than the assembly cut, which was far superior. It tells the story of Ellen Riply, hero of the series, as she crashes on a prison planet inhabited by a group of double y males, all convicted for brutal crimes. But oh no, this does not stop Ripley from creating her own style of havoc and unrest between the prisoners, not to mention the alien showing up. The assembly cut, being much longer, and having changed many scenes entirely, goes deeper into characters, includes an entire side plot that is quite interesting, and makes the movie loads better. Sure, some of the effects are poorly done, but what it lacks in certain computer generated imagery, it gains by telling the story of a lone woman trying to cope with the dangers of this creature, and more importantly, trying to cope with being alone in this struggle, for the aliens have taken her life from her. First by taking her friends and co-workers in alien, then as a result of blowing up her ship, cryo-sleeping through her life, then when we think all is well, the aliens take away Dwane Hicks and Newt when her EEV crashes on the planet. Yet she lives on. The underlying theme is loneliness and perseverance, which was missed by most audiences. It is very well done even if it is not the scariest movie ever, and i think alien 3 is definitely better than most gave it credit for.
