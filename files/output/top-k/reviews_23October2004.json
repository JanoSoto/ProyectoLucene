If ever there was a film that was more style than substance this must be it. I won't spoil the paper thin plot for you, suffice to say its about near infidelity and its effects on the couple. Although the visual effects of this film, namely the sinister masked orgy costumes, work rather well the musical score really detracts from the film. Nerve jangling piano was the intention, headache inducing annoyance was the actual result. Every time anything happens someone starts plonking the piano keys like mad. Kidman is watchable as ever but rarely engages you with a lackluster performance. Its Tom Cruise though that steals the show with bad acting. Ask Tom to show concern, uncertainty or fear and he'll clutch his face. I lost count of the times he did this during this movie in an attempt to convey some emotion. He is supposed to be ultra-desirable to virtually everyone in the film and the rest of the cast drool over him while he gives his patent 'eyes too close together' look and inane grin. Vast swathes of the film are pointless and have nothing going on and the last half hour or so are aimless and boring in the extreme. Stanley Kubrick is a talented director but this ones barely worth watching. The final word of the film is utterred by Kidman and it's F*CK I can only add Off to this pretentious and dull effort.

I loved the old cartoon and toys when I was a kid, but this movie just does not have what it takes to be good in any way.First of all, the story is terrible. Bringing He-Man to the cheesy 80s United States was a major mistake that could not be overcome. I mean, where's Prince Adam and Eternia? All we ever see of Eternia are 8 guys in bad costumes looking up at a projection of Skeletor on a stage. The plots of the cartoons were actually totally superior (which is sad).Dolph Lungdren is big, but has absolutely no charisma as He-Man. The other characters are simply there for the sake of being there. There is no connection between characters that shows any emotion. Not so ironically the best acting comes from teenager Courtney Cox. She doesn't have good lines, but at least she comes across as sincere, which is a talent of hers.Evil-Lyn and Skeletor's mercenaries are completely wasted. Evil-Lyn does nothing other than continually walking onto scenes leading the drone troops.We don't get to know any of these characters. In one of the many what could have been moments, Evil-Lyn puts an electronic choker around the teen boy's neck. The director stays on a dumb side-angle two shot of the two of them, when a good director at that moment would have gotten close-ups of them or of the device. We could then have seen the fear in the boy's eyes, or the glimmer of evil in Evil-Lyn's. Finally, when we do see a close-up it is way too late to evoke any emotion at all - the moment has passed. I could go on and on about such similar moments, but this is what distinguishes good directors from bad. Do you think Spielberg would have missed that moment?Ultimately, the cheesy 80s decor, weak costumes, and awful opening titles also betray the film. Langella can't even save it with his hamming. It probably shouldn't have been made and came almost two years after He-Man's heyday of 1983-5. The effects were not able to do what was necessary and most of all, there are so many great characters from the toys and cartoons that are absent. Where's Stratos, Ram-Man, Trap-Jaw, Mer-Man, etc.??? Only Beastman, Teela, Man-at-Arms, and Evil-Lyn are here. What's worse is each is wasted.

It seems people felt that the acting was not up to par, the script was almost laughable, the FX shots were cheesy and this was just generally a bad movie.They didn't get it.I would never have considered myself a fan of the original TV series, though I do remember in my teens watching it on British TV on a Sunday afternoon when there was little else to do, often with lunch. Let's be honest here; it was hokey, campy and its relationship to science fiction as a genre started and stopped at the spacecraft and the robot. The rest was filler. Given that though, the original pilot was actually pretty dark; obviously a failed attempt at a very serious TV series that was degenerated to a comedy by the public impression that Irwin Allen could not produce a serious show.And so we come to the movie. If you go into this expecting a campy sci-fi series bought up to date you'll be disappointed. Similarly if you go in expecting a serious movie more along the lines of the original pilot you'll also be disappointed. However, if all you want is to be entertained for two hours and not think too hard about the science, this is about as good as a typical summer blockbuster gets. It's a comic-book rendition of the concepts laid out in the pilot, and it shows.While the script is sometimes a little off, the well established actors such as Mimi Rogers, Gary Oldman and William Hurt chew up the material and create a charged and enjoyable atmosphere. Gary Oldman especially whips out yet another character who's intelligent, thoughtful and utterly evil. A comic-book stereotype if ever there was one and I can't think of anyone else who could've pulled it off quite so well.Although the pacing trips a couple of times throughout the movie, the story generally moves along at a rapid and enjoyable clip. Don't expect good science from this; there isn't much here for the real science geek... but while the science may not be perfect it's at least not so glaringly and annoyingly wrong as in Armageddon for example which I can't sit and enjoy due to the stunningly bad science especially in Act Two of that movie (right after takeoff).I truly feel that this movie could've been the start of a reasonably enjoyable franchise, but there were too many people who were ready to pan it because it wasn't what they expected. Granted, the trailers probably had much to do with that since they either made the movie out to be a campy takeoff of the TV show, or a serious Sci-Fi movie. This is neither, but put in perspective of being a comic book in and of itself, this is actually a highly enjoyable movie for anyone who just enjoys the pleasure of being told an engaging and enjoyable story. I doubt there will ever be a sequel to this movie for all the reasons I detailed above; for a start the actors are getting older and are no longer the people as portrayed in this movie, the children especially. However, if there were ever a sequel then I know I would be first in line at the theatre to see it. Yes, I enjoyed it that much.On that note, I usually find children in movies distracting and detracting from the rest of the movie. However, Lacey Chabert and and Jack Johnson do a wonderful job of being both fun to watch and a believable pair of siblings who mask their true affection for each other in barbs and insults... I know, I have younger siblings as well!Take a chance; sit down with some popcorn and someone you love... if you have kids then there's nothing here that will really negatively affect them either. Let the world melt away and just enjoy this movie as it was meant to be enjoyed; as a comic-book bought to life. You might find it better than many other movies that tried the same formula.

With two overprotective parents (Swoosie Kurtz and John Carroll Lynch) Jimmy has never really experienced the real world and never left his room. This all changes however when his best friend and love of his life Chloe (Marley Shelton) decides she is getting married near Niagrara Falls. Creating his own little bubble suit, Jimmy decides to set off across America with the aim of telling Chloe how he feels.A film about a boy who is trapped in a bubble sounds like a really bad idea. With what seems like limited ideas, the story should be a brief twenty minute sketch where he gets bounced all over the place. Amazingly however, Bubble Boy actually works. Lasting 84 minutes, this story is a light hearted comedy which makes the audience smile and at times produces large amounts of laughter.Gyllenhaal in the title role is superb. Proving he can do other roles than the dark and surreal, this actor plays a role which most up and coming stars would reject. Playing it well though, he makes the role his own and he makes us care for Jimmy as we learn more about this caring boy.As far as support casts go, Bubble Boy is also lucky in that everyone pulls their weight admirably. With familiar faces like Verne Troyer (Austin Powers 2 & 3), Danny Trejo (Spy Kids) and Patrick Cranshaw (Old School), the film has a brilliant support cast of comedy professionals. Ultimately it is Swoosie Kurtz who steals the show though as the over protective mother who is scared to let her son grow up.It was never going to be a particularly intelligent film, but Bubble Boy is remarkably funny and very uplifting. With a cast who do their jobs better than perhaps expected, the film always puts a smile on the face and shows just how there is someone out there for everyone.

With what seems like limited ideas, the story should be a brief twenty minute sketch where he gets bounced all over the place. Amazingly however, Bubble Boy actually works. Lasting 84 minutes, this story is a light hearted comedy which makes the audience smile and at times produces large amounts of laughter.Gyllenhaal in the title role is superb. Proving he can do other roles than the dark and surreal, this actor plays a role which most up and coming stars would reject. Playing it well though, he makes the role his own and he makes us care for Jimmy as we learn more about this caring boy.As far as support casts go, Bubble Boy is also lucky in that everyone pulls their weight admirably. With familiar faces like Verne Troyer (Austin Powers 2 & 3), Danny Trejo (Spy Kids) and Patrick Cranshaw (Old School), the film has a brilliant support cast of comedy professionals. Ultimately it is Swoosie Kurtz who steals the show though as the over protective mother who is scared to let her son grow up.It was never going to be a particularly intelligent film, but Bubble Boy is remarkably funny and very uplifting. With a cast who do their jobs better than perhaps expected, the film always puts a smile on the face and shows just how there is someone out there for everyone. Well worth a watch, especially if you fancy a laugh.

The second halve however really surprised and impressed me. I loved it!I really love old-horror movies with both Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee in it. In this movie they are better than ever together. Their acting is superb and so is the rest of the cast even though it is a bit strange that almost all of the Russians are played by Spanish people. Telly Savalas also shows up in a fun role. Savalas is probably best known for portraying Ernst Stavro Blofeld in the James Bond movie On Her Majesty's Secret Service but he also played in classics like Cape Fear (1962), Kelly's Heroes, Capricorn One and The Dirty Dozen. It's wonderful to see such fine acting in one movie because normally mainly it are just only Cushing and Lee who are the only good actors in a movie like this.Also this movie is actually scary and gory and it has a really good atmosphere. It starts like some kind of monster movie like Creature From the Black Lagoon but the second halve of the movie is more like a Zombie movie like Lifeforce (which is an underrated horror classic in my opinion with a great soundtrack).

Many think he's an awful director, but the fact is that he's efficient, fast and cheap. He gets his movies done fast and on a reasonably low budget, compared to many other Hollywood directors. Personally, I find him to be a fairly talentless director, but I haven't seen Phone Booth(which I've heard many great things about), and some claim that his movies are underrated. So here he teams up with Jerry Bruckheimer, the famous Hollywood big-time executive producer who has made tons of newer action flicks, and puts Chris Rock and Anthony Hopkins together in a buddy-comedy-action-flick about spies. There's no doubt about it; the film is fairly typical Bruckheimer action flick, and it doesn't have a lot to offer, that we haven't seen before, often better. But I think Rock and Hopkins make a good odd couple, and they have pretty good chemistry. The plot is pretty tame and typical, and it tries to keep itself interesting by throwing in a bunch of twists. The pacing is decent, and it's possible to sit attentively through the film, once, provided that you like either Hopkins or Rock(or both) enough, and enjoy this type of films. The acting is good enough. The characters are diverse, credible and well-written enough. The action is pretty good, Hopkins has some cool scenes. The humor is good, Rock and Hopkins have some great moments together. The dialog is good, especially between Rock and Hopkins. They play characters exactly like what we've seen from them before, and it works pretty good. All in all, a decent but entirely by-the-numbers action-comedy flick, good for a single viewing for fans of the people involved in the production of the film.

I had never seen a woman in a bra, in the movies, and had never seen anyone flush a toilet. Also, it was always a man who stole the money. Never a young pretty woman. One of the best scenes in the movie, I believe, is when Norman and Marion are in the parlor. Anthony Perkins was so convincing as a disturbed young man. He was trying to defend his mother for her illnessand saying at the time,how much he hated the prison she had put him in.

I have a lot of respect for Hans, all his work is SO original and every piece he does for movies fit so well.I was surprised when I saw the credits a the end and it said this was directed by Ridley Scott. He really is an awesome Director. If he can produce a movies like Alien, which was also very very good. And then produce something totally different which is just as amazing... I think that makes him a Director that should always be remembered.IF you've seen bits of this film but your put off because your not really into the Roman style... WATCH IT! You will surprise yourself and have a totally different view on this type of movie.This film has become one of my top 3 films of all time... the others being LEON, The Shawshank Redemption and now Gladiator.

It has been said that John Carpenter's movie was meant to be a sequel to the 1974 cult classic but it has never been confirmed; but if you've seen both movies you will find many similarities. Also, it's been said that Halloween is the first slasher flick of all time. I won't even discuss about it. Those topics are very important for die hard fans of the movie and horror fans in general. In my opinion, the relevance of both topics consists in giving Halloween the place it deserves in the history of horror movies.This movie surely inspired most of the 80's slasher movies and that's something to say. The Michael Myers character is an institution in the genre. John Carpenter is one of the most respected directors in the genre. The score for the movie is supreme and probably the most popular from the genre. Jamie Lee Curtis is to date the Scream Queen of the slasher movies. Donald Pleasence's character is also a role model and a necessary reference in EVERY slasher movie. The acting is excellent. Jamie Lee Curtis delivers a brilliant performance as she is extremely cute, beautiful, and knows how to scream and show fear. Donald Pleasence is also excellent. Setting the standards was Halloween's most important accomplishment.There's no gore but it isn't necessary here. That's probably the only rule that Halloween didn't establish as 1980's Friday the 13th started the whole gore in slasher flicks thing. The storyline is simple but scary. Myers killed his 23 year old sister when he was 6; since then he's been a patient in a mental sanitarium until he escapes on Halloween night 1978. Nobody knows where he's heading neither what are his motives. Haddonfield, Illinois has a reason to fear. Meanwhile Laurie Strode has visions of a man dressed in black following her. She thinks it's her imagination but later in Halloween night the nightmare materializes. The 3 deaths that the movie offers are simply great. There's so much suspense, tension, and the feeling of not knowing what's going to hapen that the scenes are truly scary. Myers looks scary as hell and the way he acts gives him a more menacing look. Halloween is an important part of horror cinema history and that's enough to own it. Witness the movie that started the craziness for masked killers, butcher knifes, frightening chasing scenes and much more.10\/10. -The first slasher movie to watch if you want to get into the genre. -The movie to watch at night when it's raining. -A basic movie for the genre, it gives a name to fear in movies.

I was first bewildered that he was cast as a Greek doctor coz I had always thought John Hurt was one of the most 'British' actors I'd seen on screen but he pulled it off very well, from his tanned complexion (much thanks to the location I guess) down to his impeccable accent. Nicholas Cage tried to do his best and you could see his diversity and I appreciated the efforts he took, especially since he has Italian roots (Coppola). Christian Bale also shone as Greek patriot desperate to fight for his country and he was so passionate that I could almost fall in love with him. The worst miscasting however, was that of Penelope Cruz. Yes, the role was supposed to be of a simple Greek island girl and perhaps they couldn't find any other actress who was beautiful but not too extravagantly gorgeous that it'd make her believable in the role. But Penelope Cruz couldn't grasp the Greek accent and she had no chemistry with either Nicholas Cage nor Christian Bale.They did stretch the movie out to show the intensity between Captain Corelli and Pelagia before they actually made a love. I tend to squirm at supposed love dramas which have nothing but sex. The movie showed that Pelagia was desperately in love with Mandras but his patriotism was too much for her handle and instead she fell in love with Captain Corelli's carefree ways. It took a while but I shan't question the director for the length though it could probably test your patience a bit.If anything else, the location and gorgeous scenery make up for any defects the movie has. I can't stand war movies but I make exceptions for movies like this coz the scenery makes up for the violence and intensity of the plot. If anything, they score points on cinematography.
