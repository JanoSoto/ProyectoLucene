He has a knack for the dark, strange, and off-kilter. He also has the ability to creatively combine such elements with comedy, and yet also leave behind an aura of existential reflection. His films often create some sort of deeper emotion in the viewer, making a lot of his films dramas disguised as comedies. However, put all that to the wayside because Beetle Juice is just Mr. Burton having fun. The movie is about two people who die before going on vacation. Their ghosts remain in there house, where they must live for eternity. The problem arises when a family of nutty art freaks move into their house and start to take it apart and give it their own artistic flare. In order to get rid of these people they call upon the undead conman Beetleguese (pronounced beetle-juice like the title of the film). Wacky and grotesque situations occur from here, taking us on a bizarre ride.Tim Burton's true artistic form comes through most of all in this film. The design of the characters and settings in this film are very cool. Particularly the spirit world, which is set up as a busy public office, reminding me a lot of a DPS office or a post office. Of course everything has some sort of ghostly flare to it and everything is very fun to look at and admire the work put into designing these aspects of the film. Then of course the people in this spirit world are equally crazy. The rule of thumb is that the way you look in the spirit world is the way you looked when you died. So I'm sure you can guess that there are some interesting looking people in this world. There's everything from a shrunken head victim to zombified football players who evidently died in some sort of crash. All of the main characters, especially Beetleguese himself, look very strange and off the wall, giving the film its consistently morbid yet humorous feel.That tone is one of my favorite things about the film. Obviously, the whole film deals with death. But this morbid idea is made into something very fun and different. The film is never depressing or overtly morbid, instead it's a sarcastic kind of morbid that makes you laugh at the irony of the whole situation these characters get themselves into. It also helps when the characters are the same kind of satirical oddness. All of the characters are very unique and very fun and the cast does a great job portraying it.Geena Davis and Alec Baldwin play the two leads, Adam and Barbara. They do a great job as the quiet newlyweds who don't want a lot out of life, but end up getting mixed up in so much more than they bargain for. They open the film very well, but it really gets nutty when the new family moves into their house after they die. This new family of three consists of two bizarre parents played by Jeffrey Jones and Catherine O'Hara. Jones plays Charles, the short tempered father who wants nothing more to relax in his new country home. Catherine O'Hara is the mother of the family, Delia, who is an aspiring artist. Her character makes a lot of fun of the artists in this world who take abstract art way to far, so much that it just looks silly and makes no sense at all. She is neurotic and high strung, making her a hilarious character throughout the film. A young and beautiful Winona Ryder plays Lydia, the Gothic daughter of the family who is very into self-expression through bizarre and overzealous clothing. Then of course there's Michael Keaton as Beetleguese who is so grotesquely entertaining from start to finish.I can't say a whole lot about this movie other than it simply being fun. It isn't a life changing film. It is brilliant and it is far from one of the best movies ever made. But it is definitely fun and holds plenty of entertainment. I got plenty of laughs from the film which is carried very well by a funny cast playing great characters. Tim Burton creates a fun visual experience in Beetle Juice so I wouldn't recommend missing this film. It's well worth the watch.

That man was Frank Serpico, the man this movie is centered around. This film was another teaming up of Sidney Lumet and Al Pacino, and while the results were not as good as when they teamed up for Dog Day Afternoon, the film still has a lot of merit. The highest merit perhaps is that Pacino's performance as Frank Serpico is now credited as one of his best. The role was more than perfect for the loud mouthed, rough and tough Pacino. The film itself is about Serpico's fight against police corruption and the horrible ridicule he received from his peers for it. It is a true story of courage and perseverance.The story behind this man Serpico is definitely interesting. It was surprising to see just what lengths he went to in order to expose this corruption which all his peers don't seem to have an issue with. It was really pretty shocking to see the darkest side of law enforcement and just how low they could stoop to pick up some extra cash. Serpico's role in all of it was very interesting as he at first had to sit by and watch it happen. As the film progresses he does more and more about it until he has a full fledged investigation by the end, working precariously and diligently to expose the corruption. Law enforcement is a complex world, and Serpico showed just how much goes into the job and the morality, or lack thereof, in its inner workings.What this film is about is undeniably interesting, but what actually happens in the film tended to lose my interest. It is a slow moving film because Serpico's battle against corruption was evidently a slow one. Not a whole lot happens, especially towards the middle. Once we see where the film is going it slows down considerably. I don't want to say that I ever lost interest in the film because I always wanted to know how the story would play out, but I became impatient at times. There are a lot of characters and a lot of locations so it is important to pay close attention to this movie at all times. It's imperative to watch this movie in the right setting and mindset, because you have to be ready for a rich and in depth story. Perhaps I wasn't. I won't know until I get around to rewatching the film.Despite anything I can say, I could never deny that Sidney Lumet knows how to make high quality films. He is someone that, at least in those days, didn't slack off on his films. He made the best picture he could and utilized any creative outlet he had to make the best films possible. Sometimes he succeeded, and other times not so much. Serpico is definitely a success in the quality department. It is a high grade film that boasts a lot of care and attention to the story it tells. The narrative style might have had some bumps along the way but the film itself is a very well constructed piece of cinema that should be recognized for what it is.I didn't love Serpico but it is no doubt a good film. The story is one that is very sophisticated and important to society. I'm not going to try to sound like I'm well versed in current day police corruption, but I would imagine it is still prevalent, making Serpico a still relevant film. And thank God that such a relevant story should be told by a director like Sydney Lumet, and that the man behind the story should be portrayed by one of the greatest actors of all time, Al Pacino.

Buzz, Mr. Potato Head, Hamm and Slinky Dog decide to go and try to rescue him but Woody gets some pressure from his other collectibles that it might be best to start a new life elsewhere. It seems many fans consider this one a lot better than the first but I wouldn't go that far. While this is still an impressive little gem I do think it falls a tad bit short of the first film for a couple reasons. The majority of this film centers in on Woody, Buzz, the rescuers and of course the new toys who want Woody to stay with them so that they can be sold off as a complete set. The group goes on several adventures while the majority of the other toys from the first film are at home and off the screen. I think this is one of the problems with this film because many memorable characters simply aren't in this film and to me that is a letdown. The first movie had one great joke and adventure after another and a truly remarkable imagination. It's fair to say that this film has that same imagination but just not as wide as the previous movie since it did feature more characters. With that said, this is still a charming little film thanks in large part to the voice work of Tom Hanks and Tim Allen. They certainly have no trouble getting back into their roles and the same is true for Don Rickles, Joan Cusack and the underrated Jim Varney. We even get Kelsey Grammar as a rather unfriendly part of Woody's collection. The Big Al character by Wayne Knight is one of the new folks that I actually enjoyed as I thought he summed up that obsessive collector quite nicely but at the same time he can't hold a candle to the mean kid from the first. The adventure that the group sets out on is pretty funny and the highlight is a terrific sequence where they're trying to cross a busy road when all mayhem breaks loose. The final ride through the airport is another nice sequence and as you'd expect the animation is terrific. TOY STORY 2 is certainly a good movie and one well worth watching but at the same time I think it falls well short of the first film.

While this is still an impressive little gem I do think it falls a tad bit short of the first film for a couple reasons. The majority of this film centers in on Woody, Buzz, the rescuers and of course the new toys who want Woody to stay with them so that they can be sold off as a complete set. The group goes on several adventures while the majority of the other toys from the first film are at home and off the screen. I think this is one of the problems with this film because many memorable characters simply aren't in this film and to me that is a letdown. The first movie had one great joke and adventure after another and a truly remarkable imagination. It's fair to say that this film has that same imagination but just not as wide as the previous movie since it did feature more characters. With that said, this is still a charming little film thanks in large part to the voice work of Tom Hanks and Tim Allen. They certainly have no trouble getting back into their roles and the same is true for Don Rickles, Joan Cusack and the underrated Jim Varney. We even get Kelsey Grammar as a rather unfriendly part of Woody's collection. The Big Al character by Wayne Knight is one of the new folks that I actually enjoyed as I thought he summed up that obsessive collector quite nicely but at the same time he can't hold a candle to the mean kid from the first. The adventure that the group sets out on is pretty funny and the highlight is a terrific sequence where they're trying to cross a busy road when all mayhem breaks loose. The final ride through the airport is another nice sequence and as you'd expect the animation is terrific. TOY STORY 2 is certainly a good movie and one well worth watching but at the same time I think it falls well short of the first film.

I learned that Twilight could have been awesome. Interview with the Vampire is the heavily romanticized story that chronicles the life of vampire Louis de Pointe du Lac. It takes place in the present day but is told through flashbacks as Louis tells interviewer Daniel Malloy his life story. The film strongly romanticizes the vampire story, but in a very respectful and successful way. Really, this film is awesome.The movie starts out pretty slow and I wasn't happy with it at first. It seemed too pretty boy and melodramatic for my taste. This was mainly due to the leading actors Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise. I found the film ridiculous to begin with, but it slowly picked up and just got better and better as Louis' life grew more tumultuous. The film delves deep into the psyche of a vampire and it is a very unique and fascinating interpretation of the eternal vampire life. The narrative style itself is also interesting because of the way it switches between past and present. The movie keeps your attention from start to finish and any time you think you might lose interest something exciting happens to grab it once more. The film really seemed to take off after the introduction of Kirstin Dunst's character who added a whole new conflict to the film. Looking back I can't think of a time when the film started to drag after it really picked up. I was hooked as soon as a lot of the romanticized BS had filtered through and the film started to get really good.The movie also stays interesting because of its diverse cast of characters that appear and reappear throughout Louis' life. The film boasts quite the A-list cast. Brad Pitt plays the main character Louis. It isn't his best role but he does a decent job for what its worth. Tom Cruise also plays a major role as Lestat, the vampire who first bites Louis, turning him into the undead monster. I was tired of him and his character pretty quickly, but I can't deny that he plays a crucial role in the story. He also plays into the end of the film which is incredible and very unexpected. Other important characters show up throughout the film such as Kirstin Dunst and Antonio Banderas. Christian Slater plays the interviewer and although he isn't in the film much, he's great when he is there.One thing that is so interesting about the film is the amount of time it spans. Louis' story begins in the 1700's and ends in the 1980's. The majority of the story takes place in the late 1700's and early 1800's, making this a period piece with vampires. What more could you want? The filmmakers took this time period and did a lot of good with it. The costumes and sets in this film are fantastic and very fitting for the time period. The research that went into this film is very evident when watching all the visual aspects come together and create a fulfilling period piece experience. The music also compliments the time period very well. The film has a great score anyways, but it is enhanced by the visuals accompanying the time period. Interview with the Vampire is a visual treat.This movie starts out very slow and it can get a little annoying, but give it some time and it will be extremely worth it. This film is a vampire story done right. It isn't for the kiddies and doesn't ever try to be. The film is extremely graphic which is good to be but I'll mention it as a warning for others. If you want a taste of the true potential of the modern day vampire story, watch Interview with the Vampire The Vampire Chronicles.

Basically Jack Crabb (BAFTA nominated Dustin Hoffman) is now one hundred and twenty one years old and recalling his younger days in the 19th Century, and he is the only surviving person involved in the Battle of the Little Bighorn. So going into flashback, we see young Jack and his older sister Caroline (Carole Androsky) being captured by the Indian Cheyenne tribe where they live in their village. While Caroline escapes and rides away, Jack stays behind to be raised by the tribe and leader Old Lodge Skins (The Outlaw Josey Wales's Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Chief Dan George) as if he was one them, and given the name Little Big Man. Grown up, Jack winds up caught by the US soldiers and ditches his Native American upbringing to save himself, and he is put in the care of Reverend Silas Pendrake (Thayer David) and his wife Louise (Bonnie and Clyde's Faye Dunaway). Mrs. Pendrake is attracted to Jack, but he doesn't give into temptation, leaves the home to become apprentice to snake-oil salesman Allardyce T.

Tarred and feathered they end up tied up by some angry customers, and one of them turns out to be Jack's sister Caroline, who starts turning him into a gunslinger to be known as the Soda Pop Kid (because of his choice in beverage). After he tires of this and Caroline deserts him, he opens a general store and gets married to Swedish woman Olga (Kelly Jean Peters), but this business goes bust and they ride out west with Gen.

On their journey however Olga is captured by the Cheyenne tribe, forcing Jack to go in search of her and rejoin the Cheyennes and an overjoyed Old Lodge Skins. Leaving once again he next becomes a muleskinner in Custer's cavalry, and agrees to help in a battle, but he sees them kill innocent women and children and turns on soldiers, and discovers pregnant Sunshine (Aimée Eccles). After saving her and the baby's life, he returns to the tribe, she becomes his wife, along with her three sisters, and he is shocked too discover that his rival Younger Bear (Cal Bellini) is now married to Olga, who does to truly recognise him anymore. After Jack has had sex for babies with all his wives for babies, winter sets in and Custer plans a surprise attack on the tribe, while Old Lodge Skins has become blind, and all his wives and child are killed in the process. Heartbroken he becomes the town drunk in Deadwood, where he is recognised by Wild Bill Hickok (Jeff Corey) who gives him money to clean up, and to be shot a minute after. Bill's dying words were asking Jack to was to see the prostitute he was having an affair with, it turns out to be Mrs. Pendrake, who he gives the money to before leaving again. Thinking he has no reason to live he plans suicide, but then he spots Custer and his cavalry, and plans to get his revenge for his family's deaths, but he instead agrees to help him once again. Jack leads the troops into the Battle of Little Bighorn, and during it we see Custer turn on Jack planning to shoot him dead, only to be killed by Younger Bear. When he goes back to Old Lodge Skins, the elderly man has come to the end of his life and is ready to die, but he does not, and accepts that he has more time to go yet, this is where the story ends.

As for the others, the honest guys, like you and me, they are simply labeled as losers, how could someone like a script where he's almost insulted? Well, just think about this, insulted by whom? by a wannabe big shot who thinks he's the king of the world simply because he doesn't need to stand in a queue, or can get the best table to his girlfriend in the restaurant? the genius of the script is that you're almost envying the protagonists in the beginning, the whole first act has a sort of joyful atmosphere where everything is fun, even when it's not. It almost makes you drool about this life where everything is easy money, girls, sex, fun, power, respect, when you, poor schmuck, has to struggle to live a crappier life ...But they ARE criminals, no doubt about that, they're cheaters, they're robbers, murderers, they cheat their wives, they stab in the back, and the only honor they have is not to rat on your friends, as if there were friends in this business anyway ... even the rules are corrupted from the beginning, why shouldn't you rat? if you're put in a position where you might do it, you're already a target ... it's a nasty, stinking, horrific world, we're proud not to belong to at the end of the film, and that's the power of the script. You follow these characters who seem cool, nice, funny (like a clown, or just like that) and you end up feeling guilty for that. The movie makes you question this weird appeal you feel to gangsters, even one of the first lines of the movie is quite significant  As far back as I can remember, I've always wanted to be a gangster ... we're like, wow! This movie goes ahead, it shouts loudly what The Godfather was trying to whisper ... from the first words of the 'Wags to Riches' song, we're literally plunged into a world, where we share the dreams of a character who wants to be a gangster, as if it was the most honorable profession. The movie doesn't even question that, it's almost normal to want to be a gangster. Scorsese has a twisted provocative approach in the beginning of the movie and it works perfectly, because it makes the ending all the more bittersweet, or all the more ironic.Which takes me to the last lines, compare them with the first. The character's story arc concludes with these powerful lines  I'm an average nobody... get to live the rest of my life like a schnook, this line is like a last slap in the face to the other schmucks who didn't realize during the movie that these guys were ALL already average nobodies, and probably worse than that, even when everything was fine ... the last grin on Hill's face after he did it 'his way' (a reference to the ending credits song) is to highlight the ridiculousness of the situation where he's trying to persuade himself he ever was someone before, but he was nothing ... he didn't exist in the papers, he didn't exist in society, he did nothing, and the only wise decision he took was to save his skin by 'ratting' on his 'friends'. This is a movie about ultimate losers, about a cruel, violent and nasty world where sooner or later, you LOSE. But you don't lose because crime does not pay, let's not be that naive. You lose because this so-called fellowship is based on a fallacious etiquette that makes friendship and loyalty totally inconceivable, at least in the long term. Consequently, when you watch the movie a second time, you realize that everything is fake from the beginning, the ending makes the irony even more palpable ... hell, the irony is even in the title, 'Goodfellas' ...Just like its glorious predecessor, The Godfather, the script is one of the most remarkable elements of the films, especially when combined with an incredible editing  you jump from a memorable scene to another, you're like watching a time capsule of the criminal world, it's an entertaining journey into crime that doesn't show how crime is fun or entertaining, but just to highlight in a more powerful way the cruelty of this world that looked so joyful, so cool in the beginning (and I don't even mention the acting)... In other words, the script is provocative, ironic and entertaining, what do you want more? better written dialogs? that's not the point. City Lights didn't need dialogs to be considered a masterpiece, nor does Goodfellas where the vocabulary is so particular, it's like another character from the film.Goodfellas, Marty's masterpiece is the quintessential Gangster film, not because it makes you want to be a gangster, but because it gives you two feelings in common with gangsters, envy and fear ... and a third one at the end, which is guilt.

You lose because this so-called fellowship is based on a fallacious etiquette that makes friendship and loyalty totally inconceivable, at least in the long term. Consequently, when you watch the movie a second time, you realize that everything is fake from the beginning, the ending makes the irony even more palpable ... hell, the irony is even in the title, 'Goodfellas' ...Just like its glorious predecessor, The Godfather, the script is one of the most remarkable elements of the films, especially when combined with an incredible editing  you jump from a memorable scene to another, you're like watching a time capsule of the criminal world, it's an entertaining journey into crime that doesn't show how crime is fun or entertaining, but just to highlight in a more powerful way the cruelty of this world that looked so joyful, so cool in the beginning (and I don't even mention the acting)... In other words, the script is provocative, ironic and entertaining, what do you want more? better written dialogs? that's not the point. City Lights didn't need dialogs to be considered a masterpiece, nor does Goodfellas where the vocabulary is so particular, it's like another character from the film.Goodfellas, Marty's masterpiece is the quintessential Gangster film, not because it makes you want to be a gangster, but because it gives you two feelings in common with gangsters, envy and fear ... and a third one at the end, which is guilt. ","genre":"Biography, Crime, Drama"},{"date":"22 December 2010","score":"2 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" Goodfellas is so realistic you feel like watching a documentary about the mob the narration is straight-forward, it doesn't try to use big words, or a rich vocabulary, gangsters proudly talk like the lucky scumbags they are. As for the others, the honest guys, like you and me, they are simply labeled as losers, how could someone like a script where he's almost insulted? Well, just think about this, insulted by whom? by a wannabe big shot who thinks he's the king of the world simply because he doesn't need to stand in a queue, or can get the best table to his girlfriend in the restaurant? the genius of the script is that you're almost envying the protagonists in the beginning, the whole first act has a sort of joyful atmosphere where everything is fun, even when it's not. It almost makes you drool about this life where everything is easy money, girls, sex, fun, power, respect, when you, poor schmuck, has to struggle to live a crappier life ...But they ARE criminals, no doubt about that, they're cheaters, they're robbers, murderers, they cheat their wives, they stab in the back, and the only honor they have is not to rat on your friends, as if there were friends in this business anyway ... even the rules are corrupted from the beginning, why shouldn't you rat? if you're put in a position where you might do it, you're already a target ... it's a nasty, stinking, horrific world, we're proud not to belong to at the end of the film, and that's the power of the script. You follow these characters who seem cool, nice, funny (like a clown, or just like that) and you end up feeling guilty for that. The movie makes you question this weird appeal you feel to gangsters, even one of the first lines of the movie is quite significant  As far back as I can remember, I've always wanted to be a gangster ... we're like, wow! This movie goes ahead, it shouts loudly what The Godfather was trying to whisper ... from the first words of the 'Wags to Riches' song, we're literally plunged into a world, where we share the dreams of a character who wants to be a gangster, as if it was the most honorable profession. The movie doesn't even question that, it's almost normal to want to be a gangster. Scorsese has a twisted provocative approach in the beginning of the movie and it works perfectly, because it makes the ending all the more bittersweet, or all the more ironic.Which takes me to the last lines, compare them with the first. The character's story arc concludes with these powerful lines  I'm an average nobody... get to live the rest of my life like a schnook, this line is like a last slap in the face to the other schmucks who didn't realize during the movie that these guys were ALL already average nobodies, and probably worse than that, even when everything was fine ... the last grin on Hill's face after he did it 'his way' (a reference to the ending credits song) is to highlight the ridiculousness of the situation where he's trying to persuade himself he ever was someone before, but he was nothing ... he didn't exist in the papers, he didn't exist in society, he did nothing, and the only wise decision he took was to save his skin by 'ratting' on his 'friends'.

Basically Dr. John Dolittle (Eddie Murphy) has now become renowned for his gift to talk to animals, in fact there isn't a day when they don't come to him for help, which annoys his wife Lisa (Kristen Wilson), and he tries to keep an eye on his daughters Charisse (Raven-Symoné) and Maya (Kyla Pratt). John does find out that Charisse plans to spend her sixteenth birthday with her date Eric Wilson (Lil' Zane), so he insists she brings him home to celebrate properly, but of course an animal informs him he is needed by the God Beaver (Richard C. Sarafian). He is told that the forest he and numerous other animals are living in is slowly being torn down by wood cutters, and the only way to save the few thousand acres left is to convince the authorities there is an endangered species living there. So John comes up with the idea to save the forest by reintroducing a trained bumbling circus brown bear named Archie (Tank the Bear, voiced by Steve Zahn) into the wild, to mate with a wild female Pacific Western bear. So Archie is taken to the forest and it is clear quite quickly that he isn't used to the environment he hasn't been in since birth, so the Doctor has to teach him a few things first. Then they spot female bear Ava (Lisa Kudrow), who he is smitten with but is failing to gain her interest or attention in having a relationship. With a little help from the other animals in the forest they teach Archie to have confidence and be romantic, and ultimately become the brown bear he should be. Meanwhile in his own life, John tries to make peace and eldest daughter without the talking to animals thing getting in the way, while also trying to stop mean Joe Potter (Jeffrey Jones) taking down the forest. Archie does manage to sway Ava by retrieving a seemingly impossible to get bees nest full of honey, but John might be too late to convince the authorities they are actually going to mate. So to stop the forest destruction once and for all, thousands of animals around the world are seen going on strike, so dogs won't go walking, race horses don't run, killer whales won't perform, birds poop all over Potter and his colleague, and much more besides. In the end, John and the animals do save the forest outside of San Francisco from destruction, and Archie and Aav did indeed mate to have three cubs together. Also starring Kevin Pollak as Jack Riley and the Alligator, Norm MacDonald as Lucky the Dog, Jacob Vargas as Pepito the Chameleon, South Park's Isaac Hayes as Possum, The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air's James Avery as Eldon, Steve Irwin - The Crocodile Hunter, Andy Dick as Lennie the Weasel, David Cross as Dog, Futurama's John Di Maggio as Seeing Eye Dog, Wassup Fish and Mouse, Resident Evil Apocalypse's Mike Epps as Sonny the Bear, Jamie Kennedy as Bandit, Cedric the Entertainer as Zoo Bear #1, A Walk to Remember's Mandy Moore as Girl Bear Cub, Malcolm in the Middle's Frankie Muniz as Boy Bear Cub and Arnold Schwarzenegger archive as White Wolf. Murphy is still reasonable as the agitated, Zahn and the help of the special effects make Archie the Bear a lovable character, and some of the other animals are cute to look at and listen to also, some of the story is I guess could have been bettered, but it's such a bad family fantasy comedy.

Not only is the animation beautiful and extremely life like but we also got a terrific screenplay that certainly brings these characters to life and really makes them something special. The idea of a film being centered on toys that come to life when no one is looking is something so simple yet so genius that you can't help but wonder why it took someone so long to do a film. The screenplay is without question one of the best ever written for an animation movie as all of the characters, from Woody and Buzz to Mr. Potato Head (Don Rickles) and Slinky Dog (Jim Varney) are perfectly brought to life. The child-like nature of the story has so much energy that you can't help but smile at each journey that the toys find themselves on. The amount of imagination in the screenplay is what makes it so special because it really does seem like something a kid would come up with while playing alone in his room with the toys. Everyone can remember what it was like being a kid and playing with these toys and bringing them to life in our minds so to see that played out on the screen is certainly something special. The film has terrific laughs but also a nice message. The voice work is terrific with Hanks and Allen clearly leading the way but that Southern draw of Varney is special as well.

True, it is a very fine performance but what really stands out amongst this film is the tone it takes with its characters and the story. Much of the film is photographed in high-key lighting amidst a sun-bathed landscape depicting the American West as an idealized place of opportunity that is sometimes occupied by evil doers.The film, while memorable for Wayne's authoritative performance, really is the story of Mattie Ross, the young girl whose father is killed and hires Cogburn to hunt down the man who murdered him.

A Clockwork Orange, based on Anthony Burgess's novel, is set in a dystopian London of the near-future. The main character is Alex, the teenage leader of a gang of juvenile delinquents, and a young man whose main pleasures in life are rape, ultra-violence and classical music, especially Beethoven. Alex is arrested and jailed after a woman is killed in the course of a robbery carried out by the gang. In jail he volunteers to take part in an experimental programme called the Ludovico technique, which effectively involves brainwashing him so that he will feel horror and nausea at the very thought of committing violent or criminal acts. The film was produced, directed, and written by that most original of cinematic auteurs, Stanley Kubrick, who finds a very original way of dealing with his subject-matter. Although it deals with social problems such as crime, violence and youth gangs it is not made in the social-realist style which had been a hallmark of the British cinema about a decade earlier. It is about as far from social realism as one can get; it is a nightmare vision of the future rather than a realistic vision of the present. The plastic-looking futuristic sets, the lurid colour scheme and the deliberately non-naturalistic acting are all intended to create an atmosphere of unreality, as is Wendy Carlos's musical score. Beethoven's music, especially the Ninth Symphony, plays an important part in the film, but for the most part we hear the Ninth in a strange, distorted arrangement for synthesiser. When Alex and his friends, or droogs, have a brawl with a rival gang, this is choreographed, stylised, almost balletic screen violence. The gang wear bizarre costumes (white overalls, bowler hats, codpieces and masks) and speak an equally bizarre slang known as Nadsat. The distinguishing feature of this private language is the many words borrowed from Russian, either in their original form (Bog for God, droog for friend) or in an anglicised corruption. (Horrorshow from Russian khorosho for good, or Gulliver from golova for head). Exactly why English slang should have been colonised by Russian in this way is never explained; if Britain has fallen under Soviet control this is never made explicit in the film. Burgess gave a number of explanations for his title, one of which is that the word orange is a pun on the Malay orang meaning man or person. (He had served as a colonial official in Malaya and spoke the language fluently). Alex, after he has been transformed by the Ludovico technique, is a clockwork man, one who appears human but who is in fact an automaton whose actions and emotions are pre-programmed by others. This gives a clue as to Burgess's intentions in writing his satire. On the one hand he was concerned that psychiatric manipulation could become a powerful tool in the hands of a totalitarian state, or even a nominally democratic one. The Britain seen here is an increasingly authoritarian society where a populist government is using strong-arm methods to fight crime, not only by brainwashing criminals but also by recruiting thugs into the police force; two of Alex's former droogs later reappear as police officers. The government's opponents, however, are also shown as self-seeking, anxious to exploit Alex's predicament for political gain. The harsh, authoritarian nature of this future Britain is emphasised by the use of uncompromisingly Brutalist modern architecture such as the Thamesmead Housing Estate as a backdrop to many scenes. On the other hand the Roman Catholic Burgess was also concerned to explore the nature of good and evil and the question of free will. The brainwashed Alex is incapable of committing evil acts, which means that he is also incapable of goodness. These views are articulated in the film by the prison chaplain who points out that goodness must arise from a free moral choice, not from compulsion, and that those who are free to choose good are also free to choose evil. Evil, therefore, is the necessary price we must pay for the freedom to be good. The choice of Malcolm McDowell as Alex was an apt one, as he is excellent at suggesting both the good and evil sides of Alex's character. In the violent scenes he plays the character with a sort of satanic glee, but at other times he is also able to suggest a surprising innocence, like a demonic choirboy. The film was immensely controversial when it appeared in 1971, largely because of its graphic depictions of violence, and there were predictable calls for it to be banned. Had it come out in 1962, when Burgess wrote his novel, it doubtless would have been, but the prevailing moral climate had become increasingly permissive in the intervening nine years and the censors were no longer prepared automatically to ban films at the behest of the puritanical. On this occasion, however, the puritans had an unlikely ally in the shape of the director himself, who withdrew it from distribution in Britain, for reasons that have never been clear, and the ban was strictly enforced until Kubrick's death in 1999. For many years this was virtually a lost masterpiece in the land where it was made, much talked-about but never seen. Since 1999, however, the film has been freely available, and we are once again able to appreciate its brilliance as a darkly satirical vision of British society which seems just as relevant today as it did nearly forty years ago and a masterly exploration of theological and philosophical issues. Kubrick made a number of great films, but it is A Clockwork Orange, together perhaps with Dr Strangelove, which remains his most personal. 10\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"22 December 2010","score":"1 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" To celebrate my 900th review for IMDb, I turn to another of my favourite films.

Welles himself gave an impressive, suitably moody performance in the title role, but all his efforts were undone by too many budget restrictions (consecutive scenes were sometimes shot years apart), leaving only a flimsy shadow of what could have been another masterpiece. Visually, the film highlights all the trademark eccentricities of its director, including some ostentatious, imitation Gregg Toland cinematography. But the shoddy editing and poorly recorded sound track diminish the impact and beauty of Shakespeare's language, and the occasional flash of brilliance isn't enough to salvage yet another compelling failure from a wayward genius.
