The story takes place in June of 1905 on the battleship well Potemkin, we see the crew of the ship are not so happy and they are revolted by the standards they have and so they stick up for themselves and when fellow crew members are nearly killed by their own officers, it seems quite the time for the crew to get up and fight. It is a dramatized version of true events but this movie really pumps up the workers as complete heroes, I mean this movie is Soviet propaganda through and through, but it's superbly well made even if it is.The man behind this perfectly crafted motion picture is Sergei Eisenstein who directs this in a way which even when it's going very slow still manages to either be thrilling or throw in some kind of thing to make it so amazing. I think what he also does is create a movie that isn't just for critics to feast their eyes on, this can be enjoyed by anyone I swear and it's actually a genuinely exciting kind of movie, although I would always watch a few silent movies beforehand so that you get the right feel of this. What Eisenstein also does is bring in all the crafts that make up a film and creates an art piece, one that's cameras are perfectly working, editing is finely tuned, dialogue (even for a silent movie) is great and then utilises production design especially in the famous Odessa Steps scene where the outfits and the general look of the scene looks amazing.This is so often placed on the lists that people compile with the greatest movies and for good reason, the reasons become even more so when you consider this was made in 1925 and it is silent, but you never truly think about that and this doesn't seem to have aged at all, in fact other than the cast the only expired thing is the Soviet Union. Yet again it is Eisenstein who makes it ageless, I felt he just knew what he wanted and did it, made a film that although is made for a certain political position, can still entertain no matter what your views on politics.I feel that again those steps are like come on, I mean those boots are just a brilliant cinematic piece. The scene is one that is thrilling yet also oddly touching with a little added darkness (well OK make that quite a bit). The choreography of the entire scene is marvellous too with the enormous cast to run and fall down it not only makes it incredible to see but you'd think also really dangerous! Don't watch this just for this scene I mean this has sublime scenes elsewhere, take for example the ending which of course I won't spoil but when you think one thing it does something else and builds you up until you are really excited to see what happens next. I think that if you consider this not your kind of film then think again, this isn't a movie that should only be shown in history classes or film studying lectures, it's a movie that should be seen because it is entertaining but also technically a film of flawless dimensions. Yes feast in what Soviet cinema has to offer and maybe you might like it quite a bit, in fact you might even be accustomed to raising a red flag above your house even if the neighbour calls you a commie.

You don't even need to watch the original to recognize the clumsiness of the atmosphere in this film. There's a reason why Hitchcock was such an innovative director of the 50's, but that isn't to say that watching some of his stylistic choices on the modernized, colored big screen might come across as eccentric or strange. By the time the late 90's rolled around, most of the popular Hitchcockian moves had been utilized to a degree of irritating. Hitchcock has become a stylistic icon, but that's not to say that quite a few of his attempts didn't die with the times. This is one of the major flaws in this BUTCHER of a film. For example, the translation of the face-front murder of Milton takes you just a bit out of the original, but rips your sides open in the context of the remake. What we might see as a previous mistake is now a glaring sore staring at you with big, stupid blue eyes.This brings me to the matter of the casting choice. Janet Leigh's wide-eyed portrayal of Marion is just innocent enough to be charming, rigid enough to be untrustworthy, and sweet enough to be pitied. Anne Heche is just... weird. I'm not one to focus on looks, but one of the major appeals to Marion is her appearance. She's absolutely beautiful and it's understandable why Norman would grow so possessive and obsessive over her after a mere few hours of conversation. Heche, though the lines are exactly the same and the directing is a horrendous copy, is an uncomfortable choice with a look that's just far too rough to make you want to protect her. Marion looks like a heroin chic and this contradicts the feel of the entire character. Already we're off to a bad start and with the unnatural scene-for-scene remakes, and it's just so obvious that this girl is not our modern Marion regardless of whether her acting is acceptable or not. As bad as Marion is, Norman is worse. Oh, so much worse. Vince Vaughn is already (particularly in the late 90's to early 2000's) kind of odd to see in anything other than comedy. Not saying that he doesn't have the chops to pull of different genres, but when he doesn't work he just doesn't work. This film is the prime example of how sometimes an actor just can't lose their name in a role, no matter how hard they try. Anthony Perkins was both physical and talent-wise a genius choice in casting. No one could have embodied the role as perfectly as he, and this is owed in part due to his gangling appearance and uncomfortable delivery. He'd never played a threatening character like this before and he'd never been taken seriously as anything other than an intelligent romantic interest or lead. HE KILLS (ha.ha.ha.) IT AS NORMAN BATES. Vince Vaughn looks like an aged frat boy. He's too used to playing likable to be awkward and not the last person you'd suspect to be a psychotic killer, which is the whole surprise and wonder of the character. You aren't rooting for him like you were with Perkins. Vaughn is obviously trying to be cute and it's so weird and so awkward in the way it's not supposed to be. The point of Norman Bates is to either trust him or crush on him, and you just do not fall for this with Vaughn. You just kind of want him to stop giggling and stuttering.This brings me to the Magnum Opus of the sins in this film WHAT KIND OF A PERSON WOULD WATCH PSYCHO AND THINK u know what this scene would be better with Norman intensely rubbing one out? That addition alone (and trust me, it's one of the only changes to the original in the whole freaking movie) alters the feel of the entire relationship between Norman and Marion! You're supposed to LIKE Norman, even as he's peeping through a wall! This scene is intended to reinforce the idea that this guy is quite a bit unhinged. Gus Van Sant destroyed the likability of one of cinema's most likable villains by turning him from a sexually confused and restrained child into a horny man who frequents in jerking it to the women he brings to the motel. Norman goes from trying to understand and fight his mother's internal screeching to a total creep with no self restraint. Bam, the relationship between Marion and Norman now has this underlying sexual tone and feels so insincere when it's supposed to be far more innocent and personal.Thinking back upon this movie, nearly every decision seems, to me, an outlandish mistake. I like Julianne Moore, but no way no how is she related to Anne Heche. Viggo Mortensen lacks the elegant masculinity of John Gavin and the tension of strong versus small, commanding versus nervous is lost between Sam and Norman. The only choice I found palatable was William H. Macy as as Milton Arbogast and even then it's nothing to scream about. Macy is about as pleasant and fitting in the role as Balsam, but the stair\/stabbing scene is still going to have you wincing through the colors.Only remake a movie when you can modernize the script enough to keep it from feeling outlandish, bring something original to the plot and something new for the audience to think about, and sustain the feel of the source material. Despite the fact that this was a word for word plagiarism of Psycho, this film managed to miss every requirement I have for remakes, and with this being one of my ultimate favorites, nothing hurts more. Stick to heartfelt originals Sant, because this is not your forté.

Strictly Ballroom can be seen as part of a New New Wave concentrating more on a modern urban Australia.This was the first film to be directed by Baz Luhrmann and started life as a stage play written by Luhrmann himself some years earlier. The story is set (as the title might suggest) in the world of competitive ballroom dancing. Scott Hastings, a young dancer, has caused some controversy within the sport by adopting a style of dancing which is not strictly ballroom in that it uses steps and moves not approved by the rule-book. Hence the title. The film has bequeathed its initial adverb to the BBC's pro-celebrity ballroom dancing contest, Strictly Come Dancing, even though in that particular context it looks rather ungrammatical. Scott has upset not only the judges and the sport's governing authorities, but also his dancing partner Liz, who leaves him for a rival, and even his parents Doug and Shirley, themselves noted ballroom dancers in their youth. Undeterred, Scott finds a new partner, Fran, and with her begins preparing for a major championship. Given that competitive ballroom dancing is, after all, a sport with its own rules, Scott's stance struck me as rather futile, the equivalent of a rugby team entering a football tournament and then complaining that they were only allowed to field eleven players, not fifteen, and that they had to play with a round ball, not an oval one. Luhrmann, however, obviously invites us to side with Scott and to regard his disregard of the rules as an admirable stand on behalf of individuality against conformism.The film forms part of what has become known as Luhrmann's Red Curtain Trilogy, the other two parts being Moulin Rouge and Romeo + Juliet. Despite being designated as a trilogy the three films do not have any characters or plot elements in common, and their only shared theme is a vague connection to the world of the theatre or of entertainment in general. There are, however, some stylistic resemblances between Strictly Ballroom and Moulin Rouge, although fewer between these two films and Romeo + Juliet, a modern-dress Shakespeare updated to the California of the nineties.Strictly Ballroom relies heavily upon standard sporting drama clichés, notably the one about the plucky underdog who comes good. Although Scott is an experienced dancer, Fran is a mere beginner, with much less experience than Liz. She is also a social outsider, coming from a poor Spanish immigrant family and (in another cliché) is plain, bespectacled and dowdy. Of course, as soon as Fran takes off her glasses and lets her hair down she proves to be strikingly attractive. She also proves to be a formidable dance with the aid of her father who teaches her and Scott the authentic Spanish Paso Doble. There is also a storyline about Scott wanting to win the competition which eluded his father all those years ago. The film seems to be building up to the traditional conclusion in which Scott and Fran win a triumphant victory at the championships, thus confounding the doubters and a corrupt official who has been trying to fix the contest in favour of their rivals, although Luhrmann has a surprise up his sleeve which rather subverts all the clichés he has hitherto been relying on.One thing which the film shares with Moulin Rouge is a stylised, non- naturalistic style of acting, although nobody here overacts to quite the same extent as, say, Jim Broadbent did in Moulin Rouge. As in the later film, the look of Strictly Ballroom is quite defiantly lurid with a palette dominated by vivid Day-Glo colours, especially reds but also pinks, yellows and lime greens, even if the camera-work is not so manic.Moulin Rouge was a film I loathed, and Strictly Ballroom shares some of its faults, particularly an unattractive visual look and campy, mannered acting with deliberately overwrought emotions. Although Scott and Fran are supposed to be the heroes of this drama, I found it difficult to identify with them precisely because of the exaggerated way in which they are portrayed. In one respect, however, this is the better of the two films. Moulin Rouge is a musical made by people who can't sing. At least Strictly Ballroom is a dance film made by people who can actually dance, and the dance sequences are very well staged. It is, however, something of an acquired taste, and one I find myself unable to share. I am not, in fact, a great lover of the Red Curtain Trilogy as a whole; I (rather unfashionably) prefer Luhrmann's more recent productions, Australia (in which he seems to be reaching back to the traditions of the New Wave) and his masterly adaptation of The Great Gatsby. 5\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"7 October 2015","score":"","review":" The Australian New Wave of the seventies and eighties, defined by films like Walkabout, Picnic at Hanging Rock, Breaker Morant, The Man from Snowy River and Gallipoli, even the Mad Max series, established a distinctive national school of film-making, characterised by an emphasis on Australia's past and her dramatic rural landscapes.

Thus, I will mostly confine my remarks to one of the themes of the film the incompatibilities that most contributed to the breakup of marriage plans between ex- Yankee sea captain Jim McKay(Gregory Peck) and his fiancée Pat Terrill(Carroll Baker), daughter of a cattle baron in the West. But, first, I would like to point out that, although not hinted in the film, the feud between the Hannasseys and Terrills was likely rooted in ethnic and religious bigotry. Hannassey is an Irish name, and the Terrills were most likely of English ancestry. This fits the general peception of the times of Irish immigrants as uncouth ruffians. Also, I should mention that Peck was very reluctant to be under the direction of the perfectionist William Wyler, whom he had worked with in Roman Holidays, who was infamous for the many 'takes' he required.Clearly, the middle-aged Jim and young Pat didn't know each other very well before Jim made the life-changing decision to retire from his nautical career to begin life as a rancher. Pat soon figured out that Jim was determined to quickly become his own man in this 'big country', not just her father's puppet. Strike one against him. She also discovered that Jim was too aloof to the rough and tumble western ranch culture for her liking. Not only did he show minimal hostility toward the rough hazing reception by the Hannassey 'boys', he refused to cooperate with the baiting challenges of riding a notoriously untamable horse, or brawling with ranch hand Steve(Carleton Heston), who also had the hots for Pat. The latter 2 challenges he eventually met, but only when there was no crowd to make him a spectacle, win or lose. Unlike some reviewers, I don't see Jim's aloofness regarding these challenges as necessarily a sign of superior nobleness. Rather they seem prudent responses.

In my opinion, this is one of his best.Along with the under-rated 1993 Heart & Souls, these two movies bookend one another beautifully. They could almost be confused as the same movie since they look the same, have the same sense of humor and have the same leading man playing essentially the same character with minor differences. It may be why the new Chances Are cover has changed from the original 1989 purple and white cover. While Chances Are has RDJ being reincarnated to reunite with his long-lost love and her family, Heart & Souls has RDJ as the conduit for five ghosts to set things right with THEIR families. I believe Chances Are edges out the deserving Heart & Souls by a smidgen due to the better romantic theme and simple storyline vs. the more complicated Heart & Souls script due to the five ghosts' story lines.As for Chances Are by itself, RDJ plays a reincarnated Louie Jeffries who was married in the 1960s to Cybill Shepherd (this was her last beauty movie where she looked stunning). Louie dies on his first anniversary and is reincarnated as RDJ. RDJ stumbles across the adorable Mary Stuart Masterson at university and eventually crosses paths with newspaper superstar, Ryan O'Neal, and Cybill, who has kept the candle lit for her dead husband for two decades, all within the first 15 minutes of the movie. Through several twists and comedic turns, RDJ realizes who he was and tries rekindling the flames with someone old enough to be his mother - and everyone else thinks he's either a gold-digger extraordinaire and\/or psychotic. The entire story reminds me of the old-time Jimmy Stewart and Cary Grant comedies of yesteryear where a little bit of overacting was allowed because it put a smile on your face no matter if the story was credible or not.The movie is light, funny, charming, and just enough romance to make it a perfect date movie. The men will enjoy the humor and women will enjoy the romance. The cast looks to be genuinely enjoying themselves which makes the unlikely story easy to swallow. Robert Downey, Jr. has always been a special physical actor. He embodies the qualities of other actors into his own persona and magic comes out on-screen.This may not be perfection, but it is worth watching as a light-hearted romantic comedy. I enjoy it every time I watch it again. It's in my top-20 rom\/coms of all-time not because it's a classic - but because all the pieces fit so well to make a fun movie experience.

In case you haven't noticed, the film is loosely based off of Jane Austen's 1815 Emma, a bourgeois look at marriage and fidelity, and Heckerling does a nice job of minimizing that fact just enough to where the film's target audience doesn't feel like the lights are off and they are struggling to stay awake during movie-time in their literature class.Moreover, Clueless is a film that's so easy to love but so hard to adequately describe why. It concerns a young, high school girl named Cher (Alicia Silverstone), your average Beverly Hills girl who speaks and acts just like you'd presume a spoiled mansion girl would. Her widowed father Mel (Dan Hedaya) is a litigator, basically meaning he gets paid to argue, so she claims, and her best friend is Dionne (Stacey Dash), who sticks by her side through all her dramatic moments and daily quibbles. One of Cher's most recent dramatic moments of crisis is when her ex-stepbrother Josh (Paul Rudd) comes to live with her and her father temporarily during the same time a new girl by the name of Tai (Brittany Murphy) enrolls in Cher's high school. After playing matchmaker for two nerdy teachers, Mr. Hall and Miss Geist (Wallace Shawn and Twink Caplan, who are based off of Mr. Weston and Miss Taylor in Emma) in efforts to improve her lackluster grades, Cher is convinced that she can turn Tai's rather average personality and beauty into knockout-level by fixing her wardrobe and mannerisms and setting her up with Elton (Jeremy Sisto), a wealthy jock, despite her fondness for Travis (Breckin Meyer), the troublemaking slacker.Heckerling, who takes over the screen writing job as well, really works not only to keep Clueless moving at a pace that consistently keeps the audience interested, but to humanize these often dehumanized, and admittedly unlikable, characters. Thinking back to our own experiences in high school, I'm sure we could put other names to every character I just listed and Heckerling does that in order to form that kind of connection. Most teen films have that kind of familiarity with their story. However, instead of stopping there, she works to illicit a kind of humanization that makes you sympathetic to these characters. By the end of the film, or even midway through, Cher doesn't seem like such brash diva with a credit card, but a strangely harmless figure wrapped up in herself to a fault.Cher may be a bit intoxicating and cocky, but one thing she isn't is harmful or a bully to those not in her league. Even her efforts to set Tai up with Elton instead of Travis, while a hasty and somewhat cold to her friend's personal feelings, isn't meant to be a ploy nor an attempt to oppress her character whilst holding on to her popularity. She's a more complex figure than one initially assumes because her efforts are just misguided and her attitude is more conceited than open; she's not a particularly bad person or the queen bitch of her high school.Heckerling's dialog in the film is sharp and biting, as if every character on-screen unabashedly says what's on his or her mind rather than locking down their feelings for a more socially acceptable comment. Consider Josh's response to Cher she asks him if there's anything she could selflessly do that would benefit humanity. Josh opens the refrigerator door before turning around and replying with, sterilization. This kind of dialog carries throughout the film and no character here feels out of Heckerling's beautifully satirical, revealing little universe; nobody feels like they're not in on the joke nor lost in their own role.Clueless, I feel, speaks to the millennial generation and those born in the early 2000's better than anybody, though nobody would be removed from enjoying this; the familiarity of Austen's novel on older viewers and the casual depiction of the teen scene on the younger viewers is one makes this film have almost universal appeal. However, the way Clueless moves with a certain stride in its hips, like a teenage girl with a new outfit, the way it talks, with a Californian accent that has every syllable hitting your ears in a unique manner, and the way the music, the dialog, and the mannerisms of the characters resonate so fiercely, is what ultimately makes it a winning combination of an ordinary chick flick and a biting teen film.Starring Alicia Silverstone, Brittany Murphy, Paul Rudd, Stacey Dash, Breckin Meyer, Jeremy Sisto, Wallace Shawn, Twink Caplan, Donald Faison, and Dan Hedaya.

Her widowed father Mel (Dan Hedaya) is a litigator, basically meaning he gets paid to argue, so she claims, and her best friend is Dionne (Stacey Dash), who sticks by her side through all her dramatic moments and daily quibbles. One of Cher's most recent dramatic moments of crisis is when her ex-stepbrother Josh (Paul Rudd) comes to live with her and her father temporarily during the same time a new girl by the name of Tai (Brittany Murphy) enrolls in Cher's high school. After playing matchmaker for two nerdy teachers, Mr. Hall and Miss Geist (Wallace Shawn and Twink Caplan, who are based off of Mr. Weston and Miss Taylor in Emma) in efforts to improve her lackluster grades, Cher is convinced that she can turn Tai's rather average personality and beauty into knockout-level by fixing her wardrobe and mannerisms and setting her up with Elton (Jeremy Sisto), a wealthy jock, despite her fondness for Travis (Breckin Meyer), the troublemaking slacker.Heckerling, who takes over the screen writing job as well, really works not only to keep Clueless moving at a pace that consistently keeps the audience interested, but to humanize these often dehumanized, and admittedly unlikable, characters. Thinking back to our own experiences in high school, I'm sure we could put other names to every character I just listed and Heckerling does that in order to form that kind of connection. Most teen films have that kind of familiarity with their story. However, instead of stopping there, she works to illicit a kind of humanization that makes you sympathetic to these characters. By the end of the film, or even midway through, Cher doesn't seem like such brash diva with a credit card, but a strangely harmless figure wrapped up in herself to a fault.Cher may be a bit intoxicating and cocky, but one thing she isn't is harmful or a bully to those not in her league. Even her efforts to set Tai up with Elton instead of Travis, while a hasty and somewhat cold to her friend's personal feelings, isn't meant to be a ploy nor an attempt to oppress her character whilst holding on to her popularity. She's a more complex figure than one initially assumes because her efforts are just misguided and her attitude is more conceited than open; she's not a particularly bad person or the queen bitch of her high school.Heckerling's dialog in the film is sharp and biting, as if every character on-screen unabashedly says what's on his or her mind rather than locking down their feelings for a more socially acceptable comment. Consider Josh's response to Cher she asks him if there's anything she could selflessly do that would benefit humanity. Josh opens the refrigerator door before turning around and replying with, sterilization. This kind of dialog carries throughout the film and no character here feels out of Heckerling's beautifully satirical, revealing little universe; nobody feels like they're not in on the joke nor lost in their own role.Clueless, I feel, speaks to the millennial generation and those born in the early 2000's better than anybody, though nobody would be removed from enjoying this; the familiarity of Austen's novel on older viewers and the casual depiction of the teen scene on the younger viewers is one makes this film have almost universal appeal. However, the way Clueless moves with a certain stride in its hips, like a teenage girl with a new outfit, the way it talks, with a Californian accent that has every syllable hitting your ears in a unique manner, and the way the music, the dialog, and the mannerisms of the characters resonate so fiercely, is what ultimately makes it a winning combination of an ordinary chick flick and a biting teen film.Starring Alicia Silverstone, Brittany Murphy, Paul Rudd, Stacey Dash, Breckin Meyer, Jeremy Sisto, Wallace Shawn, Twink Caplan, Donald Faison, and Dan Hedaya.

Cube opens with six people trapped in a cube shaped room with doors on every side. Everyone in the room is different there are no similarities between them. One is a doctor, another a police officer, one a math student in college, one a guy who just is, a mentally handicapped man, and an escape artist. Together they must uncover the mystery of where they are and what they are doing there. But it gets worse as they discover that some rooms are booby trapped and others aren't. The whole premise for the movie is simple and that is what I think makes it such a spine tingling movie. The characters and the audience don't know anything about what is going on, creating a never ending feeling of unease. The acting in this movie was amazing, and I really felt like I was part of the group in the cubes. I tensed up at the most tense scenes, I was horrified by the traps, and when the police officer went crazy I felt the fear of Leaven and Worth as he chased them through the cubes. But it's not just simplicity and the acting that make this movie scary, it's the deep look into the human mind and how it deals with terrifying situations. It was interesting to see the whole spectrum of how humanity deals with possible death spread out over all these characters. One other thing I liked is the ending it fit perfectly with the whole movie there was no tearful reuniting with family members or staring at the sun in amazement. Instead there is the last guy you would ever expect to get through the whole maze walking off into a bright light. There is no hint of what is beyond the cube, a mystery movie that ends with a mystery, perfect. Cube was a fantastic look into the mind of humanity and how long it can last. It may be one of the scariest thrillers I've ever seen even without an antagonist. So I give it 9\/10.

When warden Drumgoole was pushing him to far, he remind me on Sheriff Teasle from First Blood (1982) I love this film and is definitely my third best Stallone favorite film from the 8o's. After this movie action stars copied this film and make a prison action Drama film.

Lock Up is a very underrated action prison drama that has a heart and I love it to death. He was just pushed to hard over the edge and he fought to stand alone in this prison action movie.

But when it looks as if he is losing his battle, and endangering all he holds most dear, the family dog is the last hope for his family's survival... and the end to his Werewolf curse.The movie made many significant changes from the novel, particularly in the make-up of the family, which in the novel consisted of two parents and three children, as well as the dog, who sees the family as his pack, which must be defended at all costs. The dog's perceptions of events are treated in great detail, as is the relationship between him and his human family, and his confusion as to whether the werewolf is a threat to his family that must be eliminated, or a pack member who must be respected. These subtleties mainly did not make it into the film.This film got bad reviews and bombed at the box office. I won't say it's the greatest werewolf film, but it is far from the worst. The opening scene should have garnered it some fans... that's a rather intense gore scene. Now, allegedly a few seconds were cut out. If that's true, I can only imagine how intense that would be. (Director's cut, perhaps?) Worth checking out. If nothing else, it is better than some better-known 1990s werewolf films, like American Werewolf in Paris.
