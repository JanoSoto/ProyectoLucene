As the film begins, Vito is receiving business guests in his office at his home while his daughter Connie's (Talia Shire) wedding and reception are taking place. The epic plot takes place over many years, telling the story of Vito, his family--including Michael (Al Pacino), Santino (James Caan) and Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), his associates, and their interactions with other mob syndicates.The Godfather is commonly considered to be one of the greatest films of all time. Even though I've given it a 10, I wouldn't put that same kind of exalted emphasis on it. I've given literally thousands of films 10s over the years, and for me, Godfather just barely made a 10. I think it has a number of flaws, but Coppola also has a knack for transcending the problems with some brilliant move or another. At any rate, it is definitely must-see viewing--even if it's only because it's so highly regarded--if you've not experienced the film yet. I think it's a good idea to attain cultural literacy, and films as popularly loved as The Godfather become necessary elements in achieving that literacy.Shorn of its gangster trappings, The Godfather is sprawling and soap-operatic in tone. The sprawl is appropriate to its origins as a novel by Mario Puzo, who also co-wrote the screenplay with Coppola. There is a large cast of characters--maybe too large, as it can be difficult to keep track of just who everyone is. Even after you've watched the film a couple times you may find scenes where mobsters seem to spontaneously appear and you catch yourself saying, Wait, who is that guy supposed to be again? The soap opera angle can be a positive or negative depending on your tastes. I tend to not like soap-operatic stories, but of course Coppola put yummy gangster topping on this one to make it palatable for guys like me. At root, though, The Godfather is concerned with realistic depictions of a very dysfunctional family as they try to make it through life--including marriages, births, adultery, spats between family members, tiffs with others in their community, and so on. My theory is that the soap opera angle accounts for much of the film's appeal. For me, it (and the slight lack of focus from the sprawl) accounts for much of the reason that I barely gave the film a 10.But two things help the film transcend a lower score for me. Even though the gangster stuff has been far surpassed in graphic brutality in the intervening years, the dramatic context of the violence usually gives it tremendous impact. Films like Ichi the Killer (2001), which I just watched for the first time the night before watching The Godfather again, make the Godfather's brutality fit for Sesame Street in comparison. However, although Ichi's violence is effective, setting that knob to 11 doesn't make it better. Besides, Ichi is so over the top that it would make many Godfather fans want to hurl.To the extent that Coppola and Puzo just focus on the extended Corleone family, they create tremendous depth in their relationships. The whole film can be looked at as a fascinating depiction of oscillating dynamics in the family, with the pole pairs being interacting\/distancing, control\/lack of control, benevolence\/malevolence. Most character stances and actions are some combination of those ranges of characteristics, and everyone dances around the poles, so to speak, throughout the film. From this angle, even the attractive surface violence (well, attractive to us fans of that stuff in artworks) is mainly there for the purpose of pushing characters more to one pole or the other. There is an implication that underlying these mechanisms is some natural tendency towards achieving (a dynamic) equilibrium.But there are more superficial stylistic factors that help push my score up to a 10, also. The most obvious, which everyone and their grandparents have mentioned, are the performances. It's tough to go wrong when you have a cast including Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall, James Caan, Diane Keaton, and so on. Another commonly mentioned element that I agree is fantastic and superbly integrated to create atmosphere is Nino Rota's score.Less often mentioned is the consistently intriguing cinematography by Gordon Willis. Most of Willis' unusual shots in the film are so subtle as to be barely noticeable unless you're looking for them. The opening, for example, consists of a long (it lasts a few minutes) zoom out from Amerigo Bonasera (Salvatore Corsitto). The shot is beautifully lit--most of the frame is extremely dark, giving Bonasera a chiaroscuro effect (the opening is also unusual in that it's a long monologue from a minor character).Willis and Coppola have a knack for placing their actors in the frame to create depth and interesting visual patterns. This is done so slyly that at first blush you wouldn't believe it's something they thought about, but if you keep this in mind while watching, you can see delightful visual paths that zigzag, wind to a focal point, and so on, all created by the confluence of actors and scenery in the frame.If you haven't seen The Godfather before, the most important thing you can do before watching is to forget about all of the greatest film of all time hype. That's only likely to set up expectations that could never be met; more than likely you'll be disappointed. Just think of it as one of the better films from one of Hollywood's more admirable but relatively odder directors, featuring earlier performances from a very well known cast, and keep in mind that it's as much a historical family saga as a crime or gangster film.

Well I ate my words and it didn't taste very well... the movie is Brilliant! And I do in-fact love this film! I thank everyone that told me to watch this movie! Yes Donnie Darko is a very dark, thrilling mystery film that will leave you days later pondering the film. It is well worth watching! ***********Spoiler***********Time Travel - if you could go back in time, what would you change? Donnie Darko decided to go back in time to die - to save others from their deaths and any pain that Donnie himself may have caused others. The movie shows how one person can influence the lives of others. For example If Gretchen Ross had not have met and gone out with Donnie then she would not have died that night.*****************************This is a film you may have to watch more than once to full get a grip on everything that is going on. I highly recommend this movie but be prepared to think during and after the movie - it is one of those types of films.10\/10 ","genre":"Drama, Sci-Fi, Thriller"},{"date":"25 June 2014","score":"","review":" I have watched The Princess Bride probably a dozen times, but I have only viewed the film because it is on my top ten of classic movies. I have never had enough knowledge to properly analyze the film and provide an educated review. Thanks to a film class, I know feel as though I can give a proper assessment of the film and my view as to why it is such an amazing film.In my opinion, the theme of the movie is for pure entertainment that includes comedy, action, sorrow, empathy, imagination, and of course 'true love'. Most of the movie revolves around true love and the battle for the cause. The Princess Bride is a fairy tale of a farm boy named Westley (Cary Elwes) and his true love Buttercup, played by new actress, Robin Wright. Their love was torn apart for a brief moment when word got back that Westley had been murdered by the Dreaded Pirate Roberts. Three years pass and Buttercup is now engaged to a conniving, scheming Prince Humperdink (Chris Sarandon). In a plot to start a war with his enemy country Guilder, the Prince has Buttercup kidnapped by three men, the inconceivable Vizzini (Wallace Shawn), a sword dueling revenge seeker Inigo Montoya played by Mandy Patinkin, and the oddly lovable, but not too smart Fezzik played by the late Andre the Giant. The trio doesn't get too far when they encounter the Man in Black. The Man in Black defeats the kidnappers with skill, strength, and wits, but his encounter with two of the three is not quite over. Buttercup assumes that the Man in Black is the Pirate who killed her true love until she hears him scream, while rolling down a hill, As you wish. The two lovers are reunited. Their elated happiness is cut short when the Princess catches up to them and Buttercup offers to return to the kingdom if he returns Westley back to his ship. The cowardly Prince lies to the future princess and has Westley taken to the 'pit of despair'. In a jealous rage, the Prince kills Westley so he may marry Buttercup. Unfortunately for Humperdink, Indigo and Fezzik find the mostly dead Westley and revive him with a miracle pill from the hilarious Billy Crystal who plays the Witch Doctor.The new trio devise a plan to break into the castle to stop the wedding so Westley and Buttercup may be reunited once more and so Inigo may have his revenge against the six fingered man who killed his father played by Christopher Guest (Count Tyrone Rugen).Both Westley and Inigo achieve their goals of reuniting with true love and revenge. The foursome ride away on four white horses into the sunset to live their fairy tale lives.I enjoy how the director used set back drops, lighting, musical score, and camera angles to provide the viewer with an enjoyable experience. From the very beginning you know the era and country region of the setting for the love story. The rolling country, the wood cabins, and the lack of population allows the viewer to know that it's probably turn of the century time period. The writer, William Goldman hints that the theme is a love story with in the first 10 minutes through narration as well as with visual aesthetics. The film reaches both the adventure lover, the comedian, as well as the soft hearted with the use of dialogue, action, and images. The film is filled with action scenes from sword fighting, wrestling, battling of wits, and of course a little blood. If you are one that enjoys comedy this movie is for you as well. The screenwriter and director do a fantastic job of adding human into the film with the one liners, the awkward moments, and great characters. If you enjoy fairy tales about true love and happiness, well you will be hooked in the first 10 minutes. All the little details of action, humor, and love are tied together with a magnificent score that will get your heart beating and your emotions running.One of the aspects that I picked up during the movie while analyzing was the great camera angles and lighting. One scene in particular that stood out was when Inigo was using his father's sword and spirit to guide him to the Man in Black. Before the sword starts leading him, the lighting behind Inigo hints that his father spirit is there and guiding the sword. The light surrounds Inigo and he looks like an angel. I never noticed that before now. I also enjoyed that the director took the objective point of view for most parts of the film. He allowed us to sit back and watch the love story unfold by using wide shots and large backgrounds. I don't think that there were many scenes that had dead screen areas either. Overall, I loved this movie before I watched with an analytical mind and I still love it. If anything I enjoyed it more for those areas that I have missed in previous viewings. I am glad that this film is for pure entertainment and it is not a struggle to watch. It's one of those films that you can come home from a stressful day at the office or during those rainy weekends, pop a little popcorn and the movie into the DVD player and sit back and laugh, feel, and love every second of it. I love this movie and I think you will truly love the movie as well.Enjoy!!

The picture and sound are first-rate and has several very interesting extras. Perhaps the most interesting one is Henry Hill himself talking about his former life as a gangster and stating that this movie is at least 95%, no 99%, realistic and true. Crime reporter Nicholas Pileggi helped Hill write the book Wiseguy, published in 1986. This movie is based on that book. He died the day after he turned 69, in 2012.Many consider this Martin Scorsese's masterpiece. It isn't my favorite genre, it contains lots of violence and gore, plus lots of graphic cursing. But for its type, yes it is a masterpiece.Among the gangsters we have Robert De Niro as James Conway, Ray Liotta plays Henry Hill who also narrates, so we know he will survive. Joe Pesci is devastatingly good as the despicable Tommy DeVito who will shoot anyone outside the family if he gets mad at them. Paul Sorvino is Paul Cicero.So what we have is a portrait over a couple of decades of these men who look at their life of crime as their business. They see an opportunity, they arrange a heist, that is their life. But it is a dangerous life with a short cycle, they will each soon be in prison or be killed.In the end when Hill sensed that he was being set up for an execution, he and his wife tried to run only to be caught by the Feds. He ended up being the star witness to put the others away, in exchange for his freedom.As an aside of sorts, some of the scenes are set at the Copacabana club, and in one we get to see Jerry Vale singing, while in another Bobby Vinton's son is shown lip-syncing an original Bobby Vinton song.

A lot of people went off them as they progressed, many feeling that Freddy was getting too comical and just not scary any more. Personally, I didn't mind his more 'humorous' persona, but I think I was slowly becoming the minority.Here, in what we might as well call 'Part 7,' the man who originally created Freddy (Wes Craven) returns to the helm one last time. Now Freddy is trying to break out of the movies and into real life to stalk and kill yet more victims. And, despite the formula being similar, i.e. if you fall asleep then Freddy will get you, the major change is that Freddy is now back to his 'evil only' roots. Gone is the humour and the one-liners and, in its place, pure nastiness. Also, Freddy's 'look' has slightly changed. They've redone his make-up which you may or may not appreciate.What you have here is a 'Freddy film' which is more akin to the original Nightmare on Elm Street than its successors. The first half seems to meander a little, but it's worth sticking with it, as the second half picks up the pace.If you're a fan of Freddy, whether you like him pure evil or comic evil, then you should enjoy this one. It may be a little pretentious in places when it tries to mess with your mind as it mixes 'real life' with the original Elm Street mythology, but it's still good fun. My only real gripe was the child actor who is one of the main characters. I know children can be touch and go when it comes to their acting abilities, but this one really doesn't cut it when he needs to.

A lot of people went off them as they progressed, many feeling that Freddy was getting too comical and just not scary any more. Personally, I didn't mind his more 'humorous' persona, but I think I was slowly becoming the minority.Here, in what we might as well call 'Part 7,' the man who originally created Freddy (Wes Craven) returns to the helm one last time. Now Freddy is trying to break out of the movies and into real life to stalk and kill yet more victims. And, despite the formula being similar, i.e. if you fall asleep then Freddy will get you, the major change is that Freddy is now back to his 'evil only' roots. Gone is the humour and the one-liners and, in its place, pure nastiness. Also, Freddy's 'look' has slightly changed. They've redone his make-up which you may or may not appreciate.What you have here is a 'Freddy film' which is more akin to the original Nightmare on Elm Street than its successors. The first half seems to meander a little, but it's worth sticking with it, as the second half picks up the pace.If you're a fan of Freddy, whether you like him pure evil or comic evil, then you should enjoy this one. It may be a little pretentious in places when it tries to mess with your mind as it mixes 'real life' with the original Elm Street mythology, but it's still good fun.

All of those combinations make Re-Animator one of my favorite Horror\/Zombie movies,a Horror classic and Cult Classic.Based on H.P Lovecraft's story of the same name,Re-Animator tells the story Dan Cain(Bruce Abbott),a Miskatonic University Medical student who needs a roommate to share rent on a house. Dan gets a roommate in Herbert West(Jeffrey Combs),an eccentric scientist who has transferred to the university. However,Dan gets more than he bargained for when finds out Herbert West conducts bizarre science experiments using a serum chemical that brings people back from the dead and when Cain decides to help West the results are lead to chaos and insanity for Herbert and Dan.1985 was an amazing year for Zombie movies with the release of Horror\/Zombie classics such as George A. Romero's Day Of The Dead,Dan O'Bannon's The Return Of The Living Dead and last but not least Stuart Gordan's Re-Animator,a brilliant and unforgettable Horror film that is not one of the best Horror films of the 1980s and of all-time band since it's 1985 release has gained a very strong Cult following. Right from the very beginning Re-Animator is an amazing Horror-Comedy that for it's 85 minutes gives viewers a terrific and memorable movie that is twisted and offbeat,weird and hilarious as well as gory,bloody and disgusting. Director Stuart Gordon takes the concept of amazing Horror classics such as Frankenstein(1931)and The Bride Of Frankenstein(1935)and takes the concept of bringing back the dead even further with Re-Animator. The genres Horror and Comedy are two sides of the same coin because both Horror and Comedy can get you to react either by making jump out of your seat or making you laugh and Re-Animator does both with such greatness and that's one of the reasons I love the film. On the Horror film side,Re-Animator doesn't rely on scares or suspense although the movie has some suspenseful scenes but on the blood and gore and when the blood and gore comes it never stops and the gore will disgust viewers. At the same time despite the blood and gore Re-Animator is never meant to be taken seriously because the movie has a manic and wild energy that makes you just forget about the gore. The Comedy and Humor in Re-Animator is hilarious and funny with a dark Comedic glee that is politically incorrect and matches the insanity that happens throughout the movie and it's the way the characters react to situations that are over the top and wild and when the horrific scenes become more horrifying you cannot help but laugh. Re-Animator is one of the best Horror-Comedies ever made and truly belongs in the great Horror sub genre known as Splat stick(a combination of blood,gore and over the top Comedy). Another thing that I also love about Re-Animator is that some of the dramatic moments and scenes have the look and feel of a Soap Opera like Days Of Our Lives or The Young And The Restless where each of the serious moments are so dramatic you just burst out laughing with joy. The main character Herbert West is one of greatest and truly most unforgettable characters in the history of Horror films and when you see him the first time in the beginning you are aware that West is very insane insane to the point where he only cares about bringing back the dead in such an obsessive way which make Herbert West funny in a twisted way. Despite the chaos and damage West is causing he continues to work on his experiments with craziness and determination and that is one of the things that makes Herbert West so iconic,funny and is a great character that you will never live on forever. The ending of Re-Animator is terrific and memorable because there is blood,gore and plenty of laughs,shocks and surprises that will stick with the viewer. A classic ending to a great film.The cast is great. Jeffrey Combs is excellent and iconic as Herbert West,with Combs being insane and delightfully over the top. Bruce Abbott is terrific as Dan Cain,West's partner in crime. Barbara Crampton is amazing and beautiful as Megan Halsey,Dan's girlfriend. David Gale is fantastic as Dr. Carl Hill,a rival of West's. Robert Samspson is wonderful as Dean Halsey,Megan's Father.The direction by Stuart Gordan is amazing,with Gordon always moving the camera and giving the film a stylish look with a few tracking and long shots that reminded me of a Stanley Kubrick film. Great direction,Gordon.The score by Richard Band is outstanding and matches the tone of the film even though most of the score was ripped off from Bernard Herrmann's score in Psycho(1960). Great score,Band.The special make-up effects are outstanding,bloody and realistic and add to the film's greatness. Outstanding special effects.In final word,if you love Horror Films,Zombie films,Horror-Comedies or genre films in general,I highly suggest you watch Re-Animator,an excellent,hilarious and unforgettable Horror classic that you will never forget after you watch it.

The commercials are as soulless and forced as this rushed cash grab of a sequel and the film begins with an embarrassment of over acting and over the top violence. We start off with the three of the lamest criminals and some of the worst scenery chewing day players to ever act in a film. The actor who gives a line reading of I really like this gun, man brings ham to a whole new level and the tone of RoboCop 2 remains as obnoxious and over the top. Director Irvin Kershner has no command of this material and the attempts at subversive humor are cartoonish and manhandled. What worked so well in the first film was Murphy regaining his humanity and the first thing this film does is take it away. Murphy watching his family from his car sets off alarm bells at OCP when his wife threatens to sue and then somehow without clearance or any reason to be there she materializes to where Murphy is kept to sleep and be programmed - despite that she sent in her lawyer to speak on her behalf about Murphy leaving her and her son alone. Because this film decides to sidestep any challenging content that would take effort to write, Murphy basically tells her to get lost and that her husband is dead. He is then reprogrammed which makes him into a lame punchline of a joke that goes on for far too long, as he malfunctions being super nice and shooting at a person smoking a cigarette. Nancy Allen has said the shooting of RoboCop 2 was the worst experience of her career and that Kershner couldn't stand her and wrote her out of as many scenes as possible. Her character Lewis is simply a connection to the first film and provides barely anything to the narrative. Instead we get Willard E.

The commercials are as soulless and forced as this rushed cash grab of a sequel and the film begins with an embarrassment of over acting and over the top violence. We start off with the three of the lamest criminals and some of the worst scenery chewing day players to ever act in a film. The actor who gives a line reading of I really like this gun, man brings ham to a whole new level and the tone of RoboCop 2 remains as obnoxious and over the top. Director Irvin Kershner has no command of this material and the attempts at subversive humor are cartoonish and manhandled. What worked so well in the first film was Murphy regaining his humanity and the first thing this film does is take it away. Murphy watching his family from his car sets off alarm bells at OCP when his wife threatens to sue and then somehow without clearance or any reason to be there she materializes to where Murphy is kept to sleep and be programmed - despite that she sent in her lawyer to speak on her behalf about Murphy leaving her and her son alone. Because this film decides to sidestep any challenging content that would take effort to write, Murphy basically tells her to get lost and that her husband is dead. He is then reprogrammed which makes him into a lame punchline of a joke that goes on for far too long, as he malfunctions being super nice and shooting at a person smoking a cigarette. Nancy Allen has said the shooting of RoboCop 2 was the worst experience of her career and that Kershner couldn't stand her and wrote her out of as many scenes as possible. Her character Lewis is simply a connection to the first film and provides barely anything to the narrative. Instead we get Willard E. Pugh, who plays the mayor, in a performance that's so over the top and terrible that he should be banned from ever appearing on screen. It's dreadful performances like this that Kershner can not modulate and just cranks everything in this film up to an 11 out of 10. Peter Weller has also complained that the film has no real 3rd act and he is right, the film begins all these plot threads about Detroit being manipulated by OCP, Murphy stalking his family, nuke addiction, political corruption, police strikes and so on - and every thread is dropped to have a machine brawl for an ending.

And some of the characters were impossibly annoying! Not anymore Chuck, I quit! Gah, that bitch thoroughly deserved to get her Razzi! I was never able to sit through it without fast-winding.. To me, it was stunning how badly they misjudged the material. After how terrifically Roland Emmerich staged mass destruction in Independence Day, I was really excited to see what he could do with Godzilla. But, yeah.. What a wasted opportunity. Did anyone in the audience ever walk out thinking that wait a minute, hadn't they already seen the same thing done elsewhere, like in Jurassic Park, not to mention done better? At the climactic seen where Godzilla's on top of the Brooklyn Bridge and he's hit by the missiles which knock him off the bridge and kill him - Even as a kid I thought what, that's it? That's all it takes to kill him? It didn't take a fan to recognize that this was just plain anticlimactic, like someone pulling out a gun to shoot the bad guy in the finale of a martial arts film. I will say though that I thought the follow-up animated series that they did was not too bad at all. They kept a loose continuity with the feature film, and despite being unable to use any of Toho's famous monster characters, did a decent job of making an interesting set of stories from week to week. One time they even had him up against Quetzalcoatel! They at least had the smarts to make Godzilla a bit more powerful and aggressive, edging him closer to what the original Japanese series embodies. Sigh, I might have liked this picture a lot more if it had been called something other than Godzilla(!) At best, it's a below average monster-on-the-loose film, one that rips off a true classic I might add Q the Winged Serpent, a film which unlike this one, is not soulless. Aside from the title of the movie, it has nothing to do with Godzilla. I mean of course they should have tried to do their own thing and in their own way, but if you are going to call it Godzilla, then you should at least retain some basis of the original character. That was their fatal flaw - they discarded *everything* except the name. Instead of a somewhat invulnerable dinosaur-like creature with dorsal fins, aggressive and destructive nature, that's equipped with his signature atomic breath and distinctive roar, and a symbol of the nuclear threat, they gave us a radiation-mutated lizard with no special ability who runs from conflict and destroys things by accident. In the end he is easily killed by a single volley of conventional weaponry. There's no discernible subtext to this turkey other than let's make money!!!

Seeing Linda's Blair's head spin around and vomit some green muck was a little unnerving to see I guess, and there were a couple of other little moments, piths of unease you could say. This was when director Friedkin was making great films, yet there's no film I really hated of his, except may'be for The French Connection which I just found slow, where I just didn't sit out the battle. The film has a fantastic script, and brilliant story structure, where we sympathize with Blair's unhappiness, as Daddy's split and left her with her single Mum (Burston) a famous actress as in the story, which I liked. What I liked though here, was we really got to know the family, where sadly for Blair, despite her richly deserved Academy Award, he career sadly plummeted into B grade. Noticing changes in her daughter, matters become worse for Burston, when suddenly Blair becomes one of the possessed, where an evil spirit has taken over her body. A young reclusive priest (Jason Miller, who very much reminds me of Gabriel Byrne, even with the accent) is called into perform an exorcism, and flush the spirit out. Where finding other doctors have failed, and this is over his head, he sends for a master exorcist (Max Von Sydow) to try his hand at it, at ridding the evil in the possessed Blair. He's virtually the last hope, so the scene is set for quite an intense ride. What I liked too, was how we were taken into Miller's life in the priesthood and personal, where his Mum is very sick. Scary or not, I just love this movie, first seeing it back in 2001. It may stretch reality some, where we wanna believe it is possible and it may not be a terrifying ride for some, but what gives the movie it's buzz is as I said, the finely written script, and the lives within in the characters in it, something most horror films fail to do.
