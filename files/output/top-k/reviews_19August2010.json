[{"date":"19 August 2010","score":"","review":" The Man Who Knew Too Much was one of a number of films with an espionage theme made directed by Alfred Hitchcock during his early British period. It involves what was to become a recurring feature in Hitchcock's work, that of the man or woman who knows too much in that he or she has accidentally come into possession of certain information which places them in danger from the villains. Other films with this basic plot include The 39 Steps and The Lady Vanishes from his British period and North by North West and the remade Man Who Know Too Much from his American one. (This was the only film Hitchcock ever remade; I have not seen the 1956 remake for a long time so I will not attempt to compare the two films directly).Bob and Jill Lawrence are a British couple on a winter sports holiday in St. Moritz with their daughter Betty. (Betty is played by Nova Pilbeam, who three years later would star in Hitchcock's Young and Innocent). One evening a Frenchman named Louis Bernard, whom they have befriended, is shot dead in their hotel. It turns out that he is a spy and before dying he passes them some vital information be delivered to the British consul. Unfortunately, the villains realise that the couple are in possession of the information and kidnap their daughter to ensure their silence. (One might ask why they don't simply kill Bob and Jill, but if they did that there wouldn't be a film).Afraid to contact either the consul or the police, the Lawrences return to England where they carry out their own investigations and discover that the villains intend to assassinate a distinguished European statesman named Ropa during a concert at the Royal Albert Hall. (This was an early example of Hitchcock's fondness for setting key scenes in, or on, famous buildings or structures). This leads into two suspense sequences, the first during the concert itself, the second during a confrontation between the police and the assassins at the hide-out where they are holding Betty captive.The shoot-out at the end of the film was based on the Sidney Street Siege, a real-life incident which took place in the East End of London in 1911; Hitchcock would have been a boy at the time, living in Leytonstone only a few miles away. The criminals involved in that siege were anarchist refugees from Tsarist Russia, but in the film we never learn what nationality the assassins are, what their political motivation is or why they want Ropa dead.At 72 minutes this is one of Hitchcock's shortest films; it is, for example, little over half the length of the 1956 remake, even though that version omits some plot details such as the final shoot-out. It has a concision and brevity which are well suited to the thriller genre, with few distractions from the main plot, although there are some humorous asides in the early scenes in Switzerland and in the scene in the church used by the mysterious religious cult which serves as a front for the terrorists. It also has, unusually for early Hitchcock, a memorable villain in Peter Lorre's Abbott, the suave and outwardly charming leader of the assassins. There are some outstanding villains in some of the films from his American period, such as Joseph Cotton's Uncle Charlie in Shadow of a Doubt, Robert Walker's Bruno in Strangers on a Train and Anthony Perkins' Norman Bates in Psycho, but in his British period he tended to concentrate more on the heroes. Lorre's performance is all the more remarkable given that he could not speak English at the time and therefore had to learn his lines phonetically.This is not the best of Hitchcock's British spy thrillers. Leslie Banks and Edna Best- an early example of the Hitchcock Blonde- seem a rather stolid, Mr and Mrs Average Suburban Couple, lacking the charisma of Robert Donat and Madeleine Carroll in The 39 Steps or Michael Redgrave and Margaret Lockwood in The Lady Vanishes. Those films were a brilliant combination of suspense, comedy and romance which have remained classics despite the passage of more than seven decades since they were made. The Man Who Knew Too Much, by contrast, is a well-paced thriller, highly effective given the technical limitations of the period, but not in the same class as those masterpieces. 7\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"19 August 2010","score":"","review":" The Man Who Knew Too Much was one of a number of films with an espionage theme made directed by Alfred Hitchcock during his early British period.

Eventually, Republic Pictures agreed to finance the film provided that Ford agreed to make a Western for them with the same stars, John Wayne and Maureen O'Hara. (The result was Rio Grande). Wayne was, of course, a frequent collaborator with Ford, and the film also features two other such collaborators, Victor McLaglen and Ward Bond.Sean Thornton an Irish-American from Pittsburgh, returns to his native village of Innisfree (a fictional village named after the real island featured in Yeats' poem) and purchases the farmhouse in which he was born. Thornton also falls in love with a local girl, Mary Kate Danaher, but unfortunately she is the sister of the local squire, who dislikes Thornton because he wanted to buy the farmhouse himself but was outbid. Thornton and Mary Kate eventually marry, but a further dispute arises when Mary Kate's brother, Will, refuses to give his sister the dowry to which she is entitled by custom and makes it clear that, if she wants it, Thornton will have to fight him for it.This leads to a clash between husband and wife. Thornton is not short of money and cares nothing about the dowry, which he does not need, and refuses to fight Danaher. Mary Kate does not need the money either, but for her it is a matter of principle and she brands him a coward for failing to confront her brother. He in turn brands her obsession with obtaining the dowry as greedy and materialistic. Unknown to her he has another reason for not wanting to fight. In America he was a boxer, but quit the sport after accidentally killing an opponent in the ring, vowing never to fight again.This scenario could have been the basis for a serious film, even a tragedy. Thornton does, after all, face a potentially tragic dilemma, the choice between the love of his wife and loyalty to his pacific principles (which have earned him the nickname of the quiet man). The film is, however, broadly a comedy, although it occasionally veers towards greater seriousness. Ford and McLaglen, for example, are never quite sure how Will Danaher should be played; at times he seems like a comic braggart, all bluff and bluster, while at others he comes across as a nasty bully and genuine villain.The best acting performance is probably from Maureen O'Hara; at least her Irish accent, unlike some of the others, is genuine. Wayne seems a bit outside his comfort zone, and Victor McLaglen seems miscast as Will Danaher, being more than thirty years older than his supposed sister O'Hara. It also seems unlikely that someone in his mid-sixties could have held his own in a fist-fight with a man twenty years younger who once fought as a professional heavyweight boxer. (Will is referred to as Red Will, even though McLaglen did not have red hair. Given Will's capitalist greed this is unlikely to be a reference to his politics).The film is ostensibly set in the post-independence Irish Free State, but the real location of the action is Hollywood's own version of Ye Olde Merrie Ireland, a timeless never-never land of thatched cottages, of pints of Guinness, of fiery red-haired colleens, of happy peasants who speak in accents so thick that you expect every other word to be begorrah! or bejasus!. It is a place quite untouched by the religious conflicts which bedevil the real Ireland; both the local Catholic priest and (perhaps more surprisingly) the local Protestant vicar play important roles in the story. The only allusion to the civil war which had only recently torn the country apart is a single gratuitous reference to the IRA. It is a place of happy endings, where two grown men can beat seven bells out of each other for about ten minutes without either of them suffering a bruise or a scratch and then sit down happily together to sip their Guinness, best friends forever.This sort of idealised ethnic stereotyping is not necessarily a bad thing in a film, at least not in a comedy. Moreover, it is not necessarily confined to Hollywood. The picture of England painted in Ealing comedies like The Titfield Thunderbolt, also from the early fifties, can be equally idealised. Yet The Quiet Man is not a film I really care for. Too often its genial Oirishry serves as a cloak for some unpleasant behaviour. The scene where Thornton physically forces Mary Kate to walk back to the village with him from the station indicates that he is at best a bully and at worst guilty of domestic violence. I thought that he gave up his pacifist principles far too easily; his reasons for refusing to fight were honourable ones and his wife only wants him to fight over an empty point of principle. (When Thornton finally gets the money he throws it, with Mary Kate's full approval, into the fire). A Man's Gotta Do What a Man's Gotta Do might be an appropriate moral code for the lawless Old West. In an otherwise peaceful Irish village it just seems like a recipe for pointless brawling. Perhaps Ford's Ireland is not so idealised after all. For an Irish-American he is surprisingly ready to rely upon Anglo-Saxon prejudices about the Irish being hard-drinking, talkative and quarrelsome. 4\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"19 August 2010","score":"7 out of 18 people found the following review useful","review":" The Quiet Man, set in 1930s Ireland, was an unusual departure for John Ford, best known as a director of Westerns, Ford, however, was himself of Irish descent and had long cherished the ambition to make a film based on the original short story by Maurice Walsh, first published in 1933.

The theme has been a popular one in the cinema and on television ever since at least the classic Errol Flynn version from 1938. In my childhood in sixties Britain the definitive Robin was Richard Greene, hero of a famous TV series, and Sean Connery (who has a brief cameo here as King Richard) and Audrey Hepburn starred together in Robin and Marion in the seventies.In this version the hero is Robin of Locksley, an English nobleman who is captured while fighting with Richard the Lionheart in the Crusades. Robin escapes from prison and returns to England accompanied by Azeem, a Moor whose life he saved during the jail-break. (The idea of having a Moorish character among the Merry Men appears to have been borrowed from the earlier British TV series Robin of Sherwood). Upon arrival, however, he finds that in King Richard's absence England is being ruled by the cruel Sheriff of Nottingham who has murdered Robin's father and seized his lands.The film breaks with tradition by inserting the character of Azeem and omitting Prince John, normally one of Robin's main antagonists; perhaps the film-makers felt that it was best to concentrate on the Sheriff rather than have two principal villains. In most other respects, however, it keeps to the traditional story. Robin escapes into Sherwood Forest where he joins forces with a band of outlaws, refugees from the Sheriff's tyranny. Robin and his men fight back against the Sheriff by robbing him and his wealthy supporters then distributing the stolen money and goods among the common people. (This is only justice as they have acquired this wealth by imposing harsh taxes on the poor).Robin also meets and falls in love with the beautiful Maid Marian, in this version the sister of a comrade killed during the escape attempt. We meet other characters from the traditional story- Little John, Will Scarlet and Friar Tuck. The film has an equally traditional morality- greed is bad, oppression ditto, the common people possess hidden reserves of courage and decency, good will triumph over evil and love conquers all.Although Kevin Costner was a well-known actor in the 1980s, starring in films like The Untouchables and Field of Dreams, it was the grand epic Western Dances with Wolves in 1990, which he also directed, which first made him a huge international star. Prince of Thieves was his follow-up to that huge success. It is not a film on the grand epic scale of Dances with Wolves, but that was always going to be a hard act to follow, and Costner was probably wise not to try and copy it. In some of his later films he did indeed try to recapture the grandeur of Dances, with mixed results; Wyatt Earp was reasonably well received, but Waterworld was an unmitigated disaster, and although I personally liked The Postman I have to admit that I am in the minority on that one.Costner is not quite as good here as he was in Dances with Wolves, although he does enough to justify his reputation as an international superstar, and he receives good support from Morgan Freeman as Azeem. (Nice to see an Arab being portrayed as one of the good guys for a change; Hollywood frequently assumes that anyone of Middle Eastern origin is a terrorist or religious fanatic). The film, however, is stolen by Alan Rickman as the evil Sheriff of Nottingham, a splendidly hissable villain in the best pantomime tradition. Prince of Thieves is not particularly deep or significant, but as a family adventure film it is a pretty good one, with some well-handled action sequences, especially the attack on the castle at the end. It is never quite as good as the Errol Flynn version, but then that film has so defined our view of Robin Hood that it is difficult for any later version to compete. I would rate it higher than the Patrick Bergin film, and certainly more higher than the disappointing Robin and Marian.

The film, however, is stolen by Alan Rickman as the evil Sheriff of Nottingham, a splendidly hissable villain in the best pantomime tradition. Prince of Thieves is not particularly deep or significant, but as a family adventure film it is a pretty good one, with some well-handled action sequences, especially the attack on the castle at the end. It is never quite as good as the Errol Flynn version, but then that film has so defined our view of Robin Hood that it is difficult for any later version to compete. I would rate it higher than the Patrick Bergin film, and certainly more higher than the disappointing Robin and Marian. (I have not yet seen Ridley Scott's recent effort). 7\/10 ","genre":"Action, Adventure, Drama"},{"date":"19 August 2010","score":"","review":" Robin Hood Prince of Thieves was one of two films about Robin Hood made in 1991; the other, titled simply Robin Hood, starred Patrick Bergin and Uma Thurman, was made on a smaller budget and is much less well known today. The theme has been a popular one in the cinema and on television ever since at least the classic Errol Flynn version from 1938. In my childhood in sixties Britain the definitive Robin was Richard Greene, hero of a famous TV series, and Sean Connery (who has a brief cameo here as King Richard) and Audrey Hepburn starred together in Robin and Marion in the seventies.In this version the hero is Robin of Locksley, an English nobleman who is captured while fighting with Richard the Lionheart in the Crusades. Robin escapes from prison and returns to England accompanied by Azeem, a Moor whose life he saved during the jail-break. (The idea of having a Moorish character among the Merry Men appears to have been borrowed from the earlier British TV series Robin of Sherwood). Upon arrival, however, he finds that in King Richard's absence England is being ruled by the cruel Sheriff of Nottingham who has murdered Robin's father and seized his lands.The film breaks with tradition by inserting the character of Azeem and omitting Prince John, normally one of Robin's main antagonists; perhaps the film-makers felt that it was best to concentrate on the Sheriff rather than have two principal villains. In most other respects, however, it keeps to the traditional story. Robin escapes into Sherwood Forest where he joins forces with a band of outlaws, refugees from the Sheriff's tyranny. Robin and his men fight back against the Sheriff by robbing him and his wealthy supporters then distributing the stolen money and goods among the common people. (This is only justice as they have acquired this wealth by imposing harsh taxes on the poor).Robin also meets and falls in love with the beautiful Maid Marian, in this version the sister of a comrade killed during the escape attempt. We meet other characters from the traditional story- Little John, Will Scarlet and Friar Tuck. The film has an equally traditional morality- greed is bad, oppression ditto, the common people possess hidden reserves of courage and decency, good will triumph over evil and love conquers all.Although Kevin Costner was a well-known actor in the 1980s, starring in films like The Untouchables and Field of Dreams, it was the grand epic Western Dances with Wolves in 1990, which he also directed, which first made him a huge international star. Prince of Thieves was his follow-up to that huge success. It is not a film on the grand epic scale of Dances with Wolves, but that was always going to be a hard act to follow, and Costner was probably wise not to try and copy it. In some of his later films he did indeed try to recapture the grandeur of Dances, with mixed results; Wyatt Earp was reasonably well received, but Waterworld was an unmitigated disaster, and although I personally liked The Postman I have to admit that I am in the minority on that one.Costner is not quite as good here as he was in Dances with Wolves, although he does enough to justify his reputation as an international superstar, and he receives good support from Morgan Freeman as Azeem.

This is an excellent movie and is indisputably the best Western of Wayne's post Liberty Valance oeuvre (my apologies to fans of Cahill U.S. Marshall. haha).I gave it 6 stars out of 10 in IMDb, which is a good score with me. It accumulated 15 points in my ranking system, which is a very solid score.Here's what I liked- Unique movie about a man dying of cancer who actually was dying of cancer. Wayne had survived lung cancer ten years earlier and already had cancer again when this movie was filmed. Wayne's ersatz father figure, John Ford, died of a slow death from cancer a couple of years before this movie was made. Duke also watched his mom and brother slowly die of cancer.- One of the best acting performances of Wayne's career. - Inspired casting of Lauren Bacall. She brings the perfect tone of sadness and feeling to her role. Surprising how old she looks in this movie, though. She was only 52.- Great cameos by James Stewart, Richard Boone, Harry Morgan, John Carradine and Hugh O'Brian. Watch for Bill McKinney as Cobb, the creamery owner\/gunfighter (?). McKinney played the heavy 'redleg Captain Terrill in The Outlaw Josie Wales that same year.- Nice representation of turn of the century Carson City, Nevada, replete with trolleys and early automobiles.- Excellent comic relief by Harry Morgan, John Carradine and Wayne. This is much needed in a story that is inherently dark and depressing.- Perhaps the only Western Wayne made in 20 years where there's not an obligatory group fist fight (this could be seen as a negative, depending on your point of view haha).Now here's what the movie got wrong- JB Books character is too one dimensional. Did he really develop such a large reputation and never, ever kill anybody who didn't deserve it? Always an angel of justice? No regrets? No guilty conscience whatsoever? This serious character development flaw of the poor gunfighter dates back to 1950's The Gunfighter.Eastwood got this right in his own Western swan song Unforgiven. We like Will Munney, but he's still a legitimately disturbed and scary dude who's haunted by his past transgressions. JB Brooks biggest flaw is that he's a little grouchy sometimes.- They blew the heavy role by splitting it into three weak parts. The part should have concentrated in the capable hands of Richard Boone.- If Boone's character had been properly developed, then the final shootout might have made a little sense. As it was filmed, it almost ruins the entire movie. Why does Books feel it is necessary to kill these three men before he dies? What evil did they commit? Did the bartender have to die too? Wait a second, I thought Books only killed in self defense or if somebody was really, really, really bad. Again, compare to a much better film Unforgiven. All those guys in the bar deserved to die because of what they did to Ned.- I didn't buy the Ron Howard subplot about his redemption from juvenile delinquency. It felt gratuitous and contrived.- Nice attempt to work some landscapes into this Burbank back lotter. Not enough for my taste, though. - 1901 Carson City setting is stretching the limits of the genre Western. Took a hit in may rankings in the Indian, Mexican, Civil War category as a result.

What he ends up discovering, and what the film curiously comes to form in its detailing, is a relationship with another male he meets in New York native Enrico Rizzo, an equally young but dirtier, scummier and more criminally minded man. It is through Enrico that he is able to discover most about what it means to have aspirations and dreams in heading on out to a place like New York City from somewhere like Texas. In a film about a young man initially trying to hook up with as many girls as possible, it is interesting how Midnight Cowboy manifests into this burning and intriguing drama about two men. As the film transcends, so too do Buck's feelings; and we feel they do as we watch the fact that it is a male that further's the most development out of our protagonist.The film is a wonderfully directed piece from John Schlesinger, someone whom would go onto make another film set in New York about a relatively fresh faced youngster forced into coming to terms with some harsh realities that lurk in and around his place of dwelling, in 1976's Marathon Man. Here, he creates an affecting coming of age piece-come-fish out of water story about a guy from simplistic enough roots heading on out to the big time but hitting head on what it is to really live when you're starting from ground zero with the hope of heading up. It is Jon Voight playing Joe, a man who packs in his menial job at the local Texan diner so as to catch the bus on out of there; he sings in the shower, excitedly; a clever montage of him getting dressed afterwards suggests a degree of perfectionism to his actions as he goes out of his way to make this particular dressing a good one. Once at the diner to say his goodbyes, he's seen to profoundly stand out amidst the drab, white clothing of the workers occupying the space with him. Yes sir, this fella is going places.From there, it's New York City or bust as the bus rolls east; the radio plays interviews with women describing their perfect man and Buck struggles to contain his excitement NYC cannot come soon enough. Back home, a relationship with a girl ended in a lot more than just tears and the befuddled relationship with his only family member in his grandmother has its own tale to tell; but surely it's all good from here on in. We don't initially side with Joe, it becomes apparent the women are less than easily impressionable with certain failings to woo some women greeted with soft music suggesting a mite of pity is in order. Other times see him score, but mix ups in payment and a failed attempt at becoming a male prostitute add to a growing sense of swift disillusionment with the attitude. Where Schlesinger's direction comes in is his bringing everything down in tone, particularly evident when Dustin Hoffman's aforementioned Enrico Rizzo, a con man and vagrant, enters proceedings. Like his nickname 'Ratso' might suggest, the man is scrawny and rat-like; a limp born out of Polio killing off his ability to use one of his legs seeing him uncannily skittle from place to place. Cue a series of events which allows Joe to see the real New York, as a well paced bond between the two of them form and the film morphs into this interesting character study about a fast-talking but 'scarred' man teaming up with the self-proclaimed good looking stud whom cannot much talk-the-talk. In short, they get by the best they can without literally pulling a gun on somebody and holding them up.The film is more preoccupied with painting New York as a scummy, sleazy place of apparent no hope; something that hits home even more when we remember the film is initially about an outsider going there with so much of it. Its combining of content of a more down and out; realistic aesthetic, a studying of low level living and a generally nasty existence with people caught up in the middle of it all, with sporadic bursts of a more drug induced; more avant-gardist natured aesthetic in its dream sequences and the shooting of the day's youth down an 8MM camera lens during a rave calls to mind other such films from the era, including 1968's If.... and 1970's Catch-22. The clashing tones ought to alienate the audience, instead it plays its part in the bigger picture of things in projecting itself onto our lead as he realises that, having been situated in New York for 'x' amount of time with little return in what he wanted, a brooding sense of just why things are not making a whole lot of sense is manifesting. The two lead performers make use of the material detailing two differentiating characters in the same locale; events later transpiring to reveal Ratso is in a not too dissimilar position in New York to what Joe was back home, in that a way out is the ultimate goal and a bus ride to Florida remains the elusive dream. The film is very sad and very honest, dramatically involving in its documenting of the plights of these two and really rather well directed; culminating in an affecting, effective piece.

","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"19 August 2010","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" by Dane Youssef THE WIZARD isn't any new moniker or fun new twist on the classic story of a little girl from Kansas who gets caught in a tornado and finds herself not only over the rainbow, but in a wonderland of Technicolor and strange characters. Well, at least not exactly. This Wizard dealt with kids in peril, feeling trapped where they were. Video games were their outlet. One boy so disturbed, he became mute and later committed after witnessing the death of his sister. The older brothers living with the father after the divorce. When a child is lost, a family is too. The Wizard open with a small, determined soul walking along a long stretch of road in the pursuit of something. Some goal, some destination. Some form of escape. There's something... he's looking for. He's on his way... somewhere. Somewhere special, somewhere important. Somewhere he needs to be. It fades in like a sunrise... where is he going? We don't know. This boy's name is Jimmy. And he has a goal. He tells us, California... Jimmy, in a major institution, yet breaking loose again and again like the family cat. One day during a visit, big brother Corey takes little Jimmy and the two break loose--together. At an arcade, Corey first-hand witnesses Jimmy is Bobby Fisher's predecessor at Nintendo. They use his skills to play for money. And because it's a road trip movie, they have to pick up a woman along the way. It's a PG flick for little kids (once again, Nintendo fans), so it has to a preteen like them--and they have to be just friend. Her name is Haley, an adolescent drifter. She claims to know the score... and she can raise the money to get them where they need to go. And Halley is one sizzling hustler. Wait 'til she's old enough to develop sex appeal to add to the mix. It was my mother who recalled that old song from the He's A Pinball Wizard by The Who and suggested maybe that's where the movie got its namesake. The little ditty of some soul who was a wonder at that one arcade game. It was his world. Whoever he was. Well, if anyone could relate to that... 'Would've liked to hear that on the soundtrack at maybe some point. A lot of the world said that the Wizard is stuffed to the gills with commercials. But no, they were wrong. The Wizard WAS a commercial. For Nintendo and Universal. If we'd gotten scenes where we see Jimmy's connection to these games, how he becomes Zen, there might have actually been some real significance. We're just watching video games being played. And... that's all we as kids wanted from The Wizard. No really powerful piece of cinema, but to just see kids like us running loose without parental supervision and Nintendo being our source of rebellion. Children as resourceful as can be doing incredible things with the toys we played with and loved. Screenwriter\/producer David Chisholm seems to have cobbled this together out of spare plot threads and gimmicks. Usually filmmakers do this when they're just doing the obligated rush hatchet job and don't have their heart in the project they're working on. And you can tell--Chisholm doesn't love this screenplay of his. This is no personal project for him. This is just a Hollywood crowd-pleaser designed to feed the cult masses. The choir (us) loves video games, lives for them, thrives on them. But the makers of this movie don't. They don't care about any of this except--Here, buy this. Spend your money on... For all of those who belonged to the mass cult of Nintendo, this was the third coming. Seeing it again now with older, more experienced eyes... like an old man going back into his childhood home, the bedroom we once lived in, the bed once ours, looking over our own toys and photos... and, and... what the hell was I thinking? Was that even me? Who was that?What is Wizard? A film of our adoration for Nintendo from our childhood, which weaved together our love of movies featuring us kids as the heroes and our undying love of the video games. ...

It was not only Nature but audiences who called, and thus history was made. Would Jim Carrey by any chance be an exhibitionist? No, surely not! Not since the days of silent films has there been someone so outrageously funny who can make us laugh just by slightly altering his facial expression, and Jim Carrey really is one of those phenomena of Nature, like volcanoes, which keep going relentlessly. In this early work of his, there are so many excellent sight gags and so many brilliant lines that it is a comedy classic. We might describe Carrey as 'the man with four cheeks', due to his very rude habit of talking with his buttocks. But I suppose putting buttocks to good use like that is better than just sitting on them. He must be lovable because animals crowd round him, birds sit on him, pretty girls kiss him, squirrels and otters adore him, and we pay money to watch him being the smartest fool that ever was. His style goes back to the days of court jesters. In this film he is pitted against the intimidating Sean Young. Now as for Sean Young, we have there a true glamour gal. She was sensational in NO WAY OUT (1987) and countless other films. Here she has to play a tough cop who is suspected of being a man. If you can imagine Sean Young being a man, then you are ready to be taken away by the men in white coats. The scene where Jim Carrey strips her clothes off her intending to reveal a different anatomy than might be expected show us some of the reasons why Sean Young is so alluring, and they have nothing to do with being a guy. This film is so hilariously over the top that it is impossible to describe, just as Carrey himself is impossible to describe. No one who has never seen him can possibly imagine him. Courteney Cox does an excellent job of taking him seriously, as every Groucho needs a Marguerite Dumont, although in this case she is a delightful cutie rather than a matron. The film features real-life football quarterback Dan Marino playing himself, as the story concerns the Miami Dolphins, an American football team who breathe air while they swim round a large bowl known as the Super Bowl. Also playing himself is manic comic Carrey, bless his wobbling buttocks. This kind of crazed comedic insanity is something that only comes out of the good ole U. S. of A., the only country in the world that could ever produce a Jim Carrey (oops, I forgot, he is really Canadian, but Canadians are honorary Americans, aren't they?).

This is excessively confusing(again, MBD wasn't). Half a dozen strangers meet at a house one evening for dinner. As it turns out, they're all being blackmailed. And the man behind it is their host. Suddenly, he is dead... moments after they've all been handed a weapon each. All have motive, as well. The dialog is fast. This has twists, obviously. They almost hold up. I mean, they don't make logical sense, if that's what you're hoping for. They could have happened, sort of. There is a little disturbing content, sexual suggestion and mild to moderate language in this. The DVD comes with all three endings(with only one, it seems like this would be only 70 minutes, not 90), and it can either play a random one or all three; it also comes with a trailer. I recommend this to those that find what I describe to sound appealing. 6\/10 ","genre":"Comedy, Crime, Mystery"},{"date":"19 August 2010","score":"","review":" Starring Montgomery Clift with Anne Baxter, Karl Malden, & O.H.

His name was George A. Romero, and his film was Night of the Living Dead. Perhaps the first zombie picture to enter mainstream consciousness, Romero's feature debut would become one of the most important horror films, influencing filmmakers worldwide from Lucio Falci (Zombie, 1979) to Danny Boyle (28 Days Later, 2002) to Jaume Balaguero and Paco Plaza (Rec, 2007). Such was its importance that the National Film Preservation Board (USA) decided to enter it into its registry.Night of the Living Dead has a simple premise &#x96; a group of people struggle to hide from bloodthirsty zombies in an isolated farmhouse. Except that these people are a group of misfits, strangers to each other. There is a resourceful and rational black man, a white woman in shock, a simple-minded man with his overly concerned lover, and a selfish family man (Mr. Cooper) with a wife and a wounded daughter. Conflicts occur mainly as a result of Mr. Cooper's comic stubbornness and refusal to listen to the black man, giving the film not only an additional villain, but also a source of light-hearted relief in a dark film.For a horror film, Night of the Living Dead is substantially creepy, with the level of tension escalating as time passes. Romero's zombies are slow-walkers, afraid of fire, but never stop until they get what they want &#x96; to attack, kill, and devour live human beings. For a black-and-white film shot more than four decades ago, Night's portrayal of gore is surprisingly realistic; scenes of zombies eating an assortment of human remains e.g. limbs and organs, still retain their ability to shock in this day and age when extreme violence seems like the norm.Presented like a documentary of sorts, Romero's film is a startling and powerful commentary of the psychology of the American conscience in the 1960s. Themes include the fear of the mob, the white man's fear of the black man, the (emotional) weakness of women, and the fear of Armageddon are expressed through the characters whose actions and words are heavy with meaning. Romero also portrays the authorities (on television, no less) as distant folks who are unclear of the situation on the ground, and who think that relaying the magic phrase we are doing our best as fast as possible would allay the fears of a concerned citizenry.While the world has made great strides in dealing with racism, organized crime, gender inequality, and at the same time promoting diplomacy, Night of the Living Dead is still strangely relevant today as when it was first released. Perhaps our fears transcend time, rooted in memory and experience. In addition, Romero's film is also a strong rallying call for us to unite together to solve issues regardless of differences, petty or not. If there is such a thing as an educational horror film, that thing would be called Night of the Living Dead. It's not about zombies.

Since No End (1985) Kieslowski had worked with the screenwriter Krzysztof Piesiewicz and the score composer Zbigniew Preisner - and White is also made by this amazing trio. In Kieslowski's interview book he talks about him being Polish and his own situation which was very paradoxical; the Polish reality was repulsive and unapproachable but on the other hand he couldn't see himself living anywhere else. He always seemed to be going back there and he said that he could never get it off. While thinking about this one could see White as a very personal film for Kieslowski. The result of Polish reality is the (Polish) feeling of superiority, stress caused from the pressure of everyday, which can be seen as apathy, disability in emotional expressions and social withdrawal. These symptoms also valid as Kieslowski's description of the new free Poland.The first part in the Three Colors trilogy, Blue showed how freedom cannot be reached and the people who think they're free are usually the most far away from it. Only love can show the true nature of it. White continues this and questions the meaning of equality. As ís freedom so is equality an illusion - for Kieslowski. White is about a Polish barber, Karol who lives in France. His wife Dominique wants to get a divorce, because of Karol's disability to please her. In result of this Karol gets abandoned and returns to Warsaw, Poland. The new 'free' Poland is full of corruption, criminality, black market and money exchange. Enjoying the new capitalist country Karol gets himself quite a fortune and with it is able to get back at his ex-wife. In White Karol is in the exact same position where Blue's Julie was, because he still loves his wife. Kieslowski had said that No one can be equal, and no one actually wants to be equal, because someone always wants to be more equal than the other.The first film of the tricolor, Blue, was very dramatic, sad and ethereal. But White was a completely different film if looking at the genre and style. It of course dealt with similar kind of themes, and put its characters in same kind of positions, but the way Kieslowski approached the subject was very different. White was an ironic tragicomedy, much more down-to-earth than the almost dream likely Blue. On Kieslowski's caliber it was almost cheer, joyful and also might just had been his most personal film - it can be seen as an ironic self-portrayal. About a man who has got everything the West has to offer, but still feels powerless 'impotent' as a man who is in a wrong place does.The main theme in Kieslowski's whole production was the paradox of love and freedom. In The Three Colors tricolor this is even more obvious and important - it is the leading theme of the trilogy. A man isn't free and the least when he expects he is, love and freedom can never fit in the same relation. In Blue Julie tries to escape but has to come back because she is still in love - she cannot be independent and free. Kieslowski returns to this theme, love as a prison, in White. The scene where Karol and Dominique beckon to each other through the prison window. They both are trapped by love and can't be free as they can't be equal either.Three Colors White is about equality and the paradox of love and freedom. It's a portrayal of Kieslowski's own paradoxical situation. But it's also a very fine, comical description of the new capitalist Poland. Kieslowski didn't fall in front of the communist Poland and neither in front of the new Poland. Even that White isn't probably as beautiful as Blue and not as serious as Red it's a very talented ironic comedy, a tragicomedy actually. I found many touching scenes in it, and it works very well even just as a story.

Seeing it at the cinema as a child was an exhilarating experience. So, rewatching this movie again as part of a free to air network's Bond festival here in Australia was an exercise in nostalgia. It's great that the movie has held up all these years later for me. Having seen On her majesty's secret service recently, it's also great that this movie references it. That George Lazenby turn as James Bond is now my pick as the greatest Bond of all time, and now I can appreciate how this movie ties in with that one. Anyway, this is a very watchable and entertaining movie...it even teaches previous Bond movies how to make underwater scenes exciting! (cf. Thunderball). People with a nostalgia for the 1970s will also get a kick out of this movie, I think.Franchise clichésExotic locations - Spain, Italy, Greece.Plot -A covert ship with an A.T.A.C computer system (i.e. Automatic Targeting Attack Communicator) is attacked and the computer goes missing. ATAC launches Britain's submarine nuclear missiles and anyone who can get a hold of ATAC simultaneously neutralises Britain's nuclear deterrent as well as making Britain a target of its own missiles.Pre-title sequence -Maybe the first time I saw this movie I missed the first little part...where Bond is at a cemetery. Even if I hadn't of missed it, I would not have known of its significance. In any case, it's a lovely way to show continuity with Lazenby's turn as Bond...after the Connery outings pretended no one else had ever played Bond. Bond also battles a familiar looking character after that sequence. Due to legal reasons, I think, that character is uncredited. But again, it's a lovely tie in to Lazenby's one shot at playing Bond. There is a great symmetry between this movie and On her majesty's secret service. These two movies are my all time favourite Bond outings. That's a co-incidence - but a nice one - how they book-end each other.Theme song - Sheena Easton has one of the better Bond themes in this movie. For the first time in a Bond movie you can see the singer singing the theme song. Don't think that this has been replicated since...we'll see.Q - Check.M - He's missing in this movie. Moneypenny says that he is on leave. Lois Maxwell as Moneypenny is really showing her age too by now. Of course, you could say the same thing about Roger!Silly female character names - ?! This is the second time in my recent Bond reviews that I've drawn a blank in this category. Sexism\/misogyny - Bond is pretty celibate in this movie! One TV guide reviewer for this movie when it screened recently took umbrage at how Bond treated a figure skater. To me it was a sign that the franchise was realising that Moore was ageing and being the playboy was a harder sell than before.Wine snob - Bond takes the nuclear option as far as this goes!End teaser - Check.Things to look out for* the main reason I found this movie so exhilarating as a child had to do with the brilliant car chase sequence on winding European roads. I didn't see anything close to that until Australia's Mad Max 2 topped this film's car chase action. This Bond scene is remarkable for the fact that all this excitement takes place in a very non-standard Bond car! The skiing in this movie is exciting too, it must be said.* This movie is a masterclass in underwater filming. Whereas Thunderball was an overlong underwater travelogue with little tension - despite innumerable heroes and villains in the water - this movie doesn't endlessly drag out these scenes and creates real tension with a tiny fraction of the players of Thunderball. The earlier film is thus like George Lucas' Attack of the clones...lots of sound and fury signifying nothing. For once, less is a whole lot more.* ...so why did Melina leave her air tank underwater? Hmmm.* General Gogol pops up in a Bond movie once more, but only in passing.* You get some historical specificity in this movie...Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher is depicted, as is her husband. I found this sequence amusing, but it seems that it really grates for others. Perhaps they are English?* Hmm...there is some poor incidental music in the ski chase scene!* Melina Havelock is a pleasant reminder of Tilly Masterson, from my favourite Connery outing as Bond, Goldfinger.* Hmm...the final scene with Bond and Locque together seems quite dim on my TV.

Seeing it at the cinema as a child was an exhilarating experience. So, rewatching this movie again as part of a free to air network's Bond festival here in Australia was an exercise in nostalgia. It's great that the movie has held up all these years later for me. Having seen On her majesty's secret service recently, it's also great that this movie references it. That George Lazenby turn as James Bond is now my pick as the greatest Bond of all time, and now I can appreciate how this movie ties in with that one. Anyway, this is a very watchable and entertaining movie...it even teaches previous Bond movies how to make underwater scenes exciting! (cf. Thunderball). People with a nostalgia for the 1970s will also get a kick out of this movie, I think.Franchise clichésExotic locations - Spain, Italy, Greece.Plot -A covert ship with an A.T.A.C computer system (i.e. Automatic Targeting Attack Communicator) is attacked and the computer goes missing. ATAC launches Britain's submarine nuclear missiles and anyone who can get a hold of ATAC simultaneously neutralises Britain's nuclear deterrent as well as making Britain a target of its own missiles.Pre-title sequence -Maybe the first time I saw this movie I missed the first little part...where Bond is at a cemetery. Even if I hadn't of missed it, I would not have known of its significance. In any case, it's a lovely way to show continuity with Lazenby's turn as Bond...after the Connery outings pretended no one else had ever played Bond. Bond also battles a familiar looking character after that sequence. Due to legal reasons, I think, that character is uncredited. But again, it's a lovely tie in to Lazenby's one shot at playing Bond. There is a great symmetry between this movie and On her majesty's secret service. These two movies are my all time favourite Bond outings. That's a co-incidence - but a nice one - how they book-end each other.Theme song - Sheena Easton has one of the better Bond themes in this movie. For the first time in a Bond movie you can see the singer singing the theme song. Don't think that this has been replicated since...we'll see.Q - Check.M - He's missing in this movie. Moneypenny says that he is on leave. Lois Maxwell as Moneypenny is really showing her age too by now. Of course, you could say the same thing about Roger!Silly female character names - ?! This is the second time in my recent Bond reviews that I've drawn a blank in this category. Sexism\/misogyny - Bond is pretty celibate in this movie! One TV guide reviewer for this movie when it screened recently took umbrage at how Bond treated a figure skater. To me it was a sign that the franchise was realising that Moore was ageing and being the playboy was a harder sell than before.Wine snob - Bond takes the nuclear option as far as this goes!End teaser - Check.Things to look out for* the main reason I found this movie so exhilarating as a child had to do with the brilliant car chase sequence on winding European roads. I didn't see anything close to that until Australia's Mad Max 2 topped this film's car chase action. This Bond scene is remarkable for the fact that all this excitement takes place in a very non-standard Bond car! The skiing in this movie is exciting too, it must be said.* This movie is a masterclass in underwater filming. Whereas Thunderball was an overlong underwater travelogue with little tension - despite innumerable heroes and villains in the water - this movie doesn't endlessly drag out these scenes and creates real tension with a tiny fraction of the players of Thunderball. The earlier film is thus like George Lucas' Attack of the clones...lots of sound and fury signifying nothing. For once, less is a whole lot more.* ...so why did Melina leave her air tank underwater? Hmmm.* General Gogol pops up in a Bond movie once more, but only in passing.* You get some historical specificity in this movie...Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher is depicted, as is her husband. I found this sequence amusing, but it seems that it really grates for others.

It has the same strengths a plot based firmly in pulp history, some good action scenes, and a fairly serious tone. It also shares the same weaknesses dull direction and photography, rampant militarism, and clichéd dialogue.Kudos to the writers and producers and whoever for adding the political allegory. The Klingon Empire is collapsing due to a disaster of some sort, and it presents the Federation with a perfect opportunity, either to finally defeat their old enemies, or to turn over a new leaf and make friends. If you've seen The Next Generation, you'll know the outcome.The problem is that this is all rather tawdry. It turns out that the 23rd century is a lot like the present day, with politicians and military types and conferences everywhere you look. Remember the days when the Enterprise explored space and encountered exciting new alien life forms? None of that here. This is a much more old-fashioned adventure, with Kirk and Bones framed for assassinating the Klingon leader and shipped off to a prison planet while Spock and the gang try to solve the mystery of exactly what the heck happened.The middle third of the film moves slowly. The prison is full of aliens but otherwise a bit drab. The villain is not revealed as such until late, and doesn't get developed at all. The mystery is never as convincing as it should be because it always seems like Spock already has all the answers -- a technique Nicholas Meyer learned from old Sherlock Holmes films, though not from the genuine Holmes stories. Those stories are quoted along with an awful lot of Shakespeare; the Klingon in charge of the prison lifts his intro speech direct from Bridge on the River Kwai. The climax is pretty sharp, with a decent space battle. (Actually, the battle consists almost entirely of the Enterprise getting repeatedly shot at by a Klingon ship while Christopher Plummer spits out random Shakespearean one-liners; it's a wonder the scene works at all).So it's not a bad film, it just feels a little small. Galactic politics don't carry enough weight to make a really good movie, and there's not enough fun or adventure in the rest of the story. As usual, the unwieldy plot tends to crowd the characters out of the film, even though this, the last movie with the original crew, is where we really want to see each of our heroes get a good send-off.
