Do we actually judge it on the basis of the original characters and the original story line? Or do we judge it as a stand-alone completely independent of what we already know about the characters? Well, the fact that the name of the movie and the characters in it are based on some existing characters, then I guess I would prefer judging it based on what I know about the world as it exists in the original story lines! In that case, the movie is a perfect disappointment. None of what you know about the original characters strikes you when you see this movie. You see He-Man and you feel that for sure Dolph Lundgren is a nice selection but when you see him holding a laser gun in his hands and uses a hovercraft to move around, you know for sure that he is not the He-Man you read about in the comic books or admired as a child in the cartoons. No way! And it was a shock for me too. The last thing I expected to see in the motion picture based on He-Man and his world was to see these characters so weirdly dressed, using all kinds of gadgets that best belong to a Star War kind of a movie. There would have been one way of making this movie better. One could change the names of all the characters in the movie. This way, nobody would walk into the movie hall with expectations of this movie being about He-Man. I must confess at this point that I am not a geek in the sense that I have read and seen all there is about He-Man but at the same time I can assure I know enough to conclude that this movie definitely is not a good He-man movie. Well, now forgetting for a while that this movie is not to be judged based on the He-man universe, let us see how it stands out as a movie on its own. The special effects are decent and the story line is just about okay. The characters are not identifiable with and do not come with proper development. They are just there doing their role as the Alpha and the Omega. The story is okay in the sense that there is something in it and not pure action. There is a little plot. But again, it is not much deep. To sum it up, just see this movie once and forget about it. I don't think there is anything in the movie that would make you go back to it and see it again out of admiration.

I suppose to some it's one of those films that you specifically remember when you first heard about it; when you first saw it; where you were when your first saw it and what the circumstances were at that time. Given it has become so popular and so influential in its own retrospect with so many people having seen it so many times as individuals, it carries that sense of accomplishment and historical significance, perhaps not only on a level of cinema as a whole but to a culture &#150; to a generation of active filmgoers post 1994.I can remember first seeing Pulp Fiction &#150; the night before Halloween, 2003. I think up until that point I was naïve or immature when it came to cinema. Here was a film that gave me a prod; a wake up call to do with films as a whole. Here was a film that, I suppose, brainwashed me into a realisation that films didn't have to be progressive, linear, big on action and set pieces or of an entertainment value. To have Pulp Fiction take me through a roller-coaster ride of out of sync story telling (something I hadn't experienced in a film up until watching this); dialogue said by characters breaking down images of stereotypes; humour so black it has the power to make you put your hand over your mouth and shake your head in sheer embarrassment that you might find certain content even mildly amusing and just a continual flow of action, reaction and spontaneity that captivated me was a film experience I am wary I may never experience again.And while 2001 A Space Odyssey came close to delivering that same 'wow' experience about a year ago, you have to spare a thought for today's generation and their experience. Through certain websites that give you unlimited amounts of videos, you can instantly access all of Pulp Fiction's 'best bits' in a fragmented and spontaneous manner. I don't know how popular or well endowed certain video websites were back in late 2003, I didn't use the Internet as much back then, but I went into that initial Pulp Fiction viewing with absolutely no knowledge of any scene I was about to witness and came out someone who was suddenly into films; realised films could be different, almost experimental. I realised films could be influenced by previous ideas and these things called film 'movements' that were around decades before.So watching Pulp Fiction now recalls that first viewing and not the many after it, all of which were motivated perhaps out of feint hope I might be taken on that same, initial roller-coaster ride. Watching this film recently for the first time in about three years and having learnt and read a great deal more about the film and films that influenced it, it's no real surprise that I do feel it is one of the best ever made. Pulp Fiction taps into cinema of past years but reinvents and updates thus influencing a whole new brand of 'type', something evident in the late nineties but certainly now, in the new century. The manner in which the dialogue is delivered and the dialogue period seems less-so a gimmick with age than it did when it first came out. The manner in which director Tarantino audaciously flips from realism to escapism, often in one shot, is unheard of and best seen with Mia's visual 'square' imitation and the frequent title cards popping up to contradict the urban realism of everyday dialogue and long tracking shots of realistic people making their way through everyday locations.Pulp Fiction recalls a lot of Tarantino's work prior to Pulp Fiction. It begins in a diner (alá Reservoir Dogs and Natural Born Killers); contains characters whom are young, in love couples that enjoy killing people\/robbing places; contains Mexican standoffs (again alá Reservoir Dogs and Natural Born Killers) and carries that popular culture aura that just balances the film on that edge between realism and escapism in a way only Tarantino could at the time. Pulp Fiction is a postmodernist explosion of sorts; combing genres of romance, crime, gangster and comedy into one package. Characters plant seeds of doubt in the audience's minds ranging from a potential date with Mia (Thurman) to the menace that surrounds the character of Marsellus Wallace (Rhames) and what he might do when certain betrayals are made.One new thing I noticed when re-watching it recently was the manner in which Christopher Walken's character prior to his monologue 'hopes he (a young Butch) will never have to face a situation like that (in a POW camp) and take on certain responsibilities.' This echoes Butch's ultimate act of redemption that is to come in the sense he will be a prisoner (of war, I suppose) and will have to take on certain acts of responsibility in being a saviour all motivated through the want for the gold watch around which the story is entitled.Another item could be the way in which blatant violence is set up to be ignored for a bigger deal such as when a bystander is shot accidentally by Marsellus after a car crash (but the concentration is the chase after it) and a certain individual has his head blown off (but the concentration is the very bloody car interior and what they will now do). Pulp Fiction is essential viewing for anyone that even remotely considers themselves 'into' cinema. The European influence and contemporary referencing is second to none culminating in Pulp Fiction one of the greatest American films ever made.

Like the former, it details, in its far too brief 74 minutes, the life of an interesting American. Like the latter it gives a peek at a side of war that few see.

That thing which pushed Dengler to survive so much, and remain such a relatively upbeat man (although there are glimpses of darker sides), is what is at the center of this film, and all of Herzog's canon. Dieter Dengler's 'distant barbaric dream' of his past is fully ripened Herzog Country, and the use of a Madagascan chant, Oay Lahy E, during many jungle scenes, among other excellent touches in the score, show Herzog is, perhaps along with only Martin Scorsese, the best manipulator of image and music in film. Long may he merge!

And thanks to the concept of the movie, nor does the movie make you feel like sleeping with her unless of course you are foolish enough.The plot of the movie is loose. You have an alien who is a girl child. She explodes through the time line growing up really fast. Soon, she is old enough to copulate and reproduce. And there is a bunch of guys who want to make sure she does not reproduce for the simple reason that you do not want the earth to be full of alien kids. Now, in all her desperation to copulate you get to see Natasha's character with bare minimum clothing. And just you are getting in the mood she turns into her alien form and then does something that leaves a bloody mess. It takes away the whole mood. So, in the end neither do you have the scope to appreciate the depth of a character and neither do you have the will to dream about spending a good time with her!

I found the effort somewhat strained but I did like the views of Manhattan at night and the drive along Riverside Drive with the Upper West Side glowing in the background. Beyond the striking visual impressions, we have another Woody Allen take on the trials and tribulations of people, as they move in and out of relationships. This movie was written by Allen and shows his usual sardonic sense of humor as he portrays Isaac Davis, whose ex-wife Jill (Meryl Streep) has ''left me for another woman, as he puts it. This situation leaves Isaac even more humiliated. The male-baiting gives the movie some extra spark, particularly the hilarious accusation about Isaac's trying to run down Jill's new partner. Then there is Jill's pending book about their failed marriage, including their sex life, which he believes all his friends will be reading. The break-up is made worse by his loss of the custody of his child, who will now have to deal with two mothers, when one is enough of an albatross, as he puts it. Into the void, Isaac has struck up a serious friendship with a teenager named Tracy (Mariel Hemingway), who is twenty- five years younger. Mariel Hemingway is the essence of teenage innocence in this film and while we know she is much too young, we see her as a fragile presence who has helped Isaac get through the rough spots. He moves on to another woman named Mary (Diane Keaton) who has been abandoned by his friend Yale (Michael Murphy) who decides to go back to his wife. This leads to the awkward but funny situation of the two couples double-dating. Then Yale and Mary get back together again. Woody Allen has left us with a movie that has as much heart as humor.

As it was based on a Damon Runyon story, I expected irony and surprise, of which there was one really good one - when we find that Sinatra's gang has used the Salvation Army office for their crap game while Brando was in Havana with Simmons. If course it comes at the right moment too, when Brando brings her back. I really didn't expect much from Brando as a singer, but he surprised me. He wasn't great but he was just fine in the role. His big number in the sewer, however, with the rest of Sinatra's boys was the only place I felt Brando's voice was weak. He just didn't have the power the grand climax demanded. Overall I found the scenes between Brando and Simmons to be filled with electricity, something I didn't think would happen when we first see Simmons by herself, and later when we're introduced to Brando in the restaurant with Sinatra trying to pull a fast one on him. It wasn't until Brando goes to her office that the story came to life. Frank Sinatra, on the other hand, was flat, even his vocal performances. And Vivian Blaine, who I never heard of, but who I guess played the role on Broadway, just seemed to slow the proceedings down. The scenes between her and Sinatra were obvious. Also, her songs felt the weakest to me both in terms of advancing story or character. On top of that, all the Goldwyn Girls numbers seemed shoe horned in, just there for glitz. For example, when Frank meets with Brando in the nightclub, we just cut to the stage routine for the cat number - then it cuts back to the guys who continue on as if there hadn't been any dance number at all. Whenever Brando and Simmons were on screen, I was having a great time, but each time we return to the Sinatra-Blaine story, my interest level waned. As for the songs, there were some good ones, particularly the very first number with Stubby Kaye, the Fugue for Tinhorns number (Can Do!). That's a great song and it reminded me of the very first song in The Music Man - Cash for the Merchandise... whatever it's called. And the number in the sewer - I couldn't help but be reminded of Cool from West Side Story - which brings me to a point. I really did not like the art direction in this film. The fake Times Square was just so completely phony it drew attention to itself. Same for the Havana sequence, and particularly the sewer. I realize back in 1955 most musicals were shot on sets, but things were changing - Carousel, for example, made great use of location photography. Even On the Town shot scenes in Mahattan in 1949. By the time we get to West Side Story in 1961 it's a given that stuff taking place in Manhattan had to be actually shot in Manhattan. So by comparison, Guys and Dolls set-bound Manhattan felt dated and more than a little too cute. And changing Lindy's to Mindy's - did they really have to do that for legal reasons? Now, I always thought Guys and Dolls was a musical about Sinatra and Brando and their adventures with various girls. It was much more focused than that, which is to its credit. In that regard it is much better than Les Girls, which was interesting in it's own right, but had a certain shallowness to it. My one major complaint about Guys and Dolls, and I don't know if this is endemic to the original stage show, but when Jean Simmons realizes that Brando never took any money for a bet that he made with Sinatra and even said that he lost the bet, she just runs off to find him and we cut to the wedding. It seems to me a scene between Brando and Simmons would have added to the impact of the story. To see Brando come around as she came around to him would have been a great scene. There is such a scene in The Music Man (SPOILERS AHEAD), when Harold and Marion have that duet while he's waiting for her to change. She's upstairs in her house, he's down on the sidewalk. He's singing 76 Trombones. She's singing Goodnight My Someone. They suddenly switch and sing each other's songs - a beautiful way to convey their cross over to each other. It's an emotional high moment of the film. Still, Guys and Dolls had a lot going for it.

It wasn't until Brando goes to her office that the story came to life. Frank Sinatra, on the other hand, was flat, even his vocal performances. And Vivian Blaine, who I never heard of, but who I guess played the role on Broadway, just seemed to slow the proceedings down. The scenes between her and Sinatra were obvious. Also, her songs felt the weakest to me both in terms of advancing story or character. On top of that, all the Goldwyn Girls numbers seemed shoe horned in, just there for glitz. For example, when Frank meets with Brando in the nightclub, we just cut to the stage routine for the cat number - then it cuts back to the guys who continue on as if there hadn't been any dance number at all. Whenever Brando and Simmons were on screen, I was having a great time, but each time we return to the Sinatra-Blaine story, my interest level waned. As for the songs, there were some good ones, particularly the very first number with Stubby Kaye, the Fugue for Tinhorns number (Can Do!). That's a great song and it reminded me of the very first song in The Music Man - Cash for the Merchandise... whatever it's called. And the number in the sewer - I couldn't help but be reminded of Cool from West Side Story - which brings me to a point. I really did not like the art direction in this film. The fake Times Square was just so completely phony it drew attention to itself. Same for the Havana sequence, and particularly the sewer. I realize back in 1955 most musicals were shot on sets, but things were changing - Carousel, for example, made great use of location photography. Even On the Town shot scenes in Mahattan in 1949. By the time we get to West Side Story in 1961 it's a given that stuff taking place in Manhattan had to be actually shot in Manhattan. So by comparison, Guys and Dolls set-bound Manhattan felt dated and more than a little too cute. And changing Lindy's to Mindy's - did they really have to do that for legal reasons? Now, I always thought Guys and Dolls was a musical about Sinatra and Brando and their adventures with various girls. It was much more focused than that, which is to its credit. In that regard it is much better than Les Girls, which was interesting in it's own right, but had a certain shallowness to it. My one major complaint about Guys and Dolls, and I don't know if this is endemic to the original stage show, but when Jean Simmons realizes that Brando never took any money for a bet that he made with Sinatra and even said that he lost the bet, she just runs off to find him and we cut to the wedding. It seems to me a scene between Brando and Simmons would have added to the impact of the story. To see Brando come around as she came around to him would have been a great scene. There is such a scene in The Music Man (SPOILERS AHEAD), when Harold and Marion have that duet while he's waiting for her to change. She's upstairs in her house, he's down on the sidewalk. He's singing 76 Trombones. She's singing Goodnight My Someone. They suddenly switch and sing each other's songs - a beautiful way to convey their cross over to each other. It's an emotional high moment of the film. Still, Guys and Dolls had a lot going for it.

About a year and a half ago, after rediscovering Henson's famous Muppets, I decided to check out The Dark Crystal, and watch the entire thing from start to finish for probably the first time. Being a strong admirer of Henson (who sadly suffered a premature death when I was under four years old), I expected to like this project of his, but was disappointed and rather surprised when it turned out that I didn't like it at all! I soon gave it another try, but it wasn't much better. Finally, trying it one more time after this past year and a half or so, not much changed.The story is set on a planet called Thra, which has three suns; the Dying Sun, the Rose Sun, and the Great Sun. 1000 years ago on this planet, the Crystal of Truth, which was important to the well-being of Thra's inhabitants, was cracked, dividing the planet's inhabitants into two races; the good Mystics, and the evil, oppressive Skeksis! According to a prophecy, a member of the Gelfling race was to eventually revive the crystal and put an end to the Skeksis' regime, so the Skeksis attempted to wipe out the Gelflings! Jen is a Gelfling who has been raised by a Mystic, and thinks he's the only one left of his kind. As the one who raised him and educated him is dying, he sends Jen on a mission to find a crystal shard. The Gelfling is told that he can find this shard in Aughra's observatory. So, after his master dies, Jen sets out on the mission to find the shard and revive the crystal, but many challenges await! He must fulfill this prophecy in time for the next Great Conjunction of the three suns, or else the Skeksis will rule forever!All the characters in this film are puppets, there are no live actors, which is certainly not something I'm complaining about. Interesting concept, and it seems a live action movie without any actors appearing on screen had never been done before. However, too bad about certain other aspects of the movie. Where do I start? Well, one flaw in the film is some of the voice acting, including the voice provided for Jen, as well as the one for Kira, a female Gelfling who appears later in the film. If you ask me, voices in the film like those two are quite poor. The humour here is lacking. I found the Aughra character mildly amusing at times, but apart from that, I didn't laugh much. I also didn't find the story too intriguing for the most part, I guess it's a little too shallow and perhaps could have used a bit more focus. Pointing out the problems in the film, I certainly can't forget the characters. I didn't care much for many of them, and when scenes with the Skeksis came, for me, it was sort of like, Here we go again. Very boring villains. With some of the movie's flaws, there's something rather unprofessional about it.Henson was a very talented, creative individual, whose body of work continues to entertain people of different ages today, and it's so sad he had to come to a premature death in 1990, at age 53 (a few months before his 54th birthday), caused by pneumonia from a neglected infection.

It goes on, and on, and on.It's basically a 1-hour drama, that's been stretched into 3 by the simple expedient of drawing-out every detail. Unfortunately, most of them seem to exceed my attention-span, and I find myself constantly willing the thing to move on when instead it lingers, and lingers. On a face, on an expression, on a parting, on a re-union; every take is d-i-s-t-e-n-d-e-d as if in some kind of slow-motion celebration. Speeches are endless, verbose and largely uninformative. Revellations that could be made in a single line pour out as thickly and as gradually as cold molasses. This is exactly how I found Mr T's book.The bottom line of any story is this do we begin to care about the characters? Well, I certainly don't. I couldn't care a toss. They could all get swallowed-up by the evil-one with good luck and begone. And who needs to care about a wizard that is apparently immortal, but yet can't spot a double-cross from his own boss. Crikey; even I could see that one coming; it was Christopher Lee, for heaven's sake.There is no arguing with the splendid camera-work and lighting. Likewise the special-effects and CGI are surely beyond criticism. Real and imaginary landscapes blend in a seamless testament to back-room creativity. The idea of a tiny all-powerful trinket is also very intriguing. But the endless meetings, the endless goodbyes, the endless battles, the endless monologues, the implausible mood-swings, the maudlin sentimentality, the shocked, staring, angry, knowing, expressions that linger, linger on, gobbling-up the celluloid and the precious moments of my life, and the sheer tight-arsed-ness of a movie that takes itself more seriously than its viewers, ultimately breaks my heart and has me reaching for the coffee pot.Clearly, I am not a Tolkien fan. But I shouldn't have to be in order to enjoy this movie. Neither am I a fan of Alistair Maclean, but I still enjoyed 'Where Eagles Dare' & 'The Guns Of Navarone'.

Kim Hunter and Karl Malden are outstanding as Stella Kowalski and Mitch (both winning Oscars in the supporting roles). But the main genius comes from Vivien Leigh.Ever since a kid, I was astonished by her mesmerizing work in Gone with the Wind, but she's something else in this as Blanche Dubois. Without giving much detail away about her character, she's like the female version of Hamlet. Depressed, delusional, yet handsome and seductive. Her character remains a mystery, until the very end when things become clear. Her final revelations are sad and pitiful, yet can be sympathized by the audience.Besides the stellar performances, Tennessee Williams created a brilliant story about domestic life in Louisiana, which contains domestic violence, abuse, prostitution, sex, and related desires, hence the title A Streetcar Named Desire. It is understandable why this movie faced many censorship problems and perhaps this was the reason why it didn't get the Best Picture award; it was ahead of its time. By today's standards though, its themes are carried in about every other drama and television show.

The ultimate question is whether Ridley Scott's perfect vision is any good. I can emphatically say it has earned itself a place on the podium of the most extraordinary films ever.Set in a dystopian and perpetually raining Los Angeles during 2019, the story begins when five replicants escape onto the streets. Replicants are terrifying androids that are visually identical and superior to humans in every way. However, they do have a life span of four years and possess no memory, features which distinguish them from the genuine article. We then discover the lonely main protagonist of the story named Deckard, played convincingly by Harrison Ford, whose job is to eliminate these replicants.From here a dense noir thriller quickly evolves, fizzling from one visually stunning element to another. However, the best ingredient of this science fiction film is its wariness of not being too tedious by stuffing itself with sci-fi gibberish. Instead, it concentrates on absorbing themes, such as the question of identity or the value of being human.
