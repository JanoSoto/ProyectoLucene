","genre":"Drama, Romance, Sport"},{"date":"21 January 2007","score":"","review":" This film is an exploration of the inner thoughts, fears, desires and realities as opposed to our day-to-day exterior actions and appearance. Isabelle Hupert is masterful in showing a glimpse of these deep interior emotions while at the same time fighting with herself to overcompensate with her demeanor. The story, screenplay and directing is powerful. The classical music is good, but is not overused or central. It is an aspect of the protagonist which she uses to exercise her much needed control (a nice parallel to her overbearing mother's constant need of control).Benoit Magimel is also the right choice to uncover with the viewer the depth of Erika's character. He plays well against Isabelle and switches between love, lust, wonder, shock, affection, repulsion, intrigue, indifference and blind admiration.Michael Haneke makes interesting situations and great film moments. He uses his actors well and his love for the work is apparent. He goes further using sound (or lack thereof) as a powerful element and gets very close with his camera to really get us in the intense, interesting and mostly very human moments. He understands human nature and make us feel, wonder, understand. Jealousy, anger, love, lost, abandon, redemption, failure, self-hurt, all intertwined and expressed in many forms. The characters are all that more believable, flawed, fighting, trying and mostly failing. This is life.The story slowly, but successfully had me riveted and the situations constructed sometimes had me at the edge of my seat by their audacity, creativity and realism. The setup were so strong that the denouement could not live up to it and the scenes anticlimaxed once or twice where the intensity and extremeness could have been explored further. The only other qualm I have is that I found one important scene too static and overly long that could have been changed or edited out. This minor issue in the storytelling is easily forgiven and I am sure the director was trying to pace some deep desperation, confusion, (elation?) yet I found it did not exactly work.All in all a great provocative, thoughtful, memorable film.

How can a filmmaker combine his usual- by 96 usual anyway- with relationships that go up and down, end and start, and neuroses floating around like it's nothing, AND with the escapism of the musicals of the 30s and 40s that Allen obviously adores deeply? Somehow it all works pretty much to classic Allen effect, where there's a level of sharp wit, but there's also that added element of life being wonderful enough even when things seem at their lowest. The story goes into several directions, with a narrator (Natasha Lyonne) filling in the gaps of a family and their turbulent relationships. She D.J. Berlin, biological daughter of Joe (Allen), and technical step-daughter of Bob (Alda) who's married to Steffi (Goldie Hawn), her real mother. He lives in Paris, and on vacation Joe suddenly becomes involved with Von Sidell (Julia Roberts) after getting advice from DJ (she listens to all of her confessions to a psychiatrist through a wall) so he has all of the moves to make it the perfect relationship. Meanwhile, her sister Skylar (Barrymore) is engaged to Holden (Edward Norton), but things become complicated via parolee Charles Fery (Tim Roth). And meanwhile, DJ goes from man to man, almost getting engaged, and then falling for a guy in a Taxi Cab...And so on. All the while Allen injects the perfect whimsical tone and sweetness of all of those great, 'un-real' musicals of the Golden Age of Hollywood. Occasionally an actor might sing and not sound too right (aside from Barrymore, whom one can definitely tell a difference, they all sing their songs)- Roberts being one of them- but it's really amazing to see such talented actors have naturally apt ways into singing. And why not, after all, as many of us would love to just go right into a song we like on a dime.

","genre":"Action, Adventure, Thriller"},{"date":"21 January 2007","score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" I think Forman has been out of the movie business for so long that he's out of touch; he must have thought that the only available actresses or candidates to play a major female role were ugly, talentless whore widows of dead rock stars. I mean, how else can we explain the casting of Courtney Love (and what kind of a dumb name is that...? Her real name must be Deirdre Wiley)? The role of Flint's wife was a good role, and there are real actresses out there that should have been hired for the job. Not that she was bad - she was mediocre. And any of those so-called film-critics out there who thought her performance was terrific shouldn't forget two things 1) it's easy to make the audience feel sorry for a pathetic junkie HIV person, and 2) playing a pathetic whore junkie couldn't have been much of a stretch for her, now could it; this woman has built her whole career on being a dumb whore junkie.Another thing about Deirdre this nauseatingly ugly eight-foot-four monster has the kind of awful body that rapists would steer clear from; her legs and arms are bony in the most scary sense of the word, and her small, immobile silicon breasts aren't too much of a pretty sight, either. Her first scene in the movie - as a nearly underage stripper - is RIDICULOUS. She has the kind of body that wouldn't land her a job in the most run-down white-trash strip joints somewhere in the middle of Alabama. Plus, she doesn't look anything like an underage girl (or thereabouts) in that scene she looks like she's at least in her mid-twenties.As far as the film itself is concerned, the big question is just how truthful and unbiased Forman's portrayal of the characters and the allegedly true events really is. I really wouldn't know since I am not all-too familiar with Flint, apart from seeing him in the occasional interview, and the rumour (or fact) that he sodomized a chicken once. So how biased is it (the film, not the chicken)? Judging from Hollywood's past record on bias, the movie must be extremely one-sided, and more fiction than fact. (Nothing new there, unless you're a gullible fool.) The film's title itself already suggests whose side the film takes - making Larry Flint seem like a martyr - not to mention the fact that he was actively involved in the making of it (which included a cameo as a judge, where he lay rest to any hopes that he can act - if there were any such hopes among anyone).Having said that, I have absolutely no qualms about the film poking fun at organized religion (or any kind of religion, for that matter). One of the most amusing moments in the film is when Harrelson says 'no' when asked in court to swear to tell the truth, under oath. He explains that he is an atheist, so he can't do it. In fact, there is no doubt that the highlights of the film all lie in the scenes that take place in court; these scenes are humorous, and wonderfully ridicule the trials themselves, and the entire judicial system as a whole (the formality, the ludicrousness of it all).

Her first scene in the movie - as a nearly underage stripper - is RIDICULOUS. She has the kind of body that wouldn't land her a job in the most run-down white-trash strip joints somewhere in the middle of Alabama.

While we may want a better end to the saga, we still got a great one. Yes, it is not without its flaws, but they are few.Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) is now in his sixties. Age and wear have lead him to one thing; he knows and wants his corrupt business to become legitimate. He has lost his wife. His son wants nothing of the business, and he rarely sees his children anyway. While Michael is fighting for the legitimacy of his business, others are fighting against it. Vincent (Andy Garcia) is Michael's nephew. He is a very violent person; a person that is the main candidate to replace Michael as the future Don of the family. This is the sad story of one man's fight to redeem what he has taken, or lose it all over again in the process. The film co-stars Dian Keaton as Kay, who remains close to Michael for her children, but nothing more. Sofia Coppola plays Michael and Kay's daughter, Mary. Al Pacino is nothing short of brilliant in his final role as Michael Corleone. He is emotionally powerful. This was one of his best performances. Diane Keaton gives one of her best performances, as well. She loves Michael, but hates what he does. Andy Garcia does pretty good as Vincent.

After all, the president himself plans to re-allocate the CIA budget into health care! (How PC.) Hell, if the president really feels that way, then we'll (CIA) just have to blow up a couple of thousand of Americans, and pin it all on the Arabs... That'll teach him. Wow! This movie has the dumbest premise I have ever come across, and I've seen my share of bird-brained films! The plot is something right out of Libya's government newspapers' headlines. It's as though Ghaddafi himself was responsible for writing this garbage of a story. Trust Hollywood to get the good guys and the bad guys all wrong...While the movie's title bares no relevance to anything at all, my suggestion for a title is far more appropriate The Cat People. It seems that all of the main characters have nine lives here. The extras and the side-characters will all very humbly and obediently snuff it the moment they get shot, run over, or whatever.

I like how it took on the issue of vigilantism and the blurry line between the law and taking the law into your own hands. It was a very thoughtful concept and a very impressive working ground for this film to base itself on.The acting, secondly, was pretty good. I wouldn't say every actor gave a powerhouse performance, but Willem Dafoe absolutely MADE this movie. He really took over his role with body gestures, tone, and grace. The two brothers were OK at their roles, not great, but enough to do the job. Unlike most people, I really thought the guy who played Rocco did a great job too. He did overact sometimes, but looking back at when he's telling the joke to Yakavetta, he made that scene what it was.In addition to a solid acting performance, it was assisted by good writing. Call Troy Duffy whatever you want, but he wrote a very well rounded film that blended comedy, action, and emotion. Me and my friends use some of these lines on a daily basis now. This script really carried this movie more than anything else.The soundtrack and soundtrack were also impressive. The opening track, The Blood Of Cuchulainn, is one of my favorite songs, period.

Liev Schreiber, whom I liked in some previous movies, threatens to sink this movie single-handedly. He is designated here as comic relief. In order to compensate for his incredibly ridiculous character and the mediocre script Schreiber resorted to excessive mugging, which has the potential of irritating every single viewer. Fortunately, before he is given the chance to completely ruin the film, his character is killed off (about half-an-hour into the film). Thank God for that, I thought. However, he does reappear as a zombie about fifty minutes later in order to annoy us more with his unfunny comedy shtick. Minutes later he is killed as a zombie. Or so I thought. In the very last scene, quite predictably, he resurrects once again and gets the last word in the movie, thereby giving room for a sequel. How original. Schreiber is getting typecast recently as comic relief which is fine when the part and the script are good, but neither are in this case. Buscemi has been misused in a similar way as a very annoying, unfunny character in Armageddon.The director has mostly failed to create an exceptional horror mood which he was trying hard to achieve (or was he?). The easiest part where this could have been done was at the beginning when the two women arrive to the dead town. He has missed the opportunity to make this part of the movie highly atmospheric and eerie. (Andromeda Strain comes to mind, and how superior its dead-town scenes are to this movie's.) Instead, weak dialog soon creeps in, and a little later a badly miscast and talentless Affleck (and the supremely annoying Schreiber).The script is a mediocrity. The monster and the concept surrounding it are by and large derivative. Almost every monster shtick has been seen before. The most borrowing is from The Thing. Rose McGowan is a very pretty face to look at and it's a nice distraction from idiots Schreiber and Affleck. Seeing Peter O'Toole in a film of this sort is very strange. The motive isn't hard to guess; at one point his character says that he is writing for a magazine only for money.

And like almost every other thriller, this one has its share of idiotic moments (which come mostly in the obligatory grand finale).Firstly, there is no logic in Foster not telling the two cops at the door what the situation is and that they shouldn't get inside the house because her daughter's life is in jeopardy; after all, she knows that Yoakam and Whitaker can't hear the conversation. Secondly, why in hell would Foster's (ex)husband (who looks more like her grandfather when he first appears) be alarmed enough to call the police yet also be dumb enough to enter the house himself, before the cops arrive? Both of these things aren't entirely moronic or incredible, but the first has a dose of illogicality in it, while the second is a little far-fetched.However, there is nothing - and I mean nothing - that can excuse the incredible imbecility of my third example in the grand finale Yoakam gets hit by Foster on the head with a SLEDGEHAMMER, and then FALLS ALL THE WAY DOWN a couple of meters to the bottom floor. Yet what happens? Yoakam RISES FROM THE DEAD - or from THE UNCONSCIOUS, if you like - and walks around as if Foster merely scratched his face with her nails, and then proceeds to threaten Foster and her family once again. May I remind you at this point that neither Foster nor her daughter got a sledgehammer smashed onto their heads and yet Yoakam is in better shape than they are. Add to this the fact that Yoakam had previously had half of his hand crushed to bits by a steel door, and you've got a truly spectacular bit of idiotic writing. I truly can't get past this appallingly inane moment, and this is the main reason why I consider this movie to be slightly better than average - at best. It may be great for a thriller, but thrillers are generally so bad that it means nothing to say that this is a very good thriller. This sledgehammer\/Yoakam moment rates right up there with Fatal Attraction's bathtub\/Close moment and any major dumb De Palma moment.

He should seek out unusual scripts, the way he has done for his three previous films and stay away from standard fare; that kind of stuff (or crap) he should leave to the Van Sants and De Palmas of the film world.

From other sources, I've learnt that the only release of the 219-minute cut was in New York City, after which it was severely cut to 149 minutes. So, I guess I saw the shorter version first which, at the time, I thought, was a very interesting anti-Western, if a trifle confusing...So, it was with even more interest that I finally obtained a DVD of the full-length version. I'm glad I did because this second viewing has confirmed for me that the movie is a true classic, and the critical vitriol poured on Michael Cimino was unwarranted, to say the very least.Yes, it's a long movie, but so have been many others. For example Once upon a time in America (1984) at 227 minutes; Cleopatra (1963) at 320 minutes; The Ten Commandments (1956) at 220 minutes; Spartacus restored version (1960) at 198 minutes; Gone with the Wind (1939) at 222 minutes and others. So, it can't be the fact of running time that made so many froth at the mouth way back, when Heaven's Gate came on the scene.But note this all of those above movies have everything to do with reinforcing myths about history and heroes.Not so Heaven's Gate in this narrative, the American West is shown in all its grim and unrelenting harshness, injustice, and poverty. And that's probably the first reason why so many disliked this film it laid out the circumstances of the Johnson County War of 1892 in Wyoming, showing how the Wyoming Stock Growers Association hired 50 assassins to hunt down and murder a large group of European immigrants accused of cattle rustling; and all with the assistance and conniving of authorities, right up to the President of the United States. For an essay on that war, with the background and what happened, there is a link at Wikipedia under Johnson County War.Very few like to be reminded of the really dirty periods in their country's history, and which fly in the face of what the country is supposed to be. Had it been a documentary, it would have been barely palatable for most; as entertainment, it was almost bound to fail commercially and be torn to shreds by the shrill and infamous.Leaving aside the socio-political diatribe, for a moment, that Cimino launched herein, what about the narrative &#150; the story of the three main characters? Well, it probably wasn't unusual for men of that time to fall for a local prostitute, just as it's probably not unusual now. It's a fairly standard love triangle whereby Ella must choose between the two men, and ultimately decides upon the younger man, Nathan, who, although not above resorting to cold-blooded murder when it suits him, shows more spirit and commitment than the older James (or Jim, as most people in the film say). For some, that part of the story threads too slowly, perhaps; in the context of the wider narrative about the war, however, it is, I think, entirely appropriate.And that war is depicted graphically, viciously and cruelly with scenes of carnage that are exquisitely staged and edited flawlessly &#150; although in the final massacre between the Association and the immigrants, I'm certain that some scenes of wagons blowing apart are repeated. A minor point and perhaps brought about when the 219-minute cut was restored? Any way you look at it, though, it hits you in the face with the noise, dust, chaos and confusion of war...Which brings me to another criticism by others the noise and dust is such that it's often difficult to hear the dialog and even see clearly what is happening. I'll admit that I found that to be a trifle annoying at first, even backtracking to replay parts to try to catch the image or the words &#150; until I realized that really wasn't necessary if you accept the director's intent life is chaotic, it is difficult to hear and see in crowded situations and, in war, it's the sine qua non of this mise-en-scene. In short, it's as though you truly are present in and within the scenes...And what of the title? From Shakespeare, it refers to a figurative nearness to God and so, if you equate God with the natural world, the stunning scenery that pervades the movie &#150; and it is stunning, hauntingly equal to that of David Lean's Doctor Zhivago (1965) &#150; is a useful metaphor. I tend to think, however, that Cimino had something more to say, namely the idea that the brave immigrants &#150; the God-fearing salt of the earth &#150; were denied entry to heaven on earth and the freedom to build a life for themselves in the land that espouses to be freedom's champion.Was that Cimino's intent &#150; to gut the myth of the American West? To show how, in America, only the rich get rich while the poor are massacred, one way or another, throughout history? Is that anything new? Not really, as we all know. Where it really hurt, however, is in showing how America was not and, by implication, is not the land of the free and the home of the brave.

And that's probably the first reason why so many disliked this film it laid out the circumstances of the Johnson County War of 1892 in Wyoming, showing how the Wyoming Stock Growers Association hired 50 assassins to hunt down and murder a large group of European immigrants accused of cattle rustling; and all with the assistance and conniving of authorities, right up to the President of the United States. For an essay on that war, with the background and what happened, there is a link at Wikipedia under Johnson County War.Very few like to be reminded of the really dirty periods in their country's history, and which fly in the face of what the country is supposed to be. Had it been a documentary, it would have been barely palatable for most; as entertainment, it was almost bound to fail commercially and be torn to shreds by the shrill and infamous.Leaving aside the socio-political diatribe, for a moment, that Cimino launched herein, what about the narrative &#150; the story of the three main characters? Well, it probably wasn't unusual for men of that time to fall for a local prostitute, just as it's probably not unusual now. It's a fairly standard love triangle whereby Ella must choose between the two men, and ultimately decides upon the younger man, Nathan, who, although not above resorting to cold-blooded murder when it suits him, shows more spirit and commitment than the older James (or Jim, as most people in the film say). For some, that part of the story threads too slowly, perhaps; in the context of the wider narrative about the war, however, it is, I think, entirely appropriate.And that war is depicted graphically, viciously and cruelly with scenes of carnage that are exquisitely staged and edited flawlessly &#150; although in the final massacre between the Association and the immigrants, I'm certain that some scenes of wagons blowing apart are repeated. A minor point and perhaps brought about when the 219-minute cut was restored? Any way you look at it, though, it hits you in the face with the noise, dust, chaos and confusion of war...Which brings me to another criticism by others the noise and dust is such that it's often difficult to hear the dialog and even see clearly what is happening. I'll admit that I found that to be a trifle annoying at first, even backtracking to replay parts to try to catch the image or the words &#150; until I realized that really wasn't necessary if you accept the director's intent life is chaotic, it is difficult to hear and see in crowded situations and, in war, it's the sine qua non of this mise-en-scene. In short, it's as though you truly are present in and within the scenes...And what of the title? From Shakespeare, it refers to a figurative nearness to God and so, if you equate God with the natural world, the stunning scenery that pervades the movie &#150; and it is stunning, hauntingly equal to that of David Lean's Doctor Zhivago (1965) &#150; is a useful metaphor. I tend to think, however, that Cimino had something more to say, namely the idea that the brave immigrants &#150; the God-fearing salt of the earth &#150; were denied entry to heaven on earth and the freedom to build a life for themselves in the land that espouses to be freedom's champion.Was that Cimino's intent &#150; to gut the myth of the American West? To show how, in America, only the rich get rich while the poor are massacred, one way or another, throughout history? Is that anything new? Not really, as we all know. Where it really hurt, however, is in showing how America was not and, by implication, is not the land of the free and the home of the brave. Instead, after absorbing this narrative, we are left with an impression that the underpinnings of America have more to do with a land of dispossessed slaves and a home for knaves...

It has the violence and testosterone-driven grit and Cockney linguistics of an English gangster movie, but it's emotionally driven story and the deeply felt inner softy in the outwardly angry, husky Bob Hoskins character make it different. As a love story, it's not for one second a boy-meets-girl, boy-loses-girl, boy-gets-girl yarn. It's much more complex and goes in a much different direction. I like that about Mona Lisa. Jordan makes the film very offbeat by making it very personal, which he does every film he makes. He closes in on a character's emotional motives and inner battles.Bob Hoskins leads the very realistic cast with his powerful performance, not quite as intense or charismatic but just as interesting and different as he was in The Long Good Friday. Michael Caine, as he always has and always will be, is the highlight of the cast though. No matter how charming he is or how much presence he has to make the audience yearn for his time on screen, he still portrays a ruthless crime boss that we hate for Hoskins's sake. His half-closed eyes and spread lips during a scene when he loses his temper make him an almost bullying figure that must get his comeuppance.Mona Lisa, aside from its rushed and perplexingly tacked on ending, is a decent contribution to the English crime genre, coming from a very individual approach.

It's just another dull, predictable, seen-it-all-before Alien re-hash. Even the creatures look like the Alien monsters, except that they have wings.I mean, here we have a ship crash-landing on a planet with three suns (now there's some real unscience-like nonsense, but okay it's just a movie) and one might be forgiven to hope that maybe something unique and original will happen story-wise. But no. The survivors are threatened by bat-like creatures who suck blood. YAWN! The rest of the movie is about how the ten little crash-landers try to survive the onslaught of the totally uninteresting flying alien draculas. The first half-hour or so is not even that bad (though hardly super), but once this movie's raison-d'etre materializes in the form of little Aliens, it was strictly sleepy-time for me.The movie isn't even visually exceptional. The dialog is your standard crap; sly\/cool one-liners mouthed by characters created by a PC visionary; the last four to remain alive are two females and two black guys. Need I say more? The blonde is supposed to be some kind of Sigourney Weaver toughy who is more than a match for many men, while the main Anglo-Saxon male turns out to be both corrupt and weak (he's a dope-addict). All the while, the mass killer, with his deep booming voice, is Vin Diesel who isn't such a bad guy after all, and even has his heart-of-gold won over eventually by the blonde to the extent that he risks his life to save people who normally\/logically he shouldn't care less about (or would kill, right?

The continuity of the blonde's character is also faulty at the outset, she very willingly wants to sacrifice dozens of people to save her own heiny, but by the end of the movie she is prepared to give her life for just two.

Their father is a Presbyterian minister, and the two sons, Paul and Norman, take very different paths in life. Norman, dubbed the preacher by his buddies, is a serious, steady, man- he marries and becomes an English professor. Paul, on the other hand, feels the need to rebel against his stern Presbyterian upbringing. He's a risk taker, and he likes to have a good time. As the story unfolds, he dives deeper into drinking and gambling.One of the main themes in the movie is fly fishing, which is brought up again and again. As Norman says in narration, In my family, there is no clear division between religion and fly fishing. The boys learn the skill from their father, and it remains one of the things that binds the men together throughout their lives. Paul makes it an art form, fishing with so much grace that his brother is awed. Many metaphors for life are shown through their family fishing trips.Just as Norman's life is taking shape- he gets a job offer from the University of Chicago and proposes to his girlfriend- Paul finally spirals out of control, which was admittedly a long time coming. Despite Paul's tumultuous life and violent end, his father and brother hold a deep and abiding love for him. At the end of the movie, the Rev.
