The publicity generated six decades ago certainly seems to have finally dissipated to the degree that now allows for an evaluation of the Howard Hughes project; without getting hung up on the appearance and specially constructed shaping garment, allegedly designed by Hughes himself, to exhibit the most ample, hyped and stylish mammaries in film history.(Up to that point anyway!)WHATEVER Mr. Hughes' talents were, it was never suggested that his abilities as a Movie Director should be included in his resume. Perhaps we are not being truly fair in this evaluation; our assessment being warped by our looking through the prism of all the years of publicity (mostly unwanted) of Howard Hughes the Oilman, the Aviator, the Airline Mogul and Aircraft Designer as well as his well publicized affairs with so many women in Hollywood. Lastly, we are well indoctrinated with tales of Howard Hughes, the billionaire recluse, the employer of men of Mormon Faith, Hughes the weirdo. MAKING a valiant attempt to see his rather limited Directorial output through clear lenses and minus any of that negative prejudice, we see a much different picture. If one has trouble accomplishing this, the same objective can be achieved simply by pretending that his work is the product of another, lesser luminary in the field of film direction.THE total number of movies bearing the Hughes name in the Director's chair being precious few; it is not a long or difficult task to do your own Howard Hughes Festival or retrospective. The Hughes-directed titles are limited to three (3) measly films; but what a glorious troika they make. They are chronologically (and in order of their production*) the World War I aviation extravaganza, HELL'S ANGELS (Caddo Company\/United Artists, 1930), the Al Capone-like SCARFACE (Caddo Company\/United Artists, 1932); in which Mr. Hughes shares directorial credit with one Richard Rosson.AS for our honoree of the day, THE OUTLAW (Howard Hughes, 1943; Howard Hughes\/United Artists, 1946;Howard Hughes\/RKO Radio Pictures, 1949), we found it to a sort of atypical Western romp. Oddly enough and flying in the face of all we had heard and read, we enjoyed it and feel that the movie is certainly much better than expected.UNLIKE most Western Movies, OUTLAW is low on action with the Gunplay being held down to a minimum and the horse racing around the huge boulders of her Ray Corrigan's Ranch or the multitude of natural wonders in Monument Valley, in the Utah & Arizona Desert . Everything was done either in the Studio or on its back. THE STUDIO filming of the indoor scenes, and there seems to be many in comparison to the outdoor sequences, tight space even claustrophobic feelings are pervasive throughout; rendering it a virtual antithesis of the usual Western Saga as done by men such as John Ford. While this may well seem at first to run contrary to what one's concept of a Horse Opera should be, let's stop and reconsider for after all some of the very best and most renowned Oaters were considered offbeat and highly atypical of the Genre. Yet, titles such as HIGH NOON and SHANE are valued as true works of the Cinematic Art.THIS Studio Soundstage filming and minimally used shoot-em-ups and gallop-fests were certainly not due to Hughes' being tight fisted with the cold ca$h; for one glance at the cast will surely be highly influential in changing one's mind in that respect. Producer-Director Hughes certainly spared no expense in bringing the very top talent into the project.STARTING with the cast, we have newcomers Jack Buetel, as Billy the Kid, in the title role and (Woo, woo, woo, woo!) a youthful and unbelievably beautiful Jane Russell as Rio McDonald, kind of a shady lady (more implied than stated). The film's cast is graced with the presence of two of the fine and preeminent Actors of that or any other era. Walter Huston as Doc Holiday and Thomas Mitchell as Sheriff Pat Garrett both sparkle in their roles and have managed to carry along the considerable amount of dialogue that is presented in the screen play. There isn't even one Yup or Nope to be heard throughout.THE CAST is further complemented by the inclusion of such dependable supporting character actors such as Joe Sawyer, Emory Parnell, William Newell, Ethan Laidlaw, Julian Rivero and William Steele. Looking closely will reveal that young Dickie Jones and a youthful Ben Johnson making the most of some unbilled assignments.ONE THING that THE OUTLAW does accomplish with a suma cum laude grade on its report card is its depth of character development. Each part is fully explored and made into something much more than a caricature of what a Westerner should be. Howard goes to an extreme, with the story & screenplay done by Jules Furthman, Howard Hawks & Ben Hecht, and delivers people we truly care about.WE MUST CONFESS, both Schultz and I really liked it and must give it a **** Rating.NOTE * We know that we were being redundant with that chronologically and in order of their production business.

I found myself in awe when I watched the Starships fly around on screen and engage each other in heated combat. This is something which I do not feel when I look at computer generated effects of modern movies. When I observed the ships in this film, I actually felt like I was looking at what could have been a real ship in space; whereas when I observe more modern productions I think to myself yes, this is nice and although it looks pretty impressive, it just doesn't feel real to me. I think this because the ships in newer productions have that all too fluid and smooth movement which is indicative of computer generated models, so that artificial feeling is always there and pinging at me in the back of my mind. As such, it just doesn't convince me as a viewer that I am observing something that could actually exist; it feels like it is fabricated and fake to me. The ships in The wrath of Khan were actually huge models that were masterfully built and detailed by hand and then shot by a real life camera. Very little computer assistance was used in bringing them to life on the big screen. This is just something that is not done very often anymore and it is becoming a lost art. I think the older films, where this technique was implemented and perfected, were the better for it over their modern computer driven counterparts.The story in this movie was also well written. In particular I very much enjoyed the quoting of Moby Dick by Khan; both when he first sets out after Kirk and when he has lost the battle but still intends the win the war in the Nebula by destroying his ship with the super weapon the Genesis Torpedo. The character of Khan mirrored the very character he was quoting, Captain Ahab, in many ways; particularly in that his quest for vengeance against the white whale (Kirk) had totally consumed him.Furthermore, it can not be quarreled that Ricardo Montalban was a phenomenal actor, and he brought true passion and anger to his role as the revenge obsessed Khan Noonien Singh; a super-human genetically engineered to be superior to ordinary man in all ways possible. At least, this was how he perceived himself in his own mind.Throughout the movie, Khan was easily angered and provoked; particularly when Admiral Kirk insulted his superior intellect, injuring his enormous pride. This encounter, which he was so easily manipulated into, turned out to be fatal for the vengeful Khan and his crew. Also worth noting is that while the character has a warped sense of morality, he still yet had feelings for members of his crew. This was apparent when his helmsman was killed and he yet again vowed vengeance against Kirk. It seemed that the character's primary motivations were his intense desires and passions, thus making him a being in constant conflict with himself as his emotions overruled the better judgments of his vast intellect.This movie ended on a particularly sad note when one of the most beloved of the main characters (Spock) sacrificed himself for the good of all to save the Starship Enterprise and her crew from the final mad act of vengeance of the enraged Khan. While saddened by this, I greatly respected the lesson behind the ending of the movie in that putting the well being of others before your own is critical for the bettering (or in this case the survival) of all. To quote Spock the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few, or the one. That was one of my favorite movie quotes of all time.In conclusion, Star Trek II The wrath of Khan was my favorite installment of this long running franchise. I loved the special effects, the acting was superb (particularly Ricardo Montalban's performance) and the story was enthralling and entertaining. If you are a fan of science fiction movies and thrillers, such as I, then this is a phenomenal movie for you. If nothing else, catch it on cable or satellite once and give it a go. Try watching the special effects and pay particular attention to how the space ships in this movie are portrayed. Compare the use of actual models to a newer movie or series that uses computer generated models and see which type is more convincing to you. Speaking for myself, there is no comparison. Real life models are by far and away my preferred method of creating convincing special effects. Perhaps one day computer technology will advance to the point where I will change my mind; but as of 2009 I feel the technique still has a long way to go before it can outperform movies such as this.

This encounter, which he was so easily manipulated into, turned out to be fatal for the vengeful Khan and his crew. Also worth noting is that while the character has a warped sense of morality, he still yet had feelings for members of his crew. This was apparent when his helmsman was killed and he yet again vowed vengeance against Kirk. It seemed that the character's primary motivations were his intense desires and passions, thus making him a being in constant conflict with himself as his emotions overruled the better judgments of his vast intellect.This movie ended on a particularly sad note when one of the most beloved of the main characters (Spock) sacrificed himself for the good of all to save the Starship Enterprise and her crew from the final mad act of vengeance of the enraged Khan. While saddened by this, I greatly respected the lesson behind the ending of the movie in that putting the well being of others before your own is critical for the bettering (or in this case the survival) of all. To quote Spock the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few, or the one. That was one of my favorite movie quotes of all time.In conclusion, Star Trek II The wrath of Khan was my favorite installment of this long running franchise. I loved the special effects, the acting was superb (particularly Ricardo Montalban's performance) and the story was enthralling and entertaining. If you are a fan of science fiction movies and thrillers, such as I, then this is a phenomenal movie for you. If nothing else, catch it on cable or satellite once and give it a go. Try watching the special effects and pay particular attention to how the space ships in this movie are portrayed. Compare the use of actual models to a newer movie or series that uses computer generated models and see which type is more convincing to you. Speaking for myself, there is no comparison. Real life models are by far and away my preferred method of creating convincing special effects. Perhaps one day computer technology will advance to the point where I will change my mind; but as of 2009 I feel the technique still has a long way to go before it can outperform movies such as this. A movie, I might add, which was made over two and a half decades ago at the time of writing this review.

Now I am NOT saying it's THE worst film ever--but if you look at a ratio of cost over how much an average person would enjoy it, this is a very, very bad film.I would say that the single biggest factor making this a bad film is the writer\/director, Michael Cimino. Rarely can so much blame be placed on a single person. Had he not been so self-indulgent, a film just as bad could have easily been made at about 90 minutes--saving the studio millions! The film begins with a completely unnecessary prologue that's supposed to be set at Harvard. The scene is HUGE but completely without context. You have no idea exactly what is occurring nor do you know why the students (in particular, John Hurt) are behaving so boorishly. I find it very hard to imagine a commencement going like this in 1870--and it looks a lot more like 1970. This is a half hour where you have no idea what is happening, who the characters are or their motivations. The next scene is 20 years later. Inexplicably, the two Harvard grads (Hurt and Kris Kristofferson) are in Wyoming. So, they went to the best school in America and now one is only a law man in the middle of no where and the other is....well, what IS John Hurt in the film?!?! He just appears here and there and seems to be either a jerk (the prologue) or a pathetic and pointless drunk who hangs out with murderers--even though he is apparently against them!? His entire character made no sense. They never explained why he was a Brit living in the middle of nowhere (it was impossible to hide his accent), why he bothered to come along with the hired army IF he was so against their wicked plan nor why he would risk his life for a cause he didn't believe in at all. As for Kristofferson, his excellent acting and better defined character made his character more believable, though having him move to Wyoming AND risk his life for a prostitute made no sense at all.This brings up the worst aspect of HEAVEN'S GATE. While the scenes are WAY TOO LONG and needed trimming, the worst part of the film is that the characters were like cardboard. John Hurt (a wonderful actor with nothing to do in the film), Jeff Bridges and many other big names are there but you have no idea why. In fact, other than Kristofferson, Isabelle Huppert (as a hooker with a heart of gold--quite the cliché) and perhaps Christopher Walken, EVERYONE is completely one-dimensional. It's hard to imagine a movie THIS long where you don't know or understand the characters. Much of the film also seems anachronistic. Who would have thought to have a giant roller rink constructed in the middle of no where in 1890? I am sure that just getting the basic supplies in this region in the West would have been very, very difficult--and yet we are expected to believe that trains filled with roller skates and lumber arrived instead of FOOD. Maybe if they hadn't spent a bazillion dollars building and frequenting the roller rink, the farmers could have afforded to BUY food and avoided this war over purloined cattle!!! And what's with the guy on roller skates with the fiddle? What did this have to do with a land war? The most obvious problem you are left with is that it's a film where very, very little actually happens until the big battle late in the film. There are lots of scenes of filth and flat nothingness. So much nothingness that by the time the battle occurs, many audience members would have left or are now so hostile to the film that it's inevitable that nothing could salvage the film.As for the final battle, it was done reasonably well but had problems. First, this minor skirmish on the prairie lasted longer than the D-Day invasion!! Second, while details of the actual events of the so-called Johnson County War are a tad sketchy, we do know that the characters played by Huppert and Kristofferson never actually were there, as they'd both been hung BEFORE the battle. Third, I can't believe that Cimino actually killed animals throughout the film--especially during the final battle. While I am far from a bleeding heart about animal rights, his need to use animal guts and actually kill some of the horses is a low point in cinematic history. Watching and knowing that some of the horses died to achieve Cimino's vision for the film is very sad.Finally, after the big battle, we have an epilogue. While it is blessedly short, it also seemed completely unnecessary and vague. We see Kristofferson on a fancy yacht, so we can assume that he's finally putting some of that Harvard education to work for himself. We also see a woman who appears to be one that Kris looked at a couple times during the prologue. Most importantly, nothing is said and you have no idea what the final outcome. I read up on it myself and found that the film often got the facts wrong.Overall, to say the film is long and needed tons more editing was like saying WWII was a minor tiff. Well, I've certainly seen a lot worse, but if you factor in the cost of production, I truly think it might just be one of the worst films in history.Finally, when a film has this much explicit nudity I warn parents. However, as no child COULD sit through this film (even with a promise of sex), the warning is not necessary.

He seems to be getting somewhere when a fellow veteran lays out a story for him. That is about all I can say without giving to much away, it is though a rather interesting movie and I really had know idea where it was going, though the ending did make sense and you will probably go that makes sense.

Demi Moore delivers one of the best performances of her career in one of those remarkably physically demanding roles for which men are applauded and women - should another dare to take on such a role after the flak Moore received - are often ridiculed. In the hands of a less talented actress her toughness and imposing physique might become male-impersonation clichés - see Vasquez in Aliens - but Moore remains utterly feminine throughout.The training sequences of which much of the film is comprised are all handled well and never outstay their welcome or become repetitive, and even when they stretch credibility - as in the punishingly violent sequence where Moore is outright attacked - it's hugely satisfying dramatically when you consider the attacker's motives. Things become very silly and highly implausible once a training mission turns into the real thing, but it remains enjoyable. It may feel like it was tacked on from a different movie but few chop-shop efforts work so well. It bears discussion too it raises very serious questions about women in combat, and is deceptively balanced in the time it gives both sides of the argument - even if you have to use your brain to spot the anti moments. Sure women can do it, but should they be allowed to? During her brutal interrogation the men crack. Would they have done so if a man had been suffering? It offers no answers, it's just happy to present Moore's story without calling anyone villains.It's not all great though. It's filmed in a slightly annoying style that seems determined not to make any use of the widescreen format, but that's fairly typical of the Scott brothers so I can't say it was unexpected. Also the supporting characters are often straight out of a cartoon.Overall it's an exciting story, well executed, and blessed with a fine central performance that ensures every blow and setback the likable heroine suffers is felt by the audience, and every triumph celebrated.

It gives the viewers a great insight in on the difference between good and evil, even though the good is portrayed as an outlaw or bad guy. I enjoyed the film very much, with the sound\/music, colors and editing of the film, I found myself not only intrigued by the noble acts that Robin Hood performs but the love story behind the storyline was very interesting as well.Almost throughout the whole film, the music seemed to be upbeat and sets the mood of excitement. The music that is played throughout the film is what people think of when they think back to this certain time period with knights and kings. Even though the characters are battling to the death the loud trumpets and flutes help to excite the audience with what is happening in that particular part of the film. Even when Robin Hood was being captured at the archery contest, the background music was still very upbeat, at least until he gets caught and thrown in the dungeon.The colors and costumes are both very bright and dull depending on which group of people are being viewed at that time. When looking at the Norman who are all of high stature, they wore clothing with very bright colors and there seem to be a lot of purple which is the color of royalty. I also noticed that the highest in rank for the Normans like Prince John wore gloves, even when he ate at the beginning of the film. What I got out of this is that other men that are not of his stature to do not deserve the right to touch his hand. On the other hand, the Saxons wore dull and earthier colors which makes sense since they are residing in Sharewood Forrest. Even though Robin Hood is of noble status, he also wears the tights with a dull green cloth which makes him seem more like a part of the Saxon poor that are being mistreated and it give the audience a sense of he does not what to show off his status and makes him seem understanding of the Saxon people. Throughout the movie the color red seems to portray the villains and green is the color of the outlaws fighting for the rights of the Saxon people. In one particular scene, there is a battle between Robin Hood and Sir Guy. In this confrontation, Sir Guy is wearing very bright red and of course Robin Hood is in green, this scene basically outlines what the audience sees with the colors between the good and bad.I thought the editing of the film was very good, there may have been some parts where you could tell that they were either used on a set like when Robin Hood is being chased by some guards in the forest and he turns around to shoot an arrow at them, that particular cut is easy to see that it was shot on a set. But with the technology they had in the 1930s, it was probably the best editing that they had available. In the beginning with Prince John finds out that his brother King Richard has been captured during the crusades, he goes to have a drink of wine with Sir Guy. Prince John spills his red wine and the camera makes a slow transition to focus on the spilled drink on the floor which looks like blood. I interpreted this as maybe a foreshadow of many deaths on the account that King Richard has been captured. In the scene when Robin Hood has gathered all the Saxons and is giving a speech he talks about how they have been treated and the camera is flowing across the crowed and a man wearing an eye patch comes into view and immediately after Robin Hood talks about the Saxons being blinded with hot irons. This scene was edited to give a good example of how the Saxons are being treated with a visual image and in turn the audience should feel compassion for the innocent people that are being mistreated. Another editing technique that the director uses is shadows of the characters against some giant wall. This is used at least twice, and I think the director wants the audience to feel a bit of excitement because they can't actually see the characters and is it's harder to tell exactly what is happening at that particular time. The final effect of editing in this film that I noticed was that Maid Marian is covered up except for the front of her face and it is hard to get a good view of her. In one scene in the film her whole head is uncovered and her hair is down, during this scene she finally admits that she has feeling for Robin Hood. I think that the director planned this to make it as a coming out for Maid Marian with showing her face and admitting her feeling for Robin Hood.Overall I really thought this is a great film. Even though there is death and violence, it had a lot of comical relief with Little John and all the merry men always laughing and having a good time and the music being rather upbeat even thought they are among a very trying time between the Saxons and Normans.

And the thing is, everything that happened in Enemy of the State is very, very possible of happening. But that's just me thinking, 'cause it was over 11 years ago and and I couldn't remember if I tried. Did this movie do the same thing to the government as Jaws did to the beaches? Perhaps.The movie is about a highly accomplished lawyer named Robert Clayton Dean played by Will Smith in the performance of his career and makes an extremely believable character and expresses his emotions of anger and paranoia just perfectly. Dean accidentally gets a videotape of a covered-up political murder and in most of the movie, he doesn't realize it. But he's aware that the people (NSA agents) chasing him are watching him for sinister purposes. Robert Dean is also one of the smartest characters in the history of films, as he is able to outsmart a corrupt agency who have practically everything on him, such as satellites, tracers and cameras.Gene Hackman also stands out as the gruff, foul-mouthed former conspirer and government agent named Brill, who has had experience in surveillance technology and assists Dean in getting away from these dirty agents. However, Hackman doesn't show up until after the first hour, but that demonstrates his character who has spent most of his life hiding and it shows the secretiveness of Brill. Although the role is somewhat smaller, Hackman makes the best of it.And as for the NSA agents played by Jon Voight, Barry Pepper, Seth Green and Jack Black.....all of these guys are DIRTY, and I mean that in the truest meaning possible. These guys are ruining an innocent man's life, screwing up his credit cards, and even wrecking his marriage just so they can get away with what they did. Believe me, you are gonna find yourself HATING these guys, and I mean it. And as movie villains go....you're supposed to hate them, sometimes in other movies, you might be amused or not feel anything at all, but Enemy of the State does what it's supposed to do. Also, they're very realistic 'cause they aren't stupid and they know what they're doing with all the technology they have.Most of the film's thrills comes from the suspense rather than the action, as much of Tony Scott's films are like. The chase scenes such as the beginning when the NSA guys are going after Zavitz and when they're chasing Dean in the hotel and on the streets are terrificly shot and edited. Also, later on the action comes in after Dean and Brill run from the agents is also a highlight, and it's pretty hilarious after Dean asks Brill why he blew up the building and he reacts by saying Because you made a phone call! which demonstrates how careful he is.

And the thing is, everything that happened in Enemy of the State is very, very possible of happening. But that's just me thinking, 'cause it was over 11 years ago and and I couldn't remember if I tried. Did this movie do the same thing to the government as Jaws did to the beaches? Perhaps.The movie is about a highly accomplished lawyer named Robert Clayton Dean played by Will Smith in the performance of his career and makes an extremely believable character and expresses his emotions of anger and paranoia just perfectly. Dean accidentally gets a videotape of a covered-up political murder and in most of the movie, he doesn't realize it. But he's aware that the people (NSA agents) chasing him are watching him for sinister purposes. Robert Dean is also one of the smartest characters in the history of films, as he is able to outsmart a corrupt agency who have practically everything on him, such as satellites, tracers and cameras.Gene Hackman also stands out as the gruff, foul-mouthed former conspirer and government agent named Brill, who has had experience in surveillance technology and assists Dean in getting away from these dirty agents. However, Hackman doesn't show up until after the first hour, but that demonstrates his character who has spent most of his life hiding and it shows the secretiveness of Brill. Although the role is somewhat smaller, Hackman makes the best of it.And as for the NSA agents played by Jon Voight, Barry Pepper, Seth Green and Jack Black.....all of these guys are DIRTY, and I mean that in the truest meaning possible. These guys are ruining an innocent man's life, screwing up his credit cards, and even wrecking his marriage just so they can get away with what they did. Believe me, you are gonna find yourself HATING these guys, and I mean it. And as movie villains go....you're supposed to hate them, sometimes in other movies, you might be amused or not feel anything at all, but Enemy of the State does what it's supposed to do. Also, they're very realistic 'cause they aren't stupid and they know what they're doing with all the technology they have.Most of the film's thrills comes from the suspense rather than the action, as much of Tony Scott's films are like. The chase scenes such as the beginning when the NSA guys are going after Zavitz and when they're chasing Dean in the hotel and on the streets are terrificly shot and edited. Also, later on the action comes in after Dean and Brill run from the agents is also a highlight, and it's pretty hilarious after Dean asks Brill why he blew up the building and he reacts by saying Because you made a phone call! which demonstrates how careful he is.

The shot is linked to the next scene that takes place on ground level of the station, that being a pouring out of emotions that happens when several people partake in dictating letters to a woman they've never met but entrust to write down what they've said before mailing them off to the chosen address' of loved ones. Just in the opening, director Walter Salles foretells the spilling out of emotion the characters will go through in this film whilst, some might argue, bringing to attention the illiteracy problem that he believes plagues his native Brazil. The opening also goes a long way in establishing the protagonist of the film, a certain Dora (Montenegro), and how she is 'before' the film develops her.Central Station is, essentially, a road movie but it is one of the better road movies that I have ever seen. It is a humbling and thoroughly interesting piece that studies two people of binary oppositions in a situation that consistently pushes weight down on top of a delicate mindset that is possessed by the protagonist. As a character, Dora is initially unlikable. She spends her days writing out letters dictated to her by illiterate people but rarely posts them to their respective addresses. She is friendless, bar a loose woman named Irene (Pêra) whom visits from the apartment downstairs, and does not have any family or pets. But what makes Central Station so memorable is the gradual changes Dora undergoes in order to become a better person and this is accomplished through the time she spends with a very young boy named Josué (de Oliveira).So the film is a character study, made in a language that is not of the English variety and stretches out to a little bit under two hours. But what brought it its success, I think, is its familiarity in regards to structure, a constantly shifting film that moves on down its single strand arc, effortlessly gliding from location to location and setup to pay-off. The beginning of Dora's transformation occurs not so far from her own door given how many miles she must travel in this film. She witnesses a young boy steal something from a stand before he is chased by security and mercilessly shot in a desolate area near the station. The initial incident from the outside that interrupts Dora's life, which itself could constitute as the set up, is her acquiring of Josué, when a tragedy befalls him. She figures he is helpless and may need to steal to live, similarly to what the prior, now dead, youth had to do also.The centre of the film revolves around Dora delivering Josué to his father, an address that she acquired a few days earlier when the boy's own mother dictated a letter to her. The character's goal is in a very remote and far off place, too many bus rides and truck lifts away to be reached in a relatively quick time. But complications to do with people having moved on or being missing equate to the two having to trek on to the point where it would be wiser to continue into the unknown rather than just turn back, since a certain point as been crossed.During this time, Dora will undergo a transformation. The ideas behind the film are perfectly captured by a truck driver, whose words double up as the film's entire study, something the author(s) wants to make quite clear. At one point, whilst driving flat out on the open road, the trucker exclaims that 'the open road has changed him'. Not only this but 'many times' when discussing his job and his experiences with Dora. Principally this is exactly the point. Central Station, being the 'road movie' that it is, allows two or slightly more persons to learn more about themselves as they travel on a continuous route of no return. This is the crux of the film as explained by an individual who is helpful for as long as he needs to be, states what he needs to state before being removed from the text once his kind-natured spirit is brought into repute for aiding in some shoplifting.Additionally, the boy Josué himself brings to both our and Dora's attention Dora's flaws. If the demonisation of Josué's father is very much present as this uncaring and far away individual, who enjoyed being under the influence of alcohol, then the boy points out Dora bears a similar mindset with her attitudes to alcohol. The statement draws on parallels with the father, as this uncaring and quite solemn individual who doesn't see job through. Then we remember Dora's attitude to all the letters she wrote and to the people she took money off of, while she insulted them in the process. Is Dora any better than the boy's father? Did she ever stop to think of this? Perhaps the father is a better person for at least he, as pointed out by the boy, could mould wood and earn a living out of a skill.While thoroughly engaging and always interesting as interactions and situations are played out, Central Station takes time to develop exchanges and studies like all great, slow-burning character studies do.

It is commonly believed that kongfu movies are brought to try to amuse Oscars; they are tasted just like McDonald's and with little value to us.But Ba Wang Bie Ji (farewell ,my concubine) is fairly thought as an excellent movie made by native Chinese director (unfortunately it is his only masterpiece, I think).The other day at a famous movie fan website of China, 95% or more voted it for the best Chinese movies all time with another two or three.Regular viewers of IMDb could not probably understand what the movie is about.The name of this movie comes from a play of Beijing Opera, the Beijing Opera is usually adapted from old Chinese history, of which are well-known by Chinese people.In this tragic story happened in the end days of Qin Dynasty, a fistful of heroes chase the power. Xiang Yu (Ba Wang) is the most heroic and romantic one. But finally he is defeated by his cunning rival Liu Bang who is the founder of Han, what Chinese ethnic majority names after. In an intense battle where Ba Wang is embattled, his army is totally destroyed, his beloved mistress, Yu Ji, tries to persuade him to run away and come back with recruited armies. Ba Wang refuses to leave her, so she kills herself to let her man leave. This is not a complicated story but much too tragic and touching (Ba Wang kills himself too as he is too shameful to go back to his hometown).In the movie, the opera adapted from the old story was performed in early time of Republic China, when the country was in a mode of civil war and natural disasters. As a tradition of the Beijing Opera, actors playing feminine roles were all males.Sometimes they were mentally displaced by considering himself a woman.Die Yi devoted herself into the opera and fell in love with the hero Ba Wang performed by Xiao Lou, and that was why this is not a gay movie.It was long ago before the last time I saw it, and I barely remembered plenty of details of the plot. But one thing impressed me was the mix of modern-history and life between the roles and actors.In one word, it is not just an excellent opera of the ancient tragedy but a real story about the actor and actress. Xiao Lou and his woman experienced the regime of Japanese and civil war and he actually married a woman as his real wife. The play is so well-known and popular that even the communists allowed them to go on playing. During the Culture Revolution, many people were insulted and abused if they were suspected to have connection with capitalistic enemies or simply categorized as counter-revolutionists. Die Yi was also humiliated and tortured at public because she once performed for the Japanese invaders to rescue Xiao Lou during WWII.As it usually happened those days, the one who was judged as counter-revolutionist would be rejected by his family and friends.

It is commonly believed that kongfu movies are brought to try to amuse Oscars; they are tasted just like McDonald's and with little value to us.But Ba Wang Bie Ji (farewell ,my concubine) is fairly thought as an excellent movie made by native Chinese director (unfortunately it is his only masterpiece, I think).The other day at a famous movie fan website of China, 95% or more voted it for the best Chinese movies all time with another two or three.Regular viewers of IMDb could not probably understand what the movie is about.The name of this movie comes from a play of Beijing Opera, the Beijing Opera is usually adapted from old Chinese history, of which are well-known by Chinese people.In this tragic story happened in the end days of Qin Dynasty, a fistful of heroes chase the power. Xiang Yu (Ba Wang) is the most heroic and romantic one. But finally he is defeated by his cunning rival Liu Bang who is the founder of Han, what Chinese ethnic majority names after. In an intense battle where Ba Wang is embattled, his army is totally destroyed, his beloved mistress, Yu Ji, tries to persuade him to run away and come back with recruited armies. Ba Wang refuses to leave her, so she kills herself to let her man leave. This is not a complicated story but much too tragic and touching (Ba Wang kills himself too as he is too shameful to go back to his hometown).In the movie, the opera adapted from the old story was performed in early time of Republic China, when the country was in a mode of civil war and natural disasters. As a tradition of the Beijing Opera, actors playing feminine roles were all males.Sometimes they were mentally displaced by considering himself a woman.Die Yi devoted herself into the opera and fell in love with the hero Ba Wang performed by Xiao Lou, and that was why this is not a gay movie.It was long ago before the last time I saw it, and I barely remembered plenty of details of the plot. But one thing impressed me was the mix of modern-history and life between the roles and actors.In one word, it is not just an excellent opera of the ancient tragedy but a real story about the actor and actress. Xiao Lou and his woman experienced the regime of Japanese and civil war and he actually married a woman as his real wife. The play is so well-known and popular that even the communists allowed them to go on playing. During the Culture Revolution, many people were insulted and abused if they were suspected to have connection with capitalistic enemies or simply categorized as counter-revolutionists. Die Yi was also humiliated and tortured at public because she once performed for the Japanese invaders to rescue Xiao Lou during WWII.As it usually happened those days, the one who was judged as counter-revolutionist would be rejected by his family and friends.

You couldn't ask for a better cast Boris Karloff as a snarling, unhinged scientist who wants to follow in the footsteps of the infamous Dr. Frankenstein; J. Carrol Naish as his pitiable hunchbacked assistant; Lon Chaney Jr. as the Wolf Man; John Carradine in his first of two appearances as Dracula for Universal Studios; and Glenn Strange as Frankenstein's Monster. While House of Frankenstein seems to move a bit too quickly at times, and Carradine and Strange aren't really given much to do, the viewer is going to have a blast and that's all that matters. To me, it's Karloff who puts this film over the top. (I haven't seen the sequel, House of Dracula, but I would imagine it suffers at least a little from his absence.) The man never delivered a bad performance, and here he really gets to sink his teeth into a juicy villainous role. Naish is also very good; there's something about his eyes that makes it difficult to imagine anyone else playing the lovelorn hunchback. Chaney projects a certain sympathetic quality, too, but he's never been my favorite of the major horror actors of the twentieth century. Carradine is great as a glaring, mustachioed Dracula (though I wish he'd had more screen time), and Strange's gaunt face is the ideal canvas for Jack Pierce's legendary Frankenstein makeup. Minor horror luminaries Lionel Atwill and George Zucco also make brief appearances. Divided more or less evenly into two sections (the first of which focuses on Carradine, the second on Karloff and his simultaneous efforts to resurrect Strange and cure Chaney's lycanthropy), House of Frankenstein was the first of Universal's so-called 'monster rallies'. It's not in the same league as the first two Frankenstein films directed by James Whale, of course, but the presence of top-shelf performers like Karloff and Carradine keeps this film on track.

It's so fantastic to see the cream of British talent merged into a film that not only details events leading up to the what-we-now-call the rave culture but it displays a thoroughly in-depth representation of lifestyle in the country with so much British humour pouring out of it. Not knowing much about the punk-rock culture that gripped the world at that time, i was unaware of what to expect and probably thought i'd be seeing another 'Human Traffic', but i couldn't have been more wrong. '24 Hour Party People' sends you on a journey through the life of TV presenter\/founder of Factory Records Tony Wilson, a production company that put such world-famous bands on the map such as 'Happy Mondays' and 'Joy Division'. With so many characters bursting with charisma and energy along the way, it's so hard to believe that such a wide variety of British actors (John Simm, Paddy Considine, Peter Kay, Shirley Henderson and Rob Brydon to name but a few) can actually make a film like this work, but not even these so talented performers damage the pace and genuity of such a work of art.This film sometimes had me believing whether what i was watching was fact or fiction, with the film largely based on true events and shot in mockumentary for, i sometimes struggled to realize history from point-of-views, but this only heightened the originality and structure of the movie. At of everything great about this movie, Steve Coogan has to come out at best. Everything he does is so down-right hilarious yet meaningful, bringing all of the brilliant characters to the height of their game. He basically moulds the entirety of the film and never shows signs of stopping when all has failed. OK so i could see hints of Alan Partrige in him (most notably the first section of the film when he hang-glides) but this only jolted me into hysterics more. This is a quality actor who should never be overlooked as one of Britain's all-time performers.Overall, i don't really have anything particularly bad to say about this film, and that's usually not the case for me! So if your a British citizen, whether or not you want to explore the origins of a key culture in our society (even today) this film is for you! I don't really know how it will go down with the rest of the world as their could be many mixed reviews, this is all down to the distribution and making of the film, you don't know whether it could be mainstream cinema or British indie. But this shouldn't put you off at all, so to see the best British comedians and actors with more chemistry (and chemicals) than a science lab, go out and get 24 Hour Party People! You will not regret it!p.s. the only thing it was missing was Lee Evans!
