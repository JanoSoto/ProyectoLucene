We discover, as Murdoch gradually does, the true nature of The Strangers and the fate that has befallen the citizens of this topsy-turvy world as the story unravels.Deliberately underplayed, the characters that inhabit this caliginous world might seem cardboard at first, but upon the film's full revelation it should be fairly easy to understand why. Careful never to reveal too much too soon, Dark City takes you on a journey that is alien, eerie, a bit unnerving and so much fun.This film is not for everybody.  Some people I discussed it with found it boring.  I, on the other hand, was mesmerized from beginning to end.  If you enjoy this film you ought to know that upon my second viewing, I found many details that weren't apparent the first time.

Well, it IS good-looking in a way that I've not seen since Baron Munchausen or maybe Brazil.  But then I got mired in the conception of Heaven\/Hell as seen in this movie.  You can have anything in Heaven, but there are rules about how to perceive things and move around.  It's whatever you want it to be, but Chris can't have Annie (first she's alive, then she's in Hell; what if they'd had a different kind of relationship and she didn't want HIM?  Chris' perception of Annie can be just fantasy anyway, right?).  And of course, how could you enjoy Heaven knowing the lost souls are stuck and in torment?  And once Chris sets out to find Annie, the movie starts to sound like a quest film (these are your instructions, these are the rules), but the action never takes off (he finds her and saves her in an inexplicably short time).  I will say the movie makes one think, if one hasn't already, about the nature of the afterlife, and it's great to look at, but it's very frustrating.  Funny that this movie is getting so many bad reviews; given that it seems pretty mainstream, it seems to have offended a lot of people.

Snake Eyes, the latest movie from veteran director  Brian De Palma is messed up horribly after a promising start with what looks to be a classic cop out to the profit motive. It shouldn't have happened. De Palma has made some classics including Carrie,  Carlito's Way, Wise Guys and Scarface but has allowed Snake Eyes to degenerate to the laughable, in spite of some great moments. We have a prize fight with 14000 fans in the arena and a high ranking U.S. defence department official sitting conveniently in the second row is assassinated. A long, flashy, impressive single shot precedes this which establishes Rick Santoro (Nicholas Cage) as a high ranking, devious, utterly corrupt, senior local cop. His old time, navy buddy, mate Kevin Dunne (Gary Sinese) is looking after the security of the politician and Santoro takes charge of the investigation, protecting Dunne's reputation and locking everyone inside the building. Then a classic good cop\/bad cop dilemma presents itself, in an environment where at the telling moment I couldn't believe that the worm would turn. De Palma does triumph with his cinematography, creating a maelstrom of confusion in the arena before and after the assassination. There's a later scene where the camera wanders above the ceiling of a neighbouring casino as a search is in progress, a memorable presentation and there are also the De Palma trademark multiple images and shifts in point of view which are interesting. What lets him down is the story which he co-wrote with David Koepp (The Paper, Jurassic Park, De Palma's Carlito's Way and Mission Impossible). They give away most of the secrets far too early and the film makers even turn to product endorsements during telling moments! Nicholas Cage also overacts to a fault (no doubt with De Palma's encouragement ) gets beaten up and then wanders ever so slowly along a corridor, lurching along with a misshapen face just like Charles Laughton in The Hunchback Of Notre Dame. There's a hurricane roaring outside (apparently a tidal wave no less was in the original script!) and I was convinced that God himself was going to take his\/her vengeance on the whole damned lot, as I suppose the tidal wave would have done, no doubt to the accompaniment of Notre Dame's cathedral bells.

They give away most of the secrets far too early and the film makers even turn to product endorsements during telling moments! Nicholas Cage also overacts to a fault (no doubt with De Palma's encouragement ) gets beaten up and then wanders ever so slowly along a corridor, lurching along with a misshapen face just like Charles Laughton in The Hunchback Of Notre Dame. There's a hurricane roaring outside (apparently a tidal wave no less was in the original script!) and I was convinced that God himself was going to take his\/her vengeance on the whole damned lot, as I suppose the tidal wave would have done, no doubt to the accompaniment of Notre Dame's cathedral bells. But then it became obvious  that a Monty Python big foot, with painted toenails, wouldn' t have gone astray, smashing down on the villains, and then the second half of Snake Eyes would have been revealed to have been truly the farce it was apparently meant to have been.

There is a hinted romance between Sarah and Ashe, but it is quickly buried and is a huge missed opportunity in my opinion. Story is this film's Achilles heel, but it's visuals are its strength.
