Its a mock cover of the famous Rolling Stone magazine featuring the aging 70's band 'Strange Fruit'. You can tell quite easily the movie is going to be a good laugh by the quite disturbingly haggard and unsexy looking pose from Nighy in the centre, its funny and icky at the same time.The plot, as you can imagine, is all about getting the band back together for a reunion concert. Back in the day 'Strange Fruit' were on the brink of stardom but it all fell apart when their lead singer died of a drugs overdose. Twenty years later Rea trying to get the guys back on-board whilst having to deal with each members current problems and the confrontations that have reared up again. Eventually, once everybody is brought together again, it is discovered their old lead guitarist (brother of their old lead singer) has also apparently died of a drugs overdose (as is the norm in this business). This forces the band to hire a much younger guitarist for their comeback adding more tension. Can the lads all come together and prove to themselves they've still got what it takes? or they had what it took originally to make it to the big time?I think the casting is the one main factor that makes this film work, the small British ensemble casting of Nighy, Nail, Rea, Connolly and Spall. Not only does this group of oddball character actors gel together perfectly but visually they actually look like an aging 70's rock band too. Nighy as the flaky somewhat slow long haired rock-star lead singer, Connolly has always looks the part of a hippie rock singer so no worries there, Rea with his curly Brian May hairdo, Nail the deep conscientious heart of the band, the hard worker with strong morals and family values and finally Spall looks like a dirty unwashed biker with Inland Revenue issues.I liked the whole loggerhead scenario between Nighy's character and Nail's character. Nighy's character being the epitome of a glamorous fame obsessed money grabber, his larger then life rock-star lifestyle clashing against the quiet brooding song writer of Nail's character. Nighy does tend to be the problem in the band for the most part with his overbearing wife and the fact he is still haunted by the reality that he was hired as a replacement for the bands old lead singer. He tries to elevate his performances with glam costumes and stage effects because he's insecure over his own abilities, now being much older. This in turn affects the band and their overall performances which provides both amusing and sober sequences.The situations and scenarios are really authentic within this film. The group having to slum it around backstreet nightclubs for work and recognition, dodgy stage safety, trying to re-tune their skills whilst bickering with each other, bad food on the go, little money, poor accommodation and the obligatory sex drugs and booze problems. This angle is stronger because its also about a group of old men trying to rekindle something great they once had, reigniting an old flame. The outlook on life and the music is very different from their younger days, its not all about sex drugs and roll 'n' roll anymore, there is more to it than that. Sure they wanna be like their younger selves again and uncork that lightning in a bottle but the team has to learn to settle old scores, move on and help each other with their dreams.The locations humour visuals and dialog is all typically British and it is a hoot to watch but the fall outs and reconciliations along the way do get a bit frustrating, you just wanna slap them and tell them to get on with it. The movie does tend to drag a tad through the middle, there are some nice montages and some great original musical numbers but the break up of the band midway brings with it lots of moping by Nail's character who can be overly broody. Its mainly Nail Nighy and Rea who carry the film honesty, Connolly and Spall tend to fade in and out of the background whilst Matheson does his best Liam Gallagher walk at one point. The finale and its little twist is cute but completely predictable, but we all knew it would end on a happy note I'm sure.A fantastic nod to the late 60's 70's glam rock era of course, many influences, very relatable for many I'm sure and very very very British with its dry wit and toilet humour.

Luckily someone in 1925 made a great film also called The Lost World, so you should probably watch that one instead.In what I think is the British Natural History museum, a professor has announced that he's found a hard to access plateaux that still holds a full eco-system of dinosaurs. Fed up with everyone pointing and laughing at him, the professor states that he's heading back there to rescue someone he had to leave behind. He recruits the daughter of the missing man, a cynical scientist, a big game hunter, a guy in blacked up make up called, worryingly, Zambo, and very reluctantly, a journalist (after the two of them have a good old punch up). They also have some other guy and a monkey tag along too.They get to the plateaux pretty quickly, and just in time to see a Pteradactyl flying around, so they know they're at the right place. There's also some kind of monkey man up there who doesn't like the look of these strangers and tries to crush them with a rock (the make up for this guy is top class, considering the age of this film). Eventually, they do get up there, only for a Brontosaurus to come along and ruin their only route out.What follows thereafter is a brilliant parade of stop motion dinosaurs chowing down on each other and trying to eat the cast, while the cast are stalked by monkey man and try and figure out how to escape. For example, an Allosaur attacks a Tricerotops and gets gored for his trouble, only for another Allosaur to come along, attack the Tricerotops, then grab a Pteradactyl out of the sky and eat that too! That's good stuff right there man. There's also a post-volcanic eruption scene full of dinosaurs that must have been some spectacle back in the day.It's a very short film (just over an hour, although now I see that I've watched an edited version) and worth a look for those interested in the old dinosaur movies, or to see what a special effects extravaganza from the twenties looks like.

Alternatively, they can make us think about who we really are &#x96; this is where Fargo comes in. In anyone else's hands, Fargo would be a very ordinary movie, telling the story of a series of crimes and a detective who tries to solve them. In the hands of the Coen Brothers, it's a gory and often hilarious look at criminal life in cold Minnesota, and the oddball characters involved in it.The focus for the first third of the film is Jerry Lundegaard, a car salesman played superbly by William H. Macy, who is in need of money, and hires two criminals (Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare) to kidnap his wife so that he can take some of the ransom money. He's a brilliantly written character, who gets far too nervous in the tricky situations he's stuck in, and always tries to recover as things don't go his way. As things go wrong for the criminals they are forced to kill a number of witnesses, which gives them even more problems. This brings in the film's main character, pregnant Police Chief Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand), who is calm and polite in her investigations and fascinating to watch. McDormand manages to steal the show brilliantly, with her awkward facial expressions at times and perfectly placed one-liners at others. It's difficult to see anyone else playing the role.The script of the film is so sharp, but it's rare that the Coen Brothers don't deliver that for us. Why does the film make you think about yourself though? Because of its violence and the way you react to it. When Jerry's wife is being kidnapped, she hides in the shower and then runs along the hall unable to escape from the shower curtain, eventually falling down the stairs. It's brutal, but it's so ridiculous and so well shot that it's also kind of funny. The criminals, especially Buscemi's character, are so idiotic that their mishaps, including Buscemi being shot in the face, also make you laugh. The thing that really makes all of this click is the setting, the wintry town of Fargo, its bizarre residents and particularly the accent. There is one scene where Marge only says Yah, but does it in such a way that it can't help being funny. They're ridiculous without being too simple, and constantly watchable.Fargo is a relatively brief movie, at only 98 minutes long, but it uses every second to its advantage in painting this brilliant, funny and bizarre story.

The thing that really makes all of this click is the setting, the wintry town of Fargo, its bizarre residents and particularly the accent. There is one scene where Marge only says Yah, but does it in such a way that it can't help being funny. They're ridiculous without being too simple, and constantly watchable.Fargo is a relatively brief movie, at only 98 minutes long, but it uses every second to its advantage in painting this brilliant, funny and bizarre story. It shows all of its actors, and its two directors, at their very best, and doesn't let up for one moment so that you are always willing to go along for the ride.

It's as if this movie switches gears at the halfway mark into absurdly hammy psychological thriller mode. Just goes right over the cliff. I know these sex scenes were provocative twenty years ago, but now they're lost in the misogynist script and bad Michael Douglas performance. It's funny, the only person I cared about in the movie was George Dzundza. Douglas comes off as a cartoon most of the time and Stone is just sex appeal (to her credit, she plays that to the hilt). My problem with the whole thing is that I didn't care about most of these people, which is bad when the movie's constantly asking me to guess who's doing the killing. Aside from some great Rob Bottin effects, there's not much here. It's excessive, runs long and and is manipulative garbage right to the very last shot. 4\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"3 September 2014","score":"3 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":" Up until maybe an hour in, BASIC INSTINCT isn't bad; kind of an average Michael Douglas police procedural with an icy blonde playing head games.

He does extremely well putting together what is an equal balance of absurd, yet interesting storyline. Taking accomplished actors and making them overreact, or sticking smut in their face (The chick with the third breast is pretty memorable).Definitely one of Arnold Schwarzenegger's best. He plays Douglas Quaid, a man in the year of 2084 who has dreams of going to Mars. Essentially he goes to buy the tickets at Rekall, where they offer fictional memory implants and during the transaction is offered a fantasy package of being a secret agent. However, whilst undergoing the procedure it seems Arnold's character has a past (Or does he?), that eventually leaves him on the run from a bunch of agents (Most notably the always awesome Michael Ironside).Loosely based on the Philip K. Dick story We Can Remember It for You Wholesale, and stuck in development hell for a long time. I would thoroughly recommend seeing this movie, and not for the fact it was one of the most expensive films at the time of it's release. It's the kind of role that suits Schwarzenegger and the creature effects, set designs and make up still look brilliant. Horrible one liners? Pardon my language, but £%$^ me there's to many gold ones to count.Final Verdict What a way to kick off the 1990's. Check it out as it is brilliant, mindless fun and highly re-watchable. 8\/10.
