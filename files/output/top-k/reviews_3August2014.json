[{"date":"3 August 2014","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Alexander Payne burst into the consciousness of alternative-minded film fans with his shrewd abortion satire Citizen Ruth, and Election built upon that momentum, propelling him toward his Academy Award breakthrough, Sideways, and beyond. By assembling a fine ensemble, giving them outrageous yet credible dialogue and interactions, and including enough surprises to keep everyone guessing until the very end, Payne creates a highly amusing scandal out of a seemingly innocent scholastic tradition. Reese Witherspoon's devious overachiever and Matthew Broderick's frustrated burnout are the highlights of many outstanding performances, most of which are characters equally sympathetic and despicable. It's fitting that all these anxious adversaries become so dependent upon the outcome of something as trivial as a student body election, to the point where their obsessions take as much of a toll on their lives as the ballot box results. A few times Payne goes a bit too far and falls flat, including an unnecessary bee sting, but those instances are easily forgiven when so many of his risks are rewarding. The tangled web of incompatible motivations is entertaining and diverse, as demonstrated by the hilarious trio of pep assembly speeches given by the presidential candidates. Election is both an important chapter in the evolution of Alexander Payne and a welcome addition to the district of nonconformist high school films for both teens and adults that includes Heathers, Clueless, Dazed and Confused, Fast Times at Ridgemont High and their peers.
