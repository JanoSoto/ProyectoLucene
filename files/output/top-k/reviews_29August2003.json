It just suddenly stopped. *Note to self good thing I didn't pay to see this in the theater, as I surely would have approached the box office and asked for at least a partial refund.Anyway, I couldn't help enjoying the film. It is definitely a crime movie, along the lines of, say, a Joel and Ethan Coen film. But unlike those, this movie is simple, quiet, and seems to have a darkly vague and mysterious sense of satire all to itself. It's not full of over-the-top stunts, bloody shootings and car chases. There is, however, an excellent scene in which a hit man &#150; in a case of the hunter becoming the hunted &#150; gets plugged full of lead, and how! As a previous reviewer noted, it was a pure Monty Python worthy moment (think the Black Knight being de-limbed by King Arthur in Monty Python and the Holy Grail).The dialogue is either extremely deliberate or at times utterly meaningless, but it reminds me of other atmospheric sorts of movies such as The Spanish Prisoner, House of Games and August 32nd on Earth. And for that I was thankful, because it enhanced the quiet, detached feel of the film. Ditto for the filming locations. Though filmed in and around New York, it was tastefully void of splashy references to big-city surroundings.So watch this film sometime when you are in a quiet, laid back mood, when you just want to escape the usual hype and schlock of most modern day big-budget films.

Of coarse, in true original thriller fashion the nanny,Peyton Flanders is a raving lunatick who's got big plans for the family who employs her.Hand that rocks the cradle is perhaps one of the most unoriginal movies ever made. Basicaly, this is Fatal Attraction revisited except the the crazy lady actually moves in with the family she terrorizes.(a few other minor differences-she doesn't actually have an affair with the husband though he's attracted to her) but the central theme remains the same.Now with that said, I also have to admit that I liked this movie. I do not know the reason why I did. The movie is not a good one. I've seen many other thrillers similiar to this one, in both unoriginality and scare tactics and hated them. So what makes Hand that rocks the cradle different?I've thought about that and I think the answer is Rebecca De Mornay's portrayel as the nanny with issues. She is truely chilling as the sinister Peyton. De Mornay plays her as a soft spoken almost robot like woman who any viewer could see is problematic within 5 minutes of looking at her. And yet there is a child like appealing quality to Peyton that also comes through and watching her you can't help but be interested in the story as it unfolds.I think Peyton is maybe even more chilling then another havek wreaker Glen Cloe's Alex from Fatal Attraction.  Where Alex has to her, a kind of whiny hysterical quality that's apparent quite soon, with Peyton there is an almost blank montoneus quality and that's somehow even more frightening then Cloe's character.So I watched Hand that rocks the cradle but because this movie is what it is-which is your typical Fatl Attraction like thriller, I just can't bring myself to recomend it or call it a good movie. Instead, I'll say if you haven't seen it you might want to just for DeMornay's performance which is really welldone.And lastly, Ill make mention of the fact that this WHOLE crazy nanny scenario has been done before, there was a movie from a long time ago, that had an almost duplicate story, think it might have been made for tv. I can't remember the name of it, it might have been the nanny, oh well-guess I'll have to look it up on imdb...

Basicaly, this is Fatal Attraction revisited except the the crazy lady actually moves in with the family she terrorizes.(a few other minor differences-she doesn't actually have an affair with the husband though he's attracted to her) but the central theme remains the same.Now with that said, I also have to admit that I liked this movie. I do not know the reason why I did. The movie is not a good one. I've seen many other thrillers similiar to this one, in both unoriginality and scare tactics and hated them. So what makes Hand that rocks the cradle different?I've thought about that and I think the answer is Rebecca De Mornay's portrayel as the nanny with issues. She is truely chilling as the sinister Peyton. De Mornay plays her as a soft spoken almost robot like woman who any viewer could see is problematic within 5 minutes of looking at her. And yet there is a child like appealing quality to Peyton that also comes through and watching her you can't help but be interested in the story as it unfolds.I think Peyton is maybe even more chilling then another havek wreaker Glen Cloe's Alex from Fatal Attraction.  Where Alex has to her, a kind of whiny hysterical quality that's apparent quite soon, with Peyton there is an almost blank montoneus quality and that's somehow even more frightening then Cloe's character.So I watched Hand that rocks the cradle but because this movie is what it is-which is your typical Fatl Attraction like thriller, I just can't bring myself to recomend it or call it a good movie. Instead, I'll say if you haven't seen it you might want to just for DeMornay's performance which is really welldone.And lastly, Ill make mention of the fact that this WHOLE crazy nanny scenario has been done before, there was a movie from a long time ago, that had an almost duplicate story, think it might have been made for tv. I can't remember the name of it, it might have been the nanny, oh well-guess I'll have to look it up on imdb...

Certainly not award worthy, but then again, like the Oscars would know anything about award worthy material.It earns points for exploring a narrative angle I've never quite seen before in live action cinema (even if it does borrow heavily from the `let's-make-a-movie-about losers' film trend like with Clerks, Office Space, Straight Story.)  At least American Beauty is about fictitious characters and their portrayals remind of Tim Burton's Edward Scissorhands, that other-worldly, suburban-storybook-ish, caricature-or in other words none of the characters in American Beauty are real, but we don't care.  It's not supposed to be.  I won't bash them for being unrealistic, but I will criticize them for boring me.I found Kevin Spacey's character the most entertaining, but then again I always like the characters who stop giving a damn and start speaking the thoughts we all want to say to the people around us.

Lesson learned.  Moral earned.  How ironic!  Been there.  Done that.  Bored me there too.I do appreciate American Beauty's lack of a serious attempt at a plot.  It moves along at its own pace, documenting the loose correlations of isolated events at key points in the timeline about these characters.  Like with Kevin Smith's Clerks, American Beauty proves how overrated plot is and attempts to build on the characters alone and their lives, trials, and tribulations.

Not as much &#145;shallow' as opposed to &#145;empty'. This picture is typical Hitchcock suspense. There are plenty of creaks and jumps and `look behind you' scenes, but there aren't enough full on scare sequences. And much of these are just overused clichés. That said, there's a good deal of fun to be had along the way. Zemeckis is clearly having a blast behind the camera and successfully masters yet another genre. He puts a tremendous deal of skill into the proceedings. But there simply isn't enough material to work with. The film uneasily balances between domestic drama, supernatural chiller and all-out thriller, and the three sub-genres simply don't gel. While it starts well and ends well, there is a huge dissipation in the mid-riff. With the `horror' being reduced to a series of talky conversations, it's just too slow burning. But the closing half-hour is a skilful succession of high-octane moments that never wear thin. The less you know about the plot, the better. And whatever you do, don't read the tagline, as it will only spoil things.As the neurotic housewife, Michelle Pfeiffer is perfectly cast and brings depth to her first good role in a long time. And she holds her own against the more popular Harrison Ford, who curiously avoids the limelight for most of the movie. It's just surprising that he was credited first. Miranda Otto and James Remar on the other hand, are totally out of place. No that the performances are bad or anything, but after a revelation in the first 50 minutes, their characters are totally and utterly irrelevant to the plot.As soon as the emotional hokum gets going, the film loses a good deal of momentum, but the shear suspense of it all is what keeps `What Lies Beneath' going. But with the uneasy mixture, the bogeyman material seems out of place when in tone with the thriller aspect. While it is very slow-paced, my advice is to stick with the movie and you'll probably be rewarded. Zemeckis and Pfeiffer make a deadly combo and almost overcome the bogging down of sentimentality and a slightly shallow script. Eerie, creepy and surprising, `What Lies Beneath' is flawed, but generally good. My IMDb rating 5.9\/10.

I literally checked my watch every five minutes of this torturous three hour disaster of celluloid.  I have always found Malick to be a wholly overrated director, and this film only further convinces me.First of all, the man cast just about cast as many big name stars and favorable character actors as he possibly could, and then slapped all of their names on the posters and in the opening credits, even though many of them appear very briefly.  I don't consider George Clooney appearing for two minutes at the very end as some afterthought drill instructor reason to have his name get prime billing.  And I really like George Clooney.

They are entirely different constructs, therefore they make entirely different works.  Obvious comparison will result between 1998's two big war films, Saving Private Ryan and The Thin Red Line, but I honestly have to say that Spielberg's work is the lesser of two evils.Spielberg sees war as something to be glorified according to his Making Of documentary for 'Private Ryan.  Malick doesn't see war as anything other than an extension of his whole philosophical storyline.  To be honest, he doesn't know jack about his topic or setting.  I guarantee you that he could've made the same movie set in Harlem and garnered the same results, only better.  Thus, neither director is intelligent in his approach.  Only Lewis Milestone and Oliver Stone have come close to understand the real-world boundaries of conflict.As such, The Thin Red Line is not a prototypical war film, certainly by comparison to more recent works as Blackhawk Down, Windtalkers, or Enemy at the Gates.  The movie is not about pyrotechnics, but philosophy and psychology.  I am happy that it abandons the stereotypes of 'Private Ryan, but doesn't achieve the level of feeling in Platoon.  While the characters are not likable, they are credible.The cinematography and editing are two elements here that go into overkill.  The nagging flashbacks and continuous nature documentary\/art house shots rip the story from the film and the various narrations only cause annoyance.  Many of his shots are powerful in their fluidity, but the editing is too rocky for them to be effective.  If he is going for spiritual symbolism, he failed.  As a whole, the script becomes second to imagery and mood.  This is Malick's weakest film.  Hans Zimmer's work isn't his usual pompous work (Gladiator, The Lion King, The Rock), but is certainly effective in supplementing Malick's moods, not many composers can do that.Thin Red Line would certainly have been better if Malick took the time to review what others (Kubrick, Milestone, Coppola, and Stone in particular) had done before attempting this film.  Perhaps then he would have avoided many of the cliches and inevitable references that continuously pop up throughout the film.  Overall, you don't need to see this movie because prior films have covered the same territory before.  Malick is a visionary, but a visionary without a script.  2 out of 5 stars.

They are entirely different constructs, therefore they make entirely different works.  Obvious comparison will result between 1998's two big war films, Saving Private Ryan and The Thin Red Line, but I honestly have to say that Spielberg's work is the lesser of two evils.Spielberg sees war as something to be glorified according to his Making Of documentary for 'Private Ryan.  Malick doesn't see war as anything other than an extension of his whole philosophical storyline.  To be honest, he doesn't know jack about his topic or setting.  I guarantee you that he could've made the same movie set in Harlem and garnered the same results, only better.  Thus, neither director is intelligent in his approach.  Only Lewis Milestone and Oliver Stone have come close to understand the real-world boundaries of conflict.As such, The Thin Red Line is not a prototypical war film, certainly by comparison to more recent works as Blackhawk Down, Windtalkers, or Enemy at the Gates.  The movie is not about pyrotechnics, but philosophy and psychology.  I am happy that it abandons the stereotypes of 'Private Ryan, but doesn't achieve the level of feeling in Platoon.

I use his film in the most liberal sense here, as star Mel Gibson wrestled control of the film from Helgeland and imposed his own view on the final editing process. With this situation in mind, I fully expected A Knight's Tale to be a creative response to that negative filmmaking experience, a fun and free film that thumbed its nose at tradition and set style and which allowed the director's true vision to shine through with no outside interference. And my friends, that's exactly what I got when I first sat down to watch in back in 2001. A Knight's Tale celebrates the classic and vastly misused\/underused genre of medieval movies, while at the same time knocking the genre on its ear by instilling the film with modern themes, attitudes and a classic rock score. Sadly, it was these elements which repelled most viewers and led to A Knight's Tale's lackluster performance at the box office. Were these people just a little more open minded, they would have allowed themselves a wonderful movie-going experience that celebrates individuality, love, and above all else, friendship. Though the music is crucial to the uniqueness of this film (and a brilliant addition, I might add), it's the relationships amongst the characters that gives this film its heart. William and Jocelyn are the perfect couple bickering, floundering, and absolutely in love with one another. Wat, Roland, Kate and Geoff, wonderful characters unwilling to be fopped off as simple comic reliefs, show genuine love and loyalty to William, and do as much to contribute and carry the story along as William and the other two leads accomplish. Count Adamar, the film's villain, is a wonderful foil for William. He is cunning and cruel, and even in his moments of defeat, a character to respect. In many cases, such a villain would be made to seem wimpy or, at his moment of defeat, clumsy. Not so here, as Adamar is, throughout the film, a force to be reckoned with. I suppose part of why I love A Knight's Tale is my ability to relate to it so personally. I've certainly had my share of challenges, and aspired to be more than what I currently was. And I've also known friendships so loyal and loving that fiction could never invent. Most significantly, I've lived the pursuit of true love and, like William, have obtained it with no small amount of satisfaction. Everyone to some degree or another has also had these experiences in their lives, and its these experiences that built the foundation of A Knight's Tale, which is exactly what makes it such a wonderful film, more than worthy of a second chance by those who previously doubted it, and much more than worthy of a spot in any fan's movie collection.

And obviously, this was a hard time on the series; Harry Saltzman had left the partnership. Cubby Brocoli was left alone to do the work of two men, and he and the cast and crew really did try to make a good film. However, they tried so hard it seems that they wore themselves out and came up with a boring film. The action looks exciting but it doesn't make me feel excited. Jaws is a boring character. Roger Moore offers nothing new or fresh in his persona as 007, and this seems like the kind of acting you'd expect him to have in Live And Let Die. He also had his gun-barrel opening re-shot. I thought his first one was boring, but this one is even worse. And the gun barrel no longer looks real. In all the other 007 films, it looked like a real gun barrel. Here, it looks like a drawing.One major problem in the film is the female lead, Major Anya Amasova. It was declared that Bond had finally met his equal. However, he had already met his equal twice before, in his bride Tracy di Vicenzo in OHMSS and Pussy Galore of Goldfinger. Anya sounds like a very interesting character, but they didn't give her an interesting role in the film. For someone who is supposed to be Bond's equal, she certainly needs to get rescued a lot, and gets far too paniced in car chases and escapes. Tracy was in a much more dangerous car chase than the one here, and didn't panic at all. In fact, she was the one driving and joking about it later! And Anya is far too easily won over at the end of the film, and by the man who killed her lover.However, this film has it's redemtions that keep it below the half-bad, half-good mark. After an ill-tempered mannerism in The Man With The Golden Gun, M has returned to normal, and even became more caring to 007. He even calls him by his first name for once. I also liked M's counterpart from Russia, General Gogol.

After an ill-tempered mannerism in The Man With The Golden Gun, M has returned to normal, and even became more caring to 007. He even calls him by his first name for once. I also liked M's counterpart from Russia, General Gogol. In a time full of sterotypical evil Soviet dictators, it's nice to see a film that most likely presents the characters on the other side of the Cold War the way they probably were; much more sympathetic then we think. Of course Q is a welcome addition to the film, and his new car that is to Roger Moore what the Aston Martin is to Sean Connery; the Lotus Esprit; is incredible. I liked the villain; Carl Stromberg. Very great villain, but his death is very boring.The film gets a rating I doubt anyone has ever used; a 5 and 1\/4 out of 10.

It is a return to the character-driven plot of From Russia With Love and On Her Majesty's Secret Service. The story certainly seems good in essence. But when put into film, the plot turns out flattened and unexciting.As I said, the story itself is good; had Ian Fleming been alive and adapted it into a novel, it would've been a great plot. And obviously, this was a hard time on the series; Harry Saltzman had left the partnership. Cubby Brocoli was left alone to do the work of two men, and he and the cast and crew really did try to make a good film. However, they tried so hard it seems that they wore themselves out and came up with a boring film. The action looks exciting but it doesn't make me feel excited. Jaws is a boring character. Roger Moore offers nothing new or fresh in his persona as 007, and this seems like the kind of acting you'd expect him to have in Live And Let Die. He also had his gun-barrel opening re-shot. I thought his first one was boring, but this one is even worse. And the gun barrel no longer looks real. In all the other 007 films, it looked like a real gun barrel. Here, it looks like a drawing.One major problem in the film is the female lead, Major Anya Amasova. It was declared that Bond had finally met his equal. However, he had already met his equal twice before, in his bride Tracy di Vicenzo in OHMSS and Pussy Galore of Goldfinger. Anya sounds like a very interesting character, but they didn't give her an interesting role in the film. For someone who is supposed to be Bond's equal, she certainly needs to get rescued a lot, and gets far too paniced in car chases and escapes. Tracy was in a much more dangerous car chase than the one here, and didn't panic at all. In fact, she was the one driving and joking about it later! And Anya is far too easily won over at the end of the film, and by the man who killed her lover.However, this film has it's redemtions that keep it below the half-bad, half-good mark.

Very great villain, but his death is very boring. The reference to Bond's wife and that it shows he hasn't forgotten her and misses her was touching.The film gets a rating I doubt anyone has ever used; a 5 and 1\/4 out of 10.

I'm onlysurprised they didn't invent a worldwide law that somehow would prohibit the two from being together. It's that absurd. It also wouldhave helped if the two principles had some chemistry between them. These two act like each word they say to the other is going to somehow determine life and death.

Then I watched it and confirmed what my fuzzy memory was telling me. This is a sci-fi movie with heart. Now saying a sci-fi movie has heart is like saying that John Carpenter still makes good movies. Bear with me though, because Starman is a emotional story. Jeff Bridges' performance, however minimalist, works well with his character. His character manages to blank out Karen Allen's performance where, try as she might, doesn't do a good job. Ms. Allen just isn't a very good actress. Don't fault her though, she has a nice smile. The movie lags in some scenes but overall provides some good entertainment. There is no action or incredible special effects but this still decent sci-fi.
