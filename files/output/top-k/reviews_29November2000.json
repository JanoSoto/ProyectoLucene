I truly love experimental work that pushes boundaries.  However, I have to say that it was one of the most horrible movies I've seen in a long time.The four quadrant's idea was very interesting, but that was the only remotely interesting thing here.  Otherwise this film fails on just about every level.The camera work is horrible.  It was all done with obviously cheap hand-held video cameras.  The lenses are so cheap you can see the radial distortions every time them moved.  They are not on steadycams, so they bounce around quite a bit.  And, they were in the hands of small children, I think.  All of the footage looked very amateur.  Focus would be lost and regained, cameras would point arbitrary directions, pans were fast enough to make you dizzy, and more than that I don't want to remember.  The only interesting thing is that they never showed any cameramen that I noticed, but I would have preferred to see some cameramen here and there in exchange for some decent cinematography.The sound was also awful.  I really think they miked this with the cheap microphones on home camcorders. What they were saying was often indecipherable.  Arbitrary, unrelated music gets dropped in very now and then just to annoy you.  Not that it made much difference.  The entire movie was ad libbed and it really showed.  The acting was not half bad when they had something to work with, but they rarely ever did. And, would someone tell Holly Hunter to QUIT CRYING!  We're really tired of it.  What was really sad what that I expected information overload and, instead, found entire sections of the film boring.  With four scenes running you would think there would be something going on all of the time, but there were lots of times when nothing was happening in any of them.  It was often quite dull.Keeping all of this in sync was very creative and the idea as innovative.  But, the execution stunk, so don't waste your time.

With an upbeat, elaborate plot loosely similar to 1999's Stir of Echoes, together director Raimi (A Simple Plan) and writer Billy Bob Thornton (star, director and writer of 1996's wonderful Sling Blade)really know how to make an audience jump out of their seats! Although it was Oscar nominee Cate Blanchett (of 1997's Elizabeth)that was donned the title role, the true star (who hopefully won't be denied of an Oscar nomination for best Supporting Actor) is Giovanni Ribisi. Even more so than Keanu Reeves who plays a character he never played before, Ribisi dominates in making the audience jump, laugh, cry, and simply say Wow! Is that really the guy who starred in that rancid Gary Marshall movie The Other Sister? Yes, that is how good he is. Hillary Swank (Woah do I envy her abilities after one of my personal favorites 1999's Boys Don't Cry... She's the kind of girl I wish would e-mail me and meet me somewhere for lunch, dinner for that matter!) plays Keanu's abused wife who looks to Blanchett for spiritual advice. (Yes, the title of the movie comes from Blanchett's gift being a professional tarot card reader, VERY professional!)As always, including her adorable performance in The Next Karate Kid, Swank is brilliant, she has the nicest eyes, but her performance is amazing even past her eyes! Then Greg Kinnear and Katie Holmes (God bless her for NOT having a no-nudity contract)surprisingly play an engaged couple in the film. At first you'll think the casting is crazy but eventually you'll realize it was undeniably brilliant casting. Kinnear's character is not just thrown in, he is the school principal of Blanchett's two young boys, and he progresses into the widow of Katie Holmes, whose murder is the mystery of the film, the sight Blanchett must discover spiritually. I WILL NOT ruin the surprise ending for you under all circumstances for I strongly encourage you see this movie. It is almost impossible not to look this movie. The acting is great by everyone, the direction is eerily clever (but what do we expect from Raimi now that he learned his lesson from For Love of the Game), and the always brilliant work (writing in this case) of Billy Bob Thornton is great! It will scare you so be prepared, and also be prepared to have a good time! ENJOY!

What jokes there were went over the heads of the children in the theater. In fact, I can't recall a single time I heard children laugh at any of it. I'm sure one or two kids must have laughed once or twice, but I wouldn't bet on it. Jim Carrey was excellent. The idea that anybody athletic could have done the same job is idiotic. The good actor will almost always shine through the makeup and the costume, and he does. That said, though, he seemed hyperactive, compared to what I felt the Grinch was in the book. Maybe Ron Howard felt that constant activity would keep the kids in the audience entertained. That's a small point,though.

Clint Eastwood is perfect for this role and he has played it again and again.The Man with No Name is everything any man could want to be.  In this liberated age, he is quite possibly everything any woman could wantto be, either.  He is a flawless or virtually flawless character by virtueof the divine mission with which he's been entrusted.  He is an agentof metaphysical justice.  He has superhuman power precise, pene- trating judgement, nerves of steel and an iron will.  He is calm, cool and always in control under pressure.  He is never frightened and hecan endure anything.  If an ordinary man had these strengths, he would never be disappointed in life.  Fans of the Dirty Harry movies as well as nearly all of Eastwood'sother work will recognize that those characters simply reprise The Man with No Name which made him famous.

This time the action literally starts with a bang (a big one) when Riggs (Gibson) and Murtaugh (Glover) answer a call and, suffice to say, Riggs can't wait for the bomb squad to arrive.  It makes for a spectacular opening scene, but it's just a warm up for what follows.  Some bad things are going down in the City of Angels, perhaps not unusual for L.A., but someone is putting automatic weapons and armor piercing bullets (called `Cop Killers' as they can penetrate a bullet proof vest) on the streets, which is really bad news for police officers in general, and especially for those in particular areas of the city.  Riggs and Murtaugh are on the case, but it quickly escalates, and because of certain untoward circumstances soon falls into the hands of Internal Affairs.  Which brings Officer Lorna Cole (Rene Russo) into the picture.  And sparks begin to fly. \tThe first two installments of this series are hard to beat, but as they say, the third time's a charm; and Donner must have had the shaman working with him on this one, because he pulled off quite a feat-- making a third that ranks right up there with the first two.  He seems to have found the perfect balance with this one; the main characters are in place and established, Leo Getz (Joe Pesci) is back, and the addition of Russo is the icing on the cake.  The story is good, there's plenty of great action and some sensational stunts, and the humor has been toned down a notch, which increases the level of intensity of the drama.  In short, Donner measures out all of the right elements to perfection and makes it all gel together for the complete package.  And what a package it is. \tBy now, Gibson IS Riggs, from the inside out; still somewhat on the edge, but not quite as volatile.  And Glover could play Murtaugh in his sleep; which may sound like easy street for an actor, but it takes real professionals to maintain the credibility of characters they know so well (it would be so easy to phone it in and let the details slip at this point), and these two have what it takes.  Their chemistry remains intact, and they've put polish on an act that was already shining.  The real chemistry this time, however, is between Gibson and Russo, who click from the beginning, starting with their first scene together.  Russo sparkles as Lorna, putting some real style and spunk into her; there's just enough edginess to her to make her believable as a no-nonsense I.A. investigator, and it makes her the perfect match for Gibson's Riggs.  There's a terrific scene between them, in which they compare battle scars, that fits their characters so well and so credibly underscores the development of their relationship.  it's a memorable scene, and a good example of how well the script, by Jeffrey Boam and Robert Mark Kamen, was written. \tThe supporting cast includes Darlene Love (Trish), Traci Wolfe (Rianne), Stuart Wilson (Jack Travis), Steve Kahan (Capt. Murphy), Damon Hines (Nick), Ebonie Smith (Carrie) and Gregory Millar (Tyrone).  In the world of the Cinema, it's a rare thing when a sequel matches up to the original, and when the third does, it's a real triumph; and `Lethal Weapon 3' is just that, a triumph.

In short, Donner measures out all of the right elements to perfection and makes it all gel together for the complete package.  And what a package it is. \tBy now, Gibson IS Riggs, from the inside out; still somewhat on the edge, but not quite as volatile.  And Glover could play Murtaugh in his sleep; which may sound like easy street for an actor, but it takes real professionals to maintain the credibility of characters they know so well (it would be so easy to phone it in and let the details slip at this point), and these two have what it takes.  Their chemistry remains intact, and they've put polish on an act that was already shining.  The real chemistry this time, however, is between Gibson and Russo, who click from the beginning, starting with their first scene together.  Russo sparkles as Lorna, putting some real style and spunk into her; there's just enough edginess to her to make her believable as a no-nonsense I.A. investigator, and it makes her the perfect match for Gibson's Riggs.  There's a terrific scene between them, in which they compare battle scars, that fits their characters so well and so credibly underscores the development of their relationship.  it's a memorable scene, and a good example of how well the script, by Jeffrey Boam and Robert Mark Kamen, was written. \tThe supporting cast includes Darlene Love (Trish), Traci Wolfe (Rianne), Stuart Wilson (Jack Travis), Steve Kahan (Capt. Murphy), Damon Hines (Nick), Ebonie Smith (Carrie) and Gregory Millar (Tyrone).  In the world of the Cinema, it's a rare thing when a sequel matches up to the original, and when the third does, it's a real triumph; and `Lethal Weapon 3' is just that, a triumph.  It's a quality action\/drama that exemplifies why this series is so popular.  Simply put, it's a good movie on it's own, and part of a great series; so don't stop now, `Lethal Weapon 4' is ready and waiting for you.  I rate his one 10\/10.

What courage it took to play with images considered sacred. However, that so many favorable IMDb comments are from 'christians,' is a testament to his ultimate failure.But this is still a good experience.

But, man, this time, he REALLY missed his goal, and trust me, he will NOT get another $10 milion + for his next project or I'm out of here. Unbreakable is certainly nicely photographed and loaded with an amazing sound design, but this is supposed to be a MOTION picture, not a slides show with a nice digital sound background. Unbreakable is unbelievable, poorly written, unbearably slow, pretty much senseless AND pointless, for it is (very) loosely based on a weak plot made of comic books memorabilia and vague issues. Worst, Bruce W occasionally articulates some fuzzy phrases out of his static mouth, but that's it, talk about a paper-thin character!On the other hand, I really liked Samuel L.

Besides that, I could not care less about the overrated G versus E stuff, which at least shows that M. Night Shyamalan lacks of real directorial skills, and is completely unable to give consistency and basic believability to such a common, linear plot. Where he shows his great craft in cinematography and original (but sometimes lengthy) shots, he fails in lifting his already fragile story structure with real, consistent characters, all of them who end being trapped in the plot numerous potholes.Eventually, this movie lacks emotion, real conflict, developed characters (not those paperboard ones, save for Elijah) and A PLOT, for Pete's sake.
