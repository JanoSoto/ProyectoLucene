[{"date":"30 June 2004","score":"3 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":"  Rented the DVD, which also included great behind-the-scene interviews and amazing soundtracks by R.E.M. group. Watched it five times again and again in one week and enjoyed it every time.The movie depicts the life of Andy Kaufman, the unconventional comedian who achieved fame in late 70s and early 80s. Avid Kaufman fans who know every details of his life, complain about inaccuracies and lack of details in this movie. But for the rest of us who have barely heard of Kaufman, the movie is powerful, entertaining and touching. Jim Carrey presents a magnificent performance as Andy Kaufman, proving again that he acts better in dramatic movies than comedy. His portrayal of Kaufman is close to heart, and in words of his colleagues, it appeared as if Andy Kaufman had invaded his soul.Few people mentioned it here, but both Danny DeVito (as George Shapiro, Andy's manager) and Courtney Love (as Lynn Margulies, Andy's girlfriend) do a great job. The audience relate to them easily, admire their loyalty to Andy Kaufman and follow their emotional up and downs. Paul Giamatti does a decent job in portraying Bob Zmuda, Andy's writer and best friend.I was particularly touched by the last fifteen minutes of the movie, especially the funeral scene; laughed and cried with Shapiro, Margulies and Zmuda through the whole time. And if a movie could stir up emotions in the right way, who cares if a few historical details are inaccurate?Rated R for brief nudity, brief scenes of wrestling, and one scene with obscene language.Highly recommended.
