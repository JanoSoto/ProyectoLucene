[{"date":"31 December 2004","score":"","review":" Alexander Payne's 1999 film Election is quite simply the epitome of great film-making. Tracy Flick (Reese Witherspoon) is a manic overachiever who is running unopposed for the position of student body president at an Omaha high school. Jim McAllister (Matthew Broderick) is the student government adviser and history teacher who decides that she needs some competition, so he talks popular, dumb jock Paul Metzler (Chris Klein) into running against her. When Paul's younger sister Tammy, a lesbian, sees her lover take up with Paul to hurt her, she decides to throw her hat in the ring as well. The election becomes a farce the more the players get involved, even tumbling into their personal lives, and causing some of them to make decisions they normally wouldn't make, putting careers and reputations on the line.Election is hilarious from beginning to end. Payne's screenplay (adapted from the Tom Perotta novel of the same name) is sarcastic, biting and dark, yet at times these characteristics are so subtle that my internal sarcasm meter didn't know where to go. Several times I thought, Oh come on&#133;. Then realized that it was all part of the joke, which is sheer brilliance, considering I live for dark films like this. All of the main players are fantastic, primarily Witherspoon and Broderick. I am hardly a fan of Witherspoon, or her films, but she played the part of Tracy Flick brilliantly. Unfortunately I will always picture Matthew Broderick as Ferris Bueller, but this worked in his favor this time, because I really enjoyed seeing him playing a teacher (and a twisted, vindictive one to boot) in this film.Payne's direction of Election is just so good. After seeing this film for the first time a few years ago, I wanted to check out About Schmidt, and because of my extreme liking of those two films, I was anxious to see Sideways this year, which I loved. He is not afraid to be unusual, particularly when his subjects are so&#133;ordinary. His use of hilarious music, (that hilarious tribal shrieking when Tracy gets her ire up never fails to make me laugh) and split screens, coupled with cinematography that is rife with primary colors are just a couple of the factors that have made Alexander Payne one of my favorite modern directors. I would recommend this film to just about anyone, as long as they can keep an open mind and remember not to take everything as seriously as things may be presented. Remember to turn on that sarcasm meter and watch Election &#150; it is sheer brilliance. 9\/10 --Shelly ","genre":null},{"date":"31 December 2004","score":"","review":" Alexander Payne's 1999 film Election is quite simply the epitome of great film-making.
