All the usual elements are in place from the previous movies(particularly the bullying element,supplied by the always capable Thopmas F.Wilson,this time as Bad Biff's ancestor,Buford Mad Dog Tannen),and an added love interest for the normally reclusive Doc in the form of a delicate librarian named Clara(Mary Steenburgen),all moves seamlessly enough.

The British director began his career in the early 1940s, producing an assortment of relatively small dramas &#150; several adapted from the plays of Noel Coward &#150; and each exhibiting a profound understanding of mise-en-scène. However, it wasn't until 1957 that Lean discovered his true calling Columbia Pictures gave him a CinemaScope camera. Armed with an enormous tapestry on which to paint his masterpieces, the director produced 'The Bridge on the River Kwai (1957),' demonstrating to the cinema-going world a new standard in epic film-making, unsurpassed in its day and possibly even in the years since. 'Lawrence of Arabia (1962)' &#150; Lean's second Best Picture Oscar-winner, and probably my second favourite film of all time &#150; cemented his reputation as the master of ambitious epic cinema, and Freddie Young's acclaimed Super Panavision 70 cinematography captured the blazing, windswept desert sands in such magnificent detail that your planned holiday to northern Africa now seems rather redundant.If any director was most suited to adapt Doctor Zhivago, Boris Pasternak's mighty retelling of a difficult era in Russia's history, it was, indeed, David Lean. As was the case in his previous film, the plot itself comes second to the director's astonishing ability to capture the majesty of every instant, and to place the audience in the midst of the moment. As such, 'Doctor Zhivago (1965)' lacks any straightforward narrative, but its strength is drawn from the incredible emotion that accompanies each turn in events it's a story of love, loss, hope, war, family, revolution and death&#133; basically, everything that makes life worth living. Yuri Zhivago (Omar Sharif) stumbles passively through the turmoil that is Russia during the 1910s, both before and after the onslaught of WWI, and through his submissive eyes we watch citizens acclimatise to the constantly-shifting political climates of the era. During the Revolution of 1917, and the subsequent Russian Civil War, one's very existence was forever in doubt, and the uncertainty of the times consistently casts an ominous shadow over the fate of the film's major characters.Filming for 'Doctor Zhivago,' as was the case in 'Lawrence of Arabia,' was a long and gruelling experience for all involved. As Pasternak's novel was still banned in the Soviet Union at the time of the film's production it would not be officially published there until 1988, though several earlier samizdat editions could be found, filming took place primarily in Spain, with several sequences also shot in Finland and Canada. This extensive location-shooting allowed Lean to accurately reproduce the splendour of the Russian wilderness the bitter cold of the snow-swept winter landscapes, the vibrancy of the fresh and chilled summers. An entire Moscow city-block was recreated just outside Madrid, and it would take a sharp eye to discern that the icy cobbled streets of the film's opening act are not located in the Russian capital. Such are the scenes' authenticity that you shiver at the very thought of stepping outside into the falling snow, and, as Zhivago &#150; encrusted in a numbing case of ice &#150; trudges stiffly through the winterscape, we can almost feel our own limbs becoming numb with frostbite.Rarely has an epic delivered such an impressive display of acting performances. Omar Sharif, who was apparently surprised to have landed the lead character in David Lean's latest, doesn't initially strike one as being leading man material, but it is his passiveness in the role that proves crucial to the telling of Pasternak's story. He wanders dutifully through the changing landscape of Russia, rarely saying what he truly believes, and never displaying any genuine outbursts of emotion; he is a ghost of a person, and simply perseveres through his belief that better times are yet to come. Zhivago's primary emotional outlet is through his poetry, through which he articulates his passions and anguishes, though he only finds himself able to write when he finds himself in a comfortable living situation. His work has been condemned by the government for focusing on personal sentiments rather than the good of the state, an ironic foreshadowing of the censorship that Pasternak himself would encounter. Nevertheless, Zhivago comes across as quite a cold and detached character, and there's a selfishness inherent in his decision not to pursue his estranged family to Paris.Julie Christie provides the film's primary love interest, an abused and neglected woman in whom Zhivago finds an illicit companion. Independent, and yet very vulnerable, Lara forms the emotional core of the story, and it is through her association with the lead character that he is able to divulge his true feelings and pen his finest work. Geraldine Chaplin (for better or worse, a spitting image of her father) is also quite good as Zhivago's wife, Tonya, though her presence &#150; perhaps intentionally &#150; fails to evoke the same glamour and compassion as is the case with Lara. Rod Steiger, who has been greatly impressing me of late, is a slimy figure of egotism and malevolence (...and don't delude yourself this was rape. That would flatter us both), though his deeds in the film's final act raise a level of ambiguity that is interesting to ponder why, indeed, did he arrive to offer Lara warning? The motives of Gen. Yevgraf Zhivago, played by the great Alec Guinness, are similarly uncertain, and his apparent detachedness, almost indifference, to the plight of his half-brother is a puzzling riddle that only a second viewing could possibly resolve.

","genre":"Drama, Romance, War"},{"date":"11 May 2008","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Few filmmakers can claim to possess the extraordinary cinematic scope of David Lean. The British director began his career in the early 1940s, producing an assortment of relatively small dramas &#150; several adapted from the plays of Noel Coward &#150; and each exhibiting a profound understanding of mise-en-scène. However, it wasn't until 1957 that Lean discovered his true calling Columbia Pictures gave him a CinemaScope camera. Armed with an enormous tapestry on which to paint his masterpieces, the director produced 'The Bridge on the River Kwai (1957),' demonstrating to the cinema-going world a new standard in epic film-making, unsurpassed in its day and possibly even in the years since. 'Lawrence of Arabia (1962)' &#150; Lean's second Best Picture Oscar-winner, and probably my second favourite film of all time &#150; cemented his reputation as the master of ambitious epic cinema, and Freddie Young's acclaimed Super Panavision 70 cinematography captured the blazing, windswept desert sands in such magnificent detail that your planned holiday to northern Africa now seems rather redundant.If any director was most suited to adapt Doctor Zhivago, Boris Pasternak's mighty retelling of a difficult era in Russia's history, it was, indeed, David Lean. As was the case in his previous film, the plot itself comes second to the director's astonishing ability to capture the majesty of every instant, and to place the audience in the midst of the moment. As such, 'Doctor Zhivago (1965)' lacks any straightforward narrative, but its strength is drawn from the incredible emotion that accompanies each turn in events it's a story of love, loss, hope, war, family, revolution and death&#133; basically, everything that makes life worth living. Yuri Zhivago (Omar Sharif) stumbles passively through the turmoil that is Russia during the 1910s, both before and after the onslaught of WWI, and through his submissive eyes we watch citizens acclimatise to the constantly-shifting political climates of the era. During the Revolution of 1917, and the subsequent Russian Civil War, one's very existence was forever in doubt, and the uncertainty of the times consistently casts an ominous shadow over the fate of the film's major characters.Filming for 'Doctor Zhivago,' as was the case in 'Lawrence of Arabia,' was a long and gruelling experience for all involved. As Pasternak's novel was still banned in the Soviet Union at the time of the film's production it would not be officially published there until 1988, though several earlier samizdat editions could be found, filming took place primarily in Spain, with several sequences also shot in Finland and Canada. This extensive location-shooting allowed Lean to accurately reproduce the splendour of the Russian wilderness the bitter cold of the snow-swept winter landscapes, the vibrancy of the fresh and chilled summers. An entire Moscow city-block was recreated just outside Madrid, and it would take a sharp eye to discern that the icy cobbled streets of the film's opening act are not located in the Russian capital. Such are the scenes' authenticity that you shiver at the very thought of stepping outside into the falling snow, and, as Zhivago &#150; encrusted in a numbing case of ice &#150; trudges stiffly through the winterscape, we can almost feel our own limbs becoming numb with frostbite.Rarely has an epic delivered such an impressive display of acting performances. Omar Sharif, who was apparently surprised to have landed the lead character in David Lean's latest, doesn't initially strike one as being leading man material, but it is his passiveness in the role that proves crucial to the telling of Pasternak's story. He wanders dutifully through the changing landscape of Russia, rarely saying what he truly believes, and never displaying any genuine outbursts of emotion; he is a ghost of a person, and simply perseveres through his belief that better times are yet to come. Zhivago's primary emotional outlet is through his poetry, through which he articulates his passions and anguishes, though he only finds himself able to write when he finds himself in a comfortable living situation. His work has been condemned by the government for focusing on personal sentiments rather than the good of the state, an ironic foreshadowing of the censorship that Pasternak himself would encounter. Nevertheless, Zhivago comes across as quite a cold and detached character, and there's a selfishness inherent in his decision not to pursue his estranged family to Paris.Julie Christie provides the film's primary love interest, an abused and neglected woman in whom Zhivago finds an illicit companion. Independent, and yet very vulnerable, Lara forms the emotional core of the story, and it is through her association with the lead character that he is able to divulge his true feelings and pen his finest work. Geraldine Chaplin (for better or worse, a spitting image of her father) is also quite good as Zhivago's wife, Tonya, though her presence &#150; perhaps intentionally &#150; fails to evoke the same glamour and compassion as is the case with Lara.

He hopes the isolation will help his writing, but slowly the hotel seems to exert an insidious and malefic influence over him ...I think horror films are my favourite kind of movies, and I think The Shining is my favourite horror movie. The reasons why are hard to explain. It's an almost perfect movie technically, its plot is gripping, terrifying and extremely original (notable within the notoriously repetitive haunted-house sub-genre) and the performances are truly iconic, but it's more than that - it's something intangible in the atmosphere. I find the ghost story often works great in fiction but not so well on-screen; in The Shining the music, photography and art direction somehow combine to create an incredible atmosphere of dread and unease. The Overlook (all of which was built on sets at Elstree Studios) really becomes its own character in the film - the ultimate Bad Place - and when Jack finally descends into his rampaging homicidal lunacy for the finale he literally becomes The Overlook personified, as if the hotel has somehow gradually poisoned his soul until there's nothing left of the real person he used to be. It's this amazing sense of the evil of the place, as Danny tracks his trike around the corridors and the camera prowls around behind him, which somehow leaps off the screen and chills the blood. It's a metaphysical horror film, and it's the best one ever made. It's also scary in the best entertaining traditions - there's something delicious about the way it sets up this unusual, isolated family trio, and all the scares come from your anticipation of something bad happening to them; there is very little actual violence and only one on-screen death. The golden rule of horror storytelling is to create characters worth caring about, and this is, beg pardon, a shining example of how to do it well. Upon first viewing, Nicholson's tour-de-force performance as Jack (the loony par excellence in his extended gallery of loonies) tends to dominate, and it is exceptional, a wild study of a man losing his mind, but both Duvall and six-year-old Lloyd are incredible too. Duvall plays the living end of vulnerability and hysteria to perfection, and Lloyd delivers a beautifully innocent child's performance - watch his scenes with Crothers (who is also wonderful) where he just can't stop staring at him. There are many many great scenes in this movie - the astonishing opening credits helicopter swoop through the mountains, the creepy hag in room 237, the ghostly ballroom soiree, the all-work-and-no-play-makes-Jack-a-dull-boy moment, the blood in the elevator, all the incredible low-angle Steadicam shots through the hotel, Danny running through the snowy maze, the attack in the bathroom - but more importantly it all melds together so beautifully. The film is simultaneously exhilarating (watch out, Jack's gone nutty), deliciously enigmatic (I'm sorry to differ with you sir, but you are the caretaker. You've always been the caretaker.), and visually gorgeous. John Alcott's photography is simply the best - I cannot think of a film with more extraordinary and exquisitely tailored photography. Some people complain there are too many of Garrett Brown's incredible tracking shots - rubbish, there are exactly as many as needed and no more. I also love the sets, by Roy Walker and Les Tomkins, which are both amazingly convincing (the only real hotel shots are the few very wide exteriors, which are of the Timberline Lodge in Orgeon's Mount Hood National Forest) and amazingly disturbing. After viewing this movie you feel you know that place and could walk around and orient yourself, which is a great testament to any film. Because of the new innovation of the Steadicam at the time, the sets were deliberately built as a full space (as opposed to the usual three-walls principle), which only adds to their aura of gloom. Finally, there is Kubrick's typically inspired use of music; weird electronic shrieks and crows by Wendy Carlos which first unsettle us, and then an indescribable battering-ram of avant-garde symphonic screeches, thuds and growls by Bela Bartok, Gyorgy Ligeti and Krzysztof Pendericki, which hammer us into submission. Watch scenes like the one where Jack chases Danny through the maze, and you'll see photography, art direction, music and editing in simple perfect harmony. There's a lot of weird stuff about this movie which I can't help talking about, purely because it's one of my all-time favourite flicks. Oddly, it was shot in quite a narrow ratio, 1.371, and then blown out to 1.851 for projection. This review is of the European cut, which is 115 minutes; the US version is thirty minutes longer (and equally good) but the only differences are a few extra shots, a lot of very slightly shorter sequences and two missing scenes, one with Anne Jackson (as a doctor) and another with Tony Burton (as a car rental guy). The movie makes substantial changes from Stephen King's brilliant novel (which is an absolute must-read); the book's central metaphor is the hotel's boiler (which eventually explodes), there is a hedge topiary of animals (which come alive) rather than a maze, and Jack's alcoholism and weak character is much more to the fore. King and Mick Garris made an excellent four-hour TV version in 1997, which is highly recommended and much more faithful to the original story, but not the masterpiece that Kubrick delivers. There is also a hilarious parody called The Shinning in The Simpsons 1994 episode Treehouse Of Horror V. I simply can't rate this movie highly enough - it's everything a great horror film should be and so much more, and it's a showcase of what real cinema can do, made by an absolute master of the craft. Watch it over and over again and be amazed at the genius of Stanley Kubrick.

And yet, everything seemed to have conspired AGAINST it - George Lucas had to make it using his own money; it didn't have a popular series to be the movie version of, such as The Lord of the Rings; it was made with some of the leading roles being played by virtually unknown actors - and yet, it succeeded wildly beyond anything that anyone could possibly have imagined.

The action(which does perhaps have its moments, and there certainly is plenty of it) is relatively violent, but apart from that, nothing above the usual for 80's movies of this kind. It would undeniably pose something of a daunting task to locate a mere second(!) in this that isn't infinitely and instantly(not to mention incredibly) MST3K-worthy, and that tends to be the greatest source of entertainment when I watch it. What gives this what merit it does have(which really isn't an overwhelming amount) is that it actually features some pretty decent atmosphere, as others have said, partially due to the stretches that do not have any dialog. The story isn't terribly told, and it isn't the *worst* piece of cyberpunk out there. This goes somewhat fast, but it could also be attributed to it not even being 90 minutes long(seemed closer to 75 without credits), though there are some films of similar running time which are considerably more difficult to sit through. I guess this is sort of a cult feature(and it did somehow beget two sequels), and as such, some people will love it, but most people probably won't. I recommend this to big fans of gloomy, dystopian future works... if you're not one, you may find this rather uninteresting. 5\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"11 May 2008","score":"7 out of 14 people found the following review useful","review":" This movie is basically a typical, campy, B-grade action flick, from start to finish.

Maybe I should give it another watch now, but my intuition tells me it still sucks. Truth be told, Lethal Weapon 1 isn't an especially good movie, either, though the final installment (so far!) makes it look like a masterpiece. Mel Gibson and Danny Glover play chatterbox cops who are total opposites in life and style but, of course, are made partners. This probably wasn't the first buddy cop movie, but it is the most influential. Shane Black, who later went on to write and direct the superior Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, wrote a sometimes witty script which is also often ridiculous, repetitive, convoluted and just plain dumb. Richard Donner is one of the best popcorn directors, but a lot of Lethal Weapon feels overstuffed to me. There's just too much going on in many scenes, and the exaggerated performances of the two leads, along with their rapid-fire and frequently incomprehensible dialogue, I was getting a tad annoyed. But never that annoyed. With all its flaws, Lethal Weapon is nothing less than a good bit of entertainment.

To state 'Metro' is by far his most memorable attempt at a screenplay isn't really a compliment, it seems he always kept the 'screenplay writing for dummies' book by hand during his writing sessions. We have the typical hero-cop; underpaid, under-appreciated by his boss, personal problems galore,financial troubles to boost, a smirking sense of humor, and of course a personal investment in the investigation ('now it's personal -)). So we have the good cop with a revenge motive, but the chase isn't enough to fill the runtime. No, we also are forced to suffer - surprise, surprise - the obligatory (but in this case unfortunately also clumsily set up) love interest played by a young Carmen Ejogo. Sure; she's very easy on the eyes but as an actress she's sub-par. Then we have a fellow cop, lifelessly portrayed by Art Evans, and it must be said the poor fellow's been typecast, his role in the script is mainly to be victimized(also see Die Hard 2 for an almost identical role). His monotone delivery and robot-like autopilot acting certainly didn't lift this film to a higher level, neither did Denis Arndt's one-dimensional police chief, the villain whose dialog consisted primarily of grunting or the gross of the side-characters for that matter. They are mainly present for giving us some insight in our lead's personal life (and some perspective) and of course to pitch for Eddie Murphy's jokes. The only roles that still spring to mind as I recollect on the movie today are Michael Rapaport and Donal Logue, both competently playing their respective roles.Other clichés for the fanatic cliché-spotters among you, the rain suddenly appearing when a tragic event happened both when Murphy's friend is murdered, as when there's an attempted murder on his girlfriend. Speaking of which, there's one cliché scene to build up the tension before the attempt, where we see Ejogo in a shoulder-shot frame as she puts on perfume in front of a bathroom mirror. She opens and closes the mirror\/cabinet two times, with tense music playing, as if any moment some creep will appear behind her (the best use of that sort of scene can be found at the end of 'Candyman').The action scenes felt very standard. The soundtrack bugged me to a lesser degree, it really couldn't make up its mind. The other big flaws are an OD of love story, a waste of plot opportunities (a lot more tactical SWAT stuff would've been welcome) and a lack of funny scenes (especially with the cop partners). But it is precisely that humor that keeps 'Metro' from totally falling apart, I'll never be Murphy's biggest fan but as a comedian he's far from mediocre (although we don't see his best work in this movie). I did appreciate the way they threw us off track time after time as to who (or what) Troy is, the restaurant scenes (with the implied marriage proposal) and the hostage negotiation training scene. Those scenes, and the opening hostage situation, made up 90% of the enjoyment level of 'metro' for me. In the end 'Metro' can be summed up as painfully (almost insultingly) mediocre but still enjoyable because of the humor involved.

He makes the absolute most of this role and is magnetic as corrupt narcotics cop Alonzo Harris. The main thing that I like about this performance is that Washington played it as a totally corrupt and unscrupulous man who once, a long time ago had wide-eyed principles of doing good and cleaning up the streets. But he lost his way to the point there is no redemption.In walks newly promoted young Detective Jake Hoyt (played superbly by Best Supporting nominee Ethan Hawke, who in reality has more screen time than Washington), Alonzo's new 'trainee'. Jake is who Alonzo used to be with a MAJOR difference...Jake is incorruptible! He refuses to give in to the seduction of the quick buck and giving up on humanity. And in the process, Jake is the one who proves to be the strongest of the pair. Even with his Oscar nom, I feel like Hawke's work goes unnoticed as he essentially is the true heart and anchor of the film. Jake could have easily come across as a fake, stereotypical, do-gooder character, but in the end, he makes the viewer believe in Jake's unflinching valor. We care BECAUSE OF Jake! Initially, a had a problem with the film taking place all in one day. While I still think that it's a bit unbelievable at times, I really appreciate how gritty and realistic many of the characters and situations translate to the screen. While there are hints of preachiness and convolution, the film still draws you into it's dangerous world in a very provocative way; it manages to stay a step ahead of the typical tale-of-the-streets, mainly due to many intense scenes and strong acting. I really didn't appreciate all of this when I first saw it, being totally awed by Washington's transfixing performance and ignoring how good a movie I was actually watching.Director Anton Fuqua did an amazing job not just with Washington and Hawke, but with the entire cast as well, with standouts being Scott Glenn (as the biggest street dealer in LA) and Cliff Curtis as a young Hispanic ganglord who actually shows signs of nobility. Addititonally, there are effective cameos by famous rapper-musicians Snoop Dogg, Dr. Dre, and Macy Gray. But the obvious standout is Washington, whose powerful performance wholeheartedly deserved the Oscar...And he got it!
