[{"date":"25 October 2015","score":"","review":" Gone in 60 seconds (2000) is my favorite Action heist film of a cars and a car thief. Angelina Jolie in this film is fantastic, I seriously love her so much! I love her character. This is one of my favorite Nicolas Cage films and my favorite films about cars alongside with The Fast and the Furious.Don't expect a bullet-proof plot, but the cars and the action complement a surprisingly captivating storyline. Nicolas Cage gives a great performance as Memphis Raines, trying to help younger brother Kip Raines (also played well by Giovanni Ribisi) out of trouble. The supporting cast provides some great comedy as well. All in all, this is a movie you'll be able to watch over and over.This movie is downright one of the best movies I have ever seen. If you like fast cars you will love this awesome movie. A lot of people hate this film, I don't. I love it. I have enjoy watching this movie, when it come out and I think Nicholas Cage did a great job portraying Randall Memphis Raines a legendary car thief who has to back in action and steal 50. cars in one night for saving his brother. The action scenes and chase scenes are fantastic. This film is more about fast cars, been an auto mechanic, I was surprised that Angelina Jolie was an car mechanic in here, and she did a wonderful job as cast supporter. Delroy Lindo as Det. Roland Castlebeck was outstanding as a smart cop who will stop at nothing to bust Memphis at all cost.The pros try to steal the 50 cars. Delroy Lindo, as the cop, knows who they are and what they plan to do, but wants to catch them at it. He intuits that the key theft will be of a 1967 Shelby GT 350 Mustang, a car Memphis both loves and fears. He'll save that for the last, says Lindo, planning to nab him in the act. This decision means that 49 cars will already have been stolen before Memphis moves on the Mustang I love this film to death It is my favorite car flick alongside with The Fast and The Furious (2001)! I don't care what anyone says I will always love this film no matter what! Gone in 60 Seconds is like a practice game between the varsity and the reserves. Everybody plays pretty well, but they're saving up for Saturday. First team is Nicolas Cage, Delroy Lindo and Robert Duvall. Second team is Giovanni Ribisi, Will Patton and Angelina Jolie, who gets second billing but not much playing time. There are lots of subs who come off the bench for a play or two. This is the kind of movie that ends up playing on the TV set over the bar in a better movie.A legendary car booster thinks he left the fast lane behind him until he's forced out of retirement to save his kid brother from the wrath of an evil mobster. It is nothing less than a full throttle race to pull off the ultimate car heist 50 exotic beauties in 24 hours -- and the cops are already onto them! Randall Memphis Raines long ago abandoned his life of crime, but after an ominous visit from an old friend, he finds he has no choice but to return to what he does best - stealing cars - in order to save his brother's life. It all comes down to one night, 50 cars and a contract. A true automobile aficionado, Memphis has a burning passion for cars. Fuel-injected, high-performance, v-8, v-12, turbo-charged, loaded or stripped to the bare essentials, he knows and loves every nut and bolt, every gleaming piece of chrome. Memphis is a car thief of legendary proportion. No fancy lock or alarm can stop him; your car will be there and gone in 60 seconds. For years, Memphis eluded the law while boosting every make and model imaginable, with the exception of one elusive car, his beloved Eleanor, a 1967 Shelby Mustang GT 500. When the heat became too intense, he left everything and everyone he loved to find a different life. But when his kid brother tries to follow in his footsteps only to become dangerously embroiled in a high-stakes caper, Memphis is sucked back into his old life, tearing up the streets for one last death-defying heist.Gone in 60 Seconds is a 2000 American action heist film, starring Nicolas Cage, Angelina Jolie, Giovanni Ribisi, Christopher Eccleston, Robert Duvall, Vinnie Jones, and Will Patton.

This served as ample time, however, to allow her to accuse Mr. Arbuckle of rape. She had done this before, but William Randolph Hearts' publishing empire, looking for a scandal picked up the story, resulting in three murder trials and the ultimate acquittal of Mr. Arbuckle. He never appeared on film again. So too is the backstory of the film Brainstorm, Douglas Trumbull's accidental magnum opus. It is impossible to tell the story of, or review this film without mentioning the drowning death of it's star vehicle Natalie Wood, near the end of its filming. I will leave you to your own research if you wish to learn more about those tragic events. At the beginning of an albeit shortened career, Christopher Walken heavily uses cues from Ms. Wood, and the fantastic character actor Louise Fletcher, who turns in her best performance in this film. And while the creepy editing which allowed for the completion of a film whose star died part way through filming, the scandal made it hard to watch in theaters, especially as much of the audience suspected Mr. Walken of knowing more than he was saying publicly regarding the death of his co-star. One wonders, as great as this film is, how great it might have been without the scandal. One also wonders if the audience knew how remarkably accurate Trumbull predicts future technology, if that would have made a difference. But now, 32 years later, with Christopher Walken again on everybody's top actor list thanks to his Quentin Tarantino sponsored revival, and the scandal just a spec in history's rearview mirror, this film stands on it's own, and it is remarkable. The story is about the development and use of a technology that allows people to record their thoughts an feelings on a device using a 300 baud modem and optical tape library. So we suspend disbelief a little for that. Walken is the junior partner to Fletcher who leads the project, Cliff Robertson directs the project from a corporate and funding level. Robertson is so good at this role, that having worked in a similar environment makes my skin crawl. The two scientists live in the newly developed Research Triangle Park, which serves as the perfect setting for this strange and wonderful research. Natalie Wood also works for the same company, and at the beginning of the film is in the process of divorcing Walken whose creationis obsession with the project has resulted in their separation. While planning their divorce, they also work together in the development of the device that will bring it out of the lab to the consumer. Wood, in an empowering role for a woman at the time, plays a major role in breathing life into this product. As the film continues to focus on how the characters react to the existence of the new technology, Robert Trumbull puts his unique stamp on the evolution of the product, taking us through the production, data storage and even cyber security issues surrounding the technology. With the photography, lighting, and soundtrack all spot on, we are whisked away into this world of technology that in 1983 was just a fantasy, but seems very real today, almost as though we are actually viewing a true account. Sadly it is hard say what Robert Trumbull may have gone on to do had this film been met more favorably. But just as Altman had his Shortcuts, Paul Thomas Anderson has his Magnolia, Robert Trumbull has Brainstorm, clearly a very personal and special film.

After dying in the electric chair the killer manages to force his spirit into the bodies of others via electricity.SHOCKER was meant for the horror legend as an attempt to start up a new series since the Freddy Krueger character had gone into directions that he didn't really like. Sadly for Craven and the viewer the end result is somewhat of a mess. SHOCKER starts off decent enough but it quickly falls apart during it's second half and there are just way too many problems for the film to work.I think the majority of the blame has to go towards Craven's screenplay. The film starts off as some sort of weird thriller with elements of A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET. The entire thing dealing with Jonathan seeing the killer just didn't work. To make matters worse is that the second half with the spirit jumping is just downright stupid and it never becomes believable to the point where you can get caught up in what's going on. Another problem is that the film clocks in at 109 minutes, which is about twenty minutes to long. There are so many stretches of boring stuff that you can't help but wish Craven had cut it down.Both Berg and Murphy deliver good performances and their relationship is certainly the best thing about the story and it helps keep you somewhat entertained. Pileggi easily steals the picture as the foul serial killer and it's really too bad the entire film wasn't based around him. Once the spirit jumping happens it takes the actor out of the material and the film flat-lines. SHOCKER features a nice score and some interesting ideas but they just never come together.
