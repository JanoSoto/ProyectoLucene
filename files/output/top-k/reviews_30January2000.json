We hardly get to know the characters throughout the entire movie, except for their main quality (this one's smart, this one's a hero, this one's crazy).  Also, we are thrust right into the story, without much of an exposition.

We know the facts behind the reason of his death, but why even have him in the movie if he's only in there for about 15 minutes?(WARNING Spoiler)Another thing what's with the artifact?  It had so much potential (after all, the things 9-dimensional!).  But again, it was wasted, as the only thing it's good for is blowing up a star.  Which brings me to my next point...(WARNING Major spoiler)The supernova sucked.  Picture the explosion created by a dying blue giant, hundreds of times larger than our sun.  Picture the shockwave vaporizing anything and everything in its path.  Picture the heroes desperately trying to escape.  Now picture the whole thing lasting for about 5 seconds.  What a HUGE disappointment.  Also, the computer aboard the ship says the resulting explosion will reach Earth in 51 years, and will either destroy our planet, or create new life.  But do we get to find out what happens?  No.  All we get is the fact that the two survivors switched an eyeball each, and the woman is pregnant.  Whoopee.  In summary, this movie is like a 31 chapter book.  The director decides to start on chapter 2, and then skips every other chapter, effectively missing both the beginning and the end.

As he tries to seduce Annette he falls in love with her, and the plot just twists and twists, in fact the whole movie is bloody twisted, but damn good. Also in the movie, Cecile (Blair) falls in love with her cello teacher, who falls in love with her too. Her mother disapproves. Kathryn wants to get revenge at Cecile since she is the reason her past boyfriend dumped her. So she impersonates herself pretending to be Cecile's friend, when in fact she's the one who has the real cruel intentions.The acting was very good. Geller gave a great performance and Phillippe did too, though hers was a bit better. Blair and Witherspoon also gave great performances.

By the end of the film, you KNOW those guys, and that is one of the most important aspects of filmmaking as a whole.

I have seen virtually every single one of Stephen King's films and have read roughly 30 of his novels, and I think that The Green Mile was by far the best screen adaptation of any of his books, as well as one of the most intellectual and thought provoking stories.Tom Hanks is an incredible actor, and he played a very convincing supervisory prison guard. The fact that the film was so long gave the audience an excellent opportunity to see what kinds of people the characters are. By the end of the film, you KNOW those guys, and that is one of the most important aspects of filmmaking as a whole. The audience needs to feel a connection with the characters, they need to care about them. It is heartbreaking to see Tom Hanks' character Paul Edgecomb in such pain because of his urinary infection, and when John Coffey cures it, you feel so grateful for it that it may as well have been your own infection.

Narrated by Kevin Spacey's character, Lester Burnham, the story relates the melodramas, micro-dramas, and hidden inner lives of suburban America, culminating in an explosive climax.Lester, at the start of the film, tells that he's going to die, so in one sense the film, as it approaches the end, becomes something of a whodunnit. But it's so much more. At the start of the film Lester is barely alive, merely going through the motions of his humdrum suburban life. Quite frankly, and by his own admission, he's a loser. However he's shaken out of his torpor by an encounter with the son of the new neighbours, Ricki, and the sight of his daughter's friend, Angela, with whom he becomes fixated. Overhearing a conversation between the two girls, he decides through sheer force of will, to become a different man - an iron-pumping, dope-smoking, employer-blackmailing übermensch.This both shocks and disturbs his uptight realtor wife, who seems to have traded in the bloom of youth for security, a big house, and a front garden full of red roses. No longer able to bust her husband's balls, she finds her own diversions, forcing her and Lester even further apart.Meanwhile Ricki from next door has captivated the younger Burnham, Jane, and struck a profitable relationship with Lester. But his Marine colonel father, a barely suppressed cauldron of violence and conflicting emotions, is watching him, and eventually jumps to the wrong conclusion, setting off the climactic chain of events...American Beauty is almost perfect. Almost. My only qualm is with the death of Lester. We know he's going to die, but by the end of the movie we don't want him to, as we've come to love the guy for his beauty and humanity. He transgresses the rules of suburban life by striking out and going his own way. So is the film a morality play? Is Lester ultimately paying the price for not playing by the rules? Is the film adhering to another Hollywood convention? If so, it sucks.Personally, I don't believe this is film's intention, but the result does mean supporting a conservative morality. This is a shame, because no doubt the Right will use the film to draw the conclusion that if you break the rules, you have to pay the price.I don't think that I like the destination, but Lester and co took us on one hell of a journey.

Also, the director's cut is better than the original, as the ending felt like it was just added on to please audiences, whilst Harrison Ford's voice over blocked out some of the excellent music.

There is real loyalty and love here, and a sense of life and joy, best expressed in the scene where Brody plays Baba O'Reilly by The Who.

Sure, if I were editing, I'd cut down on some of the kiddie love scenes but I understand that the director is working with this for the added layers it gives.  Very lyrical... beautifully photographed, definitely deserves an Oscar nomination for cinematography.  Max von Sydow provides some of the best lawyer scenes ever,  and sure ... Ethan Hawke is not a strong male lead... but I don't think the role calls for a dynamic male lead--that's one of the things that unfolds as the plot develops... without giving any plot away, I'd say that Hawke is effective in his role.

Since I'm a student, I didn't have to pay a dime. I had wanted to see this movie a few months ago when it came out, but time didn't permit.Previous writers have written in on the gaping plot holes in this movie, the recycled performance of Tommy Lee Jones, and even the absurdity of the title, considering that the Double Jeopardy clause to the 5th Amendment to the Constitution has nothing to do with wrongful convictions, only acquittals. They're all right. The premise of the film started out as ridiculous, and the plot was contrived beyond believability. I read the comments above and shrugged and said So what? In most of the movies I've seen Tommy Lee Jones in, he is essentially the same character, with just a few tweaks here and there. Take a good long look, and you'll notice that Travis Lehmen in this movie is a carbon copy of Brad Little from Firebirds, Sam Gerard from The Fugitive and US Marshals, Mike Roark from Volcano, Agent Kay from Men In Black. Jones CAN stretch his style when his scriptwriters give him something that calls for it, (see Under Siege, Batman Forever, JFK and April Morning), but most casting people seem to want to give Jones the gruff and taciturn roles. Scriptwriters meanwhile bless him with lines that can be hilarious, inflammatory or dead serious, but will all be delivered in Jones' trademark semi-bored voice, usually without his face cracking a smile. If Jones is okay with this trend, I'm okay with it. It doesn't do much for variety, but a little familiarity is good every now and then.As for Ashley Judd well, I thought she was enjoyable to watch while she was hyperventilating on the dock. Granted she might get sick at any minute, but she'd look good doing it. I'll refrain from commenting on her acting, since I'm obviously biased, sucker for a pretty face that I am. Whether it was good or bad, it will almost always be good to me. Bruce Greenwood played his part well, as an utterly contemptible money grubbing scoundrel. By the time the action moved to Louisiana, I was actively rooting for his violent death.The movie has a heroine that's lovely to watch, a hero that's fun to watch, and bad guy that's easy to hate. Couple that with a few good one liners, and nice photography of the boat and of Louisiana, and I think it's an enjoyable movie. Granted it's silly and unrealistic, but I for one can look past that, given it's assets. I'd recommend this movie for Judd fans and Jones fans, just not for serious crime drama fans.
