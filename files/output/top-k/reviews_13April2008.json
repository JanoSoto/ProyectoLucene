I registered myself just so i can comment on this film. as a Chinese who has grown up with Wuxia films and loves the genre very much, i felt i needed to put my two cents worth. after reading about 1000 comments here, there are a few things to be clarified. first off, this is NOT a martial arts film. this is a DRAMA infused with martial arts. 'wirefu' is something common in wuxia films and even those like once upon a time in china, etc... secondly, the fact that they 'fly' is something we Chinese fantasy movie-goers don't even question so imagine my surprise when i find out the main dissenters complain of the implausibility of flying in a movie like this. given, when i first watched this film i was slightly disappointed because of the over-hype, and i thought the 'flying' bit was done a bit too easily, but the thing that sets this film apart from your regular wuxia film of the late '80s and early '90s is the acting. it's very westernized in that sense, something unique since prior to this i certainly didn't watch wuxia films for the acting. it was mostly for the jin Yong-esquire plots. however, this movie grows on you with repeated watching. at first i thought zhang ziyi was the scene stealer, but now i know it's really Michelle yeoh who's the powerhouse. her eyes... man, anyone who's not blind can see how deeply she yearns from Li mu bai. and at first i thought chow yuan fat was a bit too... well, chow yuan fat, in that he didn't bring anything new to this and seemed so cold towards Michelle's character but i've come to realise he had to play it that way or else the two would have been together right from the start. very strong supporting cast. and the story seems superficially simple but really, it's multi-layered as are the characters. just use your brain and imagination for once. thank you Ang for not spoon feeding us. after a while, i've accepted Ang lee's vision of wuxia, which is slightly different from our wuxia films, and certainly nothing most westerners have seen. i envy them because now they can be enthralled as i once was by classics like bride with white hair, swordsman 2, ashes of time (which i thought was very similar to this), dragon inn... the list is near endless. only superficial people will think this movie is plot less and think it's just about retrieving a stolen sword. there's so much more and it all depends on the viewer's willingness to participate in the film. I'm also surprised how i did not pick up the feminist themes, i should have, but i put it down to the fact that most Chinese films (think Brigitte Lin and Michelle yeoh films - and a whole lot more) have strong female characters, so it felt like another Chinese film. and the funniest part is how ppl say this is a matrix and star wars copycat. get your facts straight, Joel Schumacher hired yen woo ping so obviously they were influenced by hk cinema, and George Lucas referenced Chinese folklore so there you go. i'm also amused how foreigners draw analogies from star wars, peter pan, etc. i'm sorry guys, you have been deprived. the genre isn't new, but an lee made it his own. and i thank him profusely for reigniting the genre which has died out since Brigitte Lin retired. i think this film should have gotten best picture only because that Oscar year was crap, my reservations due to the fact that wuxia isn't new, but Michelle yeoh was robbed of an Oscar nod. so sad. it's so easy to overlook her because she wasn't given the opportunity to run free as zhang ziyi's character could, but her soulful eyes, fierce combat, and having to do this in a language that's nearly completely foreign to her. i don't mind her accent since i'm a 'banana' myself-yellow on the outside, white on the inside. her performance was so minimalist and nuanced, in stark contrast with her fight scenes, i hope the woman never retires! it's also sad how ppl give this a 1 star rating just to bring down the overall rank. childish. again, this is not a martial arts film, it's a drama take on the wuxia genre. so stop drawing comparisons with Jackie Chan. it's like asking why wasn't there a car chase in gladiator?

That can be said about THE DEER HUNTER by Michael Cimino, a psychological film at various levels of analysis, an entertainment with marvelous performances and visuals and a piece of cinematic work that constitutes a true insight into the decadence of war and, foremost, its harmful influence. Let me look at these aspects in more details.I have encountered few movies that really did so much for the thought provoking character development. THE DEER HUNTER is really a pioneer in this case. Of course, this development goes in pairs with long moments but is it possible to get to know someone, understand their decisions and actions without stopping for a while? From the very beginning, we have an image of who the characters are, what their dreams are, what their relations are built upon. They visit bars, sing popular songs, drink beer, sometimes behave obscenely but know basic responsibilities by working hard in the factory and getting married. Among them is a true deer hunting buff Michael (Robert DeNiro) who does not skip any opportunity to go to the mountains and shoot the deer. Steven (John Savage) gets married to Angela and what a wedding it is! Nick (Christopher Walken) also has a girlfriend, Linda (Meryl Streep), and plans a life with her, the rest, including Stan, Axel live rather light hearted lives. Yet, politics steps in and Mike, Nick and Steven leave for Vietnam. There, they see what life in hatred is. There, they realize what experiencing war really means. There, they start to miss terribly, miss their families, miss their dreams, miss their homeland Pennsylvania, miss America. Although some are lucky to come back, life's no longer the same. There is a lifelong impact of fighting on the psyche of young men. Killing the deer no longer seems to be so simple, using gun is no longer such fun... since can life, though filled with medals and courage, remain the same after the horror of war? That character development and character change appear to reach such a genuine level that we, as viewers, are constantly surprised with the things the characters do. In real life, we are also surprised with people's actions because, as we know them, we usually do not expect them to do this or that. The same genuine reaction is when watching the film it seems that we know them and, despite this fact, they appear to surprise us.But except for this purely psychological aspect of the movie (and historical one in the background), the director flawlessly manages to supply the viewer with visual marvels. I will never forget the stunning moment of deer hunting the mountains, blissful landscapes, subtle soundtrack do make a haunting effect. It is also important to mention the symbolic aspect of visuals. Among them, there is one technically brilliant moment when Nick is in hospital and we see a big American flag. In a while, the camera directs our attention towards background coffins. Naturally, everyone who notices this is led to a sort of reflection can war mean anything else, anything more than just the destruction of life, the night of humanity? But nice and memorable moments also include wit. Don't skip the pack of friends visiting bars and mountains.The performances are brilliant from all of the cast. Robert DeNiro does a terrific job as Mike. He is a sort of macho who is also ready for tears and prayer and whose character is mostly touched by the horrific sadness and despair. Christopher Walken portrays Nick, an exceptionally interesting character absorbed by a trap of the Russian roulette that leads him to personal tragedy... Meryl Streep is beautiful and talented as Linda who looks for love. Her behavior seems to be unfair for Nick yet, it proves her quest for love. The character that always touches me is Steven portrayed by John Savage. His terrible fate in Vietnam brings him to life on wheelchair; yet, finally, he does not lose a smile and optimism.Finally, despite the fact that really much has been said about the movie, I sort of categorized its viewers. It appears that a group of people have criticized it, other group have praised it, and very few viewers remained indifferent. It means that you are bound to evaluate it, you are more likely to be for or against it than stay neutral. One of the reasons for that radical view appears to be the powerful message of Cimino's movie. WHAT, in fact, ARE WAR AND KILLING? I personally consider THE DEER HUNTER one of the thought provoking pearls that says with power NO MORE WAR... not keeping in mind the idea of war that the hippies spread in the 1960s but the idea of war preceded by lifelong reflections of many people who have seen what this horror means and what impact it has on life and psyche. A highly recommended movie!Yes, let us sing in the final prayer of the movie with the survivors God Bless America and lead this country out of darkness of terrorism into light of the mountains, lakes and prairies, into the light bringing a new dawn of peace.

There, they start to miss terribly, miss their families, miss their dreams, miss their homeland Pennsylvania, miss America. Although some are lucky to come back, life's no longer the same. There is a lifelong impact of fighting on the psyche of young men. Killing the deer no longer seems to be so simple, using gun is no longer such fun... since can life, though filled with medals and courage, remain the same after the horror of war? That character development and character change appear to reach such a genuine level that we, as viewers, are constantly surprised with the things the characters do. In real life, we are also surprised with people's actions because, as we know them, we usually do not expect them to do this or that. The same genuine reaction is when watching the film it seems that we know them and, despite this fact, they appear to surprise us.But except for this purely psychological aspect of the movie (and historical one in the background), the director flawlessly manages to supply the viewer with visual marvels. I will never forget the stunning moment of deer hunting the mountains, blissful landscapes, subtle soundtrack do make a haunting effect. It is also important to mention the symbolic aspect of visuals. Among them, there is one technically brilliant moment when Nick is in hospital and we see a big American flag. In a while, the camera directs our attention towards background coffins. Naturally, everyone who notices this is led to a sort of reflection can war mean anything else, anything more than just the destruction of life, the night of humanity? But nice and memorable moments also include wit. Don't skip the pack of friends visiting bars and mountains.The performances are brilliant from all of the cast. Robert DeNiro does a terrific job as Mike. He is a sort of macho who is also ready for tears and prayer and whose character is mostly touched by the horrific sadness and despair. Christopher Walken portrays Nick, an exceptionally interesting character absorbed by a trap of the Russian roulette that leads him to personal tragedy... Meryl Streep is beautiful and talented as Linda who looks for love. Her behavior seems to be unfair for Nick yet, it proves her quest for love. The character that always touches me is Steven portrayed by John Savage. His terrible fate in Vietnam brings him to life on wheelchair; yet, finally, he does not lose a smile and optimism.Finally, despite the fact that really much has been said about the movie, I sort of categorized its viewers. It appears that a group of people have criticized it, other group have praised it, and very few viewers remained indifferent. It means that you are bound to evaluate it, you are more likely to be for or against it than stay neutral. One of the reasons for that radical view appears to be the powerful message of Cimino's movie. WHAT, in fact, ARE WAR AND KILLING? I personally consider THE DEER HUNTER one of the thought provoking pearls that says with power NO MORE WAR... not keeping in mind the idea of war that the hippies spread in the 1960s but the idea of war preceded by lifelong reflections of many people who have seen what this horror means and what impact it has on life and psyche. A highly recommended movie!Yes, let us sing in the final prayer of the movie with the survivors God Bless America and lead this country out of darkness of terrorism into light of the mountains, lakes and prairies, into the light bringing a new dawn of peace.

One's first inclination would be to dismiss it as a goody two-shoes, 'save the rain forests' diatribe, and on top of that, it makes us sit through yet another on-screen relationship where the man and woman can't stand each other at first and then fall in love. I almost gave up on it about ten minutes in, after listening to Lorraine Bracco bitch about everything in sight with a nails-on-chalkboard New York accent. But both those characterizations turn out to be unfair and false. The movie actually accepts the inevitability of at least part of the rain forest being paved over; its complaint is much smaller and tightly defined- it's saying, at least wait till we've replicated the cancer serum that Sean Connery's Dr. Campbell discovered and then lost. And Campbell and Dr. Crane (Bracco) never fall in love. I don't think they ever even kiss. It's difficult to say exactly what kind of relationship they end up having, except that it's a lot of fun to watch. Ultimately, it's easy to say with certainty what is so right about 'Medicine Man.' It's Sean Connery's performance, and it is magnificent. While this is not the best movie he's ever been in (no question there), I really believe this might be his greatest acting job. It is subtle, nuanced, powerful, humorous... he has a way with the dialogue that makes it utterly believable, and his portrayal of Campell is also a very physical one. When he gets angry, his anger is incredibly palpable, both to be heard and seen. There is not a false note in it. He even raises the level of the requisite tit-for-tat back-and-forth arguments with Bracco's Crane to something more genuine and meaningful. There is a grace in his physical movements that is very natural, even in the brief fight scene toward the end. Everything he does seems real. And Lorraine Bracco, as it turns out, compliments his performance with a fine one of her own. The script gives her many opportunities to flesh out Dr. Crane's character (or, as Campbell calls her, 'Dr. Bronx'), and she does so with a lot of high spirits and enthusiasm. One of the best scenes has her bouncing off the walls, figuratively speaking, from a local concoction very high in caffeine. The location camera-work is another wonderful part of 'Medicine Man.' This may be the closest any 2-D film has come to seeming three dimensional. When it rains, you almost feel as soaked as the characters on screen. And when Connery and Bracco go gliding on ropes and pulleys over the canopy, looking down at the treetops and miles of forest in the distance, the effect is breathtaking. The ending should be a downer but somehow 'Medicine Man' manages an epilogue to the depressing finale that is hopeful, uplifting and encouraging while not seeming the least bit contrived or manipulative.

I just do not get these guys, their humor and the ninnies who go see their films--and I have an excellent sense of humor.I will not re-hash the plot, but like to instead delve into the interesting nuances, especially Kevin Kline's performance. Was there ever a funnier performance in all of film than Kline's moronic assassin who reads Nietzche but is a Buddhist? I love at the beginning of the film, when he declares to his accomplices England is a fine country! and then quickly degenerates as the film progresses as a Brit-loathing Yank (...the filth of the planet!)I've always thought that, for a serious actor like Kline, it's harder to play a comedic role than a serious one. His facial expressions are reasons enough to give him the Oscar, which he deservedly won. It was nice to see the Academy awarding a rare comedic role.There are so many funny scenes in this film, but one of the best for me was when Otto caught Archie robbing his own house, and then finally apologized to him (while Archie was unconscious, of course). Another great scene occurred when Otto was caught by Archie's wife Wendy in their house, and then tries to explain that he's in the CIA. Absolutely hilarious! Especially when Wendy, the perfectionist, uptight Brit can remember Otto's false name, Mr. Man-fred-jin-sin-jin.Michael Palin was a scream as the dog-loving thief with the worst stutter you ever heard! The scenes with Palin and Kline and between Kline and Cleese were the best in the film for me.But I suppose that without the script, none of this magic would have occurred. So I must praise the comic genius of John Cleese, whose classic Fawlty Towers is one of my favorites of all time.This is a great comedy to cheer you up when you're feeling blue, about the relationship between Yanks and our British cousins across the pond.

What has become of comedies? I cannot believe people find Will Ferrell and Jim Carrey funny. I just do not get these guys, their humor and the ninnies who go see their films--and I have an excellent sense of humor.I will not re-hash the plot, but like to instead delve into the interesting nuances, especially Kevin Kline's performance. Was there ever a funnier performance in all of film than Kline's moronic assassin who reads Nietzche but is a Buddhist?

I adore his books, I think he is one of the most brilliant writers in the history of mankind and I have loved most of his films especially the ones that truly capture the King vibe. Maximum Overdrive does not fit this bill. Ironically enough it is THE ONLY Stephen King film written and directed by Stephen King himself as he touted that the best way to have King directed was to direct it himself. While I admit the film does have some King flare to it...the isolation, the small rag tag group hidden away from some monstrosity fighting against each other and the supernatural but the film itself is campy, and kind of stupid, and despite it's huge special effects and slightly disturbing plot line it just doesn't really fit the scare tactic. It's more corny and laughable than anything. All that being said Maximum Overdrive is not a complete wash. First of all the cast is fairly decent, they seem to fit into the King vibe fairly well and it's action is enough to keep you interested complete with laughs and some chills and some really gory kills. On top of that Maximum Overdrive has to the winner for most gratuitous use of GOD LORD etc and every various way you can use the Lord's name. It stands out like they did it on purpose. Definitely an R Rated film.Eighties super-kid Emilio Estevez takes the lead as the rough and tough bad boy hero. His character is very stereotypical and yet he is watchable in the role and adds enough to the film to keep it interesting. It's just no great acting feat for him and he can act. Pat Hingle is terrific as the snarly, egotistical diner owner who immediately butts heads with Estevez. Hingle's cowboy type villain is one of the best characters in the film. Laura Harrington is the typical eighties eye candy gal but she does get a little more substance. She's rough around the edges, independent and very tom boyish right down to her name but seduces Estevez into bed...well a cot in the back of the diner\/gas station. She is a little more active than just eye candy actually putting forth a hero type effort and her and Estevez are not bad together. Not a force of nature or anything. Yeardley Smith (now best known as Lisa Simpson) plays torturingly annoying Connie who is supposed to be that way and man is she ever. She is one half of the Newlywed team stuck in the station and her voice is like nails on a chalk board. She's the damsel in distress type and Smith does play the role I think it was supposed to be so kudos to her I suppose. John Short is her new husband, Curtis. I would have liked to have seen more from his character as he does turn out a rather heroic performance and he's kind of underused compared to the other characters and I think he has a really good character and could have pulled off more to it.Most horror fans really do appreciate a good campy flick and that is exactly what Maximum Overdrive is. I mean you can't help but laugh in horror as all these electrical appliances start murdering people everywhere and these massive transport trucks stage a revolution against this tiny gas bar with these people inside. The kills are plenty gruesome and you almost start to see personality in the various trucks especially the Goblin truck which appears to be the leader of this crew. Somehow the story really does make you feel like these things have individual personalities and you start to feel the claustrophobia that comes from a Stephen King story but it won't ever freak you out because the film is completely laughable and darkly comic but you know I would watch it again because it doesn't try to be anything but. King really didn't do anything spectacular with this one and only directing debut. I mean you can see a little of his style but I think Mick Garris has captured more King style than this film does. I still would love to King come back to the helm for something he is passionate about but until then we can enjoy and laugh off this eighties cult classic. 7\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"13 April 2008","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" I love Stephen King.

Since Garrison arrived at the scene, these terrible events at Dallas had since then been a subject for conspiracy theories and it intensified when this film came out 28 years later. In spite of all those endless conspiracy theories about the assassination, it seems obvious there was no conspiracy. Now what about the film itself? Being directed by Oliver Stone, many of Oliver Stone's films focusing real life events have since then become subjects for love\/hate theories and JFK is a classic example due to the fact that it is notorious for lots of inaccuracies as shown on such website; The Assassination Goes To Hollywood. The film is also misleading for the showing of Garrison as a hero searching for the truth but by the look of the real Garrison, he was actually some sort of oddball probably seeking publicity. Even the weaknesses of Stone's JFK can be traced to its filming stages when the press began to get their claws out claiming Garrisons's investigations to be a fraud and saying that Garrison was a bizarre DA from New Orleans whom said that the assassination was carried out as part of the CIA cover-up, he even managed to put a hapless man on trial. Not surprisingly, Garrison having no case lost in court. At nearly 3.5 hours in length, the film is too long and had initially became a turn-off by some family members due to considerable use of bad language. It seems to be without doubt that with a twisted mind, Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone and had once attempted to assassinate General Edwin Walker. Oswald took employment at Deeley Plaza and some close-up cine clips on the youtube website of the shooting showed that it can only come from that direction and not from Grassy Knoll as the film seems to claim. Oswald gained shooting skills while serving as a marine that took him to the early days of the Cold War regime in the Soviet Union and was the only known person to have bolted from Deeley Plaza shortly after the shooting and had been initially been charged with the murder of JD Tippit and then Kennedy.

I knew what would happen in the end then and there itself. No matter how perfectly the 2 high-schoolers carried out the murder, erasing every trace of evidence and planting new ones to deliberately throw the investigative team off the track, it just wasn't convincing enough. It was only a matter of time - an hour and a half more in this case - to nab the two after a nail biting and cliff-hanger kind of an end. Predictable stuff. Even though the performances are good, it is unable to hold the story together at all because there isn't one. This is a thriller, a murder mystery, but I never felt being pushed to the edge of my seat anytime while watching it. On one hand, Ryan and Michael go on with their murderous antics while the other track moves back and forth justifying Sandra's tough cookie image and her apparent vulnerable side. I didn't need this if all I wanted was to know about the 2 highly dysfunctional kids. If the movie would have delved into the psyche of these two guys, the nature of their relationship with each other, with others and why exactly such intellectually gifted kids can even think of committing murders out of sheer boredom and just for attracting attention, it would actually have freaked me out. And I would have been glad; because this is how I expect such movies to make me feel. Expectedly, even though the movie can boast of good lead actors, they are not able to hold the movie together because it is the plot that should be doing this and there isn't any here. A real disappointment indeed.

No matter how perfectly the 2 high-schoolers carried out the murder, erasing every trace of evidence and planting new ones to deliberately throw the investigative team off the track, it just wasn't convincing enough. It was only a matter of time - an hour and a half more in this case - to nab the two after a nail biting and cliff-hanger kind of an end. Predictable stuff. Even though the performances are good, it is unable to hold the story together at all because there isn't one. This is a thriller, a murder mystery, but I never felt being pushed to the edge of my seat anytime while watching it. On one hand, Ryan and Michael go on with their murderous antics while the other track moves back and forth justifying Sandra's tough cookie image and her apparent vulnerable side. I didn't need this if all I wanted was to know about the 2 highly dysfunctional kids. If the movie would have delved into the psyche of these two guys, the nature of their relationship with each other, with others and why exactly such intellectually gifted kids can even think of committing murders out of sheer boredom and just for attracting attention, it would actually have freaked me out. And I would have been glad; because this is how I expect such movies to make me feel. Expectedly, even though the movie can boast of good lead actors, they are not able to hold the movie together because it is the plot that should be doing this and there isn't any here. A real disappointment indeed.

Most of his other output has horror elements, but Mimic was an actual creature feature. What I had seen of Mimic had never impressed me, but I figured I owed it to the great director to see this early studio work. I wish I hadn't. This is not the del Toro that we know and love. This is another example of the Weinstein's scooping up young talent and botching the finished product. Mimic takes place in a world where cockroaches are carrying a plague that is wiping out a generation of children in New York City. Enter CDC frontman Jeremy Northam and bug expert Mira Sorvino to fix the situation. They create a new breed of bug, the Judas breed, to infiltrate the cockroaches and kill them off. The Judas breed themselves have a short life span so as to die off quickly and put Mother Nature back to rights. Like any good creature feature, this is not the case. The Judas breed evolve and begin to mimic their natural predators Man. This leads to your standard Aliens territory that we've all been privy to many times before. The staleness of the last act is not the only problem here. Sorvino and Northam have no chemistry at all, and co-stars Josh Brolin, F. Murrey Abraham, and Charles S. Dutton are completely wasted. While Mimic is clearly a victim of studio tampering, it's still a blight on the wonderful career of Guillermo del Toro. May it be the only one. Rent any of his other pictures and let's forget this one ever happened.

I think of it the same way that Bette Davis says about Dark Victory that the role of Judith Traherne is 98% of me. Like the film's Jack Burns Kirk Douglas has charted his own way through life in Hollywood the way Jack Burns does. Burns's problem is that he's a man born a century too late.Run another of Kirk Douglas's classic westerns Man Without A Star side by side. Dempsey Rae in that film isn't too much different from Jack Burns, in fact they have opinions on certain subjects almost identical.But the frontier that Dempsey dealt with in that film has changed, it just doesn't exist any more. But Burns won't recognize it. I'm also not so sure how much film and television have influenced 1962's Jack Burns in the way a cowboy should behave.Kirk is returning to his home town from God knows what and meets up with Gena Rowlands who is married to his best friend Michael Kane. Kane's in jail for helping illegal immigrants cross the US\/Mexican border. What to do but be a cowboy hero and bust him from jail. So Kirk gets himself in a nasty bar fight with one armed Bill Raisch and gets tossed in sheriff Walter Matthau's jail. While there Deputy George Kennedy works him over.So when Kirk's ready to bust jail, Kane refuses to go to his surprise. But that doesn't stop Kirk who breaks loose and the chase is on.The non-conformist part of Jack Burns certainly must have appealed to Kirk Douglas. He invests so much of himself in Burns it's hard to tell where Kirk leaves off and Burns begins. And he's one of the most appealing of all the roles Kirk Douglas has. You root for this law breaking maverick every step of the way.Mention must also go to Walter Matthau as the wise and laconic sheriff who really does understand Douglas's mentality as no one else really does. In a lot of ways it's like the Charles Bronson classic Death Hunt where Mountie Lee Marvin truly is sorry he's on this particular job. Of course if Douglas had actually killed someone in eluding the law, Matthau's duty would have been clear.The ending is truly an ironic one as the cowboy loses that part of him that makes him a unique American icon. Absolutely don't miss Lonely Are The Brave when it is broadcast, especially fans of Kirk Douglas.
