But Indiana Jones isn't a mere mortal. He puts up with this silly bint and then later embraces her. I just hope the sex was worth it.Of course, according to Willie Scott (the character Capshaw plays), she's most certainly worth it. In one scene, where Indy and Willie are deciding who's going to swallow their pride and make the first move for a night of sweet, sweet love, she says to herself that she could have been his greatest adventure. Yeah, the Ark of the Covenant and the Holy Grail kind of pale in comparison to getting between the sheets of some bimbo.But as annoying as she is in this film, maybe Kate Capshaw's character serves some purpose. Without her the film would be pretty grim, as Temple of Doom is unrelentingly dark.The image I always think of when I think of Temple of Doom is of the man having his heart ripped out. Okay, this is a kid's film and a man is having his heart ripped out and he's being sacrificed and then we see the main bad guy laughing as the man's heart beats in his hand and catches fire. This is the stuff of nightmares.Other crazy stuff in this film includes children being whipped by burly psychos, blood being poured down the neck of Indiana Jones via a scary looking skull with a nasty tongue lolling out of it and crocodiles tearing people to shreds. No wonder it prompted the MPAA to create the PG-13 rating.But the darkness isn't a drawback. In fact, the darkness is what saves it. Otherwise it's just kind of silly. And yes, it's meant to be lightweight genre film, but it doesn't have the excitement of Raiders of the Lost Ark or the heart of Last Crusade. So therefore the horror elements are what keep me going back to the film.That being said, even though the action isn't anywhere near as good as the action in Raiders, I do love a couple of the sequences. The scene with the spikes coming from the ceiling is fantastic &#150; it's full of tension, yet it's also incredibly funny. In particular I like Indy's berating of Willie for not being able to help him properly. In order to save them she has to pull a lever, but because it's full of bugs she's understandably reluctant to do it. So as she dithers we first see Indy shaking his fist at her through a small hole, and then Harrison Ford mugs like crazy for the camera as he says, 'We are going to die.' It's a line delivery that has made me laugh since I was ten.Another very enjoyable sequence is the opening teaser. We see Indy bargaining with some hoods as he tries to sell a valuable antique to them. He eventually makes a sale and then celebrates by having a drink. We then find out that the drink is poisoned and that the vial one of the hoods is holding contains the antidote. First off, I love the silliness of the revolving table. Secondly, it cracks me up that Indy has a sidekick who gets killed in ten seconds. But most of all I love the fact that the villains carry an antidote with them. Surely if you're going to poison someone, you want to keep any antidote about a million miles away. You don't want to give them a chance to live. But no, like fools they bring it along and wave it in Indy's face. Oh, and another thing. I love the fact that one of the hoods gets killed when Indiana Jones spears him with a flaming kebab skewer. Shish kebab anyone? And this leads to the magnificently silly sequence on the plane where the pilots jump out and leave our heroes alone without any parachutes &#150; I love the way that the pilot, as he's making his way out of the plane as the heroes sleep, cackles to himself and the way that the co-pilot dithers. And then you have the way that Indy and co jump out of an aeroplane on an inflatable dingy, and the way that it doesn't turn over in midair. It's ridiculous and over the top, but it's done with such gusto that you can't help but fall for it (pun not intended).The other action sequences are fun, but they're not quite as good. I mean, during the minecart sequence I'm always thinking to myself, 'why would you build a roller-coaster?' when you're trying to find some scared stones. For some reason, in that sequence, I can't suspend my disbelief. And the bridge sequence is pretty good, too, even though it's far from being the best set-piece. In particular I like the way that Mola Ram sacrifices his own men in a bid to escape &#150; when he's climbing the broken bridge he ruthlessly rips his men free and feeds them to the crocodiles. What a guy.But on the other hand there are things that annoy. The little Maharaja is prissy beyond belief. My ears bleed every time I hear him say, 'This will never happen again in my kingdom.' And the bug dinner is on the wrong side of stupid.But one tiny thing still pleases me all these years on. Listen to one of the villager's voices &#150; the underling of the head villager. The man who says, 'They took the stones from here.' It sounds like he's been inhaling helium. Having watched the film loads of times on TV and video, it still fascinates me.

The same giggly obsession of 8-year-old girls in the schoolyard matching up their schoolmates. It reminds me of an analogy with duplicate bridge where the same characters and elements can be played a different way each time and still lead to an arbitrary predetermined ending. Maybe there's a better analogy.When I was a kid the Saturday matinée had one feature left over from the 30s, which was a slapstick race. (The concept was later taken by Hanna &#150;Barbera and turned into Wacky Racers.) Tickets with numbers were distributed at the box office before the film. Those with the winning number would get a prize. It would be the same race every week except for the tacked on last shot in which the number of that weeks winner would be announced, which, I feel now, probably coincided with the number least in distribution. The girl with the final embrace seems more determined by whom the talents agencies thought was the better bet to become a money-spinning super-star. It was, as they say in the wrestling industry, a worked result.Yeah, it's worse than soap opera if you think about it. It's just whose going with whom to the total exclusion of the outside world. At least soaps have some stupid plots weaving in and out of the who is with whom. Nothing anyone does, thinks or says has anything to do with engaging the big world at large. There is no context beyond the period setting, here 1957. Wonderful shinny collector's cars (too bad they sound wrong. A '57 T-Bird did not growl like a sports car. It was a big fat V-8 hooked up to a spongy automatic transmission.) Men's clothes are wrong, the hair is wrong, the buses are wrong, as is the whole demeanor of small town folks at the time. Guys, even a-holes, didn't say the f words quite so openly but its used here to emphasize the hurt one woman feels.Hugh Heffner was from a small town in Illinois and when he began Playboy he supplied the whole script for teen-age guys to use in order to get laid. It just wasn't a question of natural and irresistible attraction but men had to go through a whole pseudo- intellectual song and dance to get even some stink on their finger. The phrases contemporary mores and mature adults were used a lot. People act and talk like 1997, not 1957. Did I hear one brother call the other dude?As for what passes for conflict the poor, working class boys from the other side of the tracks live as well as M-G-M poverty in the good old days. Actually schoolteachers are considered middle class. They live in a swell house with perfect wood details and well- painted walls. The people who lived on the other side of the tracks were either colored or poor white trash. This concocted conflict has to be folded in to give the bland drama a little bit of spice. Even the environment is flattened out to be uniformly pleasant and unremarkable. Its always-fair weather, none of those sweaty 100-degree summers or winters with snow up to one's nipples. Anyway the retro-design element is shoved out of the way after the first half-hour and the somewhat baffling mating dance takes center stage and the five are whittled down to the inevitable two. And they live happily ever after and had two children, both girls. The End. What was the film about? Harry Cohn used to lay out this kind of plot in the most salacious terms. Yeah, it gets down to that. Permutations and stops and starts between various Holts and Abbotts. Relationships equal couplings equal voyeurism and we're back at cinema's ground zero &#150; watching other people do it. It's just that certain males get off watching porn and certain women get off on relationships.Then there's the music, typical for this type of picture - insipid. Synthetic noodelings on an electric piano for two scenes, deep swelling amorphous strings for transitions and actual movement. There's some not quite correct period music and a tribute to the Elvis hit of the era- Love Me Tender, but this is soon submerged under the overwhelming need of shuffling the brothers and sisters around. Like everything else in the picture &#150; nothing to distract you from the issue always at hand- whose getting with whom.I'm not saying there's not an audience for this. Some of the comments on the IMDb were from people emotionally effected by INVENTING THE ABBOTTS. There was just enough information to engage their imaginations, erotic or otherwise, the hell with the world or 1957 or anything else. I'm sure the manufacturers of this film knew exactly who their audience was and manipulated the film specifically for them. It's just that women's films don't have to be one-dimensional panderings. They can tell their stories against a real world with real people or at least set against a backdrop of some import. It's got to be about something more than just who's going with whom.

Now they are an exclusively female designed, designated, manufactured and sold product. The chick flick of today. There's got to be more than just endless variations on who's going with whom. The same giggly obsession of 8-year-old girls in the schoolyard matching up their schoolmates. It reminds me of an analogy with duplicate bridge where the same characters and elements can be played a different way each time and still lead to an arbitrary predetermined ending. Maybe there's a better analogy.When I was a kid the Saturday matinée had one feature left over from the 30s, which was a slapstick race. (The concept was later taken by Hanna &#150;Barbera and turned into Wacky Racers.) Tickets with numbers were distributed at the box office before the film. Those with the winning number would get a prize. It would be the same race every week except for the tacked on last shot in which the number of that weeks winner would be announced, which, I feel now, probably coincided with the number least in distribution. The girl with the final embrace seems more determined by whom the talents agencies thought was the better bet to become a money-spinning super-star. It was, as they say in the wrestling industry, a worked result.Yeah, it's worse than soap opera if you think about it. It's just whose going with whom to the total exclusion of the outside world. At least soaps have some stupid plots weaving in and out of the who is with whom. Nothing anyone does, thinks or says has anything to do with engaging the big world at large. There is no context beyond the period setting, here 1957. Wonderful shinny collector's cars (too bad they sound wrong. A '57 T-Bird did not growl like a sports car.

Watching the movie is a mental process of seeking what is human nature. Strong emotion aroused in me when I watch it for the first time in class.

Then this film goes on in black and white. Someone may wander why the director had to make it a black and white film. In my opinion the director made it on purpose. The gray pictures show audience a kind of depression and seriousness. At that period, the dark clouds of death covered the Jews' sky. The color of life has gone; the color of civilization has gone. To be frank, watching this three hours long film in black and white makes me feel uncomfortable, but is this feeling just like what the victims felt in those days? Being in the darkness for so long, they are really eager to see light---the light of hope, and they are longing for color---the color of life. The film let the audience experience this feeling in these black and white pictures. Based on the true story in World WarⅡ, this film tells us a story about a German business man, Oscar Schindler, tried to save more than one thousand Jews and other victims from the Nazi Germans. Oscar Schindler used to live a luxurious life with great ambitions in his business. He was a devoted member of the Nazi party and was in close touch with the Nazi officers. The war provided him a good opportunity for his business, thus he wanted to get every possible benefit from it and decided to manufacture military need products. Just because the Jews are the lest costly labors available, they were brought to work for him. At first when his Jewish workers were killed by the soldiers, he was just angry because it made him lose money. One day, with the words today is history, of Amen, the chief officer of the German troop, the holocaust began. The noise of machine guns was never stopped in that day. The blood of the Jews flooded the streets. Oscar Schindler, who was riding a horse in the wood, happened to saw the killing from the hill. In the mess, he saw a Jewish girl running in the street. In this black and white film, only the girl was in red. This color makes her different. I think the director must indicate something to us. What does this color mean? Does it represent blood and anger of killing, or passion and hope of life? I kindly thought it was hope, but in the later part of the film, we saw the girl in red again among the bodies to be burnt. When I watched the film for the second time, I realize that had not for some good people like Schindler, no one can survive under the beast like Nazi. After seeing the holocaust, Schindler changed. He tried his best to save the Jews. He bought over 1000 lives from the devil. Through the long list with the type machine clicking, we see the light of hope again. In the final of the film, the war ended, and the picture turned to color again. The world is bright again. This is a movie worthies watching for everyone. We should never forget history. Keeping history in mind does not mean keeping hatred in heart and revenging, while forgetting history means betrayal to all humankind.

Michael Keaton reprises his role as Batman and has a lot more to do in this film. He looks more comfortable in the role the second time around and is on par with the villains performances. Danny Devito is the perfect penguin. I really like the conversion of the penguin into the grotesque penguin man instead of the non threatening character from the comics or TV show because now the character has more depth and has a far more interesting story that generates from the basic need of family and to feel accepted and wanted. this gives us an evil character who we feel sympathy for because he was rejected for being what he is which is not his fault. Michelle Pfeiffer is excellent as Catwoman. she is sleet and sexy and she is also a villain we can feel sorry for because of the way she is victimised.

Boyd's bosses aren't happy, the secret service aren't happy & the Vice President isn't happy so as punishment Boyd is sent to work in Precinct 15, the biggest s-hole in Detroit & undergo anger therapy. Boyd is partnered up with patrol cop George Clark (Isaiah Washington) who quickly stumble across a plot by a gang of corrupt cops to steal impounded heroin from the police lock up & sell it, unsure of who they can trust Boyd & Clark have to go it alone dodging bullets as they try to clean up Precinct 15...This American Australian co-production was directed by Andrzej Bartkowiak & one has to say that Exit Wounds is a pretty ordinary & routine action thriller about some one man army super cop bringing down some drug dealers. The script by Ed Horowitz & Richard D'Ovidio was based on the novel by John Westermann & feels like a mishmash of action film clichés cobbled together. There's the obligatory white cop black cop partnership which never actually goes anywhere, the lone maverick cop whose wife left him because of the job & has to go it alone to catch the bad guy's, the predictable plot twists, various fight & action scenes which have little relevance to the story, some awful comedy relief & a fairly routine Hollywood thriller plot about drugs. Nothing really gels that well in Exit Wounds, most of the events seem unconnected & somewhat random. To be fair to Exit Wounds though it passes 100 odd minutes harmlessly enough, it's certainly not the worst film out there & there's one or two memorably spectacular action set-pieces & there's a funny little nod towards the brutality of Seagal's earlier films in that his character is forced to go to anger management therapy in a fairly amusing scene which also pokes a little bit of fun at his weight & that he is getting fatter & fatter with each passing film he makes. Unfortunately to balance that amusing scene out the ending is truly dire with the two main comedy relief character's talking to each other & trying to be funny, a truly embarrassing scene. While there's nothing hugely wrong with Exit Wounds there's nothing that great about it either, basically it's fairly predictable Hollywood stuff saved by some impressive action scenes.Director Bartkowiak does a decent job, the film looks nice with bright cinematography, some nice angles especially during the opening shoot-out on the bridge, there's plenty of clean lines, fast sports cars, hip music & it has a bit of style about it. The action scenes save Exit Wounds, from a huge shoot-out on a bridge to exploding cars to gunfights to martial arts fights to motorbike chases to car chases to all sorts of explosions, property damage & brutality. It actually looks like Seagal put some effort into the fight scenes in Exit Wounds, in fact Exit Wounds is probably the best film Seagal has made during the twenty first century & the last of his big budget Hollywood flicks with Warner Bros. While filming in Hamilton during the scene when the van rolls upside & skids along the street with everyone inside jumping out a stuntman died after the stunt went wrong, this scene was re-shot later which probably cost a lot since it's one of the more expensive looking action scenes in the film. Apparently filming was also delayed when actor David Vadim was arrested & charged with sexual assault by police on the set!With a supposed budget of about $33,000,000 Exit Wounds did OK at the box-office taking about $20,000,000 during it's opening weekend. The film certainly has that big budget Hollywood polish about it & the production values are high & glossy. Set in Detroit but largely filmed in Canada. The acting is alright, Seagal is OK I suppose. When I first saw the credits & saw someone called DMX I thought isn't that a make of bike? But then I realised that's a BMX... Fine character actors such as Tom Arnold, Isaiah Washington, Bill Duke, Jill Henessey & Bruce McGill are all wasted in small roles but the films still definitely better for having them there.Exit Wounds is a pretty routine action thriller that takes most of the Hollywood stereotype's & clichés & churns out a reasonable flick with which to pass 100 odd minutes. Exit Wounds is nothing amazing but it's not too bad & the action scenes provide plenty of bang for your money, neither the best action film out there or the worst.

Upon leaving, they imitate the language in the film, prompting their parents to react in surprisingly shocking ways. They start the MAC(Mothers Against Canada) before getting president Clinton involved along with talk show host Conan O'Brian before arresting Terrence and Philip and putting all Canadian-American citizens into special Concentration camps. Canada decides to act upon this and thus a gory war on Canada is declared. The boys realize that it's up to them to fix things before Satan takes over the world as soon as Terrence and Philip are executed. The fact that this film is animated is what makes it funny and ironic. In a way, the film is making a comment on itself and it's source material. The fact that the film has something very relevant to say about first amendment rights is what makes it daring and worth seeing. I do not know of any other film that does this. The originality of the concept really helps it define it's ability to be watchable. I consider the show, SOUTH PARK, to be one of the most brilliant and funniest television shows to come around for a while. This film not only pushes the idea of the show in a direction that makes sense, but it also takes into consideration the feedback the show gets for it's language and subject matter. Everything about this film is pretty perverse. Anybody can figure that out by just the title, SOUTH PARK BIGGER, LONGER, AND UNCUT. When it was in theaters, a lot of people I knew who had no idea what the show was just assumed that it was a pornographic film. Indeed, there were times in the film in which the content was pushed a little too far. However, the show does this to me almost all of the time. What makes the show really special to me is that it actually bothers to challenge me and what I can handle in a way that works because it is animated. There are times when the show is really hilarious and over-the-top, and there are times when it actually challenges the viewer to laugh. There are times on the show in which there are genuinely emotional moments and times where there is heartless cruelty. This film is no different. The character of Eric Cartman has to deal with a V-chip that is surgically implanted into his head that caused him to get shocked when he swears. Stan is in love with a girl in his class who he can't have. Kyle's mother is the woman who starts the coalition against Canada and is forced to deal with the embarrassment of that and has to protect his adopted younger brother Ike as he is Canadian. These plights in this movie are treated with more sincerity and respect than they probably ever would in another movie. To help push things along and add even more emotion, there are also musical segments. The film is a musical and the songs in them are fantastic. This film has one of the better soundtracks of the last ten years. This film will always hold a special place in my heart. Nine years later, it is still amazing and funny as hell.

There are times when the show is really hilarious and over-the-top, and there are times when it actually challenges the viewer to laugh. There are times on the show in which there are genuinely emotional moments and times where there is heartless cruelty. This film is no different. The character of Eric Cartman has to deal with a V-chip that is surgically implanted into his head that caused him to get shocked when he swears. Stan is in love with a girl in his class who he can't have. Kyle's mother is the woman who starts the coalition against Canada and is forced to deal with the embarrassment of that and has to protect his adopted younger brother Ike as he is Canadian. These plights in this movie are treated with more sincerity and respect than they probably ever would in another movie. To help push things along and add even more emotion, there are also musical segments. The film is a musical and the songs in them are fantastic. This film has one of the better soundtracks of the last ten years. This film will always hold a special place in my heart. Nine years later, it is still amazing and funny as hell. Definitely check this one out if you haven't yet.

The United States have three of those huge ships above three of their most important cities.

What this movie does is trying to explain why Humbert Humbert likes them younger, while I believe in the Kubrick movie he isn't interested in Lolita at all in the beginning and actually tries to fight it but finally falls for her fatal seductions. In this movie they both want each other from basically the moment they see each other.It perhaps also makes this version more sensual, although it's not very hard to be more sensual than a movie that got made back in the early '60's. This version is also more sensual due to both Jeremy Irons and Dominique Swain. There is nothing wrong with James Mason and Sue Lyon but Jeremy Irons and Dominique Swain have a better natural chemistry together. And while Frank Langella ain't no Peter Sellers, he does a good job in his role, even though his role is rather restrained in the movie, which is a sort of a waste of such a fine character and actor such as Frank Langella.It simply is its fine and also controversial story that makes this movie such a great one.

Each has produced an uneven body of work. Halloween, for instance, despite its forced sequels, was a truly heart-pounding thriller. The Thing was a gross-out bomb. Christine stands, in my opinion, as King's most enduring work. By contrast, Pet Semetary was also a gross-out bomb. John Carpenter's movie version of Christine is somewhere in the middle between success and failure. It is successful because, even if one hasn't read the book, a viewer will stick with it simply to find out how everything turns out. It is a failure because it tries to use shorthand to fill in for the material that made King's novel worthwhile. In interviews with this DVD both Carpenter and writer Bill Phillips proclaim that they decided to eliminate the Roland D. LeBay back story in favor of making the car the centerpiece. They try to fill in by introducing LeBay's brother, George, as a sort of surrogate, right down to Roland's filthy back brace. Readers will connect the brace with the Roland character in the novel, but in the film it merely distracts from the rest of the scene. They also try to fill in by crafting a completely original opening assembly line sequence that supposedly introduces the evil that is present in the car that would one day be called Christine. This one decision loses the impact of the novel, whose point is that the evil which possessed the car came from Roland LeBay's own poisoned soul--and that evil persisted after his death. By placing the evil in an inanimate object (and then attempting to persuade us that car is somehow alive) Carpenter and Phillips cause us to cease to care. Each of us has dealt with inanimate objects which appear to have a will of their own, but Christine is stretches us beyond the limit. The deleted scenes included with the 2003 release show evidence that, in limited ways, Carpenter and Phillips understood this. For instance, in one hospital scene, Dennis has Arnie sign his cast. In a deleted scene, occurring a bit later, Dennis asks for another signature. The point, of course, is that the two are completely different. Arnie is possessed by the evil soul of Roland LeBay. The minutes devoted to the opening sequence should have been used to flesh out this back story.Readers of the novel know that King set the story in a working-class suburb of Pittsburgh. The complexity of that setting is itself a kind of character. Within minutes, we discover that the movie is set in California, a part of America that most Pittsburghers would perceive as particularly shallow. Carpenter undoubtedly did this to avoid extensive winter sequences, including one particularly brutal blizzard. It's but another short cut that trivializes the story. King's novel is a highly effective meditation on the persistence of evil. The movie inspires no terror and no dread. It isn't even particularly humorous. Instead, we stay with it just to see how it comes out. The great strength of King's novel is that it was about people and only marginally about the car. In casting unknowns, and then buying 24 1958 Plymouths, Carpenter asked us to focus on the car. It doesn't work. Here is my proposal Let's ask Frank Darabont to take a run at a remake. He did a wonderful job with the King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption (shortened to The Shawshank Redemption for the film) and the serial novel The Green Mile. Those films work because Darabont took King's work seriously in terms of time and place, and because he took the time to develop the characters. A remake of Christine at Darabont's hands, at about the same length as Shawshank or Green Mile, would be worth seeing.

It is successful because, even if one hasn't read the book, a viewer will stick with it simply to find out how everything turns out. It is a failure because it tries to use shorthand to fill in for the material that made King's novel worthwhile. In interviews with this DVD both Carpenter and writer Bill Phillips proclaim that they decided to eliminate the Roland D. LeBay back story in favor of making the car the centerpiece. They try to fill in by introducing LeBay's brother, George, as a sort of surrogate, right down to Roland's filthy back brace. Readers will connect the brace with the Roland character in the novel, but in the film it merely distracts from the rest of the scene. They also try to fill in by crafting a completely original opening assembly line sequence that supposedly introduces the evil that is present in the car that would one day be called Christine. This one decision loses the impact of the novel, whose point is that the evil which possessed the car came from Roland LeBay's own poisoned soul--and that evil persisted after his death. By placing the evil in an inanimate object (and then attempting to persuade us that car is somehow alive) Carpenter and Phillips cause us to cease to care. Each of us has dealt with inanimate objects which appear to have a will of their own, but Christine is stretches us beyond the limit. The deleted scenes included with the 2003 release show evidence that, in limited ways, Carpenter and Phillips understood this. For instance, in one hospital scene, Dennis has Arnie sign his cast. In a deleted scene, occurring a bit later, Dennis asks for another signature. The point, of course, is that the two are completely different. Arnie is possessed by the evil soul of Roland LeBay. The minutes devoted to the opening sequence should have been used to flesh out this back story.Readers of the novel know that King set the story in a working-class suburb of Pittsburgh. The complexity of that setting is itself a kind of character. Within minutes, we discover that the movie is set in California, a part of America that most Pittsburghers would perceive as particularly shallow. Carpenter undoubtedly did this to avoid extensive winter sequences, including one particularly brutal blizzard. It's but another short cut that trivializes the story. King's novel is a highly effective meditation on the persistence of evil. The movie inspires no terror and no dread. It isn't even particularly humorous. Instead, we stay with it just to see how it comes out. The great strength of King's novel is that it was about people and only marginally about the car. In casting unknowns, and then buying 24 1958 Plymouths, Carpenter asked us to focus on the car. It doesn't work. Here is my proposal Let's ask Frank Darabont to take a run at a remake. He did a wonderful job with the King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption (shortened to The Shawshank Redemption for the film) and the serial novel The Green Mile. Those films work because Darabont took King's work seriously in terms of time and place, and because he took the time to develop the characters. A remake of Christine at Darabont's hands, at about the same length as Shawshank or Green Mile, would be worth seeing.

Those three words fit Roy Andersson's Songs from the Second Floor to a 't.' The film was a success at the 2000 Cannes film festival, winning the Jury Prize and gaining critical accolades internationally. The film is entirely unique, and magical creation of Andersson's mind. The film follows a number of individuals,some of whom are loosely tied together through personal connections, all of whom share in the existential dread and tragedy of life. We have a magician who nearly saws in half a volunteer, a fired employee, a businessman specializing in crucifixes, and another man who has lost his business to a fire (a fire which he admits he started), his family (including a son who has gone mad from writing poetry), and a series of other characters, not least of which a large congregation of businessmen who walk the streets amid a never ending traffic jam whipping themselves with chains. The story flows through vignettes, all captured in long shots by a camera that only moves once throughout the film. The city appears abandoned - save for the traffic jam and roaming flagellants. It's gray and dingy, as abstract a city as could ever be imagined. The people who inhabit it are drab and deathly pale - that the film opens with a man in a tanning bed becomes utterly hilarious in its irony as the film progresses. There are so many scenes of extraordinary surrealist absurdity that if one was to talk about them all they would need many more pages than available here. Let's consider a few of the most memorable though. In one scene, a woman uses a telephone to explain to someone on the other end that she is stuck in traffic, and cannot get out. She is in a bar; outside we see the line of traffic, moving only as slowly as conceivable without standing still. Everything appears gray, totally abstract as from some world where colours have never been invented. The atmosphere is surreal, and I realize as I describe it I do it no justice at all. Another brilliant scene involves what appears to be the cities entire population as they gather - businessmen and clergymen alike - to carry out the ritual sacrifice of a young girl, meant to stimulate the stagnating economy. Another excellent scene involves the man who has burned down his store, trying to explain to investigators what he's lost, only to be distracted by the passing hoard of businessmen whipping themselves. For me however the most amazing scene comes last. In a very long take, we see the crucifix man discard a truckload of his inventory in front of the arsonist. He leaves, and the arsonist takes out his large crucifix and sets it down. We realize that 4 or so individuals have been slowly walking down the road in the background throughout the scene. They've been following the arsonist earlier in the film asking for help. This time he throws a can at them to scare them off. To his and our surprise,dozens of other people seem to pop up out of nowhere from the ground in the surrounding field. What a shot; it's one of the best I've ever seen, and the camera never moves once throughout its duration. But I digress. What does it all mean? A quick search of movie message boards will lead you to a number of queries; the DVD also apparently has a commentary track by Andersson himself discussing and deconstructing the symbolism in the film (I have not seen this yet, and as of now am still unsure if I really want to). The film, I think, a scathing satire of modern society and capitalist realism. It's also about the dangers of mixing superstition and reality. Consider the flagellating businessmen, self-inflicting pain to stimulate the economy. The sacrifice of the young girl for the same purpose; this also simultaneously highlights how corporations expect us to march towards our deaths each day (ie cigarettes and alcohol, and so on). The man who burns down his business is shown to be greedy throughout, happy he doesn't have to repay a friend when he commits suicide; yelling at his institutionalized son for not understanding that the purpose of life is to buy something and sell it with one or two extra zeroes. Andersson has been called the slapstick Bergman, and surely is one of the most interesting products of Sweden. He had pulled a Malick like move prior to Songs from the Second Floor, not making a feature film for 20 some years (although he was active in directing shorts, docs, and commercials). His return was a glorious one though, and one that was entirely original, and entirely inspiring. This is a dark and tragic film, but one that is also funny in that darkest of dark, and absurdest of absurd ways.

How the French must have resented its being made in English! (But why did the French themselves never film this story, which is so fundamental to the mythology of their literature?) There is no use viewers and reviewers complaining that the characters are disgusting everybody knows they were, and they would have been the first to admit it. This film has not been made for the wrong reasons, with fictional characters, but is a true story. It is rather disturbing to realize that absinthe has been legalised again and people are drinking it once more, when we see how it drove these two poets insane, which is what is really does, you know! The banning of absinthe should never have been lifted. It may be a pretty green colour, but it is not romantic or at all glamorous. One strange omission from this film is any of the poetry of either poet! Very few decent translations of Verlaine into English exist, because he used rhyme so much. But he was a great and soaring poet, and of course Rimbaud shattered all the moulds and basically founded modern poetry, and had the status of a god to the Surrealists. So it would have been good to hear some of their work, especially as it is all out of copyright and no one could have objected. The lack of the poetry stops people who do not already know it from appreciating the point of all this carrying-on. Verlaine and Rimbaud were appalling, violent, disorderly, and to call them extreme Bohemians doesn't go far enough they were both quite mad as well. But then, many poets are, and often the finest poetry comes from the ones who are the craziest (David Gascoyne, whom I knew well, is an example, and Ezra Pound whom I knew less well was not what you could call well-balanced). It is often said that there is a fine line between genius and madness, but with poets, the situation is even more dire to be a divinely inspired poet it seems that it is almost a requirement that you first lose your mind. (Exceptions are those with no fire in their temperament at all Eliot, Perse, Valery, or those who have become spiritual beings while still on earth, such as Rilke.) Well, the performances and direction are excellent here. Agnieszka Holland is an inspired director, a protégé of Wajda, and perhaps her greatest achievement was 'Washington Square' (1997). She is interested in art, not commerce, and congratulations to her for that! The young Leonardo Di Caprio, aged 20, was a scintillating, wild, and wholly convincing Rimbaud. You could believe every scene. David Thewlis was equally convincing as Verlaine, despite being rather too thin for the part (Verlaine was stockier and plumper, and Thewlis looks like he hasn't had a decent meal for ten years). Romane Bohringer was an excellent choice for Verlaine's wife, and plays it just right. The next year she would make her staggering pair of films, 'L'Appartement' and 'Portraits Chinois', in both of which she sets the cinema on fire. So the talent is there, and the film is delivered. If we find these people disturbing, it is because they were. But without this bizarre tale, twentieth century poetry would not have come into existence, because it was created by Arthur Rimbaud, and without Verlaine taking him under his wing it would never have happened. Christopher Hampton's screenplay is intelligent and thoughtful and well-crafted throughout. But then, that is what he does. It is good to have this on the screen, but for those who do not already know the story, it must be a real shocker. It is also not a film for 'homophobes', and if you don't want to see Leonard Di Caprio kissing a man on the mouth, look away now.
