[{"date":"1 August 2015","score":"","review":" Technically very rich. It takes us in the moment of reality and computer program. The Matrix slams you back in your chair, pops open your eyes and leaves your jaw hanging slack in amazement.The Matrix is a visually treat for all the cyberadventure, full of kinetic excitement, but it retreats to formula just when it's getting interesting. It is a Classic Sci-Fi and a step above the average movie. The Matrix is one of the few films that you'll find in almost anyones movie library. This is no surprise however, because the Matrix is a step above many sci-fi movies like it. The plot does not falter at any point during the film and the acting is superb. The shootouts are exhilarating and the special effects were ground-breaking. I'd recommend the Matrix to everyone. Action fans will be satisfied by the violence and people looking for something more than just action will also be pleased by the ideas and questions that the Matrix raises.

I was intrigued as to how Newman, whose career was defined by roguish but unmistakably likable characters, would drop all of his charm and step into the boots of an unashamedly villainous figure. I was also interested in seeing how Tom Hanks, known for his everyman appeal, would steer his acting in an opposite direction to his performances in 'Forrest Gump', 'Cast Away', 'Big' etc. I am glad to say that neither of these actors' performances disappointed me, and some of the other cast members (incl. Jude Law and a pre-007 Daniel Craig) similarly satisfied. Sam Mendes' crime thriller begins in a rather moody, atmospheric manner, and the getting to know the characters at a social gathering reminded me greatly of 'The Godfather'. If the film had maintained this throughout, I may have been inclined to award it an 8 or 9\/10. It disappointed me to see how 'Road to Perdition' was steered in a comic-book manner. Of course, directors work with what they get Francis Ford Coppola's masterful handling of 'The Godfather' was due in no small part to Mario Puzo's classic novel; therefore, I wasn't exactly surprised to see that John Rooney (Newman) and Michael Sullivan (Hanks) weren't given the staggering portraits awarded to Vito and Michael Corleone. Nevertheless, I was hoping for more. 'Road to Perdition' is posited somewhere between Quentin Tarantino and Scorsese\/Coppola, and I really hoped that Mendes would push it towards the latter. Unfortunately he didn't. As a result, I found it very hard to sympathise for any of the characters, and they never truly become known to the viewer. This tragic lack of emotion means that we follow the story, but don't invest in it. Despite the misguided direction of the film, it is certainly not an unenjoyable title. One element which is regularly praised in 'Road to Perdition' is its cinematography, and I can understand why. I haven't encountered such skillful camera-work since I saw 'Bullitt', and the use of reflective shots is just one element that defines Conrad L. Hall's perfect cinematography. The title is also very stylish, and the set designs are something to behold. Therefore, I'd summarise by saying that Sam Mendes' film is a very polished and technically superb title, but sadly swings towards 'Kill Bill' and similar titles, when its ideal place is amidst 'Goodfellas' and 'The Godfather'.
