Well, at least two-thirds of it is. Most love the first two, and granted, they are works of art. But it's the third one that has many split. I have read that some people have tried to forget about it all together. I will admit that it has its fair share of flaws. But I definitely won't forget about it.The Godfather Part III takes place some time after its predecessor. Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) is still stuck in the life that he never wanted. But now, the past has sort of caught up with him. He's tired of the business, and it's time for a change. Change appears in the form of Vincent (Andy Garcia), Michael's nephew (the bastard son of his brother, Sonny). Vincent is a confident and angry young man, and he seems perfect for the job. But problems arise when Vincent begins dating Michael's daughter, Mary (Sofia Coppola). Yes, kissing cousins.There is a side-story involving the pope or something, and I don't quite understand the story there. But there is another side-story involving Michael's son Anthony not wanting to take over the family business. Instead, Anthony wants to be an Opera singer, which sort of ties in with the climax of the film. Diane Keaton is wonderful as Michael's ex-wife Kay, and Talia Shire finally gets to do something as Michael's sister Connie.It is nice to see some of these characters again, but yet, something doesn't quite feel the same with The Godfather Part III. Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) is m.i.a. (he is actually dead in the movie, but the character's replacement doesn't get to do anything). The acting isn't quite the same either. With the exception of Keaton and Garcia (who was nominated for an Oscar), nobody seems to be doing their best. Everyone (besides Coppola, will get to that in a second) is good, but they are not up to the standards that they once reached.My favorite scenes are the ones between Michael and Kay. I think that those are really nice, especially since Michael is trying to turn over a new leaf in this one. Also, there wasn't really a second where I was bored throughout. Also, it does tie the series together nicely. Yes, of course it's too long. It's as if it was FFC's goal for the whole trilogy to make each of them long. He nailed it.Now, to the real flaws. Again, I don't quite understand the plot with the pope and stuff. But what really makes The Godfather Part III suffer is Sofia Coppola. Now, I'm sure that by now, this is probably what stirred up the most buzz about this movie, and you've probably heard about it anyway. Francis Ford Coppola directed a film called Tucker A Man and His Dream. It was a box office flop, and so he was told that he had to make a commercial hit to make his production company, American Zoetrope. So, he was forced to make a movie he never dreamed of The Godfather Part III.Winona Ryder was initially cast in the role of Mary Corleone, but was forced to drop out at the last second. He was sort of running out of time, so he had confidence that his daughter could do the role. Well, she did the role, and it won her two Razzies. Now, here's what's wrong with casting her For one thing, she isn't an actress. The only movies that were on her resume prior to TG3 was FFC's movies, and they were cameos. But what doesn't help about her lack of experience though is the fact that the character is just annoying. Mary is sort of slutty, naive, and, well, she's supposed to be smart but actually she just comes across as dumb and sort of desperate.Another thing that bothers me about The Godfather Part III is the fact that Mary and her cousin are dating, and nobody really seems to care. I was expecting Michael to freak out and sort of try and murder Vincent, and it doesn't happen. Instead, he calmly tells Vincent to end it. It just shouldn't have gone down like that. I know that if I was Mary's father I would slap her like Cher did in Moonstruck and tell her to snap out of it.In the end, The Godfather Part III was nominated for 7 Oscars, including Best Picture, Director, and supporting actor. So, who had the last laugh, TG3 haters? But, that said, it did go home empty handed, and it was the only one in the series not to win Best Picture. Also, despite all of the negative publicity, Sofia Coppola eventually won an Oscar for writing 2003's Lost in Translation. Who really had the last laugh? She sure couldn't act, but at least she found her niche.The Godfather Part III may have been better had Coppola spent more time on it. But I am still happy for what it is. I still think, all flaws aside, that it really is a good movie. With more time, he may have reached potential. Instead, we have a flawed, but very good, movie with great moments.

Many have debated which film from this era was the best. A lot of people say that it's The Lion King (1994), and others say that it's Aladdin (1992). But in my opinion, the best animated feature from this era was the Disney Studio's 30th full-length animated feature, Beauty and the Beast (1991). This was the first Disney animated feature to be nominated for an Oscar for Best Picture and that honor is well deserved. It's the best Disney animated fairy tale the studio has produced and it's also a superb movie musical. Most of us know the story to this one. A young, spoiled prince is transformed into a beast by an enchantress after his selfish behavior towards her in a beggar disguise. This spell on the prince also affects his servants as they are transformed into household objects (candlesticks, clocks, teapots, etc.). He is to remain a beast for the rest of his life unless he earns the love of another person in exchange for their love before his 21st birthday. We are then introduced to Belle, a beautiful young woman who loves to read books and dreams of a better life than the one she is currently living. She is tired of a repetitive life in the village she lives in. Although a town hero named Gaston has interest in marrying her, Belle could care less. Her father heads out of town, but gets lost along the way and stumbles upon the Beast's castle. When the Beast takes him prisoner for trespassing and Belle discovers the Beast's castle searching for her father, Belle volunteers to take his place and save her father's life. At first, neither of these two have any interest in getting to know each other. But as time passes and certain events take place, these two eventually start to open up and develop feelings to one another. Beauty and the Beast has some of the most breathtaking animation and visuals the Disney Studios have ever put out. It's the type of drawing that simply needs to be seen in able for one to truly appreciate the craft behind it. Some well-drawn scenes include the introduction with the stained glass windows, the Belle and Be Our Guest numbers, and the ballroom scene. If you want more proof why I believe 2D animation is superior to 3D animation, then look at what this film has to offer since it is a visual marvel. Beauty and the Beast has perfectly crafted music and songs by the colossal teaming of Alan Menken and the late Howard Ashman. Every song is a classic from the excellent opening musical number Belle to the hilarious villain song Gaston to the timeless musical number Be Our Guest to the immortal title tune. There's a reason why this is the only Disney animated feature on the AFI's list of the 25 Greatest Musicals. All of the songs contribute to the story. They all have memorable melodies and rhythms, and they all enhance the enjoyment of the picture more. Then there's the film's high quality storytelling and tremendous characters. Belle easily ranks as the finest Disney female leading character in that she wants something more out of life than a prince, which is more than can be said for all of the other Disney princesses. With his physical attractiveness serving as an ironic contrast to the Beast's deceiving outer looks and his willingness to do whatever it takes to force Belle to marry him, Gaston makes for an excellent even underrated Disney villain. I must also compliment the storytellers on a job well done with making the Beast a complex creature that is stuck in between being either a hero or a semi-villain. You can tell that he's stuck between doing the right thing and doing something that will only please himself in the film's first half. Between the way he was designed by the animators and the way the Beast conveys his internal struggles from this spell, everything about this character was handled impeccably. The other side characters are well done. I personally enjoyed Lumiere, the candlestick, the best. I loved his elegant charm which is shown in full display when he's singing in the Be Our Guest musical number. I also liked his simple mindedness when it comes to how long it takes for someone to develop a romantic relationship. Cogsworth is another great side character between his loyalty to the Beast and how he sometimes needs to act as his conscience. Also, the film's central message about looking past the outer looks of certain people or creatures and into their soul is a virtuous message to get across to kids. Sometimes, what we all seek for in life is in the last place we'd look at and what Belle eventually discovers in the Beast is no exception. Beauty and the Beast is easily one of the studio's finest films. The animation is stunning, the music is sensational, the characters are excellent, and the story is well told and well-paced. It's one of the rare Disney films that adults might enjoy even more than their kids. See this film if you haven't already.

We are then introduced to Belle, a beautiful young woman who loves to read books and dreams of a better life than the one she is currently living. She is tired of a repetitive life in the village she lives in. Although a town hero named Gaston has interest in marrying her, Belle could care less. Her father heads out of town, but gets lost along the way and stumbles upon the Beast's castle. When the Beast takes him prisoner for trespassing and Belle discovers the Beast's castle searching for her father, Belle volunteers to take his place and save her father's life. At first, neither of these two have any interest in getting to know each other. But as time passes and certain events take place, these two eventually start to open up and develop feelings to one another. Beauty and the Beast has some of the most breathtaking animation and visuals the Disney Studios have ever put out. It's the type of drawing that simply needs to be seen in able for one to truly appreciate the craft behind it. Some well-drawn scenes include the introduction with the stained glass windows, the Belle and Be Our Guest numbers, and the ballroom scene. If you want more proof why I believe 2D animation is superior to 3D animation, then look at what this film has to offer since it is a visual marvel. Beauty and the Beast has perfectly crafted music and songs by the colossal teaming of Alan Menken and the late Howard Ashman. Every song is a classic from the excellent opening musical number Belle to the hilarious villain song Gaston to the timeless musical number Be Our Guest to the immortal title tune. There's a reason why this is the only Disney animated feature on the AFI's list of the 25 Greatest Musicals. All of the songs contribute to the story. They all have memorable melodies and rhythms, and they all enhance the enjoyment of the picture more. Then there's the film's high quality storytelling and tremendous characters. Belle easily ranks as the finest Disney female leading character in that she wants something more out of life than a prince, which is more than can be said for all of the other Disney princesses. With his physical attractiveness serving as an ironic contrast to the Beast's deceiving outer looks and his willingness to do whatever it takes to force Belle to marry him, Gaston makes for an excellent even underrated Disney villain. I must also compliment the storytellers on a job well done with making the Beast a complex creature that is stuck in between being either a hero or a semi-villain. You can tell that he's stuck between doing the right thing and doing something that will only please himself in the film's first half. Between the way he was designed by the animators and the way the Beast conveys his internal struggles from this spell, everything about this character was handled impeccably. The other side characters are well done. I personally enjoyed Lumiere, the candlestick, the best. I loved his elegant charm which is shown in full display when he's singing in the Be Our Guest musical number. I also liked his simple mindedness when it comes to how long it takes for someone to develop a romantic relationship. Cogsworth is another great side character between his loyalty to the Beast and how he sometimes needs to act as his conscience. Also, the film's central message about looking past the outer looks of certain people or creatures and into their soul is a virtuous message to get across to kids. Sometimes, what we all seek for in life is in the last place we'd look at and what Belle eventually discovers in the Beast is no exception. Beauty and the Beast is easily one of the studio's finest films. The animation is stunning, the music is sensational, the characters are excellent, and the story is well told and well-paced.

Many have debated which film from this era was the best. A lot of people say that it's The Lion King (1994), and others say that it's Aladdin (1992). But in my opinion, the best animated feature from this era was the Disney Studio's 30th full-length animated feature, Beauty and the Beast (1991). This was the first Disney animated feature to be nominated for an Oscar for Best Picture and that honor is well deserved. It's the best Disney animated fairy tale the studio has produced and it's also a superb movie musical. Most of us know the story to this one. A young, spoiled prince is transformed into a beast by an enchantress after his selfish behavior towards her in a beggar disguise. This spell on the prince also affects his servants as they are transformed into household objects (candlesticks, clocks, teapots, etc.). He is to remain a beast for the rest of his life unless he earns the love of another person in exchange for their love before his 21st birthday.

It is a thing no one wanted to watch, and some people had to because they are film critics, or market test groups, or Academy voters. It is one of those repugnant synopses that says, You have better ways to spend 2 precious hours of your life. This is madness. So, what got me to watch it on demand last night? I'll tell you what.I looked up from my laptop, from my shopping and banking and usual Saturday afternoon activities, whilst the tele was on in the living room. I looked up and saw Elizabeth Shue, a familiar face associated with good storytelling. The scene was unfamiliar--a movie I haven't seen?--I watched for a minute. Then the camera moved to Nicholas Cage and the look in his eyes chilled me to the bone. My soul searched for signs of a soul and found none. Nothing. Vacant. Utterly without life. Utterly believable. Gripping. A moment, a five-second shot maybe, a 10-second fixation (who's counting?), that is one of those moments in film history--that moment when you cannot take your eyes away, when you are mesmerized and horrified, filled with dread and pity. Wow. What is this? Hit guide--oh, it's that one--the one about the guy who wants to drink himself to death. Hm. But that moment, my god, wow-- Nicholas Cage, that was stunning. I went to a party that night and it was the first thing I had to talk about--have you seen this film--that moment? It made me want to watch the movie!

The screenplay is the picture. It's an ideal screenplay that is unexpected to be so enthralling and clever. The film celebrates Shakespeare's life, explores his greatest writing achievements, most obviously being Romeo & Juliet, but other iconic pieces get a few homages. Fiction life imitates art so wonderfully, you could fool a naive man with a claim this was a fact-by-fact biography. Any theater\/English influenced person could easily wish this story the way it all actually happened. It uses real-life fact to build the fiction, and it's still a hilarious, romantic movie to watch.Mirroring Romeo & Juliet for most of the film, Shakespeare in Love gets to explore ironies of social issues at the time and the truth and nature of love. This film sets an example to non- artists, an artist's inspiration for their work. One of the easiest routes for producing wonderful writing, music, or paintings is love. Shakespeare in Love is one of the few romantic films that actually is completely successful in capturing love. Some say, you must go back to Shakespeare's original works to acquire great acting or truth in theater or entertainment, and Shakespeare in Love does successfully allow the lead couple act out Romeo & Juliet, but it also sets a precedent that all you need is good writing making romance and narrative just as tantalizing as the classics. A good deal of fun can be had by the audience watching Shakespeare in Love, it's also contains moments of hilarious comedy. But Shakespeare, Romeo & Juliet, and this movie prove Judi Dench's character, Queen Elizabeth, wrong on love, who claim that true love can never be captured in the theater.Joseph Fiennes and Gwyneth Paltrow dazzle in the depth of their strong characters and passionate romance. Paltrow has such powerful charm and lovability behind Viola and Fiennes creates a great depiction of the most popular scribe in history. Judi Dench's cameo is a wonderful addition. The costumes are a degree above other period piece's clothing design, enriched in creativity and elegance. The sets and cinematography are beautiful, the editing breaks down the wall of the viewer's imagination, and its underlined with a romantically epic musical score. The director, John Madden, makes all the risky components of a film with so many intricacies into a sweeping masterpiece, that's hard to sit through without smiling and even harder to leave with tears.

I almost walked out before the actual feature had even started.Everything from the premise to the acting to the dialogue is so bad it's good.It's still unclear if the film makers were intending to make something this ridiculous or if they lost be bet and were seriously attempting to make real movie and did everything wrong and just accidentally got it right.This is truly either a work of genius or utter stupidity. But it surprisingly works.The entire story takes place within only 48 hours. As the title states the plot revolves around an everyman widower scientist Dan Aykroyd whose bizarre experiments accidentally send a devastating death ray to a super intelligent aliens race in another galaxy.Kim Basinger quickly arrives as a femme fatal alien agent sent to reverse the ray. Hence most of the jokes revolve around Basinger's alieness such as drinking battery acid out of cars and reading books by touching them, as well as her super powers such sending people literally flying away, and of course her complete lack of understanding of human culture, mainly her lack of understanding sexual innuendos.It's as if 'My Favorite Martian' was a blonde bombshell.Basinger's sidekick, her sassy alien super powered handbag is actually a major star of the film as it provides many of the jokes.The speed of the plot itself set much of the slapstick tone. Aykroyd and Basinger marry within 12 hours! It's because the plot cannot be taken seriously that so many of the gags work. A few examples When as security guard asks Basinger for some ID, her bag prints out a gun belt of 30 IDs each with the same photo of her present hair and clothing.When she goes grocery shopping at 300am she attempts to pay with a softball sized diamond, then a $5,000 bill. When the cashier asks her for something smaller she predictably produces a smaller $5,000 bill.When she asks her bag to describe sex, well you can pretty much guess what it punches out.When Aykroyd's boss catches her snooping around his lab she sends him literally flying all the way back to his car. He's in such shock he say, Yes, yes, on my way home. Must get home. As I said, these gags shouldn't logically work but they do.A few of the father daughter scenes are downright creepy. Even creepier than the scenes in 'Poltergeist' when the parents smoke pot around their kids and Craig T. Nelson later reveals his wife is 32 and their daughter is 16.Aykroyd brags to his daughter, a young Willow from 'Buffy The Vampire Slayer' about his scoring with Basinger, more than one to which she is happy for him. Creepy! This film also enjoys some cult status due to its early performances by very young Juliet Lewis and Seth Green.As it was said about 'The Naked Gun,' no one over the age of seven can possibly enjoy it.

Now, I have never exactly found Glenn Close sexy, but it is obvious just why she was chosen. It's because she's amazing in this movie. She is mysterious, she is bonkers, and you really can't take your eyes off of her. I loved Cher's performance in Moonstruck, but I still have to say that the Oscar should have gone to Close.Fatal Attraction isn't a great movie. I think that whoever wrote it (and, basically, any other movie where an obsessive woman goes insane) is slightly sexist. But it doesn't matter. Fatal Attraction is extremely entertaining. It is definitely a wild ride, and it may not have worked without Close. She beat out plenty of incredibly sexy actresses for the role. Just watch it, and you'll see why.A- ","genre":"Drama, Thriller"},{"date":"24 June 2013","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Francis Ford Coppola won three Oscars for his work on the 1974 film The Godfather Part II, the rare sequel that outdoes the original. The original was a masterpiece, and everyone knew it. And I must say that it is pretty difficult to outdo a masterpiece. But Coppola and his screenwriter Mario Puzo really knock it out of the park the second time.The Godfather Part II tells two stories this time One is of Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) who now has a family with his wife Kay (Diane Keaton), but really nobody, including his sister Connie (Talia Shire) loves him because he has let the power go to his head. After an assassination attempt, Michael goes on the hunt for the bastard who tried to kill him. The second story is the back story of Vito Corleone (Robert De Niro), whose family was murdered when he was a boy, and basically he too is seeking vengeance.What I love about The Godfather Part II, besides the fact that it tells two stories, is that it covers the ground that the original film did, but this one digs deeper. The first film mainly focused on family and betrayal. This one focuses on betrayal in the family, which makes for a much juicier and shocking story. The Godfather Part II is a stunner, mainly because you never know where it's going to go, or how it's going to get there.The sequel is more interesting than its predecessor. This one feels a little more like a thriller. Pacino gives one of his best performances here. Here he plays such a complex character. You know that he never wanted any of this, and it is terrible just to see how far he will take it. What started off as a nice man slowly turns into a monster, and that is sort of what keeps the film afloat.The Godfather trilogy is a special one, and this one is the main reason why. This film is a masterpiece, and it is no wonder that it became the first sequel ever to win best picture. It is a difficult decision, because I really do love the first one. But this is a much more interesting and fascinating film than the original. Either way, they are both very amazing movies. I don't know when Francis Ford Coppola will make another movie.

It was on for just over 3 hours... but it really did feel like it was longer.The movie is about the assassination of the former president John F. Kennedy. What I really liked about this film was the fact that they used real footage of JFK. There were no actors playing him, it was actually him. He got shot right at the beginning of the movie, and then the rest of the movie was about District Attorney Jim Garrison, who believes that Lee Harvey Oswald was used as a patsy and Kennedy was shot by someone else. It then turns into a court drama.I did like it, and it was very interesting, but it just seemed to be a very slow going movie.There were some fantastic performances though. The cast list was amazing in this movie. Kevin Costner, Tommy Lee Jones, Gary Oldman, Joe Pesci, Kevin Bacon, Jack Lemmon, Sissy Spacek, Walter Matthau, Donald Sutherland, John Candy, Michael Rooker & Wayne Knight.The film was made by Oliver Stone. The man is a legend and knows how to make a great film.The make-up was not so good... Joe Pesci looked terrible. He was wearing a really bad wig and huge fake eyebrows. But later in the film, you see they are supposed to be bad. Tommy Lee Jones' wig though was hilarious. I couldn't help but laugh when I first saw him. I wasn't expecting John Candy to be in it... I was pleasantly surprised. He was a great actor and he made so many classic movies. He is still missed now.I didn't know much about the JFK assassination when I watched this.

Filled with great direction,an amazing cast,a wonderful screenplay,truly beautiful cinematography and an unforgettable score,Raising Arizona is The Coen Brothers at their best and greatest.Raising Arizona tells the story of H.I. McDunnough(Nicholas Cage),a criminal and repeat offender and police officer 'Ed' Edwina(Holly Hunter)who fall in love and after falling in love decide to get married and have kids. When H.I. and Ed can't conceive kids of their own,H.I and Ed kidnap a quintuplet,Nathan Arizona JR(T.J Kuhn JR) one of the children of local business man Nathan Arizona(Trey Wilson). When H.I and Ed take Nathan J.r and want to raise him as their own wild and hilarious things happen in their lives.Raising Arizona is one of the all-time great classic Comedies from The Coen Brothers that came after their amazing film debut Blood Simple. When filmmakers have a first film that is so acclaimed and well loved, most filmmakers have to do a second film that lives up to the quality of their first film and not only does Raising Arizona live up to Blood Simple but also gives viewers a brilliant and much brighter and lighter cinematic experience. One of the reasons Raising Arizona is excellent and truly hilarious is because The Coen Brothers have given us a flawless film that combines great laughs with style and substance where everything in the film is over the top and exaggerated to the point of going over the top beyond belief. The laughs and humor in the film are funny,ingenious and original with hilarious Slapstick Comedy,funny dialog and moments in the movie that have you laughing until your stomach hurts and will have tears running down your face. The laughs are so crazy and over the top you will you're watching a surreal live Action Cartoon. What is also great about the Humor in this film and other Coen Brother films is that the laughs are subtle and used in visuals and imagery that are not obvious the first time you watch RA but when you watch the film with multiple viewings you will notice or catch some of the visual jokes of the film. And speaking of of visuals RA is one of the most beautiful and visually stunning Comedies I have ever seen. Barry Sonnefield's photography is amazing and powerful with wide angle shots,close ups and shots of the sunlight,road and dusty world of Arizona. Sonnefield's photography gives the film a surreal and wild energy that you don't see in most comedies and that is one of the great things that sets RZ apart from other films of it's type because RA can not only have a wonderful style but can also have amazing substance. The screenplay by Joel and Ethan Coen is hilarious and well and one of the best screenplays in Comedy history with the Coens giving the main great dialog that is funny,memorable and stylized as well as greatly using narration for H.I. McDunnough and lines from the main characters that are quotable and will stay in your mind. The two main characters H.I. and Ed McDunnough while over the top and are cartoon characters who are funny but are given great depth and humanity and you feel like the two truly love and care for one another and even though H.I and Ed kidnapped a baby they don't do it for fame or money,they do it because they want to be parents and want to love a child and the kidnapping make the main characters more complex than they truly are and that is one of many things that is great about RA and the Coens. Although not an Action film RA has a couple of good Action and chase scenes that are thrilling and exciting. Especially the film's main chase scene which is one of the funniest,wildest,original and over the top chase scenes in film history and it is a classic chase that that you will never forget. The ending of the film is funny,beautiful and very optimistic and will make you wonder what will happen to H.I and ED. An great ending to a great film.The whole cast does great jobs in their roles. Nicholas Cage is excellent,funny and at his best as H.I McDunnough,with Cage bringing laughs and depth to the role. Holly Hunter is brilliant as 'Ed' Edwina McDunnough,with Hunter feisty and funny and having great chemistry with Cage. Trey Wilson is wonderful and fun as Nathan Arizona,a local business man. John Goodman and William Forsythe are great,funny and over the top as Gale and Evelle Snoats,escaped convicts who are H.I's friends. Sam McMurray and Francis McDormand are amazing and hilarious as husband and wife Glen and Dot,friends of H.I. and Ed. Randell 'Tex' Cobb is fantastic as Leonard Smalls,a man hunter who's a man of few words and is looking for Nathan JR.The direction by Joel and Ethan Coen is excellent,with The Coens always moving the camera,using wide angles,low angles,close-ups and giving the film a great visual style. Great direction by The Coens.The score by Carter Burwell is is amazing,funny,beautiful and very quirky and matches the tone of the film,with Burwell greatly mixing whistles,yodeling,organs and banjos. Wonderful score by Burwell.In final word,if you love The Coen Brothers,Comedies or films in general,I highly suggest you check out Raising Arizona,a truly hilarious,funny and unforgettable Comedy and film classic that you can watch again and again.

Wonderful score by Burwell.In final word,if you love The Coen Brothers,Comedies or films in general,I highly suggest you check out Raising Arizona,a truly hilarious,funny and unforgettable Comedy and film classic that you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10\/10. ","genre":"Comedy, Crime, Drama"},{"date":"24 June 2013","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" I was pretty disappointed here. I had to watch this movie for a film class and I was not impressed in the slightest. I felt as if I were warped into a fake Al Capone universe. For the most part, I felt that the production team, in all, tried too hard. What I mean is that instead of following their gut and making what could have been an amazing movie, they doubted themselves and aimed for what they felt a focus group would contend to. I honestly feel that this movie would have been so much better if they had merely gone with the impulse. The cinematography is over dramatic, which is something you don't want to do too much in suspense films, it makes them seem fake and cheesy. I felt the action scenes were trying to be entertaining versus plot tools. I applaud Tim Roth, he was a convincing injured soldier, not too stereotypical. I know this would have been a good movie, but it just didn't quite turn out that way.

A guy who washed glasses in a nightclub until he is spotted by a porn movie director. Dirk then goes into the porn industry and his life gets turned upside down.It is a very entertaining story and very easy to follow. I would say this movie was a comedy. There were a lot of funny moments in it, as well as other serious moments, which gave it an element of drama.The cast list was amazing. I knew a few of these people were in it, but I didn't realise this many famous people were acting in it. The film starred Mark Wahlberg, the legendary Burt Reynolds, Julianne Moore, Heather Graham, John C. Reilly, Don Cheadle, William H. Macy & Phillip Seymour Hoffman.Everyone did an amazing job. It is not surprising that this film and the actors were nominated for so many awards, and even won a lot too.It felt like a bit or a roller coaster of a film. The emotions of the movie were all over the place. One minute I was laughing, then something would happen and it just shocked me. The drama kicked in... but then the comedy would come back.The film was set in the 70s and 80s... the clothes and hair was great. and the film also has a pretty good soundtrack.There was a lot of nudity in the film too. I don't know why I was surprised at this. After all, the film is about the porn industry... but for some reason I was shocked to see all these Hollywood actors and actresses flashing it all... and as for Mark Whalberg... he wishes his dong was that big! haha. Apparently, the fake willy that you saw at the end of the movie was given to Mark Wahlberg when filming was finished... he still owns it to this day... but it is not in the same condition anymore. haha.I will give this film 7 out of 10.I really liked it, and it really put me in a time machine and took me back to the 70s\/80s. )For more reviews, please like my Facebook pagehttps\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews\/456572047728204?ref=hl ","genre":null},{"date":"24 June 2013","score":"","review":" BOOGIE NIGHTSThis was a funny movie.The story is about the rise and fall of Dirk Diggler.
