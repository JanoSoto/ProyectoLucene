Im sure theyll be occupied for at least 3.5 hours. If you're grown up and on a date with a nice girl\/boy and want to impress them avoid this movie.Lord of the rings goes on where Star Wars ended; an endless battle between Good and Evil. A little guy called Frodo is trusted with the safekeeping of a golden ring, because the much bigger and powerful ancient demon fighting sorcerer Gandalf doesn't dare to. Yea right. First sign we are in for 3.5 hours of nonsense. The whole movie you never understand exactly why Frodo was picked. All he does is squeel a lot and doesn't fight at all against adversaries. And even when opportunities present themselves, like in Moiras mine - an enemy beast turns his head close to Frodo and he could have stabbed something in its head but for some reason doesn't - he remains frozen while his fellow travellers do approach with action and kill the enemy doing just that stabbing something in its head. There are also no heroic or smart decisions made by him. The only thing he seems to do, is giving the camera his big blue eyes naive look. You also get a deja vu feeling when the head of the sorcerers switches sides and goes and work for the evil side. Haven't we seen exactly that in Star Wars? Anyway its also in the book so im sure its authentic but nevertheless you get a been there, done that feeling.Then there's the fighting. People get stabbed, shot, mutilated without the slightest drop of blood. An arm gets chopped off, a head gets chopped off but not a splatter in sight. Im sure the directors have done that to give the children not too much of a scare but for the believability of the movie they should have either not shown fighting scenes at all, or give a realistic image of events. The fellowship gets chased by thousands and thousands of Orks in Moira but for some reason they don't catch up fast enough.Then after 3.5 hours the movie suddenly ends without reaching the goal of destroying the ring. I was flabbergasted. What a waste of time. I now understand its the same end from the book albeit without any explanation why. The same was done in Star Wars but at least they gave a satisfying end and a longing to follow its next episode.This is one of the most successful movies ever in terms of box office but i fail to understand why. Maybe people took their kids several times to see Frodo doing nothing much special for 3.5 hours. Maybe some people like to see a movie where the contrast between good and bad has never been depicted in such a black and white way before. Chrystal clear world. You have the utterly good side and the utterly bad side. I don't see the attraction. Fantasy or not it could at least bring some nuance on both sides. Yes there was a reference to evil tempting good but again it was only black and white; they where either totally consumed by it or not. Nothing in between. Which in the end, would be more realistic. Im sure if Saluman (white hair, black eyebrows sorcerer) wanted to recreate Orks, hed done something magic to their teeth but in this movie he didn't and they look hideous. Im sure Gandalf (white hair, white eyebrows sorcerer) has some less altruistic traits but in this movie he is being painted as a saint with only good deeds. It is too much, its an open door and doesn't leave a lot for your imagination. The kind you find in many movies for children. Which in the end it is. It is a laughable, Disney like production made for kids and strict believers in a black and white world. Most grown ups will leave scratching their head. A big thumb down from me.

No other way to put it.This movie ended up on my top ten list when I saw it a few years ago. It is one of the most original thrillers to have come from America and it supposedly became popular solely on the basis of word of mouth.Leonard Shelby(Guy Pearce in an excellent performance) is a man who has short term memory loss. He is a man on a mission. He is determined to find out who killed his wife. He has various ways to remind himself of small facts - writing them on notes and sticking them on the wall, tattooing facts on his body and so on. The story also involves two other characters - Natalie and a man named Teddy who seems to have a shady past. There is also the story of Sammy Jenkis which is told in bits and pieces by Leonard in disjointed scenes. Sammy also had the same problem which led to Sammy being placed in a mental institution.The main feature of this movie is that it goes backwards. Which means that the scene that follows is actually the incident which happens prior to the current situation. This is quite demanding for the viewer and people with short attention spans may not appreciate this movie so much. Repeated viewings may be required to actually understand what is going on in the movie.What I liked about the movie was the fact that despite the complex and confusing style, it is ultimately a movie which is not inaccessible. It is no art film which might bore viewers to tears. It is a fast moving thriller which can keep a viewer hooked and this is what separates Memento from other such complex thrillers. Most importantly, it is the little facts and clues that are the most interesting. The loose ends are tied up expertly at the end with such brilliance that I am still at awe at the execution even several years after watching this movie.Overall, it is in fact quite depressing. There is not one likable character in this movie, except for Leonard, and we see how his medical condition is used by people to serve their own interests. It presents a bleak view of human nature, in many ways.As far as the performances are concerned, Guy Pearce is fabulous as the determined but confused Leonard Shelby. Carrie Anne moss is brilliant as the mysterious Natalie who may have other motives in helping Leonard. She has the right kind of mix of beauty and mysteriousness which make her perfect for the role.

First off, we must realize that Big John is not really a pedophile... that is a lover of boys. He is a lover of adolescents... the proper term would be Ephebophile. However, since common usage has taken over, I will use the term pedophile here although it is not correct.There are two things I thought were good about the ending. First, it reminds us of the negative possibilities to Big John's way of living his desire for young men - in that he leads young men on, but ultimately will ditch them when they become too old for him.It is interesting to note that the young man who kills him does so out of rage from jealousy. He LOVES Big John, and wants his attentions for himself.Now this is already a major point to drive home to the movie-going public. Generally, they have been brought up to think that these boys are VICTIMS... they forget that the boys sometimes are HAPPY to be in the relationship (as long as it is working). The fact that they might get ditched for someone else is NOT just a problem with pedophiles; it happens at some point in almost any love affair.

This is a big production, an A-list science fiction movie! It is also an excellent end of the world adventure. But for me, this movie has a special place in my heart because it has the coolest silver rocket ever to fly in the era just prior to actual space travel -when all rockets were cigar shaped, V-2 derived, silver rockets. Ah! The golden age of the silver rockets! The earth appears to be on a collision course with a sun and planetary body, Bellarus and Zyra respectively. There are debates in the UN about the scientific evidence and whether it is conclusive that a collision will occur. (Ah, what hopes people had back then, of the UN as an authoritative body! A world with science at the core of rational decisions and scientists as the most powerful spokespersons). Many attendees scoff at the conclusion put forward by Dr. Hendron that a collision will occur. His proposed solution is to build fleets of rocket ships to fly colonists to the planet Zyra in hopes of surviving the destruction of planet earth. A few are apparently convinced, and some countries go off and attempt to build their own rockets (we never hear much of their efforts). But it is clear that there will be no organized global effort to build rocket ships. Indeed, it is debated whether rockets can be used for interplanetary travel at all! With the help of a few humanitarian capitalists, Dr. Hendron begins work on a really great looking rocket. It is designed to take off using a sled and rail for added boost, fly through space, and land like a aircraft on the planet Zyra. It is just like the Space Shuttle in concept, only better looking. This is one nifty looking rocket. The ongoing construction of this rocket is the true star of the show. Everything else, plot and character and conflict, revolve around this rocket. Of course, the ship is a Noah's Ark, built to carry a few remnants of humanity and animals to a new world. There are some interesting elements at work in this movie. How do the builders of this modern day Noah's Ark act? Turns out they respond just like Americans did 6-7 years before this movie, at the height of WWII, at the height of American industrial effort. I love watching the construction scenes, the humanitarian contributions of the wealthy capitalists, the self sacrifice and 'can do' spirit that pervaded WWII. The little signs by every calendar and clock which state, 'Waste Anything Except TIME. Time is Our Shortest Material', so like WWII era industrialism. And just like WWII, women are hard at work in the factory. True, they are secondary assistants or technicians, but they are there, holding real jobs, an opportunity women rarely had prior to the war.The characters are one dimensional, stock figures. Perhaps they have to be, there is too much going on in terms of plot and events to develop complex characters. Even so, this is the weakest part of the movie. No one stands out. One exception is the villainous and tyrannical capitalist, Stanton, who is providing much of the finance for this project. In return, he gets to be one of the lucky 40 or so passengers on the ship. He provides most of the energy and emotion in this film. The woman, Joyce Hendron, also stands out, not so much for what she does on screen, but what she represents. She is the new, successful, modern woman of the 1950s. She is smart, and can use a DA (Differential Analyser - a room sized machine probably with all the computing power of a modern calculator), she is confident, capable, and she dresses in snappy and professional work suits. Unfortunately, her character falls into a fairly benign choice between two romantic partners - a doctor and a fly-boy. There are some interesting moral issues in the story. Only 40 people will fit on the rocket. Who gets to go? It ends up a mix of random selection from the rocket factory workers and a hand picked 5-6 people. It is interesting to watch the choices of the picks. For the audience of the time period, the selection process would probably have been viewed as enlightened and fair. It is also interesting to see the self sacrifice and 'for the good of the team' attitudes that mostly prevail. These attitudes would have been comfortable to post-war audiences. Finally, the star and planet loom close and the earth begins to fall apart in earthquakes, floods, volcanoes and the like. This is a very impressive and a well-done segment of the movie. At the very end of the world, just before the rocket takes off, social order breaks down. Just as the tyrant Stanton predicted, a mob is coming for the rocket. They are too late. The rocket blasts off just in time and flies into space, with satisfying visual effects. Has this movie stood the test of time? Can modern viewers watch it and enjoy it? Based on some of the reviews I've read here at IMDb, I dunno. The end of the world and avoiding the extinction of humanity with a desperate gamble of flying to an unknown planet in a rocket is a compelling story. For myself, weak characters and dated outlooks are counterbalanced with the coolest silver rocket ever.

But that's what happened when George Pal directed this iconic film. Taken from the classic novel by H.G.Wells, The War of the Worlds became a major hit in 1953. The story itself takes its cues from the radio program of the same name and has handsome, Gene Barry playing Dr. Clayton Forrester an Astro-physicist who becomes our survival guide and invites admiration as our hero. Ann Robinson is Sylvia Van Buren his student, turned admirer, who easily morphs into his girl. Les Tremayne plays Maj. Gen. Mann, Paul Frees is the walking reporter and Sir Cedric Hardwicke is the films' narrator. For all of its simplistic hokeyness, archival stereotypes, puppet characters and homespun reasoning, this tale of a Martian invasion reminds us of what we once looked like, back when. **** ","genre":"Action, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"21 November 2008","score":"4 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" Whoever made this probably had no idea how to elaborate that 'genius idea' into a whole film.

I think it fails in a point to which Hitchcock was certainly aiming at, but gets it right in other level. Anyway, i think what mattered the most to Hithcock at this point was what i think fails.People who've read other remarks i made on Hitch's films will know that i think he worked in clear phases, motivated by issues he was interested in mastering. So, i think he had a spatial exploration 'Rope phase', another one based on mood\/style, (culminated in North by Northwest) and a third phase where i place this film.This phase has to do with the master trying to find visual\/storytelling solutions to try and enter the abyss of human soul. I imagine that, being already a master in superficial visual manipulation\/storytelling, and having created such essays on how the eye works (Rear Window, Rope, Dial M...) he was interested to know what he might do trying to put the guts of a character in the eyes of an audience. Rough expression, i know, but that's what i feel. The curious thing here is that he made it in his first try, with Vertigo, one of the best films ever. What he did after it was never as sharp and interesting to me. Not Psycho, Birds or this Marnie.The success of Vertigo is that Novak's character fools us as she fools Stewart's and so we wander through the same narrow labyrinthic streets of ignorance as Stewart. That's the device he use, and Hitch's superior ability to make things unfold visually completes the thing.So the point where this film fails is where it was more ambitious in trying to make us work like Marnie, and see the world with her eyes. There is no storytelling device that allows Hitch to use his wonderful visual narration gifts to make the thing work. That's why he has to use the red screen whenever he wants to underline Marnie's state of mind. Except for those moments which are not enough to make to transport us, at least not today's audiences, as spectators we are mere observers to the facts of a woman we sense is disturbed, but we don't really feel in what measure.Also, and this may be Hedren\/Censorship fault, we cannot (at least i couldn't) link to the distorted and repressed sexuality underneath Marnie's frigidity. Maybe on those matters, the film that this theme deserved couldn't be done in 1964. The horse as a escapist element to her mother's sexual repression, the behaviour of repulse as the core of her capacity to attract, or the rape scene (both by Sean's character and the hinted rape when she was a child). Pity, but i don't know whether Hedren would be able to pull this off even without censorship constraints. She just doesn't seem that woman (maybe Novak or Kelly could have done it).What works is what Hitchcock never failed in delivering his visual economy, and how he grabs you in the eye and takes you wherever he wants. There are scenes which are absolutely remarkable on their own. So check the initial scene, how he establishes what Marnie does, her method, her disguise, and the introduction of Sean Connery's character and what he knows. Check the scene of the robbery in Rutland's office, how the perfect framing (in terms of deciding exactly what we see) makes a tense scene and purely visual. And check the relatively celebrated crane shot in the party, it really is masterfully economical and meaningful.
