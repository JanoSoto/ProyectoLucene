Basically the whole movie takes place in one room where a jury of 12 men discuss their verdict for a young man suspected of killing his father. Reading the lines above you might think this is a boring movie, but the plot unfolds, as only one man of the jury is not convinced that the boy is guilty and slowly begins to convince the other members of the jury of his doubt. The story becomes at times a detective story, the jury trying to put together missing pieces of the murder puzzle. This movie shows in a marvelous simple way the mechanism of the justice system, how easily a man can be convicted to the death sentence based on prejudice, subjective declarations of witnesses and an unprofessional defense lawyer. It stresses out the importance of declaring someone not guilty if there is a reasonable doubt in your mind about his guilt. It shows that you should always ask questions and not accept everything on first hand.Besides these simple, yet profound ideas, there is a solid acting from everyone of those 12 jury members. Each is unique in his way, with his own personality,history and background. There is the typical immigrant, the wise guy cracking up jokes, the mediator, the wise old man, the educated man with stiff views of the world, the geek, the self-made man who did not forget where he came from, the choleric, the prejudiced man, the stupid guy who does not give a damn about this trial but only about getting to his football game in time. They don't have names, in fact there is no name mentioned until the very last scene in the movie, each jury member just has a number, yet you distinguish them very easily just by their personality. Some are given more screen time, some less, but they all do some marvelous acting. Last, but not least, the camera and directing! Can I just say, for a movie taking place in one room, it's really amazing...stressing out gestures, faces of people, objects to give depth to the scenes. I'll never forget the scene where one jury member just tries to convince the others of the young boy's guilt, because these people (living in slums) are born this way and they do these things, they're violent, they're animals and one by one, the jury members leave the table, the place of dialog and go to other corners of the room, signaling that they do not wish to continue this conversation. Or the scene where they do a re-enactment of an old man trudging along to reach his front door. Truly, a masterpiece, I recommend it to anyone anytime! 10\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"9 November 2010","score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" This movie shows how you can make a film on the lowest budget possible, with only one or two scene sets and 12 good actors.

What a waste of acting talent. It's incredibly depressing, violent, sexist and bigoted, and while it fully captures the feeling of the time period, it shows the worst of the worst bizarre misfits and losers of the era.Regardless of the very weak script, the actors manage to pull out their skills to raise the level of this movie (slightly). Leguizamo, Sorvino, Brody, LuPone, Neuwirth and Esposito all bring their usual high level of talent and it's certainly not their fault the script is so poorly written and thought out.Lee is always a fine director, even here, but it's my opinion that he should stay behind the camera at all times. He is laughable, at best, as John Jeffries, a very obvious impersonation of John Johnson, an African American local NY reporter for ABC news in the 60s and 70s. He tries to add some levity, but anyone who knows of John Johnson, knows he was 100% serious 100% of the time. Lee even goes so far as to insinuate that the masses thought of him as an oreo cookie, which I'm sure was absolutely not the case for anyone except, maybe, hoodlums and punks. Tacky, very tacky, and insulting to a pioneer in journalism.I personally don't know anyone who thought they could possibly know the killer was amongst them, which was a ridiculous point of the story, and unfortunately, a good deal of the script, as well. It was also another thing that made this movie so disappointing. If that wasn't bad enough, they also suggested that people thought Reggie Jackson was the killer because of the number on his jersey. Oy vey, what a bunch of idiots. I rate this movie O for offensive to everyone, including your intelligence.Michael Imperioli, one of the writers, also makes a pre-Sopranos appearance as a gay club owner. I can only assume he took a few acting lessons before signing with HBO because his performance here (along with his writing) was absolutely horrid. Anthony LaPaglia's Australsian accent was as obvious as the strings on the flying saucers in Plan 9 from Outer Space. Not exactly the previously connected New York Italian Detective he was supposed to portray. He's since improved on that, but it doesn't appear he makes any grand efforts to do so, even today. (In other words, if you can't commit to the profession, go host a talk show.)Bottom line, if you want a GOOD movie about the era, see Saturday Night Fever, which premiered just after all this went down (in real life). 1977 turns out to be an incredibly memorable year, albeit for showing the worst side of human nature (as this movie points out to a fault). Despite that fact, there were a lot of good things happening then. Maybe had the writers stuck to the point of the movie and elaborated on how it affected people's lives (rather than focusing on the side dramas and using the Summer of Sam as a side bar), this actually could've been good.

Michael Winner and his star Charles Bronson really serve up some repulsive punks and creeps in this movie! Hoodlums are running loose and free seemingly unabated by the police(if anything, it appears the police assist them in their methods to terrorize and torment innocent people living in apartments in the location of a veritable hellhole, a street which represents a decrepit, filthy armpit in our country, full to the brim with the worst type of scum and slime). Gavan O'Herlihy's head punk, Fraker, has to register as one of the most repellent, disgustingly loathsome gangleaders ever. He slits an old lady's throat, calls up her husband to relate the news to him and his reason..the guy kicked one of Fraker's guys out of his store! The city streets in this film resemble Beirut for crying out loud and the scene where Kersey walks down blocks firing off rounds from a Browning machine gun like some sort of geriatric Rambo has to be seen to be believed. It's positively surreal. Oh and to see Ed Lauter's police chief, Shrinker, side by side shooting human garbage with Kersey is rather amusing as well. There seems to be a limitless army Fraker had recruited, they just keep coming and coming, dying and dying. Buildings and cars bombed with Molotov cocktails and grenades. Kersey covering a wide area of East New York as he unloads bullets from his Wildey Magnum, quite the crack shot, evading, miraculously, gunfire aimed right at him from the opposition. It's a wild ride and if you are an undemanding action fan who can allow himself to completely align with the absurd plot that unfolds before you, then DEATH WISH III is the ticket. Just a word of warning. This is a Michael Winner film, so the innocent and evil equally suffer. The gorgeous Deborah Raffin is a lawyer who falls for Kersey, a major no-no in DEATH WISH films. Martin Balsam brings some class to this utterly classless film as a neighborhood mechanic for taxi cab parts. I guess the finale covers about 30 minutes of carnage..the city blocks in this film mirror a war zone one might associate with a torn apart Iraq or something. Buildings crumble, women with sack groceries are interrupted rudely and violently, innocent bystanders beaten with chains..it's all eye-popping and bizarre. Most people will consider a film like this an insult to taste and intelligence. For the rest of us, it's jawdroppingly awesome.

In addition there were so many characters, and one after the other kept coming and coming and it was hard to keep track of them. What was even more frustrating was how the zombies kept coming back after being killed multiple times.

The movie follows Turner as he tries to put together the pieces and figure out exactly what's happening.Redford's performance was all right, but in all honesty this wasn't the strongest performance of his career.

Unfortunately, neither character was particularly believable. Turner - self-described as no spy but rather simply as a guy who reads books, nevertheless seemed to come across as a pretty accomplished cloak and dagger type. The relatively quick development of the relationship between Turner and Kathy detracted from the latter character's credibility, as did her apparently quick and easy entrance into Turner's activity.This isn't especially an action movie - although it has action moments. It's more of a behind the scenes look at the intelligence community and its ways. It has some mildly effective twists, and a resolution to the mystery of why Turner's colleagues were killed, although the movie ended on a bit of an open ended note, with a great deal of uncertainty about what Turner's ultimate fate would be.

I'd say the same for movies. And I just needed a few minutes into the movie to recognize the work of a master. The whole AN is contained in its beginning the burning jungle, a temple, the choppers, an upside down world as seen by an stoned Willard, our eyes and ears for the next 2,5 hours. He'll be our interpreter. He'll be us. His whispering recollection gives me such a feeling of intimacy; it's like Willard is talking to me from the heart, making me a part of his story.This movie is so accomplished, and in so many levels, it may be considered as several masterpieces in one. Every one of its episodes could be a movie by itself. Coppola once said, AN is Vietnam, but I'd go even further AN is the 70s, the entire decade. The 70s are back for me every time I see it.Many reviewers have already expounded on the overall merits of this movie, so I won't add to that, preferring instead to focus on one episode where I think Coppola excels, because this is a bit where almost nothing is happening; there's no drama, no tension, ordeal, nothing to build on the USO show. A lesser filmmaker would have, either felt overwhelmed by the task and taken the easy way out--installing a few static cameras here and there--or lazily taken things in stride...and done the same. But not Coppola. With an incredible use of traveling cameras; pulsating, wandering lights; chopper blades, he makes us posses the entire show. He puts us everywhere; above, in the crowd, in the stage and, despite of this being a tremendously dynamic sequence, we are able to tightly follow everything happening in it and focus our attention in at least four crucial elements the dancing bunnies, the crowd going crazy, the apprehensive manager and, finally, a bemused Willard, which provides for a mirror where we see reflected our own reactions. This bit should be mandatory viewing for every film student. So, AN could have been a perfect classic, had not been for those new added, useless, scenes in Redux (and for...oh, well, that later). This is why they are uselessThe first added bit destroys Kilgore's character. It reveals him as an immature clown, pathologically attached to his surf board. It does it also with Willard's, as we known him to be a humourless guy who never smiles or cracks a joke. And suddenly he is a little kid playing hide & seek. Even worse, the episode forges a bond between him and the crew, based in their complicity when challenging authority. The second bit destroys another strong symbol the bunnies. These women are beautiful, squeaky clean, resplendent and smell like Heavens. And because they are such heavenly creatures they represent all what those men are missing and what are probably got back at home love, sensuality, etc. But the girls are also unreachable, the stuff from which wet dreams are made. They have come from above and to above retreat when the male crowd try to reach them. But Coppola destroys that symbol also, when showing them stranded&#x97;just as the men&#x97;dirty, surrounded by death and decay. They have become simple, ordinary, women. In China Beach they may have a place, but not here; here they have become useless, as AN is all about symbols and their value as symbols has been just obliterated.Then we have the third bit. What's bad about it is not that is about yelling Frenchmen, but that it shows us nascent analysis, explanations, and that's not what AN is all about. AN is about living experiences and having fresh thoughts on them--That kid blasts my balls, for ex.--and about symbols, not about sitting back and go delving on past events, even if such events are relevant to the present. The moment we retreat from the action, the forward movement of things, and start pondering, we lose the momentum and the movie drags on. Even worse, The French tend to give existential twists to their verbal exchanges and in this case that distracts us even more from the main story the river trip.Now, I know that Brando is God to many and that I'll probably have to get a panic room after saying it, but I'll say it anyway he wasn't the best possible Kurtz. For the bit of camera time he got, any good actor in Hollywood could have done it, especially one I have in mind. Now, put yourself in Willard's shoes you have made a long trip in a dinghy with a gang of potheads who hate you and which skipper even tries to spear you, and you have taken all the crap just because you're fascinated with Kurtz's and you can't wait to meet him, expecting to find a cross between Dr. Moriarty & Hannibal Lecter. And what do you find...? A morose, fat, slacker lying on a couch. You expected evil and what you got is Fred Flinstone alone at home for the last two months. And if you don't agree, let me recall that scene where Willard meets Colby. Remember that tall, lean, mean SOAG; that beautiful, psycho, assassin's stare in his eyes?

The whole AN is contained in its beginning the burning jungle, a temple, the choppers, an upside down world as seen by an stoned Willard, our eyes and ears for the next 2,5 hours. He'll be our interpreter. He'll be us. His whispering recollection gives me such a feeling of intimacy; it's like Willard is talking to me from the heart, making me a part of his story.This movie is so accomplished, and in so many levels, it may be considered as several masterpieces in one. Every one of its episodes could be a movie by itself. Coppola once said, AN is Vietnam, but I'd go even further AN is the 70s, the entire decade. The 70s are back for me every time I see it.Many reviewers have already expounded on the overall merits of this movie, so I won't add to that, preferring instead to focus on one episode where I think Coppola excels, because this is a bit where almost nothing is happening; there's no drama, no tension, ordeal, nothing to build on the USO show. A lesser filmmaker would have, either felt overwhelmed by the task and taken the easy way out--installing a few static cameras here and there--or lazily taken things in stride...and done the same. But not Coppola. With an incredible use of traveling cameras; pulsating, wandering lights; chopper blades, he makes us posses the entire show. He puts us everywhere; above, in the crowd, in the stage and, despite of this being a tremendously dynamic sequence, we are able to tightly follow everything happening in it and focus our attention in at least four crucial elements the dancing bunnies, the crowd going crazy, the apprehensive manager and, finally, a bemused Willard, which provides for a mirror where we see reflected our own reactions. This bit should be mandatory viewing for every film student. So, AN could have been a perfect classic, had not been for those new added, useless, scenes in Redux (and for...oh, well, that later). This is why they are uselessThe first added bit destroys Kilgore's character. It reveals him as an immature clown, pathologically attached to his surf board. It does it also with Willard's, as we known him to be a humourless guy who never smiles or cracks a joke. And suddenly he is a little kid playing hide & seek. Even worse, the episode forges a bond between him and the crew, based in their complicity when challenging authority. The second bit destroys another strong symbol the bunnies. These women are beautiful, squeaky clean, resplendent and smell like Heavens. And because they are such heavenly creatures they represent all what those men are missing and what are probably got back at home love, sensuality, etc. But the girls are also unreachable, the stuff from which wet dreams are made. They have come from above and to above retreat when the male crowd try to reach them. But Coppola destroys that symbol also, when showing them stranded&#x97;just as the men&#x97;dirty, surrounded by death and decay. They have become simple, ordinary, women. In China Beach they may have a place, but not here; here they have become useless, as AN is all about symbols and their value as symbols has been just obliterated.Then we have the third bit. What's bad about it is not that is about yelling Frenchmen, but that it shows us nascent analysis, explanations, and that's not what AN is all about. AN is about living experiences and having fresh thoughts on them--That kid blasts my balls, for ex.--and about symbols, not about sitting back and go delving on past events, even if such events are relevant to the present. The moment we retreat from the action, the forward movement of things, and start pondering, we lose the momentum and the movie drags on. Even worse, The French tend to give existential twists to their verbal exchanges and in this case that distracts us even more from the main story the river trip.Now, I know that Brando is God to many and that I'll probably have to get a panic room after saying it, but I'll say it anyway he wasn't the best possible Kurtz. For the bit of camera time he got, any good actor in Hollywood could have done it, especially one I have in mind. Now, put yourself in Willard's shoes you have made a long trip in a dinghy with a gang of potheads who hate you and which skipper even tries to spear you, and you have taken all the crap just because you're fascinated with Kurtz's and you can't wait to meet him, expecting to find a cross between Dr. Moriarty & Hannibal Lecter. And what do you find...? A morose, fat, slacker lying on a couch. You expected evil and what you got is Fred Flinstone alone at home for the last two months. And if you don't agree, let me recall that scene where Willard meets Colby. Remember that tall, lean, mean SOAG; that beautiful, psycho, assassin's stare in his eyes?

That might seem odd, given the many surface differences between this movie and the rest of the genre. The story is set in a bright and cheerful small town, not the dark and menacing inner city. Most of its characters are much more normal, upright and socially functional. There's relatively little violence here and a great deal of humor. But under the surface and beyond Hitchcock's artistry, the black and cynical blood of noir courses through this film's veins.Shadow of a Doubt spins around the axis of young Charlotte Charlie Newton (Teresa Wright) and her namesake Uncle Charlie (Joseph Cotten). Charlie is a far too earnest girl who chafes at the ordinary life of her ordinary family in her ordinary home town of Santa Rosa, California. She especially laments the life of family service that defines her mother, Emma (Patricia Collinge). When flamboyant and irrepressible Uncle Charlie comes to town for a visit, young Charlie is ecstatic. Not only because Emma is overjoyed to be reunited with her baby brother, who brings to life all her most cherished memories, but because the two Charlies aren't just uncle and niece. They're kindred spirits that recognize they are different than other people.However, Uncle Charlie isn't just visiting his dear relatives. He's on the run from the East Coast, pursued by two detectives, and from his very first moments on screen, the audience is shown a bleak darkness that simmers under Uncle Charlie's audacious charm. He is a man with a secret, one that's eating away at him and will forever change the life of his beloved niece.Like just about all his other movies, Shadow of a Doubt is filled with striking and powerful imagery. There are some young fools who don't appreciate Hitchcock's greatness and it is easy to understand why. By the time they get around to watching his work, they've seen his style and techniques aped by innumerable lesser filmmakers. Even with today's technology, many directors are still following in Hitchcock's footsteps. They're just going a step or two past the physical, material limitations he faced. It's only when you ponder how a movie made nearly 70 years ago can look and flow better than most modern films that you can appreciate the genius at work.The chief argument against putting this movie in the film noir genre is that it does not embrace and wallow in the blackness of life. It doesn't cast evil as the truth and good as merely pretense, but Hitchcock and his writers infuse almost every inch of this ordinary family and their ordinary lives with pain and anger and unease. It's not only Uncle Charlie's hidden malevolence or young Charlie's awakening rage. It's Emma's profound sadness at the childhood she desperately wishes she had back. It's Charlie's father Joseph (Henry Tavers) feeling uncomfortable at Uncle Charlie superseding him in the family dynamic. There's also Joseph's unusual hobby of talking with fellow detective magazine fan Herbie Hawkins (Hume Cronyn) about the best way the two of them could murder each other. The burned out waitress in the dance hall where the two Charlies have their first confrontation is a girl Charlie's age but with all the life beaten out of her. The difference between the two couldn't be more stark. Shadow of a Doubt is all about the mean underside of human existence and how it seeps up into the sunny surface.There are also some excellent performances on display here, something for which Hitchcock films are not always known. Teresa Wright and Joseph Cotten are spectacular. Henry Travers and Patricia Collinge are amazing. These are probably some of the most real and genuine characters to ever be in a Hitchcock movie.Capped off with a truly wicked ending, Sadow of a Doubt is a great motion picture. It's not surprising Hitchcock called it his favorite film. Watch it and it might be yours.

If anyone could be said to have been the godfather for what happens at Industrial Light and Magic, it's Trumbull.Silent Running was Trumbull's first try at directing. And he did a good job. Of course, he had great help - Michael Cimino and Steven Bochco were two of the screenwriters on this movie; it shows in the dialogue, which is taut and crisp. The cinematography, especially in the opening titles, is nothing short of amazing; they even made Joan Baez sing something worthwhile for the opening theme.The action Earth has managed to amputate its environment. No flora, no fauna but humans living inside. All the plants, animals, all the wildlife has been moved off-planet to geodesic domes in space (as to why put the stuff in space? there's no objective reason that really holds water to a serious sci-fi buff, but it does set up the resolution of the plot). Bruce Dern plays the last dedicated conservationist, on one of the spacecraft carrying the wildlife.The opening tragedy the bean counters back on Earth decide they can't afford to tie up all those spacecraft to save a few hundred trees and bunnies, so the crews of the spacecraft are ordered to use miniature nuclear devices to humanely destroy all the wildlife in space.Bruce Dern's character can't reconcile following those orders with the passion of his life to save Earth's wildlife. And there is the action of the film - he fights, he resists, he refuses, and he acts.This is a strong, violent, thrilling ride. You don't have to be a tree-hugger to enjoy it; the movie converts you to its point of view - Trumbull, his writers and his cast do what good movie makers do, they convince you to suspend any skepticism you may have about what happens in the film.This is one of the few science fiction films I come back to again, and again for enjoyment, because it rises over its few flaws to captivate and entertain.
