Death Wish is an enjoyable and entertaining vigilante thriller that somehow contrives to keep you watching, despite Bronson's hollow, one-dimensional performance as the grief-stricken architect who finds solace in dealing a little rough justice with a sock full of quarters and a handgun. Herbie Hancock's score is both chilling and expressive, enhancing and altering the mood of the film without being too intrusive, and there are some neat touches in the script - for example, after Bronson clobbers his first thug, he is so shaken he has to pour himself a whisky to calm down, and after his first kill he actually vomits - these things make him more human and believable than the sadistic automaton he becomes in that wretched sequel. Vincent Gardenia is excellent as the cynical, hard-bitten cop on his trail, and the aftermath of Kathleen Tolan's gang rape (which is mercifully seen only in glimpses shot in fast-edited wobbly-cam) is responsibly and harrowingly depicted - she is so traumatized she even screams in fear when her own husband touches her. There's also some necessary comic relief - the old lady who goes after hoods with a hatpin, the nose-picking hookers, the building site crew who make sure a mugger never does it again - and Gardenia's reaction when he sees his face on the cover of a magazine is a joy to behold!There are also a couple of cameos that will make you laugh, even though the film-makers couldn't have anticipated it at the time. Firstly, one of the rapists is Jeff Goldblum. Correct - the master of geeky neurotic roles as a rapist. Cruel as this sounds, I laughed really hard, particularly at his jittery delivery of the line Don't jive Mother, you kno-o-ow what we wa-ant! Then, near the end, Christopher Guest, best known as the gormless Nigel Tufnel from Rob Reiner's classic This Is Spinal Tap (1984) turns up as a cop! Just the sight of his face makes me laugh and remember his amplifier that goes to 11...but that's just nitpicking isn't it!All in all, Death Wish is a solid little movie that will pass ninety minutes enjoyably enough. It's not great, but you will be riveted until the end. Shame Winner and Bronson got greedy and made those revolting sequels.

Requiem For A Dream is extremely moving and powerful and REAL and it could only bring out the worst of any type of mind-altering substance. I watched this film stone sober and in the middle of the night, and when it was over I was almost afraid that the sun wasn't going to come up in the morning. This is one of the most powerful anti-drug movies to have been released in years.And the thing that really sets this film apart is that it is not a crash course in all of the bad side effects of drugs. There are numerous characters in several different storylines that all converge and deliver a unique message. This is one of the things that made movies like American Beauty so good, there is just so much going on. The film is a spiraling downfall for all of the characters involved, but it manages to have an unusually strong impact because of its realism, which is ironic because one of the film's strong points is its striking use of editing. There is a constant use of creative and disorienting editing and cinematography, which gives the film a feeling of being a little off at all times, but it manages to remain realistic enough not to lose any impact.As far as editing, I was particularly impressed with the creative use of the split screen. The film starts off with a scene in which Harry (Jared Leto) borrows his mother's television set, and she is so upset that she locks herself in the other room. In the split screen, we see Harry from two different angles, and on one side, we see broken shots, while the other side shows continuous action. This is done with multiple cameras, so it's not the sheer difficulty that I noticed as much as the creativeness. And of course, being a drug film, it is full of interesting and sometimes disturbing editing and cinematography.Jared Leto is excellent as Harry Goldfarb, a junkie who wants to sell enough drugs to really support himself, his girlfriend, his partner in trafficking (Tyrone), and most importantly, his mother. The relationship between Harry and his mother Sarah is the one from which the majority of the emotion in the film is derived, as well as from his girlfriend Marion's descent into drug-induced prostitution. Ellen Burstyn is stunningly effective as Sarah Goldfarb, Harry's mother, who lives exactly the existence that you spend your entire youth hoping to never have to live. She is alone, she's overweight and unattractive, and she's so obsessed with getting onto a stupid TV show just one time that she goes on such an intense crash diet that she literally drives herself insane. The antagonistic refrigerator, by the way, is one of the more interesting things about the film, and should also be noted for its originality. What was the last respectable film you saw in which an inanimate object like a refrigerator was made to have such a successfully menacing presence? Jennifer Connelly has changed dramatically from the cute actress that we saw in older movies like Labyrinth and Career Opportunities and The Rocketeer. In Requiem For A Dream, she delivers a spectacular performance, proving her skill as an actor. But it is the performance from Marlon Wayans that is by far the most surprising and noteworthy. He plays the part of Tyrone with such amazing skill that it is almost impossible to believe that this is the same idiot that we saw in the god-awful Scary Movies. Way to go, Marlon, but stick with the movies that can be enjoyed by people with more than one brain cell in operation, like Requiem For A Dream.(spoilers) Another thing that this movie does on more than one occasion is give an example of How People Get Like That. Every time I see or hear about a homeless person or a mental patient (which is not often, I admit) or a woman so strung out on drugs that she would sell her body to get her fix, I always wonder what must have happened in that person's life for them to have wound up like that. Requiem For A Dream provides a perfectly plausible story in which a nice but rather pathetic woman becomes obsessed with her chance to appear on television and winds up getting electro-shock therapy against her will in a mental hospital, and then we see that Marion winds up engaging in lesbian shows for crowds of drunken jerk-offs, and Harry shoots up so much in the same arm that he has to have it amputated. These are the kinds of things that make you wonder how they got like that, and in this movie we see how it happened and its believable.Requiem for a Dream is not one of the most cheery movies I've ever seen, in fact, it is downright disturbing at many points, but it is powerful and effective and should be noted for that. The film is photographed and edited in creative and interesting ways, which not only makes it fascinating to watch but also enhances the drug element of the film, which was also a technique used with huge success in the must more well known film Traffic. There is a lot of difficult to watch material in this movie, but it is a very well thought out film. Not for the weak of heart, but this is an excellent piece of cinematography.

Requiem For A Dream is extremely moving and powerful and REAL and it could only bring out the worst of any type of mind-altering substance. I watched this film stone sober and in the middle of the night, and when it was over I was almost afraid that the sun wasn't going to come up in the morning. This is one of the most powerful anti-drug movies to have been released in years.And the thing that really sets this film apart is that it is not a crash course in all of the bad side effects of drugs. There are numerous characters in several different storylines that all converge and deliver a unique message. This is one of the things that made movies like American Beauty so good, there is just so much going on. The film is a spiraling downfall for all of the characters involved, but it manages to have an unusually strong impact because of its realism, which is ironic because one of the film's strong points is its striking use of editing. There is a constant use of creative and disorienting editing and cinematography, which gives the film a feeling of being a little off at all times, but it manages to remain realistic enough not to lose any impact.As far as editing, I was particularly impressed with the creative use of the split screen. The film starts off with a scene in which Harry (Jared Leto) borrows his mother's television set, and she is so upset that she locks herself in the other room. In the split screen, we see Harry from two different angles, and on one side, we see broken shots, while the other side shows continuous action. This is done with multiple cameras, so it's not the sheer difficulty that I noticed as much as the creativeness. And of course, being a drug film, it is full of interesting and sometimes disturbing editing and cinematography.Jared Leto is excellent as Harry Goldfarb, a junkie who wants to sell enough drugs to really support himself, his girlfriend, his partner in trafficking (Tyrone), and most importantly, his mother. The relationship between Harry and his mother Sarah is the one from which the majority of the emotion in the film is derived, as well as from his girlfriend Marion's descent into drug-induced prostitution. Ellen Burstyn is stunningly effective as Sarah Goldfarb, Harry's mother, who lives exactly the existence that you spend your entire youth hoping to never have to live. She is alone, she's overweight and unattractive, and she's so obsessed with getting onto a stupid TV show just one time that she goes on such an intense crash diet that she literally drives herself insane. The antagonistic refrigerator, by the way, is one of the more interesting things about the film, and should also be noted for its originality. What was the last respectable film you saw in which an inanimate object like a refrigerator was made to have such a successfully menacing presence? Jennifer Connelly has changed dramatically from the cute actress that we saw in older movies like Labyrinth and Career Opportunities and The Rocketeer. In Requiem For A Dream, she delivers a spectacular performance, proving her skill as an actor. But it is the performance from Marlon Wayans that is by far the most surprising and noteworthy. He plays the part of Tyrone with such amazing skill that it is almost impossible to believe that this is the same idiot that we saw in the god-awful Scary Movies. Way to go, Marlon, but stick with the movies that can be enjoyed by people with more than one brain cell in operation, like Requiem For A Dream.(spoilers) Another thing that this movie does on more than one occasion is give an example of How People Get Like That. Every time I see or hear about a homeless person or a mental patient (which is not often, I admit) or a woman so strung out on drugs that she would sell her body to get her fix, I always wonder what must have happened in that person's life for them to have wound up like that. Requiem For A Dream provides a perfectly plausible story in which a nice but rather pathetic woman becomes obsessed with her chance to appear on television and winds up getting electro-shock therapy against her will in a mental hospital, and then we see that Marion winds up engaging in lesbian shows for crowds of drunken jerk-offs, and Harry shoots up so much in the same arm that he has to have it amputated. These are the kinds of things that make you wonder how they got like that, and in this movie we see how it happened and its believable.Requiem for a Dream is not one of the most cheery movies I've ever seen, in fact, it is downright disturbing at many points, but it is powerful and effective and should be noted for that. The film is photographed and edited in creative and interesting ways, which not only makes it fascinating to watch but also enhances the drug element of the film, which was also a technique used with huge success in the must more well known film Traffic. There is a lot of difficult to watch material in this movie, but it is a very well thought out film. Not for the weak of heart, but this is an excellent piece of cinematography.

Throughout the entire movie, the characters were being chased by one dinosaur or another, with little else.  Dinosaur attacks are good and all, but a good movie needs some breaks in between for characters to develop, etc. You could tell that several characters were expendable from the start (i.e. the parasail operators and the mercenaries), which eliminated any surprise. In contrast, no main character died, even though two came close. The Spinosaurus, which was the main dino in the film, was poorly done, because it looked rather robotic.  It also seemed to go after the people relentlessly, which is cool if it's a smart dinosaur like the raptors, but the spino was big and dumb, and it could've gone after any other dinosaurs. There certainly wasn't any shortage of them.  Why is this dinosaur featured so prominantly in this film if it never appeared in The Lost World? The raptors got worse also.  They got smart and could make sophisticated noises though an air chamber of some sort.  At one scene, they appear to be carrying on a conversation as if they were cartoons.  They never had any really cool raptor surprises.  Twice, Grant was surrounded and twice he got away, the second time by blowing on a horn. On the brighter side, Grant got friendlier, while still giving the impression of a tough guy.  He even had a few funny lines in the movie. The Pteradactyl scene was awesome; it was great how the one was walking down the catwalk towards the kid in the mist.  They alone made the movie worth seeing on the big screen.

But even so, I must say that Tim Burton's Planet of the Apes is a mess of great effects, especially makeup, shoddy story-telling and with two exceptions badly written characters.  The story consists of Mark Wahlberg as an Air Force pilot named Leo, in the near future, on a space station where he ends up getting time warped to an alternate universe where apes rule humans. Of course Leo gets caught but not to worry, thanks to an sympathetic ape (Helena Bonham Carter), he and several humans, along with Carter and another ape, escape and try to find a way to a place where Leo thinks his ship is waiting for him (he has a device, that he got from his crashed pod, that is leading them along the way to wherever the place might be). But of course apes find them and a huge battle ensues.  That's pretty much it for the plot, now to the characters. Carter does a good job as the human loving ape Ari, but Wahlberg is a bore as the film's hero Leo, Estella Warren (Driven) isn't very good either but Michael Clarke Duncan is okay as a Gorilla general though his brain pattern seems to be, growl, yell, beat someone up, yell again... and so on. The standout in the movie has to be Tim Roth's character General Thade, the film's main villain. Thade is the most animated and fascinating of all of the characters and Roth gives the role plenty of emotional power, which basically blows away anyone else on screen with him. I'd actually be interested to see a spinoff movie centering on the Thade character is explained more in depth.  Most of the characters are a bore and some are killed off so fast we (the audience) never know who the are.   Lastly, the makeup effects are very well done. The actors actually look like apes or gorillas or whatever. Again, Roth does the most with his character and the makeup fits the Thade character very well.  Overall it's not a good movie, the choppy story and mostly bad characters take away what little good stuff the film had to begin with. To finish up, Roth is good but the rest of the flick is bad. Oh and the ending (which doesn't make a lot of sense, compared to the rest of the film) is silly and leaves this one wide open for a sequel, oh goody (note the heavy sarcasm here).

This movie is like Chainsaw-light or The Texas Chainsaw Massacre for dummies. A real shame.Even good actors like Renée Zellweger and Matthew McConaughey can't save this movie. Zellweger's performance felt fake as hell and McConaughey's psycho also seemed fake and over the top.Yet another problem is the lack of realism. Zellweger's character jumps from panicky mode to action hero mode to can't-really-act-scared mode. McConaughey's character cuts himself with his knife, but doesn't seem to bleed at all except for a thin strip of blood.All in all, you can watch this movie. If you are a big fan of the series you will feel compelled to. Just don't do the mistake I did and buy it. It is simply a bad bad movie.

He was also a driving force in the creation of the original, having read the original book and helping to bring it to the attention of the money men in Hollywood and carrying it from original concept to final completion.In fact, the original movie is such a classic, it spawned 4 sequals and 2 TV series (1 live action and one animated).  It's influence was so wide, that when Welcome Back Kotter premiered on TV, the character Arnold Horshack carried a POTA lunchbox wherever he went.This new version in many ways is both closer to the original book, and also deviates much more.The effects and makeup in this version are spectacular.  Much as the original revolutionized makeup for decades to come, this one will also show it's influence for a long time.  Rather then use computer graphics to create the apes, the use of makeup and appliances is spectacular.Tim Burton did a fantastic job on this movie.  And of course, what is a Tim Burton movie without Danny Elfman doing the musical score.  Combined, they have made a movie that is sure to be a classic for years to come.One of the biggest differences is that the classes of ape are not as seperated as they were in the original.In the original, Chimps all wore green and were scientists.  Gorillas wore black and were military, and Orangutangs wore orange and were clergy\/politicians.  In this they are more diverse, and there even seems to be hints of cross-species breeding.  This makes for a much more diverse history, and more potential for both conflict and support.Also, the humans in this version are able to talk, but they strive to hide that fact from the apes.  And as the humans are more human then in the original, the apes are more ape like.  They frequently jump around and climb on things, write with their feet, touch and groom each other, and in general are more like evolved apes should be.The cast is excellent, with both Michael Clarke Duncan and Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa playing excellent roles.  Michael Clarke Duncan is one of the best new actors in the business today, and this role is as far as possible from The Green Mile.Tim Burton added several subtle and not so subtle pokes and images from both the original and contemporary society into the movie.  From Charlton uttering his classic Damn them all to hell again, to an Orangutang saying the Rodney King line Can't we all just get along, to having another orangutang rub himself with flower petals while upside down, very reminiscant to American Beauty.Of course, the most memorable part of the original movie is the ending. The image of Charlton Heston looking at the wreckage of the Statue Of Liberty is forever burned into our minds.  In much the same way, this ending will also be burned into our minds.  And in many ways, the ending this time is much closer to the original ending as written by Pierre Boulle.I am curious to how they will do a sequal to this movie.  In today's market, everything from American Pie to Wayne's World have sequals.  And this is really the first time that a movie spawned a series of sequals (the 007 movies do not count, since they do not sequal in any order, and were based on a series of books).  So it will be interesting to see if this movie spawns a similar series of sequals.If you loved the original movie, you have to see this one.In addition to Charlton Heston, look for a cameo by Linda Harrison, the actress that played Nova in the original movies.
