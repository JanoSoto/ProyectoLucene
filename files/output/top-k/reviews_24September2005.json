I hadn't seen many of the Bond films at that time so I really didn't get that many of the jokes. Some time ago I bought the DVD don't ask me why but I did and being older and having seen quite a few of the Bond films I really grew to appreciate the humor and the general mood of the film. Mike Myers is undoubtedly the best man who could ever spoof James Bond because he is pretty much the complete opposite of Bond. He is unattractive (especially with the fake teeth he uses in this film) and he doesn't come off as being sophisticated or any good in a fight so for him to play an irresistible swinger is immensely funny in itself.Mike Myers does a good job with the character(s) and brings a certain charm to both Austin Powers and Doctor Evil. It is obvious that Myers is inspired by Peter Sellers in the fact that he plays more than one character (something he will bring even further in the following films) and he does a very good job. He also pulls off a semi-believable British accent giving the character of Austin Powers an extra level of credibility. Austin Powers is the most interesting character in the film and his chemistry with Vanessa Kensington (Elizabeth Hurley) Makes their scenes together the most interesting and funny in the film. Doctor Evil is funny the first time but quite frankly isn't as interesting as Powers making his scenes less reviewable. Elizabeth Hurley is hot and thus works great as a love interest for Austin. She is the best of Austin's girls in any of the films. The supporting cast is decent as well. Michael York, Robert Wagner and Mindy Sterling all do great jobs.There are a lot of references and spoofs of the original Bond films that work great. A few examples are a Chinese henchman called Random Task an obvious reference to the greatest of the Bond films where there was a similar Chinese henchman called Oddjob, a woman called Alotta Fagina referencing the fact that many Bond girls had names you could read differently. Dr. Evil looks a lot like Ernst Stavro Blofeld the only recurring super villain of the Bond films as we saw him in You Only Live Twice (I wouldn't call Jaws a super villain as he is a henchman).The film is, however, lacking an interesting story. There is a story but it isn't that interesting. I found the story in the second film to be much more original and fresh and this drags down a bit. It doesn't change the fact that Austin Powers is a funny film that deserves at least one viewing.All in all 6\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"24 September 2005","score":"4 out of 9 people found the following review useful","review":" The first time I saw Austin Powers International Man of Mystery I was actually disappointed.

Still, I will never forgive the makers of sequels 2, 4, 5, 6, even 3 and 7 for taking one of the greatest horror stories ever told and turning it into something so laughable. With Part IV Freddy Krueger was more of an antihero for the MTV generation than ever before. What was then hip is now ridiculous and director Renny Harlin's endeavor to make the movie as stylish as possible certainly doesn't make this entry in the series any spookier.The first 5 minutes of part IV alone show everything that's wrong about the movie. An awful rock song sung by Tuesday Knight (who replaces Patricia Arquette as Kristen) plays over a little girl drawing something. The camera pans away and we see it's a painting of Freddy's house on Elm Street. Kirsten approaches and asks the girl where Freddy was. The girl replies that Freddy wasn't in, then laughs hysterically and disappears. Why? No one knows. Kristen goes inside the house. Why? No idea, but the camera follows her with such an amateurish movement it's the first time this movie is unintentionally funny. Inside the house Kristen jumps because she sees a shadow of something that appears to be a claw on the wall. When she takes a closer look, though, it turns out that this was just an illusion created by a branch that looks NOTHING like the shadow.

After not having seen the film in a while, last week my girlfriend and I, pulled it out and watched it on a rainy, stormy night.Misery is an excellent film, based on King's novel. Since watching the film again, I went to my bookshelf, and reread the novel in three nights. I'll tell you one thing. I'll take the movie Annie over the novel Annie, if I was in that situation. If you haven't read the novel, I suggest you do. In the movie, there are times when Annie Wilkes is quite likable. But not so in the novel.The movie is a great suspense film, greatly acted by Kathy Bates and James Caan. You can actually put yourself in Paul Sheldon's shoes, and picture it being you. At times you want to yell at the screen and say, Paul, don't say that. You're gonna make her mad. This poor man, totally disabled and at the mercy of the insane Annie. I read that James Caan said this was one of his toughest roles to play, because he was in bed or a wheelchair through the whole film. He went stir crazy. That probably helped him with his performance.These are some of the things that were not shown, and toned down in the film. The film never shows that Annie got Paul addicted to pain killers. She made him drink dirty dishwater to swallow his pills. In the film, the hobbling scene is quite horrid. But in the novel, he not only loses his foot with an axe, but other things as well. I won't ruin it. There are other things not depicted in the film, like Annie leaving Paul for fifty hours, forcing him to drink his own urine. Like I said, I'd take the Annie from the film over the novel Annie, without a doubt.The movie stays suspenseful because you feel so bad for this man. He's helpless. The only person keeping him alive, is a sick, twisted, f***, to use Paul's words. Annie Wilkes reminds me of a kid that likes to light kittens on fire, or tear the wings off butterflies. But always telling Paul she loves him, and it's for his own good.When I saw the film in the theater in 1990, the audience cheered for Paul at the end.

Who cares every other word is the 'f' word or the 's' word? This movie is about three things 1, to stand up for censorship and the fact that we shouldn't take so seriously. 2, to show parents that they need to worry more about what their kids know and learn rather then worry about what they're watching. And, 3, to LAUGH and HAVE A GOOD TIME! 1 Censorship has it's ups and it's downs. It's ups are that people are comfortable with watching censored shows so they won't get offended. It's downs are when it is taken to far and people go too far with it trying to blame everybody and everything...everyone except themselves. That is what is shown that is wrong with our country. We see something as insignificant as this, and if given the chance, we would seriously start a war rather than take the blame. We've gone into a world where America is never wrong, when in fact, it has about a million more things wrong with it than it does right. Also, this movie deals with censorship in language more than anything else (that's why it swears so much, so people can realize that 'hey, these are just WORDS. Words don't hurt!') Because that's exactly it. Words don't hurt. But violence and some graphic sensuality is seen on TV all the time. Recently, I saw a movie on TV that was edited down, so we didn't hear the 'f' or 's' word, but we still saw a guy's head being cut off. That's right, a guy's HEAD being CUT OFF. Uncensored. But thank God our kids didn't hear the bad words. What's good about this movie is that the parents realized that the deaths and violence in the war they caused was way worse than their kids hearing some naughty words and profanity\/vulgarity. Unfortunately, in today's world, parents will never learn.2 Parents need to worry about being parents. Not fighters. That is what Kyle is talking about in the end. What he says isn't just about him and his mom, it's about every kid in the world and every mom in the world. Particularly in America. If kids are watching bad shows or R-rated movies, than it's up to parents to tell them what's right or wrong and decide if the kids should watch these things. Not go so far as to suing or fighting the creators of the bad shows. You can't just shield all bad programs from kids and expect them to all understand it when they're 18. Basically, you need to start small and end big. Show them G-rated programs and Nick Jr. cartoons until about 6 or 7. Then start with PG movies. These movies have very little offensive material, and it starts small so it can build up to PG-13. Kids will ask what does 'damn' mean or why did they hit each other and you, as parents, explain. Then they understand what they mean and whether they are good or bad. Then, around 10 or 11 you can start with PG-13, with a lot more subjectional material. Slowly, they begin to build with what they feel is right or wrong and understanding it all. And then when they can start watching R-rated movies, they are all different, so pick certain ones and build from there (however, the South Park movie, Team America, and similar movies can wait till the end). Then, when they are 18, they will know what their parents consider wrong and right and can build their own opinions on wrong and right and decide how they want it to be in their own adult lives.Whew. Now...3 Humor. This movie is a comedy. If you can't laugh at it, then you have a very low sense of humor. But you are entitled to your opinion. But leave us fans alone. I've heard the complainers say they don't like it because of the excessive language. That is the whole point of the movie, der! To prove that language doesn't hurt us, they are just words. And if it's because it's annoying, then just ignore it. I personally didn't find the excessive language annoying, and I don't know why it can be annoying when it's used in perfect situations in this movie! Anyway, if you don't like this movie, stop wasting your time bitching about it.So, in conclusion, this is just a movie. Don't take it seriously, and just treat it like it is. It's meant for you to have a fun time, and if you didn't then that's too bad. If you did, then that's what the creators wanted. I give this movie a 10\/10. In a weird way, the most profanic cartoon in the world has taught me a lot. South Park can do that to you ).

What he says isn't just about him and his mom, it's about every kid in the world and every mom in the world. Particularly in America. If kids are watching bad shows or R-rated movies, than it's up to parents to tell them what's right or wrong and decide if the kids should watch these things. Not go so far as to suing or fighting the creators of the bad shows. You can't just shield all bad programs from kids and expect them to all understand it when they're 18. Basically, you need to start small and end big. Show them G-rated programs and Nick Jr. cartoons until about 6 or 7. Then start with PG movies. These movies have very little offensive material, and it starts small so it can build up to PG-13. Kids will ask what does 'damn' mean or why did they hit each other and you, as parents, explain. Then they understand what they mean and whether they are good or bad. Then, around 10 or 11 you can start with PG-13, with a lot more subjectional material. Slowly, they begin to build with what they feel is right or wrong and understanding it all. And then when they can start watching R-rated movies, they are all different, so pick certain ones and build from there (however, the South Park movie, Team America, and similar movies can wait till the end). Then, when they are 18, they will know what their parents consider wrong and right and can build their own opinions on wrong and right and decide how they want it to be in their own adult lives.Whew. Now...3 Humor. This movie is a comedy. If you can't laugh at it, then you have a very low sense of humor. But you are entitled to your opinion. But leave us fans alone. I've heard the complainers say they don't like it because of the excessive language. That is the whole point of the movie, der! To prove that language doesn't hurt us, they are just words. And if it's because it's annoying, then just ignore it. I personally didn't find the excessive language annoying, and I don't know why it can be annoying when it's used in perfect situations in this movie! Anyway, if you don't like this movie, stop wasting your time bitching about it.So, in conclusion, this is just a movie. Don't take it seriously, and just treat it like it is. It's meant for you to have a fun time, and if you didn't then that's too bad. If you did, then that's what the creators wanted. I give this movie a 10\/10.

Who cares every other word is the 'f' word or the 's' word? This movie is about three things 1, to stand up for censorship and the fact that we shouldn't take so seriously. 2, to show parents that they need to worry more about what their kids know and learn rather then worry about what they're watching. And, 3, to LAUGH and HAVE A GOOD TIME! 1 Censorship has it's ups and it's downs. It's ups are that people are comfortable with watching censored shows so they won't get offended. It's downs are when it is taken to far and people go too far with it trying to blame everybody and everything...everyone except themselves. That is what is shown that is wrong with our country. We see something as insignificant as this, and if given the chance, we would seriously start a war rather than take the blame. We've gone into a world where America is never wrong, when in fact, it has about a million more things wrong with it than it does right. Also, this movie deals with censorship in language more than anything else (that's why it swears so much, so people can realize that 'hey, these are just WORDS. Words don't hurt!') Because that's exactly it. Words don't hurt. But violence and some graphic sensuality is seen on TV all the time. Recently, I saw a movie on TV that was edited down, so we didn't hear the 'f' or 's' word, but we still saw a guy's head being cut off. That's right, a guy's HEAD being CUT OFF. Uncensored. But thank God our kids didn't hear the bad words.

If Lucas just stuck to shoot em'up battles etc. it might be passable, but he feels the need to linger on slushy love scenes devoid of any chemistry or personality. The originals seemed epic because they worked on every level, from massive battles right down to individual characters, it was all believable. Even the Imperial officers were convincing.In addition to this the entire picture is utterly devoid of any drama and is forced to rely on stupid gimmicks, such as turning Yoda in to some kind of goblin on amphetamines, to retain the audiences attention. There clearly is a particular breed of moron that found this scene enjoyable, but everyone in the cinema I was at just cracked up!Any serious fan of the originals who tapped in to a few of their subtleties, would have enjoyed the wisdom and HUMILITY of the original Yoda character. That's why seeing so many people praising this forgettable and bland film ultimately degrades not only the Star Wars fans, but also the original films themselves. To anyone sincerely claiming to like this film YOU OBVIOUSLY NEVER GOT THE ORIGINALS AND CAN'T CLAIM TO BE A FAN And as for the sycophants I don't know how much they're paying you but PLEASE, if you've got a braincell in your heads, stop doing it for all our sakes.And what passes for a final battle scene is in fact just like something off your play station, except the graphics are worse and more tacky looking.Let me emphasise NO adult human being with an I.Q above that of some primordial slime, could, in all sincerity, give this film 10\/10.

I saw this one before the first because I was a fan of James Cameron and Michael Biehn. You don't really need to see the first film but some things may make more sense if you do! Alien was very much a suspenseful horror film whereas Aliens is going more for the action. If you've seen other James Cameron films then you should know what to expect. It isn't very gory and does have a few scares in it. The script is good with some cracking lines like 'Get away from her you bitch!' and the acting is the best from all of the films. Unlike the other 3 Alien films I feel that you care more about the characters in this one because the performances are much more three-dimensional. Sigourney Weaver gives her best performance as the maternal Ripley as she battles the aliens to protect her surrogate child, Newt. Her Oscar nomination was well deserved. Michael Biehn makes a great hero that you really cheer on and Lance Henriksen appears shifty but is very innocent as the android Bishop. However, my favourite character is the cocky marine Hudson played by Bill Paxton. I know that he isn't a popular character and I even wanted him to die the first time I saw it but he really grows on you. He's the most realistic of the characters.The director is perfect as usual from a master of the action genre. It is darkly lit so a lot of it is left to your imagination and the trackers really build up the tension. Some of the shots are brilliant like when the aliens are moving through the ceiling.I highly recommend this film to anyone who is a fan of the sci-fi\/action genre and of James Cameron.

This is an actor's movie, and as such is very mannered and has very actorly performances. Not big Oscar moments, but this-is-my-scene-dammit ones. That said, the actors are all very good, especially Tom Wilkinson, who's character never seems sure how to express what he is feeling.Personally, I liked William Mapother's performance the most. It was the one performance that seemed lived in, and Mapother was able, in only a couple of scenes, to suggest, by simple physicality, the history of his character. He's a loser who peaked in High School, has a goofy young man's hair cut and dye job, walks with his chest stuck out, and is angry at a world that he feels owes him something. At the same time, he loves his family, but is pushed over the edge when his wife takes up with the sort of thing that will always get to a guy like him a young college kid from a good family. The scene after he kills Frank and sits down at the table, absolutely stunned at what he did, was, to me, the most striking shot in the film here's a guy who has taken life as it comes to him, and the awful crime he commits is no different, he doesn't plan on killing anybody, he just does it, and tries to weasel out of it, the same way he tried to weasel his way back into his ex-wife's life, and succeeded, if briefly.After watching the movie I thought the end was strange, in the way that Mapother's character seems so disinterested in making his case. He seems passive, feeble. But it was excellent-a guy like that won't try to run away, or fight, he's basically a coward in the end. When he's shot, he just falls down, as if he knew it was coming, but had convinced himself it wouldn't. I see that Mapother is Tom Cruise's cousin, and has only been really seriously acting for a few years now, he certainly has more charisma that his cousin, and I hope that he can land himself some good meaty roles in the future, since he has the perfect face to be a sort of twisted, everyman character actor.

This is an actor's movie, and as such is very mannered and has very actorly performances. Not big Oscar moments, but this-is-my-scene-dammit ones. That said, the actors are all very good, especially Tom Wilkinson, who's character never seems sure how to express what he is feeling.Personally, I liked William Mapother's performance the most. It was the one performance that seemed lived in, and Mapother was able, in only a couple of scenes, to suggest, by simple physicality, the history of his character. He's a loser who peaked in High School, has a goofy young man's hair cut and dye job, walks with his chest stuck out, and is angry at a world that he feels owes him something.

It might just be my defense of Robert Altman, but I think that this is a good comedy. Dr. T who devotes his life to taking care of women, but never considers how they could take care of themselves. He loves everything about women, and women love him. However, nothing he can do can protect them in the end.The problem is that this film was presented as a movie for women a date movie that you can drag a boyfriend or husband to in order to prove love and devotion. The film is actually examining women, their needs and relationships with or without a strong male figure. This isn't a chick flick; it's an analytic comedy. So, the intended movie date turns out to be a disappointment for both parties who have no idea what to expect.The only positive aspect of this whole misunderstanding is that now, years later, Dr. T ends up on the cheap rack at any DVD store. So don't rent it, buy it, give it another look and even if you don't like it, sell it for even cheaper. When this movie is available for less than a dollar, no one will have any excuse not to watch it. Several of the people will end up actually liking it.

The story essentially follows the last years of Mozart's young life, and his on again \/ off again feud with a rival composer, Salieri. Through the composition of several operas, including Figaro and the Death March, Mozart realizes that ambition can sometimes overwhelm the soul.F. Murray Abraham as Salieri and Tom Hulce as Mozart! Both are brilliant here, both deserved the academy award, but only Abraham got it. I DO like Hulce better. He's just simply amazing here. He really hasn't done anything since that closely resembles his performance here. The rest of the cast is great, including a real scene-stealer role from Jeffery Jones. He was known for his silly comedies, and this role was great to exposing audiences to another side of himself. (Oh, I could say something else here, but that would be too obvious).The costuming, decor and time period staging is done just so, but what really gets me, that this is one of the very few movies I've seen taking place in this time period that has a sense of humor about itself. I mean everyone doesn't seem to walking with a ruler down their backside, and it totally looks that living in this time period would have been, you know, fun!
