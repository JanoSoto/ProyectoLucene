[{"date":"1 September 2010","score":"","review":" I think you just have gotta find something you love to do, and then do it for the rest of your life. For me, it's going to Rushmore.Rushmore feels slightly different from Wes Anderson's other movies. It still has his trademark style, dialogue, and memorable characters, certainly. But there isn't as much of his normal focus on visually interesting sets, and the characters feel more lovable. Their flaws aren't as self-destructive as the characters in The Royal Tenenbaums or The Darjeeling Limited. Young Max (Jason Schwartzman, cleverly handling a character who somehow manages to be both an underachiever AND an overachiever), his chosen infatuation, Miss Cross (Olivia Williams), and his disaffected older friend Mr. Blume (Bill Murray) aren't perfect, but Anderson chooses to make them less quirky than is his usual habit. It's an interesting decision which changes the tone of the movie somewhat, but if you like most of Anderson's other work, this will probably be right up your alley, too. It's an endearing little movie about life and finding what makes it all worth it for you, and I enjoyed it.  ","genre":null},{"date":"1 September 2010","score":"","review":" I think you just have gotta find something you love to do, and then do it for the rest of your life.
