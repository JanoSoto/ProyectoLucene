I did enjoy it, and I ignore reviewers who say it is boring, bleak, overrated and stupid. However, I do think it is a bit overrated. Seeing that a film critic named it the best gangster film since the Godfather is a bit disappointing, because I've seen much better gangster films since the Godfather, including the Godfather part II (or does that reviewer find part II not a sequel, but a chapter of a story like I myself do).  Overall, of course Road To Perdition had flaws, but it had some very good acting talent, which definitely crosses off bleak from its list of wrongs. I'm not sure if my first pick would be Tom Hanks for this film, but he worked, just like his character in Saving Private Ryan did as well. Perhaps Mr. Hanks is just trying to prove he is a versatile actor.   Paul Newman didn't have a big part in this film, but he was in it more than I had heard from some haters of the film. The scenes Mr. Newman is in are interesting, though not his best performance at all. Stanley Tucci had a small part, and it's always nice to see his face. He is a good supporting actor, and I'm glad he got the part.

They had commercials featuring him pretending to be a spy and it was only a matter of time before he took the mantel of the super spy. The studio, however, did not foresee having difficulties getting Bronson out of his current contract for the television show, Remington Steele, so they quickly found another Bond, Timothy Dalton. Had they simply waited another year they could have used their first choice as Remington Steele's last season was the same year this film came out. I am kind of glad they did go with someone else though and I just wish they saw what they had with Timothy Dalton as he was a much better Bond in retrospect than was Bronson. Unfortunately, the studio was still apparently infatuated with Bronson, so while this Bond film did rather well at the box office the next film with virtually no advertising and inserted in at the theaters in the middle of the summer of 89, a year of blockbusters aplenty would underperformed and they would pluck Dalton out of the role despite the fact his two Bond films are very good. I like this one the best of the two as it is one of my favorite Bond movies and better than Moore's last two outings. It would also perform better at the box office than Moore's previous outing.The story has someone killing a 00 agent at the beginning. Bond has to help another agent with the defection of a high ranking Soviet official and is charged with assassinating another Soviet official who is said to have gone rogue. The person who defects is recaptured, seemingly by the KGB and Bond must figure out what is going on, because all is not as it seems. His instincts leads him to a lady who plays the cello and at first looked like a sniper, but as Bond earns the lady's trust he soon finds out that the defector may have had ulterior motives as he is connected with an arms dealer named Brad Whitaker.The action in this film is great and it features some cool gadgets as well. They never went as overboard on the gadgets and plot as they would with the Bronson films which is the reason we now have Bond movies with virtually no cool gadgets! Dalton is great as Bond, he for some reason gets this knock as being a super serious Bond, but he pulls off jokes quite nicely and when he and Maryam are doing their scenes together his smile is the most genuine I have seen from a Bond actor. I think the super seriousness stuff stems from his second film, License to Kill where he was a bit darker, but that was a film where Bond was trying to get revenge, plain and simple. Joe Don Baker is pretty good as the villain of the piece, he is not in the film all that much, but I always say the smaller the role the better from him.So this film was fast and fun and a very good Bond film. Seems Dalton was the choice to be Bond like forever as he was even considered as early as the 60's, I had no idea he was that old, but the studios wanted Bronson more. I am guessing Dalton was someone else's choice so they got their way, but then the studio kind of torpedoed Dalton so they could get theirs. It is a shame, I wouldn't have minded seeing a few more Dalton 007 films as they were certainly a more realistic type.

I will stand right up and admit to not being a Chuck Norris fan; I think he is a fine fighter but pathetic actor at best, and anyone looking to a Chuck Norris vehicle for credible performances, complex and dimensional characters and a plausible plot are totally wasting their time. We watch Chuck Norris films to see him kick arse, and on that level of consideration I can see how this film would be a disappointment for his fans -- there are only two fight scenes in the film. Norris fans have a skull cracking quota Silent Rage falls woefully short on that scale and they will probably not enjoy sitting through it. Too bad for them.I happened upon this film when it was on a late night local creature-feature 2am movie slot when I was about 17 and returning from a mind altering excursion to Neverland; granted that with impaired or heightened senses any film would leave an impression on the viewer, but what struck me the most about the movie was how at odds it was with Norris' persona, and had an agenda that was unrelated to what viewers of his films expect; I actually liked it. The effect of having an unstoppable killing machine who utters only grunts and peers oddly at his victims as he shuffles across the ground towards them is also strangely unsettling. The memory of this unspeaking murder machine stuck with me long after forgetting about Norris and what he had to do with the story.As other readers have pointed out, it is the John Libby character that really makes this film, because he is such a total unknown and one dimensional void of psychotic behavior. Upon acquiring a tape of this film as an adult I am struck by the banality of the opening sequence where we first see Libby go over the edge, and am intrigued by just what he had experienced that pushed him into insanity. The image of Libby trying to open his medication bottle, while the noise and clamour around him becomes unbearable, is quite an interesting portrait of pathos; one can almost understand why he decides it is time to go get an ax and shut that woman up once and for all.It is unfortunate that the scriptors did not avail themselves of the opportunity to delve more into the source of his madness scarred Vietnam vet? former abused child? we see memorabilia tacked up on the wall of his room i.e. Travis Bickle but never get a good look at it, and instead indulged themselves in unending, pathetic fat guy jokes with Stephen Furst, who I look upon as the film's major drawback. His character is simply a stupid, obese fat guy who is supposed to be looked upon as funny *because* he is fat. That we know just by looking at him for 5 seconds -- hearing the story about his pet dog or seeing him ape Robert DeNiro isn't funny, it's just pathetic.Equally pathetic, and the source of much more humor for me, are Chuck Norris' speaking scenes. The romance subplot is utterly ridiculous, complete with a disco music accompanied lovemaking scene; Check out the obligatory strewn clothing leading to the bed shot and you'll see items like a wrist excersizer and nunchucks amongst the tangled underwear. Nothing like some wrist exercises to put a woman in the mood, I guess. Norris' dialogue is delivered in stacatto statements -- he doesn't talk with the characters, he recites four or five word sentences while facing in their direction. He also looks uncomfortable when speaking, as though his pants were too tight and needed to take a leak or something like that.Much praise is heaped upon the Road House scene, and I will admit a certain guilty pleasure in watching Norris wipe up the floor with the biker scum. To a certain extent this scene functions as a kind of early Reagan era display of the establishment cleaning up the refuse that had been allowed to fester in America during the latter 1970's. Norris plays the role of lone wolf lawman as well as anyone, and there is an undeniable truth in stating that he comes off best when keeping his yap shut and allowing his feet, fists and broken pool cues to do the talking. It is actually one of the best self contained fight scenes I've ever watched, but one thing about it sort of underscores the ridiculousness of it all; At the end, Chuck's shirt is as neatly tucked into his tight cowboy jeans as it was before he fists started flying. Those karate suits are loose and baggy for a reason -- you don't execute flying kicks very well while your LL Bean shirt is tucked nicely into your ultra tight jeans.The ending showdown with Libby is equally preposterous featuring a little homage to Raiders of the Lost Ark, but provides the film with an ending that suits it's offbeat nature. Having a kung fu fight at the climax of a Frankenstein movie is about as fitting as having Dirty Harry take to the disco floor for a dancing showdown with John Travolta. And having a Chuck Norris film end in a fight to the death against a Frankenstein monster is equally preposterous, yet it provides a workable ending to the film that suggests a sequel, which was wisely never made. In the same way that our imaginations have to suggest what drove Libby insane, we have to imagine him slowly scuttling up the sides of the well to continue on his kill fest, and what we might think up is far more effective than anything that could have been filmed. Leave him down there, I say.As far as the movieness of Silent Rage, I actually like the low budget early 80's exploito-horror feel, complete with the ominous synthesizer music score that is on par with Ennio Morriocone's music for The Thing, also made in 1982. Libby's opening single take freak out sequence is actually very cleverly shot kudos to the film student reader who pointed that out; very Scorcese-esque, and love that long underground corridor in the Research Center with its BIOHAZARD signs. I also appreciate the cheap color stock used during filming, suffusing certain scenes with a kind of ambient green flourescent tinting the result of not using the right lights for the stock when shooting; oops that helps to underscore the nightmarish aspect of the story. The movie has interesting use of color scemes and light\/dark contrasts. I also admire how Silent Rage looks like it was made on the cheap, but doesn't try to disguise it for a second -- dig those police uniforms, consisting of a light blue work shirt over a pair of tan chino pants with whateve boots you have handy and tin stars that look like they came out of a box of Cracker Jacks. The film doesn't try to disguise it's low rent and lurid nature for a second.So what I see here in the end is an interesting, intriguing and ultimately satisfying little sci fi shocker that just happens to feature Chuck Norris and his karate skills in the hero role.

I will stand right up and admit to not being a Chuck Norris fan; I think he is a fine fighter but pathetic actor at best, and anyone looking to a Chuck Norris vehicle for credible performances, complex and dimensional characters and a plausible plot are totally wasting their time. We watch Chuck Norris films to see him kick arse, and on that level of consideration I can see how this film would be a disappointment for his fans -- there are only two fight scenes in the film. Norris fans have a skull cracking quota Silent Rage falls woefully short on that scale and they will probably not enjoy sitting through it. Too bad for them.I happened upon this film when it was on a late night local creature-feature 2am movie slot when I was about 17 and returning from a mind altering excursion to Neverland; granted that with impaired or heightened senses any film would leave an impression on the viewer, but what struck me the most about the movie was how at odds it was with Norris' persona, and had an agenda that was unrelated to what viewers of his films expect; I actually liked it. The effect of having an unstoppable killing machine who utters only grunts and peers oddly at his victims as he shuffles across the ground towards them is also strangely unsettling. The memory of this unspeaking murder machine stuck with me long after forgetting about Norris and what he had to do with the story.As other readers have pointed out, it is the John Libby character that really makes this film, because he is such a total unknown and one dimensional void of psychotic behavior. Upon acquiring a tape of this film as an adult I am struck by the banality of the opening sequence where we first see Libby go over the edge, and am intrigued by just what he had experienced that pushed him into insanity. The image of Libby trying to open his medication bottle, while the noise and clamour around him becomes unbearable, is quite an interesting portrait of pathos; one can almost understand why he decides it is time to go get an ax and shut that woman up once and for all.It is unfortunate that the scriptors did not avail themselves of the opportunity to delve more into the source of his madness scarred Vietnam vet? former abused child? we see memorabilia tacked up on the wall of his room i.e. Travis Bickle but never get a good look at it, and instead indulged themselves in unending, pathetic fat guy jokes with Stephen Furst, who I look upon as the film's major drawback. His character is simply a stupid, obese fat guy who is supposed to be looked upon as funny *because* he is fat. That we know just by looking at him for 5 seconds -- hearing the story about his pet dog or seeing him ape Robert DeNiro isn't funny, it's just pathetic.Equally pathetic, and the source of much more humor for me, are Chuck Norris' speaking scenes. The romance subplot is utterly ridiculous, complete with a disco music accompanied lovemaking scene; Check out the obligatory strewn clothing leading to the bed shot and you'll see items like a wrist excersizer and nunchucks amongst the tangled underwear. Nothing like some wrist exercises to put a woman in the mood, I guess.

But the change is not what you may expect. Instead of unfolding like you are lead to believe instead of making Carolyn see the light and be reborn into goodness by Pumpkins existence her life is flipped upside down and she is even driven as far as to commit suicide. The description on the back of the case referred to this film as a touching love story and a hysterical comedy, but I didn't not see either happen in the two hours this film ran. There is nothing remotely touching or even romantic about this film nor is there one laugh to be had from start to finish. This is because the film walks a very thin line between what is considered touching and what is considered downright mean. See this film is cruel and discriminatory and comes nothing close to laughs or tears. The simple fact is that the entire thing is done backwards. The things that are supposed to be amusing are placed within serious scenes that should have otherwise been moving but come off more as offensive because you are not sure if the scene is serious or not. The langue herein is totally inaproperate and actually made me feel rather uncomfortable with viewing this film. It seems like the script thinks that maybe it can make everyone see the point by having all the characters say the word retard over and over again. This brings me to my next analogy. What the hell was the point of this film? A girl with a happy way of living has her life almost totally ruined in an instant and not on thing that happens in this film makes any sense or is in the least bit believable. A film like this should be telling us to look beneath the surface and see people for their inner beauty because after all isn't it that inner beauty that we fall in love with for in the first place? This film almost seems like it is telling us to avoid helping the disabled because they are looked down on as humans. Is that the kind of message we want to be giving out in this day and age? There are only about five scenes in the entire film that deal with the feelings between Pumpkin and Carolyn, the rest is dedicated to stuck up people who don't seem to have a clue of what is going on around them. Sometimes when a film has a terrible story the acting can at least have a little bit of redeeming quality, not the case here. The acting in this film is dreadful, think what you would get if you crossed a lame soap opera with an after school special from the early 80's and you can probably get a good idea of what the acting is like. But the actors are only half the problem, the rest of the fault goes to the terrible script witch is so meaningless it feels like you are driving your car, full speed, down a one way street that ends with a brick wall. Not to mention all the characters are one dimensional and bland beyond belief. We have a leading lady who seems to be living a plastic existence, her mother who thinks the world revolves around her, a boyfriend who thinks he can survive on looks, an overbearing mother who won't let her disabled son grow up and a rude poetry teacher who serves no purpose here but to swear at his students and say rude things and the saddest part of it all is that it is this teacher who has the only meaningful lines in the film. This film also has one of the worst soundtracks I have heard in a long while, the music just drones on and ruins every scene it is in. In the end this film has nothing good or important to say and it has a total of two effective scene, both being mediocre at best. One when Carolyn returns to the beach after forgetting Pumpkin there and another when she sneaks into Pumpkin's room through his window after his mother forbids him from seeing her anymore.

The thing about this film that makes Jackson such a genius is that even though there is not a human in sight he still manages to have a more diverse cast than any film could dream of having and even though there is not one thing that happens in this film that should be taken seriously I felt myself becoming more attached to these puppets than most human actors. The film opens with a song and dance number that sums everything up Meet the Feebles, Meet the Feebles, we're not your average people They may not be average but all exhibit very human like behaviour that most people would probably not associate with puppets. Just in case you have not figured it out yet this film is not your average Muppet spin-off and should, under no circumstances be viewed by children, or most adults for that matter, anyone who thought Death to Smoochy was offensive better watch out because this film makes that looks like a Sunday matinee. We see a Hippo with a machine gun, a rat who directs porno, a warthog who sells cocaine, a rabbit who came down with HIV. from not using protection while having a threesome and a seal who receives oral sex from a rat who dresses like she is straight off the nearest corner, and all of it is nothing short of hilarious. There are many funny scenes to be had but one of the more enjoyable are of a burnt out lizard remembering his days in Vietnam, there is even a parody of the Russian roulette scenes from the Deer Hunter. The story behind the film is simple, it is one day in which all the performers must practice for a live broadcast of The Fabulous Feebles Variety Hour, but everything seems to be going wrong. Even though there is basically no plot to be found it is still pretty darn fun watching these puppets up to no good, getting into all kinds or hilarious and disgusting situations. All you hardcore Jackson fans fear not there are still plenty of liquids flying around including blood, vomit, urine, semen and puss. Jackson could have taken a satirical approach to this film and in some ways he did, but overall anything smart is thrown out the window in the name of good fun, and good fun it is. So instead he made a film that would please the fans of his other sick and twisted efforts such as Bad Taste and Dead\/Alive. It is sad that we will probably never see films like this again since Jackson has sold his soul for mainstream success with Lord of the Rings, but nevertheless this is an underrated classic and if you have a sick sense of humour like me be sure to check this out because it is indeed one of a kind.

Although George Lucas' movies are good in their own right (except for the juvenile elements he puts in to sell toys to finance the franchise), his scripts (which borrow heavily from J.R.R.Tolkien, mythology & religion) can't compare with the brilliance of the literary trilogy `The Lord of the Rings'.  Granted, Lucas took on a herculean task in writing & directing his story himself, but Tolkien's words, along with Peter Jackson's faithful adaptation & inspired vision, have created something no one man could equal. Of course, it helps that Jackson insisted on at least a 2 picture deal, & New Line Cinema was brave enough to foot the bill up front for 3 movies. They spent $180 million to film all 3 simultaneously.  With the New Zealand exchange rate, that equals $360 million ($90 million ea.), but since they used many of the same sets, and FX development costs were spread throughout, we're seeing $120-$150 million on the screen.  This will ensure consistency in plot, casting, tone, etc.In 3 hours, Jackson has crammed everything essential from the first novel & then some into the film, rewriting some scenes & dialogue with lesser characters for the leads, leaving out only what there wasn't enough time for.  Basically, you have two 90 min. movies running back to back.  There are no slow spots, just one climax after another.  From the opening 10 min. backstory where the Dark Lord Sauron is shown on the battlefield wiping out men & elves 10 at a time with each swing of his mace, I was blown away.  The romance between Aragorn, king in exile, and Arwen, daughter of the elf-lord, is played up for the Titanic quotient, but it's well done. The story, sets, costumes & FX are so rich, you'll have to see the film several times to absorb everything.  The unspoiled New Zealand locales are spectacular, providing a variety of environments to represent the different settings on the characters' journey.  The location sets are imaginative, detailed & weathered, adding to their believability, while the studio sets match them in meticulousness.  The costumes are at once familiar & strange, drawing on both the medievil & the fantastic, but more important, they're also functional & practical.  The music by Howard Shore is appropriately sweeping, Celtic & folky in keeping with the novel, although it lacks the memorable themes of John Williams or Jerry Goldsmith, but neither would commit a year or more to a 3 picture project.  The FX are as they should be, unobtrusive & unnoticed most of the time, there only to support the story not draw attention away from it as in most Hollywood movies which try to coverup illogical plots & bad acting. I'm particularly gratified by the casting of Viggo Mortenson as Aragorn which was a last minute stroke of luck when the actor first chosen for the part backed out due to differences with the director.  I've always thought Mortenson had an intensity & striking but not pretty-boy looks that could portray a flawed, dangerous hero instead of the villains Hollywood always picked him for.A stellar cast giving some of their best performances, visuals that deliver beyond what I imagined, a perfect mix of humor, passion & tragedy, and a feeling of grandeur, scope & impending doom.  Perhaps as an ensemble piece with so many characters & the inability to concentrate on any one, it can't be measured against some of the classic character study films, but even the casual moviegoer can grasp the ideas & not get lost  As far as I'm concerned, it's one of the greatest films of all time.

Robert Heinlein's book has numerous flaws that make it, not slow or dull, but half-baked.  It's often talky, going on at length about military red tape, political theory (especially the rationalizations of the only vets can vote idea that's kept this book much-discussed since 1959), and descriptions of Johnnie Rico's arduous efforts to become, first a soldier, then an officer. The book is also underplotted, with characters like Carmen and Carl simply mentioned from time to time, while playing no real part in the story. The film tightens up the plotline while maintaining its structure like the book, it begins with an action sequence.  The novel's hit-and-run raid on an inconsequential alien planet becomes, in the movie, a disastrous raid on the bug homeworld of Klendathu.  Book and movie both then drop back in time to the point when Johnnie, Carl and Carmen join the Mobile Infantry, then follow their careers through the escalating Bug War.  Important characters Sgt. Zim and Lt. Rasczak are both in the film, the latter composited with Mr. DuBois, Johnnie's school teacher in the book.  But the movie brings both Carmen and Carl into much greater significance to the story.  Dizzy Flores, a minor character bumped off in the novel's first chapter, is given a sex change and an expanded role as a soldierette with a crush on Johnnie. A handsome flyboy with eyes for Carmen is created from scratch for the screen, giving rise to the inevitable wartime romantic triangle. Another major departure from the book has to do with hardware.  Whereas the book's troopers are encased in robotic suits of armor and deployed via individual capsules, the movie's soldiers wear much lighter body armor and are deployed via landing craft.  Why?  I can think of three probable reasons  1)  Encasing the soldiers in exoskeletons and pitting them against bugs would've amounted to a battle between armies of arthropods; the human element would've been greatly diminished.  2)  Similarly, a totally-helmeted cast all look alike. Telling the players apart would've been impossible. And an actor must act, which is much harder to do with his face obscured. For this reason, the knights in movies like Excalibur, Henry V, etc., all doff their helmets just when they need then the most--in jousts or duels or battles--so we the audience can see their faces.  3)  The movie cost 100 million bucks as it was!  The producers were no doubt uninterested in seeing it cost another 100 million.  The movie's cast of mostly unknowns (other than character actor Michael Ironside; Denise Richards has since gone on to greater recognition) was likely an attempt at budget suppression. All told, Starship Troopers is director Paul Verhoeven's triumphant return (after the regrettable Showgirls) to the turf he staked out so well in RoboCop violent, hardware-oriented SF in a futuristic setting, enhanced by Phil Tippett's special effects, scored with Basil  Pouledoris's music, and spiced with dark humor.  Fast-paced and funny, but blood-soaked, so be prepared.

So after J restores K's memory with a `de-neuralizer', together they hunt down the alien scum.  Men In Black II (advertised as MIIB) isn't half as fun or entertaining as the original 1997 film, and falls short on the jokes almost all the time. One must wonder why the writer(s) couldn't have come up with a better excuse for bringing back K other than the cheap gimmick of, `Hey, let's just have a DE-neuralizer to bring his memory back!' I hate when sequels use subjects like that just to bring back a character. `Hey, he's not dead, he was just run over by a tank!' Come on, writers, a little bit more credibility, please?   The jokes in MIIB, as I mentioned, almost all fall flat. There were a few giggles from children during the film, but when I was sitting there, I could tell that almost no one liked what they were seeing, including the children. Have you ever been to a film that is so bad, that people try to laugh at the `jokes' because they are so embarrassed they paid to see `this stupid film'? That's MIIB for you.

It focuses intimately on a rich culture that is unfamiliar to most movie-goers. It's a nearly 3-hour epic, based on a 1000 year-old folk legend.In other words, it's the kind of movie that practically arrives with raves from critics already attached. Usually that kind of hype is worth it, and based on the first paragraph up there, The Fast Runner (Atanarjuat) sounds like a damn good movie. I wish I could hop on the bandwagon with all the other critics, but unfortunately, in spite of all it has going for it, this movie was not very good.The story involves two brothers (one very strong and the other very fast), a love triangle and something about an evil force invading their tribe. I say something, because this whole part of the story is extremely muddled. Or I might have just missed something one of the many times I nearly dozed off.There are good things in the movie. There is strength in the acting, particularly in the performance of Sylvia Ivalu as Atuat, Atanarjuat's first wife. It was also shot in digital video, which gives it a stark, vibrant look and there is some beautiful scenery.But none of this could hide the fact that I was truly bored out of my mind. I like to think of myself as having a very good attention span, but this nearly 3-hour movie truly felt more like 10 hours.It's an important, earnest and honorable movie, and has a few isolated moments of extreme power, but it's not worth slogging through 2 1\/2 hours of utter tedium (and occasional silliness) to see the 20 minutes of good stuff.I can respect this film for what it represents as an accomplishment.

It focuses intimately on a rich culture that is unfamiliar to most movie-goers. It's a nearly 3-hour epic, based on a 1000 year-old folk legend.In other words, it's the kind of movie that practically arrives with raves from critics already attached. Usually that kind of hype is worth it, and based on the first paragraph up there, The Fast Runner (Atanarjuat) sounds like a damn good movie. I wish I could hop on the bandwagon with all the other critics, but unfortunately, in spite of all it has going for it, this movie was not very good.The story involves two brothers (one very strong and the other very fast), a love triangle and something about an evil force invading their tribe. I say something, because this whole part of the story is extremely muddled. Or I might have just missed something one of the many times I nearly dozed off.There are good things in the movie. There is strength in the acting, particularly in the performance of Sylvia Ivalu as Atuat, Atanarjuat's first wife. It was also shot in digital video, which gives it a stark, vibrant look and there is some beautiful scenery.But none of this could hide the fact that I was truly bored out of my mind. I like to think of myself as having a very good attention span, but this nearly 3-hour movie truly felt more like 10 hours.It's an important, earnest and honorable movie, and has a few isolated moments of extreme power, but it's not worth slogging through 2 1\/2 hours of utter tedium (and occasional silliness) to see the 20 minutes of good stuff.I can respect this film for what it represents as an accomplishment.

That movie was a satire of Heavy Metal Rock Stars.  It was funny, and it had at least a few good tunes that were actually written by the actors who played the band.  So, in a way, they were a real band.All I see in this movie is that 12 YEARS LATER, someone decided to try to jump on what was hardly a bandwagon; the success of This Is Spinal Tap hardly created a new genre.This is what I expected when I first rented the film, as I love Punk music, among many other genres.  About 30 minutes into the film, I had to turn it off as I realized that what I rented was exactly what I expected and GOTJust someone trying to jump on the bandwagon or milk someone else's cash cow.And there was nothing to laugh at, either.  I expect Something to keep me at least remotely intrigued to watch more of this.  But, there's nothing.  No jokes, no idiocy, no nothing.Fortunately, I only lost one dollar of my money and half an hour of my time watching this feeble attempt to copy a film from 12 years before it was made.  This feeble attempt is even worse than Mac and Me (feeble rip-off of E.T.), Battle Beyond the Stars (one of the many feeble rip-offs of Star Wars), as well as many others.This is not a satire; this is a Rip-Off of a Satire!!!And a weak one at that.

But, as you can see from the previous comments, this is a movie that you'll either love or hate. But its hard to be indifferent to it. Zwigoff does a wonderful job of setting a mood that allows you to examine an artist who is depraved, perverse and, yet, insightful.Everyone seems to come away from the movie with an idea that Robert is spared the obvious insanity of his two brothers because of his art. But I see it differently(hence the title of this comment). Even Robert admits that his brother, Charles, was a better cartoonist. Another way to view Robert's success and his brothers' descent into crazy is fame. Crumb was an involuntary icon of the 60's. Where would Robert be today if he wasn't recognized and rewarded in the 60's? If Zap comix had turned him away for his misogynist and racist comics, would he have had the subsequent female relationships that seemed to normalize his existence? What would his fantasizing over a high school yearbook and habitual masturbation meant if he was an unknown sharing a room with his brother at Mom's house?When I watch this movie, I am always mindful that Robert's obvious genius would be lost were it not for his luck at being discovered. I suppose that is an obvious statement but, in Crumb's case, fame has managed to gloss over many unacceptable characteristics. And, maybe, that's not such a bad thing.The film lightly touches on Crumb's relationship with his son and daughter. For some reason, Crumb's bumbling attempts at affection with his children were a bit disturbing. Or maybe its just that Crumb's fixation with wrestling and piggyback riding lingers in your mind when he hugs his daughter.On a lighter note, I've noticed that no one has mentioned the soundtrack of this movie. Designed to be in keeping with Robert's love of old American music, the music helps to define the subject. I wonder why Zwigoff made no mention of Crumb's Cheap Suit Serenaders band.Crumb comments against the crass commercialism of America. And, yet, I first saw this movie at a theater in Baltimore where the lobby was chock full of Crumb comic picture cards, mugs, etc.Crumb, the movie, is a crazy world of contradictions and well worth the ride.
