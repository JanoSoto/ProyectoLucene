Which means, oddly enough, it isn't actually *as* bad as you might have heard. It depends on perspective; if you're willing to give in to the 4-score-cheesy humor, which includes Spock being instructed on how to sing campfire songs, James Doohan doing a stupid hit-of-the-head just walking down a hall, and some delicious overacting by many of the cast (including the 'evil' Vulcan Sykbok played by Lawrence Luckinbill), then it might be worth it for some of the oddly interesting ideas regarding belief and allegiance to someone promising a life without fear thanks to God. It might even dawn on someone, as thanks to a note of interest from my girlfriend, that it has more than some allusion to evangelical right wingers.So, trying to put aside political notes, which could go on for so long here that it would be didactic of me, just to note the good news first Shatner, for all of his moments of folly thanks to the crappy special effects (and it's not just the 'God' bits watch for that one little ship speeding by and wonder how far we've come in 20 years with CGI), he's usually a pretty sturdy director of scenes which don't require a lot of action. He keeps a good control over the enterprise crew, and there's even some moments of earned corny-hilarity thrown in here and there like with the rocket-booster shoes. And, yes, there's a not bad *central* plot involving Spock's half-brother, Skybok, who only wants to take people hostage and go to the center of the universe to attain something no one has seen before. I was even slightly moved by a scene where Skybok gives a moment of revelation for McCoy and his dead father.But for all that Shatner might get right as a pure 'Trekkie' fan (and, thankfully, he doesn't make it too much of a vanity project, so no excess close-ups or the like), he also goes too far in other respects. One of the biggest goofs is in the logic that hey, it's Star Trek, we'll need Klingons, just because when they're totally ancillary figures, used only for an awkward, un-funny laugh towards the end where somehow Klingons and Enterprise crew come together following that whopper of a battle between Kirk and whatever-that-God-thing was. And as well, almost in spite of Shatner's skills as a director of certain scenes, there's a slightly dull quality to how some of the story progresses, of the ho-hum-ness of the ship's parts not working, including (GASP) captain's log. Shatner and the writers are obviously digging for something intellectually stimulating as well as going for some stirring drama, but too often they fall short of making it more than just an average episode of the series. Not even Star Trek's first movie in 1979, which had a bloated quality here and there, had the trouble of being just 'average'.If you're into Trek, you'll check it out anyway, and opinions will vary though probably not by much from what I've read. And if you've very limited interest in Trek, it's not a good place to start and might be liable for helping sleepless nights.

I will say right out that the movie is well worth seeing. It is interesting and engaging. The two stars, Kate Winslet and Harvey Keitel are both excellent actors, and they have some challenging material to work with. Some stars are lovely to watch. They radiate a presence that is engaging and enjoyable. Their acting skills may be limited but we always enjoy seeing them. Others are good at their craft, excellent actors who can create a mood and scene and a believability that draws you into the film. Then there are a few that have both the charisma and the skill. When that happens they can take just about any script and make it interesting. Both these actors are in that category.As you may have guessed the problem with the film is the script. Not so much the actual dialog, which is good, but the plotting and character development. Due to the skill of the stars you may not even notice flaws, but then again you might. It may be that the writer\/director simply took on more than she could handle. Although it would have been a bit dull and predictable, the movie would have worked quite well as a simple movie about deprogramming a girl who got taken up in a cult in India. However, the writer\/director wanted to go beyond that. We all have our addictions. Sometimes it's a substance but more often it is an emotion, or a certain kind of thrill, self pity, a desire for power and dominance. I call these kind of addictions character addictions. We all have darker things in our soul that we try to wrestle with. Deep seated desires and flaws. When people get caught up in a cult or a substance addiction it is usually an effort to handle or exploit these character addictions and character flaws. In the film the writer director attempts to explore this darker side of addiction, and in doing so delves into the emotions, desires and drives that we all have which we desperately try to manage and cover up. What starts out as a Macho American trying to deprogram a sexy but foolish Australian girl turns into a soul searching, and at times terrifying exploration of the darker side of both of these people.Oh, if only Jane Campion, the writer\/director, had been able to pull it off. However, she doesn't. As the characters descend into their darker thoughts and emotions the steps are abrupt and unconvincing. Kate seems to go from having some doubts, to grief, to insanity and voracious sexual desire - all in a flash with no real convincing turning points. Harvey, who knows he stepping into very dangerous territory and has had enough experience not to resist it, suddenly succumbs. We don't really see the reasons for this in his previous behavior.Despite all this and other plotting issues, the movie does work, mainly due to the skill and charisma of the stars. I give Jane Campion a 10 for wanting to go beyond the ordinary, but a 3 for not realizing it was inadequate. The stars get 10's. The supporting cast gets about a 4. They are meant to be comic relief but come off as too silly for real life. The exception is Julie Hamilton as mum. She perfectly plays a deeply loving mother who, if not very bright, has a heart as big as the world, and would do anything, and give anything for her child.Enjoyable, even if it is a bit confused and disturbing; a must see if you like these stars.

Breathless is remarkably pure, undiluted cinema, shot by two people on a shoestring budget. It's also fun to note that three titans of the French New Wave, Melville, Truffuat, and Godard, were all involved in some capacity in this film.Breathless was shot on a hand-held camera by Godard and his cinematographer Raoul Coutard.

A good ole boy from Arkansas, he has seen the real world and knows that it ain't got palm trees along its drives. Nor does he hobnob with the phonies, and he correctly wonders why he isn't thrown out of Hollywood. This brave, albeit highly neurotic, man (who ever heard of a phobia about antiques before??!) has turned to some real folks to film a story about real folks. His greatest inspiration was to use the amazing Lucas Black to pay the young Devins. Despite the fact that Black has the deepest country-style Alabamba accent you could ever find these days (how well I remember it from the days when I used to know fellows like him), and it is a joy to hear (if you have your Alabamba accent decoding machine handy), so that he does not really belong in Texas, the equally brilliant inspiration of using Henry Thomas compensates, as he is a down-home Texan of just the right type. Matt Damon as the lead modifies his previously learned Tennessee accent and brings it slightly to the West, which is an incredible feat for a Bostonian! The performances in this powerful and gripping saga are intense and convincing, and everybody wins. Bruce Dern and Sam Shepard have terrific cameos, and Miriam Colon provides a wonderful performance in a key supporting role. Finally, the story ultimately works because of the superb acting of Penelope Cruz. She is perfectly in her element here as a sizzling Mexican beauty, and the intensity of her passion gives the film the final thing it needed. The dialogue in this film has a wonderful sensitivity to dialect, and there are dozens of touches of phraseology which only a practiced ear could have mastered, - genuine ways of saying things down South which no one from outside the region could possibly know and appreciate. I only wish that more viewers of this film could appreciate just how authentic it really is in terms of the characters, the action, and the dialogue. People these days are all wrapped in bubble-wrap, and have no contact with reality because they live in sanitized suburbs and go to those sterile places called malls (which have destroyed America). Some of the people who have written bad reviews of this film have clearly never met anybody like the people in this film and think the whole thing is made up. It sho' nuff ain't. It may all have died out now (the story is set in 1949), but it was real once, that kind of thing and those kind of folks, and get your heads round that, you spoilt and out of touch softies with your computer games and Ipods. This passionate, desperate story may 'only' be a story, but it is grounded in real types and it says more than any hundred Hollywood movies. It is ironical that Matt Damon, so genuine and moving in his performance here, has been turned into Jason Bourne who has no personality, and that Penelope strayed for a while into the clutches of that arch-phoney of all time, Tom Cruise. He never deserved her! If you want to know about 'the real thing' watch this.

I think a film that can be shared from generation to generation like that qualifies it as a classic.I never saw the original release but saw it as a kid on its re-release to theaters around 1975. I thought it was hilarious then. Yes, it looks a little dated now, but what film that is almost 50 years old doesn't. I think my favorite character was the dog, Charlie. He was just too cute, and the way he could perk his ears up on command. He had as much expression as any of the actors! The special effects for the time were quite good - and garnered a Oscar nomination for special effects. My favorite part as a kid was the flying car. AMP did this 7 years before Chitty Chitty Bang Bang came out in 1968.Fred McMurray is extremely adept as his portrayal of the clichéd absent-minded professor. It would have been easy for the part to come off as an almost cartoon caricature. But he makes it seem realistic and believable. I'm impressed at his range of acting talent - as in his classic film noir Double Indemnity to this lighthearted comedy. I also think Keenan Wynn is very good as loan shark Alonzo Hawk.While my kids enjoyed this when they were small, they would probably consider it lame now as teenagers.
