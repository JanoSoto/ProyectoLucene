I cannot list in detail the number of ways this movie could have been made better, and they are all mind-bogglingly simple and all George Lucas's fault.  Even so, I will try to condense them into a short list.1. Actors\/Casting - I have to give all of the actors credit for this because I know they tried their best, even Jake Lloyd.  The movie did not give me a single reason why I should have cared for any of the characters and I can't explain why I did anyway. I can't count how many times people have told me how much better Haley Joel Osment would have been in the role, and I am almost inclined to agree with them.  Supposedly there's something dark and ominous about the Anakin character that all of the Jedi council can see, after all, he's gonna be Darth Vader, right?  Osment projects that fear which leads to anger which leads to etc., and Lloyd just looks like your run-of-the-mill blond California Cabbage Patch kid.  I'd call Jake Lloyd a terrible actor if it weren't for what the great sci-fi writer Orson Scott Card, who personally knows Lloyd, observed Jake Lloyd's a good actor, and it's a pity you didn't get to see that on-screen, since he had no direction or screenplay.  In the same way, Liam Neeson is a great actor, but you didn't see that onscreen because he had no direction or screenplay.Which brings me to my second fault2. Direction - Let's face it, George Lucas has lost it.  He has gone from the great actors' director he was when he made American Graffiti to a special effects artist gone wildly out of control.  I do give him some credit It takes a lot of deliberate effort to sap all of the energy and life out of Ewan McGregor.3. Screenplay\/Plot - This is the section that really makes me wince, and proves that there is nobody left in Hollywood with the courage to tell George Lucas that he can't write.  I mean, logical inconsistencies aside, this dialogue is simply ridiculous.  If a first-grader were called in as a script consultant, he could most likely have improved this movie. There are a thousand instances of questionable logic in this movie like, why did Queen Amidala reveal herself when she did?  Why did she want to go back to Naboo so badly if it would do no good whatsoever and she would probably just get killed?  Are we supposed to believe that a ten year old is going to have twins with her eventually?  Why is she called a Queen anyway, if Naboo is supposed to be a democracy?  Do the natives of Naboo share one collective brain cell to elect a teenager to run their planet?  And what kind of name is Naboo anyway?Beyond that, it doesn't even make sense in terms of the rest of the established Star Wars universe.  For example, the shields that repelled blaster fire, obviously added so the death count would be lower and they could appeal to the 'family' market.  Why do we not see them in the later episodes, when they seem to be of immeasurable tactical value?As for the so-called 'Phantom Menace' conspiracy, does the initiation into the Jedi knighthood include an IQ curtailment?  Why didn't those clods figure out at once that Palpatine was behind it all along?

People tend to feel strongly about this film.  I can remember that when it came out, a film magazine reviewed it twice, feeling that it had to do so, since its two reviewers had such contrasting opinions. In short, people who don't adore it, tend to hate it.Those who hate it have failed to understand something very important that it is set in the land of dreams.  Excalibur makes no attempt to be realistic.  It is the film of a legend, and it tries to create a world of legend, and it succeeds.  Once one has realised that this is not the real world, then the film is internally consistent and works splendidly. Merlin, towards the end of the film, even says the line Your love brought me back to where you are in the land of dreams.  If anything, this makes the film even more tragic, because all of Arthur's sufferings have been not for his world, but for ours.The Arthurian legend is probably the world's best legend.  It has been told a thousand different ways, but is so strong, that no retelling can harm it. The story is familiar, but this telling of it is not.  The screen starts blank, with the distant drums of Seigfried's Funeral March playing, and after a few captions, the curtain lifts to reveal a stunning opening sequence with horses breathing fire-lit breath into the night air, as Uther's men do battle with those of the Duke of Cornwall.  The armour is dark, and greenish, and the movements slow, making this seem like a scene of battling dinosaurs.  It is brutal and bloody.  These are the dark ages. This is the time of chaos from which Arthur's kingdom must come.  Into the scene, in a cloud of swirling fog, comes a figure who will be present throughout the film, ageless and mysterious, Nicol Williamson's Merlin, whose voice carries over the din.I remember how suddenly I found myself immersed in this world when I first saw the film, and even now the hairs stand up on the back of my neck thinking about it.  Allow yourself to become  involved with the film, and you will be rewarded.The costumes are magnificent.  Special mention must go to the shining armour, and Morgana's (Helen Mirren) ever-increasingly impressive series of outfits.  The music is stirring (it uses O Fortuna from Carima Burana before this had become a cliche).  The acting is theatrical and good. Each of these characters is on a stage, to be examined.  This is not a film of quiet intimate moments.  It is a legend, and legends are public.Excalibur distills the Arthurian legends into one film of watchable length very cleverly.  At several points during it, a clever cut tells the viewer that several years have passed.  Single characters represent many things. At one point Sir Percival represents all the questknights, at another Morgana is all that is evil.  In telling the story quickly, the film uses simple direct speeches.  In one scene, Arthur visits Guinevere, the woman he loved deeply, whom he hasn't seen for many years.  He spends just a minute in her company and leaves, and yet the speech he delivers to her is so complete and so moving, that you do not feel robbed.  He says his piece and leaves, needing to say no more.It is true that the film has dated a little.  Some of the hair-styles and special effects are not quite what they would be today, and the quality of the dubbing is not first-rate, but this is still stunning.  Everything seems to have come together to help this film look and sound good.  The skies over the castles are spectacular, the Irish landscape (it was shot there) looks the part.  The visual imagination and daring to have Camelot as a castle literally made from silver, and to have Arthur's final battle fought in fog with a huge blood red sunset behind it, makes this a feast for the eye.I am writing about one of my all-time favourite films.  I cry every time I see the land burst into blossom as a reborn Arthur gallops through it, and I feel the heavy warmth of tragedy as he is carried off towards the sunset to the Isle of Avalon.

","genre":"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"},{"date":"11 October 1999","score":"","review":"  I've heard a lot of people complain about this movie in many ways and most of them in my opinion need to remember one very important thing about going to see a movie, especially one in a series of movies DO NOT GO TO THE MOVIE WITH A SET OF PREJUDICES\/EXPECTATIONS!!  You will almost always be disappointed since the chance of the movie actually going exactly how you expected it to go are close to nothing.  That is the biggest problem with this movie.  People go expecting to see Luke, Han, Leia, Chewie, etc... and are disappointed when they get to see full-fledge Jedi Knights as the main characters, something we really only got to see a glimpse of in A New Hope with Obi-Wan in his advanced years.  So, these Jedi's aren't like Han & Luke, being more calm and sometimes not as easy to relate to as a result.Also very important to remember is the fact that we are at the beginning here.  We are going to watch how the Evil Empire developed out of the Republic, so of course we don't start out with the Evil Empire.  This is a completely different time and set-up than the other Star Wars movies and should be treated as such.I tried real hard to go into this movie without any pre-determined biases. I didn't read anything about the movie's plot and tried to keep my mind free of guessing the plot, although this was hard.  I must admit that when I first watched this movie I left slightly disappointed, but then the more I thought about it and the more I saw it, the more I liked it.  Of course the best part of the whole movie was the light saber duel which far out-classed anything we had seen beforehand in the other Star Wars movies.  It took me watching the movie several times to just fully grasp the whole duel!The special effects were great, as always, in fact this was the best computer animation I've ever seen.  On that topic, a lot of people also complained about Jar-Jar.  I didn't have that much of a problem with him, treating him what he was.  Also, people had problems with the cultural accents several characters had.  I don't feel this is in any way putting down any cultures, but trying to emphasize that these different races are like our different races.There were a few things I disliked about the movie.

The movie is near flawless in direction, acting, cinematography, pace, writting, charecter development, entertainment value, and accuracy. Kevin Spacey has the performance of his career and yet it is equalled by the brilliant acting of several others most noticably newcomer Wes Bentley and sexy young Thora Birch. The movie portrays suburban America better then anything I've ever seen and manages to be funny, dark, dramatic, violent, and sad. A virtual roller coaster of a movie that flows perfectly between scenes that are on all opposites of the emotional spectrum. The flow from a dinner scene where Kevin Spacey explodes with rage is hilarious smoothly into the next scene of Thora Birch teaching Wes Bentley about beauty thats dramatic, and finally into a violent confrontation between Bentley and his on-screen military father. The filming of it goes hand in hand with the marvelous directing. The theme of each person seeking out what is beautiful to him or her also teaches the drawbacks to finding it. Spacey does a hilarious and convincing stoned seen. And I'll never be able to get the image of him lifting weights and smoking weed out of my head. I'd like to see Kevin Spacey from Se7en argue with Kevin Spacey from this. (Kevin Spacey in Se7en believed that the whole world is ugly and horrible) (Kevin Spacey in this believe there is beauty in everything) They could each have a partner in the argument too. Morgan Freeman for Se7en Sapcey and Wes Bently for American Spacey.There is possibly a bit too much drama in it and I could see how some people would say there's nothing mystical about a bag floating on air, there's no deeper meaning, just as there is no deeper meaning to life or anything else into the universe. To think other wise is to believe in a religon of nature, and would be reading too much into a bag floating on air. This movie is kind of too optimistic. But the movie knows that by telling the veiwer the beauty is in the eye of the beholder, to each his own. I would'nt blame anyone for changing their philosophy on life a little after seeing this. Even though changing your life because of a movie is kind of shallow and self defeating in this case. Director Sam Mendes has a good future if continues to direct like this and continues to get such performances from his actors and actresses. Annette Benning, Mena Suvara, and Chris Cooper make the absolute most out of their roles and do more then an ample job at it. This movie has more charecter depth then any movie I have ever seen. You can see how each charecter is multi faceted, and has a personality, and their basic charecter flaws, and how each charecter percieves the world in more then just one way. Each charecter can be seen to have multiple emotions running through them all at the same time, like in real life. When they are angry they aren't just angry, they are angry and scared and happy and sad all at the same time. With the exception of Wes Bentleys mom who seems to be the creepiest person in movie history. And it's not often I use the word creepy. Plus many small details are paid attention to in the movie. Like the poster in Spacey's garage of the pot leaf and colors. Posters such as that are usually a staple of any free whelling pot smoker. The messy garage with shelves cluttered with junk is a part of suburban Americana. The way Annette Benning treats her couch is how lot of people are about couches, again Kevin Spacey's first scene of being stoned is truly perfect. PERFECT. He must have really smoked weed to get it so perfect. Just as perfect as the stoned performances of Cheech and Chong during the first thirty minutes of Up In Smoke. So accurate it doesn't even seem like acting. My only problem with this movie is where to rank it on my all time best. Because while it does weigh up to such movies as Reservoir Dogs and The Wild Bunch which are at the very top of my list, it doesn't seem to hold a candle to movies like American History X, or Taxi Driver which are a little lower. But all in all it is a breath taking picture worthy of a slew of Oscars and quite possibly could be one of the best peices of cinema since Citizen Kane. As for me I give it a definate 10 out of 10.

There are no such things as mummies coming back to life, so if you're going to insult things for not being factual you might as well insult that too.I'm just trying to say that it's more fun to watch a movie if you don't nitpick at every dumb detail. This movie is nothing more than what most movies are supposed to be. A way to spend 2 hours entertained. We all know special effects are fake,so why don't we accept it and just enjoy them.I have to say that I really enjoyed the performances of the actors in this film. I have to admit that since I didn't see that many previews of the film, and the fact that I am only 18 years old, the reason I went was mainly because of my love for Brendan Fraser's acting,(and body!)I was very pleasantly surprised by the mummy, though. Arnold Vosloo's acting was awesome and all thoughts of Brendan Fraser were kind of put off to the side, for my focus was on Arnold. He is a very sexy actor.He was very convincing as the mummy, and the rest of the cast did their parts very well too, I might add.

He has no control over his life, but is not smart enough to realize it or care.  Gary Sinise co-stars as Lt. Dan Taylor, Gump's ex-C.O. who follows him around after the war like an albatross hung around his neck.It's been five years since I saw this movie, but I still remember how it annoyed me, chiefly by appealing to the basest, most jaded parts of the viewers' personalities.  The worst instance was when Forrest Gump tells the audience that his sweetheart Jenny's father loves her a lot, always hugging and kissing her.  In my theater, a raucous, cynical snicker rippled through the audience at that line; we are intended to conclude from that statement that Jenny's father is sexually abusing her, and Zemeckis later confirms this leap to a sick conclusion.  It is a truly sad commentary both on the entertainment industry and on the viewing public at large that the very concept of fatherhood today is so disrespected that for a father to hug and kiss his daughter is taken per se as a sign of sexual abuse.Jenny's character is so despicable that Gump's love for her is inexplicable. Perhaps it is intended as an example of really unconditional love, and shows what a sorry thing that kind of love is, much like the wife who clings to an abusive husband no matter what he does to her.  Her character hits rock bottom when, having abandoned Gump like a used-up tissue and taken his child from him without even informing him, Jenny refuses even to apologize to him because she was messed up.  Gump swallows this excuse with stomach-turning ease.Now I don't want to launch into some Pat-Robertson-like tirade on the decline of American morality.  American morality is better today than in the past in many ways.  Racial hatred has gone from being an accepted norm to being absolutely intolerable.  Rape is blamed on the victim less frequently than in bygone days.  Sexual double standards are being abandoned. Religious tolerance and inter-faith amity are on the upswing.  But in some other ways, American morality is deteriorating, and this one excuse, I was messed up, is perhaps the best example.  Every kind of barbarism, from Jenny's cruel and heartless manipulation of Gump up to and including cold-blooded murder, is now excused with the phrase I was messed up, followed by an endless litany of the wrongdoer's misfortunes.  FORREST GUMP wantonly tries to widen this tear in the fabric of the viewers' moral thought.  I'm not buying into it.  Being messed up may excuse viciousness against the person who messed you up; it should never be allowed to justify hurting innocent people.The movie's exploitation of the mentally handicapped for cheap laughs is also tasteless and vulgar (and yes, I will shamefacedly admit, I laughed at some of this exploitation).  I may not want a mental deficient like Gump for an airline pilot, but he deserves to be treated with at least basic decency and courtesy, which this movie doesn't; (i.e. where Gump, shaking Richard Nixon's hand, says I gotta pee.  This is funny?).The mitigating, if not the saving, virtue of FORREST GUMP is the acting. Tom Hanks' rendition of a speech impediment might not fool the parent of a mentally retarded child or a speech pathologist, but it certainly convinced me and the average moviegoer.  Hanks generates the innocence and pleasantness required of the character, and while the voice grated on my nerves a few times, it was bearable.  Gary Sinise as Lt. Dan Taylor is absolutely wonderful, oozing bitterness and cynicism from every pore.I also give FORREST GUMP some grudging praise for being one of the few movies to use the wonders of modern digital special effects to actually drive the plot, rather than distract from it.  TITANIC and JURASSIC PARK also broke some ground, but for the most part I think that most directors lack the imagination to get the most out of the potential of modern special effects.  Zemeckis integrates the effects into his movies more smoothly than most directors have.I didn't really hate FORREST GUMP.  It obviously wants to be loved so much that hating it would be like kicking an annoying puppy.  But it's morally obtuse, shallow and vulgar.  The laughs are guilty laughs, and the philosophy is nothing deeper than the credo that God does indeed look after fools.Rating ** out of ****.

This is no first flash in the pan effort from Osment. He has been in films and on stage for five years. He was the young Forrest Gump and also played Avery Brown on Murphy Brown. He had a plum role on Ally McBeal for which he was nominated for an Emmy Award.\tThe third talent would have to be that superb actor Bruce Willis. He again shows that his talents extend far beyond lunging around gun in hand. He years ago played the lead in Sam Shepard's play Fool For Love which ran for five years off Broadway. Consider his almost unrecognisable performance in Die For You and his perplexed cop in The Fifth Element before you write Willis off as some idiot action star. Anyway he was great in Die Hard.\tAnd Australia's Toni Collette (Muriel's Wedding, Lillian's Story, The Pallbearer) nearly made the list for her touching performance as the young boy's mother.\tThe Sixth Sense somehow avoids the mawkishness of the awful Ghost and is miles ahead of The Haunting, the other ghostly film on show now. The essential trick upon which the film is based remained hidden for me, as it will I think for nearly everyone.\tIt isn't horrifying but is a bit spooky and thought provoking.

This is no first flash in the pan effort from Osment. He has been in films and on stage for five years. He was the young Forrest Gump and also played Avery Brown on Murphy Brown. He had a plum role on Ally McBeal for which he was nominated for an Emmy Award.\tThe third talent would have to be that superb actor Bruce Willis. He again shows that his talents extend far beyond lunging around gun in hand. He years ago played the lead in Sam Shepard's play Fool For Love which ran for five years off Broadway. Consider his almost unrecognisable performance in Die For You and his perplexed cop in The Fifth Element before you write Willis off as some idiot action star. Anyway he was great in Die Hard.\tAnd Australia's Toni Collette (Muriel's Wedding, Lillian's Story, The Pallbearer) nearly made the list for her touching performance as the young boy's mother.\tThe Sixth Sense somehow avoids the mawkishness of the awful Ghost and is miles ahead of The Haunting, the other ghostly film on show now.

","genre":"Drama, Mystery, Thriller"},{"date":"11 October 1999","score":"","review":"  At least three terrific talents have combined to produce The Sixth Sense; a film that captures new cinematic ground, at least in the modern era of film. It occupies something of the same surprising, innovative territory The Usual Suspects challenged a few years ago.\tThe Sixth Sense tells the story of an eight year old Philadelphia boy (Haley Joel Osment) who believes he can see dead people. A child psychologist called Malcom Crowe (Bruce Willis) takes the case hoping that he can help the boy.\tIt's a shame that the publicity for the film betrays the boy's secret before we see the film. We aren't told in the film until half way through what is bothering this young fellow. But this would be just about the only criticism I can level at a movie that is a triumph in so many ways, at least for a film from the Hollywood big league.\tAnd the three talents? Well writer\/director N. Night Shyamalan has created an entrancing film which is spooky in the pre-special effects fashion. The Sixth Sense doesn't rely on digital monsters but on much subtler techniques. The half glance, the fleeting shadow and at a push the sudden loud noise are layered upon a cleverly worked script and some very effective, sometimes clever camera technique.\tShyamalan (pronounced SHA-mah-lahn and I gather called Night by his mates) is a 29 year old American of Indian extraction who has been entranced with film since his early years.
