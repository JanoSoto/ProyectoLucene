John Cleese and Charles Crichton have combined forces to create a riotously funny crime comedy about a group of criminals who are filled with bad luck and bad ideas. It takes a little long to establish the characters upon the opening, but I loved how quickly it got to the point with the robbery taking place within the first ten minutes. The laughs didn't really get started for me until twenty or thirty minutes in, but once they did they did not let up. The plot concerns four unique people who team up in England to rob some diamonds and then spend the rest of the film trying to stab each other in the back, get the loot and get away.Jamie Lee Curtis leads the foursome as the minx Wanda Gershwitz, along with Tom Georgeson's Georges Thomason. Coming in on them are the stuttering lackey Ken Pile, played by Michael Palin, and the Nietzsche-reading buffoon Otto, played by Kevin Kline. Thomason gets pinched early on, one of the first of many double-crosses, and so the film concerns itself mostly with Otto and Wanda trying to find the diamonds while making sure that Thomason stays behind bars and doesn't give them up. To do this, Wanda gets herself close to Archie Leach (John Cleese), a lawyer who has been tasked with clearing Thomason's name.A Fish Called Wanda flies around wildly, yet somehow Cleese and Crichton are able to give it this rhythm that flows so well. It never gets too far ahead of itself but it doesn't drag for a single moment either. This is the rare pure comedy that is wickedly funny while also being incredibly intelligent in it's writing and directing. A lot of comedies act as if the audience has a short attention span and so they try to cram as many jokes as possible in the first hour and then leave the audience yawning through the final act. Here though they know that the audience wants to laugh more as times goes on and they spend their time building jokes that will pay off even stronger in the later scenes.There are so many recurring bits, like Otto's blind rage over being called stupid or Ken's inability to murder an old lady, that only get more and more hilarious as they go on. Somehow these jokes never feel like they're hitting the audience over the head or being used too much, but instead just get better and better. The cast is certainly worth noting, as all four of the main characters provide great ingredients for the laughs. Cleese is the perfect straight man for the wild antics of the rest, Curtis is whip smart and an alluring sex kitten, Palin is so damn likable that you just want to make all of his bad luck go away and Kevin Kline steals the show completely.Kline takes on Otto with a skill that is almost unmatched in comedic cinema. This is a guy who is always the stupidest person in the room but always thinks that he is the smartest by far. He puts himself on a pedestal and it could have been a role that was done with disastrous results, but Kline takes his craft so seriously that Otto never feels like he's in on the joke that the audience is. This is an actor who has made a career out of mixing comedy and drama, and here is the highlight of his work in the former field. It takes a little bit to get going, but once it does this is easily one of the most delightfully hilarious films I've ever seen and Kline got me laughing harder than I have with a film in a long while. In Denmark a man died while seeing this film in theaters because he literally laughed himself to death. It's easy to see why.

I have already seen this movie countless times and know most of it by heart already but it can still really make me laugh out loud, every time I see it. You just never grow tired of it! Also when you see this movie for the first time, you'll probably see some of the jokes coming from miles away already but this really doesn't make them any less funny or effective, in any way.There are lots of comedies like this one, that just fire jokes at you, at an almost nonstop rate but it is very rare that at least 90% of those jokes works out as well, as is the case with this movie. A truly great comical achievement, that also can be seen as the father\/mother of all spoofs.I'm not sure that all new and young viewers will get this but this movie is actually being a spoof of the disaster movie genre, which was very popular, mostly during the entire '70's period. There were lots of movies as well, in which planes got in trouble, for all crazy sort of reasons. This movie pretty much follows the same sort of story and characters, only by making fun of it this time, as well as all of its clichés. But even when you won't 'get' this, it really doesn't matter all too much, since the story remains simply an absolute hilarious one.The comedy of the movie is actually quite absurd and you might even call it lame and childish. It's often very simplistic and can be seen as a combination of old fashioned slapstick, lots of visual jokes, comical dialog, crazy characters and a silly nonsense story. It's also the first movie to feature Leslie Nielsen in a comedic role. Quite hard to believe that he once was a serious actor, since he grew out to become the king of spoofs. And let me tell you that he is also absolutely hilarious in his role. But that pretty much goes for every actor in this movie, simply because the material they are given to work with is so great and just spot on.The timing, the buildup, the execution, it provides this movie with more than just a couple of laughs and memorable comedy moments.

Thankfully she runs into Tarzan (Buster Crabbe) who helps on her search as well as helps fight some of the bad people in her group. TARZAN THE FEARLESS is a pretty bad movie that features all sorts of campy moments but I think it remains watchable because it does have a certain charm thanks to its badness. Originally this was meant to be a 12-part serial but sadly that version is now missing. The producer basically took the first four chapters and turned them into this movie so that will explain why things sometimes don't make sense or that the story is jumping all around the place. Without the serial to see exactly what they did, it's hard to say if they improved anything but most of the time these serial chapters to features don't work. There are quite a few campy moments with this film and most of them are Tarzan himself. He has a really silly and annoying howl here that will certainly make you laugh. As with the first MGM film, Tarzan can't speak here so instead of talking to Mary he always breaks into this weird laugh that makes him seem rather slow. It's clear Crabbe was going for a different type of performance because he makes the Tarzan character more of a mentally challenged person than anything else. Bishop is certainly easy on the eyes as the love interest. Philo McCullough was actually good as the main villain and we get Edward Woods playing the good guy. The film is full of stock footage, fights with lions and of course the eye-rolling moment of yet another beauty getting into their bathing suit and going swimming when of course a croc shows up. TARZAN THE FEARLESS is a real mess of a movie but fans of bad cinema should get a few kicks out of it.I will also say that Turner Classic Movies showed a 87-minute version, which I actually found much better than an earlier version running 71-minutes and included on one of those public domain packs.

Well, perhaps all those who did and do so might care to pause a moment or two and ask themselves why the proportion of black and coloured inmates in U.S. jails compared to whites is still higher than the proportion of blacks and coloureds which make up the population of the U.S. They might care to ask themselves why a higher proportion of blacks and coloureds are unemployed, live in poverty and have a far lower standard of education. They might care to ask themselves why, almost 60 years after the hearing of the Amistad case before the Supreme Court the so-called Jim Crow laws were enacted denying blacks anything but equality with whites.But it's just a film, you might be saying, come on, don't be so uptight about it. Well, granted that it's not just the Americans but we Brits and the French, the Germans, the Russians, in fact every nation on earth who regularly chose to rewrite its history in films, novels, plays and poetry the calumny is not isolated or even unusual. We Brits like to bang on about what a civilising influence our glorious empire was and ignore completely the misery its establishment engendered and the huge number of deaths that were thought necessary for it to continue civilising 'savages'. And what after all, you might care to argue, is the 'truth'? One man's truth is another man's folly, perhaps, or one man's open mind is another man's gullibility. Well, I'll gracefully take the point but respond by pointing out the facts I cited above of the comparative freedoms and affluence of blacks and coloureds compared to whites in America.

Why, it might be something to do with the fact that establishment America didn't and doesn't quite rate a black chocolate city like New Orleans has high as rather more top-drawer municipalities (although down-at-heel white communities aren't exactly privileged). And when we talk of 'establishment America', we might add that Hollywood and its filmmakers are one of its essential constituent parts.By all means enjoy Amistad as a film, a piece of fiction, but please don't run away with the idea that despite portraying historical incidents - although one larded with fictional characters Morgan Freeman's dandified citizen is especially offensive, particularly since every other black face in the film is, if not an African from the Amistad, a servant or pauper.

A good case could be made about accompanying some film soundtracks with the notice that 'this soundtrack can adversely influence your judgement'. When a 15-minute scene of a grand American figure such as John Quincy Adams grandly making grandly patriotic observations has a backdrop of such a patriotic melange of flutes, trumpets and strings, you just know something very rum is going on.Giving Amistad a rating presents a real problem as filmmaking it is very fine indeed and Spielberg is a filmmaker almost without peer.

It is slow, elegant and perverse in a very intellectual way, and is also a movie which addresses the intelligent viewer one who immerses himself into the detail of the design and script and, of course, who is expected to use his imagination throughout the viewing.I have shown this film to several of my friends, who were not quite as impressed by it as I was, indeed they yawned and called it boring several times during the very long prologue, so to speak. I was disappointed, but not surprised. Contemporary sci-fi is reduced to a cheap but dynamic story and CGI (of course, there has been a pair of brilliant films in the past ten years, but shoddy is the norm in my opinion). If you are looking for a fast-paced piece with lots of action, this may not be your cup of tea.On my part, I believe that this film comes as close to perfection as possible the only flaws I notice and that occasionally bother me are the effects in some parts, such as the android head and drops of water in the end shot. The volume of the score sometimes seems to be too low for my taste and I believe all of Goldsmith's masterwork should have been used as per his idea. Finally, there is a pair of shots in which I believe a little too much of the Alien has been shown, and I don't really like the way the part of the suit beneath the torso was made. Of course, all of these things are trivial in the big picture, and you probably wouldn't notice them on the first viewing.And why do I think this is the finest work of art in movie history? I have already said that it engages the viewer in a very discrete fashion. The scene on the alien planet alone should leave you puzzled, but no sooner do we start asking ourselves the first row of questions, the next one has emerged, and so on. For the first-time viewer, the most enthralling question is certainly what the creature looks like and what might we see in the next shot, which for me was an original experience.The design is probably the finest point of the film. Ron Cobb designed the human element of the film, whereas the great master Giger outdid himself with the alien vessel and creatures. The environment of the alien vessel is the most foreign looking and curious I have ever seen in a movie, and that is not taking into account the many refined sexual themes. The dichotomy of human (functional, wet, sometimes sterile-looking) and alien (dark, massive, uneconomically large and erotic) is why I enjoy watching this work over and over again.Other reviewers have already mentioned the acting, so I will only mention Ian Holm's performance, which I find to be the finest of the cast. There is relatively little dialogue in the movie, and very laconic at that. This actually allows the atmosphere, score and body-language to come into the foreground - especially in the third act, when the flashing lights, sirens and Mother's voice seem to give an unusually loud and urban tone. The fact that we are aware, as the audience, of this illusion (which somehow comforts the viewer after having witnessed the previous events, and by this time likely being thoroughly horrified) underlines even more aggressively, despite the lights and sounds, the solitude aboard a massive, empty, eerie star freighter.Of course, the ending is shockingly sublime, with the extract from Howard Hanson's Romantic Symphony providing a wonderful respite from the cathartic ordeal (this is, in fact, the only part of Mr. Scott's tampering with the score that I approve of), and you will probably continue watching till the credits end, dwelling on the most powerful theme of the movie the vastness, hostility and unthinkable age of the Universe.

So when I saw that a film version had been made, and wonder of wonders it starred Fierstein, I rushed out to see it. And I was not disappointed.In the interim I had read the play. On the stage, TST was an experimental piece with minimal sets, lots of overlapping dialogue (something that works well on the stage but is hard to do on film), and a running time of nearly four hours. So when I saw that the film's running time was just two hours, I prepared myself for a hack job. But Fierstein himself adapted his own play to the screen; I should have known better. The end result is, you might say, a compressed version of the play Fierstein made a good many judicious cuts in the dialogue, leaving only the choicest bits, and the finished product shines like a well-cut diamond.TST tells the story of ten years in the life of Arnold Beckoff (Fierstein), a female impersonator in New York City with a romantic nature; surrounded by men looking for sex, Arnold is looking for love, and it can be cold out there in the big city.Yet he does find love, and more than once. The first time in the person of a *bisexual* schoolteacher named Ed Reese (winningly played by Brian Kerwin), who ultimately can't make up his mind which bed he wants to sleep in. Ed isn't a bad guy, but he is terrified of being gay and tries desperately to make a life with his girlfriend Laurel (Karen Young in a brilliant, funny-sad performance), in the end succeeding only in hurting both Laurel and Arnold, who drops him.Arnold's next love interest literally falls into his lap. Onstage at the club, Arnold is heckled by a bunch of young men who are very drunk, and one of them, upon being confronted, responds by passing out. Arnold takes him home to sleep it off. The young man, by name Alan Simon, barely out of his teens, is brilliantly played here by the indecently beautiful Matthew Broderick. Looking down at the sleeping boy, Arnold says, If you have an IQ of over 30, then there is no God. When Alan awakens Arnold serves him breakfast, gives him directions to the subway, and locks himself in the bathroom until the kid leaves. But what he does not know is that Alan has developed a huge crush on Arnold, and he pursues him quite openly until Arnold's defenses crumble.Arnold's love life goes on with more than its share of triumphs and tragedies. Running on a parallel track is his relationship with his mother (Anne Bancroft, sensational as always), on the surface your typical New York Jewish Mother who hovers over her kids and has a gift for laying on the guilt. But there is more to her than that. Arnold loves her and is frustrated by her in equal measure; she has never accepted him for who he is and constantly makes references to the mythical *wife* he will *someday* have.Arnold's journey of love and loss and reconciliation climaxes with a final confrontation with his mother in which he finally lays down the law There's nothing I need from anyone except for love and respect and anyone who can't give me those two things has no place in my life!Condensing a four hour play into a two hour movie seems an impossible task, but Fierstein and Company pull it off brilliantly, and the end product is a warm and winning film, often funny and sometimes tragic, but always real. And the best part is that Hollywood did not insist on putting a name star in the lead. The part was written by Fierstein for Fierstein because on some level Arnold IS Harvey, and it's perfect for his rubbery, funny face which reflects every emotion he feels, and while he starts out considering himself somewhat less than attractive, by the end of the film, he has gained considerable dignity and is almost handsome.A joy to watch from start to finish.

Arnold loves her and is frustrated by her in equal measure; she has never accepted him for who he is and constantly makes references to the mythical *wife* he will *someday* have.Arnold's journey of love and loss and reconciliation climaxes with a final confrontation with his mother in which he finally lays down the law There's nothing I need from anyone except for love and respect and anyone who can't give me those two things has no place in my life!Condensing a four hour play into a two hour movie seems an impossible task, but Fierstein and Company pull it off brilliantly, and the end product is a warm and winning film, often funny and sometimes tragic, but always real. And the best part is that Hollywood did not insist on putting a name star in the lead. The part was written by Fierstein for Fierstein because on some level Arnold IS Harvey, and it's perfect for his rubbery, funny face which reflects every emotion he feels, and while he starts out considering himself somewhat less than attractive, by the end of the film, he has gained considerable dignity and is almost handsome.A joy to watch from start to finish.

While this MIGHT sound like a typical schlock horror film from the late 50s or 60s, it's not--and this isn't just because it came out in 1980. This is because the film is VERY bloody and violent and has ample nudity tossed in to boot! And, it turns out the monsters don't just want to kill people--they want to rape all the hot women in town in order to reproduce!! According to IMDb, once the film was completed, the producer wanted MUCH more sex--and the director refused to do this. So, another director was hired to film additional sexy scenes! It certainly won't be mistaken for Beach Blanket Bingo, The Horror of Party Beach or a Disney flick! So is it worth watching? Well, in one way it certainly does. Despite this being a cheapo film, the special effects for the monster attacks are amazing--especially for 1980. The victims look as if they really were attacked by monsters--with heads torn in half and other giant bloody wounds that actually look very realistic. As for the monsters, unfortunately, they are not quite so realistic--and are a bit more like the crappy old monster film sorts of creatures than you might be expecting. It's obvious that they spent money in some places and made some significant cutbacks in others. Also, the acting isn't bad--and the film sports a few B-list actors with significant film credits behind them (Doug McClure and Vic Morrow). As for the rest of the film, it's probably not most folks' cup of tea--and is certainly NOT a film to show grandma or the kids!! These are very, very horny monsters and the movie is a bit like a horror film merged with soft-core porn. Now if you are into this sort of thing, it's reasonably well made but also beware that it is NOT a 'nice' horror film. Certain unwritten rules are clearly violated when the film begins--as a little kid is killed and soon lots of dogs are torn to pieces! Also, the nudity isn't exactly very sexy--so if you are looking for a lot of skin, you should look further. Overall, a semi-competent film that is entertaining in a very low-brow way. Not terrible but not especially good either.

With this affliction he tries to find the killer of his wife to inflict revenge. The way the film plays out is quite brilliant. It has little pattern yet it is so watchable simply because all the time you are trying to work out what it going. It is like the viewer has the same term memory loss as the main character.While it is almost impossible to know where you are in the story it is not irritating in the way some films can be when the story is to complicated.

He's my favorite superhero from D.C. comics and probably of all time. I'm also a big fan of Tim Burton as well. This is simply a great batman movie, Burton's batman will always be legendary because his vision for batman was perfect with the character. While Chris Nolan had the best stories for batman, Tim's look of the costume, bat-mobile and music is the best. Besides the great visuals, the development of the villains are great! Yes the story is just another batman vs the villains of the week, while Nolan's batman had more complex themes to it but batman vs a villain is really all you need for batman. This film is very controversial for that some feel it's too dark and bizarre but while the film is dark and creepy I think it all makes for a great movie. Some worried that this scared little kids but my feeling is that this movie is rated pg-13 not g so it's not exactly for little kids and I like the fact that Tim was interested in making a serious batman movie not campy or watered down for kids or pandering to marketing. While the first film felt like a Bob Kane batman this one is much more of a Tim Burton-esquire batman. I like the Christmas\/winter atmosphere, seeing Gotham covered in snow looks cool. I love Tim's take on the penguin, it's definitely a Burton penguin nothing like in the comics and even some thought he was too creepy, mean-spirited and freakish but I feel that he's the villain and should be menacing not campy. I like the back-story that he was born to rich parents who tried to drown him as a baby in shame because he was born a freak, thus he was raised in the sewer by penguins. He wants to belong in Gotham but wants revenge on Gotham, he runs for mayor, tries to drown kids and he's a little perverted but Danny Devito was perfectly cast in the role and gave what might be his best big screen performance. Michelle Pfeiffer is simply the best catwoman ever!(Julie Newmar's 2nd) Her catwoman is legendary and for good reason too! Pfeiffer gives a excellent performance as Selina Kyle, she does a great job making the transformation from wimpy secretary to the empowered catwoman. Great origin story for catwoman, Tim & company were great at making catwoman a complex and interesting villain and of course the outfit is great! She looks like a black cat with a S&M undertone. One of my favorite scenes is when we first see catwoman and she stops a man from mugging a woman and then turns against the woman, telling her that she's weak and I love when she says I am Catwoman, hear me roar! and she then back-flips away! That was awesome! Pfeiffer looks very sexy in a creepy S&M kind of a way. I love the way she uses her bull-whip, you don't want to get near her with that whip. I also love her voice. Pfeiffer's performance, her extremely tight leather outfit, mystery and story is the best part of the movie. Christopher Walken is great in his underrated performance as a 3rd villain, Max Shrek, who's interesting in his own right and fits well into the story. I love when he says what did curiosity do to the cat. Then there's Micheal Keaton returning as Batman, I understand how a lot of people criticized this film & the previous for not showing enough of batman and focusing more on the villains. Batman is definitely low key and we don't find out much about him but it works for Tim. We don't really need to see a lot of batman to understand him, it kinda works for batman to be more in the background then in the forefront. Keaton is still a great batman, he comes off as a real detective, smart. He really captures the brooding quality of batman and batman comes off as a cool superhero in this film. He's not social but he's always there to save the city. I like how Keaton plays Bruce Wayne as a reclusive millionaire loner and I like his relationship with Alfred.

Before seeing it last night I tried to drum up all of my previous memories of this film. I recalled it being wildly colorful, creative and entertaining, and it held an important message. Upon a re-watch, I realized that I still identify with most of my earlier observations, but being older and more mature, with more knowledge in general, I came to appreciate something else the film had to offer. As far as the message goes, as a child it seemed so concrete. But now older I find it hard to pin down. But it has something to do with the inner child being extinguished by the quote-unquote real world. Robin Williams is in this film. I loved him as a child, I found him funny and entertaining as well as serious when needed. His face drums up memories of Jumanji and Bicentennial Man. In this film plays the son of an eccentric toy factory owner. Where is this toy factory? The location is never established, and I believe that is intentional. Any scenery outside of the toy factory consists of rolling green fields that stretch all the way to the perfect blue sky, meeting at the horizon. The factory within is even more colorful, with bright blues, reds, whites and yellows that reminds us of childhood with its brightly colored plastic toys. Many of which are featured in this film, especially around the climax. We also see many cute, nonsensical things, such as toy ducks crossing a hallway while some characters sit and wait in their car. Why do they wait for the ducks to cross? What would it matter if the car simply ran over the lifeless, plastic ducks? Or for that matter, why do the characters dress so brightly with unnecessary flares and silly gimmicks? (ex Robin Williams's character at one point is wearing a jacket that produces smoke, a smoking jacket) Of course this leads one to the question, what's the purpose of aesthetics or art at all? Here the film makes a valid and pressing point. I came to realize that it is not in fact purposeless at all. The purpose is that the character wearing the silly outfit wants it that way. That is how he\/she prefers it. The characters here live in a world without judgment and are free to express themselves. I have a feeling that if people were given unlimited resources and freedom from judgment, they would dress like this in a world like this. Then I came to realize this this film, with its rolling green hills and perfect blue skies outside of the factory, and pure unprejudiced creation within the factory, takes place inside the mind. If you had to draw the interior of the mind, how would you draw it? Then when I realized that, everything else in the film seemed to match up nicely with human thoughts. The factory in 'Toys' is our idea of a perfect existence, being able to do whatever we wanted, free of judgment, having as much fun as possible and never growing up. This is childhood. But as the reader knows, childhood is not forever. Eventually we grow up and act not in interest of having fun as much as acting to avoid judgment or avoid bad judgment. We want to move along in unison with the rest of the people who had grown up to want the same thing. From out of this idea we get our villain, the uniformed general and brother to the original factory owner. He's what we'd call grown up and here to destroy everything childish and have the factory start producing war toys. This is our mind reaching what is called maturity. Society tells us that maturity is good, even though we can feel our inner child dying (which is also illustrated in the film, by showing a graphic toy war with flying plastic chunks and sparks). Nonetheless, the film then turns around and does something most people growing up do not do. The general, symbolizing maturity, is vanquished and the characters go on with their happy existence. Following my simile about the human mind, this part can seem confusing. But after deliberation, I concluded that the mind in the film had rid itself of the need to mature, and therefor was forever happy, free of judgment and free to express. I have a feeling that if this film was understood by more people in the way that I do, the message would be followed religiously and the film labeled as a holy scripture. It's why self-help books are so popular and for that matter, it is also why religions like Taoism, Buddhism and other beliefs that promise enlightenment are so popular. If you are a Taoist and you understand this film like I do, it would seem to be a work of art, an achievement of bliss and a goal to strive for. I give it a 9 out of 10.

Still, I was able to find enough to admire here. Sergio Leone is a director who, if nothing else, knows damn well how to stage a scene. The first hour is basically a combination of extended introductions to our main characters, but each one is incredibly tense and memorable. We meet the mysterious Harmonica (Charles Bronson) gunning down those who were out to kill him, the villainous Frank (Henry Fonda) as he shoots a child, the mischievous Cheyenne (Jason Robards) as he escapes custody and the beautiful Jill (Claudia Cardinale) as she arrives off her train.Each sequence is drawn out but doesn't feel overlong, giving us a first look at the characters that sticks with the viewer until long after the credits roll. That opening hour doesn't delve into the plot much, or the characters themselves, but it's easily my favorite area of the film as it shows a lot of what Leone is best at doing. In these scenes Leone shows his gift for building suspense, utilizing silence when it's appropriate as opposed to trying to ratchet up the tension with directorial tricks. He lets the silence build it all, giving an eerie calm so that when the violence occurs it startles you, shakes you up. In a time so desensitized to graphic violence on film, Leone knows how to make his bullets matter.The four main characters are all memorable and solidly well-acted, potentially with the exception of Harmonica. I found Bronson serviceable in his role, but the role itself wasn't one that I cared for; the whole mysterious stranger playing his harmonica because he's a badass thing was something that I found laughable almost immediately and it was hard for me to take seriously throughout the film. Bronson allowed me to get over it after a while, along with lessened use of his theme that I found incredibly grating in the opening act, but I still had a hard time not laughing at the basic idea of the character. The other three were sources of great enjoyment for me, though. Fonda goes against his persona and plays a vile bad guy, which is a genius bit of casting on Leone's part, and he uses those baby blue eyes to penetrate you so he can rip out your heart. I think it's one of his finest performances, seeing someone so adored for being wholesome take on such a cruel bastard.Claudia Cardinale is stunningly gorgeous here, but she also brings a lot of womanly fire to the boy's club. Working against people like Fonda and Bronson, it could have been easy to fall into the role of the helpless woman, but Cardinale makes Jill McBain maybe the most aggressive character in this show. She's got a ton of passion and refuses to let the men push her around. Cardinale may be my favorite performance in the film, but I'd have to say that my favorite character belongs to Jason Robards' Cheyenne. While the feud between Frank and Harmonica rages on, battling with each other while Jill is caught in the middle, Cheyenne is just a wild outlaw having fun in the midst of it all; and oh what fun Robards makes him. You can tell that Robards had a great time shooting this, and seeing him in this character brings a levity to the film that is a welcome relief.There are definitely a lot of things that I liked about this film, but for everything that I liked there was something that I disliked as well. As great as Leone is at crafting individual sequences, the film became rather tiresome once it tried to actually start doing something with it's characters and narrative. The first hour is exciting and the final half hour or so was a nice conclusion, but everything in the middle dragged on and on. I enjoyed the characters but I didn't particularly care about them, and the script writes them all so thin.Everything is too black-and-white, with a meaningless plot that was clearly created around the individual scenes. It's like they were writing their cool characters and cool sequences but then realized they had to actually make a narrative to have them exist in so they just tossed something together. It doesn't have a drive at all, despite such excellent moments. Once Upon a Time in the West is a film with a lot to admire, but for me it ended up being less than the sum of it's parts.

That opening hour doesn't delve into the plot much, or the characters themselves, but it's easily my favorite area of the film as it shows a lot of what Leone is best at doing. In these scenes Leone shows his gift for building suspense, utilizing silence when it's appropriate as opposed to trying to ratchet up the tension with directorial tricks. He lets the silence build it all, giving an eerie calm so that when the violence occurs it startles you, shakes you up. In a time so desensitized to graphic violence on film, Leone knows how to make his bullets matter.The four main characters are all memorable and solidly well-acted, potentially with the exception of Harmonica. I found Bronson serviceable in his role, but the role itself wasn't one that I cared for; the whole mysterious stranger playing his harmonica because he's a badass thing was something that I found laughable almost immediately and it was hard for me to take seriously throughout the film. Bronson allowed me to get over it after a while, along with lessened use of his theme that I found incredibly grating in the opening act, but I still had a hard time not laughing at the basic idea of the character. The other three were sources of great enjoyment for me, though. Fonda goes against his persona and plays a vile bad guy, which is a genius bit of casting on Leone's part, and he uses those baby blue eyes to penetrate you so he can rip out your heart. I think it's one of his finest performances, seeing someone so adored for being wholesome take on such a cruel bastard.Claudia Cardinale is stunningly gorgeous here, but she also brings a lot of womanly fire to the boy's club. Working against people like Fonda and Bronson, it could have been easy to fall into the role of the helpless woman, but Cardinale makes Jill McBain maybe the most aggressive character in this show. She's got a ton of passion and refuses to let the men push her around. Cardinale may be my favorite performance in the film, but I'd have to say that my favorite character belongs to Jason Robards' Cheyenne. While the feud between Frank and Harmonica rages on, battling with each other while Jill is caught in the middle, Cheyenne is just a wild outlaw having fun in the midst of it all; and oh what fun Robards makes him. You can tell that Robards had a great time shooting this, and seeing him in this character brings a levity to the film that is a welcome relief.There are definitely a lot of things that I liked about this film, but for everything that I liked there was something that I disliked as well. As great as Leone is at crafting individual sequences, the film became rather tiresome once it tried to actually start doing something with it's characters and narrative. The first hour is exciting and the final half hour or so was a nice conclusion, but everything in the middle dragged on and on. I enjoyed the characters but I didn't particularly care about them, and the script writes them all so thin.Everything is too black-and-white, with a meaningless plot that was clearly created around the individual scenes. It's like they were writing their cool characters and cool sequences but then realized they had to actually make a narrative to have them exist in so they just tossed something together. It doesn't have a drive at all, despite such excellent moments. Once Upon a Time in the West is a film with a lot to admire, but for me it ended up being less than the sum of it's parts.

No words can describe the impact of this conclusion, except maybe the melting of my heart in an ocean of tears as I could perfectly respond to the torment of Conrad Jarrett, the son, and his relationship with his father. Relationships&#x85; this is the challenging theme of Ordinary People, a psychological journey in an American suburban bourgeois family, mourning the precocious death of Bucky, the older son. Bucky was the pride of the Jarretts, the one that immediately reconciled everyone, Calvin, the father, Conrad, the brother and more than anyone, Beth, the mother and officious family leader, Mary Tyler Moore in an exceptional performance that probably deserves more regard if her figure wasn't too much associated with TV. With Bucky, it's the strongest link of the Family that went forever, and caused a series of disorders undermining the harmony that used to prevail. Harmony, God what a meaningless word when it comes to human relationships.The movie opens with the sight of a beautiful forest in an autumnal setting, it's one of these peaceful little towns, whose suburbs are occupied by the upper-class. Beth, the mother best exemplifies this universe with her constant obsession with order and social integration, as if everything in her life had to be planned and embody the same peace and harmony of the place she chose to live in. Socially, she's perfectly integrated, and with a husband as kind and understanding as Calvin, never was she contradicted. In a certain way, everything seems to point Conrad Jarrett as the true and only troublemaker, the one who committed suicide as a protest against his own failure to save his brother. As the movie progresses and the flashbacks give us more insights, we're plunged in the depths of Conrad's trauma and understand that he blamed himself for having survived the very incident that caused his brother's death.But the film takes its time to let us assemble the puzzle and this is the remarkable achievement of Redford, he's not just a talented director but an amazing storyteller. He doesn't use the core of the story, which is obviously Conrad's guilt, as the reason to be of the film, but on the contrary, to speak much more important statements about the failure to communicate within the Family circle. This failure is not meant to put the blame on someone, we're left with what we see, and no character seems to behave in the right or the wrong way. But as we get to know more about Beth, Conrad and Calvin, we understand that an evolution needs to be accomplished in a way or another. Hutton is sublime in his Oscar-winning performance as Conrad, the heart of the story, and far from the clichéd awkward teenager who slams the doors at his parents, he loves his parents, and he's aware of his behavior and tries to fix it by consulting a shrink, Judd Hirsch, Oscar-nominated as the Dr. Berger.Conrad's journey involves a sweet romance with a girl from his choir, Jannine (Elizabeth McGovern). Whether from Berger or Jannine, the therapy has a direction and it leads to the knowledge of the truth and the roots of guilt, meanwhile, the Jarretts couple takes a slowest evolution. It seems that Beth is still leading the show, but Calvin, inclined for more generosity and empathy, understands that there is a problem within his own marriage, a sort of sickness that made him follow his wife with a blindness that never questioned what was the place of every one in Beth's heart, apart from Bucky, who was naturally, the highlight of her life. The film beautifully portrays the irony of an adult couple too afraid to face responsibilities, with a woman in constant denial and a man afraid to ask the right questions. After visiting Dr. Berger, Calvin is asked about his relationship with Beth, he says that everything is all right, with a nervous smile. The next scene is pivotal in the evolution of Calvin, when he asks Beth why she was so careful about the way he would dress for Bucky's funerals.Ironically, the most immature and tormented character took his responsibilities and achieved his own catharsis, but the intelligence of the script and its extraordinary realism allow all the characters to face their responsibilities. In the heartbreaking climactic moment, Calvin finally opens his heart to Beth and delivers one of these monologues that make you wonder how Donald Sutherland didn't even get an Oscar nomination. After courageously admitting that he's not sure of his feelings anymore, Beth goes to bed, and has for the first time in all the film, a moment of weakness. Mary Tyler Moore sublimates the figure of a strong mother whose throne vacillates, she opens her mouth, she's about to cry, to shout, to breakdown, but she restrains and decides to leave. Incapable of changing, she voluntarily banishes herself from the house and leaves for a while, not as an antagonist, but as a victim of her own blindness. The two men stay outside and their exchange proves that they changed, and would start to face life with serenity, bravery, more confidence and less guilt. And this leads to one of the most beautiful conclusions ever shot in a film, and a tribute to those who consider the film didn't deserve to win the Best Picture award over the much more iconic Raging Bull or The Elephant Man. I couldn't care less about these considerations after having seen the shattering and magnificent Ordinary People.

And some other times, as we're mourning the passing of a beloved family member, I find myself sitting at a table, laughing at the jokes of my uncle, or remembering some funny anecdotes involving the one who's not with us anymore. Go figure why, but we humans have this strange tendency to lean over a feeling that is opposite to the situation we endure, like a sort of defensive reaction. Happiness reminds us how we must seize the day, and death how great it is to live. So that's it, we laugh when we should be sad and cry when we should laugh. Actually, life teaches us that there's no 'should' when it comes to feelings, and its beauty is to make us swing back and forth between happy and sad memories. And to a certain extent, faithful to this very comedic aspect that can't go without a few tears, Terms of Endearment embodies the passing of life as this big joke with a sad punch line we all laugh, have great time, but every once in a while, a sad event comes to remind us what is waiting for us. It follows a streak of successful Best Picture winning family dramas, such as Kramer vs. Kramer and Ordinary People, but Terms of Endearment is slightly superior in the way it dares to approach life with an intelligent mix of detachment and irony but never without a profound and inspiring humanism.Still, what a strange film! No wait, I shouldn't even use the word 'film' because by no chances, does it try to exploit some cinematic conventions in order to extract the right feelings from its audience. Albert Brooks not only trusts our intelligence but also our patience as the story plunges us in the world of Aurora and Emma, Shirley MecLaine and Debra Winger, mother and daughter. I say 'strange' film because it has the curious feel of a TV movie without the archetypes of a vulgar soap opera, it's made with a modest tone of pastel colors and following an episodic structure, like so many slices of people's lives, people no worse or better than you and I, but the flow is so fluid and perfect that we let ourselves guided by the story, never really expecting for something to happen, we're just put here as witnesses of a story, which exemplifies our own vision of life.And that's the remarkable exploit of the film, the key that forged its success. Terms of Endearment, which is unlike any film made before, was one of the highest grossing of 1983 and although I found The Right Stuff to be a much more extraordinary experience (and most deserving of the Best Picture award), Terms of Endearment possesses an endearing quality, which relies on its faithful approach to life, something made of laughs, anger, sadness and fears, simply put the four main emotions that drive our feelings. Terms of Endearment finds the perfect tone and balance between laughs and sadness, comic and pathos. In a way, the film can remind of Love Story without an hyperbolic classicism that could have ruined it.Emma the daughter, has this burning passion in her heart just like Ali McGraw's character and her mother works as the total opposite, she seems cold and distant, criticizing all her daughter's choices, above them all the decision to marry a teacher named Flap (Jeff Daniels). But Emma never decides, she just lives while Aurora uses her maturity and status as a courted widow to better not to look at her own issues. The interactions between Emma and Aurora seems so genuine that I wondered if the two actresses were really mother and daughter. You could tell that these two women were the best friends in the world, with this unique complicity that couldn't only be translated into awkward reactions. One of the biggest issues that undermine the characters' interactions is the impossible communication of true feelings and the way it's handled provides the comedic spice of the film.At a pivotal moment, Aurora finally decides to invite Garrett Breedlove, the ex-astronaut, neighbor since years and infamous for his lust for younger women, just to see her 'Renoir', referring to a very precious painting -a second reading at these lines makes the whole situation subtly hilarious. And not only this role was so tailor-made for Nicholson that it earned him his second Oscar win, but Mac Laine is the perfect match for him, and Brooks knew how to build a believable chemistry between them. At one point, Garrett makes a whole rhapsody about the way he feels things are getting too serious for his taste, to be interrupted by Aurora's reactions, it's funny but it also shows that not only she's no fool, but she doesn't even feel hurt. The film avoids two opposite clichés, turning them into derision to better show the futility of all that stuff. Another crucial scene is Emma's monologue in New York City on the way she feels about people's problems, an extraordinary moment I don't want to spoil. The film evolves beautifully with a last act that is forever rooted in our memories, thanks to the remarkable performances of both Debra Winger and Shirley MacLaine, surrounded by great supporting performances. The film doesn't feature iconic moments, isn't renowned for a particular quote, but it has a level of emotionality that has often been copied but never equaled. And to give you an idea if you haven't seen it yet, just listen to Michael Gore's magnificent theme and it will give you an idea.

At one point, Garrett makes a whole rhapsody about the way he feels things are getting too serious for his taste, to be interrupted by Aurora's reactions, it's funny but it also shows that not only she's no fool, but she doesn't even feel hurt. The film avoids two opposite clichés, turning them into derision to better show the futility of all that stuff. Another crucial scene is Emma's monologue in New York City on the way she feels about people's problems, an extraordinary moment I don't want to spoil. The film evolves beautifully with a last act that is forever rooted in our memories, thanks to the remarkable performances of both Debra Winger and Shirley MacLaine, surrounded by great supporting performances. The film doesn't feature iconic moments, isn't renowned for a particular quote, but it has a level of emotionality that has often been copied but never equaled. And to give you an idea if you haven't seen it yet, just listen to Michael Gore's magnificent theme and it will give you an idea. ","genre":"Comedy, Drama"}]
