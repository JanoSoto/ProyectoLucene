With those elements Clerks is a great Comedy,a classic of Independent cinema and Kevin Smith at his best.Set in Leonardo,New Jersey,Clerks tells the day in the life story of Dante Hicks(Brian O'Halloran) and Randal Graves(Jeff Anderson),two twenty somethings and best friends who work at a Quick Stop convenience store and video store next door to each other. While at work,Dante and Randal have to deal with hilarious situations involving offbeat and annoying customers as well as dealing with themselves. There is also a Marijuana dealing duo named Jay(Jason Mewes) and Silent Bob(Kevin Smith)who hang outside the stores and add to the insanity.Released in 1994,Clerks is a brilliant and hilarious low budget Comedy that marked the directorial debut of writer-director Kevin Smith who sold his Comic Book collection and maxed out credit cards to make the film on a 27,000 dollar budget and in Black and White. Clerks not only was a critical and commercial success but also a Cult Classic that was the first in Kevin Smith's View Askewniverse Comedies which also included Mallrats(1995),Chasing Amy(1997),Dogma(1999),Jay And Silent Bob Strike Back(2001)and Clerks II(2006)and also introduced the famous stoner duo Jay and Silent Bob. Clerks is one of those films that is a Comedy classic from the moment you first watch,a funny and offbeat film that gives viewers a outrageous tale of what it's like to work at a convenience store showing how dull and boring the job is with moments of bizarre and weird things. The Comedy and laughs in Clerks are hilarious and will make your stomach hurt and cry your eyes out because the humor in Clerks has a great balance between going over the top and being realistic with the over the top nature being with the characters and dialog that gives the Comedy a stylish feel that is in a world of it's own and the Comedy is at times cynical and in your face but not mean spirited. The Comedy is realistic(and demented)in showing how the characters Dante and Randal deal with customers and their work place how the two really don't want to be there at all. The Comedy in Clerks would also be the beginning of Smith's signature style that would be in Smith's other View Askew moviespop culture references to the Star Wars films and other movies,Comic Books,Superheros and sexual related jokes and all of started here in Clerks and would continue in his later films. Clerks is a movie that is not only funny but also at times(due to it's low budget and Black and White photography)has a gritty fly one the wall style that isn't pretty or beautiful but real and accurate showing viewers a world that exists in our everyday life even if the world of Clerks is silly. I also love the fact the movie takes place over the course of one day because when a film is set on one day anything can happen. The main characters Dante and Randal are classic characters from Kevin Smith's mind the classic example of the straight man and funny guy. Like I said before,Dante and Randal don't want to work at their corner stores but feel like they have to be there because they have nothing else to do with their life and have no ambitions. With Dante we see that the character is miserable and in a funk he's a College dropout,he has to deal with the relationships in his life whether it's Randal,his present girlfriend or ex-girlfriend and the way the relationships are handled is funny. Randal is different person from Dante because where Dante is miserable and upset about his life,Randal loves the way things are for himself and doesn't have any high ambitions for his life and does things his way not giving a crap about the customers or about what anyone else thinks. The friendship between Dante and Randal while hectic and crazy feels genuine and real and you will feel that despite their differences the two care for one another. The relationship and banter between Dante and Randal is one of the things that make the movie a classic and a great film. The screenplay by Kevin Smith is terrific and funny,with Smith giving the movie and it's characters dialog and scenes that are raunchy and offbeat and done in a way that is profane and ironic only way Kevin Smith knows how(so profane that the Clerks originally received an NC-17 from the MPAA). The ending of Clerks is amazing because while it's funny it also makes you think with a hint of truth and depth. A great ending.The cast is good. Brian O'Holloran is wonderful and funny as Dante,with O'Holloran playing the laughs in a straight manner. Jeff Anderson is terrific and hilarious as Randal,with Anderson stealing every scene he's in. Marylin Ghigliotti does a good job as Veronica,Dante's girlfriend. Lisa Spoonauer does a fine job as Caitlin Bree,Dante's ex-girlfriend. Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith are fantastic and laugh out loud funny as Jay And Silent Bob,Mariuana dealers that hangout in front of the store.The direction by Kevin Smith is simple but great,with Smith pointing the camera and shooting and at times using handled camera movements to a nice effect. Fine direction,Smith.The soundtrack for Clerks(which was more expensive than the entire film)has great songs by Soul Asylum(Can't Even Tell),Alice In Chains(Got Me Wrong),Bad Religion(Leaders And Followers),Corrision Of Conformity(Big Problems),Love Among Freaks(Clerks,Berserker)Girls Against Boys(Kill The Sax Player),Stabbing Westward(Violent Mood Swings),Bash & Pop(Making Me Sick),Seaweed(Go Your Own Way),Supernova(Chewbacca),The Jesus Lizard(Panic In Cicero)and Golden Smog(Shooting Star). Amazing soundtrack.In final word,if you love Kevin Smith,Comedies,Independent Films or films in general,I highly suggest you see Clerks,an excellent,hilarious and unforgettable Comedy\/Cult Classic that you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10\/10.
