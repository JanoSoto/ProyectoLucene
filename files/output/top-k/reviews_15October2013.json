As I said before, the best movie that was based on a computer game was Super Mario Bros, and Mortal Kombat does not knock that movie off of its stand.My friend, after seeing it the first time, was surprised that it followed the game so closely (please). Basically it is a movie about a martial arts competition with some guys with funky powers and a plot thrown in. The plot is that the emperor of Outworld wants to conquer Earth, and to do that he must win the Mortal Kombat competition 10 times in a row, and guess what, he was won it nine times in a row so if he wins this time he gets Earth, so three people, Sonja Blade, Liu Kang, and Johnny Kage, join to defeat him.To me Mortal Kombat is a try-hard American movie trying to be a Hong Kong movie. The effects were good, but that is one thing that you expect from American movies, and generally good special effects cover up very bad plots. The movies with bad special effects generally have much better plots, which is why low-budget movies are generally far better, and I look at Doctor Who and Clerks to support me in this argument.The other annoying thing was that the characters had flaws which they had to overcome. The use of flaws is not bad, but when it is you must overcome your weakness to succeed Johnny Kage then it gets a bit pathetic. A real movie which uses flaws has these flaws constantly dragging the character down until a point where if he does win, it is a hollow victory because he has lost so much along the way. This is not such a movie.Simply Mortal Kombat is a try hard movie, and when the sequel hit the screens, it basically passed without a comment.

I was not familiar with anything Cat on a Hot Tin Roof related, so I found this to be a pretty grim, yet rewarding experience. We don't have anybody to root for, really. Many of the characters are self absorbed, and have many questionable motives, especially the daughter of Big Daddy; Mae (Madeline Sherwood) It's hard to like a person who clearly just cares about money and inheritance, rather than her ailing father, and her family. Brick Pollit (Newman's character) is hard to endure, as he wallows in misery for almost the entire film, while drinking almost non- stop. His cold and somewhat callous character at times is quite depressing to watch. I did admire how the movie slowly builds its mystery, and developed the characters. When it is revealed as to why Brick is so callous, I managed to empathize with his plight a little bit more. Paul Newman is incredible in this film, and managed to convey his emotions to near perfection. For a man to be so unlikable for most of the film, and win me over near the end, takes a lot of talent. I did understand his frustration, though in a way. His chemistry with Elizabeth Taylor is unforgettable, and the two often provide magic on the screen. Elizabeth Taylor is just as vital to the film's success as Newman, and she was equally as good. Maggie is a housewife who I would love to have as my wife. The stuff she endures and puts up with is amazing. I give Elizabeth Taylor just as much credit as Paul Newman. Both of their performances are absolutely legendary. Burl Ives eccentricities serve this film well,and his imposing performance was excellent. His character isn't all that sympathetic either. He's brazen, stubborn, and treats his wife like dirt, but he was very good. I've given this film a bit of criticism due to its mean spiritedness, but I actually really liked the film.

The film's opening scene shows him being given two life sentences for the murder of his wife and her lover, and then we move, permanently, to a point of view representing the prison population and particularly the lifer Ellis 'Red' Redding (Morgan Freeman).From Andy's arrival on the prison bus to the film's end, we see only how others see him - Red, who becomes his best friend, Brooks the old librarian, the corrupt Warden Norton, guards and prisoners. Red is our surrogate. He's the one we identify with, and the redemption, when it comes, is Red's. We've been shown by Andy's example that you have to keep true to yourself, not lose hope, bide your time, set a quiet example and look for your chance. I guess it comes down to a simple choice, really, he tells Red. Get busy livin' or get busy dyin'. The key to the film's structure, I think, is that it's not about its hero, but about our relationship with him - our curiosity, our pity, our admiration. If Andy had been the heroic center, bravely enduring, the film would have been conventional, and less mysterious. But we wonder about this guy. Did he really kill those two people? Why does he keep so much to himself? Why can he amble through the prison yard like a free man on a stroll? People like excitement at the movies, and other titles provide that. But there's a hunger for messages of hope, and when a film offers one, it's likely to have staying power even if it doesn't grab an immediate audience.The movie premiered at the Toronto Film Festival in September 1994, and opened a few weeks later. It got good reviews but did poor business ($18 million B.O.; only another $10 million after 7 Oscar noms).There wasn't much going for it It had a terrible title, it was a prison drama, it contained almost no action, starred actors who were not big stars, and it was long at 142 minutes. This was a movie that needed word-of-mouth to find an audience.Then, in one of the most remarkable stories in home video history, it found its real mass audience on tapes & TV. In five years, Shawshank was a phenomenon, a video best renter and seller. When the Wall Street Journal ran an article about Shawshank in 1999, it was first place in the IMDb vote of 250 best films.Polls and rentals reflect popularity but don't explain why people value Shawshank so fervently. It does have entertaining payoff moments (as when Andy does all of the guards taxes). But much of the movie involves quiet, solitude, and philosophical discussions about life. The moments of violence are seen objectively, not exploited. The movie avoids lingering on Andy's suffering.The Morgan Freeman character is carrier of the film's spiritual arc. We see him at three parole hearings, decades apart. The first hearing involves storytelling trickery; the film has opened with Andy's sentencing, and as we see the parole board we expect to listen to Andy's appeal. But, no, that's when we first see Red. In his first appeal he tries to convince the board he's been rehabilitated. In the second, he just goes through the motions. In the third, he rejects the whole notion of rehabilitation, and somehow in doing so he sets his spirit free and is released.There's an underlying problem. Behind bars, Red is king. He's the prison fixer, able to get you a pack of cigarettes, a little rock pick or a Rita Hayworth poster. On the outside, he has no status or identity. We've already seen what happened to the old librarian (James Whitmore), lonely and adrift in freedom. The last act, in which Andy helps Red accept his freedom, is deeply moving - all the more so because Andy again operates at a distance, with letters and postcards, and is seen through Red's mind.Frank Darabont wrote and directed the film, basing it on a story by Stephen King. His film grants itself a leisure that most films are afraid to risk. The movie is as deliberate, considered and thoughtful as Freeman's narration.Deliberate, too, is the dialogue. Tim Robbins makes Andy a man of few words, quietly spoken. He doesn't get real worked up. He is his own man, capable of keeping his head down for years and then indulging in a grand gesture, as when he plays an aria from Mozart's The Marriage of Figaro. (The overhead shot of the prisoners in the yard, spellbound by the music, is one of the film's epiphanies.)Roger Deakins' cinematography is tactful, not showy. Two opening shots, one from a helicopter, one of prison walls looming overhead, establish the prison. Shots follow the dialogue instead of anticipating it. Thomas Newman's music enhances rather than informs, and there is a subtle touch in the way deep bass rumblings during the early murder are reprised when a young prisoner recalls another man's description of the crime.Darabont constructs the film to observe the story, not to punch it up or upstage it. When they put you in that cell, Red says, when those bars slam home,that's when you know it's for real. Old life blown away in the blink of an eye. Nothing left but all the time in the world to think about it.Affection for good films often grows with familiarity, as it does with music. Some have said life is a prison, we are Red, Andy is our redeemer. All good art is about something deeper than it admits.

In the third, he rejects the whole notion of rehabilitation, and somehow in doing so he sets his spirit free and is released.There's an underlying problem. Behind bars, Red is king. He's the prison fixer, able to get you a pack of cigarettes, a little rock pick or a Rita Hayworth poster. On the outside, he has no status or identity. We've already seen what happened to the old librarian (James Whitmore), lonely and adrift in freedom. The last act, in which Andy helps Red accept his freedom, is deeply moving - all the more so because Andy again operates at a distance, with letters and postcards, and is seen through Red's mind.Frank Darabont wrote and directed the film, basing it on a story by Stephen King. His film grants itself a leisure that most films are afraid to risk. The movie is as deliberate, considered and thoughtful as Freeman's narration.Deliberate, too, is the dialogue. Tim Robbins makes Andy a man of few words, quietly spoken. He doesn't get real worked up. He is his own man, capable of keeping his head down for years and then indulging in a grand gesture, as when he plays an aria from Mozart's The Marriage of Figaro. (The overhead shot of the prisoners in the yard, spellbound by the music, is one of the film's epiphanies.)Roger Deakins' cinematography is tactful, not showy. Two opening shots, one from a helicopter, one of prison walls looming overhead, establish the prison. Shots follow the dialogue instead of anticipating it. Thomas Newman's music enhances rather than informs, and there is a subtle touch in the way deep bass rumblings during the early murder are reprised when a young prisoner recalls another man's description of the crime.Darabont constructs the film to observe the story, not to punch it up or upstage it. When they put you in that cell, Red says, when those bars slam home,that's when you know it's for real. Old life blown away in the blink of an eye. Nothing left but all the time in the world to think about it.Affection for good films often grows with familiarity, as it does with music. Some have said life is a prison, we are Red, Andy is our redeemer. All good art is about something deeper than it admits. ","genre":"Crime, Drama"},{"date":"15 October 2013","score":"","review":" Classic review by R.E.This is a film that is deeper than most films; about continuity in a lifetime, based on friendship and hope.Interesting that although the hero of the film is the convicted former banker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), the action is never seen from his point of view. The film's opening scene shows him being given two life sentences for the murder of his wife and her lover, and then we move, permanently, to a point of view representing the prison population and particularly the lifer Ellis 'Red' Redding (Morgan Freeman).From Andy's arrival on the prison bus to the film's end, we see only how others see him - Red, who becomes his best friend, Brooks the old librarian, the corrupt Warden Norton, guards and prisoners. Red is our surrogate. He's the one we identify with, and the redemption, when it comes, is Red's. We've been shown by Andy's example that you have to keep true to yourself, not lose hope, bide your time, set a quiet example and look for your chance. I guess it comes down to a simple choice, really, he tells Red. Get busy livin' or get busy dyin'. The key to the film's structure, I think, is that it's not about its hero, but about our relationship with him - our curiosity, our pity, our admiration. If Andy had been the heroic center, bravely enduring, the film would have been conventional, and less mysterious. But we wonder about this guy. Did he really kill those two people? Why does he keep so much to himself? Why can he amble through the prison yard like a free man on a stroll? People like excitement at the movies, and other titles provide that. But there's a hunger for messages of hope, and when a film offers one, it's likely to have staying power even if it doesn't grab an immediate audience.The movie premiered at the Toronto Film Festival in September 1994, and opened a few weeks later. It got good reviews but did poor business ($18 million B.O.; only another $10 million after 7 Oscar noms).There wasn't much going for it It had a terrible title, it was a prison drama, it contained almost no action, starred actors who were not big stars, and it was long at 142 minutes. This was a movie that needed word-of-mouth to find an audience.Then, in one of the most remarkable stories in home video history, it found its real mass audience on tapes & TV. In five years, Shawshank was a phenomenon, a video best renter and seller. When the Wall Street Journal ran an article about Shawshank in 1999, it was first place in the IMDb vote of 250 best films.Polls and rentals reflect popularity but don't explain why people value Shawshank so fervently. It does have entertaining payoff moments (as when Andy does all of the guards taxes). But much of the movie involves quiet, solitude, and philosophical discussions about life. The moments of violence are seen objectively, not exploited. The movie avoids lingering on Andy's suffering.The Morgan Freeman character is carrier of the film's spiritual arc. We see him at three parole hearings, decades apart. The first hearing involves storytelling trickery; the film has opened with Andy's sentencing, and as we see the parole board we expect to listen to Andy's appeal. But, no, that's when we first see Red. In his first appeal he tries to convince the board he's been rehabilitated. In the second, he just goes through the motions. In the third, he rejects the whole notion of rehabilitation, and somehow in doing so he sets his spirit free and is released.There's an underlying problem. Behind bars, Red is king.

So when a scientist at a genetic engineering lab tells him about the cloning technology, he decides to snap it up. Soon he has a clone to do his job and the housework while he can go out and enjoy himself. Things are not that easy though because he is trying to keep his clones a secret and they simply want to live a normal life.I guess there are two ideas in this movie this first is responsibility and the second is the nature of the clone. In this movie we see the hero trying to escape his responsibilities by placing the burdens upon other people. We see the frustrations he has with other people at the beginning of the movie where he feels that he cannot assign tasks to anybody. He is constantly pushing them out of the way so that he may do the job himself. It doesn't help his problems at all though. When he has a clone doing his job, he finds that housekeeping takes over all of his free time, so he gets one to do his jobs there.The clones, interestingly enough, begin to develop their own personalities (which shows us Michael Keaton's acting ability), but the original is not interested in them leading their own lives. He created them for a specific job and that is the job that they must do. This raises the idea as to whether these clones are real people or property. The original treats them as property, but we notice that they want their own lives and want to do their own thing. They even clone themselves, which creates a less efficient one. Through all of this, the original is trying to hide them and stop them from enjoying themselves.When one thinks about them, it is not really possible to create clones to do one's work, as when the clone is created, it becomes a separate person and as such has its own memories, which it does not share with the original. Not only that, they are real people with real desires, and to prevent them from enjoying themselves is like preventing a real person from enjoying themselves, but then they are real people.In conclusion, this is an okay movie, which is slightly twisted, but generally dull.

Oh Shakespeare, where art thou? Besides the name, Andrzej Bartkowiak's action movie Romeo Must Die has not so much in common with Shakespeare's tragedy. The first scenes sound promising and I felt encouraged to expect a modern, innovative, of course different, but still somehow close adaptation of Romeo and Juliet. The Chinese and the African American clans who are fighting over the control of the Oakland waterfront seem to be appropriate representatives of the Montagues and the Capulets but after a while, every relation to the known storyline seems to get lost. The only parallel is the 'love story' between Han (an ex-cop who breaks out off a prison in Hong Kong after the death of his brother to find his murderer) and Trish (the daughter of an African American mob boss) who belong to the different houses. ut different from Romeo and Juliet, the relationship between Han and Trish does not seem to be one of the most important conflicts. The two clans rather try to beat each other in making money by criminal intrigues and they do not like the idea of seeing their children in a relationship with a member of the other family because the Capulets and Montagues do not either &#x96; that is how I feel about it. It is rather a 'forced' parallel between the Shakespearian play and the modern movie and not one that develops naturally. In my opinion, the Romeo-and-Julia scheme is just a clever strategy of advertising for the movie to attract viewers. Jet Li (Romeo) makes obvious that he is a great martial artist who really knows Wushu. He is able to beat five prison guards while he is hanging upside down with his hands manacled. If you like Kung Fu movies, you definitely should watch Romeo Must Die. The fighting scenes are actually the only ones that are really worth watching. Do not be scared of too much romance and love story since Romeo is not a romantic hero at all. Between Romeo and Juliet &#x96; in this case Han Sing and Trish O'Day (played by American R&B singer Aaliyah) no sparks are flying at all. Jet Li plays his role quite charming, playful and always with a little wink. He even mocks himself by pretending to be a Chinese deliverer. It is a pleasure to watch him play but he does not fulfill the expectations raised by the title of the film. Trish, the modern Juliet, is played by Aaliyah who has her film debut as an actress. Trish is portrayed as a modern, emancipated, and good-hearted woman. She is working in an institution for children which is her own business. She does not really see why she should obey to her father and stay inside the house or under surveillance of her guides all the time and takes every chance to get rid of her bodyguard Maurice. When he recognizes that she has left him he follows her shouting &#x84;Trish! I'm gonna find your Aaliyah-lookin' ass! &#x96; one example of the funny details that Bartkowiak implements into this movie. The main problem of the movie is that it does not use advantage of any of the genres it combines. It is neither a love story, nor a comedy, nor a full action or hip-hop movie. In total, it does not have a stringent storyline. It tries to put everything into one film comedy elements like a group of men, caught in a deadlock with their guns pointing at each other, fat Maurice who is not able to look after Trish because he is so busy with dancing and flirting or Han who has his problems to drive in San Francisco; all the hilarious fighting scenes where we can only see flying fists and feet or where Han beats all the African American guys in football just by using his Kung Fu or Wushu techniques; a mob story that includes different ethnic groups and a love story that should link everything but fails in doing that because there is actually no romance or at least flirting between the protagonists. Even when they are dancing in a casino, we cannot see any feeling evolving at all &#x96; and as many movies have shown us yet, dancing is always a good way to get closer together. In sum, I would recommend this movie to people who like Kung Fu and Jet Li in action &#x96;that is what you get if you watch this movie.

Trish is portrayed as a modern, emancipated, and good-hearted woman. She is working in an institution for children which is her own business. She does not really see why she should obey to her father and stay inside the house or under surveillance of her guides all the time and takes every chance to get rid of her bodyguard Maurice. When he recognizes that she has left him he follows her shouting &#x84;Trish! I'm gonna find your Aaliyah-lookin' ass! &#x96; one example of the funny details that Bartkowiak implements into this movie. The main problem of the movie is that it does not use advantage of any of the genres it combines. It is neither a love story, nor a comedy, nor a full action or hip-hop movie. In total, it does not have a stringent storyline. It tries to put everything into one film comedy elements like a group of men, caught in a deadlock with their guns pointing at each other, fat Maurice who is not able to look after Trish because he is so busy with dancing and flirting or Han who has his problems to drive in San Francisco; all the hilarious fighting scenes where we can only see flying fists and feet or where Han beats all the African American guys in football just by using his Kung Fu or Wushu techniques; a mob story that includes different ethnic groups and a love story that should link everything but fails in doing that because there is actually no romance or at least flirting between the protagonists. Even when they are dancing in a casino, we cannot see any feeling evolving at all &#x96; and as many movies have shown us yet, dancing is always a good way to get closer together. In sum, I would recommend this movie to people who like Kung Fu and Jet Li in action &#x96;that is what you get if you watch this movie.

Oh Shakespeare, where art thou? Besides the name, Andrzej Bartkowiak's action movie Romeo Must Die has not so much in common with Shakespeare's tragedy. The first scenes sound promising and I felt encouraged to expect a modern, innovative, of course different, but still somehow close adaptation of Romeo and Juliet. The Chinese and the African American clans who are fighting over the control of the Oakland waterfront seem to be appropriate representatives of the Montagues and the Capulets but after a while, every relation to the known storyline seems to get lost. The only parallel is the 'love story' between Han (an ex-cop who breaks out off a prison in Hong Kong after the death of his brother to find his murderer) and Trish (the daughter of an African American mob boss) who belong to the different houses. ut different from Romeo and Juliet, the relationship between Han and Trish does not seem to be one of the most important conflicts. The two clans rather try to beat each other in making money by criminal intrigues and they do not like the idea of seeing their children in a relationship with a member of the other family because the Capulets and Montagues do not either &#x96; that is how I feel about it. It is rather a 'forced' parallel between the Shakespearian play and the modern movie and not one that develops naturally. In my opinion, the Romeo-and-Julia scheme is just a clever strategy of advertising for the movie to attract viewers. Jet Li (Romeo) makes obvious that he is a great martial artist who really knows Wushu. He is able to beat five prison guards while he is hanging upside down with his hands manacled. If you like Kung Fu movies, you definitely should watch Romeo Must Die. The fighting scenes are actually the only ones that are really worth watching. Do not be scared of too much romance and love story since Romeo is not a romantic hero at all. Between Romeo and Juliet &#x96; in this case Han Sing and Trish O'Day (played by American R&B singer Aaliyah) no sparks are flying at all. Jet Li plays his role quite charming, playful and always with a little wink. He even mocks himself by pretending to be a Chinese deliverer. It is a pleasure to watch him play but he does not fulfill the expectations raised by the title of the film. Trish, the modern Juliet, is played by Aaliyah who has her film debut as an actress.

In this movie a senator dies and a replacement is needed, namely somebody who will be nothing more than a stooge. They have a few names in mind, but at dinner, the governor asks his kids and they all suggest Jefferson Smith (James Stewart), a local Boy Rangers leader. So suddenly this innocent man's life is changed as he goes from a humble Boy Ranger to a United States Senator.The movie is about the corruption that flows through the government. The government was angered at this movie, claiming that it would spoil the reputation of the nation, but it does serve to destroy the naivety that people have about what really goes on in the government. Jefferson Smith is a yes man, and would have played along nicely, visiting Memorials and generally having a huge amount of faith in the system, except that he puts forth a bill which clashes with a dam that is being built. He quickly learns that his colleague and an number of other congressmen are being controlled by a business man from his state. He controls everything in the state and uses his power to get what he wants. Quickly Smith learns that there is little freedom in Washington, but rather a group of elected stooges that are controlled by corporate giants.The movie quickly becomes a battle between this lowly senator and the industrial machine. His few days in Washington quickly bring him out of his naivety to make a stand for his beliefs. Jefferson Smith is an honest man and honourable man. He refuses to bow to the pressure of the industrial machine. When they try to destroy him by creating lies about him, they learn that Smith will not go out silently. Instead he holds the floor of the senate in an effort to bring the truth to the people, yet the industrial machine moves on, trying to destroy him. In the end it is the morality of his colleague that allows him to win through. Thus what we see by the end of this movie is that even though the industrial machine controls the state, a vigilant man has the ability to bring it down.Mr Smith goes to Washington is one of Capra's left wing movies. It is one that criticises the industrial machine and how it seeks to smash over the individual. It is not a government of the people, by the people, and for the people, but rather a government controlled by the industrial machine. It has no care for the person but rather for the increased profit of the corporate bosses. It is a movie that calls out to us to see what the government has become and seek to change it.

","genre":"Horror"},{"date":"15 October 2013","score":"","review":" The mummy is sort of a cross between a super-natural horror movie and Indiana Jones. Personally I see the horror as being rather small and the movie focusing more on the Indiana Jones aspect of it. Okay, the movie doesn't involve Nazis but does involve evil undead romping about Egypt seeking immortality, but that doesn't make in a bad movie.Three thousand years ago, the high priest Imhotep (who in reality was a great architect who designed and built the first pyramids and became a god) was in love with the Pharaoh's wife. Unfortunately the Pharaoh did not appreciate people touching her so when the Pharaoh caught them the Pharaoh's daughter committed suicide. Imhoptep then took her body to the city of the dead to resurrect her, but before the ceremony was complete, the guards caught them and punished Imhotep to suffer the biggest of curses, to be mummified alive and placed in a coffin full of scarab beetles.The movie then jumps to 1926 where the action happens. A soldier, Conner (Brendon Fraser) stumbles on the mythical city of the dead and finds a key. The key is pick pocketed by the brother of a librarian who dreams to be an archaeologist (who reminds me of one of my classical studies lecturers) and upon discovering that it points to the location of the city, they save the soldier from death and go out seeking the city. The movie goes into a race between them and some cowboy like Americans, and once they have found the city, they ignorantly find Imhotep's coffin, and by reading the wrong words from the wrong book, they animate him. Thus Imhotep begins his quest to regenerate his body and then resurrect his girlfriend.I think the plot is pretty good. My friend did not like it for a number of reasons. One were the plagues, which were the result of the mummy coming back to life, but in reality were a sign of God's judgement upon the Egyptians. It is also interesting as the plague of hail is always fire. They were not in the same order either. I personally did not worry about this because I was enjoying the movie. I can be critical of some movies, but the plot kept me hooked and I was able to suspend my disbelief. I liked the mummy, and though the critics might rip it to shreds, I will not.

","genre":"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"},{"date":"15 October 2013","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Being a great fan of Gaston Leroux's original novel, the 1925 silent version of The Phantom of the Opera with Lon Chaney is one of my favorite films. The only thing missing is the sound. So when I got the chance, I viewed this 1943 adaptation with Claude Rains, expecting it to be fairly good, with a star like him in the lead. Instead, I found it confusing and disappointing. I hate when screenwriters feel the need to justify their existence by rewriting a story that is already fine as it is. The film bears little resemblance to the book, with insipid subplots and overly-long scenes of invented operas taking up the bulk of the story (apparently, the film makers couldn't secure rights to well-known operas, which explains the absence of the vitally important excerpts from Faust). Because of this, the film becomes a showcase for sound and Technicolor, not the magnificent Gothic Horror\/Mystery story that Leroux imagined. It isn't mysterious or romantic, just a mixed bag of silly characters and a meandering plot that is much too predictable.The one redeeming quality of this film is Claude Rains as the titular character. The few brief moments he is on screen, he gives a beautiful portrayal of a tragic genius driven to murder for the woman he loves--the only problem is, you don't see him enough! Rains is an excellent actor, but isn't given the chance to become a really great Phantom due to his lack of screen time and the significant changes made to the plot. You see his character before he becomes the Phantom, which robs the viewer of feeling any tension of wondering who this cloaked figure is, something that was almost overwhelming in the silent version; and after that, he becomes almost a secondary character to Susanna Foster as Christine and her two (two!) adversarial suitors, whose incessant squabbling add nothing to the plot. He is given a few scenes of passion, but they are mostly toward the end, and due to the fact that in this story, he becomes disfigured by an accident and not born with his deformity, his aching for love and acceptance is far less compelling.Do yourself a favor, and go out and watch the Lon Chaney version instead. It stays much closer to the original story and is highly watchable, despite its age. This film, not so much.
