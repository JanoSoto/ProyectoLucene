It's useless to say that Weegan broaches with a lot of easiness, the trendy subjects of adolescence like sex, drugs and horror moviesMoreover, Keenan Ivory Weegan draws up a distressing portrait of his young actors; not only are they real cowards (which is normal) but they're also crude, dumb and above all sex maniacs. They're also kings of showing off. And a poor film-making doesn't add anything to a very bad taste set.

And that we must take care to make amends for the brutality of life, because the universe is so much greater and more beautiful than we are.

It is slow, much slower than American movie goers have been trained to tolerate; elegiac, utterly alien to the the shoot-em-up, blow-em-up thesis of most internationally marketed American movies.  The scene with Alvin and his chance encounter with another WW II veteran is one of the most heartbreaking scenes in current cinema and is a poignant warning of what we are about to do in the current geopolitical climate. It is also a reminder of the finest aspects of the American soul - caring, compassion, kindliness, neighborliness.  Farnsworth and Spacek are superb.

Mulroney seemed at a complete loss of everything going on and Rpupert Everett seemed like the gay side-kick up for a goof. His part wasn't strong at all and his humor is a little...not humorous. It made you feel as if you should laugh without knowing why. A silly movie to kickback and watch, but once every blue moon when nothing else is on and there's no money to rent something.

The movie begins in an unusual way with an overture and colorful but indistinguishable art work on the screen.  Nothing is wrong with your DVD player or VCR.  The scene will come into focus after several minutes of listening to the musical overture.  The movie opens with interesting panoramic views of New York from the perspective of looking down on the city.  One gets the impression immediately that this could be a 'pretentious' film. And someimtes it is.  Humans show up on the concrete landscape of New York.  They are young men, apparently from rival gangs.  They dance, they sing, conveying their thoughts symbolically through dance and lyrically in song rather than through dialogue. Two policemen show up and there is some dialogue.  These are two rival gangs, one of white immigrants, and one of Puerto Rican immigrants.  Often, the two gangs seem more like rival dance troupes than genuine street gangs.  The two gangs, the Jets and the Sharks want to rumble.  A rumble is set up for the next night, after a community dance.  The leader of one gang tries to get his friend, Tony, who was a former leader to come back to the gang and fight in the rumble but Tony who now has a job wants nothing to do with it.  Tony even encourages the gang to fight with 'skin' and not use knives, rocks or guns.  At the dance, Tony meets and falls head over heals for Maria, the sister of the leader of the Puerto Rican gang.  The dance is amazing with unbelievably great dancing on display by members of both gangs.  The photography and special backgrounds are also terrific during the dance sequence.  Unfortunately, Maria's brother takes an immediate dislike to Tony who has dared to show an interst in his sister.  Maria naively talks Tony into going to the rumble to attempt to stop it, with disastrous results.  The movie is full of amazing and delightful dance sequences and tremendous songs.  The dramatic impact of this movie kicks into high gear when Maria's brother is killed by Tony at the rumble after killing Tony's best friend.  Both gangs are angry and are in a state of chaos as they scatter from the scene of the rumble.  Maria learns that Tony has killed her brother, yet in her sorrow and grief, still loves Tony. Maria plans to meet Tony and run away with him, but in a climactic scene, Tony is shot by the police and Maria embraces him while he dies.  It takes the death of Tony and the tears of Maria to bring the two rival gangs together and stop their hatred at least for the moment, and hopefully indefinitely.This is one of those movies that you must experience first hand to know what it is like.  It is definitely a musical, but it definitely not your average musical.  It may not be for all tastes, but to give it anything less than a 9 or 10 would be unfair because it is so unique and full of wonderful elements.  I thought that Moulin Rouge was a truly cutting edge and great musical, but I must admit that West Side Story was also innovative and daring, and made forty years before it.  You won't forget it after you've seen it, and songs and scenes will undoubtedly linger in your mind long after it ends.  Songs like America, Maria, Somewhere and Tonight are not easily forgotten.  The choreography is nothing short of spectacular!  This movie puts Chicago with Renee Zelweiger, Catherine Zeta Jones, and Richard Gere to shame, especially the dancing.  One wonders what all the hullabaloo about Chicago (2002) is for after seeing West Side Story.  The story within West Side Story is much more compelling and touching.  The songs are better.  Simply stated, West Side Story just works and gels together much better.  Watching West Side Story requires a commitment, though.  West Side Story is two and a half hours long.  The first half hour to hour of the movie may have you wondering if you like this movie or not the first time you see it.  But once this excellent film pulls you in to the world of the Jets, The Sharks, and their girls and once you buy into their reality, the intensity never lets up.

Russ Tamblyn is a firecracker.  Simon Oakland and Ned Glass are terrific in supporting roles.

The law was very clear that they must have their wings clipped and rendered flightless. When Jeremy tried, Tom kicked him out. Tom, David and their friend Barry perfected Tom's glider with an engine. But their idea try really didn't get off the ground. So they tried a bigger engine, which stalled in mid-air and sent Tom to another crashlanding. Goslings don't stay small forever. They grew and grew. Amy had even named them. One had a limp, which she wanted to name Gimpy but Dave suggested Igor. Amy experiences further frustrations when she and the goslings are in the shower and the soap dispenser malfunctions. Well, Tom never said he was perfect. He also knew that eventually the goslings would fly and without a mother to show them the way, they'd go off on their own and experience danger. If only there were a way to guide them. So Tom tried to get the geese to follow him around. It worked, but when he got into his little airplane. They followed no further. Many future attempts failed, but when Amy decided to fly solo in the aircraft, the geese followed!Tom then set to work designing another aircraft and taught Amy to fly it. Amy thought it was a wonderful idea. Tom sold his lunar module replica and purchased an aircraft motor. He put a giant goose statue on top of it and taught Amy piloting techniques. She mastered them quickly. Next Barry, Tom and David laid out a flight plan. David learned of a new sanctuary for the geese in Valhalla, Maryland. So they would set off on October 22nd and arrive there in four days but that's when Officer Jeremy showed up to cause trouble. He confiscated all of the geese, but thanks to some careful planning from David, the geese were set free and flew after Tom and Amy in their aircrafts. The trip went smoothly. Susan, David and Barry followed on the ground in a truck. The Air Force wasn't too pleased when they make a surprise stop on their air field, but they're quickly forgiven and soon arrive in New York. The news and media were all over them! They made news shows coast to coast! They were nearing Valhalla now. They nearly crashed into some Baltimore skyscrapers. But soon Tom ran into turbulence and crashed into a field. Amy would have to go it alone now. And she did it! The geese followed her all the way to the fields of Valhalla which would be permanently preserved for the wildlife and as luck would have it, the geese returned to Amy's front porch in the spring.This movie was okay. Not one of my personal favorites. I remember going to see it in the theaters. It's a tearjerker, I'll tell ya. Heck, in the scene when Amy remembers swinging on the tire swing as a toddler and her mother and her dog were there, I was about ready to cry myself. But anyway, Jeff Daniels was good, so was Anna Paquin! She won an Academy Award for a movie she did, I don't know which one exactly; This movie contains that Free Willy formula that has worked so well with so many movies. Originally, Fly Away Home was called Flying Wild. If you own an early video copy of Jumanji, you'll see a trailer for it being called Flying Wild and this is because when that little girl decided to fly solo in an airplane and she crashed and killed herself, the movie was put on hiatus. I guess while it was with-held, they decided Fly Away Home was a better title, but anyway, if you haven't seen it and are into a nice family movie, then Fly Away Home is yours! It will make your heart soar!- ","genre":null},{"date":"15 March 2003","score":"0 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":"  CONTAINS SPOILERSAmy Alden and her mother drove through the streets of New Zealand on a rainy night. Then all of a sudden, a truck came right for them. Amy's mom swerved to miss it and ended up tumbling off the road. Amy survived, but sadly her mother did not. Amy's estranged father, Tom, came to the hospital to take Amy to live with him on his farm in Ontario, Canada. Right away, Amy could tell she wouldn't be enjoying her stay. In the morning, she witnessed Tom trying out his hang glider. He soared through the air light as a feather then crashlanded in the field. Later that day Amy met Tom's lady friend, Susan. She didn't like her that much. Tom spent his time in the barn, which he had turned into a workshop. He's very good with metal. He's got a giant metal dragon as well as a lunar module replica! The next morning, a bulldozer knocked down a tree in some economics movement. Tom raced outside in his boxers to scream at the driver.
