EdTV has it's occasional chuckles but none of it really soars to the point in which we're entertained. The movie, in my opinion, just didn't work. Or not that well.Mconaghay is Ed, a guy that works in a video store. A television station(ran by Rob Reiner and Ellen Degeneres),which revolves around reality TV, needs a new TV reality star for an upcoming series. So, they find Ed, and he becomes the star.Ed,while being followed by his camera, discovers that his brother(played by Woody Harrelson) is having an affair behind his girlfriend's(Jenna Elfman) back. So Ed decides to woo her, and loses his brother's respect.As he soon learns, life onEDTV is tough. Such as he has to escape from his house in order for him to his girlfriend,and when they're having sex the camera crew catches them on TV. In which this causes problems on their relationship, along with the fact that the TV viewers don't like her.The majority of the characters are annoying. Excluding Ellen Degenres and Jenna Elfman. THe movie feels like it's unoriginal. Like it's a realistic version of The Truman show,without the substance. Without the brilliance.EDTV is also unbelievably slow and long. It's not very interesting,nor very funny. It's a bit of a mess. There's nothing really special about it. Ron Howard has done better. Watch the Grinch or Frost\/Nixon or something for good Howard.
