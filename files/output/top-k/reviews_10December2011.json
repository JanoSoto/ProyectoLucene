Stupid? Stupid is as stupid does. Forrest may be a little slow. But he gets life, he knows what's important. He remains true to himself, to his values. He is fiercely loyal to those he loves. And as Forrest himself says, though he is not a smart man he knows what love is. Just by doing what he knows in his heart to be right this simple man has the most incredible life. His journey is magical, inspiring, heartwarming. It's dramatic, it's funny, it's poignant, it's mesmerizing. Forrest Gump touches the lives of so many people around him. And along the way he changes the course of world events too. This is a life which has to be seen to be believed.So how does an Alabama boy with an IQ of 75 end up changing the world? Just by being himself. Life happens all around him and Forrest is often blissfully ignorant. He finds himself caught up in one extraordinary situation after another. In each situation, without fail, he just does the right thing, the good thing. He does what smarter people, given the opportunity to think about the situation, might not. He thinks not of the consequences, he just follows his heart. And that heart takes him to the most amazing places. He is a man driven by love. Love for his friends, for his mama, and above all for his beloved Jenny.The story of Forrest and Jenny is inspiring and tragic, heartwarming and heartbreaking all at the same time. From their first meeting as children the bond between these two is unbreakable. No matter how they may drift apart that connection is always there. And drift apart they do for while Forrest has his amazing life's journey Jenny has a journey all her own. She embraces life in her own way. In confronting her demons she makes some bad choices. No matter how far gone she may seem to be she knows, and we know, that Forrest will always be there for her. Forrest doesn't judge her as so many others would. He just loves her, always and forever, no matter how hard she makes it to love her at times. It really is one of the great relationships in movie history.The relationship between Forrest and Jenny is the real heart of the story but there's so much more. With everything Forrest experienced it's remarkable that director Robert Zemeckis managed to cram it all into less than two and a half hours of film. And give credit to Zemeckis too for creating the right tone for the film. In the wrong hands this could have been an overly sentimental mess of a film. But in Forrest Gump Zemeckis presents a film, and a character, which is good but not too good to be true. So many outrageous things happen to Forrest Gump but you believe in this story every step of the way. Zemeckis put all the pieces together perfectly. Everything fits, right down to the wonderful soundtrack with the perfect songs for each of the big moments in Forrest's decades-long journey. A great share of the credit for the film's success of course goes to Tom Hanks who played Forrest to perfection. An obviously challenging character to play. How far do you go in portraying Forrest's innate simplicity? Hanks got it just right. The rest of the cast is terrific as well. Robin Wright hits all the right emotional notes in playing the deeply troubled Jenny. Sally Field is everything you would want your mama to be. Mykelti Williamson brings great personality to the role of Forrest's wartime buddy Bubba. Michael Conner Humphreys and Hanna Hall are wonderfully endearing as the young Forrest and Jenny. And Gary Sinise is utterly brilliant in playing Lieutenant Dan, a character whose story arc is as dramatic and compelling as can be. Hanks of course won an Oscar for his performance, which was pretty much a given as soon as the film was released. That Sinise didn't pick up an Oscar as well for his supporting role seems borderline criminal. What a performance he gave in a supremely challenging role.Much was made upon the film's initial release about the effects used to insert Forrest Gump into history. The effects may seem quaint by now but they were truly revolutionary at the time. And they add a nice touch to the movie. It's cute seeing Forrest tell JFK he has to go pee or to see him chatting with John Lennon. All of Forrest's brushes with history give the movie a grander scale. They show the impact this very simple man had on the world. But for all the famous people he met, for all the wondrous things he did, Forrest would be the first to tell you that everything he ever needed was right there at home in Greenbow, Alabama. His friends, his mama, his Jenny. That's all Forrest Gump ever needed. And look at the impact he had on those closest to him, often without even trying. Look at where Lieutenant Dan is in life by the end of the film. Forrest got him there just by being himself, by doing what was right. And Forrest was of course always there for Jenny too. Such a simple man yet he touched so many lives. Not a smart man? Listen to what Forrest has to say about destiny in the incredibly poignant scene near the film's end.

He wrote and directed this one two years after his famous RUN LOLA RUN (1998) with the same star, the mesmerising Franka Potente. This one is set in his home town of Wuppertal, Germany. Miss Potente, as usual, is very potent indeed, so potent in fact that one is entirely spellbound just watching her to see what she will do next. This film is so unpredictable, so complex, so mysterious, that it might be described as 'Symbolist' (see Paul Valéry's essay 'The Existence of Symbolism' which he wrote in 1936). If I had been told it had a script by Stéphane Mallarmé, I would believe it. All the events are richly-textured, like a fine cheese which has just turned ripe. Who are all these people, and why do they behave as they do? Potente is a nurse at an insane asylum, but late in the story, when an exasperated Benno Fürmann says she is crazy, she answers with her eerie calmness 'Natürlich' ('Certainly'). In fact, we discover that she has been working in the asylum for years because her father is an inmate there. What she discovers about the true cause of the death of her mother is part of the surprises. She has long since ceased to be part of the real world. She claims to have been born in the asylum, and it is possible that she was. In any case, the film demonstrates that there are degrees of sanity and insanity, and where you draw the line can be subjective. The film consists of one shocking dramatic moment after another, and there are some frenetic running scenes as well, reminiscent of RUN LOLA RUN. Tykwer seems to love people who run.

Andrew Beckett, played by Tom Hanks, has the deadly disease; however, he chose not to tell his colleagues about his disease. Unfortunately, the partners of the firm suspect that he has AIDS after spotting a lesion on his forehead, and within days, Beckett is terminated. Beckett brings about a lawsuit with the help of Joe Miller, played by Denzel Washington. At first, Miller did not want to take the case. Not only did he not agree with homosexuality, but also he was hesitant to work so closely with someone who had the AIDS virus.The theme of the movie seems to be about discrimination, in addition to fear and ignorance to the unknown. Beckett was a future partner of the firm; yet, was quickly fired once the firm found out about his disease. After asking for help from at least nine lawyers, Beckett visited Miller and asked for his help. Miller and Beckett knew each other from a previous case and Miller welcomes Beckett with a handshake, until he found out about the disease. Miller quickly backed away from Beckett, stared at his lesions, and refused to take the case. In a later scene, Beckett is at the library and is asked by the librarian to sit away from everyone else. When Beckett refuses, all those around him left their seats. As we know, AIDS cannot be transmitted through handshakes or sitting next to someone with the disease; however, once someone found out about Beckett's disease, they quickly separated themselves from him.Homosexuality is referred to several times throughout the movie and this motif is the reason for the discrimination against Beckett. As in the movie Boys Don't Cry, Beckett tries to live a normal life and tries to keep his homosexuality a secret; however, once it is discovered that he is homosexual and has AIDS, characters in the movie express their opinion about his lifestyle. In one scene, Beckett expresses his feelings to Miller with the help of an opera song. This scene is a very powerful scene and uses a red glowing light to symbolize the hurt and pain that Beckett feels as a man with AIDS and his pain of the discrimination that he receives. It is in this scene that Miller sees Beckett as more than a gay man with AIDS, but as a human being with fears and thoughts just like his own.I definitely recommend watching this movie. It gives a real insight to the everyday discrimination of people that may be different from others, and their hardships they have to overcome. It gives me a better understanding of the quote, Don't judge a man until you have walked a mile in his boots.

I remember them well and I know I'm not alone. Most all of them have had superb careers and were leading men. The name that transcends them all is of course Henry Fonda; the coolest and most deliberate role was his and he owned it. I think of all the others as co-stars and not supporting actors. Lest we forget the directing by a master, Sidney Lumet, and camera crew as well as the grips who had to allow the story to flow without interfering; splendid work. I don't agree with some reviewers who state this sort of drama in one room is not and could not be done anymore; it was done magnificently in the 2010 movie The Sunset Limited with Tommy Lee Jones and Samuel L. Jackson; however that was only two men going back and forth with their arguments, and the script was worked from a successful play. I expanded on the qualities of it, in a review; the 1957 12 Angry Men is superior in a few ways. The dialogue is more difficult and requires very good direction and oddly, the one room also for stage for 'Sunset&#x85;' was bigger and allowed gesturing which '12 Angry Men' were limited in such acting resource.In '12 Angry Men' Fonda makes the profound arguments for the other jurors to take their responsibilities seriously because of the stakes. The story is a brilliant piece of work in the development of characters and principals and the flow of all that should be, actually gets there in a plausible flow. The audience is captivated by each juror's journey; that's classic drama\/thriller. The high ratings has been steady over time, which only means new audiences can appreciate good stuff.

I remember watching it quite a bit, but I always stayed behind for the extra short film put on the cassette; it was The Legend of Sleepy Hollow, narrated by Bing Crosby, and I'm pretty sure I thought this bonus short was better than the main feature. It was funny, spooky, and just plain entertaining. And it was later that I found out it was in its own movie.So what we have here is basically a cartoon double feature, with both cartoons being adaptations of classic stories. First we have The Wind in the Willows, narrated by Basil Rathbone. It's the classic story of Mr. Toad, a character who develops a mania for anything new and hot, and would give anything for the latest car model - even, perhaps, his mansion. It's a very well paced adventure with a brilliant voice choice for Toad (Eric Blore, most famous for playing the butler in the Fred Astaire-Ginger Rogers musical series), and some amusing supporting characters (I loved Cyril the Horse). On the whole it's a nicely done adaptation with a good climax and some pleasing animation.Then we have The Legend of Sleepy Hollow, the famous horror tale here narrated by Bing Crosby. While the previous cartoon was going more for charm, this one is edging more towards comedy, despite its story. It tells the tale of the mysterious disappearance of Ichabod Crane, a schoolmaster who attempts to marry a beautiful and rich woman in order to get her money. He's up against the school bully Brom Bones who also wants to marry her. But everything goes dark when Ichabod takes his horse down through the woods of Sleepy Hollow at night-time...The Legend of Sleepy Hollow is a macabre tale which manages to be both highly amusing and distinguishably Gothic, with Bing Crosby giving us his effortless charm, holding the story together brilliantly. Perhaps the most memorable moment is the climax, with the nightmarish Headless Horseman chasing the helpless Ichabod through the woods. The build-up of the Horseman is intensely creepy, and the reveal is no disappointment. Sleepy Hollow will give kids a good fright, but it's just about silly and light enough to prevent them from sleeping with the lights on.Really, kids will enjoy both stories. I myself prefer Sleepy Hollow, but only because I didn't watch The Wind in the Willows as a kid. They're both fun and kid-friendly, but there's nothing there to prevent grown- ups from liking them too. Overall it's a fun double bill with some excellent animation and superb voices, with both stories entertainingly told and working well back-to-back.

Ed Wood, a man without talent that loved cinema.Plan 9 from Outer Space is totally lame the screenplay is messy, with characters that do not have any development; the lines are awfully silly and stupid; there is an absolute lack of continuity, and sometimes the shot begins in the night, the next scene is in the sunlight and then it is night again. The scenarios are very poor and it is funny to see crosses shaking in the cemetery and other errors.

Therefore he could not afford to lose any shot and he used footages from the studios, like for example the sequence when the three flying sources are bombed by the army.

The one thing I do like about movies is that to rewatch them does not take anywhere near as much time as it does to re-read a book.This film is hardly original the cop that acts on instinct and is pretty much a loose cannon that gets results, and the setting of a cop going outside of his jurisdiction, and against orders, to investigate something that is personal to him. What makes this movie great is Eddie Murphy and the role he plays as a fast talking cop that is able to get what he needs simply through verbosity.One thing that stands out is how that contrast Beverley Hills with Detroit. Detroit is a dirty city with run down buildings and a busy and dilapidated police station. Beverley Hills is completely the opposite. While in Detroit you are after real criminals, the most that a Beverley Hills Cop does is to keep the peace. I note that on a number of occasions the cops are quick to arrest Foley (Eddie Murphy) and it is clear that he does not fit into this world.

It is about a Detroit cop who goes on 'vacation' to Beverley Hills to attempt to investigate the murder of a childhood friend, despite the fact that he is not allowed to. Beside watching it again because I had not seen it in a long time, I also noted that I have reviewed the third movie, but not the first and thus decided to rectify the situation. The one thing I do like about movies is that to rewatch them does not take anywhere near as much time as it does to re-read a book.This film is hardly original the cop that acts on instinct and is pretty much a loose cannon that gets results, and the setting of a cop going outside of his jurisdiction, and against orders, to investigate something that is personal to him. What makes this movie great is Eddie Murphy and the role he plays as a fast talking cop that is able to get what he needs simply through verbosity.One thing that stands out is how that contrast Beverley Hills with Detroit. Detroit is a dirty city with run down buildings and a busy and dilapidated police station. Beverley Hills is completely the opposite. While in Detroit you are after real criminals, the most that a Beverley Hills Cop does is to keep the peace. I note that on a number of occasions the cops are quick to arrest Foley (Eddie Murphy) and it is clear that he does not fit into this world. It is also interesting that because of the wealth and the reputation of Beverley Hills, it is almost inconceivable that its residents are criminals, at least to the police force. However, where there is money there is also corruption.The one thing that makes me raise my eyes is how Foley was intending on paying for his room at the hotel. It is clear through the movie that he cannot afford the $300US a night that they charge, and that is on top of all the added extras (such as sending food out to the cops who are watching Foley), though at the end the Beverley Hills Police end up picking up the tab (mighty generous of them, though I suspect that a lot of questions will be asked nonetheless).This is a heaps cool movie, and for those who have not seen it I would recommend watching it at least once.

Now, don't take me the wrong way, I don't believe the film is the worst thing out there. I have seen much worse, much better, but this film sets out to be one of the worst scenes out there. In the beginning, I thought the movie was unavailing pretty okay; all changing when he sets out to find the girl. The following, say, 45 minutes is a relationship status with Tom Cruise. They pointlessly drive in cars and crash each other until they go home and have sex. So... stupid. The way they inserted the action scenes was beyond me, they were so pointless and flaw...full. The second half, thankfully, had some redeeming qualities. The only I could find is the action and special effects, everything else was just horrible. Sadly, I found myself waiting for the movie to be over and watch the 3rd but I forced myself to see anything new. The acting, yeah, was pretty bad too.

I was surprised to see that my favorite composer, Hans Zimmer, constructed this disaster. They ruined the theme, one, by redoing it with a guitar. Sounds pretty cool, but sounds pretty not. Then the rest of the film has this (I'm trying to find the word) Hispanic (?) soundtrack. The film is a disgrace to the Mission Impossible films.

Basically Bob 'Bobby' Wiley (Bill Murray) is the good-natured but highly troubled man, he has multiple phobias, is very neurotic, and has ultimately irritated many doctors who try to treat him. The latest psychiatrist to be referred to him is New York based and egotistical Dr. Leo Marvin (Richard Dreyfuss), he quickly sees why Bob has got on so many doctors' nerves, he is unknowingly annoying, and as he is going on vacation with his family he for the moment refers him to his Baby Steps book. Bob tries to live with the advice of the book, but being highly reclusive, and seeing Leo as his hope for a better life, in desperation he takes the drastic action to use manipulation to find him while on vacation. He finds the doctor and his family, wife Fay (Airplane's Julie Hagerty), son Sigmund 'Siggy' (Hook's Charlie Korsmo) and daughter Anna (Kathryn Erbe) in a peaceful New Hampshire lakeside cottage. Leo is gradually becoming increasingly angered by Bob's constant intrusion, but his family are embracing the man who they say as just desperate for help, and they are charmed by his kind personality and sense of humour. The big reasons Leo doesn't want Bob around are because he is expecting a television crew to be visiting the house to interview him about his Baby Steps book, and of course his family seem to be spending more time with his patient. It comes to the day of the television interview, and Leo is humiliated by Bob appearing with him, the highly annoying man does give good face to his book, but of course the doctor is not as admired, and he really snaps with his patience. Leo has had enough of Bob, and truly going berserk he plans to kill Bob, and even though he was unaware that his family kindly told him to go, he takes Bob out into the woods, tying him up with explosives. After seeing this as some kind of treatment and way to see that he can go on without Bob returns to the house, after managing to untie himself, but he also left the explosives in the house, and in the end Leo only comes out of his catatonic state after Bob gets married to his sister Lily (Fran Brill). We are unsure how the rest of the story will pan out afterwards, but the final text also said that Bob was bringing out a book called Death Therapy, and that Leo was suing him for the rights. Also starring Tom Aldredge as Mr. Guttman, Susan Willis as Mrs. Guttman, Roger Bowen as Phil and Brian Reddy as Carswell Fensterwald, M.D. Like Caddyshack this is another completely different character for Murray, normally playing sarcastic and witty, here he is unknowingly funny and highly annoying to people and his antics cause chaos for Dreyfuss, who is also good as the control-freak doctor slowly going insane with hatred for him, it is a good simple concept of the slightly crazy patient turning his doctor crazy, and it makes for some good physical and dialogue jokes, a fun comedy.

It comes to the day of the television interview, and Leo is humiliated by Bob appearing with him, the highly annoying man does give good face to his book, but of course the doctor is not as admired, and he really snaps with his patience. Leo has had enough of Bob, and truly going berserk he plans to kill Bob, and even though he was unaware that his family kindly told him to go, he takes Bob out into the woods, tying him up with explosives. After seeing this as some kind of treatment and way to see that he can go on without Bob returns to the house, after managing to untie himself, but he also left the explosives in the house, and in the end Leo only comes out of his catatonic state after Bob gets married to his sister Lily (Fran Brill). We are unsure how the rest of the story will pan out afterwards, but the final text also said that Bob was bringing out a book called Death Therapy, and that Leo was suing him for the rights. Also starring Tom Aldredge as Mr. Guttman, Susan Willis as Mrs. Guttman, Roger Bowen as Phil and Brian Reddy as Carswell Fensterwald, M.D. Like Caddyshack this is another completely different character for Murray, normally playing sarcastic and witty, here he is unknowingly funny and highly annoying to people and his antics cause chaos for Dreyfuss, who is also good as the control-freak doctor slowly going insane with hatred for him, it is a good simple concept of the slightly crazy patient turning his doctor crazy, and it makes for some good physical and dialogue jokes, a fun comedy. Very good!

Basically Bob 'Bobby' Wiley (Bill Murray) is the good-natured but highly troubled man, he has multiple phobias, is very neurotic, and has ultimately irritated many doctors who try to treat him. The latest psychiatrist to be referred to him is New York based and egotistical Dr. Leo Marvin (Richard Dreyfuss), he quickly sees why Bob has got on so many doctors' nerves, he is unknowingly annoying, and as he is going on vacation with his family he for the moment refers him to his Baby Steps book. Bob tries to live with the advice of the book, but being highly reclusive, and seeing Leo as his hope for a better life, in desperation he takes the drastic action to use manipulation to find him while on vacation. He finds the doctor and his family, wife Fay (Airplane's Julie Hagerty), son Sigmund 'Siggy' (Hook's Charlie Korsmo) and daughter Anna (Kathryn Erbe) in a peaceful New Hampshire lakeside cottage.

Jack Nicholson is superb as McMurphy, a charismatic man that fakes mental illness to get out of jail, and instead ends up in a mental hospital. The head nurse in the hospital, Nurse Ratched, played wonderfully by Louise Fletcher is a hard, vindictive woman that is McMurphy's constant antagonist. Nicholson and Fletcher won the Oscar's for best actor and actress for this film, which also claimed Best Picture, and Best Director. The supporting cast was equally strong, especially Danny DeVito, Christopher LLoyd, and Will Sampson as Chief. McMurphy's different views and easy way begin to help the other patients progress. McMurphy grows more and more frustrated with Ratched's strict ways and defies her more and more until things come to a head and Nurse Ratched wins out. She has him lobotomized and turned into a vegetable. Chief mercifully kills his friend and escapes the hospital. The film is a sad, but important look into mental illness, the difficulties in treating it, and the failures of the system we had in place at the time. It is easily one of the best films of all time and despite the serious subject matter, it is a must see film.
