Aside from the follow up; the severely underrated Inferno, there really isn't another film like this one. Suspiria is often described as 'an all out assault on the senses', and while descriptions like this are often misguided and pretentious; that is not the case here. The pumping soundtrack courtesy of director Dario Argento's house band 'Goblin' interacts brilliantly with the colour scheme (borrowed from Walt Disney!) and the hallucinogenic chain of events to make a film that has a profound impact on an aesthetic level. Suspiria is definitely lacking in substance - but when the style element is so brilliantly done, who needs substance? The plot is like a modern day fairytale, and it follows a young girl by the name of Suzy Bannion, who travels to a German dance academy. From the moment she arrives, it soon becomes apparent that all is not quite right with the academy, and it isn't long before she's plunged into a world of witchcraft and murder, and decides to escape the academy.Suspiria is famous for it's gratuitous murder scenes, and, like the rest of the film - they don't disappoint. In fact, there is only three murder sequences in the film; the first being the one that attracts the most attention. Dario Argento directs as two girls are murdered simultaneously, and while the effects can be a little hokey, there's enough bright crimson blood to please any horror fan. The other two death sequences are extremely well orchestrated, and show great imagination. We get treated to a girl falling into a pit of barbed wire (...not everything here makes complete sense) and, best of all, a man eating dog! One that thing that Suspiria often receives criticism for is the fact that its plot is rather incoherent. This is a criticism that bears some weight, but I don't really see it as a flaw for the film. Suspiria isn't about plot details or making sense - it's a film that bypasses that stuff in favour of style and atmosphere, and it's these things that are always more important in a horror film. What Dario Argento and his co-writer (and girlfriend) Daria Nicoladia have done is cut out the less important elements and just given the audience what they turned up for. How can you criticise that? Suspiria is often mistaken for a slasher, and it receives a lot of criticism from people who have made this mistake. The murder scenes are few if you go into this film expecting a slasher, but it cannot be criticised for this because it isn't. Suspiria is hard to file into a certain genre or sub-genre; it's not quite Giallo, there's not enough witchcraft for it to be considered a witchcraft film, and it's certainly not a slasher; so since there's nothing else quite like it, I guess the film is in a category somewhere all on it's own. Dario Argento is often passed off as merely a splatter film director, but this couldn't be further from the truth. Argento movies get better with each viewing, and this is because repeated viewings enable to audience to fully appreciate the major talent that Dario Argento is. However, while his use of the camera is top notch; his ability to pull great performances out of his cast isn't. A few performers have turned in good performances in Argento films, but most don't and it seems that Argento doesn't care too much about acting in his films. Saying that, I don't care too much about it either.Suspiria is often regarded as Dario Argento's finest work, and it may well be. It's not my favourite Argento film; but it's up there, and when it comes to importance in the history of film, nothing else that the man ever made even comes close. Every horror fan needs to see the likes of The Exorcist and The Texas Chain Saw Massacre before they're a true fan; and Suspiria is certainly a member of that illusive list also.

Hellraiser is a brilliant horror film; forsaking all that makes most horror successful, Hellraiser is an endearing masterpiece, and one of the best films ever made. Barker showed promise as a director then, but Nightbreed was seriously lacking; and this film, Lord of Illusions, does nothing to get his credibility back on track. We kick off with a very trashy sequence that sees an illusionist get murdered, and I feared the worse; but after that, the film picks up into a sort of mystery plot, and things were looking up. This feeling of euphoria doesn't last long, however, because as soon as you realise that the mystery is one of the most poorly plotted ever; it becomes all too easy to get bored. The uneven plot has something to do with an illusionist who gives some power to someone called Swan and then gets killed by a young girl. Thirteen years later, a private detective is hired for some reason and we then stumble into a story about a rather odd cult.Basically, this movie is seriously flawed. Aside from the extremely messy plot, Lord of Illusions is also overlong, poorly acted and hard to follow. However, I cant give this a real low mark simply because I love the style that Barker has injected into the piece. We are constantly treated to a morbid atmosphere, which plays well with the plot - even if it is messy. The world of magic and illusionists hasn't been shown on screen too many times, and the film also gains credibility on the originality front for that. Nods towards Hellraiser, including the skin pealing from a man's bone, are well done and the film does actually feature quite a few memorable scenes. The special effects offer much in the way of good imagery, too. It's just a shame that the writer-director couldn't implement more of the good and less of the bad, as then this would really be a movie worth seeing. Casting Scott Bakula in the lead was a terrible idea as he has zero personality, and this makes the messy plot even harder to follow as sympathy for the main character is seriously repressed. Overall, Barker fans might find something to like here; but I have to say that this is one mundane flick.

I was so excited when I finally got my copy in the mail and all I can say is, What a disappointment. First the positives. Argento's use of bright colors and dark settings is a sort of eye candy that keeps you attentive. The murder scenes are rather gory though not too realistic looking by today's standards.

KRAMER was a big hit for everyone involved when it came out in 1979 as it won awards for Best Actor for Dustin Hoffman, Best Supporting Actress for Meryl Streep and Best Picture. This movie was also significant as it is probably the first major movie to deal with divorce; an unfortunate but common occurrence in every day life. KRAMER VS. KRAMER tells the story of Ted Kramer (Dustin Hoffman), an ad-executive who comes home one night only to find that his wife Joanna (Meryl Streep) is leaving him with their 7 year old son Billy (played by Justin Henry). The movie goes through the day to day events as Ted tries to care for Billy and hold down a job. However, no sooner do the father and son learn to deal with one another that Joanna comes back and wants her son back. Of course, this leads to a court case where the two fight to have the kid. As was often the case with divorces at the time (this took place in the late '70's), the judge sided with the mother. However, after Joanna won the case, she came to decide at the very end that Billy indeed should stay with his father.In viewing this movie and I have done so a number of times over the years, I feel this movie is kind of over-rated. Here are some of the flaws that I see in the film. First of all, in the very beginning of the movie, we see that Joanna is packing her suitcase and basically announces to Ted that she is leaving. She doesn't seem to know where she is going or anything. Also, there does not seem to be any build up. True, the movie starts that way but I kind of felt there should have been a real confrontation between the couple first. On his part, it seemed like he had no sense that his wife was about to leave him although it is true that Ted Kramer was portrayed to be totally obsessed with his work. Of course, as I mentioned before, the bulk of the film deals with Ted learning to bond with his son. Another problem I had was that when Ted lost his job, he got a new one in less than 24 hours. I realize that this was in the days before corporate downsizing laid people off in droves and it probably was not as hard to find another job that was self-supporting as it would be now. However, even back then, I don't think he would have found another job on a par of what he was doing (although it was considered a step-down for him) so fast despite his hustling for a new one. The movie does show that he was desperate to take ANY job at that point and it is true that when one is desperate, he or she will often do whatever it takes to get a new job. Anyway, I also had a problem with the way Ted conducted himself in the court scene when he was asked upsetting questions pertaining to how he made mistakes on the job and ultimately was let go. Granted, Ted was upset and rightfully so but I felt he should have handled himself better by keeping his answers short and not rambling on to defend his actions. As I mentioned before, at the time the movie took place, the judges almost always sided with the mother in a divorce but I do think the way Ted conducted himself may have contributed to why the judge went against him. Lastly, I felt that the ending did not seem plausible. At the end, Joanna, after winning the case, decided that her son did not belong with her but with his father instead. It did not make sense to me that she would have gone through all the trouble of fighting for custody only to say that her son did not belong with her although it was true that she did not really know what she wanted in her life. To me, a more realistic ending would have been that Billy went to live with his mother and that after work one day, Ted would go and pay a surprise visit to Billy. This would show Billy that while his father might not have full custody of him, his father would continue to be an important person in his life.In reading the comments I have just given, one might conclude that I did not like the film. That's not the case. It's just that I was pointing out what did not seem right to me. However, I did like the movie in the sense that some years ago, I took the time to buy a video-tape of it. Also, I enjoyed some of the scenes including where Ted makes French toast with his son. The scene where they do so after the trial showed how much closer they were from the beginning of the movie. Another scene worth mentioning is the famous one where the woman Ted is dating is staying over and Billy asks her (while she is naked) Do you like fried chicken? as it showed how cute and innocent he (Billy) really was. Overall, the movie did a good job of showing how Ted and his son bonded as there were scenes where they read together etc. I would say that was probably the strongest aspect of the film.

","genre":"Horror, Mystery"},{"date":"31 October 2005","score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" This is, I think, the first of Leone's true masterpieces, and quite possibly Leone's most watchable film. A Fistful of Dollars is a great film revolutionary, gritty, violent, and fun, and it certainly was the true beginning of a monumental change in westerns. However, this is the first film where Leone's brilliance fully comes to the front. On the other hand, while not quite as famous (in the English-speaking world) as the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly (GBU) and perhaps not quite as great a cinematic achievement as GBU or Once Upon a Time in the West (OUTIW), this film is nevertheless not far behind those clear masterpieces.The characteristic Leone visual style and incredible artistry are very powerful here. Although some of this is evident in small amounts in the previous film, here we really get to see the incredible, revolutionary close-ups and the contrast between close-ups and long shots. These and other images are powerful and beautiful. The film also brings the deliberate pacing and wonderful, almost unbearable, build-up of tension before quick action. Leone's sense of irony and brilliant weaving together of various motifs and symbols (particularly religious) also comes to the forefront in this film, as does the humour.The story is more complex than before, and more emotional and profound than GBU or OUTIW. Not until Duck, You Sucker! does Leone really delve more into emotions and psyches more than here, which gives this film an added depth and power. The scenes showing Indio's psyche, obsession, and mental decay are also powerful and perfect. Some (including Leone himself, apparently) feared that Volonte was overacting a tad, while others point out how the flashbacks are supposedly inaccurate portrayals of the effects of marijuana, however, this all works incredibly well. Volonte is quite convincing as a criminal sinking into a form of psychosis and obsessed with personal demons of the past and the flashbacks work brilliantly at hitting this theme home, creating an powerful, surreal, mournful, and lonely eeriness that, although it is not clear at first, perfectly parallels Mortimer's own despair and quest.The the way in which the story progresses, and brings the three main characters together, is brilliant. The introductions of the characters to how Mortimer and Manco focus on the same bandit (Indio), but with the reason for the interests rather subtly and vaguely indicated from the start, to how Mortimer and Manco duel before joining forces (sort of) is perfect. The music here, while similar to, and less famous than, the score for GBU, is also simply incredible. Just as this film reveals the first full flowering of Leone's gifts, it is also the first full flowering of Morricone's abilities and style introduced in the prior film. The score is in fact just as incredible as Morricone's subsequent ones and it excels at creating a sense of loneliness, despair, mournfulness, and eeriness in a way the even GBU doesn't and which fewof his other scores have. The only scores of his that I can think of which match or excell it on this point Once Upon a Time in America (at least with respect to despair, mourning, and loneliness), The Great Silence, OUTIW (but the harmonica music only) and The Untouchables (in despair and eeriness). This score thus perfectly conveys the atmosphere of the lonely, unpleasant towns, the lonely, harsh life of the bounty hunters, the harshness of the outlaws and Indio's increasingly crazed mind, and Mortimer's despair and personal quest. Finally, we for the first time get to see Lee van Cleef in a first role and he is simply outstanding. He handles the role so well, it's hard to imagine that he had nothing even approaching this magnitude before. This film really has no real faults, the only ones being a few technical errors such as the discrepancy in the wanted poster that Mortimer slides under the door near the beginning. However, these are tiny, most people won't notice, and no-one should really care about them. They are also problems that vanished in Leone's later films where he had more time and more money. In terms of length and pacing, this is also one of Leone's shorter, faster-paced films. Only a Fistful of Dollars and Duck, You Sucker! compare in those terms. This can be good, or bad, depending on the person, interests, or mood. Personally, Leone's longer masterpieces are my favourites, but sometimes even I don't have the time or patience to sit through their relatively slow development (and I am someone who can watch the 3.75-hour Once Upon A Time in America over and over) and want the quicker pace, action, and wit of this film. Also, certainly for some people this movie will be better suited on this point and those who find GBU or OUTIW to be a tad long should opt for this. It certainly is one of the two most lively and fun of Leone's films (the other being the longer GBU).

A Fistful of Dollars is a great film revolutionary, gritty, violent, and fun, and it certainly was the true beginning of a monumental change in westerns. However, this is the first film where Leone's brilliance fully comes to the front. On the other hand, while not quite as famous (in the English-speaking world) as the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly (GBU) and perhaps not quite as great a cinematic achievement as GBU or Once Upon a Time in the West (OUTIW), this film is nevertheless not far behind those clear masterpieces.The characteristic Leone visual style and incredible artistry are very powerful here. Although some of this is evident in small amounts in the previous film, here we really get to see the incredible, revolutionary close-ups and the contrast between close-ups and long shots. These and other images are powerful and beautiful. The film also brings the deliberate pacing and wonderful, almost unbearable, build-up of tension before quick action. Leone's sense of irony and brilliant weaving together of various motifs and symbols (particularly religious) also comes to the forefront in this film, as does the humour.The story is more complex than before, and more emotional and profound than GBU or OUTIW. Not until Duck, You Sucker! does Leone really delve more into emotions and psyches more than here, which gives this film an added depth and power. The scenes showing Indio's psyche, obsession, and mental decay are also powerful and perfect. Some (including Leone himself, apparently) feared that Volonte was overacting a tad, while others point out how the flashbacks are supposedly inaccurate portrayals of the effects of marijuana, however, this all works incredibly well. Volonte is quite convincing as a criminal sinking into a form of psychosis and obsessed with personal demons of the past and the flashbacks work brilliantly at hitting this theme home, creating an powerful, surreal, mournful, and lonely eeriness that, although it is not clear at first, perfectly parallels Mortimer's own despair and quest.The the way in which the story progresses, and brings the three main characters together, is brilliant. The introductions of the characters to how Mortimer and Manco focus on the same bandit (Indio), but with the reason for the interests rather subtly and vaguely indicated from the start, to how Mortimer and Manco duel before joining forces (sort of) is perfect. The music here, while similar to, and less famous than, the score for GBU, is also simply incredible. Just as this film reveals the first full flowering of Leone's gifts, it is also the first full flowering of Morricone's abilities and style introduced in the prior film. The score is in fact just as incredible as Morricone's subsequent ones and it excels at creating a sense of loneliness, despair, mournfulness, and eeriness in a way the even GBU doesn't and which fewof his other scores have. The only scores of his that I can think of which match or excell it on this point Once Upon a Time in America (at least with respect to despair, mourning, and loneliness), The Great Silence, OUTIW (but the harmonica music only) and The Untouchables (in despair and eeriness). This score thus perfectly conveys the atmosphere of the lonely, unpleasant towns, the lonely, harsh life of the bounty hunters, the harshness of the outlaws and Indio's increasingly crazed mind, and Mortimer's despair and personal quest.

This film being from MGM, there was a lot of money put into it. Like said before, the makers got the clothing and weapons from the red army right. I liked how there was Cubans and Nicaraguans as well as Russians. The action was top-notch for 1984. Some people said that the teenagers were like card board cut-outs. I disagree, i think u did see them change in character in many ways. Like when the kid shoots Daryl with the AK after finding out Daryl betrayed them. It shows how even tho they did not know too well how Daryl got caught, the kid shot him (his friend) This shows their hatred. another time when Lea Thompson hates Charlie Sheen for being i guess kind of sexist, but then when they separate she hugs him n all. I know this movie was meant to tell a story of a certain are in America. But i wish it was brought out in a more worldly view. e.g. Tells more about the background, the reasons why. Sometimes like when the pilot says to the kids when u have two toughest kids on the street there gonna fight one day. I mean thats retarded, just a lame way to get around explaining y Russia invaded. That was the biggest mistake of the movie. Also i enjoyed how they showed the Cuban Colonal Bella changing throughout the movie. lol then the Russians are seen as cold blooded and fight to their death. They should have shown more about their invaders and there thoughts on it. i gave it a 7 because it hits the right spot many times but this area has so much more potential, wow if I'm ever a director I'm def doing a movie like this. ALSO if anyone here likes this movie and has playstation u should buy it, the game FREEDOM FIGHTERS, its in my opinion top 3 games of all time PS2.

The script by Pierce Gardner is as dull as dishwater, dialogue driven rather than action & just rips off ideas & themes from far better films like The Exorcist (1973) & The Omen (1976). Everything you would expect is here at some point, an exorcism, crucifixes, possession, hallucinations & just everyone in sight questioning their beliefs & religion, yawn. To make matters worse, much worse, is the fact that Lost Souls is slow, bland, forgettable, dull & ultimately a complete waste of 100 odd minutes. I only saw it mere hours ago & I'm struggling to remember half of it, the story itself had potential I suppose but it just plods along in a very unexciting fashion until it's awful ending, I mean would you shoot someone dead because a car dashboard clock read 6.66?

I don't even want to think about Lost Souls anymore & the fact that it sat on the shelf for over a year before the studio finally had the courage to release it should say something in itself. One area where Lost Souls does impress is with it's visual style & look, Kaminski is obviously a cinematographer as he spends far more time on how the film looks than trying to entertain the audience, anyway Lost Souls looks fabulous with bleached out colours that make it almost black and white, Kaminski loves his rays & shafts of light as they are everywhere & he throws in various tricks & cool camera angles to keep things interesting, on a visual level anyway. With a budget of about $28,000,000 I was amazed at how cheap Lost Souls feels, apart from the cinematography it has nothing going for it. The setting is dull as is the music & general feel throughout. The acting was OK but I didn't particularly care for anyone which was a big problem with a character driven film such as this. Forget about any blood, gore or special effects as there aren't any.

There are plenty of shocking and disturbing moments, and Scatman Crothers is really excellent in his role!, plus Stanley Kubrick's direction is absolutely masterful!. I never did really get the ending, but always did find it fascinating, and, i feel this is one of the best horror films ever made!, plus Philip Stone(Delbert Grady) and Joe Turkel(Lloyd), both give extremely chilling performances!. The guy in the bear suit at the end truly disturbed me, and i agree with the people that said Jack has always been the care taker at the hotel, just reincarnated each time (at least that's what most people say), plus i must give credit to Shelley Duvall for doing such a great job!. This is a definite classic Horror film, it's scary and still packs a very powerful punch Jack Nicholson is incredible!, and if you haven't seen it do so immediately you won't regret it!, it's one of the best Horror films ever made. The Direction is masterful!. Stanley Kubrick does a masterful job here, with incredible camera work, stunning angles, great zoom in's and zoom out's good POV shots, creating a lot of creepy atmosphere, using one of the most creepiest settings in Horror history!, and lots of other amazing shots as well!, plus he kept the film at an extremely fast pace!. There is a bit of blood and violence we get. Gallons and gallons and gallons of blood,corpses, that have been chopped up, a creepy, rotting old lady, nasty rotting corpses, Axe in the chest, and other minor stuff, but we didn't really need it.The Acting is incredible!. Jack Nicholson is amazing as always, and is simply incredible here!, he is extremely frightening, unpredictable, totally OTT (and i loved it!!), gives one of the best performances ever(In my opinion),and you can clearly see that he isn't normal right from the very beginning, he is also incredibly chilling in the finale, a spectacular performance indeed!, he was incredible. (Nicholson Rules!!!!). Shelley Duvall is excellent here with what she had to do, she showed lots of fear and vulnerability, and was very likable, i liked her lots. Danny Lloyd gives one of the best child performances i have ever seen, he is simply chilling, and to think he only acted twice in a movie!, simply amazing, he also had some memorable creepy lines!. Scatman Crothers gave a great show here, i just wished he had more screen time, a very classy performance indeed!. Philip Stone gives an extremely chilling performance as Delbert Grady,and seriously deserves more credit for his wonderful performance here!. Joe Turkel is very creepy as Lloyd the Bartender, i loved him, he also deserves more credit. Rest of the cast are fine.

The guy in the bear suit at the end truly disturbed me, and i agree with the people that said Jack has always been the care taker at the hotel, just reincarnated each time (at least that's what most people say), plus i must give credit to Shelley Duvall for doing such a great job!. This is a definite classic Horror film, it's scary and still packs a very powerful punch Jack Nicholson is incredible!, and if you haven't seen it do so immediately you won't regret it!, it's one of the best Horror films ever made. The Direction is masterful!. Stanley Kubrick does a masterful job here, with incredible camera work, stunning angles, great zoom in's and zoom out's good POV shots, creating a lot of creepy atmosphere, using one of the most creepiest settings in Horror history!, and lots of other amazing shots as well!, plus he kept the film at an extremely fast pace!. There is a bit of blood and violence we get. Gallons and gallons and gallons of blood,corpses, that have been chopped up, a creepy, rotting old lady, nasty rotting corpses, Axe in the chest, and other minor stuff, but we didn't really need it.The Acting is incredible!. Jack Nicholson is amazing as always, and is simply incredible here!, he is extremely frightening, unpredictable, totally OTT (and i loved it!!), gives one of the best performances ever(In my opinion),and you can clearly see that he isn't normal right from the very beginning, he is also incredibly chilling in the finale, a spectacular performance indeed!, he was incredible. (Nicholson Rules!!!!). Shelley Duvall is excellent here with what she had to do, she showed lots of fear and vulnerability, and was very likable, i liked her lots. Danny Lloyd gives one of the best child performances i have ever seen, he is simply chilling, and to think he only acted twice in a movie!, simply amazing, he also had some memorable creepy lines!. Scatman Crothers gave a great show here, i just wished he had more screen time, a very classy performance indeed!. Philip Stone gives an extremely chilling performance as Delbert Grady,and seriously deserves more credit for his wonderful performance here!. Joe Turkel is very creepy as Lloyd the Bartender, i loved him, he also deserves more credit. Rest of the cast are fine.

I am one of those viewers duly recognizing the eternal genius of Hitchcock--and The Birds is right up there with the best of his films. For film magic to really take effect--one of course has to suspend disbelief. And while there are moments that I quibble with in each of his films in terms of common sense or in terms of the way people would really talk or react in the given situations--with The Birds there are so many more of those moments. OK--here goesWhat I love about The Birds 1. that famous scene of the birds circling down from the heavens over the burning gas station. 2. The great schoolyard scene--what a visual jolt the first time both Melanie Daniels and the viewer sees the full scope of the perched birds. (In that scene I even like that dumb song the kids are singing--I could sing it right now!!) 3. At the end of the scene where the family, in their own household cage, are surrounded by the frightening sounds of the bird attacks, and each character comes into view with the camera down below looking up at their eerily lit and haunted visage. Disorienting and Intriguing as could be. 4. The variety of the bird attacks--no two are the same--each one grows in intensity--and is so singular. One doesn't really prepare the viewer for the next one. 5. The electronic score. Mesmerizing--right from the word Go! 6. That well-needed moment of repose in the seaside diner with the assorted town characters all chattering away. We're in the middle of a cataclysm, in the middle of our roller-coaster ride, but we enjoy the humor, irony, and sort of comfort of these people all gathered together. (We would not want to be alone during an attack like this--we crave human contact.) 7. The beautiful visuals--whether of the ride up the coastal highway, or the curving Bodega Bay, or the School's majestic position on the hill. 8. The final, eerie landscape of the birds in closeup around the house--to an infinite distance. 9. The intriguing ending--leaving it all up to our imagination as to what happens--and making us want to see the film all over again to search for clues to what indeed happens. 10. Hitchcock's genuinely funny appearance at the beginning walking out the store with his two funny white dogs. Incongruous and adorable.What I find annoying about The Birds 1. I'm sorry-- I know, I know--the opening helps set the mood, and there is lots of symbolism, and lots of Red Herrings as to where the plot might go--but it is still too damn long before anything good happens! 2. Some of the acting is just execrable. Tippi Hedron is beautiful--but that voice!! 3. The whiny kids! They had me rooting for the birds sometimes. 4. Why does Melanie leave the diner for the phone booth? Oh--the visuals in the phone booth are spectacular. But why did she do that? 5. Why does Mitch spend ALL that time hammering wooden boards onto the outside windows of his house, when he should have just taken his family and gotten the Heck out of there? (Of course that would have deprived us of some additional spectacular scenes.) But it just seems silly what he is doing. 6. The sound of Cathy throwing up. (As she delicately coughs a couple of times. If you listen really hard--you do hear the sound of a bit of a throw-up sound--but that may be wishful thinking! I say its just coughing!!) 7. Lydia's character. What an annoying human being. 8. Mitch's opening nastiness to Melanie. Melanie has to have real co- dependency issues to be drawn to him after that unpleasant exchange! I didn't buy it. 9. Some awkward camera shots--when the car explodes in flames, there are three frozen scenes of Teppi Hedron looking from her right to her left--it looks sort of silly. Also, the cook at the end of this scene suddenly runs in saying that the birds are leaving after everyone has already accepted that fact. It comes out inadvertently funny. 10. Cathy's immortal line Why are they doing this....the birds? It's a classic and a great movie, and who knows? Maybe some of the lesser moments adds to its classic, unforgettable reputation. I've seen this film more times than I can count--and if it were on tonight--I'd watch it again!

At the end of the scene where the family, in their own household cage, are surrounded by the frightening sounds of the bird attacks, and each character comes into view with the camera down below looking up at their eerily lit and haunted visage. Disorienting and Intriguing as could be. 4. The variety of the bird attacks--no two are the same--each one grows in intensity--and is so singular. One doesn't really prepare the viewer for the next one. 5. The electronic score. Mesmerizing--right from the word Go! 6. That well-needed moment of repose in the seaside diner with the assorted town characters all chattering away. We're in the middle of a cataclysm, in the middle of our roller-coaster ride, but we enjoy the humor, irony, and sort of comfort of these people all gathered together. (We would not want to be alone during an attack like this--we crave human contact.) 7. The beautiful visuals--whether of the ride up the coastal highway, or the curving Bodega Bay, or the School's majestic position on the hill. 8. The final, eerie landscape of the birds in closeup around the house--to an infinite distance. 9. The intriguing ending--leaving it all up to our imagination as to what happens--and making us want to see the film all over again to search for clues to what indeed happens. 10. Hitchcock's genuinely funny appearance at the beginning walking out the store with his two funny white dogs. Incongruous and adorable.What I find annoying about The Birds 1. I'm sorry-- I know, I know--the opening helps set the mood, and there is lots of symbolism, and lots of Red Herrings as to where the plot might go--but it is still too damn long before anything good happens! 2. Some of the acting is just execrable. Tippi Hedron is beautiful--but that voice!! 3. The whiny kids! They had me rooting for the birds sometimes. 4. Why does Melanie leave the diner for the phone booth? Oh--the visuals in the phone booth are spectacular. But why did she do that? 5. Why does Mitch spend ALL that time hammering wooden boards onto the outside windows of his house, when he should have just taken his family and gotten the Heck out of there? (Of course that would have deprived us of some additional spectacular scenes.) But it just seems silly what he is doing. 6. The sound of Cathy throwing up. (As she delicately coughs a couple of times. If you listen really hard--you do hear the sound of a bit of a throw-up sound--but that may be wishful thinking! I say its just coughing!!) 7. Lydia's character. What an annoying human being. 8. Mitch's opening nastiness to Melanie. Melanie has to have real co- dependency issues to be drawn to him after that unpleasant exchange! I didn't buy it. 9. Some awkward camera shots--when the car explodes in flames, there are three frozen scenes of Teppi Hedron looking from her right to her left--it looks sort of silly. Also, the cook at the end of this scene suddenly runs in saying that the birds are leaving after everyone has already accepted that fact. It comes out inadvertently funny. 10. Cathy's immortal line Why are they doing this....the birds? It's a classic and a great movie, and who knows? Maybe some of the lesser moments adds to its classic, unforgettable reputation. I've seen this film more times than I can count--and if it were on tonight--I'd watch it again! ","genre":"Horror"},{"date":"31 October 2005","score":"","review":" Each time I see The Birds I am enthralled. And yet each time I get annoyed. I am one of those viewers duly recognizing the eternal genius of Hitchcock--and The Birds is right up there with the best of his films. For film magic to really take effect--one of course has to suspend disbelief. And while there are moments that I quibble with in each of his films in terms of common sense or in terms of the way people would really talk or react in the given situations--with The Birds there are so many more of those moments. OK--here goesWhat I love about The Birds 1. that famous scene of the birds circling down from the heavens over the burning gas station. 2. The great schoolyard scene--what a visual jolt the first time both Melanie Daniels and the viewer sees the full scope of the perched birds.

To be honest, I love thrillers like this as they offer a solid two hours (or so) of non-too taxing entertainment, and what's not to like about that? A Perfect Murder is an update of the Hitchcock classic 'Dial M For Murder', and while the film doesn't touch Hitchcock's in terms of how thrilling it is, this update has been well handled and despite losing things such as the claustrophobia and the tight plot, A Perfect Murder still does what you'd expect it to do. The plot has become more expansive for this update, but the filmmakers have still managed to keep it tight so that the plot is focused mainly on the characters as opposed to the actual crime. The plot follows a rich man (Michael Douglas) who discovers that his trophy wife (Gweneth Paltrow) is having an affair with an artist (Viggo Mortensen). When his business affairs start to go awry, he decides to commit the perfect murder so that he can inherit his wife's trust fund. However, as all of us Hitchcock fans know; there's no such thing as the perfect murder.Michael Douglas was the absolute perfect choice for this role. He may get typecast as the slimy businessman often, but he does it so well! You can really believe that he wants to kill his wife. Gweneth Paltrow, who is often solid but never outstanding; and Viggo Mortensen, who is actually a good actor, join him and make up the three-piece central cast. Mortensen's performance here isn't awesome; but it's good, and hints at the sort of stuff that would be to come - such as a great turn in David Cronenberg's A History of Violence. Like most nineties thrillers, this one is very stylishly shot and there's a focus on the more steamy elements of the story. The locations used aptly convey the groups within society that the characters belong to and the film does a good job of setting its scenes. The central set piece is well executed, and the build up to it is well done also; but it has to be said that the film starts to fall apart a little after that. Still, A Perfect Murder never becomes boring and even during it's down time; the film still manages to be thrilling. As mentioned, this isn't as great as Hitchcock's version - but as modern remakes go - this certainly isn't a bad one, and I recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good thriller.
