SPOILERS EVERYWHERE!The beginning of The Godfather is both horrifying and engrossing. The first shot is in a dark room, as a man speaks to Vito Corleone (Brando) of an appalling attempted rape on his daughter. The criminals have escaped American justice, but he wants (what he considers) real justice to be done. As it is his daughter's wedding day, Corleone (as a Sicilian) mustn't refuse a reasonable request. And thus, the opening scene of the film plunges the viewer directly into what is one of the most respected movies of all time.And yet, as effective as this move is, it can also be extremely confusing. As a non-Italian viewer, the sudden immersion into Italian culture created a disconcerting effect.Thankfully, for a film that is nearly three hours long, The Godfather has plenty of action going on, spanning 10 years, yet rarely becoming boring. Unfortunately, when it does become boring, it is because Coppola falls into the trap he fell into with Apocalypse Now too much side material makes the plot irrelevant. His muddled concept of suspense at times left me completely bored. The Mafia is often treated as a bureaucracy, with men in tight suits pledging loyalty to each other, then promptly killing each other. Many of these scenes end up being ineffective.Incidentally, it is curious that although the central characters of The Godfather are members of the Mafia, the viewer somehow sympathises with them. Why? I believe I've found the answer. We never see the individual victims of crime. We never see women reduced to prostitution, a family broken up by gambling, drugs ruining a man's life. The only cop we see with speaking lines is corrupt, and promptly killed off. Although the characters are, at heart, immoral, the effects of their immorality are limitedly shown. And this might be why the characters have such appeal instead of gangsters, they become a dysfunctional family. Thus, The Godfather, often dismissed as a thriller, is most aptly classified as a drama.For me, one of the (if not the) best scenes in the entire film is when Michael (Pacino) attends his sister's son's baptism, where he stands as the godfather. As the priest asks him whether he renounces Satan and all his works (etc.), Michael answers I do. In a masterfully inter-cut scene (kudos to Coppola), this moment of the baptism is shown to take place simultaneously as several murders Michael has arranged. The juxtaposition of these two moments is highly effective (much more so, in my humble opinion, than the brutal execution of Carlo minutes later), and is one of the moments that make The Godfather the oh-so-sweet treat it is.However, despite being one of the most respected movies of all time, The Godfather undeniably is flawed (gasps!). There are so many characters to keep track of, that several of them remain sketched-in shadows. In addition, Coppola has thrown in a subplot about Michael's life in Sicily after he flees America, which is not only ineffective, but also slows down the tone of the film, and brings in doubts over just how much Michael loves his wife, a situation affirmed when he lies to her at the film's end, denying his involvement in the murders. It just feels stiff, awkward, out-of-place, and slows down the film. And of course, I think that Michael ordering his sister's husband to be killed is possibly the film's biggest flaw. Michael shows positively no concern for Connie his only thought is to avenge his brother. Well, this relentless circle of vengeance gets dizzying at times.When it comes to acting, there's practically no argument. The Godfather is one of the best-cast films ever. Marlon Brando in particular works well. (Nay, I'll revise that-- he IS the Godfather.) His final scene, as he dies playing with his grandson, works precisely because of Brando's acting.The score for The Godfather was composed by Nino Rota, and a very effective score it was! The theme in particular seemed to melancholically say If only we had listened to the Godfather&#x85; Finally, I find it fascinating how, with subtlety, later events in the film are foreshadowed. The most brilliant case of foreshadowing occurs when a film studio boss (whose name completely escapes me) shows off his prize horse, boasting of its price and how he plans not to race it. This serves as such a clever way of foreshadowing the (gruesome, yet effective) slaughter of the horse.The Verdict Although The Godfather is undeniably a very good movie, it has been overrated, emphasis put on its good points, yet its flaws shockingly overlooked.

Thus, The Godfather, often dismissed as a thriller, is most aptly classified as a drama.For me, one of the (if not the) best scenes in the entire film is when Michael (Pacino) attends his sister's son's baptism, where he stands as the godfather. As the priest asks him whether he renounces Satan and all his works (etc.), Michael answers I do. In a masterfully inter-cut scene (kudos to Coppola), this moment of the baptism is shown to take place simultaneously as several murders Michael has arranged. The juxtaposition of these two moments is highly effective (much more so, in my humble opinion, than the brutal execution of Carlo minutes later), and is one of the moments that make The Godfather the oh-so-sweet treat it is.However, despite being one of the most respected movies of all time, The Godfather undeniably is flawed (gasps!). There are so many characters to keep track of, that several of them remain sketched-in shadows. In addition, Coppola has thrown in a subplot about Michael's life in Sicily after he flees America, which is not only ineffective, but also slows down the tone of the film, and brings in doubts over just how much Michael loves his wife, a situation affirmed when he lies to her at the film's end, denying his involvement in the murders. It just feels stiff, awkward, out-of-place, and slows down the film. And of course, I think that Michael ordering his sister's husband to be killed is possibly the film's biggest flaw. Michael shows positively no concern for Connie his only thought is to avenge his brother. Well, this relentless circle of vengeance gets dizzying at times.When it comes to acting, there's practically no argument. The Godfather is one of the best-cast films ever. Marlon Brando in particular works well. (Nay, I'll revise that-- he IS the Godfather.) His final scene, as he dies playing with his grandson, works precisely because of Brando's acting.The score for The Godfather was composed by Nino Rota, and a very effective score it was! The theme in particular seemed to melancholically say If only we had listened to the Godfather&#x85; Finally, I find it fascinating how, with subtlety, later events in the film are foreshadowed. The most brilliant case of foreshadowing occurs when a film studio boss (whose name completely escapes me) shows off his prize horse, boasting of its price and how he plans not to race it. This serves as such a clever way of foreshadowing the (gruesome, yet effective) slaughter of the horse.The Verdict Although The Godfather is undeniably a very good movie, it has been overrated, emphasis put on its good points, yet its flaws shockingly overlooked. It's currently #2 on IMDb's Top 250-- but it should, in my humble opinion, be a lot further down the list.Overall Rating 6.5\/10 ","genre":"Crime, Drama"},{"date":"4 June 2009","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Nineteen year-old Harold is pampered to death by his rich mother.

His idea of a decent time is attending random funerals. He is a loner and bored with life even though he hasn't truly lived it.....that is of course, until he meets a reckless old woman named Maude.

The performances were nothing less than flawless, and the atmosphere of the story, brought to life by a combination of hauntingly beautiful music and being shot in black-and-white, is other-worldy. I will break down every aspect of The Elephant Man so that I can explain exactly how this movie made me feel.1.) Jon Hurt plays the eponymous lead, Joseph Merrick, a sufferer of Proteus Syndrome who is flaunted as a sideshow freak. Rescued by Dr. Frederick Treves (Anthony Hopkins,) Merrick is shown humanity and that there are those in the world who will see him for his inner beauty, rather than his outer deformations. Hurt's performance in the film, which was nominated for an Oscar but did not win (unbelievable,) was moving on so many levels. The most prominent of course is his sheer inability to comprehend the cruelty he is faced with; this is expressed in the infamous line, I am not an animal! I am a human being! I swear to God, I cried my eyes out.2.) Anthony Hopkins plays Frederick Treeves, an English doctor who treats and befriends Merrick after rescuing him from the circus. Treves is the symbol of the essential goodness in people. Anthony Hopkins is one of my favorite actors of all time, partly because of this role and partly because of his portrayal of Hannibal Lecter (Yes, that's right, the infamous Hannibal the Cannibal.) Treves is one of the few, and possibly the only person to show genuine affection for Merrick in the film.3.)The opening theme of the film gave me an unusual feeling. I wasn't sure how i was going to feel about the rest of the movie; it gave me a sort of hollow, foreboding sense. The eerie circus music also sent an additional shiver up my spine.4.) The most emotional scenes in the film, all of which obviously center themselves around Merrick, are as follows 1. The scene in Joseph's bedroom when a group of drunken criminals break in and assault him, throwing him around and lifting off the ground, all the while circus music plays in the background.2. The chase through the train station, when an exasperated Merrick is run down by a crowd of angry onlookers. He is backed into a corner with, his malformed face exposed, and exclaims I am not an animal! I am a human being! I... am a... man! 3. The final scene of the film when Merrick commits an act of self-euthanasia by lying on his back to sleep, which he is aware will kill him. After examining a painting of a small girl lying flat, he imitates her in a final attempt to be normal, resulting in his implied death. He drifts off to sleep as the words of his deceased mother ring out in his head. Nothing will die.I have heard some critics say that after seeing the film they did not know what is said about the human condition. This angered me. The message was clear and simple, and that is No matter the condition of the soul, the is still human. This theme is wrapped up so efficiently in the film's most iconic line.

Clarence's enthusiasm isn't dampened much when he discovers Alabama is actually a prostitute who was paid by his boss to bump into him; she's only been in the business for a few days, and is more than eager to give up streetwalking to be with Clarence. However, Alabama is certain her pimp, Drexl ,will not be happy; he's an ill-mannered sort with mob connections and a fondness for violence.Chivalrous Clarence offers to break the news to Drexl and collect her belongings, but he doesn't tell her he also plans to kill Drexl while he's there; a melee breaks out that leaves Drexl and his henchmen dead. Clarence grabs a suitcase that he thinks contains Alabama's clothes, but he discovers it instead holds five million dollars' worth of cocaine.

An actor i don't normally rate that highly , yet in the scenes with Walken he is amazing. There are other good performance from Brad Pitt , Gary Oldman and what looks like a young Tony Soprano from James Gandolfini. Having given all this praise i still think True Romance is far from being perfect. Quentin Tarantino's script is not a polished as we see in later films such as Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction, yet it's undeniably Tarantino . Also i was a little disappointed with the final five minutes of the film especially after THAT monumental shoot up. It's all a bit too happy ever after for my liking.

It's extremely 'cool' to be anti-religion these days, so big-budget movies with a core religious theme tend to get unnecessarily slammed. I'm not religious myself, but I do often enjoy supernatural and religiously themed stories, due to the themes and issues they frequently explore. So its success all hinges on whether you can accept a plot guided by supernatural religious elements or not. If you can, and you enjoy action movies occasionally, you'll probably enjoy End of Days.Arnold plays a depressed ex-cop turned high-level body guard with a suitably tragic back-story. Some people will enjoy his performance, others won't. Again, it depends on how you come to this. If you are expecting a versatile actor who changes personality with every performance, then you won't enjoy it. If you like Arnold, because he is exactly what he is, Arnold, then you'll probably have a ball. After all, who ever hired Charlton Heston or Humphrey Bogart or Christopher Walken to play a part in any way other than the specific way they do? You don't hire such actors because of their chameleon-like acting abilities, you hire them because their sheer screen presence is such that they stand out from the crowd and you enjoy seeing THEM in the role. As such, you either relish those actors in their parts, or you you dismiss them as wooden or bland. It depends on the viewer.The director, Peter Hyams (2010, Outland, Timecop, The Relic), has a tendency to enjoy very dark cinematography, and in this case it suits things perfectly. There are lots of scenes lit primarily by flames or torchlight, that set the tone. Meanwhile, John Debney's (Cutthroat Island, Passion of the Christ) score is also one of his best, and probably one the most effective 'demonic' soundtracks since Goldsmith's Omen trilogy. I would be remiss not to mention the effects work as well. Having watched the DVD special features, I was extremely impressed with how much old-style artistry and craftsmanship went into many of the effects. There was a great deal of miniature work involved, which is too often sidelined for less effective CGI these days. End of Days used a careful blend, only really using CGI where necessary.End of Days is a great roller-coaster ride of a movie, entirely suited to the date it was made for, and has a surprising amount of depth. Under the action and excitement, it's really a story about the main character's redemption, finding himself again, and discovering a meaning to his life after all he thought he had lost. It's also a classic good versus evil tale. To top it all off, we get a surprisingly touching and moving finale, which perhaps left a lot of people on too much of a downer, yet I found it the perfect conclusion to the story.All in all, End of Days is either a love-it or hate-it movie. It's not perfect, but I thought it was an excellent film, and one of Arnold's most interesting characters. If you don't mind religious themes, enjoy larger-than-life characters and adrenaline pounding action, then chances are you'll probably have a fantastic ride.

","genre":"Action, Fantasy, Horror"},{"date":"4 June 2009","score":"10 out of 11 people found the following review useful","review":" End of Days gets a bad rap, but I think a great deal of this is due to its initial premise. It's extremely 'cool' to be anti-religion these days, so big-budget movies with a core religious theme tend to get unnecessarily slammed. I'm not religious myself, but I do often enjoy supernatural and religiously themed stories, due to the themes and issues they frequently explore. So its success all hinges on whether you can accept a plot guided by supernatural religious elements or not. If you can, and you enjoy action movies occasionally, you'll probably enjoy End of Days.Arnold plays a depressed ex-cop turned high-level body guard with a suitably tragic back-story. Some people will enjoy his performance, others won't. Again, it depends on how you come to this. If you are expecting a versatile actor who changes personality with every performance, then you won't enjoy it. If you like Arnold, because he is exactly what he is, Arnold, then you'll probably have a ball. After all, who ever hired Charlton Heston or Humphrey Bogart or Christopher Walken to play a part in any way other than the specific way they do? You don't hire such actors because of their chameleon-like acting abilities, you hire them because their sheer screen presence is such that they stand out from the crowd and you enjoy seeing THEM in the role. As such, you either relish those actors in their parts, or you you dismiss them as wooden or bland. It depends on the viewer.The director, Peter Hyams (2010, Outland, Timecop, The Relic), has a tendency to enjoy very dark cinematography, and in this case it suits things perfectly. There are lots of scenes lit primarily by flames or torchlight, that set the tone. Meanwhile, John Debney's (Cutthroat Island, Passion of the Christ) score is also one of his best, and probably one the most effective 'demonic' soundtracks since Goldsmith's Omen trilogy. I would be remiss not to mention the effects work as well. Having watched the DVD special features, I was extremely impressed with how much old-style artistry and craftsmanship went into many of the effects. There was a great deal of miniature work involved, which is too often sidelined for less effective CGI these days. End of Days used a careful blend, only really using CGI where necessary.End of Days is a great roller-coaster ride of a movie, entirely suited to the date it was made for, and has a surprising amount of depth. Under the action and excitement, it's really a story about the main character's redemption, finding himself again, and discovering a meaning to his life after all he thought he had lost. It's also a classic good versus evil tale. To top it all off, we get a surprisingly touching and moving finale, which perhaps left a lot of people on too much of a downer, yet I found it the perfect conclusion to the story.All in all, End of Days is either a love-it or hate-it movie.

Directed by one of the greatest of all directors, Alfred Hitchcock, and starring two very able actors in Tippi Hedren and Sean Connery, yet has a bizarre feel to it that polarized me and essentially turned me off from caring about any of these people. I was surprised at how cold and distant it felt; even more so than that just from the tone of the story. As the story goes, a very complex and troubled woman named Marnie (Hedren) gets involved with her boss Mark Rutland (Connery) after he discovers her trying to steal from him. He is fascinated by what causes her to do such things and marries her in an attempt to find out the answer.Unfortunately for us, the answer is not as clear as it should be. Scene after scene depicts these two being cruel to each other, Marnie because she hates men and Mark because he wants her but she won't let him. To me, the movie runs for far too long and it gets quite out of hand right at the end when we see Marnie and her mother (Louise Latham) recalling a horrific memory. It comes off as simply forgettable; not even close the sheer perfection Hitchcock found in Vertigo, Psycho or Strangers on a Train. I have no problem with the psychological aspects of the characters, but they were not handled well and only caused further chaos to an already chaotic plot.

He starts having visions of a creepy guy in a dark rabbit suit called Frank, who tells him to do things and warns that something significant is going to happen soon. Is Donnie finally losing his marbles ?This movie achieves the near impossible - it's an original modern-day teenage angst film. In a genre that's been done a million ways twice, it skilfully blends together elements of youth rebellion, small town exposé and temporal paradox sci-fi stories into a unique and compelling drama. Better than that, it expertly forces us to identify with Donnie and see the fractured world through his perceptive eyes, and it has a terrific payoff that makes you want to watch the film over in order to understand it better. It's pretty weird in the absorbing way that David Lynch's films are, but unlike those it never feels surreal or arty. Kelly has a great bag of tricks full of clever surprises, but doesn't compromise on the drama of Donnie's situation and his movie is rich, funny, sad, thoughtful and intriguing. Gyllenhaal is terrific in the lead, never overacting but making us feel Donnie's confusion and insecurities so we can't help but empathise. The support cast is good, particularly McDonnell as the mom, and Barrymore, whose Flower Films company helped to finance the picture. It also has a commendable eighties drum machine song score, notably the Joy Division classic Love Will Tear Us Apart (very apt to the storyline) and a wonderfully fragile version of Tears For Fears' Mad World, performed by Gary Jules and composer Michael Andrews. The photography by Steven Poster is quite beautiful, as he uses subtly altered speeds through the frame (a much copied technique since) to echo Donnie's out of kilter abstract view of his small town world. A word about why I hate establishment film critics; this is a very interesting and laudable movie, but because it doesn't fit easily into a niche it was treated very badly by both the movie distribution business and the media, with the result that the extremely talented Kelly has struggled to find any funding for future films. Speak to any real people who've seen it though, and they're entranced. This was perhaps the most imaginative film of 2001, and yet critics would have you believe it was Gosford Park or A Beautiful Mind - spare me. So listen up kids; ignore those backhander-grabbing senile scribblers, and check out this puzzling, rewarding, deftly constructed little teenage-boy-goes-nutso drama instead.

The movie stars pop singer Mandy Moore, who plays Jamie Sullivan- the only daughter of the minister, and Shane West - one of the popular guys in the school (Landon Carter) . The movie was directed by Adam Shankman and has many nominations and wins.The story begins when Landon nearly kills a fellow student when he and his friends play a prank on him. As punishment, Landon has to participate in after-school community service activities - help the staff in school, tutor kids and take part in the school's yearly play. This faces him with Jamie - a girl who he has known all his life but ignored. He gets to know her better as she helps him with the school play. Unexpectedly, Landon finds himself falling in love and this new friendship brings him many problems with his old friends, while Jamie is forced to deal with her strict father and a secret that she's keeping from her schoolmates.The script is very exciting and the movie ends very dramatically.

He produced this film, based on a semi-popular DC comic book character, on a low budget that barely had enough for some action sequences and costumes for the monsters (or, as the trailer pointed out, Monsters AND Midgets), and he got what he paid for. It's a B movie, and fairly proud of its not-high aims as such.Rule 2) Likewise, do not rent or buy Swamp Thing immediately after reading Alan Moore's classic run. Moore's writing for Swamp Thing, which actually took place after this film was released, is an example of the highest standard of writing and drawing of horror comics, so much so that it would give Poe and Lovecraft their share of the willies. It's so good that it ranks almost on par with his comics Watchmen and V for Vendetta... and perhaps he took this movie as an example of certain things to try and correct, a criticism of the comic series up to that point on top of a cash-in flick. So, do be warned, if you're thinking that this will be intelligent horror, then you'll be proved wrong. It's sometimes quite dumb, in fact, and aimed at a level somewhere between impressionable youth and bored teenager.Rule 3) Watch Swamp Thing with a few buddies who can dig seeing Ray Wise in just about anything (I mean, come on, even if it's just for a few scenes it's Laura Palmer's Dad and the Devil on Reaper, what's not to like there?) and Adrienne Barbeau in her hottest glory years (there's even a scene of nudity, however brief, that is quite amazing considering the PG rating, but then again it was 1982), and viewing costumes where if you look close enough you can actually see the zipper on the back. Swamp Thing may or may not ask you, beg you, to imbibe some alcohol for the fun times, which may or mat not also make the movie lessor because of it. It's acting is sometimes just weird (that little black kid with the nerdy glasses, an oddball but effective choice), banal one-note caricatures (the soldiers) or just a dastardly attempt to circumvent campy over-the-top time with Jordan playing Arcane (but when he turns into his own personal monster, watch out!)Rule 4) Just remember while watching it, there's worse, MUCH worse, out there in the genre of the comic-book movie and the B horror movie. Craven himself has done worse when he's tried to aim higher (or arguably lower) with the disgusting Last House on the Left or when he was really slumming it in the lessor parts of the Scream series. He takes on this for-hire job like a pro, and while Swamp Thing doesn't call up his highest marks as a talent he does get through it with some invention, truly campy one-liners (Does it hurt? Only when I laugh) and even a few moments of effective atmosphere with the swamp scenery. Bottom line, don't expect the world of Swamp Thing, just enough to get by an hour and a half with a regenerative\/regenerating swamp doctor, and you'll do OK.

Forester from his own work, Captain Horatio Hornblower will disappoint most who are familiar with the BBC series that starred Ioan Gruffudd. Admittedly the television series had more time to develop character and situations, but, early on, Walsh's film drifts into non-essential scenes that detail an unconvincing romance and the ego-maniacal rants of a madman with whom Hornblower must cooperate. However, after a faltering start, the film focuses on life aboard ship and thrilling sea battles and becomes gripping fun.When the ship's supplies run low after a long voyage around the Horn, fresh ham arrives in the persona of Alex Mango, who appears in full Latino makeup as the egotistical El Supremo. Once Mango has fully chewed the sets and viewers have become accustomed to the bronze gel that turned pale English extras into sun tanned South Americans, Christopher Lee emerges as a Spanish captain to dispel whatever credibility has crept into the film. But the silliness quotient reaches its zenith when Virginia Mayo boards the HMS Lydia fresh from the fastidious attentions of her hairdresser, makeup artist, and costume designer. Reportedly arriving from a small sailboat, where she and her maid were the only women, Mayo glides immaculately along the deck to greet the captain and trade witty asides. Untouched by the sea or the tropical sun, she appears regularly on deck baring her milky white décolletage and displaying her jewelry and silk finery for Peck and the crew, who have been woman-less at sea for months. Forester may have felt uncomfortable writing about women and emotions, because the scenes between Peck and Mayo are the weakest. Physically, Gregory Peck makes a fine Hornblower, but, while his performance is acceptable, perhaps Gruffudd's work has made him the definitive Hornblower.Fortunately, once the ham and Mayo are off the screen, the film regains its footing. The battles are well executed, and, even if most are models, the tall masted warships on the high seas are thrilling sights. When Hornblower attacks a French fortress, the film soars, and any lingering thoughts of Mango and Mayo fade with the smoking cannon, the falling masts, and the flashing swords. Guy Green's color cinematography is excellent, and, when the wind fills the sails and the canvas billows, any quibbles fade. Captain Horatio Hornblower becomes rousing entertainment, especially for younger viewers and those who love films from a less cynical time when sailors were chaste and loyal, women were pale and pure, villains wore mustaches and spoke with accents, and heroes looked like Gregory Peck.

Jedediah (Jed) Clampett 7\/10 I of course liked Buddy Ebsen better, but Jim Varney does a good job of playing this billionaire hillbilly.Daisy (Granny) Moses 9\/10 Before I watched this movie, I thought to myself Nobody can replace Irene Ryan. I was right. Sort of. Cloris Leachman did a very, VERY good job. If not for Ryan before her, she would have been perfect. But, as perfect as she was, Irene Ryan was not just a perfect Granny, she WAS Granny Clampett.Jethro Bodine 3\/10 Max Baer Junior was better. Way better. The replacement was too corny, and stupid. (Baer was corny and stupid too, but in a funnier way. Not in this new...Jim Carrey way.)Elly May Clampett 12\/10 ;) Believe it or not, I actually liked the replacement better. Donna Douglas exaggerated the role a little too much for me. And the new Elly had a more rugged look to her. Whereas Douglas looked too much like a beauty pageant contestant, and not someone who had spent their life rassling with the critters.Pearl Bodine 8\/10 She was in it very little, but she did a good job. Again, it would have been a great job if not for the original.(names fail me. lol)Milburn Drysdale 6\/10 Not bad, but the replacement was a little old.Miss Jane Hatheway 2\/10 Yikes! I did not like her at ALL! She tried to hard to act like Nancy Kulp, refusing to recognize the fact that it is IMPOSSIBLE to act like Nancy Kulp! She exaggerated the role WAYYYY to much!

The only drawback is that the misadventures tend to be more on the PG side rather than the Family-Friendly TV series of the 60's\/70's.

Suddenly I need to wonder if the story is actually an old time morality tale, exploring old time values in a story of social disease and warfare linked to that. Hero and A_man consider their actions to be pure. There is a trail of mayhem that they unleash but that is such a good thing for them to do. It is an old fashioned morality tale? This is a modern theme that many stories explore. Of course, someone who is not a big baby might consider this to be cute rather than horror. Does this story reflect the modern world, if via a fairy story? My experiences of warfare on the IMDb pages says yes. My experience of other realities than IMDb pages says sometimes yes and sometimes no.

I rate this alongside such as Lindsay's Get A Clue, which I also find to be occasionally scary. In comparison, Hairspray is so nice. Further than that, I find a comment to be difficult to write for this. Post one draft, it feels lacking in some ways and it is not long before a revised draft is needed if the comment is not to seem to be too misleading. Fast Food Nation has the same problem, for me. * An actor stuck with the name A_man_da Bynes should be expected to get opportunities to act in stories that will occasionally frighten the dispossessed or make us want to vomit. The Amanda Show included some mild comments that include different facets. This takes that further. The bad guy is so much an evil version of people tied up to have not much freedom of action. And the tied up do get a lot of up-side-down corrections that tend to corrupt us more and more.

I thought this film is outstanding. True, it is very long, but the Holocaust was a very long and epic event, and the movie needed a long length to convey the harsh realities of the Nazi's treatment of the Jews. The cinematography was truly excellent, and some of the close ups of people being tortured or dying was enough to make you look away. The direction was taut and focused, most Spielburg's movies are good, but don't quite always have an impact on the whole audience. Schindler's List is visually disturbing and incredibly moving, and because of this, this is definitely Spielburg's best. The acting was phenomenal. Both Liam Neeson and Ben Kingsley give superb performances, and Ralph Fiennes is also very chilling in his role. The music by John Williams is not only haunting, but also unbearably sad, believe me I was in tears for a lot of this movie. All in all, a truly moving film, that deserves a 10\/10. Bethany Cox.

However there's none better than George Stevens' great Fifties classic Shane. It's a brilliantly told story that allies Alan Ladd's character with a rugged frontier family facing the hostility of cattlemen bent on preserving their way of life against the values of homesteading pioneers. Beautifully filmed, the picture ranks right up there with the best of the genre, including it's contemporary High Noon, and more recent efforts like Eastwood's Unforgiven. It's been a personal favorite ever since my first viewing, and will remain so until I stop watching movies altogether, and I just don't see that happening.The movie probably wouldn't have had the poignancy it enjoys had it not been for the central story of the Starrett's, and particularly Joe Starrett's (Van Heflin) unflinching commitment to stay on his own patch of ground. When Shane first arrives, his intentions aren't immediately known, and it comes as a surprise to the Starrett's that he's willing to stick around to help them against the Ryker bunch. In turn, Shane gains the trust of Starrett, his wife Marian (Jean Arthur), and young son Joey (Brandon De Wilde) who's admiration of the former gunman grows with each passing day.The story builds momentum slowly, almost annoyingly so when Shane at first avoids the taunts of henchman Chris Calloway (Ben Johnson) and seems to back down from a fight. It's with measured reflection that Shane casts his lot with the homesteaders, all the while understanding that this will probably be the last time he'll ever have to use the tools of his trade. Shane's climactic showdown with gun for hire Jack Wilson (Jack Palance) is the classic confrontation of good versus evil, and remains one of the best finales of the genre.Hey, remember that Happy Days episode when Fonzie paid tribute to his favorite movie of all time? The Fonz knew that Shane represented all that's good and right about our heroes. They stand up for the underdog and face down the bully, even if it means standing alone. Then, when the job's been accomplished, they move on, and little by little, the rest of the world moves slowly with them.
