This movie had a very small budget, unknown actors, no soundtrack, a first time director and a cinematographer fresh out of college. I believe that all of this helped make this movie great, give it that low-budget, realistic feel. I don't think it would have been as effective or scary if you took the same script and had a large budget. Anyway, last night it came on IFC and I decided to watch it and discovered that the movie had almost no sound but rather commentary from director Tobe Hooper, cinematographer Daniel Pearl and Gunnar Hansen who played Leatherface. It was very interesting and very informative. I'm not sure when they shot this but supposedly it was the first time the 3 of them had been together since they shot the movie in '73. SPOILER The best part was when they described the diner scene. The grandfather was actually a thin 18 year old kid who spent 10 hours in makeup and decided this was it, shoot it all now b\/c he wasn't doing this again. Thus, they shot for like 27 hours straight in this room which they said was in excess of 100 degrees. The whole movie was shot in extremely hot temperatures and Gunnar or Leatherface only had one shirt, so he basically had to wear the same shirt for 4 weeks, thus he really smelled. It was so hot during the diner scene that many of them were vomiting and they had to take numerous breaks to get fresh air. Gunnar said that he and the rest of the cast basically got so hot and tired that they went a little crazy and he actually believed he was Leatherface. There is a scene where he cuts Sally's finger and puts it in the old man's mouth. They did this shot over and over b\/c the pump attached to the knife kept getting stuck and wouldn't squirt any blood so Gunnar said he finally just took the tape off the knife and actually cut her finger b\/c he was basically nuts by this point and wanted the scene to end. Tobe said Sally was excellent and really took a lot of abuse physically but was really committed to the part. So if you go back and watch this movie check out this particular scene b\/c they said there wasn't a whole lot of acting go on in there, these actors were literally going insane and it really makes for a strong, disturbing, climatic performance.They also went into detail about a lot of the shots Daniel and Tobe experimented with such as the shot of the character Pam who is in the swing outside the brother's house and as she gets up to go into the house the camera comes up behind her from under the swing. This particular shot was not in the original script so Daniel and Tobe really had to put their feet down and threaten to walk out if it wasn't included. They really did an excellent job, I mean both of these guys were young and had never done anything like this before and their experimentation really payed off.If you really like this movie, I highly recommend checking this out although I'm not real sure where you could find it, maybe contact IFC - Independent Film Channel. If you don't think much of this movie, then you might also like this b\/c it really gives you feel for the whole movie making process and what these people had to go through to get what you finally see on the big screen. I rank this movie up there with the Exorcist, The Shining, Halloween, Psycho, Scream and The Event Horizon as my favorite scary movies.

This movie is horribly bad as a stand alone movie. This movie is horribly bad even compared to other bad horror movie sequels.The film tries to keep some of the same elements from the first Blair Witch, which was noble enough of them, but they almost entirely rely on these elements which simply do not work in a narrative format. Hell, in the first one what happened to that tree bridge didn't even work, but it comes back in this film both as a tree and as a bridge two seperate times.The only thing that this film has that was the least bit original or interesting was its postmodern twist. It was a cool idea to use the sequel to sort of critique the buzz around the first film, but clearly it is relying on that same buzz to try to get this film in an pleasing place in the minds of the viewers.The shameful thing of the film is that while obviously they were aware that not showing any graphic scenes wouldn't work in this one's narrative format as it did in the first one, the scenes of gore and violence and such that they included were not horrifying, or disturbing or creepy. They were just outright silly. A horribly fake animatronic owl staring at our characters. A knife puncturing what is obviously not a person and fake watery blood flowing out that would have been more at home in a Troma film. Children wearing bad makeup and walking backwards. I've seen creepier on the X-Files. Hell, I've probably seen creepier on the Simpsons (Homega Man, anyone?). Plus on top of that, most of the scenes of graphic imagery are not motivated by any characters background or psyche even though, they want us to believe that the Witch is messing with their minds. A stupid looking electric chair victim, a sex scene with clawing that goes to deep, these images do not in anyway connect back to the characters, they are just randomly thrown in, and if you are going to throw random stuff, at least make it good eye candy (seeThe Cell).On top of THAT, there are things in the movie that either don't make sense in the film's world or don't pay off inside the world of the film. The two things that don't pay off the most are the Wiccan (a horrible stereotype even though she says she hates stereotypes) lying about her past, and the file folders that the Goth girl finds. Each of these plot points never pay off and never lend themselves to the story or characters in any way.On top of THAT, the film claims that it is a recreation of events that happened after the first film came out. Why then do all of the characters have the same names as the actors that played them in BW2? Oh, they said the names had been changed, but why would they be changed to be the actors names when the real life people would have been all over the news as seen at the end of the film? In fact why say that it was real at all when in the press kits and interviews they don't even pretend for a moment?I also loved that because of the fact that they couldn't actually shoot in Burkittsville and they had to film elsewhere, the director Joe Berlinger thought that they had to plaster everything with the town's name. Hell, most of the first film was not in the town, they didn't feel that need. But in this film there is the Burkittsville blah blah church, the Burkittsville Cemetary, Burkittsville Police, Black Hills Gas, all obviously fake signs as bad as the box of generic fried chicken in the fridge (I thought they didnt label things just FRIED CHICKEN anymore outside of TV movies - here's a thought why not Burkittsville's Best Fried Chicken? or Black Hills Chicken Hut, or the best BW3's?)I respected Joe Berlinger's work before and he said in Entertainment Weekly that he took this job because he was banging his head on the Hollywood wall and this was his chance in. Sometimes what you choose not to do is important as what you do. And does anybody else think that maybe Artisan approached Joe Berlinger because they though he might be able to make a good faux documentary? Anyways, now I think Paradise Lost and Brother's Keeper were cool because of Bruce Sinofsky and Joe Berlinger should have waited for something else to try to cut his teeth on.In short the Blair Witch 2 doesnt function well as either a sequel, stand alone, or horror film in general and just plain isnt scary. Those positive comments on this page have got to be studio moles as every single person in the preview screening I was at was doing nothing but snorting and snickering from the very beginning. But the movie will probably make money cause people will probably just go see it because its the sequel or its Halloween. They should save their money and go see the rerelease of The Exorcist instead.

But in this film there is the Burkittsville blah blah church, the Burkittsville Cemetary, Burkittsville Police, Black Hills Gas, all obviously fake signs as bad as the box of generic fried chicken in the fridge (I thought they didnt label things just FRIED CHICKEN anymore outside of TV movies - here's a thought why not Burkittsville's Best Fried Chicken? or Black Hills Chicken Hut, or the best BW3's?)I respected Joe Berlinger's work before and he said in Entertainment Weekly that he took this job because he was banging his head on the Hollywood wall and this was his chance in.

Anyways, now I think Paradise Lost and Brother's Keeper were cool because of Bruce Sinofsky and Joe Berlinger should have waited for something else to try to cut his teeth on.In short the Blair Witch 2 doesnt function well as either a sequel, stand alone, or horror film in general and just plain isnt scary. Those positive comments on this page have got to be studio moles as every single person in the preview screening I was at was doing nothing but snorting and snickering from the very beginning.

","genre":"Adventure, Fantasy, Horror"},{"date":"27 October 2000","score":"","review":"  Let me spare you from having to waste your money on an absolute bomb like the Blair Witch Two.This movie is horribly bad compared to the first movie. This movie is horribly bad as a stand alone movie. This movie is horribly bad even compared to other bad horror movie sequels.The film tries to keep some of the same elements from the first Blair Witch, which was noble enough of them, but they almost entirely rely on these elements which simply do not work in a narrative format. Hell, in the first one what happened to that tree bridge didn't even work, but it comes back in this film both as a tree and as a bridge two seperate times.The only thing that this film has that was the least bit original or interesting was its postmodern twist. It was a cool idea to use the sequel to sort of critique the buzz around the first film, but clearly it is relying on that same buzz to try to get this film in an pleasing place in the minds of the viewers.The shameful thing of the film is that while obviously they were aware that not showing any graphic scenes wouldn't work in this one's narrative format as it did in the first one, the scenes of gore and violence and such that they included were not horrifying, or disturbing or creepy. They were just outright silly. A horribly fake animatronic owl staring at our characters. A knife puncturing what is obviously not a person and fake watery blood flowing out that would have been more at home in a Troma film. Children wearing bad makeup and walking backwards. I've seen creepier on the X-Files. Hell, I've probably seen creepier on the Simpsons (Homega Man, anyone?). Plus on top of that, most of the scenes of graphic imagery are not motivated by any characters background or psyche even though, they want us to believe that the Witch is messing with their minds. A stupid looking electric chair victim, a sex scene with clawing that goes to deep, these images do not in anyway connect back to the characters, they are just randomly thrown in, and if you are going to throw random stuff, at least make it good eye candy (seeThe Cell).On top of THAT, there are things in the movie that either don't make sense in the film's world or don't pay off inside the world of the film. The two things that don't pay off the most are the Wiccan (a horrible stereotype even though she says she hates stereotypes) lying about her past, and the file folders that the Goth girl finds. Each of these plot points never pay off and never lend themselves to the story or characters in any way.On top of THAT, the film claims that it is a recreation of events that happened after the first film came out. Why then do all of the characters have the same names as the actors that played them in BW2? Oh, they said the names had been changed, but why would they be changed to be the actors names when the real life people would have been all over the news as seen at the end of the film? In fact why say that it was real at all when in the press kits and interviews they don't even pretend for a moment?I also loved that because of the fact that they couldn't actually shoot in Burkittsville and they had to film elsewhere, the director Joe Berlinger thought that they had to plaster everything with the town's name.

Like Eyes Wide Shut, it uses atmospheric skills to entrance you.  The difference being, the project could scare you with that edge.  But now, we have the inevitable sequel.And I must say with all sincerity that while I found this film to be a drop off of the original, compared to the c*** horror films\/sequels of late (Scream 3, Urban Legends 2, etc.) this one is quite adequate.  At the very least it will make you cringe, or maybe just feel paralized like the first did.  Unfortunately, I just cringed.  The plot involves that after the Blair Witch movie, 5 people go up into the black hills to camp out for a night. But chaos ensues when they can't remember a thing they did, saw or felt, and when they leave, there mind begins to play tricks on them (and when they find the evidence of what went on, you might just have to spew in your popcorn from the gruesome footage that makes the Manson's look like the Smurfs).Overall, the direction (picked by original creators Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez) by Joe Belinger was not needed.  Anyone could direct this film, but the actors pull through to make us feel as paranoid as they do. Not great, but still a ranking horror flick for this year.

Well, it's the day of the movie, and I'm reading reviews that absolutely tear this movie apart because of it's crappiness.  But hey, it's a sequel, how bad can it be?Well, overall, the movie was pretty suspenseful.  I enjoyed Dick Beebe's writing in House on Haunted Hill, which was a good horror film, as well, so that kind of raised the standards for me, here.  Also, the editing job on this movie is quite superior, in contrast to a review I read somewhere. The editing jumps back from before and after this whole incident occurs, and really keeps you wondering. I liked the storyline, as well. It kept you into the movie throughout it's whole run. But, as someone mentioned on these reviews, it definitely relies on shock value. BW2, for the general teen audience that will see this film, is a pretty twisted, graphic and disturbing film, which is probably what director Joe Berlinger's target was. It really doesn't bother me as much, because I think it made the movie better...to a certain point. The gore kind of got...well...boring for me after a while. The weak stomach may have trouble watching this movie, but folks like me may get tired of seeing it. But the good side of this movie that it had some suspense sprinkled throughout, especially when they start contemplating about the strange events they had during their stay in the woods and they are viewing their videotapes. Also, it does come to a pretty amazing climax.  Getting off the track a little, it does have an awesome soundtrack, too.All in all, the sequel holds true to the legend, but don't expect it to be much like the first movie, which truly scared the hell out of me because of it's play on the mind.

The plot had serious holes, the essay format was strained at times and the end was rushed and incomplete. By all means watch this movie and think about what it means, but remember that you are the same as Derek, that biased views can brainwash people and turn them into copies of the biased idea.

And why can't people just enjoy the darn flick?  People say the science is bad.  WRONG!  Gravity is what holds planets around a sun.  If the planets are dense enough or big enough and the suns are small or less dense, than they very well CAN rotate around planets! Nobody even mentions the glow-slugs later!  Of course it makes sense that on a planet like this evolution would create phosphorescence as a defense mechanism.  Lovely detail! And quit whining about contrived plots and ripoffs!  You CANNOT make a movie today without ripping something off! For everyone who called this movie a wannabe or compared it to Aliens or the Matrix, I hate to break it to you, but the critters from aliens were almost IDENTICAL to a critter in a novel called Voyage of the Space Beagle by AE van Vogt written at least 20 years before Alien came out.  Likewise, the Matrix was ripped off from an RPG called Shadowrun which was released in the mid 80's!  And yes, it seems a little hokey that they just happened to crash in the 22nd year when the darkness came, but you'll notice in Alien that out of the whole gigantic refinery ship, the creature just happened to hide in the little teeny-weeny lifeboat ship.  And the queen in Aliens just happened to hide in the one place where they couldn't get her without killing themselves  And finally as for those who say the characters are shallow. When was the last time you saw a character admit they did something stupid? (Fry crawling down the hole) or when survivors thanked the pilot for the extremely tough job she did of keeping some of them alive in the crash instead of oh, great babe! ya really screwed us over with that pro landing!  And Riddick was still a nasty guy at the end, he was just starting to change and soften a little.  Kurt Russell overcame 35+ years of ironclad conditioning and mind control in just a few weeks in Soldier!

In this films case, it should never have been made.  Why ?. Simple, first of all the entire premise of this film.  Arnie was sent back in the first film, he is a T-101, and no other T-101 looks like him. After all, imagine an infiltration unit, and they all look the same.  Skynet is not stupid, it would not produce such a machine and then make them all look the same, the first film shows that in the scene where a T-101 infiltrates the Resistance underground base, that T-101 is not Arnie, therefore, in order for Arnie to play the role of the T-101 in this film, it has to be the exact same Terminator sent back in the original film, which means that the T-101 Arnie in the future, before being sent back to 1984, has to be captured and re-programmed to be sent back in the second film BEFORE he is sent back in the first film, which in turn means he cant be sent back in the first film, Reece is not the father of John Conner, and Sarah Conners' life follows its original path, which means that the T-1000 is not sent back in time, which means that Arnie is not sent back in the second film either, leading to no films what so ever!!!.  Due to all this, Arnie should not have been in this film in the first place. This massive piece of overlooked common sense that Cameron, in his hasty effort at making the (then) most expensive film ever, leads to this film falling at the first step. Onto the film itself, i like the way Sarah Conners' charactor has developed, the torture of being stuck in a psycho hospital, knowing that in a few years the human race would be at the brink of extinction and her attempts to train her son et al.  Which leads me to Edward Furlong.  What can i say about John that hasnt already been said.  The most high pitched, whiney irritating little kid charactor in the same league as Macauly Culkin, or whatever his name is, of Home Alone fame.  Thankfully, he has redeemed himself with his excellent performance in American History X. Next up, the miracle that is Arnie in this film. A Terminator. Smiling. Now, i know this film is supposed to be far more human than the first film, but come on Cameron!, this is stupid ! ! !. A Terminator who takes centuries in making decisions.  For example, near the end, when the T-1000 has just been frozen, and begins to defrease, how long does Arnie take to start moving ? An age, thats how long. Ok, you can understand Johns reaction to this, but a T-101's? And then of course, theres the old sunglasses right at the beginning. The reason the T-101 in the first film puts on black sunglassess is because he has only one human seeming eye, but in this film, hes' just trying to look cool.  A machine (sentient though it is), making a fashion statement. Along to the T-1000.  Robert Patrick was probably the major redeeming factor, however implausible (if he can retain clothing after it being burnt of him, frozen and blasted to bits, et al, how come he cant come through time with clothes on ?), was excellent.  OK, no where near as good as Arnie, and special effects are no match for the sheer intimadation factor of Arnie in T1, but nonetheless, all things considered, he did a very good job, considering that he wasnt in the film for half its running time as the good guys galavanted around doing there thing. Which brings me to the absolutely ludicrous act of destroying cyberdyne.James, lets just go through this Cyberdyne creates Skynet, Skynet trashes humans, humans fight Skynet, Skynet loses, Skynet sends T-101 back in the first film, it fails, Skynet sends T-1000 back in T2, it fails.  Hold on a second, if Cyberdyne is destroyed in T2, then Skynet is not created, Skynet cannot trash humans cause it doesnt exist. Therefore, T-101 is not sent back, T-1000 is not sent back, Terminator does not happen, niether does T2. Now, some of you can say, i am looking way to deep into films, but i dont think so, its just common sence, without cyberdyne creating skynet, Judgement day does not occur ! ! !. What was the point in these films ? ! ! !. So, lets finish this, as an action film, 8-10, as a sequel, even c****er than MI2, 0-10.
