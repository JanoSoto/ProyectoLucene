[{"date":"16 May 2008","score":"","review":" Okay, I am REALLY NOT into animated kids movies. I was years ago, and this was my favorite movie ever way back in the day. I am embarrassed to admit that I actually watched this movie today, even though I haven't seen it in years. But it is definitely not as bad as those silly little cartoons.The voice acting is brilliant. Jennifer Aniston was amazing! And I usually hate her. Harry Connick Jr. is clever and sharp, as always. I don't know who did the voice of Hogarth but that is one amazing little kid. And Vin Diesel as the Iron Giant......oh yeah!!! The story is incredible. And so are the characters. That's why I watched this movie today. I don't like it as much now as I used to. But then, I was obsessed with it years ago. Aside from the animated kids feeling, the movie is brilliant. Just not for young adults, I guess.7\/10. I should rate it even higher but that would be too embarrassing.

So Having established in the first minute of screen time that Olivia de Havilland is perfectly able to walk, albeit slowly, with the aid of a walking stick and further established inside another minute - via an exchange of dialogue with her son, about to leave her alone in the house for several days - that she will be able to dispense with the walking stick in just a few weeks, why, we wonder, has she seen fit to install an elevator that would not be out of place in a four-star hotel, in a modest-sized house in which the only stairs on view are straight and number no more than twenty treads at the outside. Why not install a stairlift? Okay, let that one go for a moment; after eleven minutes screen time the power fails leaving her suspended some six or seven feet above the ground. Eventually she presses the alarm button which rings, not, as we might suppose, in the local police station\/doctor's surgery etc but in an alley at the side of the house which depends on 1) someone passing by at the exact time the alarm sounds and 2) no noise from traffic on the large highway that runs in front of the house. Okay, let THAT one go, too. When a passing wino (Jeff Corey) stumbles into the kitchen deHavilland, who can't see who it is, launches into what SHE thinks is logical exposition A few months ago she broke her hip and had the elevator installed until it mended. This is where it falls down. To design, build and install such an elevator would take about three times as long as it would for the hip to heal so immediately the whole premise is out the window. When you're thinking this whilst WATCHING the film you know they're in trouble. Having said that it's certainly watchable; deHavilland, clearly anxious to put Melanie Wilks behind her, reveals a backbone (if not a hipbone) and Corey and Ann Sothern turn in fine support. Worth a look.

Basically on his birthday, George Malley (John Travolta) sees a strange light come down from the sky, and hit him. No-one else saw it, and over the next few days George develops newfound intelligence and telekinesis (moving things with his mind), and he uses these abilities for the good of his community. Word gets around about, and he becomes known as a freak, and everyone wants to know what happened to the old car mechanic. Soon enough the government gets involved wanting to see and understand his abilities. The only people that don't want to do anything to him, and are still good friends are Lace Pennamin (Pyrates' Kyra Sedgwick), Nate Pope (Forest Whitaker) and Doc Brunder (Robert Duvall). Also starring David Gallagher as Al Pennamin, Ashley Buccille as Glory Pennamin, Tony Genaro as Tito, Sean O'Bryan as Banes and Independence Day's Brent Spiner as Dr. Bob Niedorf. Besides the one or two fun to watch tricks Travolta can do, this film is no much of a phenomenon, but it's okay. Worth watching!
