Since I was born in 1977, I'm what you might call a Star Wars baby. At least that is what my mother told me. Star Wars has been a part of my life for years.Times have changed, but I remember feeling like the characters in Star Wars were friends who I was on a journey with. Do you know the feeling? Like, if I'm watching Empire Strikes Back, or if I happen to stumble onto it on some random channel, I have to immediately watch Return of the Jedi.A few years ago, while at dinner with friends. A cinematographer asked me what my greatest movie experience was. Without a doubt, Return of the Jedi's opening scene, where Darth Vader walks down the plank... I remember the audience's ovation.The movies were fun then. When Return of the Jedi was released, I remember Vader's opening scene and the long lines. The lines for Jedi where ridiculous.Like many of you, I was expecting to feel the same magic, when the last three movies were released. It didn't happen. I could be wrong, but I think the most exciting thing to happen in the Star Wars universe, within the last 15 years, has to be the Phantom Menace TRAILER. I remember downloading this trailer from Kazaa and hearing the audience going crazy. For a split second, when I watched the trailer back in 99, it was 1983 all over again.As the years have passed, I've grown attached to films with similar themes. The hero, who takes off on a journey and has a similar quest to Luke. A few years ago, I sought out the writer of another favorite film, The Last Dragon.The writer, Louis Venosta revealed to me, that Joseph Campbell's book, A Hero With a Thousand Faces, was an intricate part of his writing. I had never heard of Campbell until this time. I would learn that Campbell was the author who influenced Lucas. In fact, Campbell has said that Lucas was his greatest student.After reading several of Campbell's books and meeting with Venosta, I thought about writing the sequel to the Last Dragon, but then realized that I needed to write my own story.As a native New Yorker, and someone who could have lost his life during 9\/11, I felt that a story needed to be made. A new myth. I finished writing my first book in 2008. Over the last few years, I couldn't figure out how to get the story out to the people who needed and wanted to read it.Like many of you, I hate all of the remakes. I was watching EMPIRE OF DREAMS, the documentary of the Star Wars films and I see a comparison between the time when Star Wars was made and the current state of affairs in the United States today. When I was selling my book on the streets of New York, a passerby told me that there weren't any new stories since the Matrix.The name of my book is MASTERNEVER AND THE FLOW OF DEATH. You can download the entire book by visiting www.masternever.com I've included an entire soundtrack that accompanies the book. I hope you will download and enjoy the book.I hope you don't mind me posting here. After writing a book and several screenplays, I want to connect with people who have similar interest. The rest of the Star Wars babies. Those waiting for a new myth.I'm also posting here, because IMDb played a vital role in starting this journey four years ago.

But now I could appreciate every other aspect of the film, and it's all superb! The script is brilliant, the film grabs you from the very first scene, it's very unusual and arresting, a helicopter chasing a dog through the tundra, right away you're hooked, and it doesn't let up all the way to a brave and uncompromising ending. There is no fat in the script, everything serves the stories. If you want to know who the characters are just observe how they behave in the situation, there's no need to take time off from the plot to listen to MacReady talk about his time in Vietnam, we can see what kind of man he is very easily. Kurt Russel's performance, and every line he speaks, informs us. He is a hero simply because he does what he has to do, he kills a man(probably as an example) and he doesn't apologise.

Yet, Jim Morrison was a little too close to the present in terms of events, his life as a part of and outside of The Doors, to be a myth. A legend, yes, depending on your point of view about rock icons. There are many books about Jim and The Doors none I have not read, and I should, since I like their CD's. And because I like the movie so much. Yet the last part of the statement I just made invites an incredible amount of criticism, so much that the beliefs of other Doors fans become practically catechisms. The church of The Doors that has stoned the director of the film so much is angry, or was at a time. Ray Manzarek is a very good example. I don't think I saw him on video in the 15th year reissue. I don't see Manzarek in any of the special features. Although I love the movie, so much that I've seen it 20 times or more, I have to have respect for a man that was the closest member to Jim Morrison. They all loved Morrison, everyone in the band I mean, even John Densmore. I believe the drummer served to balance out the emotions. After all, the group was not Jim Morrison and The Doors. So, the movie begins with The Lizard Kind in his later days, a little heavier, enjoying the alcohol possibly more than ever, and accompanied by the spirit of the Indian played by Red Floyd Crow Westerman. The native American plays a crucial part of the movie. The spirit is watching Morrison, looking after him it seems. But not able to do anything to help. The movie shows Jim Morrison in a downward spiral. Like I said, this is a stand-alone review of the movie. A lot of things did happen, yet a lot of events and feelings were not explained. This was really a major motion picture, with Hollywood cinema attire, and obviously there are people still alive(or were) connected with The Doors who were offended. There have been many famous people, whether they were actors, musicians, comedians, politicians, poets and writers who have been the subject of movies. But those people, like Jackson Pollock or Nixon or Andy Kaufman were all, to my knowledge, never in docudramas until after their death. This is the big difference between Morrison and those I just named. Apparently, the surviving members of The Doors with the exception of Manzarek were for the movie. Maybe they changed their minds later. The movie The Doors blew my mind, because it was a major motion picture. What is ironically humorous about that fact is that the movie was garnered and placed under Paramount and now belongs to Lionsgate. It was hugely successful...one never knows what movie entities have on their mind. Didn't fit into their library. The uniqueness of the L.A. band in movie terms is that, after seeing a film about The Doors, it's an act that no other band can really top. To see a movie about The Byrds or The Airplane or The Grateful Dead...that might never happen. The reason could be each did not have such a wild poet\/singer with so much going on in his life...or those other Cali bands may have just said no to the idea, for any number of reasons. I'm just not one who is angry about the Doors movie. It's too different, and did not make me feel like an idiot. There are so few major pictures about American rock bands.

It was hugely successful...one never knows what movie entities have on their mind. Didn't fit into their library. The uniqueness of the L.A. band in movie terms is that, after seeing a film about The Doors, it's an act that no other band can really top. To see a movie about The Byrds or The Airplane or The Grateful Dead...that might never happen. The reason could be each did not have such a wild poet\/singer with so much going on in his life...or those other Cali bands may have just said no to the idea, for any number of reasons. I'm just not one who is angry about the Doors movie. It's too different, and did not make me feel like an idiot. There are so few major pictures about American rock bands.

Blue Velvet does not do this. Instead, it makes us look at what we failed to see, or at what we saw a glimpse of and turned our backs against. It must be, in this case, a version of the real world. There are murderers, there are pain-aholics, there are those who pretend to do good while secretly smiling only to themselves. David Lynch knows that some of us prefer not to look at this side. It is easier to shut our eyes. With this film, Mr. Lynch makes us open our eyes (almost) as wide as they can go. It is a disturbing experience.When asked to give a rating, I gave this a four out of five. By Netflix standards, this means I really liked it. That is not true. I wanted to only give it three stars, but that would mean I liked it. That expression is too dull for my ears. I liked it. Just liked it, as if I could just shrug either way. No, I neither liked it nor really liked it nor did I hate it. It was a film that I may not ever see again, but I am glad that I have now seen.Why? Some films glorify violence. The creators show naked women and naked men to show how wrong something is, whether it be an action or a gesture or a slam towards a particular sex. This film really does just want to show something about the world, but it neither wants to claim it as being right or wrong. The phrase, It's a strange world is repeated multiple times throughout the film. This is what the director most likely wants us to think that we live in strange times filled with strange people doing strange thing. It is up to us to decide whether or not this fits with our moral code. Among this line are other redundant or seemingly off lines. The script is not the main attraction to the film. If one only read the script (which I did first before seeing the film), it would be easy, although untrue, to say that the film is horribly written. Somehow, though, with the exception of a few scenes (most notably the one where Jeffery tells Sandy what he saw when following a murderer and Sandy replies by giving him a vivid account of a dream she had in which robins flew around happily and represented beauty in the world), the script does work and make sense for the situations. It is fantastic directing from Mr. Lynch.Just like Mulholland Drive and Eraserhead, sound plays a large role and accounts for many of the creepy scenes. A fair amount of suspense is generated by playing sounds of strange noise in the background of select scenes. It sounds very mystical and somewhat dangerous, which does add tremendous amounts to the film.While I hate to say it, the style beats the substance here. It should not be the case, but it is. Some reviewers have said that they felt like the film constantly went from humor to darkness to humor again. I did not see any humor whatsoever (although I have only seen one viewing.) Instead, I felt like some of the images of the blue water and the blue sky and the sounds of a Donna show just added to the irony of the situation. After all, there is a murder\/crime trying to be solved, and yet people can still wake up to the cool, jazzy sounds of the Lumberton radio? And it is those small details that really summarize the film as a whole. There will always be those who whistle and those who kill, always those who do good and those who do bad. There is no resolution or explanation of why people do the things they do. Because this was the case for all of the characters, I did not feel cheated at the end. By not telling us, we are less able to judge (or are we more able?) and are more likely to think about it long after it is over.

If so, MISSION IMPOSSIBLE is best viewed not as the TV series revival but as a stand-alone movie, which it actually is pretty good.While MISSION IMPOSSIBLE is far from De Palma's best works, and it is pretty mainstream from the usually independent director, but it does boast some of his signature styles.

In the end, while it is a Hollywood product, it's still very much De Palma.Now, stepping away from my obvious affection for De Palma's style, MISSION IMPOSSIBLE is quite a good action movie, even an uncommonly intelligent one. In fact, most of the action occurs momentarily and doesn't consume the storyline as it is often in Hollywood action movies.

The musical score Lara's theme (Somewhere my love) is an excellent find to reinforce the false romanticism. Neither is Doctor Zhivago an outstanding portrayal of WWI. On this subject there are clearly better creations, for instance the German film Westfront 1918 (which reverses the love story of Doctor Zhivago a soldier is granted leave and finds his wife in bed with another man). Nevertheless, Doctor Zhivago deserves to remain a part of our film history (unfortunately I did not read the book; if I only had time...). For I do not know films that give a better account of the Russian October revolution, and the effects on the living conditions. The decay of society, the uncertainty and misery, the terror, the civil war. Zhivago belongs to the small upper middle class, that was emerging in the feudal Russia at the start of the twentieth century. The Tsar is still the absolute ruler, but his reign is festered with corruption and nepotism. His rule already obtained a staggering blow in 1905, during the turmoil after the lost war against Japan. In WWI the nearing defeat against Germany can only lead to his abdication. Zhivago is a promising poet, and happily married with his youth friend Tania. Lara is married to the revolutionary Pasha, but it is clear that she can never adapt to his lifestyle. Zhivago joins the army as a physician, and empathizes with the fate of the common soldiers. Here he again meets his acquaintance Lara, and a spark jumps over. Zhivago returns to Moscow, where the Bolshevists have seized power, They confiscate the apartments of Zhivago's family. In the mean time a civil war has erupted in Russia, between the Red Army and the White rebels (supported by the western powers, who have a strong disliking for a socialist experiment, I guess mainly because of the nationalizations). The Zhivago family decides to flee Moscow, and take a truly crowded train, which throws them into a primitive life. During a short stop, Zhivago takes a stroll and is seized by the Red Army of Trotski. They need him as a physician, and force him to participate in their battles. These are heart-rending scenes, since the Russian society is rapidly disintegrating, and the Bolshevist alternative is inadequate. Finally Zhivago can bear the brunt no more, and deserts. Fate reunites him with Lara. They flee to the summer residence of the Zhivagos, which in mid-winter looks like an fairy tale ice-palace. Amidst the collapse of society Zhivago and Lara possess the luxury to create their own dream. Here Zhivago reaches his greatest heights as a poet. And then, as a result of the revolutionary activities they are separated again. The harmonious life with his wife Tania has become impossible, and she flees the country. Zhivago remains back as a broken man. Somewhere else Lara bears his daughter, and it is suggested that Lara later becomes a victim of the indiscriminate Stalinist repression. A nice touch is, that the story is embedded into another short story, namely the life of his supposed daughter (many years later, during the Chrutshov era) as a fulfilled factory worker. So in conclusion, the revolutionary times are portrayed as the reign of brute violence, and I am pretty certain that this resembles the truth. It was a wretched experiment, and certainly not a time of hope. It was as unfortunate as Zhivago's affair. For me, this is the message of the film.

When fan outcry for a TREK movie reached a tipping point, Paramount execs dillydallied over whether to target the silver screen or the boob tube with a bastardized concept called STAR TREK PHASE II, a revolving door of writers and directors came and went, innumerable rewrites, pulling plugs, and TREK'S creator, Gene Roddenberry, whining about every aspect of the production from the crawlspace he was promoted to - until - 20th Century Fox released a tiny little thing called STAR WARS...Suddenly, in true, characteristically gutless, tunnel-visioned fashion, the heads at Paramount decide to greenlight a space adventure of their own - STAR TREK THE MOTION PICTURE.Eventually directed by Robert Wise, written by Alan Dean Foster, Harold Livingston and a host of poor, uncredited bastards who got the pointy end of Paramount's stick, STAR TREK THE MOTION PICTURE hits the 23rd century like a space version of THE WHO'S TOMMY - the sublime and ridiculous in an arranged marriage that serves cheap champagne at the reception with the best man getting drunk and falling into the cheese brioche.Excellent concept, terrible execution. STAR TREK THE MOTION PICTURE is a plodding masterpiece; brains but no balls; a whole lotta nothing, to say a small lotta something. Remember this was way back in the 23rd century, long before supporting cast were actually required to act, and just after they updated their onboard computers to 1984 standards.When three Klingon ships are destroyed by hokey special effects, by an entity traveling towards Earth to wreak more hokey special effects, Starfleet sends Admiral James Kirk (William Shatner) to stop it; in a reconditioned Enterprise, now captained by Decker (Stephen Collins, wearing his bestest teddy bear pajamas), whose Federation Starship crew is made up of a bunch of humans and one guy in the back wearing a funny mask.They pick up DeForest Kelley (Bones, as irascible as ever), Leonard Nimoy (Spock, dressed as Batman), James Doohan (ever-complaining Scotty) and the three Ringos - George Takei (Sulu, who can't act), Walter Koenig (Chekov, who can't act in English) and Nichelle Nichols (Uhura, who can't act but sports a decisively street Mod Squad 'do).Added to the crew purely for prurient masturbation fantasies is Persis Khambatta as Ilia, whom the producers tried to make a better actor by shaving her head and not allowing her to wear panties. They failed. Ilia enters the ship with the line, My Oath of Celibacy is on record. Huh? Where'd that come from? Well, it's a well-known fact the producers used Trekkie geeks as extras, so she was probably using that voodoo all day to ward off guys in homemade Starfleet uniforms who considered touching her as breaking their virginity.Rounding out the cast ineffectually is Gene Roddenberry's nepotistic wife, Majel Barrett, as Nurse Whatever, whose key scene involves spraying something on Chekov's injured arm, like she's acting as if she's spraying something on Chekov's injured arm. This is just after Chekov injures his arm by having it near some sparklers that suffice for malfunctioning electronics and crying Aagh! like some community theater actress.The Enterprise encounters a wormhole due to Kirk not reading the instructions - a wormhole that looks suspiciously like the delay effects in old Jimi Hendrix videos - and eventually run into the alien entity that destroyed the Klingon ships, called V'Ger, a magical artificial intelligence that adheres to no scientific or technological reality; you know, like all space films made in Hollywood.V'Ger takes over Ilia's mind and bequeaths her a miniskirt bathrobe so short we can see her v'ger. Then the Enterprise flies into quaint dye-in-water effects supposed to be the innards of V'Ger, and the crew stand around the bridge and look at the wavy colors changing on the monitor. For about three hours.There are two questions In the first hour, Where the hell is Spock?; in the second hour, What the hell is going on? Well, Spock eventually appears in his Batman outfit, making Kirk spurt in his pants, but the answer to the second question seems to be More Special Effects.The concept turns out to be excellent V'Ger is the Voyager space probe that Carl Sagan and NASA launched to the cosmos in the 1970s as a message of amity from Earth to the universe. After traveling to a distant civilization of robots, Voyager gained cognizance and was now returning to Earth seeking its creator.STAR TREK tries to flex its effects muscles - and strains them. Even with effects legends, John Dykstra and Douglas Trumbull, the technology just wasn't good enough back in '78; even with George Lucas's ILM on the job - but we can be pretty sure Lucas held his A-Team close to his chest, for his own little space dalliances.After feeling like a fifth wheel for the body of the movie - except when cultivating the emotionless Ilia - Decker sacrifices himself by stepping into Voyager and becoming a human-machine symbiote (or something that glows a lot) while everyone else runs and anti-climactically escapes.Thus the human adventure begins. Be still my v'ger.

Then the Enterprise flies into quaint dye-in-water effects supposed to be the innards of V'Ger, and the crew stand around the bridge and look at the wavy colors changing on the monitor. For about three hours.There are two questions In the first hour, Where the hell is Spock?; in the second hour, What the hell is going on? Well, Spock eventually appears in his Batman outfit, making Kirk spurt in his pants, but the answer to the second question seems to be More Special Effects.The concept turns out to be excellent V'Ger is the Voyager space probe that Carl Sagan and NASA launched to the cosmos in the 1970s as a message of amity from Earth to the universe. After traveling to a distant civilization of robots, Voyager gained cognizance and was now returning to Earth seeking its creator.STAR TREK tries to flex its effects muscles - and strains them. Even with effects legends, John Dykstra and Douglas Trumbull, the technology just wasn't good enough back in '78; even with George Lucas's ILM on the job - but we can be pretty sure Lucas held his A-Team close to his chest, for his own little space dalliances.After feeling like a fifth wheel for the body of the movie - except when cultivating the emotionless Ilia - Decker sacrifices himself by stepping into Voyager and becoming a human-machine symbiote (or something that glows a lot) while everyone else runs and anti-climactically escapes.Thus the human adventure begins. Be still my v'ger.

For good reason.It doesn't move. At all. In space no one can hear the grass grow.Witness the stagnant immobility as Captain Kirk and Scotty silently circumnavigate the Enterprise in a docking craft, in loving reunion, as a Captain visually undresses his ship after a long separation, and you will heartily, if not sleepily, agree.Which is ironic, considering the firestorm of indecisive action that birthed the movie Phoenix-like from its cheap, unsuccessful 1966 series that somehow spawned a cult in reruns. When fan outcry for a TREK movie reached a tipping point, Paramount execs dillydallied over whether to target the silver screen or the boob tube with a bastardized concept called STAR TREK PHASE II, a revolving door of writers and directors came and went, innumerable rewrites, pulling plugs, and TREK'S creator, Gene Roddenberry, whining about every aspect of the production from the crawlspace he was promoted to - until - 20th Century Fox released a tiny little thing called STAR WARS...Suddenly, in true, characteristically gutless, tunnel-visioned fashion, the heads at Paramount decide to greenlight a space adventure of their own - STAR TREK THE MOTION PICTURE.Eventually directed by Robert Wise, written by Alan Dean Foster, Harold Livingston and a host of poor, uncredited bastards who got the pointy end of Paramount's stick, STAR TREK THE MOTION PICTURE hits the 23rd century like a space version of THE WHO'S TOMMY - the sublime and ridiculous in an arranged marriage that serves cheap champagne at the reception with the best man getting drunk and falling into the cheese brioche.Excellent concept, terrible execution. STAR TREK THE MOTION PICTURE is a plodding masterpiece; brains but no balls; a whole lotta nothing, to say a small lotta something. Remember this was way back in the 23rd century, long before supporting cast were actually required to act, and just after they updated their onboard computers to 1984 standards.When three Klingon ships are destroyed by hokey special effects, by an entity traveling towards Earth to wreak more hokey special effects, Starfleet sends Admiral James Kirk (William Shatner) to stop it; in a reconditioned Enterprise, now captained by Decker (Stephen Collins, wearing his bestest teddy bear pajamas), whose Federation Starship crew is made up of a bunch of humans and one guy in the back wearing a funny mask.They pick up DeForest Kelley (Bones, as irascible as ever), Leonard Nimoy (Spock, dressed as Batman), James Doohan (ever-complaining Scotty) and the three Ringos - George Takei (Sulu, who can't act), Walter Koenig (Chekov, who can't act in English) and Nichelle Nichols (Uhura, who can't act but sports a decisively street Mod Squad 'do).Added to the crew purely for prurient masturbation fantasies is Persis Khambatta as Ilia, whom the producers tried to make a better actor by shaving her head and not allowing her to wear panties. They failed. Ilia enters the ship with the line, My Oath of Celibacy is on record. Huh? Where'd that come from?

Basically an American US TV station is planning a live Christmas Eve production of the Charles Dickens classic A Christmas Carol, but the guy making it all happen, programming executive Francis 'Frank' Xavier Cross (Bill Murray) is a cold-hearted, selfish and mean bigot. Having spent years being the way he is, and being Christmas Eve, he is visited by the spirit of his dead boss, Lew Hayward (John Forsythe) and told that he could be like him if he doesn't change. Just like the Dickens tale he also says Frank will be visited by three other ghosts to try and mend his ways and appreciate the Christmas spirit, and he ignores it at first thinking he was dozing. While walking around the television studio however, Frank is first visited by the cab driver Ghost of Christmas Past (David Johansen), who shows him his childhood and growing up, including falling in love Claire Phillips (Starman's Karen Allen), and ultimately becoming mean. Next is the life-size pixie Ghost of Christmas Present (Carol Kane) who shows Frank all the people who know him and he finds out what they really think of him behind his back. Finally the seven-foot-tall ghoul, The Ghost of Christmas Future shows Frank what will happen in the time to come if he doesn't make a difference to his life. Of course Frank returns to the TV studio with a change of heart, even interrupting the live broadcast to increase salaries and wish the viewers a Merry Christmas, and he shares a kiss with Claire. Also starring Police Academy 2 Their First Assignment's Bobcat Goldthwait as Eliot Loudermilk, Robert Mitchum as Preston Rhinelander, John Glover as Brice Cummings, Alfre Woodard as Grace Cooley, Brian Doyle-Murray as Earl Cross, Throw Momma from the Train's Anne Ramsey as Woman in Shelter, The Love Bug's Buddy Hackett, Beetle Juice's Robert Goulet and Lee Majors. Murray for the first half of the film is the kind of modern Scrooge you would expect with his sarcastic comments and humorous grouchy demeanour, but the rest of the film does indeed go into sentimental mush and get less funny, overall, I don't necessarily agree with the critics' three stars out of five, but not a terrible seasonal comedy. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Makeup. Okay!
