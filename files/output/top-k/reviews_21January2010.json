[{"date":"21 January 2010","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" City Lights came out 3 years after the talkies took over -- which Chaplin didn't like, he much preferred silent films and his style of physical, visual comedy (and no wonder, he was a genius at it). CL takes a few shots at the talkies, as in speeches by politicians in which -- instead of spoken words, the sounds that match their speaking are much like kazoos imitating speech intonations, inflections. CL was snubbed by the Oscars committee possibly for this attitude but, since then, CL is widely considered to be one of the greatest movies of all time. It's on Ebert's Great Films list; it's #70 on IMDb's list of all time 250 greatest movies; AFI (American Film Institute) ranks it #1 among romantic comedies.CL gives us the essential, iconic Little Tramp and a large heaping of Chaplin's gifts for physical comedy -- scenes of him impaling his pants on a statue's sword, as a street sweeper trying to avoid picking up after a group of horses only to run into an elephant, his boxing scene, getting in and out of cars, dance parties, etc.It also gives us the poignancy that Chaplin's Little Tramp specialized in, probably more than any other movie he made. The LT is attracted to a blind flower girl (roughly 20? 23? years old) and, after determining that she's blind, resolves to help her. She thinks he's wealthy and the LT doesn't correct this misbelief.The LT also runs into an alcoholic, suicidal millionaire and prevents him from committing suicide several times. Whenever he's drunk, this A$M calls the LT his best friend but, whenever he's sober, he has no memory of their relationship and orders him away from him.So there are two central characters in the movie -- each blind in their own ways to the LT -- the girl recognizes his true compassion but not his lack of wealth or low status. The A$M recognizes the LT's value and compassion only when he's drunk, never when sober. A couple young newspaper boys never recognize his value and try to torment him whenever they see him.The LT sees a newspaper article about a surgeon in Europe who's able to restore sight to those with the blind girl's condition. The LT, after many failed attempts, is finally able to get and give her the money to have the operation that restores her sight.The final scene in the movie -- in which she, with her vision restored doesn't recognize the LT by sight but does so by feeling his hand -- has often been described as one of the most moving in all film history.BTW, Chaplin also composed all the music for the film including the song, Who will buy my pretty violets?, the theme played when the blind flower girl was on screen. Chaplin couldn't read or write music but he was an accomplished amateur pianist and violinist. He employed a musician to listen to his playing and transcribe it into musical notation.

","genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance"},{"date":"21 January 2010","score":"7 out of 15 people found the following review useful","review":" A young American novelist, Holly Martins (Joseph Cotton), arrives in Vienna looking for his friend Harry Lime (Orson Welles). Once in the city, however, he learns that Harry Lime has passed away. Shocked, Holly Martins starts asking questions, a lot of them. He is told a number of different stories that eventually lead him to believe that Harry Lime was killed.Determined to find out who is responsible for Harry Lime's murder, the American embarks on a treacherous journey amidst the unfriendly streets of Vienna. Soon, he is entangled in a web of deceit and dangerous machinations. Along the way, the American also encounters the beautiful Anna Schmidt (Alida Valli), a Czech national with forged Austrian papers, who agrees to help him.Written by the legendary Graham Greene, Carol Reed's The Third Man is a terrific hybrid of a film where noir, neo-realism and Hollywood bravado are mixed to perfection. Set in post-war Vienna, the film is very much a dark caricature of sorts where the finesse, elegance and tradition of Old Europe are seen through the eyes of a naive but ambitious American looking for his missing friend.Contrary to what many critics have claimed, the actual story is rather complicated. A giant mystery surrounding Oscar Welles' character, Harry Lime, is slowly peeled off, piece by piece. As a result, The Third Man quickly evolves into a guessing game where every little detail is worth analyzing. As expected for a noir-film, there is also a dangerous femme fatale who becomes a prominent player as soon as the main protagonist reaches Austrian soil.In addition to strong dark overtones, The Third Man also boasts a great deal of nihilism. Betrayal and impossible love for example are depicted by Carol Reed with a sense of realism that feels uncannily contemporary. Not surprisingly, The Third Man works incredibly well not only as a non-stop adventure film, but also as a realistic depiction of a world struggling to recuperate after an enormous tragedy.Furthermore, even though The Third Man is a British film, its view on Old Europe is distinctively American. The clash of cultural ideologies, as witnessed through the interactions between Alida Valli and Joseph Cotton, is particularly impressive. There are entire scenes where Carol Reed focuses on the American whose alarming naivety produces some of the most hilarious yet, disturbing sequences that compliment the mystery.Finally, Anton Karas' soundtrack is beautiful. The mellow sounds produced by his zitner grant The Third Man with an entirely new flavor, one that blends with the dark vistas from Vienna's sewers exceptionally well. Not surprisingly, the atmosphere The Third Man sustains is often cited as its greatest strength.
