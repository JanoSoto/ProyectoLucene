Its budget would appear to be pretty low despite the pyrotechnics and veneer of effects; watch those scenes with the aliens, as weirdly cute and obviously fake as they are, for proof of that. And other actors around him, including Lindsay Crouse as the main character's wife and their son Andrew (Joel Carson), don't impress much except in their rigid one-dimensional parts, she as the shrill wife, he the precocious\/scared kid.So it falls on Walken to steal the show, and really, how could he not with this? Another actor might play Whitley Streiber- named after the author and supposedly based on the author's actual experiences with aliens- with a straight face, maybe like Richard Drefuss in Close Encounters of the Third Kind, a down-to-earth father and husband who is good to his kid (more or less) and loves his wife and has wisecracks and an original sensibility as a novelist to spare. But Walken, when he walks in (see what I did there), does his own thing with his unique, sometimes awkward and hilarious vocal inflections, and a way of looking at things that can be over the top as dead-pan, if that makes sense.Actually, to give a better example of what Walken can do here better than anyone, watch the scenes where he reacts first to the blazing lights of the alien ships (a kind of detached amusement, some interest when his son screams, and even a smirk of hah, you don't amuse, me to the aliens when they arrive). Then, when he's on the ship, oh boy this is when we get to the bizarre stuff, as Walken talks to the camera (I am me, I am here, we are all together like in I Am the Walrus or something), or sits back reading a magazine, or has an ambiguous response to the aliens advances with shaking hands. Probing him, of course, turns out to be another matter, albeit we see this all when Whitley is under hypnosis.So a lot of this, plus some random scenes where we see Whitley's writing process writing under different characters and voices on a monitor, or those hypnosis scenes (or a classic scene where he sees everyone on a bus as a giant bug - Walken in the midst of sci-fi comedy Kafka), makes for some classic Christopher Walken bits. Hell, the guy even dances from time to time! This and a few creative touches as director from Philippe Mora help make this a kind of guilty pleasure. I can't recommend it the same way I could Close Encounters, since that one genuinely inspires and awes and gives great performances and music. This one has Eric Clapton on an off-day, low-rent alien fx and lighting cues, and it just kind of... ends really, on a note that should have been a few minutes before. But if you love Walken being Walken, and want some cheesy alien-abduction sci-fi, you can surely look here for the goods - certainly it's a big step up from a more recent self-serious true story alien movie, The Fourth Kind.

One of the reasons why this captivated me was because the title, a simple plan, had a sense of sarcasm stuck to it. It should have read not a simple plan. Only a genius like Sam Raimi can do something like that to make you love the movie before you have seen it. He has created blockbusters like The Spider-man Trilogy, The Evil Dead Trilogy, Darkman, and Drag Me To Hell, and I have to say that A Simple Plan tops that list in an instance. I had high hopes for this film but not too high and I was surprised to see this movie wrap around me like a warm, bloody blanket. Sam has done a great job and why isn't this on the IMDb top 250 list! It should be on there!!! The cast is perfectly chosen because it contains actors who have a lot of talent to give to this film and who also are quite famous so you can say, Hey, I know that guy...and that guy too. Matter of fact, I know them all!. The depiction of innocent Hank to not so Innocent Hank is portrayed with great execution by Bill Paxton. He plays his role smartly, seriously, and enthusiastically, couldn't say that in the movie though. Jacob is Hank's older brother and his life isn't as great as his brothers. I guess, you could call him a loser! And do you know who plays him? Yep, you're right, Billy Bob Thornton is the appropriate choice for the portrayal of Jacob. This role should have helped him for Bad Santa. Life is the same, personality ain't. Bridget Fonda plays, at first, a charming pregnant lady who is the wife of Hank. Things are going well, until the money rolls in and from then on she becomes a great tactician on how to hide the money and keep it safe. She is deceiving and her intentions become clearer on how to use the money at the end. In my opinion, I consider her act the finest and tastiest. There have been a lot of questions on which one is better The novel or The film. I haven't read the novel, nor plan to, but whatever anything originates from is not as good as the original. That is my saying. The motion picture will sound lame to you at first but, hey, looks can be deceiving. To me it seemed like an drama that moves slowly and boringly but , in fact, this picture is quite the opposite. The first few minutes are slow but from then on a trail of murder, deception, and cover ups lie in the way for Hank and his brother. The first murder scene was unexpected and it shocked me but then when the second murder scene came on, I knew from then on that this was the beginning of a long and murderous task.(minor spoilers)It all starts when Hank, his brother Jacob, and Jacob's friend, Lou, are driving when a fox run in front of their car and later, their dog follow the fox. The trio discover an abandoned, crashed plane, that, mysteriously, has four million dollars in cash in it.

North by Northwest would most certainly belong in his mainstream films category and would most certainly be his best easily within that respective category and possibly his best film period. NXNW finds Hitchcock at the top of his form. No doubt he showed early technically impressive signs, most especially with the film Rope, which was made up entirely of two takes. Here though Hitchcock is at this most confident, his most steady. It's had to imagine the story came from the idea to use a bunch of different set pieces because the story is one of the best parts of the movie. Again he uses his staple of mistaken identity, but Cary Grant goes above and beyond the call of duty being particular awesome as Roger O. Thornhill a New York Mad Man. A run though of the plot would be a little dumb at this point, but just know that Grant gets framed as a murderer and has to track down the killers and clear his name. Along the way we runs into Eva Marie Saint, who may or may not be someone to trust. The two share some real chemistry, which sort of grounds a film that is a bit ridiculous (in a good way). Some may say that it is a little long, but the pacing is perfect, there is never really a dull moment, plus wasn't that abomination Transformers 2 longer, and everyone seen that.The film is full of iconic scenes, the crop duster scene, Mount Rushmore, etc. What is most interesting is that I've heard of comparisons of this to James Bond, but the first Bond film didn't come out till the following year.

Because of this hopes for Star Wars Episode II Attack of the Clones were low. Luckily Attack of the Clones was a big improvement, but still does not match the heights of the original trilogy.10 years after the events of The Phantom Menace many star systems are attempting to break away from the Republic, led by a former Jedi Knight Count Dooku (Christopher Lee). Because of these events the Senate debate on whether to create a new army. One of the key players is Senator Padme Amidala (Natalie Portman), who becomes the target of an assassination. The Jedi Knights are called into action. Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) is assigned the mission to investigate the assassination attempt, whilst his young apprentice Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) is asked to act as Padme's bodyguard. Obi-Wan Kenobi quickly discovers a wider conspiracy involving a clone army already been made for the Republic and the hunt for a bounty hunter, Jango Fett (Temuera Morrison). On Naboo Anakin and Padme start to fall in love with each other, despite it is forbidden by the Jedi code. Anakin also suffers from dreams about his mother and on the planet Tatooine explores his dark side. With war edging closer all the Jedi Knights are called into action.There are a number of reasons why Attack of the Clones is better then The Phantom Menace. There is a better plot and much more of a drive in this film, the lead up to a war. There is a hell of a lot of action in the film which will entertain most people with good moments throughout.

Today there is no question. Some would argue that there is also no question that it is the best movie ever, I don't fully agree.

The film moves at a leisurely pace, never to slow or too quick and while it is not the most cathartic of movies Citizen Kane has much to say. To me, the film is driven primarily by Welles' performance. If you want something done well, you gotta do it yourself, and Welles knew that. The reason for the studio's dislike of Welles was because of his control freak attitude, but it results in some interesting decisions.

What's more, Citizen Kane is the first feature for most of the cast. There are actually a number of moments which I can point to and say, 'this is not featured in any other movie of the time'.

Rewind back to 1976, post-Watergate, the Arab oil embargo, deep recession, the Soviet Union on the march, and the era that saw the invention of the terms malaise, misery index, and stagflation. To make matters worse, all this economic and foreign policy decline was occurring on the bicentennial of our nation's founding. Along comes a movie about a lowly amateur boxer who earns just enough to pay for his hovel of a Philadelphia apartment as a collection agent for a loan-shark, using his menacing size as the penalty for debtors slow to pay back their loans and gigantic interest. Yes, it's the classic underdog story, and yet Stallone - who both wrote the script and played the starring role - and director John Aldiss somehow managed to craft a movie that allows the audience to fall into believing the story and cheering enthusiastically to the end. Incredibly, they managed to produce this movie for a grand total of one million dollars, a shoestring budget by even the standards of the time, and somehow that only added to the realism. This movie also saw - for the first time in a major film - the use of a brand new technological innovation the Steadycam That particular innovation greatly enhanced the illusion that the audience is literally running alongside Stallone as he runs through the seedy neighborhoods of Philadelphia, getting in shape for the big fight with the Heavyweight Champion, Apollo Creed. It turns out that the set they used for Stallone's apartment was not really a set at all, but in fact a genuinely shabby hole. There is litter in the streets, too, and that only enhances the point that this is a real nobody trying to show that he can be a somebody. There is also a love interest in this movie, played perfectly by Talia Shire as Adrian. When Stallone first sees her, she is a dowdy young woman wearing hideous cat lady glasses, frumpy clothes, and (worst of all) a gray wool watch cap. She is also extremely shy and reluctant to respond to Rocky's affections. Somehow Rocky sees through through all that, and (later) also shows that Adrian is in fact a strikingly beautiful woman. As Rocky courts Adrian, Heavyweight Champ Apollo Creed (played brilliantly by Carl Weathers) is growing bored with the routine nature of selecting his next challenger. Creed takes the daring (and very smart) move of deciding to do something radical by offering an unknown the chance to fight him for a shot at the title. Creed knows that this will only draw more fans because of its unusual nature, plus he is cocky enough to believe that the challenger will be a cinch to defeat. Rocky at first does not want to do this, since he senses what is really going on, plus he also realizes that he is being used as a prop for a kind of publicity stunt. However, he also realizes what this would mean for him, and retired trainer Mickey (the role of a lifetime from the great Burgess Meredith) talks him into it, with himself as the trainer. Mickey himself had boxed quite a bit in his youth, never quite reaching the big time, and he sees in Rocky the opportunity for both of them to reach it. The story progresses from there, Rocky at first in agony as he struggles to run even a short distance, the Bill Conti soundtrack expertly conveying the lonely pain of an out of shape contender. Later, under Mickey's instruction and with confidence building, the soundtrack becomes upbeat with the now familiar Gonna Fly Now propelling it along. As all this happens, it really is hard to remember that this is only a movie, and the final ten minutes are some of the finest in movie history. I will not spoil this for those who have never seen it, except to say that the ending is absolutely perfect, and I am unembarrassed to admit that even now I get a bit misty when I see it. Again, getting back to the context of the time that this movie was released, I suspect that if this movie had come out in 1996 instead of 1976, it might not have gained the iconic status it now enjoys. Yes, it's true, the story of Rocky nicely mirrors that of America as a whole, and that makes it all the more appealing. And I don't care if I get derided as some kind of flag waver for having written that. If you have not had the chance to see this movie, you owe it to yourself to grab a copy and watch. Another point that should be mentioned is that this is neither a guy flick nor a chick flick, but instead a perfect blend. It's terrific to watch alone, as a couple, or a whole crowd.

To make sure we can't follow everything and strain out eyes, there is no other reason. Sure photographers make black and white pictures, but only because making something black and white can have several meanings, but this doesn't happen with movies.There is also a message in this movie. A message I draw is Ignorance is Bliss and Don't be obsessed with something, you might find it everywhere. I like the second message, but I don't like the first. The other thing is, the guy in the movie goes insane, but he was already insane from the beginning. His obsession didn't cause that.The movie felt like a giant waste of time. And I want to save you your time by telling you not to watch this.

Many users have remarked on the padding that needlessly prolongs the movie, particularly the scenes involving Minerva, the hoodoo practitioner. To that I would add (as being mostly irrelevant) the transvestite entertainer The Lady Chablis. Ironically, however, this padding provides the only real interest the film offers.The acting is good enough. As eccentric millionaire Jim Williams, Kevin Spacey is quite convincing. I have never seen Mr. Spacey give a bad performance. I first saw him in a made-for-tv movie portraying disgraced PTL founder Jim Bakker. That was many years ago, but to this day when I think of Jim Bakker, I picture Kevin Spacey.Producer and director Clint Eastwood should be taken to task for twisting some of the facts. The story is told from the perspective of John Kelso (John Cusack), a magazine reporter from New York who comes to Savannah to cover the annual Christmas party given by Jim Williams. Kelso is really John Berendt, the author of the book on which the movie was based. Berendt is gay, but Kelso is not. The only plausible reason for changing his sexual identity is commercial. Presumably more people (esp. women) will go to a movie featuring a straight man than a gay one, especially when there is romance involved. (Toward this end, a relationship between Kelso and a local woman named Mandy - played by Alison Eastwood - was fabricated for the movie.) While that is probably true, it is mercenary and deceitful, nonetheless.Another inaccuracy is that there were actually four trials, not one. The first trial ended in a guilty verdict and a sentence of life in prison, but was overturned on appeal. It wasn't until eight years after the murder that Williams was finally acquitted. Also, the movie implies that Williams died only days after the trial ended. In fact, he died some six months later. Lastly, the name of the victim was incorrect. His name was Danny Hansford, not Billy Hanson, as it was in the movie. This is a minor point, but I don't know why the name of the deceased was changed, while the name of the accused wasn't. Savannah was previously best known as the home of songwriter Johnny Mercer, and the town that Sherman spared after burning Atlanta. When Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil was published, and even more so after the movie came out, Savannah became known as the city where an infamous murder took place. Interested parties can even take a guided tour of the important sites associated with the crime and trials.

The villagers get the idea to hire Samurai to protect them from the bandits.

There is an air of distrust that lingers throughout the movie, a feeling of unwelcome from both the villagers and the Samurai.

A theatre production, with the limited scope of the stage, must convey action, place and meaning through its words. A motion picture, being a primarily visual affair, must make its images speak without getting bogged down in too much dialogue. How then to translate a stage play to the screen without giving the script a complete overhaul? Enter director George Cukor. Cukor was undoubtedly the finest director when it came to theatre adaptations, and the studio trusted him well enough to turn him loose on barely adulterated material. He plays some of his neatest tricks in the first twenty minutes. During William Holden's interview with Broderick Crawford, the screen is filled with various flunkies rushing about doing Crawford's business. These are not merely here for background detail &#x96; the camera actually follows them more than it is does Holden and Crawford. It's a lively and cunning way of distracting us from Crawford's words &#x96; it isn't really important that we memorise every fact about this character, more that we get an impression of what he is really about. However in the following scene with Judy Holliday, everything is still and uncluttered, focusing us entirely on her and what she has to say.This is not to put down Garson Kanin's play. Born Yesterday is a beautifully structured piece, wonderfully simple and direct in its delineation of characters and situations. It describes Billie's blossoming as a genius at a credible pace without ever duplicating a moment, with every scene having a slightly different thrust. It's also a refreshingly mature and non-patronizing story of a female emancipation. Feminist purists may point out that Billie is arguably liberated by her male tutor, but she is nevertheless undoubtedly an independent actor in control of her own life, possessing of natural intelligence that was waiting to be given form. Besides, the tale of a stereotypical blonde bimbo getting one over on the chauvinistic boar she lives with is too good to resist.And what makes Billie's story work best of all is her portrayal by real-life blonde intellect Judy Holliday. At first glance Holliday is a graceless, squawking menace, in a similar vein to the Jean Hagen character from Singin' in the Rain. But while Lena Lamont is unquestionably a villain, Holliday makes Billie an engaging and above all likable individual. More than that Holliday skilfully brings out the humanity and touching realism in the caricature. While Holliday subtly feels out her performance, Broderick Crawford is more an actor of gesture and mannerism, filling the space with his larger-than-life presence. Next to these two, William Holden is almost a little bland in his steady professionalism, but this doesn't matter, as it's not his character who is required to shine.When we see a stage to screen adaptation, even a good one, its roots are usually obvious in the long passages of dialogue and lack of scene changes. Born Yesterday however moves with such pace and draws us in so successfully, you could be forgiven for thinking it was written directly for the screen. It is one of Cukor's best and the finest record one could hope for of the seldom-seen talents of Judy Holliday. It also holds its own in a year of so many fine dramas, and deserves to be remembered alongside All About Eve and Sunset Boulevard.

But there was a lot of work done on the project after his death, which probably explains why this attempt to recapture the Mary Poppins magic doesn't quite reach it.I saw the restored, 140 minute version. While I usually approve of restorations, I have to wonder if the 30 or so restored minutes really helped. For one thing, there is not much story in this long version, and frequently the little story there is comes to a screeching halt. Younger kids may also not understand the war theme that runs through the movie. There is also a curious matter-of-fact feeling to much of the movie, which means the feeling of magic is diminished. And what's up with the opening credits, that spoil what happens in the last part of the movie? Still, the acting is good, even with the child actors. There are some songs by the Sherman brothers that are pleasant to listen to, even if they don't match the greatness of the songs in Mary Poppins. And there are some good special effects, some of which are amazing even in this age of computer animation.

Younger kids may also not understand the war theme that runs through the movie. There is also a curious matter-of-fact feeling to much of the movie, which means the feeling of magic is diminished. And what's up with the opening credits, that spoil what happens in the last part of the movie? Still, the acting is good, even with the child actors. There are some songs by the Sherman brothers that are pleasant to listen to, even if they don't match the greatness of the songs in Mary Poppins. And there are some good special effects, some of which are amazing even in this age of computer animation.

That's probably because Walt was still alive and supervising the project when it was started in the early '60s. But there was a lot of work done on the project after his death, which probably explains why this attempt to recapture the Mary Poppins magic doesn't quite reach it.I saw the restored, 140 minute version.

Caine book. Caine wrote about the darker sides of the feminine sensibility quite removed from the stereotype of the pure virgin whose reason d'etre is to become the stay-at-home wife working in the kitchen, having children, and waiting for her husband. Love them or hate them, Caine's female characters are ambitious, sexual, driving, sometimes amoral and even occasionally criminal. In Mildred Pierce, Caine grabs the idea of the stereotypical American Female, turns it on its head, smashes it, and finally burns it up until it is such a crumbled mess on the floor that it no longer even remotely resembles what it had been in the first place. This darker view of womanhood was somewhat challenged by the likes of Doris Day in her films of the 1950's but could not overshadow the femme fatale of the 1940's. Thank God.In Mildred Pierce, the title character (played by Joan Crawford in the film of her career) is the strongest, the toughest, the most intelligent, the most hard-driving, and the most ambitious of the entire cast. As we learn, we find that her drive is motivated out of necessity rather than greed or social status. Right behind her is her daughter Veda who turns out to be almost as strong-willed as her mother, yet her desires center around money, luxury and recognition. Simultaneously, most of the males are wimps. These men if men they can be called are not exactly pawns, but rather they are direction-less and irresolute individuals, vulnerable to Pierce and her daughter Veda. The males cling to the advantage that their sex still had in the 1940's but they can sense it is slipping away from them. Mildred Pierce is a new breed of woman, willing to take matters into her own hands. They cling to Mildred often because of what she can provide for them rather than a desire to take care of her, ultimately reversing the traditional roles of men and women.The opening scene gets you hooked immediately, and I'm really giving nothing away as what follows happens in less than the first minute of screen time. A nicely dressed man in dinner clothes is shot and killed at some kind of vacation house at night. We don't know who he is, why he's there, or why he's been murdered. And we don't see who killed him. The film cuts to a car outside the house where a woman who looks one helluva lot like Joan Crawford gets in and drives away. She eventually returns to the scene of the murder with another man who appears to be someone she knows very well. She then locks him inside the house and makes a hasty getaway. Evenutally there is an investigation and Crawford is brought to a precinct for questioning. It is there she tells her story that began four years before the events at the vacation house. Most of the film is as flashback.Her story begins with Mildred's life as a devoted wife of the rather spineless Bert Pierce and mother of two beautiful daughters, the younger a tomboy and the older having refined tastes. For her hard work and loyalty, Mildred loses her weak-willed husband who is a failure in the business world. He feels guilty for not being able to provide for his family so triangulates with another woman, presumably to escape from his obligations and his shortcomings. We gradually learn their eldest daughter Veda longs for luxury and aspires to become a member of the rich and affluent. She feels dissatisfied at her middle class life. After separating from her husband, Mildred joins the workforce and eventually opens her own restaurant business, all the while resisting the pursuits of sex-hungry and money-hungry males. She rarely fulfills their sexual appetites but often gives them money. One of Mildred's suitors, Monty, is a moneyed do-nothing who wants Mildred's affections but doesn't want the responsibility that goes with it. Then her daughter becomes closer to Monty while she is simultaneously dating a wealthy boy from the upper-crust. Her beau is as wimpy as the other males but he has millions.This film is completely engrossing, absorbing, and unpredictable thanks to a first-rate screenplay and an absolutely tour-de-force performance by Crawford who stays completely in character. Even when she engages extraordinary behavior, for some reason she projects complete honesty. The stay-at-home wife and mother trans-morphs into a being far more intelligent and resourceful than most of her male counterparts, with the exception of only one character. And she is always at risk while the males in her life don't quite know what to do with themselves. Ann Blyth as the beautiful yet materialistic and ulterior-motivated daughter Veda keeps with up with Crawford stride-for-stride. She, like her screen mother, is no stereotype wall flower. She has the savvy and shrewdness to manipulate situations to achieve what she desires. These women are anything but white-gowned blushing virgins. If she saw this movie, Doris Day must have wept.

It's also a film that pays constant homage to Hitchcock's best work, notably Rear Window and Psycho. The most important lines occur early in the film when the protagonist, Kyle MacLachlan, tells Laura Dern that he needs to investigate the mysterious circumstances surrounding Isabella Rosselli because knowledge requires risk but with the possible reward that you might learn something. By the end of the narrative, MacLachlan's character should have learned a lot, but here's where Lynch flinches, much like Robert Altman in the conclusion to The Player. MacLachlan emerges neither a sadder nor wiser man from his rite of passage and his descent into the dark corners of the psyche. Instead, Lynch commits the ultimate cynical sin, reprising the film's innocent opening and throwing in the viewer's face the hopelessly artificial, Pollyanna-ish, pastoral idyl that is most likely the preferred reality of the American mainstream movie consumer.This is not the place for a detailed analysis of the film, though some of the following may help the viewer make sense of the narrative. Jeff confronts first mortality (his father stricken by a life-threatening stroke), then a severed, decaying human ear. The ear, the organ of hearing, is also the sense that fully awakens only in the dark, granting access to the Dionysian, the deep intuitive wellsprings of the self. But the ear we see on screen has become a diseased, useless instrument in a sunny culture whose idea of music is Bobby Vinton's version of Blue Velvet. Rossellini's alternative version of the song, with all of its sensuous, alluring darkness, will draw MacLachlan in to the same degree that it repells girl friend Dern (contrast this relationship with that of Jimmy Stewart and Grace Kelly in Rear Window, where Kelly becomes increasingly drawn to the voyeuristic and ghoulish activity initiated by Stewart). Soon MacLaclan will discover the love substitutes embodied by both Rossellini and Hopper--the sadism and masochism, fetishism and scopophilia that, like it or not, are present in every son and daughter who has inherited from birth and learned from upbringing the pleasure\/pain principle that underlies even the most well-intentioned, selfless love (the absence of any shown feelings between MacLaclan and either parent is another tip-off to the basis of his attraction to the dominitrix\/sex slave character played by Rossellini).Certainly Lynch must know, along with every other artist who has dealt with the theme, the risk along with the necessity of making touch with these feelings in order to achieve a fuller, richer, more knowing life in the time one has left. MacLaclan tells the naive and shielded Dern from the beginning that it's extremely dangerous business (think of Mann's Death in Venice). But the alternative is a Salem where everybody is good, a Lumberton where people get sick but never die, a Disney fantasy that can exist only in artificial movies. Lynch may have thought he was being ironically clever by giving his viewers the escape they probably crave. I'd say cowardly is more like it. This film (in fact, most any other film since 1980) is easily eclipsed by his own Elephant Man, where both the screenplay and the circumstances of the historical John Merrick insured the right ending.

In the end, however, the story is not as tragic as it might have been if one or two things had happened differently.The acting is uniformly excellent. Michael Wilding is handsome and dashing, with a generosity of spirit that is uplifting. Ingrid Bergman is wonderful as a fine lady with a tormented soul, who has fallen into alcoholism. And Joseph Cotten shines as her long-suffering, devoted husband.Visually, the film is a little disappointing. It has a washed-out look, and would probably benefit from a thorough restoration. The exterior shots are obviously paintings. But none of this matters very much, compared with the intensity of the emotions on the screen.In one respect, Under Capricorn is the reverse of another Hitchcock film starring Joseph Cotten. In Shadow of a Doubt he plays a guilty man who, at first, is thought to be innocent. In this movie, it is the exact opposite. There is also a similarity to another Hitchcock film starring Ingrid Bergman. In Notorious, Bergman's character is essentially held prisoner by her Nazi husband, played by Claude Rains. She is liberated at the end by Cary Grant. In this film, her character is a virtual prisoner of the housekeeper, who plies her with alcohol so she will remain helpless, and she herself can be in control. This time her rescuer is Michael Wilding. ","genre":null},{"date":"1 May 2010","score":"0 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" Under Capricorn is a great drama.

Renee Zellweger is flawless as the naive, sweet, but utterly detached young woman named Betty who is addicted to a soap opera called A Reason to Love. This seems sweet enough, but her husband is a jerk (totally) and things start to spiral, and get dizzy, as reality even for the viewer starts to shift ground.Not that you are ever confused about what is happening or who the good guys are. The good guys are not Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock, for sure, as this unlikely and comedic father and son duo get involved, incidentally at first, in Betty's strange inner and outer life. A chase of sorts ensues, the soap opera becomes reality, and then reality becomes soap opera. And it's really hilarious and inventive and fast paced.Is it a total work of genius? Probably not. Maybe Charlie Kaufman would have added another twist in there (I'm not sure how), and certainly some of the side characters could have seemed less cardboard, or less awkward as actors. But Zellweger is unbelievable (really, your jaw might drop at how convincing she could play her mental blindness, and her awakening, of sorts). And Morgan Freeman is his usually convincing and engaging self. The utterly disgusting violence of one 20 second scene might turn off some viewers near the beginning, but if you can keep watching, the movie gets better from there. Much better.
