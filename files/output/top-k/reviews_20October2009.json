[{"date":"20 October 2009","score":"","review":" Recap The Martin's have just bought a brand new NDR114, a household robot, which they call Andrew. But a small peculiarity in Andrew's positronic brain makes him unique. It starts with a show of creativity and initiative but grows. Soon Andrew becomes part of the family and develops a own personality. But he wants more, he wants freedom and feelings. Around him time goes by, people grow up, grow old and eventually die. This start out to be the final quest and conflict for Andrew, why have feelings when everyone vanishes?Comments A very sweet movie. Actually a very sweet, warm and a little funny movie with quite some emotion and feeling. At least the second half is. The problem is that it takes very long until it really gets interesting. The entire first half feels like a very long introduction. It's too predictable and full of clichés. A robot working in a close and understanding family. What do you think will happen? I almost wanted to turn it off sometimes, as it didn't seem to have any ambition or promise to show any potential. Quite unlike Andrew that is.And that would have been too bad. Because the second half is quite different. As mentioned above it is very warm. Sweet and quite full off emotion. It's a bit ironic, and not so little weird, that it doesn't happen until Andrew's second try. He couldn't connect with Little Miss but then succeeds with her look alike granddaughter. But if you manage to forget that idea, it is actually quite charming. It is ironic that what I felt like a little weird is actually one of the main issues Andrew fights with. His immortality and inhumanity.Well, all in all, it's a good movie. Robin Williams is good as the developing robot. But the movie is a little too long, especially since the first half is completely uninteresting. The second half makes up for it, but not completely.6\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"20 October 2009","score":"","review":" Recap The Martin's have just bought a brand new NDR114, a household robot, which they call Andrew.
