Korine really shows here what can be done with film when he pushes the limits -- and in so pushing the limits he still comes up with a very good film that I feel is better than his first (Gummo). Not only is the film a sort of commentary on mental illness and differences in general, but it is also an infinitely intriguing film. What stands out about this film is that through its' often very surreal experiences you can often find greater bits of reality in it; I felt that the film embraced a sense of total freedom that one needs for it really to be Art, but still had a concise guidance that made it very viewable and entertaining at the same time.

What should I see? this movie is invariably in the elitist list. Its use of light and color is, indeed, a true study of cinematic technique and style. So what?! The one good idea Argento had (the imagery) was simply not enough to cover for the total lack of script, acting talent, meaningful dialog, horrible direction of these actresses, and the downright cheese-filled all-out crap&#150;fest that is Suspira.SPOILERS ABOUNDIn the first death scene, the acting was the most puerile trash I've ever witnessed (and I've SEEN Killer Klowns from Outer Space). These girls did not die well, prettily, or with grace. In fact, they didn't die with talent, either. The death scenes were nothing but an indication to me that this should have been the death of the movie. There simply aren't words for how horribly these girls portrayed their parts. Honestly, if the red-head had actually fallen that far with a cord attached around her neck, the weight of her body would have popped her head off her neck, rather than the sloppy inane banality we were given.Inane banality actually sums up the entirety of this movie. I cannot believe how highly recommended this trite piece of garbage is in the horror field. This was actually much, MUCH worse than I Still Know What You Did Last Summer,which was a total waste of my time. A friend, who watched this garbage with me observed, You know, Fiend? Aside from no one being naked, this really reminds me of a porno. Okay, hence the exploitation feel of this film. I don't care. How could I possibly care? The atmosphere everyone raves about just came off as a really bad porn and nothing more. Nothing could have saved this film from Argento's lack of talent but a really good remake. Hopefully, they won't make the mistake of assuming that this was, in any way, to be considered artsy. The acting quality is nonexistent and the screen play should have been exorcised and then buried in about 7 tons of salt, if you ask me. Even the ballerinas were inept.

Like many of these movies it has a beautiful cast but story-wise lacks just that little extra that would lift it from the Valley of Average Movies. Andy Garcia is a fine hero, Chris Walken is a wonderful villain and Gabrielle Anwar is a beautiful love-interest (even sporting a Norwegian name, Dagney!). But the only time there is any real zing and panache is when Walken does his thing, and whenever Treat Williams and Steve Buscemi are on-screen.Williams gives a refreshing turn as 'Critical Bill', a man who thinks with his fists (you should see what he does at the mortuary where he works) and delivers such over-the-top lines like I am Godzilla, you are Japaaan! with great gusto. Buscemi is a cold-blooded hit-man who's willing to shoot you up the ass just so you can take an extra twenty minutes to die a most painful death. Yes, there is something rotten in the state of Colorado.But director Gary Fleder doesn't manage to build any real tension, maybe because the story doesn't ring true. It goes off to a great start, with a dirty job that goes terribly wrong, but as the rest of the plot plays out it becomes evident that the only true climax of the movie was the above mentioned scene. The remaining hour is sadly predictable, and there are too many easy solutions plot-wise. How did you find me? asks one character who's gone underground to escape the wrath of 'The Man with the Plan' (Walken). Good question, I was wondering that very same thing! Of course the movie jump-cuts to the characters talking on another subject, thus by-passing tricky questions like that. Maybe the film-makers would argue that it isn't about these small things, but I disagree. This is all sand in the machinery and in the end it bogs down a cinematic journey that should have been great. But again you find yourself watching because of that classy cast.Director Fleder of course, would go on to do greater things, such as Kiss the Girls and Runaway Jury. Screenwriter Scott Rosenberg would go on and write Con Air, High Fidelity and uhm... eh... Kangaroo Jack, but that's besides the point.In the end, Things to Do in Denver When You're Dead is all about style, great actors, and very little else. Oh, and I guess it's worth the price alone just to witness the scene where Treat Williams describes what it's like to eat s***.I kid you not, he really does.6\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"19 October 2004","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" This is one of those movies that came in the wake of Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction, with cool-looking people dressed in suits going around killing each other.

But the only time there is any real zing and panache is when Walken does his thing, and whenever Treat Williams and Steve Buscemi are on-screen.Williams gives a refreshing turn as 'Critical Bill', a man who thinks with his fists (you should see what he does at the mortuary where he works) and delivers such over-the-top lines like I am Godzilla, you are Japaaan! with great gusto. Buscemi is a cold-blooded hit-man who's willing to shoot you up the ass just so you can take an extra twenty minutes to die a most painful death. Yes, there is something rotten in the state of Colorado.But director Gary Fleder doesn't manage to build any real tension, maybe because the story doesn't ring true. It goes off to a great start, with a dirty job that goes terribly wrong, but as the rest of the plot plays out it becomes evident that the only true climax of the movie was the above mentioned scene. The remaining hour is sadly predictable, and there are too many easy solutions plot-wise. How did you find me? asks one character who's gone underground to escape the wrath of 'The Man with the Plan' (Walken). Good question, I was wondering that very same thing! Of course the movie jump-cuts to the characters talking on another subject, thus by-passing tricky questions like that. Maybe the film-makers would argue that it isn't about these small things, but I disagree. This is all sand in the machinery and in the end it bogs down a cinematic journey that should have been great. But again you find yourself watching because of that classy cast.Director Fleder of course, would go on to do greater things, such as Kiss the Girls and Runaway Jury. Screenwriter Scott Rosenberg would go on and write Con Air, High Fidelity and uhm... eh...

I saw his only big movie besides this, the 1978 Oscar winner Days of Heaven in 1995, when I was sixteen. I thought it was immediately the most incredible movie I'd ever seen. Not because it was flashy, or impressive in any way, but because it was real, and harsh and told you the inescapable truth, no matter how you wanted to run.At the time this incredible invention called the Internet wasn't so readily available (I didn't really get to using it until 1999), so I was searching high and low for more movie by this incredible guy called Malick, but I never found any. So when I finally heard the name Terrence Malick uttered in connection with this movie in the summer of 1998. My old memories came flooding back, and my excitement rose when I heard of the incredible cast, which is immediately the first incredible plus that this movie carries around. The cast is simply awe inspiring. Sean Penn, Nick Nolte, John C. Reilly, Woody Harrelson, John Cusack, John Travolta and George Clooney were some of the big names this movie offered. In addition this movie contains a large amount of then unknown but now big actors like Jim Caviezel (Passion of the Christ), Adrien Brody (The Pianist) and Jared Leto (Requiem for a Dream, and soon Alexander). And even beyond that it offered even great performances from actor who I'd never seen before, and haven't seen since like Elias Koteas, Ben Chaplin, John Dee Smith and Arie Verveen. With such a terrific cast of names Terrence Malick didn't surrender the movie to them, but kept all the parts in balance, or even gave the emphasis to some of the smaller names, as Jim Caviezel arguably has the largest part and hadn't even acted in a major movie until then.When I finally went to see the near three hour movie I can only say I was astounded by it. The movie hit me as 'Days of Heaven' did, with the realization that I'd seen something truthful and powerful, unlike 'Saving Ryan's Privates' which I'd seen several moths before, which, apart from the great opening scene, was a pretty bad movie which prays on stereotyped characters to advance a plot which only is about shooting and violence. When I saw this movie I felt profoundly touched by a deep realization I'd seen something the soldiers had really been through.The plot is rather simple. It is the story of the army that took Guadalcanal Island in the pacific in 1943, seen through the eyes of several soldiers. And with this incredible cast of unknowns and much-knowns we get something very unusual, namely an actor, not action, driven war movie. Much of the movie is not about the marines shooting up a bunch Japanese, as I said there is little plot, but an examination of what happens in between those rare moments when soldiers saw any action. But Don't get me wrong, there is action galore, including an hour long scene where the soldier's try to conquer a hill occupied by several Japanese gun emplacements. The story is not told by dialogue, but through he thoughts of the soldiers themselves, told through the narration.The movie is also very visually beautiful. Oscar winning cinematographer John Toll (Braveheart, Ledgends of the Fall) has created a veritable masterpiece of camera work.The movie is severely criticised for being too long and too slow paced. I do feel that those criticisms miss the point slightly. The point is that the soldiers never knew when they would be fighting again, and so the slow pacing, to emphasise the point that they weren't always in combat.Another criticism is that when you watch this movie its like flicking between the nature channel, history channel, and occasionally the psychology channel. Although this is partly true (the movie opens on a shot of a crocodile, and frequently intercuts to show animals, or wide landscapes) the movie clearly wants you to look beyond the realm of a Jean-Claude van Damme like shoot-up movie, nor would the movies point have worked if it had been about the shooting, like Saving Private Ryan.This movie is mainly a humanitarian movie. It shows mainly the contrast between life (the Malenesian scenes) and death (the battle scenes). It promotes life, but not by voicing it. It shows it strong and powerful message by showing how horrible war really was.A terrific movie, definitely a 9\/10 (maybe even a 10\/10), which is very high up on my list of all time favorite movie.

I was pleasantly surprised to discover Jude Law as Lord Alfred 'Bosie' Douglas as well, making this film highly appealing to the voyeurs of the world.

Instead, it cleverly builds suspense by having Lee as a guy who has sworn not to fight, and when he eventually cuts loose the result is exhilarating. However, it's obvious that none of Lee's opponents are a match for him and only the sequence when he battles a group of heavies in and around an ice factory really stands out.

In all three of Lee's Hong Kong films, violence never really solves things, it just makes things worse.

Powell was clearly influenced by Hitchcock's themes (someone actually discusses scopophilia--here pronounced 'scoptophilia'--in 'Peeping Tom' instead of simply depicting it) and style. Unfortunately, the overall production is just not up to the task. The plot is a little too heavy-handed and literal at times, the characters somewhat cartoonish, and the pacing leaden.Really, the biggest flaw with the film is the casting of Carl Boehm in the roll of Mark. Looking somewhat like the offspring of Joseph Cotton and Peter Lorre in one of 'Late Night with Conan O'Brien's 'If They Mated' routines, Boehm plays crazy all right. That the problem, though That's *all* he does. At no point did I believe that Mark is capable of holding down not one but two jobs. Perhaps the British standards of creeping out your fellow employees is different from ours here in the States, but the first time Mark locked eyes on me while mumbling in that high, lispy, vaguely accented voice of his, I'd be on the phone with Human Resources like that.What makes Norman Bates such a compelling character is that he does have the ability to function in society from time to time. He can be charming, friendly, and even funny when he wants to be. Mark, however, is incapable of any of these qualities. His timidity is so pronounced that it's hard to believe he could ever screw up the courage to actually kill someone because that would require human interaction. And the idea that anyone--even someone as apparently oblivious as or with the appallingly low standards of Helen--could actually fall in love with someone Mark is hard to accept. Marion definitely sympathizes with Norman, but it is a pitying sort of sympathy. She senses there's something not quite right about Norman, and because of that at no point can she ever feel a romantic attraction toward him. Norman is irreversibly deranged and without hope. 'Peeping Tom,' on the other hand, seems to suggest that Mark *can* lead a normal life and perhaps even have a girlfriend if he just stops his habit of killing women.

People drive to Johnstown just to see the War Memorial. Without a doubt one of the best sports movies of all time. Kinda like Brians song but with nothing but violence and vulgarity!

Until the moment where Edward picks up the snowflake globe and bashes in the head of his wife's young lover, it is her film, and like some Hardy tale, she finds herself a prisoner of an action in her past, in this case her immediate past. Then the focus shifts to her husband, not for as long a screen time as the affair, but to a second blow up, this one entirely verbal. Having noticed that her gift to the young man, the same gift Edward gave her, has appeared on her table again, she asks What did you do with that beautiful young man? Did you hurt him? The fury in his reply is unmistakable, and it clears the air of all the ambivalence that surrounds their lives, so that the final part of the film is about the couple, trying to patch a life together again. This is adult fare, not because of the steamy sex scenes, but for the themes and ideas brought out.Diane Lane carries the first half of the film. Richard Gere is supposed to be a cypher, a hanger-on and it is only when he sets foot into Olivier Martinez loft that he takes over the film. All three principals do a great job.Lynne and his cinematographer also set off the contrast between the world of lower Manhattan and that of Westchester County. The cut from adulterous wife getting off train to husband getting off a later train is beautifully done.This is one of the better films of the past two years.

I always thought that was kind of interesting. This movie is so great. I do agree in some ways that it is more of an adult film with all the satire involved. I also wonder what did Charlie's Grandparents do about using the restroom if they occording to Charlies Mom had not been out of the bed in twenty years. Wonka says to Charlie at the end of the movie that only an adult could take over the factory because an adult would want to do things his own way. Plus I think that Wonka pre chose the winners, how else would Mr Sluggworth know were all the winners were as soon as they found the golden tickets???
