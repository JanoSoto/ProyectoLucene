[{"date":"31 July 1999","score":"12 out of 13 people found the following review useful","review":" Leo (Kevin McKidd), handsome, gay, and a bit vacuous, turns 30, still without a special someone in his life. His West London flatmates, the ragingly camp Darren (Tom Hollander) and liberated flight attendant Angie(Julie Graham) throw a surprise birthday party for him. Leo is mortified and retires to his room to watch TV -  the place is full of people I don't want to see. We see why this is by way of flashback through the past few months of Leo's life. Highlights include some very funny scenes in a new age mens' encounter group facilitated with voyeuristic aplomb by Keith (Simon Callow), an affair with Brendan, a hunky Irish cafe owner (an unrecognisable James Purefoy), and reunion with an old female flame Sally (Jennifer Ehle). Tucked into this plotline are the sexual adventures of Darren and real estate agent Jeremy (a straight acting Hugo Weaving). Their scene is making love in the houses Jeremy has for sale while the owners are out, until one day an owner unexpectedly returns with Darren still handcuffed to the bedposts. Darren explains himself as an S & M a-gram sent to the wrong address.The theme of the film is gender bending. Sexual identity is not set in concrete and given the right circumstances and person many of us can swing between gay and straight. This is hardly an original insight but this film tackles the issue with zest and a great sense of fun. A highlight was the men's group back to the wilderness camp, where the men, having failed to find anything to eat in the forest, call up for Chinese takeaway on a mobile phone. A few things grate. Keith's wife (Harriet Walter), author of a book called The Obsolete Penis seems to have strayed in from another movie and Brendan looked a bit too disheveled to be the front man in a trendy cafe operation.Rose Troche, responsible for the rather didactic lesbian comedy Go Fish, directs with a much lighter touch here and takes full advantage of Robert Farrer's light hearted but occasionally poignant script. The tone is comedy rather than comic and we do care a bit at the end how it's going to work out for Leo, colourless as he is. Compared with a conventional romantic comedy like Notting Hill this film derives its tension from the unexpected rather than the inevitable, and gives the audience a lot more stimulation on the way. As for me, I'll never entrust the keys of my house to a real estate agent again.

He always gets a plethora of name actors that wave their normal fees just to be in his films.  But why?  What is the intrigue?  Where is the greatness that you would think his films should stun us with?  I have never admired Woody Allen films.  Never.  I enjoyed Husbands and Wives and Crimes and Misdemeanors.  Everything else, including the abyssmal Annie Hall, I find pretentious, silly and so incredibly boring.  Deconstructing Harry was one of the worst films I have ever seen, and even though this film isn't as bad DH, it is still awful.  What I don't understand is why Hollywood producers continue to fund Allen films.  Do they actually make money?  Does the studio ever turn in a profit after all is said and done?  I don't see how.  And at first it surprised me as to all the positive comments on here about this flick, but then I realized that it is only hard core, die hard Allen fans that will comment on this piece of garbage anyway.  So it is only natural that most of the people in here are going to like Celebrity, because they already like Woody Allen as it is.  I guess that would be like me seeing a Bill Paxton film, no matter how bad it is, I will always like it ( by the way, there are no bad Bill Paxton films!!!).  Celebrity is a film about one character going through a journey after his marriage breaks up.  And of course his marriage is in shambles because of infidelity.  What else could it possibly be?  After all, even though I could never believe that Allen could ever get a fraction of the women on screen that he has, his characters are always screwing everything that moves.  At least Brannaugh is at handsome enough that you can see how he could bed some of the women in here, but still.....Celebrity is slow, pointless and pretty much awful.  When Allen has his brilliant final shot, it was supposed to be symbolic of the main characters life.  To me it was symbolic of how I felt by sitting through this film.****  There is one final comment that I have to make.  It has little to do with the film itself except to say that it concerns Leonardo DiCaprio.  Why is it that Hollywood is claiming that he is now the hottest star in the world?  They claim it because Titanic was the biggest film ever made and teenage girls were throwing themselves at him.  People say that he is going to be the next Tom Cruise or Will Smith in terms of box office appeal.  But do people not remember that it was the film that made Titanic as great as it was, and as good he was in it, he was but one part of the movie.  If that was true ( that he made the film the hit that he did ) then Celebrity would have made 100 million just from his name alone.  But it didn't.  It didn't because young women don't want to see him in this kind of role, they want to see him in Titanic.  If you remember before Titanic, he was always considered a great actor that no one really knew about.  But now he is in Titanic and  Oh my God, he is the hottest thing since Marlon Brando from the 50's.  Tell me why no one went to see Celebrity if Leo is so hot.  Why?  I'll tell you why.  Because Leo is not as hot as people say and think and because Celebrity is not a good movie.  That's all I got to say about that.
