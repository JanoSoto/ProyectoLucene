It was the first David Lynch movie I ever saw, thought at the time I'd never even heard about 'Eraserhead' and knew nothing about the guy. I was incredibly impressed by the film, as I have been every time I watch it. Eventually I became a big Lynch fan, and could see the similarities between 'Eraserhead' and 'The Elephant Man', both visually and in their use of sound. Apart from that, they are very different movies. 'Eraserhead' still freaks most people out, but 'The Elephant Man' is arguably his most accessible film. It has heart and an emotional impact, something rare in Lynch's movies ('The Straight Story' is another exception). Anthony Hopkins is an actor I've frankly had it up to HERE with, especially after his increasingly hammy Dr. Hannibal Lecter, but boy, is he wonderful here! Probably his finest performance to date. Of course John Hurt is superb too, especially taking into consideration him having to work under pounds of make up. It's hard to fault anybody in the supporting cast, especially John Gielgud and Hannah Gordon, who plays Hopkins wife. Freddie Jones, who Lynch has worked with a few times since, is really evil as Bytes, and the late Michael Elphick ('The Element Of Crime', 'Withnail and I') plays another memorable baddie as the hospital's night porter. 'The Elephant Man' is a remarkable achievement. Lynch doesn't seem to have compromised his unique vision one bit and yet manages to make a genuinely moving drama about one of the screen's most unlikely heroes. I don't throw the term masterpiece around lightly but it's difficult not to use that word when describing this truly extraordinary film! Simply one of the best movies I've ever seen.

I can't stand Leelee Sobieski, seriously, ever since I saw Heaven on Earth, her face just, I can't describe it, she annoys the heck out of me. But I did decide rather than just complain through the whole movie, I would just try to sit and see maybe if the film could have been worth the watch at least, well, I was wrong.After losing their parents, Grace and Dave, in a car accident, Ruby and Rhett Baker are placed under the guardianship of Erin and Terry Glass, former neighbors\/parents' best friends and childless couple who live in a large glass house in Malibu. Life is great for both siblings at first. However, Ruby soon discovers that her new foster parents are after the siblings' $4 million trust fund. Ruby discovers that the car her parents died in was a BMW loaned from the Glass' company and suspects that Mr. Glass was responsible for their deaths. Mrs. Glass watches an old home video of her and Ruby on a beach, happy and healthy. Then, overwhelmed with guilt, she overdoses and dies. Ruby wakes up the next morning with Mrs. Glass' dead body lying next to her. Shocked to find his wife dead, Mr. Glass traps Ruby and Rhett in the basement. Eventually, the two escape. After a brutal car accident due to Mr. Glass tampering with his own car in the same fashion as he did with the kids' parents.Honestly, this movie is just a waste of time, it's a very mediocre thriller that is, well for me at least, is just very predictable.

Whenever this film appears on television I find myself helpless to turn the channel or shutoff the TV. I later found out that my father was good friends with Curtis Hanson, who played Elgin Perkens (Troys Father). He gave me a few little in-depth stories about the parts of the movie he was involved in and I found it quite interesting. I have seen this movie countless times and I was very pleased when the DVD was released and there were previously deleted scenes added.

Hong Kong action films in the 80's should be given a lot of praise because of what has been accomplished. I'm very happy to say that I'm a martial arts FANATIC!!!Yes Madam! (A.K.A.

The last fight says enough, it doesn't need to be explained. When I saw this movie for the first time, I rewinded that same scene at least 12 times to get that rush again.

I wish Hong Kong action films would repeat this formula again along with other movies.About the content of the movie Well, the movie is kind of on and off with action scenes. At times, I think the movie didn't know whether to be serious or be comedic. The scene with Sammo Hung, David Chiang, and Richard Ng should've been omitted. I liked the fact that Tsui Hark was in this movie. This is the only movie where I've seen him acting. He did a good job though. He interaction between aspirin and strepsil was funny enough.

I was disappointed that Gary Oldman's character (excellent) had only one big scene. Brad Pitt was fantastic, his character must be the coolest junkie I've ever seen on film (ok ok Johnny Depp was also terrific in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas). Also, most of these actors didn't even act together, which was a shame. The main characters are played by Christian Slater (not very good) and Patricia Arquette (ouch... how HOT can she get?).This film lives by flashes instead of the development of the story (which is pretty basic). For instance, the little chat between Christopher Walken and Dennis Hopper, the fight between Gandolfini and Arquette, the Oldman vs Slater scene, any scene with Brad Pitt, and finally, the ending, were all memorable.I saw this mainly because Quentin wrote it, but I guess that the Two Thumbs Up go to the director Tony Scott and the actors. Quentin made it possible, but they made it memorable. I guess it's just good team work.If you just want to know if you should watch this or if it is a waste of time, well, I guess I would definitely recommend it for the scenes I mentioned, but don't expect an amazing plot.
