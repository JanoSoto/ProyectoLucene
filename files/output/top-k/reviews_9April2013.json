But I just ignored it because I thought it was not what I was looking for. When I finally decided to see it, I immediately regretted not watching it any sooner. The film is heartbreaking and frustrating from the start, but in the end, you would truly feel redemption. You could feel the pain and injustice brought upon Andy, the protagonist. As I watched the movie, I felt as if I was in prison with him; I felt as if I've gone through the struggles that he went through as well. You could see how time is irrelevant in prison; you feel minutes go by when it's actually days, weeks, months, and years. And then you'll feel disappointed at all those years where you could have done something different in the world outside.The film is also an eye-opener. You open your eyes to what its like in prison; although, the prison in the movie seems more ideal than real life prisons. You get a glimpse of brutality and rape inside prison. You get to see how some prisoners become institutionalized and never seem to want to leave anymore. There is also a depiction of how rampant corruption is, and its sad to think that those involved are the ones who are supposed to be protecting and abiding by the law.The cast is great. I couldn't ask more from Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman. Even the other prisoners are good too. Overall, I think that the main point of this movie is never to lose hope; that hope is always a good thing. This movie is as equally good as Forrest Gump and Pulp Fiction (movies that were made in the same year as this), but I can't understand why only these two movies got most of the attention. All in all, this movie certainly is the kind of movie to watch before you die.

There is a slight exception from the poem and the movie, in the fact, that she lasted ten to 12 years in the military without getting discovered. Disney got it wrong in the settling as well, the ballad is set in the Northern-Southern dynasties period (420 to 589 AD), but Mulan the film makes it look like the height of the Ming dynasty a thousand years later. Oh, she also died tragically in the ballad. She commits suicide because the emperor asked her to be a concubine. But that's beside the point. I'm just history nerding. In the end, the story is the same, Mulan (Ming-Na Wen) must pretend to be a man to save her elderly father from death in the army due to invasion with the Huns and it's leader Shan Yu (Miguel Ferrer). Some people think of him as forgettable due to one of the relatively few Disney villains who doesn't have a villain song, but I like Shan Yu as a villain because he looks so scary. No, his personality isn't that great, but the dude just looks like a monster! And he's a powerhouse! He can slice through the castle pillars with one swing of his sword. He's the only Disney villain I can think of that actually causes that kind of destruction. He doesn't need to be fleshed out as a character. He's the leader of the Hun Army. The Huns were trying to conquer China and were really violent and underhanded in their tactics. He belongs with the greats. One thing that bugs me in the film is how Mulan go to the camp, and get nearly kicked out of the army for not being fit, which kinda negates, the whole point of her taking her father's place. Clearly, her father wasn't healthy so if he was sent instead of her, he would have been sent home anyways. So what was the point of replacing him? Why, didn't Mulan go home after not being fit to join the army? I think it's about giving Honor to the family. Mulan's smart in a way I can see, a cheater, a bit lazy, loving, outspoken, and just fails at all things social, but lovable. This 'wood orchid' seems like the girl-power type character for the overly feminist. If anything, I've always seen her as a person who was just trying to find her own place regardless of gender roles. She tries to act as her society's definition of a woman and fails, she tries to act as her society's definition of a man and fails. If anything, Mulan only succeeds when she acts like herself rather than the roles that are put before her. It isn't about the girl power or the male dominance, it's about people finding their own place in life. Mulan may be a strong female character, but I don't believe with Disney marketing her as a princess. Mulan appealed to some girls because she wasn't a princess. The title of Princess is really just more marketable, because Queens in Disney type movies are usually evil, while the Princess is a heroine. Still, Mulan is not a princess. For example, Mulan in the movie didn't like her kimono outfit and found it uncomfortable and it's only seen in the beginning of the film. And yet, most of the toys of her showed her in that outfit as opposed to her warrior one. For Disney to do that is kinda wrong. A lot of the hate has to do with gender roles. No matter how brave or action oriented or tomboyish princesses are, they still dress in pretty clothes and have beautiful hair and fall in love which isn't realism to the source material. The main musical theme Reflections is well written and expresses Mulan's feelings and desires with emotion. Even though it's like the other princess songs, it's still a great song. 'A girl worth fighting for' is just as good, but my favorite is 'Be a man'. Most badass song in Disney history. How come only guys can have no singing ability whatsoever but still make an awesome song? Was it really necessary for Shang to be shirtless for the entire duration of that song? Shang clearly had a thing for Mulan even during the time he didn't know she was indeed a she. Conclusion, Shang must be at least bi. Disney, you astonished me again. Want to know something interesting though, the voice actor for Captain Li Shang, was B.D. Wong, an actually an openly gay man in real life. So it was a bit odd in a while. The confusing gender roles jokes and visual gags closely border on PG, but it was funny. Another person who was funny was Eddie Murphy as Mushu, the Chinese Dragon. He did OK in the role, but couldn't they find a Chinese or Asian American comedian, that would fit the film, more. I don't mind the fact that the Chinese culture is underplayed. Speaking as an Asian, it's refreshing to see a work of media that takes place in an Asian setting without overplaying the stereotypes to the point of offensiveness. The film was generally well received by Chinese audiences. The fact that Jackie Chan put his pipes to work as the voice of the captain for the Mandarin dub didn't hurt either. The animation was breathtaking in some scenes, but others were missing the epic sheer artistry. All in all the film itself doesn't really do any harm to the source material or the culture it seeks to portray. I really liked that about it and continue to consider it one of Disney's better animated films of recent memory.

When they finally did, Star Trek The Motion Picture premiered to showcase a big, bold, extravagant spectacle, and a story that promised to be the end-all be-all Trek adventure.The problem is, watching this film has always been a weird experience. Despite the gorgeous model work and special effects, there really isn't much action to this, and the pacing overall is rather slow. Even at its smartest, the Star Trek series and all its future incarnations always had an adventurous spirit embedded with its stories; this movie strips away the adventure in favor of a strict and somewhat cold piece of hard sci-fi. There's little warmth, and certainly no real bang, to this picture.That being said, it still has its merits. The interstellar odyssey through the V'Ger cloud could be seen as something wondrous and awe-inspiring. The biggest draw to this film will be its story, which showcases a very clever high-concept premise with strong overarching philosophical themes of existence, purpose, and the human spirit.The plot holding these concepts up is a pretty standard affair, but is stretched rather thinly due to a number of lengthy scenes that could have easily been cut from the film. A lot of screen time is devoted to endless beauty shots of the Enterprise, there's a weird and silly scene where everybody's trapped in a wormhole for some odd reason, and there's a seemingly-pointless scene involving a transporter accident. What really throws me off, however, are the characters. The original cast is all here - Captain Kirk, Commander Spock, Dr. McCoy, Uhura, Checkov, Sulu, Scotty - but Spock is the only one of the lot who actually feels like a main character. In this movie, it's Decker and Ilia who take the center stage, and they go through a romantic spiel that borders on being sappy.Photography and editing are generally good in this film. Acting is disappointingly dry from the classic Trek crew, possibly because they're not given much to do as they are in the sequels. Leonard Nimoy is easily the biggest standout here; William Shatner does the best he can to make Captain Kirk cool again, and DeForest Kelley throws out some occasionally crass and witty lines. As the true main character, Stephen Collins comes off as rather dull. Persis Khambatta might be the best and most interesting performance here. Writing is not bad, especially regarding the high-brow aspects of the film, but it lacks a certain personality overall. This production has some rather gaudy costumes, but most sets, props, and special effects are great. Music is great too.In the same fashion as 2001 A Space Odyssey, I have to really be in the right mood to watch this film. Both 2001 and Star Trek The Motion Picture are space operas with very big special effects and very big ideas, but aren't that big on character building. As a Trek film, this first feature can be a rather dry and bewildering experience, especially if you're looking to see the original Enterprise crew in action.

Despite the gorgeous model work and special effects, there really isn't much action to this, and the pacing overall is rather slow. Even at its smartest, the Star Trek series and all its future incarnations always had an adventurous spirit embedded with its stories; this movie strips away the adventure in favor of a strict and somewhat cold piece of hard sci-fi. There's little warmth, and certainly no real bang, to this picture.That being said, it still has its merits. The interstellar odyssey through the V'Ger cloud could be seen as something wondrous and awe-inspiring. The biggest draw to this film will be its story, which showcases a very clever high-concept premise with strong overarching philosophical themes of existence, purpose, and the human spirit.The plot holding these concepts up is a pretty standard affair, but is stretched rather thinly due to a number of lengthy scenes that could have easily been cut from the film. A lot of screen time is devoted to endless beauty shots of the Enterprise, there's a weird and silly scene where everybody's trapped in a wormhole for some odd reason, and there's a seemingly-pointless scene involving a transporter accident. What really throws me off, however, are the characters. The original cast is all here - Captain Kirk, Commander Spock, Dr. McCoy, Uhura, Checkov, Sulu, Scotty - but Spock is the only one of the lot who actually feels like a main character. In this movie, it's Decker and Ilia who take the center stage, and they go through a romantic spiel that borders on being sappy.Photography and editing are generally good in this film. Acting is disappointingly dry from the classic Trek crew, possibly because they're not given much to do as they are in the sequels. Leonard Nimoy is easily the biggest standout here; William Shatner does the best he can to make Captain Kirk cool again, and DeForest Kelley throws out some occasionally crass and witty lines. As the true main character, Stephen Collins comes off as rather dull. Persis Khambatta might be the best and most interesting performance here. Writing is not bad, especially regarding the high-brow aspects of the film, but it lacks a certain personality overall. This production has some rather gaudy costumes, but most sets, props, and special effects are great. Music is great too.In the same fashion as 2001 A Space Odyssey, I have to really be in the right mood to watch this film. Both 2001 and Star Trek The Motion Picture are space operas with very big special effects and very big ideas, but aren't that big on character building. As a Trek film, this first feature can be a rather dry and bewildering experience, especially if you're looking to see the original Enterprise crew in action.

Filled with brilliant direction,great acting and a beautiful and haunting score Blue Velvet is David Lynch at his best.Set in the fictional town of Lumberton,U.S.A,Blue Velvet tells the story of a young man named Jeffrey Beaumont(Kyle MacLachlan)who has just returned home from college to see his Father in the hospital because his Father has just had a stroke. While in town,Jeffrey finds a severed ear in a backyard which leads into a dark mystery involving disturbed singer Dorothy Vallens(Isabella Rossellini)who is being held captive by sadistic criminal Frank Booth(Dennis Hopper). With the help from neighbor and friend Sandy(Laura Dern)Jeffrey is pulled into a dark and unsettling world which will change his life forever.Blue Velvet is a masterpiece that was a strange and different experience for cinema when it came out in 1986. When it came out audiences either loved it or were confused by it,critics were divided by the film where some critics called it a masterpiece while other critics hated it. In 1986 as well as the entire decade of the 80s was dominated by Hollywood Blockbusters and Independent cinema was more underground and Blue Velvet did not fit into either camp of a Hollywood Blockbuster or an independent film but in the camp of a David Lynch film. One of the reasons Blue Velvet is a great film and one of the greatest films ever made is because when you are watching the film you are pulled into a world of strange surrealism which Lynch is a master of. BV is a Film-Noir,but a new kind-of Film-Noir where instead of taking place of a big city BV takes place in the safe haven of the suburbs. In this film the suburbs and the small town is portrayed as a nice,calm beautiful place where there is nothing wrong but underneath the beauty is dark and disturbing world where danger is around every corner. BV gives viewers a Mystery where the characters are threatened by violence and sex and is so perverse that as a viewer you want to look away but you just can't. BV is a brilliant film that pulls you into a experience or trip into a world of darkness and disturbing weirdness and as you watch the film you are truly mesmerized while at the same time you are frightened by what you are watching and it's an experience you will never forget. BV is an amazing film that not only challenges you physically but mentally as well because when you watch the film there some moments where you as the viewer want to look away but you can't because you as the viewer are interested in what happens next. The character Jeffrey is pretty much like us the viewers who are watching these events go on and can't really understand why these things are happening. Like Jeffrey we are asking why does a person like Frank Booth exist and why is there so much trouble in this world? Jeffrey is a great character because in the beginning Jeffrey is just a typical young man who is innocent and he assumes he's living in a safe Paradise,but as the film goes on Jeffrey begins losing his innocence as he continues investigates the world of Frank and Dorothy and discovers a world different from his which changes his outlook on life. Where Jeffrey represents light and good,Frank represents dark and evil. Lynch's films are paintings coming to life and Lynch gives the film beautiful and haunting imagery whether it is using different colors including red and blue or mental and physical images like fire or the violence that happens to the characters. Lynch also balances the beauty of the light and ugliness of the dark where during the daytime in the light there are beautiful images of red roses and white picket fences and in the dark of night we see disturbing things like harsh lighting and other crazy things that involve Frank and his bizarre adventures. The ending is great and is filled with suspense and cinematic beauty but feels like an amazing dream coming to life and will be in your mind after viewing the film and is one of the reasons Blve Velvet is a Masterpiece.The whole cast is amazing in their roles. Kyle MacLachlan is excellent as Jeffrey,with MacLachlan bringing sympathy,depth and intensity to the role. Isabella Rossellini is fantastic,sexy and beautiful as tortured singer Dorothy,with Rossellini bringing sadness to the role. Dennis Hopper is brilliant and terrifying as Frank Booth,one of the greatest villains of all time. Hopper is so scary he makes you think that he is not playing Frank Booth,but he is Frank Booth. Laura Dern gives a wonderful performance as Sandy,Jeffrey's neighbor and love interest. Dean Stockwell is fantastic as Ben,a friend of Frank's. Brad Dourif(Raymond),Jack Nance(Paul),George Dickerson(Detective Williams),Hope Lange(Mrs. Williams),Priscilla Pointer(Mrs. Beaumont)and Frances Bay(Aunt Barbara)give good performances as well.The direction by David Lynch is brilliant,with Lynch bringing a beautiful and surreal visual style to the film and with Lynch always moving the camera giving the film a haunting,Film-Noir look to it. Great direction by Lynch.The score by Angelo Badalamenti is excellent and at times beautiful,suspenseful and mysterious. Masterful score from Badalamenti. There is also great songs from Bobby Vinton(Blue Velvet),Roy Orbison(In Dreams),Love Letters(Ketty Lester)and Mysteries Of Love(Julee Cruise). Amazing songs.In final word,if you David Lynch,Film-Noir,Mysteries or films in general,I highly suggest you see Blue Velvet,a beautiful,haunting and disturbing Masterpiece that will stay with you after you watch it.

I've never forgotten that quote and I remember hearing it live as the fifth Treehouse of Horror special aired. Whenever The Shining is brought up in my presence, or whenever I start a conversation about it, I quote those lines. And yes, with the Scottish accent for Willy and never calling the movie by any other name other than The Shinning.For those as nostalgic as me, it gathers a few laughs. Mostly from myself. But&#x85;I sincerely digress. I'm here to talk about The (real) Shining. And, sadly, I cannot accomplish this without spoilers. So, you are warned.** If You Have Not Seen The Shining, or even The Shinning, then just know this I highly recommend this movie. Watch it now. Don't wait, call out sick and get a copy. Watch it and then continue with my review. Press stop now. **Whew. I truly believe I could write a novel on how fantastic, how awesome, how truly incredible this masterpiece is. Maybe, one day I will, but for now, I will give you my basic, run-of-the-Thesar review.First, let me start off (again?) with how pleased I am that I bought this on BluRay. I had originally planned on it by setting aside April 2013 as the month to re-watch and finally review a bunch of older movies from my past and I included The Shining. You see, this was one of my first horror movies I ever saw as a kid. And I distinctly remember that I was disappointed because, and yeah, these are my words Only two people died. And, one of them was the killer!Moving right along, the last time I saw this, after several more viewings, was about 1994, I estimate. So we're talking 19 years since I last saw this and just about the same time that Simpsons episode aired. And back then, I was sadly, and unfortunately influenced by who I saw it with who said It's one of those movies (that's so boring) that if you fast-forwarded a bit, you'd be in the same place as you were when you initially hit 'fast-forward.' Due to my typical disdain for slow-moving pictures, I (now, regrettably) believed him.Fast-forward, once again, to 2013 and I heard about a documentary called Room 237. I wanted to watch that, but since it's been about 19 years since I've seen the original, why not purchase it on BluRay and revisit the classic. My eyes opened so wide during this viewing, I didn't know if they close.Any small infraction of my poor feelings about this movie was wiped clean. This is&#x85;a&#x85;near PERFECT MOVIE. Mood, cinematography, atmosphere, dialogue, suspense, score, acting, originality, fear&#x85;it's all here. Generally, I am weary of very long movies, especially long ones that take&#x85;it&#x85;slow. But, this movie never, ever, felt slow. Thanks to Director Kubrick, he moved the film along with rich dialogue, excellent scenes of the ever-so isolated Colorado hotel or score. He accomplished what Hitchcock set out to do and what M. Night Shyamalan could never touch.Now, there will be some, or possibly, many, who will compare it to the equally masterful book it's based on. I have read that incredible book, and loved every page of it and this movie, well, took themes, characters and settings, but overall, it was fairly far off target. The nice thing about judging a project on its own merit is that you can enjoy both and be honest about it. Not to mention, now you get two alternative universes to enjoy. Much like the original Star Trek legendary films and series and the updated J.J. Abrams vision. So, I like what direction Kubrick took with this story.I also love what Jack Nicolson did to the role of Jack Torrance. And both Shelley Duvall and Danny Lloyd were also very good, as was Scatman Crothers.Already off Jack takes a job as the caretaker of the gorgeous Colorado hotel for the off-season winter and brings his special son and wife in tow. Jack's excited because the job requires little maintenance and care, and he gets to finish the novel he quit his teaching job for. Only&#x85;the isolation\/cabin fever is starting to get Jackie boy a little, well, more tense.Little by little, Jack gets more stressed and agitated. More and more that special son of his has visions of past guests who met unfortunate ends there, to say the least. And Mom, well, she's growing further and further concerned.See? The overall tension builds as the minutes of the film passes for all parties involved. And as more is revealed around them, the very worse things get for the Torrance's.Hands down, one of the most memorable and scariest movie scenes of my whole life was when (now-GONE) Jack breaks into the bathroom to teach his wife a lesson, or final one, at least. I don't recall now, but I believe I couldn't get that image of the axe through the door, or Wendy Torrance striking back, out of my head and possibly dreams for many years. It's still enormously effective today.I literally could dissect almost every chapter on the disc and fill up volumes of my own chapters. This should be taught in film school. Each scene, each set, each line, each facial expression or, lack thereof, were all so masterfully crafted, it's good that it appears slow (even when it's not) so we can sit back, absorb and understand how a real film should be made.Would I recommend this? Well, you don't need the shinning to figure out if I did.

You've got the Shinning, says Groundskeeper Willy.You mean 'Shining,' replies Bart Simpson.Shh! You want to get sued? answers Groundskeeper Willy.That was 1994. The Simpsons came out with their fifth of twenty-third Treehouse of Horror specials. The year, now, is 2013. To this day. I've never forgotten that quote and I remember hearing it live as the fifth Treehouse of Horror special aired. Whenever The Shining is brought up in my presence, or whenever I start a conversation about it, I quote those lines. And yes, with the Scottish accent for Willy and never calling the movie by any other name other than The Shinning.For those as nostalgic as me, it gathers a few laughs. Mostly from myself. But&#x85;I sincerely digress. I'm here to talk about The (real) Shining. And, sadly, I cannot accomplish this without spoilers. So, you are warned.** If You Have Not Seen The Shining, or even The Shinning, then just know this I highly recommend this movie. Watch it now. Don't wait, call out sick and get a copy. Watch it and then continue with my review. Press stop now. **Whew. I truly believe I could write a novel on how fantastic, how awesome, how truly incredible this masterpiece is. Maybe, one day I will, but for now, I will give you my basic, run-of-the-Thesar review.First, let me start off (again?) with how pleased I am that I bought this on BluRay. I had originally planned on it by setting aside April 2013 as the month to re-watch and finally review a bunch of older movies from my past and I included The Shining. You see, this was one of my first horror movies I ever saw as a kid. And I distinctly remember that I was disappointed because, and yeah, these are my words Only two people died. And, one of them was the killer!Moving right along, the last time I saw this, after several more viewings, was about 1994, I estimate. So we're talking 19 years since I last saw this and just about the same time that Simpsons episode aired. And back then, I was sadly, and unfortunately influenced by who I saw it with who said It's one of those movies (that's so boring) that if you fast-forwarded a bit, you'd be in the same place as you were when you initially hit 'fast-forward.' Due to my typical disdain for slow-moving pictures, I (now, regrettably) believed him.Fast-forward, once again, to 2013 and I heard about a documentary called Room 237. I wanted to watch that, but since it's been about 19 years since I've seen the original, why not purchase it on BluRay and revisit the classic. My eyes opened so wide during this viewing, I didn't know if they close.Any small infraction of my poor feelings about this movie was wiped clean. This is&#x85;a&#x85;near PERFECT MOVIE. Mood, cinematography, atmosphere, dialogue, suspense, score, acting, originality, fear&#x85;it's all here. Generally, I am weary of very long movies, especially long ones that take&#x85;it&#x85;slow. But, this movie never, ever, felt slow. Thanks to Director Kubrick, he moved the film along with rich dialogue, excellent scenes of the ever-so isolated Colorado hotel or score. He accomplished what Hitchcock set out to do and what M. Night Shyamalan could never touch.Now, there will be some, or possibly, many, who will compare it to the equally masterful book it's based on. I have read that incredible book, and loved every page of it and this movie, well, took themes, characters and settings, but overall, it was fairly far off target. The nice thing about judging a project on its own merit is that you can enjoy both and be honest about it. Not to mention, now you get two alternative universes to enjoy. Much like the original Star Trek legendary films and series and the updated J.J. Abrams vision. So, I like what direction Kubrick took with this story.I also love what Jack Nicolson did to the role of Jack Torrance. And both Shelley Duvall and Danny Lloyd were also very good, as was Scatman Crothers.Already off Jack takes a job as the caretaker of the gorgeous Colorado hotel for the off-season winter and brings his special son and wife in tow. Jack's excited because the job requires little maintenance and care, and he gets to finish the novel he quit his teaching job for. Only&#x85;the isolation\/cabin fever is starting to get Jackie boy a little, well, more tense.Little by little, Jack gets more stressed and agitated. More and more that special son of his has visions of past guests who met unfortunate ends there, to say the least. And Mom, well, she's growing further and further concerned.See? The overall tension builds as the minutes of the film passes for all parties involved. And as more is revealed around them, the very worse things get for the Torrance's.Hands down, one of the most memorable and scariest movie scenes of my whole life was when (now-GONE) Jack breaks into the bathroom to teach his wife a lesson, or final one, at least.

My English teacher taught him more as a mopey Dane, but he plays him as a cunning but indecisive genius which I believe is more interesting. His soliloquies have great touch to them, using visual elements and artful expression to make them interesting instead if Rambling. The cast is great too.

The Cinematography shows off the world well and fits most scenes, same with the music.The problem is the length. It drags in places and with trimming could've been a masterful movie.

Mostly grin because it is a respectable effort at a production, but I can't help but believe that the entire tale was never meant to see the screen via Bakshi. I remember opening weekend for this thing. The theatres were packed. Sold out. Or, more correctly, overbooked. Thousands thronged the theatre. Lines ran out into the streets. You couldn't get a seat for the life of you.And then the film ran. And people walked out wondering what it was they had just seen. You hear critics give their opinion, but you don't hear fans voicing their amazement at the visuals, but also feeling like they were sold a bill of goods.The artistry that went into this production is half good, half b-grade material. I think this project was given to Bakshi because he knew that the full tale would not be realized by old guard Hollywood who were paranoid of a culture that harkened back to mythology and days of yore.At the time I saw the film I had a hard time following it, even with the added narrative supplied by the characters. One moment were in location A, then the next we're in location B with some new characters. Next we're in location C confronting some event, and so on and so forth. In short, the Tolkien tale that people wanted never had a chance to materialize. It would take thirty years and an Aussie with some filmmaking know how, a track record, and a vision to propose the project and make all of Tolkien's ring saga come to life. In the meantime Tolkien fans had this half hearted effort that had some interesting visuals on one level, but lacked a lot of care on another level. Again, it was done intentionally.Then again Bakshi's films tend to have an unfinished quality to them. If you look at American Pop, Heavy Traffic, or Cool World, or Wizards, you'll note that the production tends to fall apart somewhat at the end. Cool World feels very rushed at the end, American Pop actually keeps nearly all of its gloss but suffers the same here and there. So it is that we don't just get rotoscoped animation, but full on tinted footage of stuntmen or actors doing things that should have been rendered by hand.The character design is also hit and miss. The hobbits are well done, the wizards are likewise keenly crafted, but the one dwarf in the film looks like a miner from 1849 California, and not a dwarf at all, while the elves tend to have feline eyes for some reason. The backgrounds are interesting, however. Taking a page out of Avante-Garde 1960s and early 1970s, the sets for this piece are more abstract at times, and it seems to work well from time to time with the piece that's being presented. Other times it feels like a budget saver.What to say about it in the end? All in all the film is a rushed effort, and in my opinion never had a chance from the start. My opinion is that there was probably a fear that Tolkien's tales of white heros might have been seen as socially destabilizing for a country that was just coming out of some very hefty social upheavals regarding race, politics and social status; and this falls in line with Tolkien because orcs, men, dwarfs and elves were all different races, although the orcs are the ones who are cast as the heavies. I have no direct proof of that, but one wonders how Disney Studios might have handled a similar project; which, by the way, is right up their alley (minus some of the more graphic violence).See it once.

Michael Cane can usually elevate a role, and Sally Field was at the peak of her spunky period. There was an interesting pairing of Mark Harmon near the beginning of his career with Agnela Cartwright (Lost in Space) near the end of hers.So, an interesting distraction for people of a certain age, but don't go out of your way to see it. ","genre":"Action, Adventure"},{"date":"9 April 2013","score":"3 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" Those too young to remember the 70s probably can't appreciate the significance of the disaster movie genre to moviegoers of that decade. The canon of this genre included Airport, Earthquake, The Towering Inferno, and of course the original Poseidon Adventure. These wowed audiences with big budgets and state of the (pre-CGI) art special effects, but at heart, the central disaster and exacerbating obstacles were really just a vehicle to drive the interaction of the all-star casts, resulting in pithy dialog, personal revelations, budding romance, and noble sacrifice. Because of the epic, apocalyptic nature of these movies, there was generally a solid sense of closure and finality at the end. This made sequels an even more dubious concept than usual for movies. There were two progressively worse sequels to Airport, and this movie follows a similar pattern. It's characterized by a lower budget, lesser stars, and a much more contrived plot than the venerable original.The contrast between the two movies is stark from the beginning. Whereas the first opens in the grand ballroom of a luxury cruise ships, this opens with Michael Cane piloting his teeny tugboat across the Atlantic through a the same storm that is capsizing the Poseidon not far away. I laughed out loud when the waves broke over the deck, clearly thrown from buckets just off camera. The storm causes him to lose his cargo, which consists of three crates lashed just behind the wheel house. Desperate for money, he stumbles onto the capsized Poseidon and decides to loot it under the international laws of salvage. Luckily for him, after rescuing the surviving cast of the original movie, everyone else left, without making any attempt to recover anything from the ship or locate additional survivors. Simultaneously, another, nicer boat arrives, carrying Telly Sevalas and his sinister looking, white-clad crew. He claims to be be a doctor looking for survivors. If it's a spoiler to tell you he's lying, then you've never watched *any* movies.They all enter the boat and, yada yada yada, survivors, setbacks, revelation, romance, betrayal, sacrifice, pretty much everything on the checklist. Disaster movies are never particularly believable, but this one doesn't even try.

Goldblum, fantastic here, plays an out there scientist, Seth Brundle, who lives in a loft downtown, has thirty of the same set of suits that could do with a good clean, two baboons, his own real cappuccino expresso with the eagle on top, and to top that off, these two intriguing telepods, fridge like contraptions, or the new mode in tall washing dryers, that take up the centre of his dark moody pad. He runs experiments in them, transporting items, etc, from one telepod to another with not always successful results. Here to witness his experiments is a reporter, Ronnie-Geena (Ms soon to be Mrs Goldblum) Davis who becomes his love interest. One night, when Ronnie leaves Seth for a few hours, to officially end it with her ex and arrogant boss (John Getz, the character actor, again great as he's been in other films) Seth, orders home delivery Chinese, gets drunk, and makes a fatal mistake. He goes inside the telepod, only a fly gets in there with him. From here, we like Ronnie, notice changes in Seth, not just physical, as he horribly undergoes the slow and ugly disintegration of a man, as if a fly. Not only that, Ronnie has got pregnant, where Seth and her did it that night, after he made the transformation, where Ronnie now knowing the full story of Seth's fate, must decide whether to keep the newborn which leads to the culmination of our tale, amidst some nice bloody bits of violence that run at occasional tides throughout this lovable horror flick. Goldblum I must say, with his long hairdo, that's unlike Goldblum, really impresses, in still one of his best performances while he has great support. He really has his moments too. It's poster design plus title, really stands out too. Special effects are fantastic. Horror flicks like this, made the eighties what they truly were.

Sadly, as of the time of this writing, it's considered the worst Trek movie of the series, and for some viewers, it might even be ranked as one of the worst movies of all time.Even I won't deny that the film has its issues. The special effects are strangely gaudy in this film, lacking in refinement or quality. The acting is at its cheesiest, with jokes and anecdotes thrown out profusely throughout the picture. Most viewers will also take issue with Sybok's character - you'll find out why about halfway through the picture - and the overall plot, which comes off as messy and directionless.The film is not without charm, however. I personally always enjoyed the comedic antics of the three main characters, especially during the opening mountain climbing scenes and during their madcap pursuits in the Enterprise's interior. Action is frequent and will be pleasing for non-discerning Trek fans.As ambitious as the story is, it runs through a rather formulaic plot, with little room for quality character development. Themes should be present, but generally aren't. It's as straightforward and simple as a Trek movie can be.This film is captured with okay, never great, photography and editing.

The romance in the film just ends up being a little meandering just due to me not being a fan of that genre to the characters transforming to pretty clichéd ones st these times. There are strong performances not really from the lead, Heath Ledger but from the supporting actors of Paul Bettany and a minor role yet extremely enjoyable one played by James Purefoy. Emotionally, it involves you and you sentimentally care. Tge entire film is pretty limited in it's enviorment\/setting but you'll forget it due to so many funny and original scenarios always occurring. The score of the film keeps it alive as well because of the soundtrack not being filled with such dramatic music but more hip and giddy songs that actually portray the scenes quite well, they fit perfectly. Overall, this is a well rounded film of an underdog story with a romance that deserves to be given a chance of your viewing.

YTMB is all about liberating yourself and finally realizing that sex after all is not such a big thing.The way director has focused on the psychology of characters makes us love them even more. We shun our moral judgement for a while and think whether what we normally believe about life is true or not. In the start boys keep on fighting because they had 'made' each other's girl-friends but later in the movie they forget it and laugh about it. Also, Lucia keeps on feeling sad because her husband has cheated on her but in the end shuns everything and forgives her husband or at least tries to. Lucia help the boys realize that we have take things in our stride and the boys teach her the same thing.I like the movies which affect the core of human heart, and question our beliefs and what is wrong or right, in short help in maturing the mindset of people. Though not everyone would like what is shown in movie but it surely is another perspective to remember that it's we who impose conditions on ourselves and in some circumstance we might also go against the normal and feel absolutely OK about it.

For a good number of years now this film has routinely been included at the top or just off the top of best films of all time lists. Yet, unlike most others with that type of prestige, this film did not do well at the box office on initial release; it did get nominated for several Oscars but didn't actually win any. It was only once it was released on home video that its reputation began to grow and grow. Nowadays it's almost taken for granted that Shawshank is one of those films that many people consider their all time favourite. For me personally, I can't truly understand the magnitude of love that Shawshank engenders. I think it is certainly a great film though.It's based on a Stephen King novella called 'Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption'. It's a prison drama and the story itself is quite straightforward. It's essentially about an innocent man incarcerated within a corrupt legal system. It has some well observed things to say about men being institutionalised and the direction is expertly handled &#x96; it takes it's time, keeps things simple but is never less than compelling. But what really makes this film work is the characterisations and the excellent script. There are two great central performances from Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman. They have a real chemistry together and you really believe in their friendship. In fact, it's friendship that Shawshank is effectively about. I think it's this factor more than any other that has helped it make such a wide connection with people.
