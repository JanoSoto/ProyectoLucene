[{"date":"15 April 2007","score":"","review":" I was flicking through the TV channels late at night and I came across the film. It is not the type of film I usually watch but after 10 minutes, I was hooked and I stayed like that till the very end.The first part of the film is about Captain John Boyd played by Guy Pearce who has been sent to a broken down army fort in Sierra Nevada in the 1800s. The reason is his act of cowardice in the Mexican-American war of 1847. The fort is manned by a small gang of soldiers and officers who are the dregs of the army and have all been tucked away as if they are an embarrassment for the army. These are Col. Hart (Jeffrey Jones), Pvt. Cleaves (David Arquette), Knox (Stephen Spinella), Pvt Reich (Neal McDonough), Pvt. Toffler (Jeremy Davies) and two Indian siblings George (Joseph Runningfox) and Martha (Sheila Tousey).They are soon confronted by the horror from the outside world when Robert Carlyle (Ives\/Colqhoun) turns up, frozen and sick. The film moves from an ordinary movie about the soldiers having to deal with the harshness of life on a run down fort in the middle of winter and into something entirely different. A story about murder and cannibalism. Carlyle, when he first shows up acts like the victim and says that there might be a survivor and the soldiers have no choice but to go and look for themselves but they are too late and as a result they are killed by Ives accept Boyd who in desperation has to eat Pvt. Reich to get back to the fort.The next part of the film is Boyd trying to make Martha, Pvt. Cleaves, Knox and Gen. Slauson (John Spencer) to believe his wild story to them but to us, we are in the same situation as Boyd because we have seen what Ives has done and we know he is the madman not Boyd but Ives is clever and never is suspected of any wrong doing. The irony is everyone thinks Boyd is mad and won't listen to him and we see Boyd having to deal with everyone's suspicion that he has something to do with the murders of the soldiers and we also see his fight within himself, to resist the temptation of eating human flesh again.At the end, Boyd decides to kill Ives to stop the madness and in the end knows the only way he is going to do that is to kill himself as well which we see when he is trying to find Ives and comes across a trap device. Boyd certainly thinks the murder and cannibalism will be stopped if they are both dead and no-one else is infected with the hunger for human flesh but we see at the end, Ives has left a pot on and Gen. Slauson tries it and then keeps on trying it and the audience is left to wonder if he will turn into the type of addicted person who won't be able to stop eating human flesh and will hunger for it like Ives and Boyd.The film is brilliant. It has many twists and turns which you don't see till they are upon you. The actors make the film compelling especially Guy Pearce and Robert Carlyle. Pearce gives Boyd intensity and vulnerability. Carlyle shows Ives as a man who doesn't think he is doing anything wrong and blinded by the benefits of his physical health from eating human flesh but who doesn't see himself as a madman, just someone who is trying to survive.Special mention should go to Antonia Bird who kept me permanently on the edge of my seat. Damon Alburn and Michael Nyman whose music worked well with the visual images to add to the tension. The Cinnematography by Anthony B. Richmond and Film Editing by Neil Farrell that adds to suspense of the film.

Also, the dialog written for John Merrick (the Elephant Man) seems designed to make everyone burst into tears. It did move me, indeed, but it just seemed perhaps a little too planned.Because this film was made in 1980, the make-up, as brilliant as it was, seems like make-up. Poor John Hurt was forced to walk around with this huge bubble head which makes him look distinctly like The Alien's spawn. If the lighting hit it a certain way, it had a sort of almost Halloween-mask feeling about it, sort of plastic and fake. I hate to say that, because obviously the make-up artist did a superb job, and they based the shape on the bone structure of the poor individual who suffered these ghastly diseases.Anthony Hopkins, as always, is brilliant. He really can do no wrong. John Hurt, I thought, was superb. He should have won an Oscar for having to live inside that head, plus walk as if his spine was deformed. He must have been in agony for the entire film.David Lynch was unquestionably the best choice for this film and I think he's utterly brilliant. But I did think some of the lighting was a bit too bright in some scenes; I felt the sick and tragic mad crowd party crashing scene went on a hair too long and the music seemed just a tad too calculated, and the ending, when we are suddenly thrust into the starry galaxy was so reminiscent of The Twilight Zone that that is exactly what I blurted out to my friend as we watched it.And yet... the story pulls you in and keeps you with it, and you cannot help but feel absolute pity for this poor soul, and when he says, I'm not an animal!

Bold doesn't quite equal great, however.Humanities professor Humbert Humbert (James Mason) takes up lodging in the New Hampshire household of Charlotte (Shelley Winters) and daughter Delores Lolita Haze (Sue Lyon). Humbert takes a decidedly unhealthy interest in teenaged Lolita, and encourages a romance with Charlotte in order to bring the girl into his unfatherly bosom. As his relationship with Lolita proceeds, he sweats more and more society's prying eyes.The problem with Lolita as I see it is that Kubrick was never good with people. The characters in Lolita never come across as real, whether its Winters' over-the-top performance as Mom or Peter Sellers as the mysterious Clare Quilty, more a director's affectation than a real character as he keeps popping up at all the wrong times to play on Humbert's growing paranoia. Sellers is even doing Kubrick's voice, and seems to be a case of the director inserting himself into the film. Why else does Quilty keep reappearing?Kubrick made other films with broad caricatures that work fine, like Clockwork Orange and The Shining. The problem with Lolita is it's a story that lives or dies on your acceptance of the players as real people, especially as it centers on a young girl's ruined innocence and a man's believable, willing descent into the role of victimizer and, eventually, victim. As a viewer, you need sympathy to make the experience of watching Lolita work, to make it as unnerving as author Vladimir Nabokov intended.The film starts off promisingly, hitting us with its gauzy early-60s flip take on suburbia, with the cha-cha-cha, summer balls, and Sue Lyon's fabulously knowing take on Lolita pre-seduction. Kubrick's black-and-white compositions are on par with his later Dr. Strangelove, not to mention Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho. Mason has fun as the man with the secret, communicating his passion to the audience while wearing the mask for Ma. Kubrick may not have been able to show Humbert and Lo engaged in more than a kiss on the cheek, but this forced restraint only adds to the film's cleverness, finding subverted sexuality in such things as eating a fried egg.Lolita starts going wrong with the character of Charlotte, played by Winters as a petulant woman-child stifled by a retarded religiosity. Her character's story arc is the stuff of tragedy, but played for a cheap laugh. When she discovers Humbert's designs for her daughter, she is angry, of course, yet more at the daughter than Humbert, calling her miserable brat and little beast.As the film develops, we come to share Charlotte's attitude toward Lolita. It is Lolita who starts the seduction, and Lolita who plays Humbert throughout, manipulating him with a casual cruelty that seems to justify his every perverted excess. I'm really sorry that I cheated so much, she says at one point. It's just the way things are. The only hint of collateral damage is the film's last image, a portrait of a young girl with a gunshot burn on her cheek.That's not quite giving away how the film turns out; that's one of the film's first images as well. Kubrick's usual devices (narrator's voice, circular plot design) are out in force and a comfort to his many fans for sure, but they don't add to the experience for those of us outside the club. How did they make a movie of 'Lolita'? was the film's famous tagline, but Kubrick seemed at a loss as to why, and it shows.

And, yet, if only for its sheer rarity among American movies, it IS worth a viewing now and then. The Depression dance marathon setting can be viewed in a strictly historical context, but I gather the screenwriters, James Poe and Robert E. Thompson, and director Sydney Pollack were shooting at a bigger metaphor here -- Life is a marathon, it's all rigged anyway, and no one gets out alive. (I'm not familiar with Horace McCoy's source novel, sorry.)Since watching people dance themselves into exhaustion tends to lose its interest after a half-hour or so, it's the characters who really carry this movie. The soul of TSHDT is Gig Young, the dance promoter\/emcee who plays -- or is -- God. His Best Supporting Actor Oscar may have been a disappointment to him in later years as his career declined, but here he is truly superb in the role -- largely hateful but surprisingly sympathetic at times. Red Buttons deservedly received a Golden Globe nomination for his nicely restrained performance, and Susannah York (who lrooks mahvuhlous!) also got Oscar and Golden Globe noms, as well as a BAFTA Supporting Actress award for her performance (which she later said she didn't care for). Bruce Dern and Bonnie Bedelia are a bit bland as a country couple hoping to win big bucks on the dance floor, but Al Lewis, Michael Conrad, Allyn Anne McLerie, and most of the other actors do succeed is making us care about these characters and their predicament.Unfortunately, the character of Robert is not well defined, and Michael Sarrazin plays him as though in a daze much of the time. Jane Fonda's character also disappoints. This was her first post-Barbarella part, and she's struggling to present herself here both as a serious actress and as a political\/social commentator. The acting chops were undoubtedly there (she got an Oscar nom for this role and won two years later for Klute), but her Gloria is so bitchy and sullen that it's difficult to believe that Robert is going to work up the sympathy for her that leads to the film's climax. A few additional glimmers of humanity in Gloria might have made this film the true tragedy that its creators were aiming for.TSHDT is set in 1932, one of the worst years in America's past, and the film was no doubt green-lighted and filmed in the aftermath of another horrific year, 1968, when Martin Luther King and Robert Kennedy were assassinated, race riots broke out across the country, and the Tet offensive snuffed the light in the end of the Vietnam tunnel. Perhaps the filmmakers believed that young moviegoers would be receptive to the unrelenting grimness of this film. But most Americans -- no matter how poor or powerless, in 1932, 1968, or 2007 -- have little appreciation of what true desperation and hopelessness are. The U.S. economic dislocation of the 1930s was hardly in the same global ballpark as plague, famine, tyranny and genocide; and as bad as 1968 may have appeared on TV, most Americans came through it largely unscathed. There is something far too affected and world-weary about the pessimism of TSHDT, and it's amusing to think of all the 1970 college students (including me) emerging from their local twin theaters after seeing TSHDT, shaking their heads and crying, Boy, life really is a bitch! before getting into the cars that their Mommies and Daddies provided and heading out in search of something to get high on.

My friend pointed out that Gleason's timing - the manner in which he held his slow-burn, the widening of his eyes, the sudden Bang! Zoom take off into the line - was what always made it funny. We weren't laughing at the line so much at the performance of it.Don't Be A Menace is the most obvious collection of predictable gags and bits I have seen in a long time, but it is by far the funniest. The Wayans are rather stuck - the genres they parody here have very rigid conventions, so much so that there is usually only one or two gags one can use to mock them - e.g., when a young gangsta warns us that many young men in the 'hood don't live to see their 21st birthday, we all know what's coming next. So the Wayans handle it in a manner that delays the punchline while emphasizing its obviousness. Thus we laugh with them, appreciating the way they pull it off, and recognizing the gangsta genre limit that's getting parodied, rather than at the bit itself.Just about the whole movie operates on this level, and for this reason has become one of my favorite comedies. The Wayans capture every moment with a dead-on rhythm that blends the gags into a kind of music. Shawn plays the steady bass while Marlon does some wild riffing. Other characters and bits drop in and out like improvisation and sound effects. Keenan Wayans drops in every now and then like the voice on a scratch dub. The tempo could have been a little swifter, but the rhythm itself is excellent.Comedy like this is very tricky, and I personally didn't think the Wayans' efforts in the Scary Movie films were quite as successful - but here they move it right along.It's rude, it's crude, it's in-yor-face - and it's just a delight to watch.

My friend pointed out that Gleason's timing - the manner in which he held his slow-burn, the widening of his eyes, the sudden Bang! Zoom take off into the line - was what always made it funny. We weren't laughing at the line so much at the performance of it.Don't Be A Menace is the most obvious collection of predictable gags and bits I have seen in a long time, but it is by far the funniest. The Wayans are rather stuck - the genres they parody here have very rigid conventions, so much so that there is usually only one or two gags one can use to mock them - e.g., when a young gangsta warns us that many young men in the 'hood don't live to see their 21st birthday, we all know what's coming next.

Admittedly made about the last non-controversial war in which the United States was involved, Zanuck's film downplays the brutal realism of more recent war movies and focuses on the broad vistas of thousands of soldiers storming the Normandy Beaches on June 6, 1944. Employing dozens of well-known actors in small parts, The Longest Day effectively utilizes the cameo approach to help viewers keep track of characters in the complex cutting between scenes that depict American, British, and German military personnel both on and off the battlefield. While a cast of unknowns would have enhanced the otherwise documentary-style approach, the audience would have been lost as to who was who. Among the large cast, John Wayne and Robert Mitchum, no strangers to war film heroics, register strongest, although Richard Burton, Sean Connery, Edmund O'Brien, Jeffrey Hunter, and Richard Beymer are also memorable. The bevy of rock and roll stars that includes Fabian and Paul Anka will be unrecognizable to younger viewers and illustrates the dangers of casting those with fleeting fame in a movie intended to be seen over the decades. Only one actress, Irina Demick, appears among the otherwise entirely male cast. Her credibility, however, as a French resistance fighter is severely undercut by her carefully applied makeup and perfectly coiffed hair.The stunning black and white cinematography creates bold and beautiful images of the battle, which was filmed on the beaches where it took place. One incredible uncut helicopter shot follows a platoon down the streets of a French town, around the harbor, and into an encounter with another platoon on the other side of the town. The logistics of setting up the shot must have been awesome in the days before CGI. Although three directors were used, evidently producer Zanuck was the guiding force, and the result is a seamless film with few blunders. Unfortunately, the screenplay at times relies on expository dialog to identify characters or to set up a scene, and occasionally an obvious attempt at meaning creeps into such lines as I wonder who won? The stirring march penned by Paul Anka may be too up-tempo and enthusiastic to underscore the depiction of a day when thousands died, but the music does emphasize the producer's intent to celebrate a great victory. However, the addition of insipid lyrics over the closing credits goes too far in trivializing a weighty subject. Nevertheless, The Longest Day remains a fine tribute to the men who fought on D-Day and does a credible job of remaining faithful to the facts without embellishing them with the kind of fanciful fiction that marred another filmed depiction of the battle.

That time was not so long ago either. Many of us remember it fondly from our youth. In fact, it's epicenter may well have been the Summer of '69 when we witnessed the greatest technological feat mankind has ever accomplished. Even though there was a controversial war going on, it seemed all humankind came together and rooted for three United States astronauts who were hundreds of thousands of miles away attempting history's first lunar landing! I can not overstate this, in my life I've never seen the world community so together on any other issue or thing. This was simply a galvanizing moment for all humanity.The Dish captures this time wonderfully. From the start, when we are introduced to a senior version of Sam Neil's character set against the Parkes beautiful countryside, this movie gives you that warm-fuzzy feeling. The story is excellent, even better because all the main ingredients were true. Though the story doesn't possess the life-or-death urgency of Apollo 13, it does tell an important story I, myself, was not aware of...And, it's even got a little tension.Details in the movie, for me at any rate, added to the joy of watching it. For instance...The great soundtrack had a gem that is just under the radar for the period, that being Something In The Air by Thunderclap Newman. Great song and tailor made for the topic! The cinematography was so Technicolor-Like and immediate I wanted to walk into almost every scene. The time, the story and the characters were so hand-in-glove perfectly portrayed in this movie, I just know if I could walk into this wonderful Australian township, with it's equally wonderful citizens, I would love it. Could it be this great in reality, probably not, but it's a movie about a time past and it's a complete success as far as that goes. If you enjoy a good life-affirming story don't miss The Dish.
