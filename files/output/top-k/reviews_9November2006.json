Not necessarily because either one puts forth its message of intolerance-is-rotten more significantly (although I'd wager Crash throws the hammer down much more thickly in comparison with this), but because of how the storytelling and contrivances never get much in the way like with Crash. Maybe it's not really necessary to compare the two, as Crossfire is in its core all deep into the film-noir vein like its going out of style. It was interesting actually to see what the director Edward Dmytryk said on the DVD interview, where he mentioned that the budget for the photography was significantly lower (on purpose) so that more could be spent on the actors, and the schedule went through at a very brisk, quick pace. But then what comes off then as being incredible about the picture is that you would think looking at many of the lighting set-ups that it took a lot to do. Just for a small scene, like when Robert Mitchum's Keeely first goes in for questioning under the Captain Robert Young- the contrasts of shadows seamlessly in the room is exquisite. That there are many other lighting set-ups that go even further with so little marks this as something essential in the realm of just the look of the noir period. Just take a look at a shot of characters on a stairwell, the bars silhouetted against them, and see what I mean.But back to the substance part of the film- it's really a story that consists of a murder mystery, but one that we as the audience don't take long to figure on the answer. It's then more about something else then in the mind and soul of a killer that wouldn't be found in a common crime picture then, as there are really no 'criminals' for the most part in the film. There's a very calculated risk with this then that characters could be too thin just to prop up the (worthwhile) message against anti-semitism. But Dmytryk's direction of his top-shelf cast, along with a really terrific script by John Paxton fleshes out the characters, least of which for what they should have to not seem too thin alongside the message. And what would a noir be then without some attitude to go along with it? Mitchum helps that along, even in scenes like between him and Young where its very much based in the situation of the story's moment (i.e. a detail in the plot), by injecting a little sly wit into some of the dialog. It may already be there in the lines, but he helps make the character with a good edge for his scenes.Then there's also Robert Ryan, who excels at Montgomery as a man who you know you don't like much at first, just through his b.s. demeanor, but you're not totally sure about either. Then once it starts to come clearer- ironically through a subjective view-point of the suspect Mitchell (George Cooper) at the apartment of the soon-to-be-deceased Samuels- his performance becomes a great balancing act of being full of crap and also rather frightening in his blind-way. It's a good performance when also countered with Cooper, who has actual personal issues that he faces and comes forward with regret and humility. It's really after the film ends that one thinks about a lot of this, however, and while you're watching the film it's more about getting into the dialog and the flow of the scenes, and in the sometimes stark, overpowering camera moves on the actors, so the message is in a way secondary. Not that it isn't an important one, especially for the time period (coming right off of WW2), but years later its seeing the actors, even the ones that don't get the big marquee status like Gloria Grahame as Ginny (the femme fatale of the picture, if it could've had time for one which it doesn't) and William Phipps as Leroy (the hick), working off one another that sticks much strongly in the compacted screenplay.Dmytryk is also very wise in choosing to limit the musical score is powerful too, as for very long stretches we hear nothing, and mostly when it does come up it's incidental to the character's surroundings. He could've just as easily gone with added musical notes on some dramatic scenes for emphasis, most specifically the opening audience-grabber into the film. By sticking clear of that, and getting the right attitudes and nuance in camera and cast, it uplifts standards in genre material to a very fine, memorable level. My favorite scene would probably go to Finley's story about an Irish immigrant he tells to Leroy, where all such elements come into place well. It might not come in very high at the top of my favorite noirs- and I'd still throw-down Murder My Sweet as the director's masterpiece in this kind of picture- but it's assuredly higher in quality than something of the B-level too.

She knew the power of her seductive behavior in the guise of friendship with this poor slob, Trent, and what she could do with it. She also knew how predictable her parents were and set them up constantly.

The parents are like the Bushes or Kennedys, externally real but internally vacant. Even when they are present, nobody is home.

Realistically violent. That is not good for a movie. There are violent films. Then there are violent films that are unpleasant to watch. Don't get me wrong. This is a great film. But, lets face facts, you can't watch this movie more than once. It got to the point where I stood up in tears yelling at the screen STOP IT, STOP IT!

The girls are full of high spirits despite being in the position they are in. And there's that lovable pooch Sandy. Annie's closest companion. I liked the scene where some boys bother the dog, and Annie is not to be messed with. I liked the part where one boy pushed her, and Annie gives him a mean right, then she says, All right, who's next? The taller one gets pummeled into the trash can which I think is hilarious. I know the boys should known better than to mess with Sandy and Annie. Then when Annie gets to be in a mansion, she knows she won't have a problem fitting in. Knowing that her parents will get her, unknowing that they have perished in a fire. Annie is later suckered by Miss Hannigan(Carol Burnett) and her brother Rooster(Tim Curry) and Lily(Bernadette Peters). If Miss Hannigan went along with the plan, she'd be in hot water herself. I didn't blame her for clocking Rooster. All the stars made the movie magic come true, and it's very heart warming as well. This is a definite for Broadway buffs.

From Russia With Love stands as the James Bond series at its finest, still among the strongest of all Bond films, and a much closer realization for what would become the Bond Style than Dr. No (although the true prototype for a Bond film, Goldfinger was still one film away). Action, romance, sly comedic moments, suspense, From Russia With Love has it all.As the film unfolds, the British Secret Service has been contacted by a Russian cipher clerk, Tatiana Romanova (Daniela Bianchi), with an offer that she is willing to defect to the West and provide them with a Lektor decoding machine, which will allow the British to decode secret Russian transmissions, if they meet one criteria the individual who comes to Istanbul to collect her and the decoder must be James Bond (Sean Connery). Immediately, Bond and his superior, M (Bernard Lee), suspect a trap, and it is indeed one, with the orchestrator being the worldwide criminal organization SPECTRE. Two SPECTRE agents, Colonel Klebb (Lotte Lenya) and Kronsteen (Vladek Sheybal), assisted by SPECTRE henchmen Red Grant (Robert Shaw,) have created a plan to allow Bond and Tatiana to escape with the decoder, but eventually deliver it to SPECTRE and not the British. However, Bond and his Istanbul associate, Kerim Bay (Pedro Armendariz), have some plans of their own, and are determined to allow the decoder to make it all the way back to England.From Russia With Love was one of Ian Fleming's more popular Bond novels, reportedly a favorite of President Kennedy, so it is somewhat unsurprising that it was translated into one of the better loved Bond films. The film has a plot that would not be considered especially complicated, but it isn't the most straightforward of stories either, involving a lot of false moves and surprises around the corner. It also puts the audience in the driver's position to some degree, showing us almost every move the film makes and giving us the enjoyment of seeing Bond make his way through it and deduce all the villains actions throughout the film. From Russia With Love was close to end of the era where Fleming's novels were adapted somewhat closely, and From Russia With Love holds up as a reasonably involved story.However, as any modern viewer of a James Bond film knows, a good Bond film is all about three things the action set-pieces, the villain and the girl. From Russia With Love has some memorable moments throughout, including a fight at a gypsy camp where Bond and Bay hide out and a long involved sequence on a train as Bond and Tatiana attempt to escape Istanbul with SPECTRE agent Grant on their tail. Bond hadn't quite pushed to the edge of higher-octane action, but the mix of old fashioned fisticuffs and chases work well, making From Russia With Love a film that has its outrageous sides at times but still with most of its feet planted on the ground.From Russia With Love was the first Bond film to introduce what would become a series staple, and that was the ruthless, murderous henchman. Here it is Red Grant, played well by Robert Shaw, with the appropriate degree of both malice and sophistication when necessary. He is a ruthless individual and a worthy adversary for Bond. Daniela Bianchi is a good female foil for Bond, although her character is a bit on the silly side at times, and many modern viewers will probably find her someone anachronistic compared to modern female characters. She is a bit too flighty at moments, but still pulls off the role well.Connery is once again in top form as Bond, and here he shows off his portrayal of the character's almost unbreakable cool demeanor, such as when he seems to leisurely walk through a shootout in the gypsy camp sequence while all hell breaks loose. Bond's character is much more the suave persona that will become a staple, but is still able to show his tough side when necessary. Another very memorable element of From Russia With Love is Pedro Armendariz as Kerim Bay. He was the first of Bond's colorful associates and is still among the best. He makes Kerim Bay a light, enjoyable character who exudes charm and warmth on the screen during all his scenes.From Russia With Love still stands as Bond at the top of his game, and represents the series at the beginning of its creative peak.

Another very memorable element of From Russia With Love is Pedro Armendariz as Kerim Bay. He was the first of Bond's colorful associates and is still among the best.

","genre":"Action, Adventure, Thriller"},{"date":"9 November 2006","score":"","review":" Only one year after Dr. No brought James Bond to the silver screen, producers Albert Broccoli and Harry Saltzman unleashed its follow-up, From Russia With Love. From Russia With Love stands as the James Bond series at its finest, still among the strongest of all Bond films, and a much closer realization for what would become the Bond Style than Dr. No (although the true prototype for a Bond film, Goldfinger was still one film away). Action, romance, sly comedic moments, suspense, From Russia With Love has it all.As the film unfolds, the British Secret Service has been contacted by a Russian cipher clerk, Tatiana Romanova (Daniela Bianchi), with an offer that she is willing to defect to the West and provide them with a Lektor decoding machine, which will allow the British to decode secret Russian transmissions, if they meet one criteria the individual who comes to Istanbul to collect her and the decoder must be James Bond (Sean Connery). Immediately, Bond and his superior, M (Bernard Lee), suspect a trap, and it is indeed one, with the orchestrator being the worldwide criminal organization SPECTRE. Two SPECTRE agents, Colonel Klebb (Lotte Lenya) and Kronsteen (Vladek Sheybal), assisted by SPECTRE henchmen Red Grant (Robert Shaw,) have created a plan to allow Bond and Tatiana to escape with the decoder, but eventually deliver it to SPECTRE and not the British. However, Bond and his Istanbul associate, Kerim Bay (Pedro Armendariz), have some plans of their own, and are determined to allow the decoder to make it all the way back to England.From Russia With Love was one of Ian Fleming's more popular Bond novels, reportedly a favorite of President Kennedy, so it is somewhat unsurprising that it was translated into one of the better loved Bond films. The film has a plot that would not be considered especially complicated, but it isn't the most straightforward of stories either, involving a lot of false moves and surprises around the corner. It also puts the audience in the driver's position to some degree, showing us almost every move the film makes and giving us the enjoyment of seeing Bond make his way through it and deduce all the villains actions throughout the film. From Russia With Love was close to end of the era where Fleming's novels were adapted somewhat closely, and From Russia With Love holds up as a reasonably involved story.However, as any modern viewer of a James Bond film knows, a good Bond film is all about three things the action set-pieces, the villain and the girl. From Russia With Love has some memorable moments throughout, including a fight at a gypsy camp where Bond and Bay hide out and a long involved sequence on a train as Bond and Tatiana attempt to escape Istanbul with SPECTRE agent Grant on their tail. Bond hadn't quite pushed to the edge of higher-octane action, but the mix of old fashioned fisticuffs and chases work well, making From Russia With Love a film that has its outrageous sides at times but still with most of its feet planted on the ground.From Russia With Love was the first Bond film to introduce what would become a series staple, and that was the ruthless, murderous henchman. Here it is Red Grant, played well by Robert Shaw, with the appropriate degree of both malice and sophistication when necessary. He is a ruthless individual and a worthy adversary for Bond. Daniela Bianchi is a good female foil for Bond, although her character is a bit on the silly side at times, and many modern viewers will probably find her someone anachronistic compared to modern female characters. She is a bit too flighty at moments, but still pulls off the role well.Connery is once again in top form as Bond, and here he shows off his portrayal of the character's almost unbreakable cool demeanor, such as when he seems to leisurely walk through a shootout in the gypsy camp sequence while all hell breaks loose.

Meanwhile Diane has a bright future in front of her but yet managed to go through school without really being friends with anyone but her father. When Lloyd finally gets the courage to ask her out she accepts and finds that she enjoys her company and that this is the world she has been missing out on. However will their growing friendship go anywhere with Diane destined for a scholarship in England?Like many people I knew this film from the famous image of Lloyd holding a ghetto-blaster above his head, but I had never seen the film or known anything about it until recently. The film opens on fairly typical teen territory and I settled in for what I expected (knew?) would bring just what I expected from it. In a way this is what it did do because the basic narrative arch and characters are familiar and it is solid and enjoyable in this regard. However the film is better than the basics would suggest because it has a smart script in Crowe's impressive feature debut. The story has more to it than the romance and in this way it deepens the characters. Of course it is still a teen movie so it is not as deep as all that but it is refreshing different from the majority of the films where the action focuses entirely on the young couple.With this approach Mahoney works well with a character that has real interest and complexity and his character is much better than I expected as a result. Cusack does equally as well with a gently quirky character with dignity and humour &#150; he contrasts well with his peers, most of who are the clichés associated with the genre but are mocked a bit for it. Skye is good but takes a while to get to the good material &#150; for the majority she does what the genre requires but is better with better material later on. The support cast features mostly solid performances from a cast of actors on their way to fame &#150; Taylor, Piven, Hall and others are surprise finds.Overall then this is a genre teen romance and is good on that level. However the writing and performances are better than the genre average and make for a much more interesting and engaging film that should be liked by the majority of viewers as long as you don't dislike the genre itself.

I'd heard so many great things about it, how it was more or less a filmed nightmare, incredibly weird, and even, mindblowing. The high contrast b&w cameras, the strange and creepy imagery...all sound great in theory. But unfortunately, in reality, it's a film made by David Lynch.I can enjoy plots that develop slowly. I'm a huge Hitchcock fan. I even loved M. Night's Unbreakable, when most thought it was mind-numbing. But this is slow for the sake of being slow. Mr. Lynch isn't trying to build tension or eeriness, it seems slow because he didn't know what to film next and so just kept filming the same thing longer than he should have.I can--and usually do!--enjoy weird movies that don't make much sense (Or at least end with a violent upsurge of orthogonality) Pi, Itchi the Killer, Tetsuo, even 2001 A Space Oddyssey -- all films I loved. But Eraserhead tries too hard. It nearly doubles over backwards to give you weird, imagery, but Lynch never stops to wonder just how interesting the image is. In every scene I can hear him mumbling to himself in the editing room, Look at that! Isn't that cool! Ooooooooh!, and meanwhile I'm watching the screen, thinking Nope. Not really. In sum, this film is a young David Lynch trying as hard as he possibly can to do something strange, and succeeding I suppose, at the cost of a good movie. It's probably worth watching just so you can be conversant on it, since it seems to be such a staple of the weird-film-subculture, but, quite frankly, if this was my nightmare, I'd wake up bored.
