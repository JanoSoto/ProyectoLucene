I think that In the Company of Men (ICM) is a great movie. Everyone gives their reasons, but I think people did not pinpoint it. I will try to do just so.First, it is a movie about men. Not that the movie would have been any different if the leads (Howard and Chad) were played by female. The point is that the movie would have been much more complex and probably too difficult to comprehend if not for flat females. Basically, there are only three females in the movie and even though Christine (deaf girl) occupies quite a lot of screen time, she is just a filler.Second, the movie is anti-political correctness in the most intelligent way. Nobody gets killed, there are no unnecessary profanities but it packs a punch to PC and to the whole Hollywood machine of producing happy movies. The movie says things that we all already know Sometimes the worst people get everything. With the sense of escapism surrounding most American movies, this is a refreshing movie that actually plays by the rules of Hollywood. It makes people feel bad because they got used to feeling good. This duality of screen and real life became so much the part of our lives that we are shocked when we are shown the life as it is.Third, the camera work, editing, music, dialogue, etc. are not that great. You do not see great effects, there is no edge in editing, the movie has a sleazy-tv-soap-opera feel to it. Nothing more. And this is the whole point of the movie. The surrounding, the people, anonymous bars... we unconsciously associate with all that. There is nothing to prevent us from doing so. Gummo, Kids, Tetsuo... even Blade, they are all non-PC, but their plots leave an element of escapism, the situation seem unreal or at least too far away to worry.But ICM scraps all the escapism in order for you, the viewer, to finally engage into the movie that actually makes you feel bad.This, I think is the greatest achievement of ICM.

Time has told us repeatedly that disaster movies, especially natural disaster movies, fill a laughable space in movie-dom, where soap opera characters, lame plot twists, and poor writing fill every inch of the frame, every minute of the film. And this one is no exception. (Neither is Armageddon, but that's a different story.)Deep Impact fails miserably on a few levels. The first is the shallow attempts at characters. There were too many, as is usually the case in these films, and they have no depth. Instead, they are given obvious, average traits, and made to act in ways that would allow the audience to easily identify with them. They were stand-ins for the audience, where most people could say that man\/woman is just like me, or someone I know, and wouldn't it be horrible if that happened to us?, and the movie could get away without developing them past the lowest common denominator of all generic characters.All the emotions, then, are simply there to manipulate us, and take our emotions in the direction the movie wants. Many fine movies do this, in one way or another, and I'd let that go, if it were the only flaw It isn't. None of the emotions come off as genuine. The acting is flat, the direction weak, and the script isn't concerned with any development beyond manipulation. None of it means anything, in the context of the film.And then there's the special effects.

And that isn't a plus, ultimately.The direction, if we're to call it that, is bad. Mimi Leder has yet to do a good job directing anything, and from the bland cinematography to the uninspired acting, this is no bid for respectability. Big script disappointments include never even glimpsing the underground haven, and having the end fizzle with some rather unrealistic, last-minute, feel-good moments that are as implausible as anything in Armageddon.I guess, because this movie is very conventional, and because it's a lot nicer than Armageddon in tone, people might like it more.

(I'm not interested in any old lady comments about it being too loud, or too fast. Those traits alone don't make it bad.)

Strangely enough, while I see many differences between the two, both films had a very similar impact on me.  These films, along with The Big Lebowski, just didn't do anything for me besides alternately bore and annoy me, with no let-up or contrast.I don't know what it is, something about how a film can put on airs, a certain flavor of airs, and then have multitudes falling all over themselves singing its praises.  But there's nothing there.Specific to A Simple Plan, I have these complaintsPredictability there was nothing new or interesting to       discover in the story, nothing that hadn't been done many times before in film, in almost exactly the same way.  No surprises, no doubt (in my mind at least) what would occur from one scene to the next.There was nothing beneath the immediately apparent surface.  No complex subtext.  Nothing to think about.The whole set-up was contrived.  What lesson was I supposed to learn from this?  That big-name Hollywood filmmakers can show us unremitting stupidity and pointlessness through a solid two hour stretch?  Lesson long since learned, folks.  Move on to something else, in the name of all that's sacred!I didn't sympathize in any way with any of the characters.  And every other action a character took, _even in the context of finding this huge amount of money_, seemed completely random and without justification (in story terms).I didn't even find the cinematography to be that great.  I don't know what people are gushing about.  Filming snow doesn't automagically make what you're doing art, to my mind.  You want great lenswork, check out Seven or Heat (for just two arbitrary examples out of many that blow this thing away).  And seeing Paxton's face filling 85% of the screen (not to mention Billy Bob's) for drawn-out lengths of time didn't rub me in quite a pleasing manner.This is just another in a string of movies that has me asking What's the big deal?.  And What's the point?  It's probably just a matter of taste. I've never been much of a one for the random-series-of-supposedly-shocking-events genre.

It was just as cold then as it was when they were all in the water! But, despite these things, TITANIC got all that it deserved.  It was everything people want to see in a movie.  Personally, I think that at times the whole love story was a little drawn out, but it's not the love story that makes the movie this time.

Just stop and take in the horror of the sinking and the detailed account of the times and what it would have been like to be a third class person and know that you haven't even a chance to live.

The one thing he did not run away from was Jenny, in fact he was running to Jenny. This emotional love-story may be a little storybook but it shows the power of love in everyone, even the handicapped.This film was excellent, I don't see how anyone could give it anything under 7\/10 stars.I personally give it 9\/10.

The god-awful clones of Tarantino pouring out of indie and mainstream studios alike should not, however, detract from the brilliance and subtlety of this movie. It works simply because those moments of brilliance (I have to admit I know the whole Jules redemption-speech by heart) that its imitators lack come in the midst of the camp and gore they all do so well. Tarantino alone uses an adolescent obsession with shallowness and morbidity to high satirical effect--like all great films (or even novels), this movie sets itself into a two-dimensional genre (absurd, pop-culture, comic-book situations) and then undermines its own genre by exposing the heart and soul underneath. There are too many points in the movie in which this happens to mention, but a few come to mind the blown kiss from Vincent to Mia at the end of the first (or maybe second) story; the death of Vincent; the obvious emotional dedication of Butch to his wife at the end of his own story; Vincent's unwillingness to believe in his own supernatural salvation without realizing he's doomed; and, of course, the climactic speech. With the exception of Jules's final words, many of these moments seem at first to be horrifying or funny--but this is only because they fit so well into the flow of the script. A second glance shows them to be moments so poignant that the only reason they work is because they are so unique to the characters and their situations. The changes in each (or the lack of change) come, in a sense, as they individually choose to either drive for them or fall behind. Most die-hard fans of the movie, I'm sure, have heard the story of the briefcase and the band-aids on the back of Wallace's neck (the entire movie being a quest to bring back his stolen soul), and although Tarantino has denied it, he can't deny that the movie is full of such heroic themes escape by trial, the reclamation of past, love as both physical salvation and personal security, a will to believe in something beyond one's own selfish world. I won't say that if you don't like this movie that you're mistaken or ignorant, but I think that Tarantino puts his audience into settings much like his characters are in cheap, full of profanity and nastiness, fleeting. The best of them break through; I think he asks that anyone watching do the same.
