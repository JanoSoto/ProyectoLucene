This is not a comedy or a fantasy. It is a drama which gives us insight into something most of us have thought about but found it hard to conceive; the thought of what it is like to be somebody else. Added to this is the puppeteers' skill in learning how to control the character Malkovich, actually becoming himself again but in a different body; all he wants is the name of a star to be able to continue his passion and means of escape. So the means of escape is not being somebody else, its having circumstances to pursue your dreams...we are all hampered in our dreams by achievable things, such as money, or gaining recognition, but we are easily discouraged. So the film is not about being someone else, it is about realizing your potential and achieving recognition.Malkovich comes across as dull and everyday; we see him, through the portal, doing everyday things; such as showering, reading the paper, dating...nothing special. It is only when the puppeteer is in control that we see Malkovich earning recognition...such as the TV report and the standing ovation. To Malkovich acting is just a job; he is nothing like the mysterious, sinister, witty character we often see him playing...when he was asked why he liked acting he gave a very bland, uninspiring reply.The world is full of souls who believe they have no satisfaction in life or creative outlet, unlike the puppeteer, for example those lining up to be somebody else for 15 minutes were looking for brief escape from themselves. Of course we would all like that from time to time, so another theme may be the human condition of being trapped in our own heads; but no magical escape for us. But why would we want to be someone else; even movie stars are basically like us, they simply have work that makes them well known...so the main character's aim is to use this notoriety to his own ends, his OWN. Initially it was a basic animal instinct to have sex with a woman he desired, but he soon realized what this Malkovich face could do for him. So I think the writer is advising us to forget about envying other people, it is not only impossible to be them but even if you were them you would not find fulfillment. Be happy with what God gave you and use what you have to the best of your advantage. The old people regenerating were a symbol of the pathos of wishing to live forever. Seize the day!

But it's not because I am an uneducated film viewer or anything like that. Rather, it is because there was nothing to understand. The movie starts off with a shot of an undressed Kidman and revolves around sex and lust for the first forty five minutes or so. Then we have about an hour of nothing, an adventure that Cruise embarks on that leads us to the final scene, which is Kidman delivering the last few lines You know what we have to do now? F*ck. The movie remains one dimensional, never exploring any of the characters Cruise meets along the way, such as Leelee Sobieski's nyphomaniac teenager, and her father her approves, or Domino, the HIV-positive prostitute. Perhaps if the film began exploring some of these much more interesting characters, it would have turned into an interesting, provocative film. Instead, the film drags on for an hour only to result in the same thing we open up to. Every other scene has a nude woman and overall, it gets to be too much the orgy, the models, the reoccuring scene of Kidman and the naval officer that Cruise keeps seeing in his head ... it's overwhelming.The acting is nothing special at all. Kidman's fluttery laugh bothered me, and Cruise's blank stare (is he discovering something? is he coming to a realization? what are we gaining by looking at his blank face??), which was the center of too many scenes, is, quite frankly, boring.The only reason to see this movie is because of the color scheme. Like in Amelie, Kubrick focused on two main colors for the entire movie (a golden glow and a bright blue), and put in occasional bright reds and purples. Also, notice the always-apparent Christmas tree, in practically every apartment or store.This is an extremely slow movie. It is not enjoyable, and leaves the viewer confused and exasperated. It seems as though everyone was cast on a physical basis alone Kidman and Cruise do make a beautiful couple, and all of the women are at least half nude throughout the entire film. But the talent is lacking. I recommend an earlier Kubrick, especially The Killing. They are much better than this piece of a sexual thriller.

Every other scene has a nude woman and overall, it gets to be too much the orgy, the models, the reoccuring scene of Kidman and the naval officer that Cruise keeps seeing in his head ... it's overwhelming.The acting is nothing special at all. Kidman's fluttery laugh bothered me, and Cruise's blank stare (is he discovering something? is he coming to a realization? what are we gaining by looking at his blank face??), which was the center of too many scenes, is, quite frankly, boring.The only reason to see this movie is because of the color scheme. Like in Amelie, Kubrick focused on two main colors for the entire movie (a golden glow and a bright blue), and put in occasional bright reds and purples. Also, notice the always-apparent Christmas tree, in practically every apartment or store.This is an extremely slow movie. It is not enjoyable, and leaves the viewer confused and exasperated. It seems as though everyone was cast on a physical basis alone Kidman and Cruise do make a beautiful couple, and all of the women are at least half nude throughout the entire film. But the talent is lacking. I recommend an earlier Kubrick, especially The Killing. They are much better than this piece of a sexual thriller.

But it's not because I am an uneducated film viewer or anything like that. Rather, it is because there was nothing to understand. The movie starts off with a shot of an undressed Kidman and revolves around sex and lust for the first forty five minutes or so. Then we have about an hour of nothing, an adventure that Cruise embarks on that leads us to the final scene, which is Kidman delivering the last few lines You know what we have to do now? F*ck. The movie remains one dimensional, never exploring any of the characters Cruise meets along the way, such as Leelee Sobieski's nyphomaniac teenager, and her father her approves, or Domino, the HIV-positive prostitute.

The with lots of flashbacks we walk through his life ever since his wife was raped and murdered in their home whilst Leonard had his skull bashed against a mirror. To the present, he suffers from short term memory loss, he can't make new memories and only can remember his past and now puts all his efforts into finding the killer of his wife by using notes, pictures and tattoos all over his body with clues and facts to remind him how far he has gotten with his mission, but everyone who knows about his condition messes with him even more.It was a very confusing movie that really didn't have an ending at all, but I got to see a different prospective, it was almost like you feel sorry for Leonard because he has no idea what he is doing at all and people are using him and he has no clue whatsoever. In another way the condition as he refers to every 5 minutes is some way a payback due to one of his insurance investigations that resembled a case of another person who suffered this condition. It's amazing to see a man doing everything in his power above his limits trying to keep everything in prospective even though he forgets about it a few minutes after.Guy Pearce was great in this movie as Leonard, who lets people know the problem he has yet doesn't want anybody to pity him so he stays strong in his struggle. It's great to see Guy has come so far ever since he left the Australian series Neighbours.I rate this movie 8\/10, the plot was great, but it did confuse me.

It is, without a doubt, the best Batman film there has been, and credit must go to the director Tim Burton for really capturing the essence of the story. In all the other Batman films, bar Batman Returns, the whole image that has been presented has been over the top, and just like a comic book. Now, I know that this is how Batman originated, but that was not how he was supposed to be seen. Batman, as a superhero in general, is dark and sinister - a force that we do not understand, who appears in places that are unexpected. He is mysterious and Tim Burton is able to capture that in this film. His direction is faultless and that, mixed with the superb music score really helps to bring the idea of Batman and Gotham City alive.Michael Keaton must be one of the least likely of Batman's. His whole image is not one of a superhero, and yet, in my opinion he is the best there has been. He brings an innocence, and yet obvious intelligence to the character. We are able to distinguish between the hero side and the Bruce Wayne side, however, they are not so removed from one another it is unbelievable. He is powerful but not in an arrogant way, in short, the perfect image for Batman. Kim Basinger is also a worthy mention as she plays her part very well, adding to the film tremendously.However, although both Keaton and Basinger do superb jobs, the climax of the film for me has to be Jack Nicholson as the Joker. I am not normally a Nicholson fan, but in this film he never fails to bowl me over. The way he plays such an infamous and well established character is amazing, and the Joker is easily one of the best cartoon villains of all time. I cannot think of anyone who could have done it better. The way he moved, spoke and his general persona was flawless, and the way he delivers his lines never fails to amuse and astound me. If you want to see an example of acting at its best, this is it.In short, this movie is nothing short of fantastic and I recommend to anyone who likes a sense of adventure, humour and a good old fashioned battle between the very good, and the pure evil.

I knew it was supposed to be a retelling and not a summary of the series, but even on that level, I didn't really get Hitomi's reason for caring so much for Van all of a sudden, why that blonde captain (Allen, as I learned later) was even there, or what the hell Dune (or Folken, take your pick) was all about.  The confrontation with Dune was so incredibly anti-climactic that I almost hoped for that old horror cliche of the villain coming back to life a few times to up his kill stats.  No such luck, though.Having just gone through a marathon session with the series (all twenty-six episodes in two days), I decided to watch the movie again this morning.  Well, I had fun identifying all the characters from the series, who were all--down to the cat girls--developed into realistic characters throughout the television series, and it was kind of interesting to compare Hitomi's character (in the movie, she's totally depressed but realized the pain she was causing others; in the series, she was lively, but in being so, she missed the signs that she was hurting people).  However, the story (which recasts Hitomi as a Winged Goddess figure instead of a girl with skills at fortune telling, and Van into an uncontrollably violent person, but sweet and gentle when he's not killing people) isn't all that interesting (and seems to have been more influenced by the Evangelion series and movies than by Escaflowne), and 96 minutes is far too short a time to tell what should have been a sweeping epic.  Instead, despite the claims that it is a retelling, it ends up feeling even more like a truncation of the series.That said, I thought the animation was good (in an anime genre sort of way--I wouldn't expect a lot of other people to care too much for it, the way that even anime haters tend to like Studio Ghibli films), and the design for Hitomi, though not as kawaii as the series, really did fit with the darker tone of the movie.6\/10 ","genre":"Adventure, Animation, Drama"},{"date":"5 January 2003","score":"8 out of 12 people found the following review useful","review":"  First of all, I watched this movie once before I even saw any of the series, so I was fairly confused--especially by the amount of characters who appear for a few minutes and then disappear.

After watching the main titles, it was obvious i would watch it all, and i'm glad i did.The story, for what its worth, centres around a small Jewish community in the 19th century, vying for control of a new train station so that enough people will visit their village so as to allow them to continue praying together. However, the more illustrious local Christians want the station for themselves and begin to put into motion a course of events which will sway the squire (Rutger Hauer) to give them the rights to the land.This is merely a part of the film. Its real focus is on the many characters it establishes and develops in a very short amount of time. Central is poor beggar and sometime magician Simon who is losing his faith due to the hatred shown him by his fellow Jews. Then there is Dovid, played with gentle grace by Stuart Townsend - ostensibly the star - who heads up the plans for the station and agrees to read and comment on the squire's poetry to curry favour with him. His relationship with the squire, his bride to be (Embeth Davitz, magnificent as always) and a beautiful, learned girl are the heart of the film.What makes the film so memorable, however, is in Simon's journey away from his people into the arms of the Christians, only to be used as a weapon against the faith he has run from. Highlights include his conversations with the Satan-like Ian Holm - who convinces Simon of Jews' inherent evil - and his journeys along the railroad, of which he has no understanding and which he believes to be the means by which souls travel to the afterlife. These sequences are so visually poetic that any pretension therein is forgiveable.Yet while writer\/director Ben Hopkins is obviously concerned with issues of education, tolerance, spirituality and all forms of love and forgiveness, there is room for quiet moments of humour. Simon's early introductory scenes are witty and warm, making his subsequent actions all the more cruel on the part of the other characters. The local barman, whose idea of God is a beer glass which never empties, has few scenes but creates a sympathetic rounded character, as do many of the minor performers.Inexplicably critically reviled by some British journalists, this film would appeal to anyone with a taste for off-beat European cinema or anyone looking for a character piece or something a little different. It seemed at first to be many separate things - at first i thought it to be a literary costume drama, then a period version of Finding Forrester, but of course, with all films of quality it is not one thing nor the other, but a combination of many elements woven together masterfully. Ben Hopkins is, on the basis of this, an interesting talent and all involved should be applauded for their excellent work.You can bet if this film were in French or Polish, critics would lavish praise upon it.

After watching the main titles, it was obvious i would watch it all, and i'm glad i did.The story, for what its worth, centres around a small Jewish community in the 19th century, vying for control of a new train station so that enough people will visit their village so as to allow them to continue praying together. However, the more illustrious local Christians want the station for themselves and begin to put into motion a course of events which will sway the squire (Rutger Hauer) to give them the rights to the land.This is merely a part of the film. Its real focus is on the many characters it establishes and develops in a very short amount of time. Central is poor beggar and sometime magician Simon who is losing his faith due to the hatred shown him by his fellow Jews. Then there is Dovid, played with gentle grace by Stuart Townsend - ostensibly the star - who heads up the plans for the station and agrees to read and comment on the squire's poetry to curry favour with him. His relationship with the squire, his bride to be (Embeth Davitz, magnificent as always) and a beautiful, learned girl are the heart of the film.What makes the film so memorable, however, is in Simon's journey away from his people into the arms of the Christians, only to be used as a weapon against the faith he has run from. Highlights include his conversations with the Satan-like Ian Holm - who convinces Simon of Jews' inherent evil - and his journeys along the railroad, of which he has no understanding and which he believes to be the means by which souls travel to the afterlife. These sequences are so visually poetic that any pretension therein is forgiveable.Yet while writer\/director Ben Hopkins is obviously concerned with issues of education, tolerance, spirituality and all forms of love and forgiveness, there is room for quiet moments of humour. Simon's early introductory scenes are witty and warm, making his subsequent actions all the more cruel on the part of the other characters. The local barman, whose idea of God is a beer glass which never empties, has few scenes but creates a sympathetic rounded character, as do many of the minor performers.Inexplicably critically reviled by some British journalists, this film would appeal to anyone with a taste for off-beat European cinema or anyone looking for a character piece or something a little different.

I was hugely disappointed in it for a long while, but as the film progressed I kept wondering if my disappointment was merely a product of my unfair expectations. That's probably the case. I expect a daring comedy from the Brothers Farrelly, but Shallow Hal is surprisingly low-key. It doesn't go for easy laughs, as it easily could have done. The plot concerns a looks-obsessed guy (Jack Black) who is hypnotized into seeing the inner beauty of others. He falls in love with a fat woman who appears to him as Gwyneth Paltrow. When the film came out, a lot of people complained that this was terrible; he only loves her because he is attracted to Gwyneth Paltrow, not the fat incarnation that appears in only a couple of shots in the first 90 minutes of the film. But these people didn't really stick around for the payoff in the third act. What's so surprising about this film is how emotionally involving it is. A lot of this is due to Gwyneth Paltrow, who actually gives one of her best performances. But fans of the Farrelly Brothers, as I am myself, will not be shocked to find that emotional center. It was there in both Kingpin and There's Something About Mary. It's just as fun when the Brothers are mean-spirited, however, as they were in Me, Myself, & Irene and, even better, the unfairly maligned Dumb and Dumber. The serious themes are really on full display here, though. The Brothers have a true and touching affection for physical outsiders. I still wish that they wouldn't have forsaken comedy so much, though. I suppose the only jokes would have been fat jokes, but maybe not. Jason Alexander provides almost all of the good laughs. We wonder why he and Jack Black are so mean about the looks of others when they aren't especially gorgeous themselves. Some people are still asking how such a man as Jason Alexander can be so shallow in this film, but they, as I've said before, didn't stick around until the end.

That said, even with help, Lucas still needs to work on his dialogue and character direction.Make no doubt of it, Lucas is the consummate technology man.  His innovations in sound and video are nothing short of remarkable, and a lot of that is applied here.  And Lucas certainly listened more to his fans on this one by reducing the annoying Jar Jar Binks and giving him a reason for being there (and a real reason to dislike him in the interest of story purposes). More of the elements that made the originals so likeable were put in this film bounty hunters, a larger role for C-3PO and R2-D2 (although Threepio utters some real groaner puns), more lightsaber battles, some ship combat, monster fights....  And yes, these elements did pick up the pace from the last film and help a lot, but it still lacked something.  I think some of the elements were there to keep fans a little more satisfied this time around.Ewan McGregor as Obi-Wan still is an excellent choice for the role. Natalie Portman, while beautiful, still looks uncomfortable in this film, as if she's not really sure of how to handle the character interaction or dialogue (which is unfortunate, because she really is a great actress).  And as a side note, the DVD version of the film removes the disbelief of her quick recovery of one of her falls later in the film.  Hayden Christensen is another actor who seems to be really uncomfortable with the dialogue (both he and Portman seem like they're about to choke on any romance related conversation, making the love affair seem less passionate and more confused).  However, in Christensen's defense, his speech after facing the Tusken Raiders is very effective and chilling for what the character of Anakin Skywalker needs to be.  The familiars from the original films do their jobs well, Temuera Morrison makes for a better Fett character, and Samuel L. Jackson is finally allowed to cut loose (and heads) in this film.By far, the best elements of this film are the final battle sequences, which is a true CG wonderland.  This is where Lucas excels, and it shows.  The pre-Clone War battles are heavy with action, and the Yoda battle seems to remain a fan favorite.Lucas needs to remain in charge of the visuals, and naturally, be the final say for how the story ends\/begins.  However, although not likely, he needs to let someone else work on the dialogue (leaving Lucas for approval, but little else), and perhaps have someone on set to better work on directing the actors in terms of motivation and direction.  He has a truly great and talented cast, and they need to be used as such.  His work on American Graffiti and the original Star Wars were great, but I think 25-30 years later, some of the artistic tastes have definitely changed about the man.To recap Episode II is by far a better film than its predecessor, but it still wasn't the topper to Empire Strikes Back.  Hopefully the criticisms from this film will be applied to Episode III, and like this film, be crafted into a more satisfying product than the one before.

As if the baffling plot development isn't bad enough, the role of Saruman in the story is greatly misrepresented, texture building subplot roles such as Bombadill and Butterbur were simply removed, and what were the Sacksville Bagginses (so critical to the book plot in the end) doing in this movie if they only got one (rather bewildering) reference. I could go on for hours about missing characterizations but suffice to say the difference between book and movie in this arena is horrific, and in point of fact, fatal.Certainly the 'graphics' were nice, but so what. Amazing graphic hacking and hewing of monsters in a mountainous setting is a dime a dozen these days. Big deal.And, Hugo Weaving as Elrond was ridiculous.

","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"5 January 2003","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":"  Michael Mann is easily one of the most talented and interesting American film makers from the early eighties to this day. His filmography includes the legendary TV series Miami Vice (1984) as well as the cult horror film The Keep (1983) with incredible Tangerine Dream soundtrack, The Last of the Mohicans (1992), Heat (1995) with Al Pacino and Robert de Niro and this first film to introduce Hannibal Lecter (or Lecktor as in the film), Manhunter (1986), an extremely stylish and restrained serial killer thriller that has more depth, intelligence and impact than most of the later and previous serial killer thriller attempts.William Petersen from William Friedkin's nihilistic To Live and Die in L.A. (1985) stars in Manhunter as Will Graham, a former FBI agent who is asked to come back for one case by his colleaque (Dennis Farina) as a brutal and totally unknown serial killer has attacked already two times at the time of full moon. The police and FBI are helpless and don't know how to get the murderer and stop the horrible killings. Graham was the one who caught Hannibal Lecter three years ago so the force knows his abilities and decides to ask him for help. He agrees, no matter what he's promised to his understanding wife (Kim Greist) and son (David Seaman), and soon starts to fall deeper and deeper into the mind of the disturbed killer that he is so willing to capture before the next full moon.The film is based on the Thomas Harris book Red Dragon and the subsequent 'Hannibal films', the academy award winning Silence of the Lambs (Jonathan Demme, 1991), Hannibal (Ridley Scott, 2001) and Red Dragon (Brett Ratner, 2002) can be seen as sequels to this earlier Mann film. Manhunter does not concentrate too much on the Hannibal character as he is not among the lead characters here. He is played by the British Brian Cox with great and menacing charisma that went even further in the later films where the psychopath doctor was played by Anthony Hopkins. Manhunter's greatest power lies in its depiction of the killer (Tom Noonan, a very tall and scary looking guy!) himself as he is not just depicted as faceless animal without any other meaning to be in the film than just killing.There are many strong emotional moments in the film and one of the greatest is the one in which the killer, perhaps for the first time ever in his life, falls in love and starts to care about someone. As he lies in the bed with the sleeping girl and looks into the roof and holds her hand it is again so obvious how powerful cinema can be and is without any words or dialogue. Rarely have I seen anything like this what happens when he puts her unconscious hand on his face to cover his mouth. This wordless and silent scene tells very much about the killer character and (thus) about some very important things that should be included in human life in order to live balanced and with one's own feelings. Still the killer character in my opinion desires to be even more detailed and told about his motives and background (no matter how powerful the mentioned scene is) as all we get to learn about him after all is what Graham gets analyzed and revealed about him. In order to get him, Graham starts to think like him and act like him, and that is what scares the others as he had some very severe mental problems using the same technique while chasing Lecktor. He just has to beware of not crossing the line.Also the various dark sides of human nature are touched here especially in the scenes depicting Graham character's journey inside himself and his feelings when he comes closer and closer to insanity and wickedness he finds from the killer and Dr. Lecktor, too. Hannibal's character is again devilishly wise and calculating and he knows what are the weakest sides of Graham and he surely will use his intelligence against them in order to break the man. Some very interesting things are included in the discussions between Hannibal and Graham as for instance the morale and even enjoyment and instinct of killing get discussed in the most difficult way and point but the conclusion still (fortunately) is that Graham just visits the border but never crosses it, and that border is exactly the one that should not be crossed by anyone and it just should be recognized, admitted and kept on the background and away.The visuals and other magic elements of cinema are here as brilliant as can be expected from the director Mann. Cinematography by Italian Dante Spinotti is fantastic, powerful and still very restrained and none of the elements and techniques used are in vain or without their purpose. They are there to depict the atmosphere and feelings of the characters', all characters, and the result is genuinely visual, not artificially so. The lighting, the angles, the drives and everything are perfectly balanced with the hypnotic soundtrack by Reds and Michel Rubini. The beginning at the Leeds apartment features some of the creepiest images and moments I've seen in cinema and the photography and camerawork are here as important as the soundtrack. And Manhunter is not the only film by Mann that has soundtrack as wonderful as this the Tangerine Dream music in The Keep is perhaps even more hypnotic and magical.The finale is also worth mentioning as it includes very innovative and heart stoppingly effective and unconventional camerawork and editing as they used various techniques and camera speeds to achieve the effect. The slow motions and edits really show how talented Mann is also as a cameraman and he likes to work very closely in the cinematography department in his own films, too. The lighting and gorgeous neo, green, purple and other colors and lights coming through the windows and camera lenses are something as wonderful as those in the greatest efforts from Hong Kong, like Bride With White Hair (Ronny Yu, 1993) and Dr. Lamb (Danny Lee and Billy Tang, 1992) to name just a few. Michael Mann has the kind of sense of visual style and striking storytelling that he, alongside Sam Peckinpah and Kathryn Bigelow, is perhaps the closest Western equivalent to the Eastern directors especially and also when it comes to kinetic and fierce action. If you are in doubt, watch Mann's Heat and its incredible city war sequence in the middle part of the film.Manhunter is the kind of film that makes me love American cinema and (these few American) directors as when they're talented, they're very talented and it is great thing to have makers like Mann active in the industry. Manhunter is among his best achievements and also among the most powerful and memorable American films of the eighties. 9\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"5 January 2003","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":"  Michael Mann is easily one of the most talented and interesting American film makers from the early eighties to this day. His filmography includes the legendary TV series Miami Vice (1984) as well as the cult horror film The Keep (1983) with incredible Tangerine Dream soundtrack, The Last of the Mohicans (1992), Heat (1995) with Al Pacino and Robert de Niro and this first film to introduce Hannibal Lecter (or Lecktor as in the film), Manhunter (1986), an extremely stylish and restrained serial killer thriller that has more depth, intelligence and impact than most of the later and previous serial killer thriller attempts.William Petersen from William Friedkin's nihilistic To Live and Die in L.A. (1985) stars in Manhunter as Will Graham, a former FBI agent who is asked to come back for one case by his colleaque (Dennis Farina) as a brutal and totally unknown serial killer has attacked already two times at the time of full moon. The police and FBI are helpless and don't know how to get the murderer and stop the horrible killings. Graham was the one who caught Hannibal Lecter three years ago so the force knows his abilities and decides to ask him for help. He agrees, no matter what he's promised to his understanding wife (Kim Greist) and son (David Seaman), and soon starts to fall deeper and deeper into the mind of the disturbed killer that he is so willing to capture before the next full moon.The film is based on the Thomas Harris book Red Dragon and the subsequent 'Hannibal films', the academy award winning Silence of the Lambs (Jonathan Demme, 1991), Hannibal (Ridley Scott, 2001) and Red Dragon (Brett Ratner, 2002) can be seen as sequels to this earlier Mann film. Manhunter does not concentrate too much on the Hannibal character as he is not among the lead characters here. He is played by the British Brian Cox with great and menacing charisma that went even further in the later films where the psychopath doctor was played by Anthony Hopkins. Manhunter's greatest power lies in its depiction of the killer (Tom Noonan, a very tall and scary looking guy!) himself as he is not just depicted as faceless animal without any other meaning to be in the film than just killing.There are many strong emotional moments in the film and one of the greatest is the one in which the killer, perhaps for the first time ever in his life, falls in love and starts to care about someone. As he lies in the bed with the sleeping girl and looks into the roof and holds her hand it is again so obvious how powerful cinema can be and is without any words or dialogue. Rarely have I seen anything like this what happens when he puts her unconscious hand on his face to cover his mouth. This wordless and silent scene tells very much about the killer character and (thus) about some very important things that should be included in human life in order to live balanced and with one's own feelings. Still the killer character in my opinion desires to be even more detailed and told about his motives and background (no matter how powerful the mentioned scene is) as all we get to learn about him after all is what Graham gets analyzed and revealed about him. In order to get him, Graham starts to think like him and act like him, and that is what scares the others as he had some very severe mental problems using the same technique while chasing Lecktor. He just has to beware of not crossing the line.Also the various dark sides of human nature are touched here especially in the scenes depicting Graham character's journey inside himself and his feelings when he comes closer and closer to insanity and wickedness he finds from the killer and Dr. Lecktor, too. Hannibal's character is again devilishly wise and calculating and he knows what are the weakest sides of Graham and he surely will use his intelligence against them in order to break the man. Some very interesting things are included in the discussions between Hannibal and Graham as for instance the morale and even enjoyment and instinct of killing get discussed in the most difficult way and point but the conclusion still (fortunately) is that Graham just visits the border but never crosses it, and that border is exactly the one that should not be crossed by anyone and it just should be recognized, admitted and kept on the background and away.The visuals and other magic elements of cinema are here as brilliant as can be expected from the director Mann. Cinematography by Italian Dante Spinotti is fantastic, powerful and still very restrained and none of the elements and techniques used are in vain or without their purpose. They are there to depict the atmosphere and feelings of the characters', all characters, and the result is genuinely visual, not artificially so. The lighting, the angles, the drives and everything are perfectly balanced with the hypnotic soundtrack by Reds and Michel Rubini.
