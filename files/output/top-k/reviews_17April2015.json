[{"date":"17 April 2015","score":"","review":" Following a master's release, a squad of expert vampire hunters sets out to prevent his flock from attaining the single artifact needed to allow vampires to walk in daylight before they succumb to his devious plans.This is easily one of the more enjoyable and overlooked entries in the genre. One of the main elements responsible for this is the rather original and innovative approach it takes in regards to vampires. Not only is this one openly deviant about the proper tools and what doesn't work alone makes for quite a good telling here by including the storyline about the search for the special artifact. Not only is the concept of that particular object rather creative and original but it also allows for the film to turn into a road movie that includes all the trappings devoted to hunting and tracking a vampire clan. This includes the one main method of accomplishing that in the psychic connection between the un-turned victim and the master, again a rather novel touch that produces a lot of fun. That doesn't include the main reasons why this one works so well in the actual hunting down of the vampires, which there's plenty of within this. This one manages to really make the hunters quite impressive by utilizing special tactics and maneuvers that clearly showcase some experience in their field which is what really impresses since it routinely works rather than the stereotypical method of having experts continuously fail at their profession simply to drive the movie along. That alone makes this one enjoyable along with the frantic action on display and highly-enjoyable gore scenes which features some rather bloody times throughout this in how both sides have plenty of bloodshed ravaged toward them. These are enough to help this overcome its one true flaw. The final showdown really could've been done more effectively, and really should've had one to begin with. The climactic fight lasts all of about a minute, with a couple stabbings, some minor throwing around and then the big hit. It's really nothing much of a fight and should've been one for such a journey like this to take route. Still there's not a whole lot here that really gets this down.Rated R Extreme Graphic Violence, Graphic Language and Nudity.

One of the better elements here is the rather exciting and plentiful action scenes here that make for a really enjoyable time. The opening of the film is a perfect example of this as it's the rapid on the castle which features the villagers storming the grounds and destroying the foundation while chasing the assistant and the monster through the catacombs and into the graveyard, being quite the highly impressive and exciting start as there's a thrilling sequence immediately. Along that same path, the lightning storm sequence and the rampage through the town following the trial in the hall also manage quite a few fun moments within this, while scenes in the middle at the mansion seems to have quite a nice dose of cheesy fun. The film's best segments, though, are in the final half as there's quite a bit to like here. Starting with the results of the brain-swamp and the resulting double-cross fueled by the emerging townspeople is used to set-up the main action as the monster's attempts to fend them off not only damages those around him but also starts off the centerpiece burning-down-the-house finale through the wild action in place. That not only is this fun due to the action present but also the storyline connections as this series of actions is built because of the fun body-swapping story lines as well as the continuation of the infatuation of the monster with children from the first entry which really helps this one along. They are enough for this one to hold off it's few flaws. One of the biggest marks against this one is the utterly contrive and rather nonsensical story that really eels like cash-in by the throwing yet another relative of Frankenstein's who yet again has extensive knowledge of brain-swapping to carry the film on. It's not all that original or creative at this point in the series which helps keep this one down somewhat. Another big one is the fact that the film doesn't really make it seem important for the creature and the assistant to seem like imposing figures for the townspeople, wandering up through the streets in broad daylight and engaging many of them in conversation that openly declare their association with the infamous family and their intentions there. At first the villagers seem afraid but willing if it gets them on their way, then it doesn't bother them at all until the final third of the film when the monster gets loose and starts rampaging. That's what spurs them into action, many times often ignoring the fact that they're out there despite the fact the creature openly escaped custody.

I expected some kind of cannibal holocaust, wild cruel rites in some dark and remote African, Amazonian or New Guinea settlement. Far from it, we are in a Scottish offshore island, and about to meet a community of neopagans who live happily a rather free and morally relaxed style of life following old pagan rites mixed with Scottish traditions, and spiced with traditional folk music; hippies of the 60's-70's would have loved to live there! Technically the film has its flaws, but the last scene offers something very original which we have hardly ever watched in cinema. Forget about its classification as a horror film, it is not, actually there are many more moments for laugh than frightening ones, yet an atmosphere of mystery is present throughout the film.The plot is essentially a mystery about the disappearance of a girl from the community, the investigation of a just arrived policeman, and the lack of cooperation from the dwellers. There is a very interesting final twist, just before the remarkable last scene.But there is more it. The film contains several layers actually, and below the surface there is a very interesting clash of religious beliefs, and a reflection on the role religion and believing in the supernatural plays in the society (be it the promise of an afterlife made by someone who died in a cross or the belief in reincarnation on the grounds of the natural cycle of life and the gods that govern it all). It was my impression that neither of both are given much credit in the film, so maybe it does contain some kind of subtle atheistic message.In summary, a highly recommended film. The fact that there has been two recent remakes of it (both failed attending to the opinions of IMDb's reviewers) is indicative of the interest and influence The Wicker Man still conserves three decades later.
