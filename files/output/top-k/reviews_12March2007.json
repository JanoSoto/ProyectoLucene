Instead, he's the opposite, such as kind, sweet, and of course, cute. The best roles I have seen him take were Home Alone 1 & 2 and My Girl. It was just very disturbing to see him in this kind of role, playing as an evil kid no one but his cousin suspected evil.This movie, I thought, was both good and bad. The good points about it was the plot and how both the actors, Elijah Wood and Macaulay Culkin acted in it as good and evil. I thought they were excellent as children. They said their lines as how their character would say it and they really got into it. However, the bad points were how Macaulay Culkin had to play an evil little killer, some of the scripts, ratings, and ending. In one part, Mark Evans (Elijah) tells Henry (Mac) that his mother's soul is in Henry's mom. I thought that was completely stupid, because it sounds like possession, not as though cute and grief-stricken. And how Henry used a cigarette and cursed Don't f*ck with me, I was shocked. Why let him say that? Now that really surprised me.The movie is rated R. Why? Because of violence and language. Well, I only counted one cursing, but that's it. The violence was off-screen, so the movie should have been rated PG-13 or at least PG.The ending made me so mad, because Susan (Henry's mom) had to let go of one child when she was holding onto them at the edge of the cliff. I know it was right of her to let go of Henry, but did they have to make that scene? After that, I cried because no matter how evil that child was, it was sad to know he died so young. Of course the movie's fake, but it gave me a stab of grief and how I wish I was never in that situation.

It is the most boring film I've ever seen. I've heard people say they don't want to watch great films that are very long, such as Once Upon a Time in America, because of the length, even though no one ever says it about LOTR. I don't get it, because to be honest this film is poor.I have watched it twice now, and neither time did I see anything good in it. It is just plain boring, they just talk absolute crap for three hours walking through a forest. What is good about that? The worst thing is definitely the hobbits. Why do they give Frodo the ring when he can't fight? Why do they let his friends come when all they do is get the group into trouble? Especially when they are so annoying, mostly Sam, whose vocabulary seems to be limited to the words 'Mr. Frodo'. He drove me insane.The stupidest thing about this film though is that at most points during the film, they could just hide the ring in the snow, or throw it into the forest. As if anyone would find it. There you go, I could do the hobbits 9 hour epic film quest in about 5 seconds.Another annoying thing is that they go 3 hours of boring you to death, and then end up worse than when they started. I don't get that.The ending is really bad. They go 4 full chapters on the DVD rowing 10 metres in a boat. You should always end a film with excitement. Star Wars Empire Strikes Back ends with some classic scenes, despite not being the end of the whole story. Peter Jackson should have done the same with this film.I really don't see the point in having a 3 hour film to set the scene. Most films manage to set the scene in 5-10 mins. I think they could have made this much shorter, and they could have at least put a few more battle scenes in if it's going to be 3 hours.It is ridiculous looking at the top #250 and seeing this in the top #15 in my view, especially with so many really great films way below, such as Raging Bull. I found LOTRFOTR to be a huge disappointment, as I was really looking forward to it due to all the hype. The special effects aren't even that impressive. I think people overrate this film because of all the hype made around it's release.I don't just think it is overrated, I also thought it to be a very poor film, it was incredibly boring and I had no idea what the characters were talking about. It seemed like I would have had to have read the novel to understand the film. There was no action and the hobbits really got on my nerves.

I've long considered New Blood to be one of my favorite films in the F13 franchise, though I'm not exactly sure why, as I really don't think it's any better or any worse than the rest of the series. It could be that I simply enjoy this one more because I haven't seen it a billion times like I have many of the early chapters, so for me New Blood still seems somewhat fresh. (Apart from the original, which I still view from time to time,I really don't feel any particular need to sit through F13's part II, III, Final Chapter or Part V A New Beginning ever again as long as I live.) Since the Friday formula had obviously become rather stale over the course of the previous six films, it was nice to see the writers of Part VII attempting to inject something new to the mix by (FINALLY) introducing a character strong enough to go toe-to-toe with the psychotic Jason, rather than just another terrified teenage girl who gets in a lucky shot with a machete at the last possible second. Thus, as New Blood begins we meet Tina, a troubled girl with psychokinetic\/ESP powers, who accidentally caused her father's death at a Crystal Lake cabin when she was a little girl. Now a teenager, she returns to Crystal Lake for the first time since the accident with her Mom and psychiatrist (played by Terry Kiser of Weekend At Bernie's fame!) in tow, for a bit of face your fears style shock treatment.Of course, in true Friday fashion, the cabin next door to Tina's happens to be well stocked with the usual assortment of teenage party animal F13 victim types (the rich bitch, the sci-fi nerd, the stoner, the yuppies, the tough but sensitive nice guy, etc.) all of whom are ripe for the picking when Tina has a fight with her doctor and heads off to the lake on an emotional burn, where she accidentally awakens Big Jay from his underwater slumber. Jason, of course, grabs the nearest handy sharp objects and begins picking off the occupants of the party animal cabin one by one, until sure enough, the lone survivors of the carnage are Tina and her hunky new boyfriend (the previously mentioned sensitive nice guy). By the time Jason and Tina finally meet face-to-hockey mask, she uses her mental powers to put him through the wringer Carrie style. The last fifteen or twenty minutes of this flick contains some of my favorite moments of mayhem in the entire F13 series, as Tina electrocutes Jason, strangles him with vines, sets him on fire, drops a roof on his head, causes him to fall through a flight of stairs to the basement, and so on. I have to give props to Kane Hodder (playing Jason for the first time here, and who owned the role for many years afterwards, until he was replaced by Ken Kirzinger in Freddy Vs. Jason), because after Tina beats on him for a while he does a very good job of portraying how TICKED OFF Jason must be that a mere girl is actually getting the upper hand on him! (My favorite scene is when she uses her ESP to make a jar full of nails fly into his head and chest; Jason has lost his mask by this time, and when he rips one of the nails out from between his eyes, Hodder\/Jason gives her a hilarious cross-eyed look as if to say Is that the BEST you got? HA!) One major complaint I have about F13 VII is the relative bloodlessness of it all. (Especially when the movie's subtitle is THE NEW BLOOD!) Whether due to tighter MPAA restrictions by the end of the 80s or maybe squeamishness on the part of F13's longtime studio (Paramount), New Blood's gore factor is not very high at all, in fact most of the kill scenes cut away at the very last second so you don't get to see the good stuff. This makes Kiser's death-by-tree-saw scene in particular rather disappointing and weak.(Director John Carl Buechler's original cut of this film was much gorier, but it was subject to massive editing before its release... the un-edited kill scenes can be found on YouTube, by the way, and are quite nasty. Dare we hope for a Director's Cut special edition DVD one of these days with the scenes re-inserted?) The ending of F13 Part VII (which I will not reveal here so I do not violate any SPOILER WARNING rules; all I will say is How many dead people ARE there at the bottom of that lake?) is unfortunately one of the lamest in the entire series (topped only by the end of Part VIII Jason Takes Manhattan), so that takes a few points off of this one, but other than that minor quibble, most of F13 Part VII made me smile and flash back to my teenage horror-geek days for most of its length. Back in the 80s my friends and I had a regular tradition whenever a new Friday movie was released, we'd make sure to go see it on opening night, and this one in particular brings back fun memories for me. Friday THE 13TH PART VII THE NEW BLOOD still holds up as one of the better chapters in the seemingly never-ending saga of Jason Voorhees.

Actually, it was much better and had a surprisingly good cast for such a lightweight cartoon comedy.I mean, who would expect a big star like Elizabeth Taylor to be in this movie? She had the funniest lines, too, I thought. Her put-downs of poor Fred (the rotund John Goodman is perfectly cast) included lines such as, the only good thing you provide for my daughter is shade. This is quite an eclectic cast with the likes of Taylor, Goodman, Rick Moranis, Rosie O'Donnell, Elizabeth Perkins, Kyle MacLaughlan and Halle Berry.As for the kids, there is no language problem in here, although they inserted the obviously- and-purposely misspelled word, fuk on a headline in a newspaper Fred was reading.

The other is (Harold Abrahams) played by Ben Cross, who wants to prove to everyone included the Cambridge society that he belongs and have them look at his personal achievements and not focus so much on him being a Jew.The story is told in flashbacks showing Liddell's and Abraham's journey from simple sprinters to competing in the Olympic games in 1924.It was very heavy going for me to watch as I feel it goes at a slow pace and only seems to get exciting and interesting when the races are happening. I was a little bored with the scenes in-between and found myself zoning out of the movie but when the racing scenes happened I was glued to them and found my heart beating that the men would succeed in their ambition to win a medal.

After the war, the Communists feared they had picked up dangerous Western ideas about freedom. So, they had these heroic Czech pilots thrown into a nightmarish prison, where some of the guards were the same Nazis they risked their lives to defeat.If Hollywood wants to understand why so many of their movies fall flat, they should compare the character drama portions of Pearl Harbor with this movie. In Dark Blue World, you really make a connection to all the characters. In Pearl Harbor, everyone is like some slick cartoon version of a real person.There are innumerable instances of brilliant writing in this movie. One funny scene that sticks in my mind is when the character Karel is being taught English by a rather formal Englishwoman. When he can't pronounce a word, he ridicules the lesson. In typical stoic English fashion, the teacher calmly but forcefully confronts Karel, and shames him into behaving.The aerial battle sequences in this movie are amazing, and they help to keep the movie lively. I read that it cost $11,000 an hour to rent the planes, but it was worth every penny.Ladies, you are expected to cry at sad movies, but guys.... beware! This movie would make General Patton weep.

Dick and W. Burroughs. Blade Runner evolved from their ideas, and is an inspired project that really deserves respect.I was very young when I first saw the movie on its initial release. My friends and I were stunned. We didn't have the wherewithal to properly verbalize what we came away with, but we knew we loved it.This movie accomplishes something very few works do, it provokes that profound sense of how strange it is to be a human being, and that it's truly difficult to imagine any alternative.It's interesting to note that the replicants are referred to in the movies opening as robots when they are in fact organic, genetically engineered...humans. This is an example of how we structure morality on what's convenient or essential for our continuation, not necessarily survival, but so-called progress. In Blade Runner replicants are required for the colonization of other planets. Society side-steps the moral implications, referring to replicants as robots and to killing them as retirement. It's great that the story focuses on these profound issues rather than space battle action type stuff. That is in fact quintessential to the nature of the story, it's not about what happens on the front lines, but in the dark recesses of a world left to die.There's so many cool ideas in this film. There are layers of interconnectedness that reach beyond the story. The fact that the hotel in which Sebastian lives was the hotel used to film the Outer Limits episode Demon with a Glass Hand, which explores similar themes about what it is to be human, is an example.A friend of mine tells me he was instructed by an architect who worked on the film's sets. After filming the architect had the sets burned, so that they wouldn't appear in any subsequent projects. The film makes ample use of stone columns and pylons, and it's great how old structures are situated alongside huge new ones. The backdrops are rich in detail, nothing is plain, and there's strange uncharacteristic things like small fires in the street's gutters.One of the ideas in the film is Philip K. Dick's concept of kipple, the unwanted and useless junk that accumulates and tends to reproduce itself. The Blade Runner world is full of it, and its presence seems to reflect the situation of humanity itself, reproducing, accumulating, spreading through the universe, blind to any purpose, and incapable of knowing what the ultimate outcome will or even can be. The film's dialog also subtly reflects this, Gaff tells Deckerd; It's too bad she can't live, but then again, who does? The different ways of interpreting this statement are typical of the film's deliberate ambiguousness, it's not only a statement about mortality, but existence versus living. Both meanings are equally valid. Fortunately, the story isn't compromised with some kind of resolution, religious salvation, or final answers. It's lack of closure gives it more impact.Technically the movie is brilliant, the look and feel of it aligns perfectly with the story. At first I was disappointed that the director's cut removed the narration, probably because it was the version I was used to. But the director's cut works a little better I think, and it's a bit darker without Harrison Ford's vocal interjections. The movie does have some strange, cheesy quirks, but on repeated viewings they don't have as much impact because you know they're coming.A great film, it's hard to imagine a science fiction film that could equal it.
