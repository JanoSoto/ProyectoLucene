See, what annoys me, is the principal\/rule that some movie goers have, which defies them from admitting to enjoying a remake, however brilliant it is. The remake of Psycho, is in no way brilliant. In fact, in parts, it is very disappointing-Anne Heche and Viggo Mortenson for example, are not as good as they were in previous films. But, the original, also had faults. Casting Anthony Perkins was a big mistake, and despite however many people say how good he was, I think he was terrible. Vince Vaughn is incredibly scary. His nervous laugh as he watches Marion Crane eat the sandwiches he prepared for her, the well executed line She just goes a little mad sometimes, we all goe a little mad some times. His dark stare and smile at the end of the film as he sits looking in the direction of the camera. William H Macy is also an improvement on the original despite the awful hat he wears during his screen time.The casting directors didn't really have a hard time watching loads of films to cast the right people-Julianne Moore starred in Boogie Nights with William H Macy. She also starred in The Lost World Jurassic Park with Vince Vaughn, and he starred in the recent hit, Return To Paradise with Anne Heche.In summary, the new version is slightly better made-it should be after all this time after the original, but I couldn't help thinking that a remake should be ten times better than the first because of the large gap between the two, and how well films have progressed over the ages. This is no indication of how far films have improved.

This film started more than one of its cast on the road to stardom, including Charles Bronson, James Coburn and Steve McQueen.  Brad Dexter, whose character is one of the more interesting in the film, is one who did not go onto big things.  The film was so successful it spawned three forgettable sequels.The first 45 minutes of the film are the most enjoyable for me. The high point is the scene in which Yul Brynner and Steve McQueen drive a hearse up to boothill.  Following this, Yul Brynner and Steve McQueen recruit 5 other gunslingers to defend a Mexican village threatened by a Mexican bandit, played well by Eli Wallach.  The script is wonderful in these early minutes.  Yul Brynner quips I've been offered a lot for my services, but never everything.  Charles Bronson says in a later scene that right now twenty dollars is a lot.  The best line comes at the end of the movie when Brynner tells McQueen that only the farmer's have won.  We lost.  We always lose.The second part of the movie is full of action as Brynner and his companions defend the village.  Ultimately, the villagers grab their tools and join the fight. Guess who wins!Elmer Bernstein's score punctuates the action beginning with the stirring theme familiar to almost everyone.  My favorite cut is when the three villagers ride into the border town to find help.   This cut has recently become available on CD in the original soundtrack.  I never could understand why the soundtrack of this film was not issued at the time.  It's definitely better late than never, however.What didn't I like about the movie.  It bothered me that Brynner wore his hat all the time.  Of course, he was doing the King and I on Broadway at the time, and he had to do that.  It looked silly in many cases.  In one scene the seven and the villagers are building walls in preparation for the coming fight.  Despite the obviously sweaty work, Brynner is wearing is hat.This is a wonderful film to watch.  If you haven't seen it, rent it or, better yet, buy the widescreen version.  You won't be sorry.

So, it seems to me that this film delivered everything the first three films did.  There were flaws, however.

This isn't actually BAD, but I don't think I've ever seen a film so slight.It's not much of a biopic, since we see, roughly, two WEEKS of Whale's life.  Apparently (although Condon tells us that some of the events are fictitious, and gives us no means of working out which ones), towards the end of his life Whale suffered from a kind of brain damage that meant he was plagued by vivid images, stray thoughts, and the like, which accounts for all the flashbacks.  The film is a bit slow to tell us about the brain condition, though, which means that the flashbacks come across as a forced, ham-fisted device.  The impression persists.  Condon tries very hard indeed to draw links between Frankenstein's monster and Whale, the invisible man and Whale, between Whale's films and his experiences in the Great War.

Yes, Whale is having visions, but that's no reason why we should.  Anyway, Whale himself is sick to death of being associated with Frankenstein, and would rather people thought of him as the director of `Show Boat'.The surprisingly good press this film has generated is almost entirely due to Ian McKellen and Brendan Fraser.

As much as we hate to admit it, the film American Beauty brings us face to face with our world, with nothing left as taboo.  Is it the best film of the year?  Quite possibly.  Is it one of the best?  Most definitely.If anyone dares to contradict that statement they obviously didn't understand the film.  The movie has a message, it has a morals behind it. These morals weren't even left for us to figure out.  They were told to us straight out from the beginning through until the end.  Be anything.  Just be happyI must commend the actors in the film.  They all did an excellent job with no exception.  Spacey pulls off what could be the performance of a life time.  Thora Birch finally makes her move into adult movies, and the young new actor, Wes Bentley, makes a unexpected breakthrough performance.This film did what most American movies can't do anymore It kept us interested.  From the first to last moment of the film we were mezmorized. Yet it wasn't by action and explosions.  The audience is entranced by the film's look at the state of the human condition.Many people ask what the film's about.  That's not the point of the movie. The plot's not essential.  It's the characters and what they show us about this world that is.The film will make you laugh unexpectedly.  It may also bring you to tears. Behind the angst in this film is an uplifting message.  Through the drama is a shining light.  And that's what the film American Beauty focuses on. Not the dark moments in life, but the fun that can be had in between.

The question, then, according to this otherwise insightful critic, is Do these strands constitute full stories and interesting movies all by themselves? He thought not, but he missed the point, I think-- and perhaps some audience members did too.Wrong question, wrong everything! That is a solipsism that falls apart. This is a movie about one's realities, and potentials, and all of that. Certainly. But it's not science fiction, it's not fantasy-- it's not a question of, Gee, what if you had magic, or a genie grant you a wish? Such supernatural devices can make fine movies-- such as Big, or Splash, or It's a Wonderful Life. With Sliding Doors, however, it's totally different. Rather, it's an exploration of what it is to be yourself.Spoiler warning!!!
