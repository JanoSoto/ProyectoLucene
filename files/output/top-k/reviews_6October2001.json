Boy was I wrong...The racing scenes aren't intense at all.  Part of the reason for this is the fact that the CGI (which I thought would be great) was like watching a Play Station 2 video game!  The music is relentless and not thrilling whatsoever. The script, by Sylvester Stallone, has little character development through dialogue, but contains some conflict and originality, I'll give Stallone that.  Stallone's acting wasn't bad and neither were some of the other performances, but Burt Reynolds, he's about as dull as they come.  Who let that guy act?Harlin changes angles every two seconds and each shot is too frantic. It gets to be annoying.  But what really did it for me was the pathetically cheesy CGI.I like Stallone and Harlin, but...there really isn't much here, and man am I glad I only spent $2.00 on renting it instead of seeing it in the theaters.It wasn't necessarily the script that made this a bad film, but the production team.  On a more positive note, I don't like car racing, I never have, so maybe people who do will like this movie.

You have to admire the guy for writing dialogue so well. Kevin Smith's first movie, CLERKS was really low-budget, though MALLRATS isn't low-budget, it's not big-budget either, but either way it looks a lot better than CLERKS did. MALLRATS also has a little more plot than CLERKS did too. It starts off with T.S. Quint Jeremy London picking up his girlfriend Brandi Svenning so they can go on a trip to Florida. Unfortunately, Brandi can't go because she promised her father Michael Rooker in his best performance to date that she would be on his game show that takes place at the local mall. T.S. gets upset and she dumps him. He isn't the only one who got dumped. His best friend Brodie Bruce the great Jason Lee has also been dumped by his girlfriend Rene Mosier the beautiful Shannen Doherty. T.S. and Brodie head to the mall where Brandi's father's game show is taking place. While the stage for it is being built, T.S. and Brodie approach Jay Jason Mewes and Silent Bob Kevin Smith to see if they will destroy the stage for them. This leads Jay and Silent Bob into some hilarious attempts to destroy the stage, but sadly, they all fail. After many misadventures including a visit to a fortuane teller with three nipples, T.S. and Brodie finally get their girlfriends back and everyone is happy especially the audience. This is one of those movies that failed at the box office, but found success on video. I didn't see it on video, I saw it on television where it was horribly edited and chopped up.

As Star Wars moves on towards a next generation of fans with new films that in many ways are totally unrelated to the original trilogy, so Spaceballs becomes progressively dated. All films do, of course but Spaceballs was released when Star Wars itself was fresh, and depended on most of its audiences having recently seen Star Wars in the cinema - or having at least having been heavily exposed to it through other forms of media. The Scary Movie franchise which has followed the spate of Scream movies rests heavily on the same premise. With the original Star Wars triumvirate now occupying places on the world's video shelves, Spaceballs is well into its inevitable slide towards obscurity.The thing that inevitably ages fastest in any comedy is the humour itself. Spaceballs' jokes vary in effectiveness. The more slapstick side of things is generally handled well, and remains amusing Dark Helmet being propelled forward into the front of the bridge by the deceleration from Ludicrous Speed, for example; other jokes, such as the sustained 'Asshole' dialogue, are still funny, but a bit puerile for todays' tastes. Film audiences have matured somewhat - Spaceballs' humour will remain for them like a childhood toy amusing to come back to briefly, but, in the long term, unsatisfying.The acting is generally very good, but can never really transcend the plebeian childishness of the script, which itself never really rises above being a series of in-jokes. The one exception here is Rick Moranis, who has been playing childish buffoons since his days as a Ghostbuster, and who draws most of the laughs throughout. The jokes he has to play are not necessarily superior in quality - but his character never has to display any of the cheesy sentimentality or sincerity necessary in places to moving the film forward that at times makes Bill Pullman and Daphne Zuniga's characters seem a little bit over-done in a way that even Brooks wasn't really intending.What of the rest of the package? John Morris' score is a superb spoof in itself, with a suitably pompous and martial main march, a brooding 'Imperial' theme, and plenty of good quality incidental music. The FX, surprisingly, don't grate as much as one might expect, and, unlike some of the costumes, don't strike one as deliberately trying to look low budget. The Winabago, Spaceball 1 - all are carried off well. A final mention should also go to Ronny Graham, whose manically unholy Minister would steal the show had he only been given a bigger part...Ultimately, a spoof only lives as long as its target.

To say that that will always be the case would be foolish Spaceballs' days are thus numbered - but the exact sell-by date remains unknown.

It came at the peak of the 90s, when all the truly great films of the decade (Silence Of The Lambs, Schindler's List, and The Shawshank Redemption) had been done and there wasn't much left to look forward to. Then Mel Gibson decided to do this historical war epic and was able to revitalize the hopes of the great epic genre in our time.I have to admit that I was skeptical at first of this film, mostly because it was directed by an aging star-actor and because it dealt with a historical subject and genre that is usually plagued by cheasy storylines and manipulation of characters. But I have to say that Mel Gibson pulled it off beautifully, despite the fact that it seemed more like his tribute film to himself where he would let the camera make love to him in almost every sequence. Inadvertently, he most likely put together a film that is rarely seen in cinema today. One with a genuine story that is easy to take in, emotionally charged once you let it in, and just beautiful to look at. There is a lot of heart in this film. In the story, in the characters, and in the cinematography. Anyway you look at it, Braveheart is a film that stands out as a real winner, more than almost any other film in the 90s. And while it did borrow much from the filmic styles of the past, it might as well have done so as a symbol of what modern movies should be like. And what is more important is the fact that the story did not overexaggerate the greatness of its characters as much as most historically films do (i.e. Gandhi, The Hurricane). Instead, it gave the character of William Wallace a sense of realism, a sense that he was human too, which really made his goals seem more important to the benefit of not only his people but to the concept of humanity itself.Braveheart doesn't have much complexity or any level of symbolic meaning to it. It's very simple and straight to the point. But it is done very artfully, both objectively and subjectively, as can be seen on the screen. Something like films used to be in the days when cinema was great as an art. Braveheart shows that movies can still achieve this goal of getting film done right.

And while it did borrow much from the filmic styles of the past, it might as well have done so as a symbol of what modern movies should be like. And what is more important is the fact that the story did not overexaggerate the greatness of its characters as much as most historically films do (i.e. Gandhi, The Hurricane). Instead, it gave the character of William Wallace a sense of realism, a sense that he was human too, which really made his goals seem more important to the benefit of not only his people but to the concept of humanity itself.Braveheart doesn't have much complexity or any level of symbolic meaning to it. It's very simple and straight to the point. But it is done very artfully, both objectively and subjectively, as can be seen on the screen. Something like films used to be in the days when cinema was great as an art. Braveheart shows that movies can still achieve this goal of getting film done right. And all for the best, as Braveheart will definitely be remembered amongst those better films of our generation, and even amongst the better films of all time.

This film is amazing, maybe not the best picture ever made but definitely underrated, it's just one pleasant surprise after another. The script is razor sharp and the characters highly interesting, rare for films these days.The actors are also essential in carrying the film, and Nurse Betty has a great ensemble. We have Pruitt Taylor Vince and Crispin Glover as a pair of small town nitwits, Greg Kinnear as TV soap actor George McCord... And then we've got Chris Rock and Morgan Freeman as a couple of two-bit hit men. Rock has shown great promise in his live stand-up routines but until now he's never displayed any real magic, and then there's Freeman, talk about a change in direction, I've never seen him this intense, cursing up a storm, he may get a little too `Freemanesque' towards the end but for the most part he comes of as Samuel L. Jackson's cooler, meaner, older brother.But the real treasure here is Renée Zellweger as Betty, in the early days I thought she was annoying but with this and Bridget Jones she's really showing herself to be one of the best actresses around. There are times when we don't even recognise the performance because we are so wrapped up in the character of Betty. She conveys the loss and subtle fear of the character and her mishmash of emotions excellently and what a shame she didn't pick up any serious awards (I think she got a Golden Globe though) because this is one of the best performances you will see.LaBute does a good job with the material and the switches between light-hearted fantasy and molasses black humour are handled with expert precision. I haven't seen his previous films `In the Company of Men' or `You're Friends and Neighbours' but after this I might just check them out. But be warned, when I say pitch black comedy I mean it, Nurse Betty has some truly astounding moments but they all add up to the brilliance of the film, and even if the lead up to the ending becomes both tragic and farcical the actual ending is highly rewarding.Nurse Betty is a film that most might not be in any kind of rush to see, but I urge you to give it a try. It's a funny, sad, darkly comic and deeply serious film full of great characters, writing and direction.9\/10  ","genre":null},{"date":"6 October 2001","score":"","review":"  Wow, this film really blew me away, I'd seen clips of it when it was shown at Cannes last year but watching it I didn't know what to expect.

And a storyline can't get much weaker than this tale of a couple who are destined to be together.John Cusack and Kate Beckinsale meet cute in that temple of consumerism, Bloomingdale's,where both are Christmas shopping.  They spend a magical few hours together, including a spin around the ice rink in Central Park, and he immediately decides they should both dump their significant others and be blissfully happy together.  Of course, in an effort to give this thin story a little suspense, they don't.They both go back to the other people in their lives and spend the rest of the movie regretting that.They also spend the rest of the movie searching for one another. Much of the search lacks credibility.

But the real problem is, the hunt just isn't interesting.  In fact, virtually nothing in this movie is interesting.Cusack and Beckinsale have professions, but luckily, neither has to spend any time following them.

This movie seems designed for an egocentric, me generation audience that thinks the search for personal love,or at least a mate, is so important it is the only thing worth focusing on.  You can only wonder what happens if these two find each other, because if they are no more interesting than they seem to be during the search, they'll bore each other to death within weeks.John Cusack is okay in his role, but he's given so little to do that he seems totally wasted here. Beckinsale is certainly one of the most beautiful girls in movies today, a real movie star\/movie star.  And she can act.  She does a good job here with what little that she's given, coming off better than she did in Pearl Harbor.

What was Romero & King thinking? After being served up 5 wholesome stories in the first Creepshow, I was excepting a lot more from the sequel. At least 5 or 6 stories would have been perfect. Of course this would have made the budget a little bigger and we can't have that, now can we? In any case, Creepshow 2 offers 3 stories named Old Chief Woodenhead, The Hitchhiker & The Raft.  We start with Old Chief Woodenhead which centers around some punk Indian boys who rob a convenience store owner and kills him. What the boys aren't aware of is the wooden Indian statue outside the store. This thing comes to life to take revenge for the old man. The story is pretty lame. Yes, this is fictional horror, but this is ridiculous. There's nothing in the story that tells us WHY or HOW this statue comes to life. Did someone sprinkle pixie dust on it? Was it possessed by the old man? What gives?The second story, which seems to be everyones favorite, is The Raft.This was one of the creepiest tales I've ever seen. Even both versions of the Blob didn't creep me out as much. I think the key element that makes this story work in the music and sound effects. It's extremely creepy and keeps you senses on the edge as you wait to see what happens next. The story focuses on four teenagers who travel way, way out to a secluded lake to take a swim onto a bolted raft. The story never says WHY they would travel this far just for a swim in this lake. Apparently is was a favorite place of choice at one time. In the opening scene you seen them driving along a deserted road, so you know they aren't no where near any civilization. Once they get there, they strip down to their swim suits and head out to the raft, unaware of the black, stringy oil slick that's moving slowing toward them. This thing is HUGE, and I'm curious as to how deep the oil slick travels downward, as we are only shown the top of the water. As you can guess, this thing is alive and hungry. What happens next is pretty gruesome. Nuff said.The final story is called, The Hitchhiker and it's about a prostitute that cheats on her boyfriend and then travels home, but accidently hits a Hitchhiker on the way. Not wanting to stop because the boyfriend may find out she's been cheating or she may end up in jail for murder, she flees the scene only to encounter the Hitchhiker again and again and again. This story is pretty gruesome as you watch her run the Hitchhiker over and over again. Each times she sees him again, all the blood, broken bones, and disfigurement can be seen It's a bit funny at times as he continues to ask her for a ride every time she drives into him. The story isn't bad, but it's nothing special either. The ending it pretty much what you would expect.Overall, Creepshow 2 is a good rental. I'd say rent Creepshow  and Creepshow 2, but watch the second one first and then view the much better first one. Will there every be a Creepshow 3? At this point it doesn't look good. Steven King looks like a sick man these days and Romero is working on other projects. Maybe someone else will take the reigns and run with this one. We can only hope.

The story isn't bad, but it's nothing special either. The ending it pretty much what you would expect.Overall, Creepshow 2 is a good rental. I'd say rent Creepshow  and Creepshow 2, but watch the second one first and then view the much better first one. Will there every be a Creepshow 3? At this point it doesn't look good. Steven King looks like a sick man these days and Romero is working on other projects. Maybe someone else will take the reigns and run with this one. We can only hope.

What was Romero & King thinking? After being served up 5 wholesome stories in the first Creepshow, I was excepting a lot more from the sequel. At least 5 or 6 stories would have been perfect. Of course this would have made the budget a little bigger and we can't have that, now can we? In any case, Creepshow 2 offers 3 stories named Old Chief Woodenhead, The Hitchhiker & The Raft.  We start with Old Chief Woodenhead which centers around some punk Indian boys who rob a convenience store owner and kills him. What the boys aren't aware of is the wooden Indian statue outside the store. This thing comes to life to take revenge for the old man. The story is pretty lame. Yes, this is fictional horror, but this is ridiculous. There's nothing in the story that tells us WHY or HOW this statue comes to life. Did someone sprinkle pixie dust on it? Was it possessed by the old man? What gives?The second story, which seems to be everyones favorite, is The Raft.This was one of the creepiest tales I've ever seen. Even both versions of the Blob didn't creep me out as much. I think the key element that makes this story work in the music and sound effects. It's extremely creepy and keeps you senses on the edge as you wait to see what happens next. The story focuses on four teenagers who travel way, way out to a secluded lake to take a swim onto a bolted raft. The story never says WHY they would travel this far just for a swim in this lake. Apparently is was a favorite place of choice at one time. In the opening scene you seen them driving along a deserted road, so you know they aren't no where near any civilization. Once they get there, they strip down to their swim suits and head out to the raft, unaware of the black, stringy oil slick that's moving slowing toward them. This thing is HUGE, and I'm curious as to how deep the oil slick travels downward, as we are only shown the top of the water. As you can guess, this thing is alive and hungry. What happens next is pretty gruesome. Nuff said.The final story is called, The Hitchhiker and it's about a prostitute that cheats on her boyfriend and then travels home, but accidently hits a Hitchhiker on the way. Not wanting to stop because the boyfriend may find out she's been cheating or she may end up in jail for murder, she flees the scene only to encounter the Hitchhiker again and again and again. This story is pretty gruesome as you watch her run the Hitchhiker over and over again. Each times she sees him again, all the blood, broken bones, and disfigurement can be seen It's a bit funny at times as he continues to ask her for a ride every time she drives into him.

In fact, more than any American movie of recent times, this film captures the feel and essence of life as we really live it.  Heartfelt kudos go out to writer\/director Kenneth Lonergan for fashioning an intimate family drama that is totally devoid of both cheap sensationalism and phony melodramatics &#150; a drama in which no character is a hero or a villain but simply an ordinary human being struggling to come to grips with this messy thing we call life.  Set in a bucolic small town in rural New England, the film stars the luminous Laura Linney as Sammy Prescott, a single mother trying to instill in her eight-year old son a sense of decency and values.  Having lost their parents in a car crash at a very early age, Sammy and her siblings have obviously had to overcome any number of psychological and emotional obstacles on their way to adulthood &#150; and no one seems to have been as adversely affected by the tragedy as Sammy's younger brother, Terry, who, as an adult, has found himself drifting aimlessly from one location, job and relationship to another, completely lacking, as Sammy puts it, the `anchor' that holds most of our lives in place.  Sammy has found that anchor in the form of her son, her home, her church and her bank job, but when Terry suddenly returns for a visit and the bank hires a new, less-than-understanding manager (with whom she ends up having an affair), even Sammy discovers that the threads holding her own life together may be more tenuous and tangled than she originally imagined (she even discovers that her religion has begun to soft pedal sin at a time when she feels what she really needs is some good old-fashioned fire-and-brimstone exhortation).The beauty of Lonergan's screenplay is that, while it throws any number of curve balls our way and never lets us know for sure where the story is headed, at the same time, it achieves that most remarkable feat of never forcing us to question its credibility.  Every action and reaction on the part of the characters is completely in-line with life as we know it. In fact, each character in the film is a true-to-life, recognizable human figure, neither villainous nor saintly.  Sammy is an obviously well-intentioned young woman, a hardworking churchgoer who is just trying to raise her son to be the best person possible given the often trying circumstances brought on by single motherhood.  Sammy is also deeply devoted to her wayward brother, struggling to find a way to offer him the love and encouragement she feels he needs without jeopardizing the physical and psychological well-being of herself and her son, Rudy.  Yet, despite the innate goodness at the core of her being, Sammy, like all us mere mortals, stumbles morally from time to time &#150; most noticeably, in the unexpected affair she finds herself having with her new married boss (Matthew Broderick).  Suddenly, Sammy now has to cope with the paradoxical dilemma of trying to provide moral guidance for both her brother and her son, while she, herself, is violating the very foundation of her own code of ethics. Even more intriguing, perhaps, is the contradictory nature of Terry (played by Mark Ruffalo, who, I swear, sounds as if he had been dubbed by none other than John Travolta).  Here is a character who could so easily have slid over into the role of easy villain.  Instead, Lonergan has chosen to see him in three-dimensional terms, showing how many of his actions that wound and hurt those around him are the result far more of immaturity and a stunted emotional development than of outright greed, viciousness or malice.  Like a child, Terry seems unable to confront the root causes of his bitterness and anger, so he often takes out his frustration on people like Sammy and Rudy without thinking about the consequences until after he has performed the action.  Yet, there are any number of moments when Terry reaches out in a genuine way for love, forgiveness and understanding.  Because of the subtle duality of his nature, Terry is one of the most impressively realized characters I've seen in any film in a long, long time.Even the minor characters are expertly drawn.  As the philandering boss, Matthew Broderick makes us believe that much of his petty tyranny is really an attempt to hide the insecurity and unhappiness that is at the core of his personal life and being.  Even the almost comically tawdry affair that ensues between him and Sammy speaks volumes about the emptiness and confusion both of them feel deep inside.  Sammy's sometime boyfriend, Bob, seems almost too good to be true at times, but even he is struggling with his own demons of indecisiveness and insecurity.  The ultimate message of `You Can Count on Me' seems to be that, no matter how messed up our lives become, all we really have in the end is each other and that it is the duty of those of us who are coping the best to help bring along those near and dear to us who seem to be struggling the most.  In this instance, Kenneth Lonergan, by resisting the temptation to judge his characters or preach to his audience, has managed to create a film of great wisdom, perceptiveness and compassion.  It is truly a rare gem to be treasured.
