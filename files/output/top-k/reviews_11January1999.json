But I hated this film as I have not hated a film in a long time.  Having read the comments of the film's supporters, I get the impression that I'm just not smart enough or film-savvy enough to get the beauty of this film.  Sorry, kids, although I acknowledge that it was pretty to look at, I refuse to believe that the film's inaccessibility makes it great art.I found absolutely nothing to anchor me in tnis movie.  I turned to my companion 30 minutes into it and asked him, Did we miss the first reel?  I didn't have the first idea who the characters were.  When the captain tells some of his men after the big battle, you are like my sons I thought, who are these guys?  Was I supposed to know how he felt about them from his behavior or from any of the action of the film?  Because I didn't.  The whole scene came out of nowhere and went nowhere.  Take that one complaint and apply it to every character and every scene (except the climaxes of the various battles) and you have my experience of the film.I haven't read the book, but I did check out the reader comments on it in Amazon.com.  Apparently THE THIN RED LINE is a very gritty, realistic take on Guadalcanal told from multiple viewpoints of C-company's soldiers.  It would seem that this film is trying to be faithful the floating viewpoint, but I can hardly believe that the book's use of this device was as confusing as the movie's. Aside from not being able to distinguish one voice from another, my main problem is that the film kept an aesthetic distance from all of the characters so that when someone's voice-over was giving you his point of view it all melded together and seemed universally banal.  Doesn't the judicious use of specificity make the universal more meaningful?  Maybe the ultimate point of the film is that we will all end up dead and nothing matters, but I hardly think that boring me to death is the most effective way to make the point.I couldn't wait for this film to end.  It was all I could do to restrain myself from standing up in the theatre and screaming, Is anyone else here as bored as I am?  Weirdly enough, as much as I hate violence, I kept longing for some to relieve the tedium.I have sat through a 4 hour film about Mongolian women warriors (Johanna D'Arc of Mongolia) and loved it.

In the end I was very pleased with this movie rather unique capability to be equally interesting for the children as well as for the adults. On the children level the story is rather simple little polite orphan, pig Babe, lives happily on the farm with his various animal friends and a good master, does a valuable job and makes his master and all of his friends proud. Talking animals and singing mice are hardly an innovating idea, and this all sounds, more or less, like any other infantile children's cartoon that's interesting only if you're under 6. On the adult level things are rather different. It's a black comedy that raises serious questions. I cannot believe how many people describe this movie as magical or even innocent! From the beginning of the movie, when Babe thinks his mother and all of his brothers and sisters are going to Pig's heaven, as everyone says, when in fact they are taken to be slaughtered, move is full of such black humour, including Mrs. Hoggett calling Babe my little pork-chop, and farmer Hoggett wanting to kill Babe because he thinks that Babe is so much like a sheep dog that he could kill a sheep! And the fact that our beloved Christmas is a question of life or death for our little friend Babe, decision depending on this dilemma Pork-chops or duck d'orange? Don't you get the irony? Well, I haven't seen Babe PINC yet, but I intend to do so, as soon as it starts playing. And if it were darker than first Babe is, and everyone says so, I would think it's only natural. I mean, if idyllic life on the farm gave place for so much black humour, one can only imagine things that could happen in a big city.

Surprisingly enough it still doesn't bore me, though I have seen it over 450 times. Anthony-Michael Hall as the brain, showing why most brains in school are brains - mostly because of parental pressure. Emilio Estevez as the athlete shows us much the same thing. Most of us still excel in something because we're afraid of being a disappointment to our parents. Ally Sheedy not only looks her cutest (well, wargames excepted here), but portrays a basket case if I ever saw one.  She reminds me so much of a girl in my high school classroom it's unbelievable. Molly Ringwald as the stuck-up, self-righteous princess torn between her basically gentle character and her stuck-up friends and last, but certainly not least, Judd Nelson as the criminal. Abusive parents and all.This movie is a classic from beginning to end.  Dump 5 kids in a school library for a day and they WILL end up friends, even if it is just for that day.  In that lies the realism. Take a person away from his environment (be that the 'popular clique' or the 'bad kids' and they set all prejudice aside. This movie shows that no matter in what layer of society you are) everyone is essentially the same with the same problems. Sadly enough the truth is that although they end up friends, they will only be friends for that one day.Personally I think it's a shame that John Hughes went on to make crap like home alone..

The vibrant dialogue, the intertwined storylines and unexpected plot twists took me by surprise. I took my girlfriend(now ex-girlfriend) to see Pulp Fiction a few weeks later, and she didn't laugh at any of the funny parts, and definitely took exception to the violence. Of course we got in a big fight over the whole thing in the car ride home. I couldn't believe that anyone with half a liver and a thyroid as their only major organs, could not see the brilliance that Tarrantino had crafted.I watched Pulp Fiction for again since the last time I saw it with my ex, and you know what? I really didn't like it as much. Now much can be said about this reaction. Maybe my ears and eyes began to bleed with the post-Tarrantino melee of knock off culture that ensued after Pulp Fiction. Things that were already cool for twenty years, like Dick Dale, or Kool and the Gang got incessantly beat into our heads as the new hip thing. Fine, maybe I harbor a little resentment for how the mainstream will eventually water down anything that has any artistic merit. I think I even saw a butter commercial that used that Pulp Fiction font as title cards. Gimme a break.Back to the main point. Is Pulp Fiction a great movie? No. Is it good movie because it is entertaining? Yes. Is it an important movie? No. Do I think it isn't an entertaining movie because of the violence and profanity? Quite the contrary, I don't think that has anything to do with whether or not this movie is great or not. Pulp Fiction like myself, is a compost heap of pop-culture references. The Simpsons are a full of pop culture references yet considered great. Shakespeare is full of pop-culture references, but no one gives his work flak just because you have to open the OED to get half of it. I think too many people spend too much time dwelling on these obvious manifestations. I think the real reason Pulp Fiction is not great, is because it does nothing to create characters who are metaphoric in any sense. They are there to serve very one dimensional purposes on the screen. People praise Pulp Fiction for it's structural elements, but for my money Reservoir Dogs or a movie like Short Cuts did a better job of playing with narrative style. This brings me to Reservoir Dogs, which I think is a great and important movie because it did alter the narrative telling in a totally different way. Though much of the story element is ripped off from a similar chinese movie about twelves thieves with an informer and a heist gone bad(I can't remember the name of it), Tarrantino tells the story differently than any filmmaker has told before. Not only is the story non-linear, but if broken down into it's treatment of time, it looks like someone took a script chopped up into pieces, and then taped it back together randomly. Miraculously it all works. He also tells the story like a drama for the stage, with long extended dialogue sequences, but yet he manages to not get that why did they even bother putting on this film, because it looks exactly like a play look. (In the Company of Men, Oleanna) Reservoir Dogs has all the violence and profanity of Pulp Fiction, but it also has depth to it's characters.Tarrantino is a well educated filmmaker, in the sense that he knows his film history, and pays homage to great directors like Truffaut and Godard. Is Tarrantino a great director like them? No. In my mind he has made one truly great movie, and couple of good movies, and a couple of duds. Tarrantino might be totally screwed, as he might be scorned for the very style he invented, the next time he comes around the mountain. True no one does Tarrrantino better than he does himself, but do we really need or want it. Maybe that's why he's hanging out on broadway with Marisa Tomei, trying his shot at acting.
