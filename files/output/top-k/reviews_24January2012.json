Blade II has been sat nestled into my DVD collection for a few weeks now, so, I thought it was about time I put it on. Now I know the film was released in 2002 so I'm a little late to watching the sequel to Blade, a film I thoroughly enjoyed. I found that at first the obviously low-budget special effects started to put me off, but then realised being 2002, the graphics weren't going to rival James Cameron's Avatar and that I wasn't watching for CGI brilliance, but instead for a bit of an action thrill, and for this, Blade II didn't fail to deliver. Wesley Snipes bringing action fight-scene after fight-scene. Shortly into the film Blade is contacted to help the Bloodpack a group of vampires who have spent years training to defeat Blade. Each member of the Bloodpack fits a different action group stereotype, which when they meet the all have animosity towards Blade. The story following their meet and the plot twists throughout the film are nothing spectacular, but like the special effects, I don't always watch action films for the gripping story telling abilities. The only problem I truly found with Blade II was Norman Reedus's character Scud constantly playing on the cliché of his character as a the cocky stoner who spent the time since Whistler had been taken helping Blade out, and getting a little to proud of what he's been doing. Some of the gadgets he's created seem quite good but, he still doesn't take over the general bad-ass character that Kris Kristofferson portrays as Whistler. Altogether, I think if you've not seen Blade II you should defiantly think about giving it a watch.

The film really helped pave the way for the way we look at most horror and suspense films but also was an inspiration for video games like Dead Space, parts of Resident Evil. It's also a prime example of a remake when done the right way, don't get me wrong I like the 1950's film it's good in it's own way but I love the 80's version more because of just that being good in it's own way, a way I just like the most.There is so much I really love about this film, I love the creature effects from one of my favorite make up\/effect artists Rob Boltin as well as the late great Stan Winston. I liked seeing the dolperganger alien whenever it pops out it just seems to always transform into whatever the heck it's suppose to look like, it just seems to be a mixture of things, their slightly inspired by the monster from H.P. Lovecraft's stories which always had bizarre otherworldly monsters.I love the location it really sets up a atmosphere of fear and isolation. The music from Enccio Morone is excellent, it's one of my favorite horror scores ever, the theme song is memorable it just has that evokes the feeling of cold lonely fear. But most importantly it was in the suspense which is the best thing and a common thing with Carpenter.You are just on red alert throughout the whole film, because the danger doesn't let up even in it's peaceful moments. I actually jumped a few times watching this movie and that was a great feeling that I don't get often. Like that infamous blood test scene, I was at edge having both anticipation on who the Thing is but at the same time scared of the possibility of the Thing. You really feel just that sense of paranoia. From the enviorment which feels palpable, just the cold, darkness, and sheer isolation knowledge that these people are in the middle of nowhere and there is no one out there to help because their miles away. There is also the fact that no one can really run or even hide, because you really can't get out of the facility there is nothing out in that envorment to run to, you'll freeze to death in mere minutes. And due to the Thing being anyone along with how small the facility is it leaves few places to really hide. So it leaves you with that sense of doom and dread because of the lack of those options.It's true these characters don't have much depth and you don't get to really know most of them despite some personality on them but that's the point. Even though these characters all live under the same roof you can see their all not really close, and it just goes to show that just because your in the same enviorment doesn't automatically mean all will be friends, it's like with the high school and collage I've been to there are hundreds or almost thousands of people that I pass by or go to class with and barely know a mere fraction of them.Though a couple of characters stand out for me mainly MacReady and Childs played by two favorite actors of mine Kurt Rusell and Keith David. Both just have some of the best lines and both are proactive in the situation, I like how both are scared but their don't wimp out against danger they fight back, let alone that really is the only option available. Let alone both are likable and easy to emphasize with a bit because both are bored and just want to get the heck out of the facility. I don't blame them, I might just go nuts being there to long without a anime convention or girl around that can really suck.The Thing itself it an enigma, we don't really know it's motives or if it even has any. Nor does it seem to have really a true form since it can replicate itself by being viral. I even like how it behaves which makes it feel all the more real, despite primal it's capable of intelligence it was able to fly and tried to rebuild it's spacecraft after all. It's also kinda like a game hunter, the Thing doesn't really do anything at first but you know it will once it's moment comes, the humans it imitates are practically it's camouflage which is it's edge, and what makes it a hard opponent to nail. Did the Thing come from another planet we haven't discovered or may'be another galaxy. Was the alien suppose to be some kinda scout for invasion of Earth or could it of been some sort of bio weapon some alien race created to help destroy Earth's inhabitants. I don't know your theories are as good as mine, but that makes the creature all the more scary.This film was an acknowledgment of cold war paranoia as well as paranoia of disease in the 80's decade but I also feel it's relevant today with our decade with our war on terrorism and chemical weapons\/disease epidemics. The main theme is about distrust of our fellow man, how it is not the enemy seen that will destroy people but it is fear of the stranger that becomes our undoing.It's not the enemy that you see that should be fear, it is the enemy unseen.Rating 4 stars ","genre":null},{"date":"24 January 2012","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Trust has became a scarce commodity, because of the simple fact we never really know a person, because in reality it's impossible to know a person fully, there is just always something to hide.This film is my favorite film from my favorite movie director John Carpenter as well as my favorite horror film and favorite films in general.

And their agents were right! Good thing Kevin Bacon wasn't in this flick, or that famous game would be ruined because it'd be too easy. Not only were the big names present, but they were also performing their asses off. Whether they were nailing a tagline, cheesing a smug smile, conveying emotion through a subtle non-verbal cue, or purposefully over-acting, these actors brilliantly nailed their roles, and brought a great script to life. One scene involving Pam Grier, Ray J, Brandon Hammond, and a bus had me cracking up and cheering, in particular. By the way, I usually do not find Parker attractive, but I gotta admit she was pretty friggin' smokin' in this movie&#x85;not hotter than Christina Applegate, though, whom I only recognized after staring at the screen and wondering, Who is that fine-ass chick?And let's not forget the one area of this movie in which I expected Burton to deliver most the aliens. Well, Burton came through even better than expected. The CGI was creative, scary, repulsive, ridiculous, and funny. At one point, I wondered whether it was treason to cheer for the aliens.Honestly, I think I didn't rate this flick higher only because I'm not a big fan of the science-fiction genre, so I probably wouldn't watch it more than once, but if you're a science-fiction lover, you might consider this movie a must-own. I definitely think everyone should make the time to watch it at least once, though.

Well, Burton came through even better than expected. The CGI was creative, scary, repulsive, ridiculous, and funny. At one point, I wondered whether it was treason to cheer for the aliens.Honestly, I think I didn't rate this flick higher only because I'm not a big fan of the science-fiction genre, so I probably wouldn't watch it more than once, but if you're a science-fiction lover, you might consider this movie a must-own. I definitely think everyone should make the time to watch it at least once, though.

With his size and his deep voice (and, of course, his background as Herman Munster!) he is a perfect choice to have a role in this kind of movie. Just by his presence (even though he's playing a nice guy) he brings a sense of ominousness to the story. Unfortunately, Fred Gwynne was about the only thing I found here that I did like about this movie. I've watched a lot of the adaptations of Stephen King stories over the years, and most of them I've quite liked. This would have to rank as the weakest I've seen. Aside from Gwynne, the cast (mostly headed by Dale Midkiff and Denise Crosby as Louis and Rachel Creed along with Gwynne as Judd, their new neighbour) didn't grab me.As the movie begins the Creeds have just moved to a new home, which is located right beside a road filled with speeding trucks all day and night. Judd is their neighbour across the road. Judd shows them around, pointing out a path that leads to a pet cemetery where animals killed by the trucks have been buried. When the Creeds' cat is killed, Judd takes Louis beyond the pet cemetery to an old Micmac burial ground, where those who are buried come back to life - but not quite as they were. Church the cat comes back to life, but as a meaner, more vicious cat. Tragedy then strikes, when the Creeds' young son Gage is killed by a truck, and Dale comes up with the idea of burying Gage's body in the Micmac ground, in spite of a warning from Judd about what could happen. Gage comes back to life too - but not as the sweet, lovable little boy the Creeds knew.The story moved slowly, with really very little of sustained interest or excitement. The main problem is that the basic story was clearly given away by Judd as he told Louis stories about what had happened in the past when animals or people had been buried in the hallowed Micmac ground. What was the point of the flashbacks? I mean, once you know that it has happened, you're pretty sure that it's going to happen again. Perhaps 5 minutes of flashbacks served as a spoiler to the entire movie. Yes, there are a few standard thrills and chills here and there, but nothing really frightening. I wasn't really clear what the point of Rachel's childhood memories of her sick sister was, or why it was necessary for Louis to have such a horrible relationship with Rachel's parents. The kid who keeps coming back from the dead (as a ghost?) to speak to Rachel or her daughter Ellie also struck me as unnecessary. In fact, most of this movie actually struck me as unimportant filler, leading up to an ending that was really quite silly.
