The first Mission film was really well done, with DePalma recreating the stealthy spy type feel of the series. There will not be a better nail-biter than the highwire segment in the first.When I saw that John Woo was going to direct #2, I was psyched! I had visions of Faceoff dancing through my head, eager to see two hours of hard-core, non-stop action. Here's where you should take heed. The action scenes are few and far between and most of the stuff they do seems like deja vu from dozens of older films. The first Mission, cited as too complicated, made the writers come up with a cliche and grade school simple storyline of an agent gone bad how many times have we seen this?whose only schtick is a Scottish accent, who plans on wiping out the world with a virus.It took a good hour before any real action hit the screen, and most of it was like a rehash of Faceoff. Anthony Hopkins was HORRENDOUSLY under-used, and Ving Rhames, who is a terrific actor, gets stuck sitting in a van the whole film, mashing away on a keyboard.The implausability factor is from Cruise though. In the first film, he was a clean-cut, by the book agent with a nice mix of daredevil and intelligence. In this one, he is a mix of Shaggy from Scooby-Doo and some horrible Van Damme wanna-be. Part of what made this film ridiculous was Cruise suddenly bouncing around like a kung-fu master!? The one scene where I laughed out loud was the start of the bike chase. After dispatching a bunch of guys, he runs over to a bike and then STOPS AND PUTS ON HIS SUNGLASSES!?!? How STUPID is that!?All in all, if you want to see this film, watch the trailer. All the action is shown there. If you really want to fork out $5 and sit through 2 hours of this drivel, just don't say I didn't warn you. This review will self destruct in 5 seconds....It's just a shame the movie won't!

The plot, unfairly maligned by many with limited attention spans, was intriguing, with surprising twists. I think it was one of the best films of its type.MI 2, on the other hand, is a dull, plodding affair with little suspense. Everything seems recycled and unoriginal -- a bit of Notorious, a bit of To Catch a Thief, a bit of James Bond, all mixed in a base of Hong Kong kung fu movies. There is nothing you haven't seen before (and done better). It depresses me that some actually prefer this dumbed down version of MissionImpossible to the much-superior first movie in the series.The camera work is cliched, with John Woo repeating himself (in slow motion, of course). The script, what there is of it, is quite poor, and Woo (who did much better work in Face\/Off) gets performances from his actors to match. Cruise is Cruise, and the rest of actors are either ill-used or turn in hammy performances. Anthony Hopkins tries what he can with his few minutes of screen time, but unfortunately it's all made up of worthless speeches with no interaction to speak of. He's essentially a variation of M in the Bond series and little more.Although I've never had any problem suspending disbelief at the movies, this one goes too far in having us check our brains at the door. The face mask trick is overdone and entirely unconvincing as used here. The bike chase at the end, which seems to be getting the most praise, is hard to enjoy because it is so wildly unrealistic and not much more than a series of stunts strung together.All in all, I can only hope that this is a low point in the MissionImpossible series and that the franchise will return to the level established by the first movie in the next one.

It felt like it was trying to be many things that is just quite couldn't.  And more important to the detriment of the film, I kept saying things to myself during the film.  Things like, The fight scenes were good, but they were better in The Matrix,  The choreography of the action scenes was OK, but they were more intense in Face\/Off,  or The gadgets were neat, but they were cooler in James Bond.  One more thing I couldn't get out of my head - and don't take this the wrong way - was How did they get Tom Cruise's hair to be all silky and wavy when he flips around like that?  Actually, I think Cruise got paid $25 million, and his hair must've got another $5 million at least, for all the acting it did.  The movie was enjoyable, don't get me wrong, but it lacked the *escapist* element.  The female lead, Thandie Newton, was terrific in her role as the thief turned spy.  And she almost had more emotion as Tom's Hair.  Um, that's supposed to be a compliment.  But it brings up another problem.  All the other actors seemed a bit under used.  Ving Rhames, at the time of the first movie, was on the verge of becoming a major African American film star.  What with his great performances in Pulp Fiction, Dave, and Out of Sight, you'd think he'd have a bigger role this time around.  But if anything, it was less memorable than the Hair.  (I'm sorry, that's really the biggest thing I remember about the movie now, 5 hours after seeing it.) And where did the other member of the IMF team come from, and what was his purpose?  My point being simply that the characters were very under used. Oh!  There's another thing.  The bad guy.  No, I didn't have a particular problem with Dougray Scott, he was supposed to look like Cruise.  But his henchman rubbed me the wrong way.  Mr. Stamp (a bit too close to Tomorrow Never Dies' Mr. Stamper) couldn't decide whether he was an intelligent killer, or a bad-a** thug.  I would have preferred the former, and liked to have seen Thomas Jane from Deep Blue Sea in that role.  He makes a really good brooding bad guy.  Another major part of the under used list was Anthony Hopkins.  He made a passable IMF leader, but he didn't look like he was enjoying himself very much.Ok, it was worth seeing, definitely.  I just think it should have concentrated more on the action than the romance, or the other way around.One last note. As a would-be filmmaker, I had to notice the over-use of the suddenly very popular slo-mo shot.  It was just short of annoying.  Let's hope for a return to more traditional film styles, instead of the so-different-it's-cool motif we're seeing so much of lately.

Four teens are out for an evening of fun at a carnival and they end up paying for it with their lives.  It is a great idea to have two guys and two girls spend the night in a funhouse but the execution of it is quite banal.  And that is too bad because it had all the ingredients to be quite scary.What is good about the film is the opening which pragmatically tips it's cap to Carpenter's opening shot in Halloween.  It is a nice touch to see a Halloween mask put over the camera as a little boy, heavy breathing and all, walks slowly into the bathroom where his sister is taking a shower and then pretends to stab her with a plastic knife.  The other decent part in the film is when the first guy dies, he is then hit in the head with an axe by one of his friends.  They thought he was the killer coming around a dark corner and they split his head open with an axe.  These two parts were very well done.  The rest of the film is not.The killing doesn't even start until almost an hour into the film.  And that is fine if the movie and the screenplay in particular would have done a better job of setting it up.  But all we get is some inane scenes of the kids going on carnival rides and smooching.  Nothing forbidden is even remotely mentioned about the funhouse except that a couple of years ago a couple of kids were found dead in a funhouse a few states over.  But then they leave it alone.  I wanted to know more about this funhouse a few states over.  How did the kids die?  Was there a suspect?  Was anyone indicted in the murders?  There was nothing to make me afraid for the kids to enter that house.  And that is where the film fails.  Sure the killer is deformed and ugly and blah blah blah but even he isn't that scary.Funhouse is a disappointment but Hooper is to be forgiven.  He directed TCM and Poltergeist and that is a good enough track record to be exonerated from any wrong doing with this film.4 out of 10**** Just a side note.  Has anyone ever given any thought to Hooper being somewhat of an animal rights activist?  I have.  In Texas Chainsaw Massacre, there was great detail not only verbally but visually to the slaughter of animals.  And this one had a carnival full of deformed animals on display for everyone to gawk at.  I can't put my finger on it but there has to be some sort of connection there.  If anyone else has any theories, please email me.  And if that is the case, then kudos to you Mr. Hooper.

Spielberg struck out with Hook, Stone with U-Turn and Hooper was out to lunch with this poor effort.  Funhouse takes a typical premise but does nothing with it.  Four teens are out for an evening of fun at a carnival and they end up paying for it with their lives.  It is a great idea to have two guys and two girls spend the night in a funhouse but the execution of it is quite banal.  And that is too bad because it had all the ingredients to be quite scary.What is good about the film is the opening which pragmatically tips it's cap to Carpenter's opening shot in Halloween.  It is a nice touch to see a Halloween mask put over the camera as a little boy, heavy breathing and all, walks slowly into the bathroom where his sister is taking a shower and then pretends to stab her with a plastic knife.  The other decent part in the film is when the first guy dies, he is then hit in the head with an axe by one of his friends.  They thought he was the killer coming around a dark corner and they split his head open with an axe.  These two parts were very well done.  The rest of the film is not.The killing doesn't even start until almost an hour into the film.  And that is fine if the movie and the screenplay in particular would have done a better job of setting it up.  But all we get is some inane scenes of the kids going on carnival rides and smooching.

And how about that sub-plot of love (or was it?) between Maximus and the Emperor sister, it should have been developed.. and he should have escaped Rome and bring back the army too late to save his new lover.. QUIT IT ALREADY WHERE ROMEO ALWAYS HAS TO DIE. Juliette can die too, it would be less predictable sometime.. or even better they both live to see the next day.. no need for sweet thereafters. The main character had his share of tragedies, no need to make it a Voltaire rip-off.War, I assume is some sort of hell, but your head is not shaking live a damn arkinson sick patient. Even the glorious fights and armies cannot make me forget that it's all a big hoax, half the military unit seen in the movie did not exist at the depicted time.. I am sorry, but I'd like to believe that when millions are spent on a movie, and with the constant rising of ticket price, the writers are spending some time to make sure of some chronoligical accuracy.I give this movie 47% (5\/10)P.S. Was the emperor sister pretty or what?

The real story starts when a huge black man, John Coffey comes in, who much later in the film turns out to be able to heal people in a mysterious way. We also get acquainted with the other prisoners and wards. One of the wards is not as nice as the others, but a frustrated sadist. The story is well told with great eye for detail, also the actors, with Tom Hanks as main character are giving excellent performances. The film loses (great part) of its' credibility when John Coffey starts working his miracles. It is not very clear why we need to see not one, not two, but THREE electrocutions(of which one goes wrong and never seems to end).But what is mainly disturbing about this film is not so much its' length or the unnecessary flashback (why not start right away with the story?), but the portrayal of its charachters. The film seems to be trying to tell us, that we should be nice to all, no matter what or who, not be racist, but it does it in a very stereotypical and disturbing way, and thus sending the opposite message. As Hall already once argued, a representation of, for example violence, is not violence, but a message about violence. The huge, muscled black guy, is really a softy who is hardly able to pronounce grammarly correct sentences. It is very surprising nobody protested against this terrible stereotype, which I supposed has been overcome and  belonged to the past, where blacks were thought simple and stupid.

It very much depends on the movie of course and in quite some cases it doesn't matter, but sometimes it does.Anyway, I decided to watch this movie, which I knew absolutely nothing about. The movie is set in England. The scenery looks grey and drab. You can almost touch the isolation... I myself would feel totally miserable there. There is an instant compelling atmosphere in the movie. The scenery, though drab, looks gorgeous and the music's beautiful. As soon as the first conversation starts I know I'm gonna miss my subtitles very much. Especially the heavy British accent from Ray Winstone is barely intelligible, for me that is. So it was kind of a waste to watch the movie this way and I was thinking of stopping it. But... I couldn't find a moment to do so, coz the movie was too spellbinding to break up...Well, I won't say more about the plot, coz I'd advice anyone to see it without any knowledge in advance.

It's a drama that works on all levels. It's a very uncomfortable movie which is hard to watch and features some of the most disturbing scenes I've seen. It's an excellent movie though that got me emotionally very involved. The performances are superb too. Especially Lara Belmont, in a debut performance (!), was amazing. She gives the runner up best performance by a female of last year (Hilary Swank being number 1). There's one scene in which she's crying which is so devastating, it's unbelievable someone is capable of showing such emotions. This girl has some talent, I tell ya.The language problem I mentioned was no problem in the end. Of course I missed some lines here and there, but this movie features images that tell more than a thousand words.I give this movie an 9.0 and add it to my Top 10 movies for 1999, a truly incredible year for movies, this movie being one of its most memorable ones.

The opening sequence was fantastic! The cinematography, mainly in the first few minutes of the movie, but throughout the entire length of the movie was wondrous. Yet, the story went from interesting and inviting to plain stupid. At first I thought this movie would be a direct remake of The Fall Of The Roman Empire, but unfortunately it was not. Somewhere along the line, this movie lost its balance. I think it happened at the point where Maximus leaves Germania in search of his family. It seemed as if the director of this movie tried to take elements from Conan the Barbarian and Spartacus, and incorporate them with the main story from The Fall Of The Roman Empire. The fight scenes were astonishing, though too many special effects were used in this movie...at certain moments in the movie I felt like if I was watching The Phantom Menace--ugh! All those things contributed to making this movie a mess. However, I would surely recommend this movie to others. Although this movie is more than two hours long, it's not boring.

He's the next big thing--everyone else move over. He's got the talent, the looks, and the presence to become a movie STAR. Also, I liked seeing the great Richard Harris as the emperor, Marcus Aurelius. Furthermore, I was impressed by Connie Nielsen. At first I thought, why cast a Danish actress in a role that could easily be played by an American or British actress? But she really did a fine job in this movie. In addition, I liked the costumes, though they were too unrealistic, but they were striking. On the other hand, so much money was spent on special effects to show how wonderful ancient Rome was; yet in the entire movie, you only get to see a couple of minutes of shots of the city. Also, Joaquin Phoenix's acting was terrible, though he does have the look of a villain....maybe when he's older he'll make a better villain in a movie. While the ending was very similar to the ending in Braveheart, I feel that toward the end, this movie redeemed itself. The last twenty or so minutes of this movie were pretty good.

People are so hung up on the sillyness of it, but get a clue, that is what movie musicals are all about. Look at every Elvis movie and look at Grease for goodness sake. A true classic and its really building a following nowadays. Grease.....it's still the word. The Music and Feeling Go on Forever. Pinks and Birds for ever!

Wes Craven has worked his magic in this top-notch thriller, which stars a top-rate cast. Though the plot is nothing new, it is the way that Craven crafts it which makes it so good.The best thing about Scream 3 that I liked was the fact that there were no clues given to the identity of the killer. Some people like to play detective along with the movie; I am one of those people and I hate when the director reveals the villain early. It takes the fun out of the movie when this happens.When it came time to unmask the villain, it was a complete and pleasant shock because Craven completely fooled me as to who the killer was.Another thing I liked about this film was that it introduced new horror sequences with better action and special effects. The dialogue in Scream 3 seemed unrehearsed and natural. and unlike other films it also seemed like the cast had a blast with one another while in production of making Scream 3.From beginning to end, Scream 3 was a brilliant work of art by the horror master, Craven. Craven really knew what he was doing when he was directing this film.I give this film two thumbs way up and my recommendation to anyone who is a horror or movie fan; it is that great.

I really shouldn't like this movie since it's aimed squarely at kids. But to my astonishment I did. It's no classic to be sure. It's mostly ridiculous. It's absurd in many ways. However for some odd reason, it entertained me. The thing I liked best about the movie is the six young actors who play the Power Rangers. They're all good, although I wish the screenplay would have let their characters delelop better that it did. Then this movie would have been better. I wish this movie, as well as the TV show, could have been aimed at teenagers instead of kids. Then some of it wouldn't be so juvenile. However, this movie is nowhere near as childish as the terrible second movie Turbo A Power Rangers Movie.  One good thing about Mighty Morphin Power Rangers The Movie is that you don't see much of two of the most brainless characters in the history of show business, Bulk and Skull. Cut those guys out! The six actors who play the rangers (Karan Ashley, Johnny Yong Bosch, Steve Cardenas, Jason David Frank, Amy Jo Johnson, and David Yost) give far better performances compared to the two actors who play those goofballs (Jason Narvy and Paul Schrier) in this movie and on the TV show. Of all of these actors, only Johnson has gone on to some fame (on TV's Felicity). Mighty Morphin Power Rangers The Movie has better special effects than on the show and in Turbo, and that helps alot. This is one odd picture. It ain't all that good, but it's not all that bad either. **1\/2 (out of four) ","genre":null},{"date":"29 May 2000","score":"23 out of 31 people found the following review useful","review":"  I hate to admit this, but Mighty Morphin Power Rangers The Movie is one of my major guilty pleasures.
