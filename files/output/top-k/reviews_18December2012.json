The relationship between Kevin Costner and Elijah Wood is just wonderful. The film deals with a lot of social issues such as the cause of war and the aftermath of it, failure in life, classism and poverty lines, racism and dealing with death. Family is a strong theme in this movie. Kevin Costner plays Stephen Simmons, a returning Vietnam vet who seeks to build a better life for his wife and children in 1970's Mississippi. Costner is great as the tortured soul trying to teach his young son the value of lessons he had learned during the war. There is a bit of Atticus Finch in his performance that mirrors Gregory Peck. Kevin Costner is brimming with positive lessons on social consciousness, but struggles to be a breadwinner for his family due to post-traumatic stress disorder from his service in the Vietnam War. While this is going on, Simmons children, Stu (Elijah Wood) and Lidia (Lexi Randall) are feuding with an even poorer family of neighbors, the Lipnickis, over access to a tree fort that Stu and Lidia built. Elijah Wood is not bound to his cuteness which is proved very well by his performance here and in numerous other movies as well. Elijah was such a great child actor here. No one like him these days as far as child actors, he just had that natural passion that exudes when he performed. This young man has his own battles and demons to face in an ongoing feud with a family of roughnecks and bullies. The talk between him and Kevin Costner are amazing. There are countless scenes which a parent can take out to teach their children about life lessons. One example would be the 'cotton candy' scene. Lidia is a smart girl whose imagination is fully developed. She processes her experiences and her father's wisdom in an essay that celebrates love, courage, and caring. She sports a great narrator. There is a sub-plot in the film dealing with Lindia in summer school dealing with an over the top racist teacher. Christine Baranski played the racist teacher, but her performance is so cartoony, but without her. We wouldn't have one of the best scenes in the film. The only other noticeable supporting child character would be Elvadine (LaToya Chisholm) and this is where she shines. Elvadine did a fabulous job on her monologue, but it is the last few seconds that gets me. I thought Elvadine's speech and cadence, gave such a great performance for an actress so young. Elvadeen is a hoot. While this story defers the movie from its main story-arch, it's a brilliant stand-alone plot line. The Linicki's children are brutal. The amount of child to child violence might alarm some parents. That's how mean people are. They thrive on making others feel bad so they can feel better about themselves. Seeing how the Lipnicki's father is, you understand why. I think the one thing the Lipnicki kids were jealous of was that Stu and Lydia had a father that couldn't give them much, but he gave them his love unconditionally. The Simmons and Linickis are fighting against each other over a tree fort. It's serves as a MacGuffin, protagonist and antagonist willing to do and sacrifice almost anything to pursue, protect or control, often with little or no narrative explanation as to why it is considered so important. It's represent how much people are willing to battle each other, over something so simple. The gut- wrenching whole story is amazing, sad but true that bad things happen to the good people. Pretty much shows how unfair life really is. Still it's the richest, most realistic and revealing story ever made about the moral challenges of parenting. The lyrical and spiritually resonant screenplay by Kathy McWorter presents the engaging portrait of a father who, through bad times as well as good ones, shares with his son and daughter the ideals he believes give life meaning and purpose. In addition, his compassionate deeds create a legacy that goes beyond wealth or words. This whole movie is great it really makes me realize the things I take for granted. I will definitely recommend this movie to friends. Fabulously written and portrayed scene from a very much underrated movie. Oscar worthy performances from the predominantly child cast. The music is great as well. Thomas Newman never fails to impress, capturing that emotional feel in every movie he composes and love hearing those 1960's pop hits. Parents are often hard-pressed in the midst of dealing with life's unrelenting problems to find the right time and the right words to pass on to their children the values they cherish. It's nice to see a movie that deals with teaching the children about morality.

I saw this movie for the first time in high school, and I've always just been drawn to it for some reason. Actually, the first time I saw it, I was really confused, but I still loved this movie. At the time, I never watched a movie like it. The subtle comedy was something I never saw before, the story through a lot of curve balls my way, and it's somewhat depressing; but this movie just has this hypnotic effect on me. Now that I'm older, I can see why I love this movie so much. I'm Benjamin Braddock. Never before have I related to a movie character so much. If you want to know what I was like in high school, just watch Dustin Hoffman's performance in this movie. I know exactly what he's going through. Feeling alone as the future approaches faster and faster, hoping all the answers will come fast and easy, making decisions without thinking of the consequences, and having a new outlook on life; this character is so identifiable, that it's scary. I also love the music and the cinematography. They complement each other perfectly. They really enhance the mood of the film, and make it feel so much more real. The movie also has a lot of awkward moments. I've seen this movie so many times, but no matter how many times I see it, those awkward moments are still just as uncomfortable. And why shouldn't they be? The film deals with a very heavy, very real, and very uncomfortable subject, so those scenes are very necessary. The scenes may be awkward, but hey, so is life. It's a great movie, and I really can't think of another movie like it. It has a great, subtle, dark sense of humor; it has very heavy emotions, the main character is great, the side characters are great as well, and it takes a lot of risks. It's another one of those movies from the late 60s that definitely broke new ground, and paved the way for modern day cinema.

It has a cheesy, lighthearted tone to it, but it also broke new grounds for the modern age of cinema. Before this, movies about race were much darker. You had The Intruder (1962), To Kill a Mockingbird (1962), and In the Heat of the Night (1967); which are all amazing movies, but a little dark for the everyday moviegoer. Guess Who's Coming to Dinner deals with the issue of race, but it does it in a way that isn't intimidating, and it doesn't force the message on the audience. It's a lovable movie, and it has an amazing cast. Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn are amazing as the parents. These are two of my favorite actors of all time, and just like Bringing Up Baby, there's just a grand presence to seeing two legends work off each other. Sidney Poitier is perfect as the daughter's boyfriend; and I love how he's portrayed as the perfect man, but at the same time, he has that I can explain look for most of the movie. Katharine Houghton is amazing as the daughter. She's so energized, and so naive that it's hard not to love this character. One thing I really like about this movie is how race neutral it is. The parents aren't racist, they're just afraid of how their children will be treated in society; which is something I think a lot of people at the time can relate to. The times were changing, and this was the perfect movie to address this issue. It's funny, it's dramatic, it's touching, and it's smart; it's just an all around great movie. It may be corny to some people, but to me, it's a timeless movie that still holds up to this day.

Had I seen Office Space first I would have been tempted to avoid Swingers for fear that the lead was a horrible actor. However the truth is that the script for Office Space is at times awful (particularly in the last twenty minutes when the big moments between the two leads arrive). Aniston and Livingston come across very poorly and it really isn't their fault.I suspect Office Space is a grower. Milton no doubt becomes even funnier the more you see him and other subtleties of humour will shine through. The mind will adjust to the clunky script and accept that these are not, and never could be, real conversations. First impressions are though that Mike Judge is far more adept at the shorter game, even if he does bring enough splashes of brilliance to edge a thumbs up.

Santa Claus is getting older and is forgetting such important things like who's naughty, and who's nice, and who asked a toy truck, etc. These of course are very important things for Santa to have stored in his memory. So in order to keep Christmas going at a rapid pace, Santa sets his sights on Joe Carruthers (a children's ) to take over the very important job. Problem is that Joe is so busy with his acting career that each time Santa tries to tell him about the gig, he either leaves in a rush thanks to his money hungry agent, or doesn't believe that what Santa is saying is real. That's where Ernest and a runaway teenage girl named Harmony come into play. They go on a journey with Santa to make Joe the new Santa Claus thereby saving Christmas.I really enjoyed this Ernest film. It isn't as dumb and pointless as some of the other Ernest films done before and after, it has a really nice message and is a heart warming Christmas movie. Jim Varney does his usual Ernest part to perfection and I really liked the dynamic between him, Noelle Parker (Harmony) and Douglas Seale (Santa Claus). You can see that they really believe in Santa eventually and come to care about him and saving Christmas. There are some laughs in this as well, I always loved when Ernest would dress up as the old woman with the wig and neck brace. Pretty solid comedic moments in this one for sureI highly recommend anyone looking for a good Christmas movie to see 'Ernest Saves Christmas'. Douglas Seale may be the most realistic Santa Claus I've seen in more recent Christmas movies. He has a classic look to him in this film that I love, it adds to the story wonderfully.

It was a great story, full of great characters and superb directing and acting. I'll also straighten this out. The reason that I didn't love the film wasn't because of the fact that it didn't have enough action\/horror moments but because of the tone throughout the movie.What I mean by that is, most of the film feels a bit too quiet for my liking. It took me forever to get into the film, because of the excruciatingly slow start. It wasn't because there wasn't any kill or anything like that but the story didn't start off very interesting. I would've liked the start more if they simply started with a couple of people saying a couple of jokes or something similar. It took me over 45 minutes to get into this film, however from that point on I did not stop until the film was over. After that point, I loved the film a lot.I really came to enjoy the characters during the film and strangely found myself mainly fascinated by Ash. I'm not sure if this was because he was played by Ian Holm, and he was in Lord of the Rings, but I loved his character. The character twist for him absolutely shocked me and I loved it. I also loved Ripley played by Sigourney Weaver and also liked Parker a lot. One character I actually didn't like was Lambert and she was quite a let down for me. I found her annoying for some reason. Apart from her, I loved every other character.The Special effects for this film are amazing for its time. It was made in 1979 and much like the original Star Wars, the special effects exceed its time period! The film didn't actually capture the creepiness that I expected it to capture, but the story was great, the characters were great and the execution was brilliant.

He's made some of the greatest, thought provoking, controversial films of all time, and his style is out of this world. But before The Shining, before A Clockwork Orange, before 2001, before Dr. Strangelove, even before Spartacus, there was The Killing. It's a very good movie, but it's not one of Kubrick's best; and I was sort of expecting that. Rarely is a director's first movie his best, and even though it has some flaws, it's still a great movie. One problem I have with this movie is the unnecessary narration. I know that wasn't Kubrick's idea, but it's bad, and it's noticeable. It's actually pretty insulting to the audience's intelligence. I think Kubrick trusted his audience to be smart enough to follow the film, and I wish they would just remove it from the film. Another thing is that the movie feels very lopsided. The first half isn't bad, but the second half is definitely stronger. We get a lot of dialogue for the first half, and then we see the action in the second half. It's very well written, and it does keep my interest, but the scale is totally tipped. It's similar to Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill movies. The first movie is non-stop action and wildly entertaining, and the second movie has very minimal action, and is mostly talking. Like I said, I love dialogue (especially when it's well written), but I wish it was more balanced with the action. So what's good about this movie? Well, the characters are great. You can tell Tarantino took a lot of inspiration from this movie when he made Reservoir Dogs. It's one of the first instances where the main characters are bad guys, they're very mean spirited, but you cheer for them anyway. Also, the ending is unique for the time. Just like I Am a Fugitive From a Chain Gang, the ending is just very haunting, and leaves you with a dark feeling. I think the best thing about this movie is the cinematography. Kubrick is known for his incredible cinematography, and it's really cool to see where it all started. You can just see the future genius that lies within. The Killing isn't a perfect movie, but it's still really good. For a low budget crime drama from the 1950s, it's amazing. And even though it's so low budget, you can still see that Kubrick style slowly growing. It may not be one of his best, and it does have its flaws, but it's still an engaging, dark, intelligent movie.

Colonel Dax, aware of the men's innocence, chooses to act as their lawyer.There are four scenes\/sequences in particular I would like to mention the first is the sequence in which the camera does a tracking shot, following Colonel Dax (Kirk Douglas) through a trench which is being bombarded by the Germans.

Because of my lack of love for the book, I'd never seen any adaptations of Mansfield Park, and was specially glad to stay away from this one, so hated by my fellow Austen fans.I decided to see it this week for truly shallow reasons I discovered Jonny Lee Miller was in it, and I think he's really hot, especially in this phase of his life (great actor also). So I watched it, and surprisingly, really liked it! I completely understand why fans of the book hate it, if one of the other five Austen books were changed to this extent I would have a fit. Fanny is a completely different character, though a much more interesting one in my opinion. The outrage fans showed over the slavery storyline is specially understandable, it's such a jarring storyline to insert, not to mention it makes Fanny into such a Mary Sue in her I'm ahead of my contemporaries in understanding that slavery &#x96; which has nothing to do with the actual book &#x96; is bad mindset.

I found Fanny boring, and to me Edmund truly seemed to treat her like a sister in the book, and I remember thinking that if I were him I wouldn't have romantic feelings for such an insipid person either (to be honest, he was pretty dull himself). Because of my lack of love for the book, I'd never seen any adaptations of Mansfield Park, and was specially glad to stay away from this one, so hated by my fellow Austen fans.I decided to see it this week for truly shallow reasons I discovered Jonny Lee Miller was in it, and I think he's really hot, especially in this phase of his life (great actor also). So I watched it, and surprisingly, really liked it! I completely understand why fans of the book hate it, if one of the other five Austen books were changed to this extent I would have a fit. Fanny is a completely different character, though a much more interesting one in my opinion. The outrage fans showed over the slavery storyline is specially understandable, it's such a jarring storyline to insert, not to mention it makes Fanny into such a Mary Sue in her I'm ahead of my contemporaries in understanding that slavery &#x96; which has nothing to do with the actual book &#x96; is bad mindset. Also, yes, Frances O'Connor is much too old to play Fanny.Perhaps because I was already well aware of these shortcomings, I let myself enjoy the movie without nitpicking. I found this Fanny a truly engaging character, and for the first time I found myself cheering for her and Edmund (in the book I couldn't care less about her love for him, and the only reason I wasn't surprised he returned her affections in the end is because it's an Austen book and I knew the heroine would get her happy ending). This was because both actors gave much more energetic performances than were to be expected if the script followed the book more closely, IMO.In summary not for fans of the book, completely understand their opinion, but I still liked it. And my crush on Jonny Lee Miller has increased tenfold!

We're not rooting for anyone, we're not taking sides; we're just sitting back and letting the message sink in. What I love about this movie is how it doesn't tell the audience how to feel. It doesn't force people to take sides. It just presents you with racism, and lets you decide how to feel about it for yourself.

It's an awesome movie, and everyone knows it. But what makes it so awesome? Well for me, there are a lot of things. First of all, Robert De Niro is always awesome. This was the movie that really kicked off his career, and he's what makes this movie. Second of all, I love how dark and gritty this movie is. I know there were movies in the late 60s and early 70s that were really violent, but Taxi Driver took it to the next level with its gritty cinematography, realistic setting, and amazing performances. This movie feels so real, that it's actually kind of disturbing. Just like Midnight Cowboy, this is an ugly movie, but that's where a lot the appeal comes from. Third, I love low budget movies that become iconic. It doesn't have the perfection and class of The Godfather movies, but that's what makes it so effective. The low budget look and ugly tone make the movie seem all too real, and not to far off from reality. It's actually very inspiring for anyone who wants to become a filmmaker. Fourth, it was one of the first movies to show the hardships veterans of the Vietnam War had trying to fit back into society (the dark tone of the movie emphasizes how tragic a thing it is for soldiers who have returned home). Soldiers who fought in the Vietnam War were often protested, so I'm glad this movie addressed how difficult it really is for them. Taxi Driver is just an all around great movie. It may be dark, it may be bloody, it may be a little too real for some people, and it may have almost gotten President Reagan killed; but if you're looking for a movie that defines awesome, then Taxi Driver is that movie.

M. Forster novel, Maurice is a true masterpiece. A quintessentially English example of love between men in the early 20th century at a time when homosexuality was still illegal and persecution was everywhere. This delightfully considered and delicately fragrances tale starts with a windswept walk along the beach for an eleven-year-old Maurice Hall and his bumbling although well-meaning school master Mr Ducie, played by a darling of the British theatre scene and all round nice guy, Simon Callow. Mr Ducie tries to explain the rudimentary sacred mysteries of sexual intercourse with the aid of sand drawings to the fatherless young man on the very periphery of puberty. Years later, in 1909, Maurice Hall is attending Cambridge, striking up friendships with aristocratic Lord Risley and the jolly lip smacking lovely Clive Durham. Durham, played by a devilishly handsome and not yet type cast Hugh Grant who seems to fall quite madly in love with the long tall blonde Maurice Hall, and who could really blame him. He surprises Maurice by fessing up to his emotions, which take young Maurice on the hop a bit. At first, he is muddled and confused by the declaration, yet soon comes to realise and accept he has similar feelings for his friend. Maurice is sent down, leaves under a cloud from the academic hot seat of Cambridge and yet, he maintains a strong friendship with Clive Durham. Maurice, with a little help, finds work embarking on an unrewarding career as a London stockbroker. A big fat spanner is thrown well and truly into the workings of a 'happy ever after' life when our two platonic lovers get frightened as university chum Lord Risley is not only arrested, but also sentenced to six months hard labour. His crime was supposedly soliciting sex from dashing army soldier, who may well have been up for it at the time!Maurice is heartbroken he cant have Clive who is now set to marry, he seeks to rid himself of his gay feelings. Maurice and his aloof ways come to the attention of the supposedly uneducated under- gamekeeper working on Durham's country estate. How Maurice fails to notice the adorable Alec Scudder, played supremely by Rupert Graves is a mystery to all bar himself, yet the young handsome manly servant is not put off. One rainy evening a few nights later, Scudder risks everything and yet nothing by climbing a ladder and into Maurice's bedroom, they kiss and spend most of the night 'getting to know' each other.Long-term joys are not on the horizon, in just a couple of days Alec Scudder is booked on a passage to a new life in the new world. Somehow, Scudder misses the boat, confusion reigns supreme for a good long while. Maurice muddled by everything confesses all to Clive Durham who understands little and off Maurice trots to the boathouse. Oh, the rapture and the wonder then he find dear young Scudder there, waiting for him. It's bewilderingly romantic and powerfully affecting, Scudder apparently sent a telegram to Maurice, though it was never received, informing him that he'd left his family and the chance of a new life overseas to stay with Maurice and telling him to come to the boathouse. They melt into each other's arms and the effervescent glow of love surrounds them in a bubble of happiness as Scudder whispers Now we shan't never be parted.Oh, how I wanted my own Scudder, or indeed to be someone else's Scudder when I first saw Maurice back in 1987 or 88, such was the magnificence and beauty of the story. The stunning production qualities, wonderful photography and cinematography in plump richness, exuberant colour with the finest of details all ensure this is one of the finest costume period drama ever made. Gay or otherwise! Forster wrote this mainly between 1913 and 1914, yet it was only published for the first time in 1971 a full year after his death. Forster himself was reticent about its publication mainly because of the legal and public attitudes towards homosexuality at the time. Indeed, a handwritten note on the original manuscript allegedly said Publishable, but worth it? He wanted it to have a happy ending, not the one made up in the film version, but perhaps one of the Scudder and Maurice years later as a pair of woodcutters, having lived a long and happy life together, although this epilogue of sorts was discarded by Forster himself. Many academic types, including those at Kings College, believe Maurice to be a substandard Forster novel, compared with A Passage to India and Howards End. They very nearly did not give permission for the film to be made, or indeed shot on location at Kings. Thankfully, they relented, and the world could enjoy a cinematic masterpiece, filmed in part, where Forster himself would have walked during his days at Cambridge. James Wilby and Hugh Grant excel as Maurice and Clive; indeed many still believe this to be Grant's career best performance. Rupert Graves is magnificent as the beautiful Alec Scudder. In addition, there is a potent supporting cast including Denholm Elliott, Simon Callow, Billie Whitelaw and Ben Kingsley.This movie had a profound impact on my early teenage years, not only igniting a love of literature but also in my acceptance of sexuality, profoundly moving, entertaining and liberating. There are parts now, even after all these years, still make me swoon and moisten my eyes.Read more and find out where this film made it in the Top 50 Most Influential Gay Movies of All Time book, search on Amazon for Top 50 Most Influential Gay Movies of All Time, or visit - http\/\/www.amazon.co.uk\/dp\/B007FU7HPO ","genre":null},{"date":"18 December 2012","score":"3 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" ￼ Quite simply one of the most exquisitely cinematic explorations of gay love that has ever created produced by Ismail Merchant, directed by James Ivory and adapted from the classic E.

M. Forster novel, Maurice is a true masterpiece. A quintessentially English example of love between men in the early 20th century at a time when homosexuality was still illegal and persecution was everywhere. This delightfully considered and delicately fragrances tale starts with a windswept walk along the beach for an eleven-year-old Maurice Hall and his bumbling although well-meaning school master Mr Ducie, played by a darling of the British theatre scene and all round nice guy, Simon Callow. Mr Ducie tries to explain the rudimentary sacred mysteries of sexual intercourse with the aid of sand drawings to the fatherless young man on the very periphery of puberty. Years later, in 1909, Maurice Hall is attending Cambridge, striking up friendships with aristocratic Lord Risley and the jolly lip smacking lovely Clive Durham. Durham, played by a devilishly handsome and not yet type cast Hugh Grant who seems to fall quite madly in love with the long tall blonde Maurice Hall, and who could really blame him. He surprises Maurice by fessing up to his emotions, which take young Maurice on the hop a bit. At first, he is muddled and confused by the declaration, yet soon comes to realise and accept he has similar feelings for his friend. Maurice is sent down, leaves under a cloud from the academic hot seat of Cambridge and yet, he maintains a strong friendship with Clive Durham. Maurice, with a little help, finds work embarking on an unrewarding career as a London stockbroker. A big fat spanner is thrown well and truly into the workings of a 'happy ever after' life when our two platonic lovers get frightened as university chum Lord Risley is not only arrested, but also sentenced to six months hard labour. His crime was supposedly soliciting sex from dashing army soldier, who may well have been up for it at the time!Maurice is heartbroken he cant have Clive who is now set to marry, he seeks to rid himself of his gay feelings. Maurice and his aloof ways come to the attention of the supposedly uneducated under- gamekeeper working on Durham's country estate. How Maurice fails to notice the adorable Alec Scudder, played supremely by Rupert Graves is a mystery to all bar himself, yet the young handsome manly servant is not put off. One rainy evening a few nights later, Scudder risks everything and yet nothing by climbing a ladder and into Maurice's bedroom, they kiss and spend most of the night 'getting to know' each other.Long-term joys are not on the horizon, in just a couple of days Alec Scudder is booked on a passage to a new life in the new world. Somehow, Scudder misses the boat, confusion reigns supreme for a good long while. Maurice muddled by everything confesses all to Clive Durham who understands little and off Maurice trots to the boathouse. Oh, the rapture and the wonder then he find dear young Scudder there, waiting for him. It's bewilderingly romantic and powerfully affecting, Scudder apparently sent a telegram to Maurice, though it was never received, informing him that he'd left his family and the chance of a new life overseas to stay with Maurice and telling him to come to the boathouse.

But it is equally true that war has been commented upon time immemorial on the big screen, sometimes with utter jingoism being involved (as is the case with many a John Wayne film), but usually with a Man's inhumanity to Man comment involved. Such is true of director Stanley Kubrick's 1957 film PATHS OF GLORY, set against the horrible backdrop of World War I and involving a criminal court-martial that, by itself, is even more horrible than the war itself.Based on Humphrey Cobb's classic novel of the same name, PATHS OF GLORY involves a French army regiment's charge against a heavily fortified German ant hill on the Western Front, instigated by an ambitious general (George Macready) who has been promised a promotion by his superior (Adolphe Menjou) should it succeed. Needless to say, despite the efforts of most of the men, the withering mortar fire of the Germans causes the attack to be a crippling disaster; and Macready, looking for someone to blame for an attack that was strategically pointless from the get-go, orders that three men (Timothy Carey; Ralph Meeker; Joe Turkel) who could not advance far out of the trenches be put on trial for cowardice, a charge that carries with it execution by firing squad. Kirk Douglas, who portrays the men's trench commander and who in civilian life is an attorney, is given the unenviable task of defending his men against charges that, just on face value alone, are extremely ludicrous, but he is prevented by the General Staff and the prosecutors (including Richard Anderson) from presenting exculpatory evidence. As a result, not even three days after the Ant Hill attack, the three men are executed. Douglas, however, uncovers evidence of Macready's complicity in the attack and the fact that he ordered other French troops to fire on the psychologically paralyzed men. He also confronts Menjou with Menjou's own complicity in this sick and pointless incident, verbally denouncing the general square in the face.Having achieved a great early standing with his 1956 crime film THE KILLING, Kubrick became internationally known on the basis of this masterful and scathing combination of war and courtroom drama that, as would be the pattern of many of his films, was also the source of controversy. Its depiction of the behavior of French commanding officers attracted a lot of scorn in France, so much so that PATHS OF GLORY was not shown there until the late 1970s; and several US bases in other countries in Europe weren't allowed to show it either until the early 1970s. As with so many detractors of Kubrick's films, however, the French and American military censors missed the point. The film does not dishonor the men who actually did the fighting in the war, but it does severely scrutinize the commanders who sit behind their desks in sheltered chateaus, prosecute wars and trials as if they were marks of manhood, and destroy those who won't follow the most ludicrous of orders. This can be said not only of World War I, but also of almost every military conflict that has come in its wake, from World War II to Korea, Vietnam, Afghanistan and Iraq. What is equally important is how Kubrick, often criticized in his career as a cold director, is able to depict the best of humanity (in Douglas and the three men he has to defend) against both the inhumanity of the kind of trench warfare that World War I was, and the basic inhuman bureaucracy represented by Macready, Menjou, and Anderson. PATHS OF GLORY, much like the similar Lewis Milestone classic ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT, is a hard-hitting look at what war does; and unlike so many jingoistic films of the war genre, it shows how it damages soldiers and also how it absolutely corrupts commanders.Kubrick shot most of this film in the countryside outside of Munich, West Germany, and he gets the most out of his actors, including Douglas (in one of his most powerful and humane performances), while Menjou and Macready accurately depict the toadying commanders who plan and decide with only glory in their minds (but as the old saying goes, the paths of glory lead but to the grave). The end result in PATHS OF GLORY was a milestone film for Kubrick as a director, and a signpost for Hollywood that it could no longer depict war as merely a flag-waving, patriotic venture or grist for political propaganda. It is a masterpiece of the highest order, one of many in Kubrick's canon.

He's one of my all time favorite filmmakers, and one of my main influences. What I love about Woody Allen's films is that they're so simple that they're ingenious. Annie Hall is the prime example of that. The film is simply about the relationship between Alvy Singer and Annie Hall, and that's pretty much it. But here's where Annie Hall differs from other romances; it goes into great detail about relationships in general. This movie gets how relationships work down perfectly, and captures every little detail. Any one who's been in a relationship can relate to what happens in this movie. It's definitely not 100% realistic. This movie bridges together Allen's early, over the top, cartoony films, and his later, more dramatic, realistic films. Which is why a lot of people say this will always be his best movie. The film has a realistic tone and setting, but there are a few moments that contrast perfectly with the realness of it. Woody Allen talks to the camera, he becomes a cartoon character, the characters enter flashbacks, and at one point, there are subtitles that show what the characters are thinking while they're talking to each other. It's moments like that that make this movie so fun to watch, and Woody Allen's classic social commentary dialogue really brings up some good points about love and relationships. I also love how this movie's paced. It's only an hour and a half long, but it gets so much done in so little time. A whole relationship condensed into a little over 90 minutes, and it's still one of the greatest on screen romances of all time. ","genre":null},{"date":"18 December 2012","score":"","review":" I love Woody Allen. He's one of my all time favorite filmmakers, and one of my main influences. What I love about Woody Allen's films is that they're so simple that they're ingenious. Annie Hall is the prime example of that. The film is simply about the relationship between Alvy Singer and Annie Hall, and that's pretty much it. But here's where Annie Hall differs from other romances; it goes into great detail about relationships in general. This movie gets how relationships work down perfectly, and captures every little detail. Any one who's been in a relationship can relate to what happens in this movie. It's definitely not 100% realistic. This movie bridges together Allen's early, over the top, cartoony films, and his later, more dramatic, realistic films. Which is why a lot of people say this will always be his best movie. The film has a realistic tone and setting, but there are a few moments that contrast perfectly with the realness of it. Woody Allen talks to the camera, he becomes a cartoon character, the characters enter flashbacks, and at one point, there are subtitles that show what the characters are thinking while they're talking to each other.
