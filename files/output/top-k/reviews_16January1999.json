That's how I felt coming out of The Thin Red Line.There are some definite positive as well as negative points as many have pointed out, it was a beautifully shot movie, with incredible vibrant color, and striking imagery. Every frame was worth a photographic still. But there are some serious technical flaws as well. Given the number of characters that appear it is simple impossible to keep them apart -- I found I could not even remember any names as I walked out of the theater. There is certainly no cohesive narrative, and no climax that I can ascertain.But then, perhaps I am wrong to insist on such details. Many of the reviewers here have called this movie poetry, and I would agree wholeheartedly. It is poetry in that it gives you a series of images, moods, colors and then tells you to piece them up yourself. Just as in written poetry where word connotation and atmosphere are often more important than message, so Mallick's vocabulary is light and color and mumbled dialogue.I would be wary then, of any attempts to impose a meaning or a point to this movie. I don't know what this movie is about, but I know what it is NOT about-- It is not about the man\/nature relationship, although frequent man\/nature imagery recurs. Yet I find this imagery ambiguous, and at times contradictory. The opening sequence with the soldier living among the natives seems to forward harmony with nature message, while subsequent images refer to nature as inherently violent and cruel. So who's in harmony with nature, us or the natives?-- It is NOT a the enemy is just like us message. Little attempt was made to humanize this adversary. A few scenes showed some Japanese soldiers crying and wringing their hair in utter despair, while others prayed feverishly -- while these suggest human emotion and human weakness, they don't speak as mush as it would if one of them -- indeed if anyone in this movie -- just cracked a smile, or showed some other emotional state besides hysteria. This theme gets a total of perhaps 3 minutes of screen time.-- It is DEFINITELY not about the realities of war. One review on this site which I greatly enjoyed pointed numerous military\/factual errors. Aside from these, the behaviour displayed by most of these characters is HIGHLY questionable. Saving Private Ryan went to extraordinary lengths to place the audience on Omaha beach, using a great deal of eye-level shots in a kind of first-person perspective. The point of view of TTRL is ultimately detatched. Besides which if Mallick were to be trusted, then the entire US army consists entirely of philosophers from the South, with one or two guys from Brooklyn thrown in.In the end the themes of this movie are just as fleeting as the characterization -- great introduction but gone before we could get to know them. This in the end is one of the greatest problems of the movie, and probably is what makes the 2.5 hours seem like 2.5 weeks. By the end, it seems like Mallick isn't even into it anymore. At the beginning of the movie, the voice-over dialogue is mysterious and intriguing. Two hours later, lines like What is love? and Where does evil come from? sound like philosophy for 9 year olds. And, unfortunately, shooting light streaming through trees, or birds perching on branches DON'T necessarily make it deep philosophical material.Nevertheless, as can be seen from the viewer comments, one either loves this movie or despises it. If you're considering seeing it, just consider that you might fall into the former category. As I say above, I'm still trying to figure out where I stand.

How could the woman who helped populate such not-so-endangered-damsel-in-distress films as Halloween and True Lies miss the fact that this film is in dire need of more fleshed out characters? It looks like the one element they forgot to add was James Cameron. With the exception of Alien Nation, Gale Anne Hurd has yet to produce anything that comes close those she did for then-husband Cameron.The film itself is a series of standard genre set-pieces, stock characters and elements. We've got dark corridors, fake scares and PC-diversified crew. Many scenes are crippled by the so-called MTV editing used in conjunction with underlit sets that leaves the viewer wondering what the f**** happened? There's even the fake-out Boo!-oh-she's-only-dreaming ending (which I just saw this same week watching the laserdisc re-issue of Day of the Dead).Mostly, I was struck by the similarities to a film that debuted exactly one year ago this week - Deep Rising. Same ocean, same nearly abandoned ship, same She blowed-up REAL good! ending. Only difference was that I enjoyed Rising a lot more. It has a good ol' time going through its paces, and Treat Williams gives a great smart-ass performances. Plus, there's a terrific tag scene at the end. My advice rent Deep Rising this week and wait for Virus on video to use as a make out tape.

And I was really amazed how I couldn't hold back my tears. This movie is a masterpiece! I remembered that I had also cried the previous times I had watched that movie. But I wasn't really driven to tears by any movie during the last months and so I thought I might have grown kind of too tough to be really touched. And then I watched Forrest Gump again and at least five times a stream of water broke off in my eyes. Scenes like Jenny's return, Forrest naming his shrimps-boat Jenny, the last conversation with his mother or the final scene by Jenny's grave - oh, and when he meets his son... Oh boy! I even started to cry before I saw these scenes because I already knew what happens and that sole expectation was enough to make me cry. I haven't experienced so MUCH and so TRUE and so INEVITABLE emotion in a movie for a very long time. I would go on enumerating all the scenes where I cried, because I love Forrest's pure love for Jenny so much, I love his relationship with his mother, I love his loyalty against Bubba and I love his friendship with Lieutenant Dan... I just love the movie!But of course a really good movie as it is, is not only built on water. It's also a very funny movie. You won't laugh half as loud as you will during movies like The Naked Gun(if you like them), but there is no less humour. The appearance of icons like JFK, Elvis and John Lennon and the - more or less honest - intention to chronicle American history from the 1950s to the 1980s belong to this humour. All these events are made ridiculous and dealt with as though they were rather unimportant, but they also make up the movie. Things look less disturbing, when you see them through the eyes of Forrest Gump! He doesn't understand what's going on and doesn't take it seriously. But would you hate him therefore? No. Do you think you'd have to pity him? No.All the characters are fantastic. Forrest, the moron, who is so wonderfully naive that he would deserve and obtain all the happiness of the world. The proud and unconventional mother, misguided but through and through good-hearted Jenny, dedicatedly silly-stuff-talking Bubba and especially Lieutenant Dan, who is such an interesting and wonderfully created character. Gary Sinise plays him as such a jerk in terms, but always likeable and understandable. All other actors are no less fantastic, but I don't want to extend this to far.

I mostly wanted to read what others said to get some clarity to my thoughts on the film.  I really appreciate those of you who offered your analysis and insight.  Very interesting! The comedy was certainly dark and something about the characters reminded me of Roald Dahl (Charlie and The Chocolate Factory) except for adult consumption, what with the lasciviousness of Simon's nympho sis, Fay. The characters were intriguing.  And as with real people you meet, they grow from caricature to more developed people, but not in any obvious, bursting way.  I disliked Fay at first, cackling at Simon for thinking he could be a writer, not to mention, throwing hot water on him, an act which did get her to wake up to what she was becoming.  As he grew into a poet, she grew as a human being. I think that the question one of the reviews here asks-Was Hartley asking about the merits of making a living writing poetry vs. living the poetic life-is really insightful and clarifies my basic thoughts on the film.  Thank you! Simon really never seems to change THAT much.  And let's face it, next to Henry, he is BORING. Sure, he starts writing, but we as an audience never get to see his writing. Now, obviously it does affect and help people. Henry, on the other hand, never ends up writing anything publishable or good, but he helps and touches people in his life.  Of course, he helps Simon by inspiring him to write and teaching him about literature and life. He helps the doubting priest, who is beating himself up with guilt over the fact that he doubts.  Henry points out to him You doubt because you CARE! And what quality could really be more important in a priest than true caring.  Henry's caring is evident when he helps little girl Pearl, abandoned by her neglectful father.

I mostly wanted to read what others said to get some clarity to my thoughts on the film.  I really appreciate those of you who offered your analysis and insight.  Very interesting! The comedy was certainly dark and something about the characters reminded me of Roald Dahl (Charlie and The Chocolate Factory) except for adult consumption, what with the lasciviousness of Simon's nympho sis, Fay. The characters were intriguing.  And as with real people you meet, they grow from caricature to more developed people, but not in any obvious, bursting way.  I disliked Fay at first, cackling at Simon for thinking he could be a writer, not to mention, throwing hot water on him, an act which did get her to wake up to what she was becoming.  As he grew into a poet, she grew as a human being. I think that the question one of the reviews here asks-Was Hartley asking about the merits of making a living writing poetry vs. living the poetic life-is really insightful and clarifies my basic thoughts on the film.  Thank you! Simon really never seems to change THAT much.  And let's face it, next to Henry, he is BORING. Sure, he starts writing, but we as an audience never get to see his writing. Now, obviously it does affect and help people. Henry, on the other hand, never ends up writing anything publishable or good, but he helps and touches people in his life.  Of course, he helps Simon by inspiring him to write and teaching him about literature and life. He helps the doubting priest, who is beating himself up with guilt over the fact that he doubts.  Henry points out to him You doubt because you CARE! And what quality could really be more important in a priest than true caring.  Henry's caring is evident when he helps little girl Pearl, abandoned by her neglectful father.

Is it really going to be that confusing?  That 'pretentious'?  Full of empty characters?I'm sorry, but from the second this film began, I was completely spellbound. The images are so amazing that I still can't stop thinking about them and I feel like I have to see the movie again.  The story isn't really confusing at all, it's just not a typical movie story.  I guess people are upset because they don't get a straightforward Hollywood story with all the loose ends tied up neatly and they can't get all teary eyed because someone died that they really 'felt for'.  If the idea of a great war movie is to build up a character so that you really like him when he gets killed off, then I don't really think you're getting the point.  No one life is more important than anyone else's...not the Americans, not the Japanese, not the animals and trees that get caught up in the cross-fire between scared children. We're all part of the Earth, we live and die with it, and that's just one of the many things that The Thin Red Line said to me as I watched it.  It's a movie that really makes you think if you allow yourself to, as opposed to just simply drawing an emotion out of the audience. An incredible movie that I'll never be able to forget.  I wish Hollywood had the guts to make more movies like this. 10\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"16 January 1999","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  I've been waiting months to see this movie, and when I started to read all the negative comments, I got worried.
