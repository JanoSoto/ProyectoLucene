I've accused some movies of having gone too far with the use of Computer Generated Images (CGI) and leaning on it a bit too much but in this case, the movie was all CGI and so it should be. Monsters, Inc. is basically a good old-fashioned cartoon, just tens times better than anything we used to watch as kids. And the interesting thing is that cartoons are no longer for children. More and more of these animated movies are appealing to the adults as much as they are to the children. Monsters, Inc. is about something that every child knows about&#133;monsters in their closet. We've all had our own monsters that we were terrified of as a child and they always seem to come from that spooky closet in our room. How did these monsters get here? What are they doing here? Monsters, Inc. takes us into the world of bedroom monsters. Every closet in every child's room in the world is connected to the monster world. While the children don't really get anything out of having the daylights scared out of them, the monster's world is powered by the screams they generate out of children. Everyday, some monsters' jobs are to go and generate power by going around to the human children of the world and scaring them&#133;but the one thing that is absolutely not permitted is for a child to enter the world of monsters&#133;Why was this movie so good? Lots of things. They have fantastic actors as voices for the characters. John Goodman plays the main character of Sulley (big blue furry monster) with Billy Crystal playing Sulley's buddy and sidekick, Mike Wazowski (one-eyed gumball looking fellow). With actors like these two fellows, it's hard not to have good material to work with and I wouldn't be surprised if Billy Crystal adlibbed some of his lines.What also added to the quality of this movie was the ability to capture the emotions and expressions of these characters. Unlike animation of the past, computers have been able to mimic human emotions and expressions with great accuracy. This has allowed for the audience to feel closer and relate to these fantasy actors and create an overall more enjoyable experience.Sometimes technology gets in the way of storytelling. It's happened in lots of movies where Hollywood thought that it could rest on the crutches of technology in place of a good storyline. Monsters, Inc. doesn't have this problem. On a basic level, the story is simple. The monster world is turned upside down when a little human child accidentally enters their world. But what the movie has been able to achieve beyond that is create a story that has good believable characters, even if they are fictional. The characters carry the emotions of what they face across the screen to the audience and the more the audience believes them, the better the story is. It's also nice to see that the humor is not just targeted at young children. I quite often heard adults laughing louder than the children and that's a good sign that the movie is appealing to everyone. I don't have any children but the friends that I went with all enjoyed this movie.Overall, this was a very good movie. The animation was amazing, the voice actors were excellent and the story was entertaining. Go see it.

I loved Pixar's animation, of course, and the story was funny and interesting.  There is a scene in the first two or three minutes of a monster's scaring a sleeping child (actually, a simulation at the Monster utility company), and a second scaring simulation 2\/3 or so through the movie which some children as old as 6 or 7 may be disturbed by, but otherwise the film is great for all ages!The ingenious plot takes place at a utility company in Monstropolis, a world of monsters.  In 8-hour shifts, the citizen monsters go through bedroom doors of sleeping children; the screams that the monsters evoke are the energy currency of Monstropolis.  But even as they scare the children, the monsters themselves are afraid of humans.  What happens when a child accidentally enters an ajar door and comes into the world of the monsters?I found that I enjoyed this film even more than Pixar's earlier Toy Story or Toy Story 2 (both also excellent films!).  Monsters, Inc. is one of those few films that I left the theatre feeling that I would like to see the film again soon while it is still playing on the big screen.  I found the plot and animated characters (especially the main character monsters, Sulley and his sidekick Mike, and the so cute 4-year-old Boo - perhaps misnamed as she was, in fact, rather brave) to be captivating, the colors and music contributing to a fun retro modern style.  The humor could be appreciated by all ages, and I enjoyed catching a brief reference to Toy Story, when Boo picks up a toy featured in that movie.  I loved the chase scene through the seemingly endless doors, and the scene with the Abominable Snowman, who was trying to be helpful (sno-cones, anybody?!).This film is certainly worth seeing again on the large screen and then owning when it is out on video.  The animation is rich; careful repeat watchings will no doubt reveal additional interesting detail, such as  reading of all of the headlines in the scene where Boo is discovered in Monstropolis.Don't miss seeing Monsters, Inc. while it's playing in theatres, so you can enjoy the rich colors and animation.

Trolls, owls, flying brooms, three-headed dogs named Fluffy... all computer animated. Worse yet, it wasn't even convincing. At one moment a character would be real, and the next moment (while riding the brooms during a game of Quidditch, for example) they would suddenly be just another product of some computer program's imagination. Oh wait, that's right, computer programs don't have imaginations. So that might explain why the computer animated humans don't look at all real! You'd think with a visual effects crew of nearly 90 people and a budget of $125 million, there'd be at least one person amongst them who actually knew how to render a human believable.It's hard enough to rest the success of an entire movie franchise on the shoulders of three unknown child actors, but at least the producers could have picked a more capable director to helm the project.

It's a fantasy story that created a world of magic and wonder for children and for adults it brought back something that many of us have lost; our imagination. For those of you who have never read any of the books and have no idea what this movie is about (what rock have you been under?), this movie is based off the first book that J.K. Rowling wrote, `Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone'. The story revolves around a young boy that discovers he's a wizard. All throughout his life, Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) has never been able to explain strange things that happen around him in times of distress. Living with his aunt and uncle, Harry was forced to be nothing more than a servant boy. Although they knew what the cause of these happenings were, they never told Harry and did everything possible to hide his origins. He was never given any kind of attention except when something was needed of him. In fact, his bedroom was the `room under the stairs' and if something strange happened that his aunt or uncle found out about, he would get locked in his room for days or weeks. On his 11th birthday he receives a letter indicating that he's been accepted into Hogwarts School of Wizardry and Magic. Up until this point, Harry had no idea that he was a wizard or that he was the cause of these `strange' happenings. From this moment on, his life changes dramatically as he begins a wonderful journey into the discovery of his abilities and the world of magic.Harry Potter is distinctly British and the worst thing that could have happened is for Hollywood to get a hold of it and make it through their own eyes. So when J.K. Rowling rejected the idea of Steven Spielberg directing it without having British actors (especially the lead actor), it was the first step to a successful picture. Nothing against Spielberg and I'm a huge fan of his but this movie depends greatly on the atmosphere that it creates. And part of that atmosphere was having an old British feel to it. What really worked well for this movie was that it followed the book very closely. But then again, anything that strayed from it would have caused mass criticism from children around the world. However that has never stopped directors and producers before but in this case, this was a critical factor and they were true to the book.I was quite surprised to find out that the three lead child actors are unknowns. In fact, none of them have ever acted and considering that this is their first movie, I think they did an admirable job. Radcliffe, who plays Potter, fits the physical description of Harry Potter to a `T' and his acting is not bad. The young lady who plays Hermione Granger (Emma Watson II) plays the `Miss Know-it-all' quite well although at some points she goes over the top a bit but that's something you have to expect from inexperienced actors. Rupert Grint plays Ron Weasley, the goofy, smart mouthed friend of Potter and Granger. I actually found him quite entertaining to watch. With the way the books are written and the success that this movie has had so far, we can all assume that there will be other Harry Potter movies so I'm sure we'll see these three actors again and only see better and better performances as they gain experience.The rest of the cast is a `who's who' of actors. With seasoned actors like Robbie Coltrane, John Cleese, Richard Harris, Alan Rickman, Maggie Smith, etc. it is near impossible to have poor performances. All of these actors played their parts beautifully and true to the characters developed by Rowling. It also helps that they looked like they really got into their parts and the world they were trying to create. I was especially impressed with Rickman's role as Professor Snape, the dark, brooding teacher of potions. The books description of this character is mysterious, moody and a bit slimy and Rickman pulls that off flawlessly. The one last element that really made this movie was the computer graphics. This is one movie that really required computers to create this world. Like Star Wars, this movie is in a time and place that is unfamiliar to the audience hence its ability to create reality is imperative.There is one thing about this movie that I have to mention. It is long. At two and a half hours, this will be a long sit for children so make sure they have gone to the bathroom beforehand. The other thing is that for those adults who have read the books, the movie will feel long. Because the movie follows the book so closely, you know exactly what is going on and how much further the story has to go before the movie comes to an end. I was watching this movie with my sister and brother in-law and their reactions to it were quite different. My sister, who read the book beforehand, while still enjoying it immensely, like I found it rather long. For my brother in-law who's never read the books, found the two and a half hours flash by. So my advice is that for you adults who haven't read the book but are thinking about it, watch the movie first before you read the book or else the movie will feel really long. It won't really matter for the children if they've read the books or not; they'll be fascinated by everything they've read about come to life on the see on the screen. Overall, I really enjoyed this movie. It was magical and wondrous and definitely suitable for children and adults. In fact the show that I went to was mostly adults. Happy wizarding!

I also think it is the greatest film of all time. I also think it is the moment when cinema came of age, grew up, escaped from the grey stultifying fog of censorship and modern cinema was born. There followed a golden era between 67 and 79 of adult, intelligent, relatively uncensored movies. By 1980 those accountants won out and things dumbed down and commercialised. There are three elements to the film Violence, Love and Humour add to that great Realism.  Faye Dunnaway lights up the screen as possibly the most beautiful woman in the world at the time.On re-viewing it is also exceptionally funny but in a way that has a wonderful actuality to it, never detracting from the gripping realism and tension. This is very, very difficult to achieve.  In terms of violence it set new standards and has a magnificent climactic ending that is a perfect resolution to the story. If they had been strapped into the electric chair or had escaped from martyrdom it would have too  gruelling, too grim, too unjust.

I have not read the books, and know next to nothing about the whole Potter phenomenon.  I'm also not particularly into the occult, though that can be interesting, like anything else.What was not particularly interesting was Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.  I found it derivative and unoriginal.  Every Halloween cliche and image, from magic wands to flying broomsticks to trolls to centaurs, is dragged out of the closet one more time.  The film is fantasy fulfillment for the pre-teen and teen set, and as such has a certain value.  As art, though, it falls short.The acting is the film's greatest weakness.  The child stars clearly were picked for their looks and not any particular acting finesse.  The child they picked - to the accompaniment of international hype - to star as Potter has all the makings of another Mark Hamill.  He no doubt will become a legend among Potter groupies and do the inevitable boatload of sequels, but shows no particular promise outside this particular role.  His primary acting talent is to give a big toothy grin whenever his enemies are tormented or he triumphs at something or other (which happens with monotonous regularity).  In between triumphs, he generally just looks blank, which is a welcome break from his mugging when everyone sees how wonderful he is.The most striking thing about the other actors is how their talents are utterly squandered.  Most striking is John Cleese, who floats in as a ghost and is given absolutely nothing of interest to say.  Perhaps they are setting his character up for the sequels.  However, since I'm reviewing this film, not them, why he is present at all is a mystery.  Alan Rickman and Robbie Coltrane are the only actors that make any impact, though John Hurt is fine in a cameo.  This film badly needed strong contributions from the likes of Cleese, Richard Harris and the rest, but the script hamstrings them and instead dwells on the kids.  It's too bad, because a film about the adults in this make-believe world would have been an artistic, if not financial, success.Technically, the film falls flat in a number of areas.  Most annoying is the background score, which loudly intrudes at every possible instance.  Harry walks down a path - and the music wells. The editing is a horror, as scenes that could have been riveting, such as the chess match toward the end, are butchered.  If you are going to base the outcome of the tale on a chess match, at least show a little bit of the game!  The film's makers clearly look down on their audience as people either incapable or uninterested in understanding a chess match.  Instead, they substitute neutered violence by the chess pieces when they capture each other.  There was no drama, just more chances for Harry and his crew to look around blankly yet again and await the inevitable triumph.  The end of the film, when Potter's school rivals are emotionally crushed, was unintentionally depressing to this viewer.  Can't Potter succeed without his lessers being humiliated?  Not in this film.The affected upper-class British accents make a number of the characters, particularly Harry's friend Hermione, appear unsympathetic and ridiculous at times.  Expecting a 13-year-old to play a know-it-all and still remain likeable was way too much of a chore for this particular proto-actress. The entire film has a certain voyeuristic flair to it, dwelling on images of sumptuous banquets and manor halls and the like.  There is great possibility for satire here, but the film misses its chances and plays it straight. I'm sure a host of comedians are salivating at the prospect won't waste the opportunity.A bit of inventiveness might have saved the film, but that is sorely lacking.  There is little original about this Bedknobs and Broomsticks type of tale.  The hyped ball game in the middle of the film makes little sense, as Harry (of course) saves the day by singlehandedly catching a butterfly or something after half his team has been wiped out, thus nullifying the efforts of everyone else involved.  Ultimately, the film is a fantasy about exciting times at boarding school, with these magical students going back to their homes at the end, which makes no sense at all. Harry saves the world, but what really matters is that he shows that his crew is superior to his school competitors.  This sort of For me to win you must fail ending seems in vogue right now, in films like Legally Blonde, and is far from attractive.Scenes and motifs are ripped off from much better films, such as Time Bandits, Total Recall, Rollerball and The Longest Yard.  I recommend any of those films over this one.So was there anything redeeming about the film?  Certainly.  The three pre-teens I saw the film with loved it, particularly the four-year-old, who has seen it three times (so far).  Hard for something to seem unoriginal when you are that age - which tells you something about the natural audience for this film.  Children and undemanding adults will no doubt find the constant stream of tired occult images and colorful characters riveting, but they do not make for high art.This film, running at about three hours, will be a great babysitter when it comes out on dvd, the ET of its time.  If you have kids, you no doubt will wind up owning it, and if possible should wait until then to have them see it.  Otherwise, try to find someone else to take them to see Potter during its theater run.  You'll be doing yourself a huge favor.  Five stars out of ten for keeping the kids quiet for that long.

Well yes and no. Firstly I should define what I DON'T mean by horror - men in rubber suits or teenagers with outsized cutlery. If these movies were ever scary it was in the early 1980s when 'Alien' and 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre' defined those particular genres to such an extent that no one has ever matched their standard. What I consider horror is something much more subtle and far older - the fears that we all carry inside of us whether we admit it or not.The terror of death; the ache of loneliness; the fear of a believer that there might not be a God, the worry of the most convinced atheist that there may well be one; the committed rationalist who outwardly denies the unknowable; the constant temptation of evil - those have been the staples of horror from the dawn of time and they still have the power to influence us.\tWho hasn't lain awake in the small hours with their heart pounding?\tHas anyone not glanced behind them when walking down a lonely country road?\tIs there anyone who can honestly say that they haven't thought of doing something that they know to be wrong - just for the sake of it?Unfortunately these ideas have been out of fashion for a long time. No one has come close to the superb horror of Robert Wise's 'The Haunting' which made a terrifying movie out of banging on the walls and a shaky staircase. Perhaps it is only 'The Blair Witch Project' that has recently attempted a minimalist approach to horror, but that film could not hope to live up to its advance hype and consequently was something of a disappointment. Fortunately 'The Others' arrived in the UK with mercifully little hype and is something of an unknown quantity.'The Others' takes the staples of a traditional ghost story from the pen of M.R. James and most particularly from Henry James' 'The Turn of the Screw' and produces something that manages to be very familiar and at the same time wholly original. The opening is a wholly discordant voice from childhood radio 'Are you sitting comfortably? Then I'll begin.' It is the end of 1945, the war in Europe has ground to a halt and a world where the living and the dead are intertwined is trying to recover from the devastation. A young family is trying to settle into a large old house, unsure if the soldier father is alive or dead. The opening shot follows Grace (Nichole Kidman) as she walks to answer the front door. There she finds three servants looking for positions in the rambling house. Apparently the previous household staff had got up and left the house without rhyme or reason, Grace escorts the three through the house, insisting with fragile urgency that they always remember to lock doors after them.She offers to introduce her children Anne and Nicholas to the new housekeeper, Mrs. Mills. This is the first of many deeply unsettling moments. The curtains *MUST* be draw and lamps lit. Grace disappears into the children's bedroom and wakes them; what monstrous things are going to emerge? The suspense is drawn out until breaking point and then Grace reappears with two angelic looking children. not for the last time the movie throws you off your balance. The children suffer from a form of acute photosensitivity preventing them ever experiencing daylight, hence the locked doors and shuttered windows. These are the simple props used to support everything that follows.People and a place on the edge of reality begin to slip into another world entirely. Doors open and close of their own accord, the protective curtains are thrown open, furniture moves, a piano plays in the middle of the night and Anne claims to have seen other people in the house. Throughout, Grace tries to reconcile events with her own deeply-held Catholicism, a terrifying construct where Hell and Purgatory are very close at hand. It is this belief that comes under attack, gradually at first, but as the movie progresses, her world begins to crumble. With control always shifting towards the increasingly sinister Mrs. Mills.A slight tale to be sure, but then the best horror stories only provide a skeleton (real or metaphorical) for our own fears.The house is just as much a character as the human beings that live in within; it appears to be adrift from the rest of the World. There might well be a world beyond the massive wall but equally there might be nothing at all. With the curtains constantly drawn the house is filled with a perpetual twilight, but even those times when we are able to glimpse through the windows there is precious little to see with an unchanging grey fog shrouding the autumn countryside. The movie reeks of death; there is persistent question of whether father is alive or dead; the belongings of departed former occupants are covered by shroud-like dust sheets, antique photographs of unknown people (including a particularly macabre photograph album) look out from shelves, whilst the garden is covered with autumnal leaves. Mortality is a presence in the house, even the hope of an afterlife is coloured by Grace's firm belief in the fate awaiting sinners and the less penitent.Nicole Kidman is as pale, brittle and delicate as porcelain in the role of Grace. As her grasp on the control of the house slips with ever-increasing speed, her world begins to falter and it is entirely possible that Grace will shatter under the pressure. She believes in a loving God yet he appears to shun her when she needs him most, whilst the fight against evil appears to have robbed Grace of her husband. Outwardly she tries to maintain the restrained chill expected of an upper-class woman in the 1940s, yet inwardly this is a loving mother and distraught wife, desperate for some form of emotional support.The children are central to the film - there is none of the preternatural adulthood offered by Haley Joel Osment, these are very real children. Nicholas (James Bentley) is at the age where he is stilltrusting of everyone and tied firmly to his mother, a very real innocent. Anne (Alakina Bentley) is older, just at the stage where she is starting to show independence and at an age where children are capable of very real cruelty. Much of the narrative is driven by Anne's interactions with the remainder of the cast, and Bentley proves more than adequate for the task, sometimes frighteningly adult, at other times a helpless child.The servants are characters from the pages of Dickensian fiction, the slightest of the roles is Lydia (Elaine Cassidy) a disconcerting mute who clearly knows something about the house's past, but cannot, or will not let on. Eric Sykes plays Mr Tuttle the gardener and manages to cast off a long history of comedy roles to give a subtle, almost otherwordly performance. However it is Fionnula Flanaghan's Mrs Mills who provides the counterweight to Grace. She gradually unveils herself as the movie progresses, starting off as the sweet-smiling, efficient servant, but slowly transforming into the centre of power in the house; threatening, all-knowing and truly terrifying. Mrs. Mills is a worthy successor to Judith Anderson's legendary Mrs. Danvers from Daphne du Maurier's 'Rebecca'.Extraordinarily, this very British movie is directed by Spanard - Alejandro Amenabar who has redefined the genre with complete mastery much like Ang Lee's take on 'Sense and Sensibility'.'The Others' is an astonishingly beautifully made movie. Each scene is set and lit like an oil painting. Shadows and the darkness play just as important a role as the warm glow from oil lamps and the fires. Daylight where it is allowed to intrude is a frigid blue-white colour, bleaching life and colour from everything it touches. Sound plays an important part in telling the story, there are plenty of minor chords and shrieking strings to set your nerves on edge, but it is the quiet that is the most memorable. Entire scenes are played out in near silence serving to heighten the almost unbearable tension of the latter part of the movie.So is the movie scary? Undoubtedly yes, the pacing is perfect with enough false climaxes and unexpected shocks to keep even the most demanding horror fan happy. It takes its time to set up all of the pieces, but as the whole story is put into place, the screw is gradually being tightened. Situations becomes increasingly claustrophobic, Grace's nerve falters and Mrs. Mills appears to feed on her weakness - where is it leading?Fortunately the end of the story is extremely satisfying and comes quite unexpectedly. In retrospect, or on a second viewing you will see all of the clues to the solution littered through the narrative, but none are so obvious that you will put the whole thing together until the director is ready for you.

This is due in no small part to who they've hired to shoot their films, Barry Sonenfeld at first and then later (starting with Fink) Roger Deakins.   I'm not convinced this should have been transferred to black and white. The studio wouldn't let them shoot in B&W so they compromised shoot in color, transfer it to a black and white print. That way a color print is still available (an inevitable feature on the &#145;special edition' DVD, I'm sure). I don't like the way their compromise looks, though. It feels like cheating.

Man will end up being another such excuse. You could make an argument for it in almost any Oscar category and it's likely to capture a few nominations.

This is due in no small part to who they've hired to shoot their films, Barry Sonenfeld at first and then later (starting with Fink) Roger Deakins.   I'm not convinced this should have been transferred to black and white. The studio wouldn't let them shoot in B&W so they compromised shoot in color, transfer it to a black and white print. That way a color print is still available (an inevitable feature on the &#145;special edition' DVD, I'm sure). I don't like the way their compromise looks, though. It feels like cheating. You can tell it wasn't shot in black and white. I wish they would have held fast and gotten the blessing to shoot it on B&W film. As it is, I can only imagine how much better Deakins' photography would've looked.The Coens have earned the kind of reverence in the filmmaking community that has Academy members and critics looking for an excuse to heap awards on them. Man will end up being another such excuse. You could make an argument for it in almost any Oscar category and it's likely to capture a few nominations. The Academy is looking for an excuse to award Deakins and this is probably it. They love Thornton and McDormand as well. I don't see any way this doesn't get an original screenplay nomination either.Grade A-  ","genre":"Crime, Drama"},{"date":"25 November 2001","score":"","review":"  Man Who Wasn't There is the most subdued of the Coens' films and the longest. They've always seemed to design their work to please today's attention span-deficient audiences. Their latest, though, takes a few moments to look around. It breathes. The film runs only two hours but feels longer. This may be the Coens' most thoughtful, sophisticated film yet. It's many things a comment on the post-WWII era, the economy, flying saucers, and cigarettes (Notice how almost everyone smokes and does so in almost every scene).It's a good story but meanders sometimes aimlessly in true Coen fashion. Once again, it feels as if they made it up as they went along. But if this writing technique has worked well before, why not keep using it? The story always finds itself eventually. Man is your basic normal-guy-in-extraordinary-circumstances story. Ed Crane (Billy Bob Thornton) acts on instinct and doesn't seem to care what the consequences are for his actions. Everything works out well for him as long as no one believes that this common barber could be capable of such mischief. The performances are as usual second to none, especially by Thornton.
