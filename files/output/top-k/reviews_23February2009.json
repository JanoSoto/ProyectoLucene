I thought it sucked.Not the opening, which seems bursting with promise -- a dead man and a satchel full of half a million dollars found in the arid wasteland of New Mexico, the autopsy and the release of the intestinal gas. And not the cast either -- I mean, Mickey Rourke, Willem DaFoe, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, Maura Tierney, Samuel L. Jackson, and M. Emmet Walsh? Not to mention the redoubtable Fred Dalton Thompson.But they didn't bring it home, the films promise undercut by weaknesses in the script and the direction.The script. I was frankly confused. Oh, I knew DaFoe was a rural police officer who was adopting the identity of the dead man and taking his half million bananas in order to find the killers. But then he is swept up in some insane gun-running scheme in Santa Fe involving greedy and corrupt federal officers. Mastrantonio is there to provide a curiously attractive face with a smile that stretches from ear to ear. She is instantly attracted to DaFoe when she meets him, and she tells him so. Ten minutes later she is assaulting him in the shower. After a night together, she is deeply in love with him. Only in the movies. I would happily outline the story for you but I can't. If I got into it any more deeply than those few suggestions above, you wouldn't follow it. Or maybe you would, and it's my fault for suffering a few too many periods of microsleep during this viewing.The direction is pedestrian at best. Every other shot seems to be a close up, as if the production were designed for the television screen. And with the exception of the final scene that has Jackson running madly across the rolling, sugary dunes of White Sands National Monument with a suitcase full of sand, no effective use is made of the locations. The exterior of the La Fonda Hotel is real enough though, as is the hotel itself, one of the earliest in North America. It was established by the Statler chain in AD 495. Santa Fe is an artsy city with its own opera and other civilized amenities and deserves better display. I live in the poorest county in the state, but I can lie in the gutter and stare at the stars.It's too bad really, because the performances are as good as they are. Rourke is the perfect slime ball. Mastrantonio signals emotion with barely perceptible winces -- she's really okay. Samuel L. Jackson is full of indignation, authority, and irony.Yet here we are, with more than a million dollars worth of state-of-the-art arms destined for shipment to unidentified rebels, and it shows up for five minutes then disappears from the plot and the movie.

Basically, in what looks like a not-too-distant future, David Aames (Tom Cruise, also producing) has inherited a playboy lifestyle from his dead parents, and at a party he meets the girl his friend Brian Shelby (My Name Is Earl's Jason Lee) brought, Sofia Serrano (Razzie nominated Penélope Cruz), and he instantly falls for her. He wants to find out more about Sofia, but he is being stalked almost by jilted lover Julie Gianni (Golden Globe nominated Cameron Diaz), and she ends up crashing her car off a bridge, with David inside. While Julie died, David survived and had his face reconstructed, and not long after, he is finding it hard to distinguish between his dreams and reality. He is desperate to be with Julie, but being in an unstable condition, he is first trying to get back to reality, with the help of psychiatrist McCabe (Kurt Russell). In a ridiculous twist ending, you find out he has been dreaming for ages, because he is in fact dead, but he still has the chance to decide whether to go into a dream where he can have anything he wants and be happy, never ageing, or go back to reality and have a normal life, and thank goodness, he chooses reality. Also starring Noah Taylor as Edmund Ventura, Timothy Spall as Thomas Tipp, Tilda Swinton as Rebecca Dearborn, Alicia Witt as Libby, Johnny Galecki as Peter Brown, Conan O'Brien, and look for Steven Spielberg as a Party Guest. This film is one of the most confusing and ridiculous I have ever seen in my life, and I hope I never do again. All the actors are wasting their talents, the story is filled with material you cannot understand - in terms of story and putting on screen, and it just seems like director Crowe wasn't putting enough effort into making a good a film, which I can safely say it isn't. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Song for Paul McCartney's title song, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Original Song. Tom Cruise was number 32 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, he was number 25 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols, and he was number 81 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons. Pretty poor!

It has not held up well.I won't spend a lot of time commenting on the horrific soundtrack as so many other reviewers have already done yeoman-like work in that regard. Suffice to say that Ladyhawke perfectly demonstrates how a score can really cripple a movie. Although, I do have to say that thankfully it is not a relentlessly constant presence, as some terrible scores have been in other films.However, there are other significant flaws with this movie that in my mind are actually worse than the soundtrack. For one, Rutger Hauer is miscast as the hero Navarre and is not nearly appealing enough. The main villain, by contrast, is not UNappealing enough, and as a result you don't have a good guy you root hard enough for nor a bad guy you root hard enough against.The action sequences are likewise tepid. In fact, I would have to say the most intense scene is not what is suppose to be the climactic fight scene at the end, but an earlier scene where Matthew Broderick's character is trying to save the wolf which has broken through the ice. That is actually the most intense and convincing scene in the entire movie.For me, the most poorly realized aspect of the film is the finale. There is a rather dull sword fight in a church between Navarre and the Bishop's captain of the guard. They appear to be doing nothing but trying to make a lot of noise with their swords. Meanwhile, all the extras in the church, as well as the evil bishop, Matthew Broderick's character, and his friend the monk, just stand around like a bunch of stiffs who weren't given any direction and don't know what to do with themselves. That unnatural behavior becomes even more discomfiting as Navarre has his confrontation with the bishop. Nobody comes forward and tries to restrain him, nobody makes cries of distress or outrage or anything. It's cringeingly awful!Then, when Rutger Hauer and Michele Pfeiffer's characters are finally reunited, it almost feels like director Donner just told them,Tell you what, just ad lib some emotion for about ten minutes, I'm going to go out and get a coffee! The crowd of bystanders awkwardly gathers around like a pack of zombies while the pair give a very unconvincing and self-conscious performance. The scene has no dramatic pay-off and instead seems to drag on forever.Best aspect of the film is the cinematography featuring beautiful location shooting with real castles, ruins and mountainous settings.

Every character, save Catherine Keener's (Cecilia), is basically a person who is broken on some level. American audiences are so used to the Hollywood formula of clear cut good guys and bad guys and people who overcome, story lines that have clear cut endings where the good guys win and the bad guys pay, where everything makes sense in the end. This is not one of those movies and it's not the way real life is anyway. If the ending doesn't make sense in that way, it does give the impression that by the end of the movie, the characters are on the precipice of finally finding some peace in their lives even though the audience won't get to see it.Viewers complain that the story meanders or makes no sense and that they don't understand the characters. I didn't find this to be true either. They were very easy to understand and the storyline ties together past events (shown in flashbacks to their youth) and the results of their actions--guilt, relationships torn apart, **everyone** paying (not just the bad guys) while trying desperately to reconcile with themselves and one another to find that it's not so easy to do so. Rather than meandering, I found the story to be shown in a very linear fashion and that exposition is given bit by bit until it ties together at the end.One of the complaints that I found in reviews and on the message board is how Lyle, the one that attained wealth through their shady methods, ends up quitting, walking away from his money in what appears to be an all of a sudden fashion. By the end of the movie, after his story is told in flashback, it made perfect sense to me that he wanted to walk away for a long time and this was finally his opportunity to grab it. His reasoning, talking to his wife on the phone, No more %*@#! lies! and that it's the smell of the alfalfa said it all. He just wanted to go back (perhaps to his youth) before all of the nightmare began and start over. Makes perfect sense. I think it's difficult for some people to comprehend that someone would choose meaning in their life over money or that there are perhaps rich people out there that may have fantasies of walking away from it all. I just don't find that hard to believe.Nick Nolte's character, Vincent, is probably the most difficult one to comprehend because his is the most screwed-up and in the most pain. Because of his actions when young, his obtuse reaction at the time to his then girlfriend (and now Lyle's wife, Rosie, played by Sharon Stone) through in what I'll call the event that tore them all apart and his part in it along with his clumsy and confused attempt at rectifying it with Rosie (and Simms), make his character the most uncomfortable to watch. It's not because the part is badly written or badly played (Nick Nolte plays the part to perfection). It's just because this guy is **supposed** to be uncomfortable to watch.The worst things I can say about it is that there isn't enough Sharon Stone in it. I'm not a big fan of hers but she is a dynamic actress and her character deserved more presence while most of her story is shown in flashback with a younger actress. Catherine Keener isn't given enough praise for her part because her character is the only ordinary and somewhat sane person in the midst of all this and so **appears** less interesting although I didn't feel it was. I think that is the purpose that that character serves--as a sort of reflection to it all. Albert Finney, as the crooked race commissioner who makes one mistake too many and loses the things that matter, is also a prize to watch.

If the ending doesn't make sense in that way, it does give the impression that by the end of the movie, the characters are on the precipice of finally finding some peace in their lives even though the audience won't get to see it.Viewers complain that the story meanders or makes no sense and that they don't understand the characters. I didn't find this to be true either. They were very easy to understand and the storyline ties together past events (shown in flashbacks to their youth) and the results of their actions--guilt, relationships torn apart, **everyone** paying (not just the bad guys) while trying desperately to reconcile with themselves and one another to find that it's not so easy to do so. Rather than meandering, I found the story to be shown in a very linear fashion and that exposition is given bit by bit until it ties together at the end.One of the complaints that I found in reviews and on the message board is how Lyle, the one that attained wealth through their shady methods, ends up quitting, walking away from his money in what appears to be an all of a sudden fashion. By the end of the movie, after his story is told in flashback, it made perfect sense to me that he wanted to walk away for a long time and this was finally his opportunity to grab it. His reasoning, talking to his wife on the phone, No more %*@#! lies! and that it's the smell of the alfalfa said it all. He just wanted to go back (perhaps to his youth) before all of the nightmare began and start over. Makes perfect sense. I think it's difficult for some people to comprehend that someone would choose meaning in their life over money or that there are perhaps rich people out there that may have fantasies of walking away from it all. I just don't find that hard to believe.Nick Nolte's character, Vincent, is probably the most difficult one to comprehend because his is the most screwed-up and in the most pain. Because of his actions when young, his obtuse reaction at the time to his then girlfriend (and now Lyle's wife, Rosie, played by Sharon Stone) through in what I'll call the event that tore them all apart and his part in it along with his clumsy and confused attempt at rectifying it with Rosie (and Simms), make his character the most uncomfortable to watch. It's not because the part is badly written or badly played (Nick Nolte plays the part to perfection). It's just because this guy is **supposed** to be uncomfortable to watch.The worst things I can say about it is that there isn't enough Sharon Stone in it. I'm not a big fan of hers but she is a dynamic actress and her character deserved more presence while most of her story is shown in flashback with a younger actress. Catherine Keener isn't given enough praise for her part because her character is the only ordinary and somewhat sane person in the midst of all this and so **appears** less interesting although I didn't feel it was. I think that is the purpose that that character serves--as a sort of reflection to it all. Albert Finney, as the crooked race commissioner who makes one mistake too many and loses the things that matter, is also a prize to watch. But then he always is.While this movie isn't a pick-me-up kind of thing, I found it intriguing.

It seems becomes clear however, that not all is what it seems in the Hive, and shutting her down soon becomes the least of the teams worries...I am a huge fan of the Resident evil game series. My first exposure was playing Resident Evil 2 on my Nintendo 64 in the dark hours of the night, and jumping out of my skin when a licker crashed through a window, or a zombie that appeared down and out suddenly grabbed at my ankles. I remember playing Resident Evil 3 and being in absolute awe of the Nemesis creature. I remember the dark atmosphere,the ambient soundtrack. I remember the puzzles, some easy, some hard, and some just plain frustrating.The Resident Evil film offers something quite different then we saw in the video games, and many fans were displeased with this. Sure, the T- Virus plays a central role, and a few enemies from the film make appearances ( Those pesky Cerebus, the undead killer canines who often jumped out at random to attack your character and almost always traveled in packs, make quite a memorable appearance), but as a whole this doesn't look, feel, or sound like Resident Evil. And though I love the games, I really liked the slick action and stylish tone of this flick, and despite it's shortcomings, I enjoyed this flick.A soundtrack can make all the difference for a film, or even a video game. Gone are the spooky, eerie, piano ditties that populate the game. To match the high tech tone of the film, shock rocker Marilyn Manson and Marco Beltrami teamed up to create a totally new kind of musical score that adds so much to the film. The film's music is very hardcore, grinding, and violent. It's electronica with teeth, and it's perfect for the film. It gives the film an extra layer that a lot of films, especially action\/horror films, lack.The film offers us no game characters, so we see no Jill Valentine, no Leon S. Kennedy, no Albert Wesker. A whole new slew of fresh faces fill this horror show, and this is one area where the film lacks. Many of the characters are disposable, secondary characters that receive no characterization. Even the main players, namely Alice, Rain, and Eric, receive little substance. Milla Jovovich does a good job as a lead action heroine, her merodic acting is forgivable because this girl has so much presence. Milla's charm make a poorly written character shine. Michelle Rodrigues, who I am not terribly fond of, does a great Vasquez impression (from the Aliens film) and it works. She deliver my favorite line of the film, after dispatching a zombie for the first time. Matt Addison is decent as the wide eyed pretty boy. Also, not to be forgotten, is Michaela Dicker, who's voice work for the Red Queen, the homicidal supercomputer of the film, is superb.Paul W.S Anderson does a fairly good job in directing this film. The film looks very vibrant, with bright colors, mainly reds and blues, contrasted with more darker scenes. There are some very cool shots, and some nice visual references to the game.I suppose one thing that bothered me was some of the CGI. Most notably was the licker creature. Slightly different then the lickers found roaming the walls of the RPD in Racoon city, I was quite disappointed in the final result. The licker is one of my favorite Resident Evil creatures, and this film did him no justice. The CGI licker looked terrible, and the animatronics are not much better. Also tied in with my disappointment at how the licker looked, and behaved, was the idea that the licker was the 'boss' creature. When I play Resident Evil, a few shotgun or bow gun rounds take down most lickers I run into, so the idea of the licker as a boss creature is a little silly.Overall, I really liked this live action Resident Evil. What Paul W.S. Anderson and crew did was simply take the structure of the the Resident Evil story and create an entirely different universe. As a fan of the game, I can say that I truly grooved to this new presentation of Resident Evil. A pulse pounding score, slick visuals,some exciting stunts and a quirky sense of humor all give reason to watch this film. Resident Evil's shortcoming's, mainly a lackluster script and a habit of relying on CGI, are forgivable.And that ending... wow.8\/10 ","genre":"Action, Horror, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"23 February 2009","score":"","review":" When I watched this movie at it's release in '84, little did I know that I would have a connection with this movie till this day.
