But it ends here; because the whole Hollywood glamor, fancy production and Hollywood predictability are so unfitting to the movie they ruin it beyond repair. The scene where Ethan looses his family of gorillas should be one of the most intense and heartbreaking scenes I ever saw but it wasn't, because I just couldn't get into it as much as I could. This is because somewhere in my mind I knew exactly how the movie was going to end. Which is not necessarily a bad thing if the ending is suitable.It wasn't. It was your typical Hollywood ending.I truly hope they remake the story(and this is coming from a person who despises 95% of remakes-well, the ones that are worse than the original) , perhaps find some low-key actors for the lead roles and most importantly make the movie as real as possible. The subject Instinct deals with is probably one of the most important things a person realizes(if he even does) and should not be handed into the hands of incompetent or unsuitable directors. The subject of this movie is finding true meaning of life, finding and discovering how it works, finding you inner self, you primal instincts and discovering that the real world will never be a place we'd want it to be. I'm putting even myself down now, let me rephrase that, the real world can be a great place to live in if you accept certain rules and to some extent do become trapped in your own little illusion. It is a world where Ethan Powell would never stand a chance of surviving or escaping. It is a world where all the Ethan Powells would perish. 6\/10  ","genre":null},{"date":"6 November 2003","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":"  Wow, this movie is truly inspirational because it made me realize that there are other people that think the way I do about the world and the whole takers theory.
