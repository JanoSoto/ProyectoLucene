[{"date":"6 February 2003","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":"  Sheer misogyny knocks down a notch this otherwise brilliant satire of high school teacher-student relations--it has an unusually vitriolic attitude towards women, down to even the minor female characters, and is quite content to lay the lion's share of blame on them, even while lampooning the men. (It can't really dodge its hostility towards women by claiming to be seen from a fearful male's point of view--the narrative is driven by multiple voiceovers of both sexes.) Reese Witherspoon, who manages to retain her dignity even while director Alexander Payne shoots her in the most unflattering ways possible, stars as an ambitious senior running for class president who finds opposition from a genial jock (Chris Klein, playing essentially the same decent guy he would in the `American Pie' series) goaded on by a vindictive teacher (Matthew Broderick) and the jock's lesbian sister (Jessica Metzler), running on her own agenda. Payne brings a seemingly snappy irreverence towards his subject's surface, with a take-no-prisoners attitude about the pathetic little individuals he so detests, but he has the smarts to create a universe fraught with serious consequences that carries a power enough to unify an audience. The screenplay, by Payne and Jim Taylor, based on a novel by Tom Perrotta (unread by this reviewer), is witty, perceptive (in spite of its dismaying tendencies) and articulate; the ensemble acting is outstanding, especially Broderick's, whose recent endeavors find him becoming quite adept at finding challenging roles (in films such as this and `You Can Count On Me') that allow him to dig beneath his all-American charm and uncover some unexpectedly quirky truths about the characters he plays.
