[{"date":"31 December 2012","score":"7 out of 11 people found the following review useful","review":" Probably one of the most anticipated and hyped movies in the history of film-making, and only the forth movie that George Lucas ever directed (which is not surprising as he is not really a director). I saw this movie on the opening night in South Australia namely because I was in the right place at the right time and got a ticket. Personally I was trying not to get excited about the movie or fall to the hype in fact when I saw the first previews I wasn't really impressed, though the second previews did attract me a bit more.What did I think of the movie? Well I thought that the critics were overtly harsh about it, though from all of the critics that I have read, Stan James of the Advertiser was the harshest. That is not surprising considering that I do not particularly like the opinions of the Advertiser. The Newsweek review was quite unflattering, though the reviewers in the LA times quite liked it.What about me? I though the movie was quite well done. My advice is to try to ignore the hype and consider it to be like any other movie, and as such one should appreciate it. I do not agree that the dialogue was bad it did not stand out but it was not bad. Ja Ja Binks - the comic relief was annoying and I had trouble understanding what he said, but he would probably entertain the kids. The pod race on Tatoine I thought was overtly long - another part that I disagreed with Stan James, who considered that to be the best part. I also like Qui-Gon-Jinn (Liam Neilson). I don't know why, I just did. Darth Maul (Ray Park) was said to be the bad guy, but we did not have the chance to really dislike him. In fact, he is really only the emperor's flunky (though in this movie he is only Darth Sidius). The digital effects were well done, but that is not surprising considering that George Lucas, the guy who owns Industrial Light and Magic, the premier special effects studio in the world, did them. Though another complaint is that there were too many, and as Ja Ja Binks was completely digitised, it created problems when interacting with him.The story itself I like. What the movie does is that it expands a pre-existing universe. In fact it builds a foundation in which the star-wars trilogy is to take place. What the movie is going to become is a chronicle of the rise and fall of Darth Vader, though in the later movies the centre turns from Vader to Luke Skywalker (though I am told that in a book, Skywalker becomes a dark jedi). But here we are seeing the beginning of what is to become the empire and the plan of Dark Sidius to collapse the republic and create what becomes the empire. In fact this seems to be what Rome was - it began as a republic but due to inadequacies, the republic collapsed and an empire was created. Even though in Return of the Jedi, the emperor is killed, it does not mean that the Republic will be revived - in Rome, even though Julius Ceaser was assassinated, the republic was still floundering and ended up collapsing to form an empire that lasted about 300 to 400 years.What I like about this movie is the whole story. To me Lucas has created a living, breathing universe in which the events we are watching are transpiring. It is a realistic universe, unlike that of Star-Trek, in which there is always good and evil, and that the struggle always continues. In another aspect, it does take the Zorastriumism idea of the universe being a never ending struggle between good and evil, something that I do not view as the universe really is a tainted creation that is collapsing because of the sin that destroys lives and is crying out for the return of Christ Jesus .In conclusion, I guess this is not the part of the movie that can be criticised. If it is bad then people will ignore it, and if it is good people will agree with it. This movie is really one that people will see no matter what. There is a cult following and because of that, one cannot really make a judgement on it that people will listen to. This is one that people will have to make their minds up for themselves.

But he will find that once you are living that life it is not at all easy to get out. And much to Derek's chagrin he sees his brother Danny going down the same path which nearly destroyed him. Derek knows he has to reach Danny, change him, open his eyes. Before it's too late.The film's story unfolds in an unconventional manner. We see the present-day Derek, a man determined to do good, to change himself and save his brother. This is intercut with flashbacks which show us the monster Derek was. When the film opens Derek is about to be released from prison. When we go back in time to see how he ended up in jail it is shocking and disturbing to say the least. We see a man consumed by hatred and anger. He tears his family apart. He destroys his own life. And he does it all with a sinister smirk on his face. The saddest thing is that Danny idolizes his older brother. Danny is a skinhead too, proud of it. There was a time Derek would have been proud of what Danny had become. That time has gone. Prison changed Derek. How exactly it changed him is told in quite vivid, brutal detail. And when it becomes clear who it was who eventually reached Derek, changed his way of thinking, it all begins to make sense. The path to Danny's salvation appears. There is only one person who was ever really going to be able to change Danny and that was his brother. But Derek had someone very important on his side to help things along. That help had better come quickly. Danny may be too far gone, time is running out.It's a captivating film with an undeniably powerful story. But it's not a film without flaws. While Edward Norton is magnificent as Derek there's the sense Edward Furlong, playing Danny, struggles to keep pace. When Norton and Furlong share the screen, and they share the film's most important moments, there's the sense that Furlong just doesn't measure up. There's a certain level of maturity required to handle the very challenging role and Furlong seems to lack it. There are times it's hard to take his character seriously and that's a problem in a film as deadly serious as this one. The film also has a bit of a disjointed feel to it. The nonlinear structure works but not all of the pieces really end up fitting properly. This probably has something to do with the fact the film was taken out of director Tony Kaye's hands and reassembled by others, most notably Norton. There are places where the narrative just doesn't flow freely, the film bogs down. Kaye has said he wanted to make a tighter, shorter film. It probably would have been better if he had gotten that opportunity. The film also does a rather poor job of establishing the roots of Derek's hatred. One flashback dinner conversation with his father is all we really get and that sequence doesn't really work. It's as if it had to be tossed in because there had to be something there at the root of all this. But it's not enough. And then Derek's prison transformation, again not entirely convincing. You don't let go of that much hatred that quickly.In one of his earlier racial diatribes Derek had invoked Rodney King, the man who famously asked, Can we all get along? The old Derek thought Rodney King was some kind of subhuman, the scum of the earth. The new Derek wants us all to get along. But we can't. Some of us have gone too far down the path of hatred and bigotry. You may want to change yourself. But it's hard to change the world. Derek wants to leave his old life behind. More importantly, he wants his brother to leave that world of hate behind. The clock ticks. Time is not on Derek's side.

In his 13th feature film My Name Is Joe (1998) Loach offers not only a realistic look at the problems of contemporary society but also in a compassionate, heart-warming tone, still leaving the viewer with a rather gloomy mood. Such emotional contrast was probably due to the fact that the reign of Margaret Thatcher had been over for 8 years and the workers' party had experienced a new rise. Hence the film manages to be both a dreary yet essential look at the past -- as if to show what really happened during Thatcher's unpleasant years of conservatism -- and a comment on how the new movement hasn't attained any concrete changes in the desolate condition.The title protagonist of the film is Joe, an unemployed alcoholic, who begins a mundane romance with a social service woman. However, My Name Is Joe isn't a love story nor a wholesome portrayal of a character's life. It's precisely a fragment from the everyday life of an ordinary person. It tries not to highlight (though Loach falls to banality every now and then) nor to embellish. The title first refers to Joe's introduction at the AA-club but later on gains a significance of him opening himself, honestly and without an act of performance, to others.In the same way as Joe, Loach is ready to show us the real conditions of the working class, without an act of embellishment. By a naturalist approach, he depicts the desolate circumstances in which alcoholism and drug addiction are immediate and inevitable reactions. They reveal a wider social phenomenon rather than the weakness of the individual.Although the film isn't a film of sheer brilliance nor the masterpiece to define British cinema, it remains as a small sympathetic piece of work which won't disappoint the viewer and therefore doesn't leave much room for excessive criticism.

The animation is really good, the colors are bright and cheerful, the atmosphere is upbeat, and there are many cute and pleasant moments scattered throughout the film. What knocks the movie down from being a spot-on hit is that the story is a little uneven and doesn't go into as much detail as it could've gone into; that, and a lot of the characters on the side are just sort of there. But Oliver the kitten is cute and endearing enough, Billy Joel is pretty enjoyable as Dodger, Jenny is a cute little girl, and the characters voiced by Dom DeLuise (Fagin), Cheech Marin (Tito the chihuahua), and Bette Midler (Georgette the poodle) have some funny lines here and there. The songs are also pretty good, with Why Should I Worry? by Billy Joel and Once Upon a Time in New York City by Huey Lewis being the best. Overall, Oliver & Company isn't an astounding, remarkable Disney masterpiece that will cater to every audience, but it's fine for children. If you're older, you might like the movie if you typically enjoy any Disney animation as long as it has some fun and charm to it, but if you're a little more discerning\/don't have much of a stomach for cuteness, it probably wouldn't be your kind of movie.
