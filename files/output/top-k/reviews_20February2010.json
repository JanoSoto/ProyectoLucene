Julie, Ray, Barry and Helen are recent graduates of their local high school, and it is quickly conveyed to us that all of the characters have something great going for them-the beauty, the football star, the brain, and the cute, sweet, sensitive guy who is trying to fit in with the group. So, naturally, this being a horror movie, everything is bound to go wrong sooner rather than later. Driving home from the beach they accidentally run over a man in the road and seemingly kill him, and then dump his body in the ocean. A year later they've all tried to move on with their lives, until Julie receives a letter in the mail-I know what you did last summer.It's 2010 and when watching this movie you have to recall that it was made in 1997. So expect to see bad clothes, not so great hair, and not so great music. The plot itself holds up really well, and is really engaging. It appeals to the what if sense-that sense that everyone has- this is so far fetched, but what if it happened to me? For a 1997 horror movie, it was really well. There wasn't much blood, meaning you aren't going to get nauseous watching this film. Most of the characters are likable enough, and your heart pounds as you watch the chase scenes.As for a thriller\/suspense\/horror movie, it was pretty original. Watching this type of movie, you sort of expect to see something unoriginal, something you've seen before. But this movie gives a fresh twist to things, and keeps you guessing till the end. Bottom line, it's worth seeing just to keep yourself occupied for 100 minutes.You'll get quite a few jumps and scares out of it and won't feel like you've wasted your time.

Maybe the camera, which does nothing but sit there as the actors act, could have been made a little less static. But the story screams stage play, which implies lots of talk and not much action. The film doesn't pretend to do all things. But what it does do, it does extremely well.As Margo, Bette Davis gives what I would consider one of the best performances, if not the best performance, in any film I have ever seen. She truly becomes Margo, that fixture of the theater, so beloved yet so insecure. And as Eve, the mousy one, with the trench coat and the funny hat, breathy Anne Baxter proves adept at subtleties that allow her character to change gradually over time.Then there's George Sanders who effortlessly slips into the role of witty, urbane, pompous Addison DeWitt, columnist magnifico, a man whose high opinion of himself allows him to declare to us, as viewers, that he is essential to the theater. Celeste Holm and reliable Thelma Ritter give topnotch performances as well.And the Mankiewicz script, which tells the story of a group of theater people, is heavy on dialogue, but it's totally believable, as characters talk shop and interrelate, by means of suitable verbal conflict and subtle subtext. Even more than that, the dialogue is witty and clever, with tons of theatrical metaphors, like when Bill (Gary Merrill) angrily tells Margo And to intimate anything else doesn't spell jealousy to me, it spells a paranoid insecurity that you should be ashamed of. To which Margo just as angrily spits out Cut, print it, what happens in the next reel? Do I get dragged off screaming to the snake pits?One of my favorite scenes has several people sitting on a stairway at a party. A curvaceous but bird-brained Miss Casswell (Marilyn Monroe), from the Copacabana school of acting, desires another drink. Oh waiter!, she yells out.

It's neither director John Carpenter's best work and doesn't come even close to his best movies (HALLOWEEN, THE THING etc.). However, in this day and age, when all the vampires seem to be brooding, good looking teenagers who try to avoid killing people, it feels good to watch a movie in which vampires are what they're meant to be monsters.The film starts with a group of vampire hunters, lead by man named Jack Crow, attacking a nest of vampires in New Mexico. All the blood suckers are killed and the gang go to celebrate in local motel. At night a vampire named Valek attacks them and none of their weapons seem to work on him. Valek slaughters nearly the entire group, only Jack, his friend Montana and a hooker bitten by Valek survive. Jack decides to hunt down Valek who turns out to be the oldest and most powerful vampire.This film is not meant to be anything more than an entertaining popcorn movie to relax with and then go on with your life, and it works like that. Carpenter keeps the story going, doesn't even try to create any unnecessary plot twists or minor characters, but keeps the story very clear and simple. Music is good, actors capable and the action sequences don't go over the board.James Woods is the definite show stealer here. His Jack Crow is definitely one of the more entertaining vampire hunters I have seen in movies. He's not an old Van Helsing clone, or a superhuman hybrid like Blade, nor does he have an arsenal of ridiculous weapons like Hugh Jackman's modernized Van Helsing. Only things Crow has are a handgun, crossbow and smart-ass comments. Woods obviously has had fun playing the been there, done that guy to whom killing vampires is just an everyday work.In other roles Tim Guinee is a good counterpart for Woods, as the nervous and inexperienced priest who joins the group. Especially the scenes where Woods has to teach him the facts of life are enjoyable. Thomas Ian Griffith looks really awesome as the vampire Valek. Although he doesn't have much to do, just watching him ripping people to pieces is a pleasure, since not many vampires these days has that bite anymore. In fact, all the vampires in this movie look awesome, with pale skin, long teeth and nails, glowing eyes and dressed all in black. This is what vampire are about! So VAMPIRES is not truly memorable film, but if you want to watch a little better film from director John Carpenter's 1990's works, where James Woods is at his best and vampires are not brooding teenagers, then this is a film for you. Put it on, sit back and enjoy.

So VAMPIRES is not truly memorable film, but if you want to watch a little better film from director John Carpenter's 1990's works, where James Woods is at his best and vampires are not brooding teenagers, then this is a film for you.

It's neither director John Carpenter's best work and doesn't come even close to his best movies (HALLOWEEN, THE THING etc.). However, in this day and age, when all the vampires seem to be brooding, good looking teenagers who try to avoid killing people, it feels good to watch a movie in which vampires are what they're meant to be monsters.The film starts with a group of vampire hunters, lead by man named Jack Crow, attacking a nest of vampires in New Mexico. All the blood suckers are killed and the gang go to celebrate in local motel. At night a vampire named Valek attacks them and none of their weapons seem to work on him. Valek slaughters nearly the entire group, only Jack, his friend Montana and a hooker bitten by Valek survive. Jack decides to hunt down Valek who turns out to be the oldest and most powerful vampire.This film is not meant to be anything more than an entertaining popcorn movie to relax with and then go on with your life, and it works like that. Carpenter keeps the story going, doesn't even try to create any unnecessary plot twists or minor characters, but keeps the story very clear and simple. Music is good, actors capable and the action sequences don't go over the board.James Woods is the definite show stealer here. His Jack Crow is definitely one of the more entertaining vampire hunters I have seen in movies. He's not an old Van Helsing clone, or a superhuman hybrid like Blade, nor does he have an arsenal of ridiculous weapons like Hugh Jackman's modernized Van Helsing. Only things Crow has are a handgun, crossbow and smart-ass comments. Woods obviously has had fun playing the been there, done that guy to whom killing vampires is just an everyday work.In other roles Tim Guinee is a good counterpart for Woods, as the nervous and inexperienced priest who joins the group. Especially the scenes where Woods has to teach him the facts of life are enjoyable. Thomas Ian Griffith looks really awesome as the vampire Valek. Although he doesn't have much to do, just watching him ripping people to pieces is a pleasure, since not many vampires these days has that bite anymore.

It had some of the biggest comedy stars at their prime at the time and some capable directors, with experience in- and love for the genre, such as in this case John Hughes.Not only was John Hughes just a great comedy director, he specifically was also one who made some great movies for teenagers and he really seemed to connect with his audience. He knew what teenagers wanted for a movie and what issues were on their minds and needed to be handled within a movie. Lots of film-makers just don't connect that well with its teenage-audience, simply thinking that what they put in their movies is what they want to see. It's the reason why there simply aren't any good teenage comedies these days anymore it seems, with the exception of the American Pie-series and a couple of other recent movies like that out there.John Hughes always claimed he wrote this script only in 2 days. And yes, I do believe this. I'm glad it got only written in 2 days, fore if the movie had gotten written in a couple of months or so, Hughes would had probably attempted to let the movie and its story make more sense and would had probably put a more clear main plot line in the movie, giving the overall movie also some more purpose. But I just simply love the movie for not doing this. The movie often just simply doesn't attempt to make any sense and it's all some big fun non-sense. The movie now is basically just the one fun and crazy event after the other.Yes, in all truth this really was one of the most fun movies I have ever seen. The characters, the events, the premise, it's all so much fun to watch and the movie basically has no slow or dull moment in it.It's also a movie in which the main characters are actually being played by some real teenagers. A movie always deserves some extra points for that. Anthony Michael Hall and Ilan Mitchell-Smith play some teenage characters everybody should be able to relate with. What's on their minds is girls, popularity and sex. Basically all the things real teenage boys used to think about. It was also fun to watch some now famous actors in this movie, in some of their more early roles. Bill Paxton is greatly fun as the prick, military, brother and Robert Downey Jr. also shows up in a quite big early role as one of the school bullies.It's a movie with some great comedy pace and timing in it. Added to this are some good and fun characters and situations and you basically have a great, fun comedy already.

And while Hartnet's character may be a heart throb, do girls really throw themselves at guys so hard and fast that it's that difficult to turn down sex? If this movie was meant for teens, then the producers did young people a horrible injustice by making twenty-something life look so shallow.

This movie is so well written and the scene when Clarice Starling first meets Hannibal there was no scary music or suspenseful build up to a fright, but i was still scared. The types of things Lecter talks about, eating people, murder, dismemberment, he doesn't even flinch at it. I think this movie has one of the greatest scripts ever, one of the greatest characters ever, one of the greatest plots ever and the all time greatest title ever, if you don't understand why its called The Silence of the Lambs I won't explain but if you watch the scene where Clarice talks with Hannibal in his new cell they explain it subtly.Through out the whole movie I was really confused about what to think about Hannibal, I wanted to hate him because he is a murderer that eats his victims, but I always wanted the best for him... strangely. I really wanted him to escape from captivity and on some weird level I felt like Lecter and Clarice were friends. At the same time though, I found him extremely frightening. I guess thats what makes him such a bad ass character. The other antagonist in the film was a serial killer called Buffalo Bill who is murdering girls and skinning them. I found this character unbelievably scary because of his mystery. Some directors try and make the villains scarier by giving them more screen time to see what horrible things they are capable. I think when a character is seen more through out a film, a sense of familiarity is formed with the character. Demme made it so you didn't see much of Buffalo Bill, thus more mysterious and scary. Any scenes with him in it are extremely disturbing, like the infamous Put the Lotion on the Skin scene. The whole plot is compelling and it's very rare for a film to make you feel like the main character was always in trouble. The way the whole mystery is unraveled is clever and well put together. If you are more into a cheap scare film with jumps and sh*t your pants moments I would suggest not watching this movie but if your into realistic horror and psychedelic thrillers The Silence of the Lambs is well worth watching.

I really wanted him to escape from captivity and on some weird level I felt like Lecter and Clarice were friends. At the same time though, I found him extremely frightening. I guess thats what makes him such a bad ass character. The other antagonist in the film was a serial killer called Buffalo Bill who is murdering girls and skinning them. I found this character unbelievably scary because of his mystery. Some directors try and make the villains scarier by giving them more screen time to see what horrible things they are capable. I think when a character is seen more through out a film, a sense of familiarity is formed with the character. Demme made it so you didn't see much of Buffalo Bill, thus more mysterious and scary. Any scenes with him in it are extremely disturbing, like the infamous Put the Lotion on the Skin scene. The whole plot is compelling and it's very rare for a film to make you feel like the main character was always in trouble. The way the whole mystery is unraveled is clever and well put together. If you are more into a cheap scare film with jumps and sh*t your pants moments I would suggest not watching this movie but if your into realistic horror and psychedelic thrillers The Silence of the Lambs is well worth watching. A nearly perfect film.

I've seen clips, and I basically know what it's about, but I have not seen them. Now that may be the reason I like this movie more than others. Believe me, if you are a fan of the Japanese Godzilla movies, I can totally understand why you would hate this movie. And even if you don't, it has flaws, I can see hating it even if you don't like the original. But despite it's flaws, it's many, many flaws, I do enjoy this movie.The CGI on Godzilla did not age well, at all. I mean at night he looks OK, at times. But whenever he appears during the day, and even at certain parts at night he just looks so fake. Maria Pitillo, the actress who played Audrey is horrible. I haven't seen her in anything else so I won't say she is a bad actress, but she certainly couldn't act in this movie. The Pacing is a little off, it doesn't get interesting until Godzilla hits New York. Before that it's very boring. And yes it has quite a few plot holes and errors in logic and continuity, and even geography.Yet despite all those flaws, it's a pretty fun movie to watch. Sure the CG on Godzilla isn't good, but the rest of the effects aren't bad. A lot of practical effects for the destruction of New York city. I actually really like Matthew Broderick in this movie, he's a likable enough protagonist. It does have enough action to keep you interested. From helicopter chases to running through Madison Square Garden while being chased by dinosaurs. There are some fun characters and it can be pretty funny at times.Is it a pretty bad remake, yes it is. Is it a rip off of Jurassic Park, yes it is. Does it have flaws, oh it sure as hell does. But is it fun to watch. For me it was. Yes I can totally see people not liking this movie, I understand. But I enjoy it. Take it for what it is, and it's a fun movie to watch.

Allen's carefully crafted, anti-celebrity image -- the shunning of interviews and so on -- is just as much a celebrity image as anything he makes fun of here. But Allen remains a very potent fantasy figure for critics and moviegoers who want to see him as something like America's resident European filmmaker, untouched by the vagaries and vulgarities of the industry he works in. His familiar, formalized, art-film aesthetic reinforces that perception. It's impressive that, in the age of blockbusters, Allen has managed to keep making movies his way.

During the journey they start discussing their ideas about relationships. Sally believes that it is possible for men and women to enjoy platonic friends without sexual or romantic attachments; Harry disagrees, claiming that Men and women can't be friends because the sex part always gets in the way. Harry and Sally do not stay in touch after arriving in New York, but they meet again by chance five years, and yet again five years after that. The film then traces the course of their relationship following this third meeting. There is also a subplot about a parallel romance between their respective best friends, Marie and Jess.The film is a romantic comedy with a difference. The plot of the traditional Hollywood rom-com tends to be centred upon some obstacle to the love of the young couple and tells the story of how that obstacle is removed or overcome. In When Harry Met Sally there is no obstacle to the love of Harry and Sally- except perhaps their refusal to admit that there is no obstacle. The plot, in fact, is a good deal less complicated than that of many romantic comedies, and we know that it is only a matter of time before Harry and Sally will fall for one another. This, of course, raises the question of which of them was right in their original disagreement. The obvious answer, of course, is that Harry was; he and Sally did not succeed in remaining just friends but ended up going to bed together. Yet in another way Sally was correct. Friendship and romantic love (which is about a lot more than mere sexual attraction) are not as distinct from one another as Harry assumed, and the first can be seen as a necessary, if not a sufficient, condition of the second.What sets this film apart, however, from the hundreds of bog-standard rom-coms which Hollywood has churned out over the years is neither the plot nor the ideas discussed but the standards of the script and of the acting. Billy Crystal, another diminutive Jewish New Yorker who began his career as a stand-up comedian, has always struck me as a younger, better-looking version of Woody Allen, and his films often remind me of Allen's. Forget Paris had something in common with Broadway Danny Rose, and When Harry Met Sally seems to have been influenced by Annie Hall, another romance set in New York. Harry wisecracks his way though the film like Alvy Singer (and many other Woody incarnations), although he is more self-confident and less neurotic than most of Woody's characters, and Sally may owe something to Diane Keaton's Annie. Even the use of a split screen to show both main characters simultaneously when they are not together is derived from the earlier film.The script is officially credited to Nora Ephron, but in fact much of the dialogue appears to have been contributed by Crystal and the director Rob Reiner, a close friend of Crystal's, and some of the incidents were based on happenings in Reiner's t own life. The film's most famous scene is, of course, the one in the restaurant where Meg Ryan pretends to have an orgasm; the restaurant in question, Katz's Deli in Manhattan, is a real institution, and now marks with a commemorative sign the table where this scene was shot. There is also some very funny dialogue, much of it well up to Woody Allen standards. (Harry, you might not believe this, but I never considered not sleeping with you a sacrifice).Both the sparklingly witty Crystal and Ryan are brilliant as the main characters, so much so that one overlooks the age discrepancy between them. (Harry and Sally are supposed to be contemporaries, but in fact Crystal is thirteen years older than Ryan). It is strange to thing that Ryan was not the first choice for Sally; that was apparently Susan Dey, with Ryan several names further down Reiner's list. Although Meg had played the female lead in a few earlier films, such as The Presidio, this was the one that really made her a star, and lead to her becoming one of Hollywood's two great romantic comedy queens of the nineties. (The other was Julia Roberts). Ryan was to work together with Ephron in two of her future rom-coms, Sleepless in Seattle and You've Got Mail. Here her Sally is an enchanting, angelic-looking girl, although one who has her own eccentricities. Besides her tendency to fake orgasms in inappropriate locations, she can be infuriatingly picky about her food, leading Harry to dub her a high-maintenance woman. (The film was, allegedly, responsible for popularising this particular usage, although here Harry is using the phrase to mean that Sally demands a lot of attention, not, as it is often used today, to mean that she demands that he spend a lot of money on her).I would not rate the film quite as highly as Annie Hall, but then for me very few films can rank with Woody at his best. When Harry Met Sally is certainly one of the best romantic comedies of the eighties- indeed, it is probably my favourite except for Crocodile Dundee. 8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"20 February 2010","score":"","review":" In 1977, Harry Burns and Sally Albright have just graduated from the University of Chicago and meet when both need someone to share the drive back to New York. During the journey they start discussing their ideas about relationships. Sally believes that it is possible for men and women to enjoy platonic friends without sexual or romantic attachments; Harry disagrees, claiming that Men and women can't be friends because the sex part always gets in the way. Harry and Sally do not stay in touch after arriving in New York, but they meet again by chance five years, and yet again five years after that. The film then traces the course of their relationship following this third meeting. There is also a subplot about a parallel romance between their respective best friends, Marie and Jess.The film is a romantic comedy with a difference. The plot of the traditional Hollywood rom-com tends to be centred upon some obstacle to the love of the young couple and tells the story of how that obstacle is removed or overcome. In When Harry Met Sally there is no obstacle to the love of Harry and Sally- except perhaps their refusal to admit that there is no obstacle. The plot, in fact, is a good deal less complicated than that of many romantic comedies, and we know that it is only a matter of time before Harry and Sally will fall for one another. This, of course, raises the question of which of them was right in their original disagreement. The obvious answer, of course, is that Harry was; he and Sally did not succeed in remaining just friends but ended up going to bed together. Yet in another way Sally was correct. Friendship and romantic love (which is about a lot more than mere sexual attraction) are not as distinct from one another as Harry assumed, and the first can be seen as a necessary, if not a sufficient, condition of the second.What sets this film apart, however, from the hundreds of bog-standard rom-coms which Hollywood has churned out over the years is neither the plot nor the ideas discussed but the standards of the script and of the acting.

Not only do we see his eccentric and outrageous characters blowing up and acting insane, but we also kind of feel it. Gilliam is a fan of epic close-ups and steady cam. Both give us a better feel of what's going on inside a character's head. I felt that a lot whenever Brad Pitt was having a schizophrenic moment in the movie. Side note, this movie promptly reminded me that Brad Pitt is an awesome actor. Brad Pitts frantic eyes and birdlike jerkiness made me feel a bit uncomfortable.

I consider Stanley Kubrick's 2001 A Space Odyssey to be the best film ever made, and the only Kubrick film I have seen until now. A Clockwork Orange is a brilliant and very unusual work of film-making. I am sure many people, and critics, still dismiss it to this day of some sort of nasty piece of work, especially when taken out of context and because many will think Kubrick is trying to make us emphasize with Alex and his violent acts because of the different music, especially the ending titles. One can argue that the ending credits' Singing In The Rain's cheery tone is meant to make us feel happy for Alex's transformation back to the way he was. It is true that A Clockwork Orange is a piece of futuristic fiction but also true that Kubrick tries to clear out it's themes in a satirical way. It even does not feel futuristic at all when thought about because it's presentation of ultra-violence can be seen in the present, even today. It is a meditation on society, and even nearly 40 years later that is still clear when I watched it. It is clear because of the dark comedic aspects of the film. A Clockwork Orange's themes are horrifying, because it then seems to first ask, then answer, the question about whether our basic human instincts, whether violent or not, should be respected and not tampered with instead of clarifying them to make a simple, clean solution. I have heard from many people, mostly young, that they love this film because they think it is 'cool'. Of course, the violence and the way scenes are filmed will surely please many audiences who really are not sure what to make of a film like this that, if done differently, would not satisfy them. It is all about style for some, and about what a film holds, but not about what a film means. If this is the case, then it would certainly be better if these people simply did not like this film and called it 'boring' or 'confusing', words that are given to many classics today. The film is taken out of context into something that is almost like abusing it's maturity, which can be seen in the actual film itself. A Clockwork Orange is truly a genius film. I can already foreshadow the time that I will set a date to rewatch it, since like 2001, it is a film that requires multiple viewings. The film is in itself a very disorienting and, clearly, risky film.
