When remaking the 1960's classic, it created some ticket sales because of the original franchise. The trouble with this remake is that the golly-gee whiz special effects of today are put in as replacements for the original dramatic script of the past epic film.The result is definitely mixed, and skewed towards the lower end of the scale. The remake is so focused on using these new special effects, they create a new ending for this film which is truly horrible compared with the original Rod Sterling epic.The story of reverse evolution theory is classic with Ape evolving from man, and Tim Burton's legion of fans might get a kick out of this, but my take is to see the original. It tells the story better and is dominated by drama more than special effects.

The Shawshank Redemption is emotionally fulfilling in every way, uplifting its audience again and again. Darabont's screenplay, adapted from (and expanded upon) Stephen King's short novella Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption, is at once soul stirring, heart-rending and disarmingly funny. As director, Frank Darabont brings this poignant and oft times surprising (largely unpredictable thank goodness) script to the screen with the kind of loving care that only a writer\/director can, ensuring that all the right elements are brought to the surface.Startling performances from Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman and the entire support cast help make this picture a powerful production. As convicted double murderer Andy Du Fresne, Robbins portrays innocence and determination superbly. He's a man who not only strongly believes he has a future, but that it's a good one. Freeman is spot on as the world weary Red, the lifer who specialises in the supply of merchandise (whatever you want) to other inmates. He is gradually transformed, and always surprised, by Andy's optimism, geniality and brilliance. In support of these two leads are some very strong turns which provide an over all feast of superlative acting talents.The cinematography is superb, capturing some spectacular images of the foreboding Shawshank prison, while Thomas Newman's music is awe inspiring and must be duly recognised as a truly moving composition.The Shawshank Redemption is a long movie, though it would seem that to shorten it would mean to miss out on some powerful, if not crucial scenes. In this light, the editing team have done a marvellous job.What makes this film so effective is Darabont's brilliant script and astute direction, coupled with the strong acting and great support production. Darabont achieves all his objectives, making us laugh, cry, listen and think, he both surprises and inspires us many times. We're left in the end with an uplifting and wholly satisfying movie, which is unexpectedly memorable and magnificently rewarding. A definite triumph of the human spirit.Perhaps the conclusion could be called simplistic, but certainly not expected, and that's what makes this story so great. The Shawshank Redemption comes from nowhere to really hit you with its well written characters and even its carefully researched history. Wonderfully emotionally telling and thankfully intellectually sharp, its a pleasure that you must treat yourself to! Look for two brilliantly played characters in the form of the menacingly sinister Warden (Bob Gunton) and the despicable, ruthlessly violent Captain of the Guards (Clancy Brown).Thursday, July 27, 1995 - Waverley Pinewood CinemaThe Shawshank Redemption was the surprise of 1994 from director Frank Darabont. Full of emotional highs both comic and poignant, it is by far the best prison film I've ever seen. Performances from Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are truly inspired, whilst a classy support cast lend strong backing. Cinematography is at times breathtaking and Thomas Newman's score is sweeping and melodic.For uplifting cinema that constantly comes form nowhere to move its audience you can't go past The Shawshank Redemption.Tuesday, April 30, 1996 - Astor Theatre ","genre":null},{"date":"19 February 2008","score":"7 out of 11 people found the following review useful","review":" From the director of 1990's Buried Alive comes perhaps the strongest drama of 1994.
