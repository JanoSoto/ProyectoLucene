Magnum Force doesn't succeed here quite as well - there's a ridiculously implausible air hijack fiasco for example. The scenes aren't permeated with Harry's black humour either, which renders them mostly into excuses to engage in random acts of violence.Having said all that above, Magnum Force is still enjoyable. Eastwood has no problem playing Harry - just place a sneer on your face. It's nice to see that Harry actually enjoys the company of others and cares about people - the family he visits, his partner, the neighbouring girl - and there are one or two lines in it that raised a smile (though none approaching the classic status of I know what you're thinking - did he fire..).

For every The Color of Money, there are several Two Jakes, pointless sequels made for a quick buck that may or may not materialize. Go ahead and toss Crocodile Dundee in Los Angeles into the pointless category. I guess you could watch this with your kids for harmless fun.

However, I did not choose to see it in theaters until after hearing many outstanding recommendations from friends.  I heard such comments as man, this movie will mess with your mind!, I still don't understand it, you have to watch it a few times to get it, and many variations on the special effects are awesome!.  I consider myself to be a fan of mind-benders, and the occasional sweet special effect is always welcome in my book.  So I go and see The Matrix.  In my first viewing, I literally fell asleep.  Now, you must be wondering how a person could possibly fall asleep watching such an action packed film.  It was easy.  The action just doesn't do it for me. You might also wonder why I would write a review for a movie I didn't see in it's entirety.  Actually, I rented it on DVD and sat through the whole thing months later.  I have many large complaints with The Matrix.  Let's start with the whole mind-bender thing.  A psychological thriller this is not. In fact, the fairly unoriginal concepts behind the story are presented in the first 20 minutes or so, and then pretty much never mentioned again. This movie will not keep anyone thinking unless they are incredibly stupid and can't get past the first 20 minutes.  The special effects and the visuals in general are indeed spectacular.  Good for them.  That doesn't do a whole lot for me when there is no substance to back them up.  The Matrix, as a whole, is an exercise in style over substance.  In all fairness, it is very stylish.  Here's the main problem the movie does about 20 minutes of posing as a psychological thriller (as the trailers would have you believe), and then drops you off into the realm of sci-fi and video game violence. The characters basically just start fighting, running, and shooting things. It feels every bit as stupid and pointless as the next action movie.  The only saving grace is the fact that it is much prettier than the next action movie.  Once again, eye candy is the key to this movie.  Although it seems to easy, I will rail on Keanu Reeves performance in The Matrix.  Well, actually, the only thing that can be said about it is that it was weak (like all Keanu's performances, I suppose).  Fortunately, it won't distract most viewers from all the cool explosions, gun shots, and camera tricks.In summation, don't go in expecting an intelligent movie, you'll be disappointed.

I haven't seen any of Altman's past work.  I only know him by reputation.  He is known to be a very talented filmmaker--at least that's what most people believe--who specializes in films that contain an ensemble of characters.  Well, if I gave a damn about any of these characters, I wouldn't hold anything against Altman.  But none of these characters--except for Maggie Smith's, slightly--engaged me.  The movie is about two hours and fifteen minutes and feels like an eternity.  It's like watching a stage play--a very boring one.  The characters talk and talk and talk and talk some more.  So it is a dialogue-driven piece.  Even dialogue-driven pieces often have some visual eye candy, though not in abundance.  Anybody who has read a book on Screenwriting knows that audiences do not want to see talking heads!  OK, there are movies like American Buffalo and The Big Kahuna which are both based on plays and contain lots of talking heads, but the acting is so powerful in those movies that I didn't feel nearly as claustrophobic as I did when watching Gosford Park.  Now, the cast is definitely full of talent.  As my Dad said--and he's pretty much right--most of our greatest actors come from England.  And many of those great English actors are in this movie  Helen Mirren, Maggie Smith, Jeremy Northam, Kristen Scott Thomas, etc.  But their characters are so dull that they really didn't have much to work with.  But I do have to say--and this is just me--that the English accents are thick and sometimes quite hard to understand.  Of course, if this movie didn't depend too much on dialogue, I could still catch on to the story.  But since it does, I had a hard time keeping track of the story.  I was at the point where I was struggling to stay awake and about halfway through I didn't even bother trying to figure it out.  The humor is quite bland.  Once again, maybe it's just because I'm American and I don't share the English mentality.  Though I've seen a fair deal of funny English comedies, let's face it--there are always certain things that are funny to one ethnic group, and not funny to others.  So I'll give the comedy element the benefit of the doubt.  If this were an American movie and it wasn't funny--I have the right to say it's not funny.  I'd rather keep an open mind.  However, Maggie Smith has a few funny lines.  I like the scene in which Bob Balaban, who plays a hotshot Hollywood director, is about to pitch the story for his new movie, but he doesn't want to give anything away.  Smith comments, It's OK.  We're not gonna see it anyway.  I wouldn't exactly say that she deserves an Oscar for her role, but she is the one person who actually breathed some life into this film and I commend her.    This is basically supposed to be a mystery\/thriller, and it could've been much more intriguing.  That's why I compare this movie to a boring, monotonous college professor giving a lecture  You know that whatever he's teaching can be fun and exciting, but it's delivered in such a deadpan fashion that no one cares to listen--or in this case, watch. Maybe the artistic quality of this film completely flew over my head; maybe not.  You be the judge.  I'm just giving my honest, unpretentious opinion.  If you want to see something deep and compelling, and keeps you interested, I suggest you buy a ticket for In the Bedroom.  But if you find Masterpiece Theater moving and thought-provoking, you'll probably have a ball with Gosford Park.My score  3 (out of 10)     ","genre":null},{"date":"21 February 2002","score":"2 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":"  No offense to those who found this movie to be brilliant--but I got nothing!

Now, the cast is definitely full of talent.  As my Dad said--and he's pretty much right--most of our greatest actors come from England.  And many of those great English actors are in this movie  Helen Mirren, Maggie Smith, Jeremy Northam, Kristen Scott Thomas, etc.  But their characters are so dull that they really didn't have much to work with.  But I do have to say--and this is just me--that the English accents are thick and sometimes quite hard to understand.  Of course, if this movie didn't depend too much on dialogue, I could still catch on to the story.  But since it does, I had a hard time keeping track of the story.  I was at the point where I was struggling to stay awake and about halfway through I didn't even bother trying to figure it out.  The humor is quite bland.  Once again, maybe it's just because I'm American and I don't share the English mentality.  Though I've seen a fair deal of funny English comedies, let's face it--there are always certain things that are funny to one ethnic group, and not funny to others.  So I'll give the comedy element the benefit of the doubt.  If this were an American movie and it wasn't funny--I have the right to say it's not funny.  I'd rather keep an open mind.  However, Maggie Smith has a few funny lines.  I like the scene in which Bob Balaban, who plays a hotshot Hollywood director, is about to pitch the story for his new movie, but he doesn't want to give anything away.  Smith comments, It's OK.  We're not gonna see it anyway.  I wouldn't exactly say that she deserves an Oscar for her role, but she is the one person who actually breathed some life into this film and I commend her.    This is basically supposed to be a mystery\/thriller, and it could've been much more intriguing.  That's why I compare this movie to a boring, monotonous college professor giving a lecture  You know that whatever he's teaching can be fun and exciting, but it's delivered in such a deadpan fashion that no one cares to listen--or in this case, watch. Maybe the artistic quality of this film completely flew over my head; maybe not.  You be the judge.  I'm just giving my honest, unpretentious opinion.  If you want to see something deep and compelling, and keeps you interested, I suggest you buy a ticket for In the Bedroom.  But if you find Masterpiece Theater moving and thought-provoking, you'll probably have a ball with Gosford Park.My score  3 (out of 10)     ","genre":"Drama, Mystery"},{"date":"21 February 2002","score":"2 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":"  No offense to those who found this movie to be brilliant--but I got nothing!  I haven't seen any of Altman's past work.  I only know him by reputation.  He is known to be a very talented filmmaker--at least that's what most people believe--who specializes in films that contain an ensemble of characters.  Well, if I gave a damn about any of these characters, I wouldn't hold anything against Altman.  But none of these characters--except for Maggie Smith's, slightly--engaged me.  The movie is about two hours and fifteen minutes and feels like an eternity.  It's like watching a stage play--a very boring one.  The characters talk and talk and talk and talk some more.  So it is a dialogue-driven piece.  Even dialogue-driven pieces often have some visual eye candy, though not in abundance.

I was really scared, very entertained and very content with what I was seeing. The movie starts with an action sequence that nails you right to your seat.The rest of the movie is like a roller coaster ride in a haunted house.Ok, maybe the plot development had some little flaws. The movie explains very little, so the viewers have to make their own deductions.The director could have given some hints to the viewer and not leave us guessing in more than one occasion. What ever disturbed me (gaps in the plot) was soon forgot as the movie played on. 13 Ghosts has the nastiest looking ghosts I've seen in a long time.
