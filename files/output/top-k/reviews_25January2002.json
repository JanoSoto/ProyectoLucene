The only time you saw inequity was when an adult addressed the issue.2) In the end, when all was said and done, Uncle Remus was not only the hero, but also the one who showed everyone appearances can be deceiving. It was his so-called nonsense and stories that united everyone, and his love for others and the love for him that won in the end. He was the one that saw the problem, knew what needed to be done, and went and did it. Not the boy's mom, grandma, or any other real family member. It was this ignorant slave. In the end, it was his actions that gained him acceptance and the rejection by the adults were dismissed.3) Also, did anyone care to notice that the boy's father always had a great respect for Uncle Remus? While other adults dismissed Uncle Remus, the father had grown with him as a boy, and remembered that this loveable man brought him joy and showed him the beauty of life.Yes, it was a different time back then. Yes, certain stereotypes were more acceptable then than now. But in spite of all of it, the message in the end is positive, and bridges the barrier between the races. Isn't that the point? The path may be dark by today's standards, but it's the message at the end we walk away with.It is a shame that pressure from groups like the NAACP and others see fit to pressure Disney to suppress this movie in the US. I think if this movie was truly as racist as people claim, it wouldn't even have made it to be released everywhere else in the world.I can think of a dozen other movies that contained much more racist characters without the benefit of a positive message that are in general release today. Even that great classic Showboat has similar elements of racism, and that is one of the most widely available musicals, although once again, there was some positive with the negative there.OK. The Tar Baby is a potential hot point. I won't say the movie was perfect, but again, which is more important... The conclusion, or the path you take? I think most would agree that the conclusion is the most important point. May Disney find it in their collective corporate wisdom to release this movie again.

Rather than providing us with a new, original narrative or daring changes of character direction, it is content to merely serve up variations of the same raunchy gags that made the original a surprise hit in 1999.  Some of these gags are admittedly successful, but the phrase Been there, done that hangs heavy over the entire film.It's the summer after freshman year at college, everyone's back home and hornier than ever.  Our five male heroes rent a lake house in Grand Harbor, Michigan and spend the summer doing just what they spent the previous film doing  trying to get in girls' pants.  A few subplots emerge  Jim (Jason Biggs) enlists the help of his spunky, slyly perverted prom-night one-night-stand Michelle (Alyson Hannigan) in getting him ready for a return visit from Nadia (Shannon Elizabeth), the hot exchange student Jim humiliated himself with in the first Pie.  Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas) and Vicky (Tara Reid), having split up after losing their virginity together, struggle with their feelings for each other, while Oz (Chris Klein) and Heather (Mena Suvari) try their best to carry on a long-distance relationship (complete with ill-conceived phone sex).  Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas) turns to tantra to harness sexual energy for HIS big return visit from Stifler's mom.  And Stifler (Seann William Scott)...well, he's Stifler. It all comes together at a big party at the beach house, but not before some expectedly crude gags involving champagne, Super Glue, and a strategically placed trumpet.Since a film like American Pie 2 does not require ground-breaking new film techniques (the tech work and J.B. Rogers' direction are competent and unobtrusive, as they should be), the picture basically hinges on the actors and the writing.  The entire cast is back from the first film, but they are not as well-balanced as in the first picture.  Pie 1 was an ensemble piece; this is really Jason Biggs' film.  Fortunately, he brings a lot to the table.  Jim is the latest variation of an always amusing teen-film stereotype, the cool nerd (a type that reached its apex, I believe, with Jon Cryer's Ducky in Pretty in Pink), and Biggs attacks the role with charisma and a breathtaking lack of guile.  Whether battling Super Glue attached to his, um, yeah, or pretending to be a special trumpet player at Michelle' s band camp, Biggs is utterly unafraid to look bad, to embarrass himself, to be the clown.  In a film like this, that is invaluable, and most of the film's laughs belong to him.The other actors have varying degrees of success.  Thomas still amuses with his sleepy-eyed style (though I liked Finch better with his golf and mochachinos), and Eugene Levy, back as Jim's dad, has some obliviously inspired moments.  Hannigan is perky and weirdly charming; she makes Michelle the kind of girl you realize, after you've struck out with the ice-witch goddess, is the REAL perfect woman.  Sadly, Klein (one of the best actors in this group) and Suvari are hung out to dry, and Nicholas and Reid spend most of their screen time just looking uncomfortable being around each other.  Natasha Lyonne is wasted, her sex-guru character seemingly here just because she was in the first film.  And Scott...well, it's interesting about him.  I have not seen him play any other role but Stifler, and he inhabits it so truthfully, with such raw bravado and blithe nastiness, that I have no way of saying if it's a great performance or if Scott is a jerk and just being himself.  But I can say this for sure  Stifler's still a piece of work.Sadly, screenwriter Adam Herz, back from the first film, largely lets his cast down.  The subplots are doled out in perfunctory fashion, with so much emphasis placed on Jim's predicaments that the others sometimes barely seem to be in the film at all.  There's no great unifying idea like the first film's sex pact pulling the story together.  Basically Herz is happy to play variations on the first film's jokes; he's like a jazz musician who knows a thousand different ways to play the only song he knows.  Liked Jim and the pie in the first film?  Here he is with himself glued to...himself. Liked the Internet humiliation with Nadia?  Here all the guys are eavesdropped on (via walkie-talkie) with two possible lesbians.  Even the revolting beer gag from the first film is reprised, this time with urine standing in for champagne.  My feeling is that if you're not going to come up with an original story, at least try to give us new jokes.Admittedly, there's a few moments where Herz nails the young-adult mind right on the button (like when Jim sees Vicky, who hasn't changed a bit in the year since they've last seen each other, and exclaims, Wow!  Vicky got hot!), and the film has a lot of heart mixed in with its raunch.  Still, as I watched the film, I realized that I wasn't going to see anything new.  I might just as well have watched the first film again; that one had heart, gags, a story, AND the element of surprise on its side.  Funny though parts of this film may be, it's really just more of the same.  They should have called it American Pie Too.

NOW!Simply put, The Mothman Prophecies is the scariest horror movie since RING, Since many Americans won't be able to see RING for quite some time, they should consider tasting another slice of the terror pie with Mothman. It's already a strong candidate for best horror film of 2002...and even as a hardcore genre fan, I'd have to put it on my list of favorite horror movies of all time.I had been fascinated by the Mothman myth since 1995, when I first read of its existence in a book of legends and folklore. Since then, I've often thought about making a horror film based on the story. And as you might guess, some one clearly beat me to the punch! The film takes some bizarre, allegedly true events that occurred in the mid-60s in Point Pleasant, West Viriginia and updates the strange phenomena to present day using a somewhat fictionalized story.Richard Gere plays John Klein (a character that I assume is based on real life author John Keel), a Washington Post reporter whose wife dies of a brain tumor shortly after a bizarre, seemingly unexplainable car accident. After she dies, he finds pictures she drew during her final days, pictures of a bizarre looking winged creature with glowing red eyes.Flash forward two years. Klein is on his way to meet the governor of Virginia, when his car breaks down. He goes to get help (I won't reveal the creepy details of this sequence) and learns that he is nowhere near his destination. Rather, in the space of 90 minutes he has somehow managed to travel 400 miles to Point Pleasant, West Virginia. There he encounters Sgt. Connie Parker (played by Laura Linney), who tells him of the many strange going ons in the town...specifically, the accounts of a bizarre creature from witnesses who are by all accounts reputable. She shows him a sketch that one witness drew of the creature, and it is nearly identical to the bizarre drawings Klein's wife had done before her death.You can probably guess where the film is headed from this point; in fact, that's part of the beauty. Astute viewers will always be one step ahead of the characters onscreen, and one step behind...The Mothman, or just director Mark Pellington. Each is pretty damn good at scaring people.Pellington his his second feature, Arlington Road, a top notch thriller along the lines of Rosemary's Baby. Here he goes for a more Twilight Zone approach, with the did it really happen? factor of films like The Amityville Horror, Snuff, and Cannibal Holocaust thrown in for very, very good measure. Pellington has been gaining quite a bit of critical attention for this film, and rightfully so. If he keeps up, one can see Mark Pellington, Victor Salva, and Alejandro Amenbar doing for the horror\/thriller genre what John Carpenter, Wes Craven, and Dario Argento did for it in the 70s.Some critics have been apt to attack the film for its reliance on classic horror movie conventions...as if this is a bad thing. It's quite ironic, considering that it is the film's good old fashioned sensibility that makes the proceedings so overwhelmingly effective. It does not rely on cheap scares, post-PC gore, or loud sound effects to jolt its audience. The film's power is rooted in its fundamentally chilling story, and taken to another level thanks to Pellington's assured direction.

It's already a strong candidate for best horror film of 2002...and even as a hardcore genre fan, I'd have to put it on my list of favorite horror movies of all time.I had been fascinated by the Mothman myth since 1995, when I first read of its existence in a book of legends and folklore. Since then, I've often thought about making a horror film based on the story. And as you might guess, some one clearly beat me to the punch! The film takes some bizarre, allegedly true events that occurred in the mid-60s in Point Pleasant, West Viriginia and updates the strange phenomena to present day using a somewhat fictionalized story.Richard Gere plays John Klein (a character that I assume is based on real life author John Keel), a Washington Post reporter whose wife dies of a brain tumor shortly after a bizarre, seemingly unexplainable car accident. After she dies, he finds pictures she drew during her final days, pictures of a bizarre looking winged creature with glowing red eyes.Flash forward two years. Klein is on his way to meet the governor of Virginia, when his car breaks down. He goes to get help (I won't reveal the creepy details of this sequence) and learns that he is nowhere near his destination. Rather, in the space of 90 minutes he has somehow managed to travel 400 miles to Point Pleasant, West Virginia. There he encounters Sgt. Connie Parker (played by Laura Linney), who tells him of the many strange going ons in the town...specifically, the accounts of a bizarre creature from witnesses who are by all accounts reputable. She shows him a sketch that one witness drew of the creature, and it is nearly identical to the bizarre drawings Klein's wife had done before her death.You can probably guess where the film is headed from this point; in fact, that's part of the beauty. Astute viewers will always be one step ahead of the characters onscreen, and one step behind...The Mothman, or just director Mark Pellington. Each is pretty damn good at scaring people.Pellington his his second feature, Arlington Road, a top notch thriller along the lines of Rosemary's Baby. Here he goes for a more Twilight Zone approach, with the did it really happen? factor of films like The Amityville Horror, Snuff, and Cannibal Holocaust thrown in for very, very good measure. Pellington has been gaining quite a bit of critical attention for this film, and rightfully so. If he keeps up, one can see Mark Pellington, Victor Salva, and Alejandro Amenbar doing for the horror\/thriller genre what John Carpenter, Wes Craven, and Dario Argento did for it in the 70s.Some critics have been apt to attack the film for its reliance on classic horror movie conventions...as if this is a bad thing. It's quite ironic, considering that it is the film's good old fashioned sensibility that makes the proceedings so overwhelmingly effective. It does not rely on cheap scares, post-PC gore, or loud sound effects to jolt its audience. The film's power is rooted in its fundamentally chilling story, and taken to another level thanks to Pellington's assured direction.

Hell, unlike MOULON ROUGE, it at least had original songs, so it should have gotten some attention. Speaking of those songs, they are all fantastic, from the lovely and lyrically brilliant Origin of Love, to the raunchy Angry Inch, the exhillerating and uplifting Midnight Radio and the side-splittingly funny Wig In A Box. Of course, John Cameron Mitchell has much to do with this his performance and vocals are amazing, and while I liked Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman's performances, Mitchell and Miriam Shor win my vote for singing on-screen couple of the year. Stephen Trask (whose career as a composer\/lyricist is hopefully going to rocket to stardom after this), Andrea Martin and Alberta Watson all provide strong and memorable supporting performances, while Michael Pitt manages to be both vaguely annoying, in a Vincent Gallo\/Trent Reznor way, while still being oddly endearing and vulnerable- exactly what he needs to be. I've never seen the stage play so I have no idea how it compares, but the script moves beautiful from one stage of Hansel\/Hedwig's life to the next and the friendly, amiable manner in which it is shot and directed makes the film's strange characters totally relateable, their personal desires and agony very real and close to home. This movie is ultimatelty, in addition to being fun and full of good music, extremely powerful, both as a story of one man's long journey to finally accepting his own masculinity, and as an exploration of how music allows an individual to experiment with both self-concealment and self-revelation. The characters are beautifully 3 dimensional, and it ultimately provides that musical theater catharsis that MOULON ROUGE dropped in exchange for a schmaltzy, weepy ending too corny to be acceptable. It's a shame that the subject matter and lack of big stars will probably keep this movie in the cult and art house circuit, because it's some of the best and most exciting film making- and rock and roll- I've encountered in years.

The story is better than the first film's, although the twists don't work as well as they think they do.The main improvement since the first movie is that there's more fighting action.  In RH Jackie Chan's fighting was toned down to make room for Tucker's comedy.  In RH2 Chan is allowed to have much more action and the addition of Zhang Ziyi ups the ante all the more.  Tucker still gets to do his big-mouthed comedy and have plenty of banter between him and Chan, be sexual with girls and fight.  It's not breaking new ground but it's quite fun.Chan and Tucker are very good, mainly because they're having fun and comfortable with each other.  Lone adds class and menace as Ricky Tan and Sanchez adds spice as the beautiful Isabella.  The best addition is Zhang Ziyi - she doesn't have any character but she can certainly move!

The only problem is this - the funniest bits are the outtakes, shouldn't it have been in the film?! ","genre":"Action, Comedy, Crime"},{"date":"25 January 2002","score":"","review":"  This film isn't that hard to work out. Lynch simply employs a non-linear plot-line, and forgets to label which scenes are set when. If he had employed the old '2 months earlier' tactic to the screen, this film would lose a lot of its mystery. Once you work out the order in which the sequences occured realisticly, its simple.(Film's final third comes first) Diane was bascially a failure, failed actress (as she basically explaines at the table), tortured by her love for Camilla who mentally abuses her (teasing her in the studio in the car with the director etc).(Film's middle then happens) Diane approaches the hitman, with a bag full of money. Obviously, he is the one Diane pays to quence her jeaolusy, but killing Camilla.(Film's beginning, and first half, comes last) After Camilla has been killed, Diane goes to sleep and falls into a dream\/nightmare. That's why we see those glimpses of Diane asleep in the film's opening. All the happens after that, is Diane's nightmare. She sees herself as Betty, a beautiful, talented actress (which Diane never was). She fantasises about Camilla 'needing' Betty (Which Diane craved). Basically, she sees a life she dreamed of having. But slowly, Diane's dream is shattered as reality creeps back to haunt her. Finally Camilla opens the 'box', which represents the 'real world', and so wakes Diane out of her dream, into torment at how depressed a failure she has become, and a murdering one at that, and shoots herself.That's the basic story-line, with many small details included along the way. For instance, the key. The key is the instrument which will eventually resurface Diane's painful reality. It is the tool that opens the 'boxed up' reality. When the hitman hands Diane the key, she asks 'what does it open,' and he laughs. It's Lynch's way of telling her, that although you will kill the woman who treats you so badly, you will not be able to dream it away forever, eventually the key will be found, and you will have to face reality.The money 'Rita' has inside her bag during the dream? This is just like the bag of money Diane gave the hitman. Since Diane handed that money to ensure the death of Camilla, by having Rita now with the same money, it's as if Diane is confirming Camilla's desire to kill her. It's Diane's way of lessening her paranoia.This is substantiated when they see the 'dead woman'. Obviously, this carcass is representative of Diane. Upon seeing the body, Rita is much more shocked than Betty is, as if Betty knew it was there. This is Betty's way of showing Camilla how she metaphorically 'killed' her, by treating her so awfully in reality. It is Diane's subconscious desire to bring Camilla to be accountable.Anyway, there's too much to fit onto IMDB. But, I will say this film  is almost exactly like Lost highway in everything it's trying to say. A person commits a murder of someone they are jealous of, they try to block out reality by dreaming\/creating a new identity, but reality always forces them into torment. That's exactly what happens to Bill Pullman in Lost Highway. He killed his wife, created another personality to help cope with the guilt, but the 'Mystery Man' didn't let him escape reality.EXACTLY THE SAME IN MULHOLLAND DRiVE. Diane kills Camilla, tries to dream another identity, but the 'Cowboy' makes sure the Director picks another woman (also named Camilla), so as to wake Diane back up to reality (Camilla was always better than her, and she can't have this perfect dream.)In both movies, the 'Cowboy' and the 'Mystery Man' were representative of the 'truth', which haunted the main character.Lynch does employ some good techniques in the film. But for a die-hard fan, it all falls apart once you discover this film is simply 'Lost Highway', with the beginning and end switched around, simply with a different main character. With 'Lost Highway' it was original and revolutionary. With 'Mulholland Drive', it's childish and laughable. 'Lost Highway' for the masses and a bigger budget. If the ground hadn't been covered before, this film would be a master-piece. But why praise a director who simply traces his previous work, and colours it in differently?Plus, the non-linear plot-line isn't as difficult as Lynch hopes. Like I said, he just hasn't labeled when it takes place, and it's not hard to discover.Please, I hope Lynch comes up with something new next time. The one good thing about this movie, is getting the reaction from people who have never seen Lynch's work.
