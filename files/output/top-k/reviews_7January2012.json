[{"date":"7 January 2012","score":"0 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" Wow. Just... Wow. This movie is probably the best movie I've ever seen. I read some other 'positive' reviews on this to see if there are more people out there like me, but it seems nobody really got it and most people thought of it as a 'hilariously' (didn't see anything funny in the entire movie but OK) bad movie. Well, it's CLEAR you all missed out on what could have been one of THE best cinematic experiences of your life.The plot is one of sheer brilliance, it was adapted from a sci-fi book but no way a book could fairly display the emotion and impact the story brings us in this movie. It's an epic tale of oppression and rebellion, far exceeding the standards set by more mediocre flicks on this subject like Star Wars. This story binds us together as humans, as inhabitants of earth, it shows us that race and nationality are ultimately irrelevant issues and we should work together as one if we want to survive. Apart from the great moral it's still a breathtaking movie, with very clever dialogue, a passionate love interest and fast-paced action scenes which set Sonny Chiba to shame.The cinematography is mind-blowing. The SFX are so well done this movie could have come out last year and nobody would have noticed. And last but not least, the camera work and editing should be an example in film school. This part of the movie, if you have an eye for it, is especially good. The creativity in use of camera-angles, slow-motion and scene cutting is why I found the Star Wars films to be only mediocre in comparison.All in all definitely one of the best movies I've ever seen and I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys cinema on a higher level.
