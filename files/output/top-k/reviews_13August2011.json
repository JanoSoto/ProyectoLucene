Leading the dinosaurs is the little caring Kron (The Little Mermaid's Samuel E.

There is a point when they think they are not far away travelling through the desert, and they are desperate for water, and even though a way to get it is found digging and pressing the dry ground Aladar is still ignored. He finds himself attracted to same breed Kron's sister Neera (Ghost Ship's Julianna Margulies), and he has a few friends in the herd who listen to him, including Brachiosaurus - Baylene (Joan Plowright), Styracosaurus - Eema (Della Reese), and Ankylosaurus - Url. Aladar and his friends find themselves separated from the herd and end up resting in a cave, and they find out it is a passage into the nesting ground, but of course Kron again ignores them because he is so arrogant. In the end, after escaping the vicious Velociraptors and a Carnotaur, Kron dies, and Aladar is finally listened to, all the dinosaurs reach the valley in safety and live happily ever after, well, until their killed off. Also starring Alfre Woodard as Plio (lemur), Ossie Davis as Yar (lemur), Max Casella as Zini (lemur), Hayden Panettiere as Suri (lemur) and Peter Siragusa as Bruton (Iguanodon). The voice casting is fine, the animation is obviously very good, it is just let down very slightly by the story, it is very slightly dull and rather predictable, easy for the kids to enjoy though, an alright computer animated adventure.

Both times I didn't rate it much, if I was going to watch a Western, I wanted lots of gunfights and in this film there's only one. Having matured slightly&#x85; (Ok, a lot), and on several recommendations, I decided to give it another go. In the intervening time I did see, and like, a remake of this called Outland (1981) starring Sean Connery. But back to the original, I must admit I liked it a lot more than I thought I would. Yes, it is dated, but it's still a great piece of storytelling; it's about a man prepared to do the right thing despite the odds stacked against him. I will give my thoughts after this brief summary.Marshal Will Kane is getting married to his new bride, Amy, but even as the ceremony is taking place three men ride into town. These are bad men, men who ran with Frank Miller, a psychopath who Kane had put away several years earlier. For some reason, he has been pardoned and is due to arrive on the noon train. It's obvious to Kane that he has come for his revenge. He cannot arrest the men who have come to meet Miller, who include; Jack Colby and Frank's brother, Ben, as they have not committed any crime. In trying to raise a posse, Kane, surprisingly, meets a lot of resistance, even his deputy, Harvey Pell, is unwilling to face Miller. And even Kane's wife, a Quaker, is against him facing Miller but Kane is determined to see it through. As the clock ticks down to noon will he find an ally in a town that seems to have forgotten who cleaned up the streets and made it a fit place to live? Well it would be a major spoiler if I told you here and them Spoiler Police would throw me in Jail for 30 days.Even though it's in black and white, and in a 43 ratio, I still found this film very watchable. It's quite a compelling story and you really feel for the character of Will Kane. This is partly down to a great script and a really good performance from Gary Cooper as Kane. Also worthy of note were; Lloyd Bridges as the ambitious Deputy Marshal Harvey Pell, Katy Jurado as Helen Ram√≠rez, Grace Kelly as Amy Fowler Kane, Lon Chaney Jr. as Martin Howe, Harry Morgan as Sam Fuller, Ian MacDonald as Frank Miller and not forgetting, in his first ever big screen role, Lee Van Cleef as Jack Colby.Told in real time, it's quite an interesting and enthralling film. I found the excuses people came up with were beginning to wear a bit thin by the time Kane got to the church though. The constant refrain of the song by Dimitri Tiomkin I found an interesting hook and now I'll always associate the refrain Do not forsake me oh my darling with this film. Also the device of the clock, in almost every scene before the train arrives, there's a clock, reminding the audience that time is getting short. Over all, it's a really well made drama with some really good performances. I certainly enjoyed it a lot more than I expected&#x85; Recommended.My Score 8.4\/10.IMDb Score 8.3\/10 (39,425 votes when this review was written).Rotten Tomatoes Score 96\/100 (46 reviews counted when this review was written).

The people are very much connected with each other. The three friends Mike, Steve, and Nike were just about to go to Vietnam. But there were still wedding party and deer hunting to be done.

Along the way they were separated.The final part shows that even though all three survive the enemy captivity, there were parts of them that are dead. Steven became paralyzed and could not face the family at home and prefer to stay in the institution because it feels like vacation there with its Bingo and basketball playing.

Patriotism is often a label used to cover the absurdity of war. The deer symbolizes the innocence and beauty that Mike came to realize at the end. The activity of deer hunting itself shows the joy of men bonding together in a small traditional community.

I have loved it since I was a child, and I still watch it to this day. It is a family classic that teaches us not to grow up too quickly and reminds us all of the joys of childhood. However, caution should be exercised when allowing children to watch this movie. Though Peter Pan seems innocent enough at first glance, it contains sexist and patriarchal ideologies which can be damaging to children. In her textbook Critical Theory Today,&#x97;which is used in college classrooms across the nation&#x97;Lois Tyson writes Patriarchy is thus, by definition, sexist, which means it promotes the belief that women are innately inferior to men. Do we really want our children&#x97;or anyone&#x97;to adopt this belief? When the animated film came out in 1953 (and especially when the book was published in the early 1900's) these patriarchal views of traditional gender roles were the norm. Females were supposed to be submissive to males. If they were not, they were outcast and\/or reprimanded. Males were supposed to be the providers and protectors, and if they were unable to fulfill these roles they were considered failures. A lot has changed since then. We have gained new insight and understanding of gender roles. No girl should grow up believing that their only options in life are either that of wife and mother or b****and wh*re, and that if they violate a patriarchal norm&#x97;such as expressing their opinions or refusing to submit to a male&#x97;they are the latter. No boy should grow up believing that if he does not accept a risky challenge he is a failure, or if he displays feelings such as love, pain, or fear he is a coward or a sissy. Peter Pan leads children to adhere to these oppressive gender roles through the actions and results of its characters Peter Pan always gives the orders and expects them to be obeyed. Princess Tiger Lily and Tinkerbelle have no voice in any matter&#x97;figuratively and literally&#x97;they never speak! Tinkerbelle represents Peter Pan's significant other voiceless and submissive. When she attempts to express her concern over Peter Pan bringing home another girl (Wendy) he promptly banishes her. Peter Pan is the provider and the protector. He never backs down from a challenge, especially if his reputation is at risk (such as when Captain Hook lures him into a battle by calling him a coward). Peter Pan never shows fear and he never fails. He is portrayed as the hero. Captain Hook does show fear, for instance whenever the crocodile is present. He loses all of his battles with Peter Pan, and is then called a codfish because he is weak and helpless. Captain hook is portrayed as the antagonist, or the bad guy. The resulting implication for males is that strength, power and success at all endeavors = hero; Displays of emotion and unsuccessful attempts = failure and disappointment in all aspects of life. I do not mean to chase anyone off from this movie, but rather to provide a warning to viewers. Even if one does not know what feminist criticism is, or the meanings of sexist and patriarchal, it is still very possible to internalize the concepts subliminally, especially through appealing media, which Peter Pan certainly is. So by all means, watch this movie, but watch it with your and be prepared to follow up with a discussion.

When she attempts to express her concern over Peter Pan bringing home another girl (Wendy) he promptly banishes her. Peter Pan is the provider and the protector. He never backs down from a challenge, especially if his reputation is at risk (such as when Captain Hook lures him into a battle by calling him a coward). Peter Pan never shows fear and he never fails. He is portrayed as the hero. Captain Hook does show fear, for instance whenever the crocodile is present. He loses all of his battles with Peter Pan, and is then called a codfish because he is weak and helpless. Captain hook is portrayed as the antagonist, or the bad guy. The resulting implication for males is that strength, power and success at all endeavors = hero; Displays of emotion and unsuccessful attempts = failure and disappointment in all aspects of life. I do not mean to chase anyone off from this movie, but rather to provide a warning to viewers. Even if one does not know what feminist criticism is, or the meanings of sexist and patriarchal, it is still very possible to internalize the concepts subliminally, especially through appealing media, which Peter Pan certainly is. So by all means, watch this movie, but watch it with your and be prepared to follow up with a discussion.

Back in 2002, this one was the 'make or break' film that would propel Marvel into future projects if it was successful, and history bears out the results. I saw the picture when it came out, but wasn't writing these reviews back then, so I'm a little late to the party. But I have to say, watching it again some nine years later leaves me with some of the same feelings I had back then. I thought the condensed story of Spider-Man's origin was neatly done, along with the way Peter gradually learned to use his new found powers. By the time Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson) has his heart to heart talk with Peter and advises - Just be careful who you change into - we're already in on Peter's amazing secret with a sense that big things are ahead for the teen-age hero.One of the great kicks I get out of watching the Marvel franchise films is waiting to catch comic book writer and legend Stan Lee in one of his now ubiquitous appearances. Lee is seen in this one during the Green Goblin's attack on the Unity Day Festival when he pulls a young girl away from some falling debris. I was surprised today to see how quick that scene played out, so if you're not attentive you're bound to miss it. I see that Lee's appearance in the picture is uncredited as the 'Man in Fair', but a better clue to help pick him out would be 'Man who saves girl', but as I say, it was a pretty quick scene.The other great memory I had while watching the picture again today was the appearance of Randy 'Macho Man' Savage portraying the wrestler Bone Saw McGraw. Savage, who along with Ric Flair, was one of those pro wrestling villains that had a way of attracting a fan base because of his cool style. He displays his classic finishing move, the flying elbow drop off the top ropes on a hapless opponent before Peter enters the ring as the Human Spider. I was saddened to learn of his untimely and tragic death earlier this year, as he was a colorful character in his own right, and seemed to finally have found some measure of peace in his hectic life.Aside from the reminiscences, the picture itself is a nice balance of character development for the principal players, and action scenes involving Spider-Man and his chief nemesis, Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe). I have to admit, the Goblin get-up seemed cheesy to me, looking like a static green robot, especially when the eye-guards were in place. But hey, it's over and done with, so no sense quibbling now.So overall, I thought this was a pretty good and entertaining kick start to the Marvel Universe in cinema, and certainly for your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man.

And tits.Tits tits tits. Not banana teats, cow udders or raisins either, but perfectly-rounded, gently-sloped baseballs to cantaloupes. On women ivory-legged, flat-bellied, pear-buttocked, butter-smooth, hungry-lipped, not one a notch below 9. Call it art. Call it exploration of the dark side of the soul blah blah. Fact is, a magnificent portion of EYES WIDE SHUT is naked women. Simple. Kubrick clothes this prurience in the mantle of filmmaking, but isn't that how all artists score bitches (from rock stars to architects)? By couching their base intentions in seeming nobility? Yet, ironically, there can be nothing nobler than desiring to procreate, yet that too is cloaked in the bait-and-switch of family-raising.But back to the naked women... Who are they and what do they want with my willy? They are the licentious consorts at the exclusive sex mansion that Dr. Bill Harford (Tom Cruise) infiltrates and then finds he can't escape.You see, Harford and his wife Alice (Nicole Kidman) started speculating one night about their sexual fantasies and Harford discovers, to his chagrin, that hers are more exciting, detailed and likely to happen than his, which sets him on a libidinous quest to live lewd. No matter that the couple is happily married, have a daughter and successful jobs, let the blue-balled odyssey begin...After unfulfilling encounters on the tame side of filth, a chance meeting with a friend gets Harford the secret password to the ultra-exclusive sex club for the super-desensitized. Luckily, everyone at the ritual has to dress in masks and cloaks like they're reenacting a Mozart opera, so no one knows Harford is crashing their orgy. Until the cult leader calls him out by name and asks him the password to - exit...Cruise and Kidman reunite as an on screen couple - again (DAYS OF THUNDER 1990, FAR AND AWAY 1992), this time reportedly straining their real-life marriage with the hurtful residue of their brilliant performances.

","genre":"Crime, Drama"},{"date":"13 August 2011","score":"","review":" After watching Ace in the Hole, I can see why Billy Wilder wanted Kirk Douglas for the lead in Stalag 17 two years later. Both leads are thoroughly dislikable anti-heroes, but who are redeemed, barely, in the end. And after watching Douglas' performance here, it is apparent that Stalag 17 was written for him. But Ace in the Hole was not a box office success, so it is understandable that Douglas would not want to reprise both the role, and potentially the results, in his next film. You might say he was a little too successful at being hated. But almost everyone in the film is either dislikable or a bit pathetic, not a very cheerful reflection of humanity. Douglas' performance is absolutely electric; he projects onto the screen with great intensity. When you look at the chronology of his credits, this appears to be his first big leading role. Surely, producers understood his great talent from this performance, even if the public did not. But I guess he did not want to be typecast as a bad guy so early in his career and so passed on Stalag 17, even though William Holden won an Oscar for his performance. Wilder also apparently learned from Ace in the Hole that it was now the Fifties and the days of straight up film noir were over. So he added a large dose of humor to Stalag 17, almost too much, but the result was a big success, pretty amazing for a film about a German prisoner of war camp. As the film opened with Douglas in the Albuquerque newspaper office, I couldn't help but think of Groundhog Day. Douglas' cynical reaction to the sampler on the wall, Tell the Truth, and the woman's facial expression, reminded me of the scene in the bed and breakfast in Groundhog Day with Bill Murray as the cynical big city weatherman. You might say Groundhog Day was a humorous take on the idea of a big city journalist stuck in a hick town. If the measure of literary or cinematic art is to embody eternal truths, then Ace in the Hole qualifies as true art. I guess just about anyone can see how Ace in the Hole captures the spirit of so much of modern journalism, particularly the 24 hour satellite news overkill coverage of any sort of disaster or event, even on the weather channel. The word processing gear has changed, but the spirit of greed has not.

Both leads are thoroughly dislikable anti-heroes, but who are redeemed, barely, in the end. And after watching Douglas' performance here, it is apparent that Stalag 17 was written for him. But Ace in the Hole was not a box office success, so it is understandable that Douglas would not want to reprise both the role, and potentially the results, in his next film. You might say he was a little too successful at being hated. But almost everyone in the film is either dislikable or a bit pathetic, not a very cheerful reflection of humanity. Douglas' performance is absolutely electric; he projects onto the screen with great intensity. When you look at the chronology of his credits, this appears to be his first big leading role. Surely, producers understood his great talent from this performance, even if the public did not.

And if Star Wars represents to some movie experts from MY generation, the quintessential unsubstantial and money-maker blockbuster, I just invite them to reconsider their vision by imagining themselves in the movie theater, transported to a universe, never experienced before &#x85; A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away &#x85; a brief pause before resonates the fanfare of American Cinema's most iconic score, rightfully voted #1 by the American Film Institute, with the two magic words  Star Wars, in a no less iconic design. All these elements, followed by the prologue scrolling up the screen constitute the trademark of one of the greatest cinematic sagas, regardless of the quality of any sequel. John Williams' music plays like the celebration of imagination's triumph, of George Lucas's extraordinary creativity. In one minute, we're plunged into another dimension, indeed far, far away, and in no less than one hour, they're all here, the gentle and cowardly C3PO, the cute and childish R2D2, the courageous Princess Leia, the sinister Darth Vader, the idealistic Luke Skywalker, the wise Obi-Wan Kenobi and the coolest of all, Han Solo and his furry sidekick Chewbacca &#x85; probably the richest and most recognizable gallery of characters ever.The imagery, the costume design and the distinctions between the characters allow us to identify with any one of them, regarding their motives, their personal ambitions or their ultimate evolution. Indeed, even the most spectacular special effects and the most thrilling action would have been meaningless without the motives inhabiting the hearts of the characters, and without a meaning to this whole battle. And Lucas, besides being at the top of his game as a director is also one hell of a storyteller, for the choice to use space as the setting of a traditional battle between the good and the evil is a masterstroke, as it allowed the film to be a fantasy epic in the purest tradition of Japanese stories and medieval quests with a modern feel, an ambivalence perfectly conveyed by John Williams' score. By the way, I'm most thankful for Mr. Kurosawa for having inspired Lucas, with the legendary Hidden Fortress &#x85;And like The Hidden Fortress, the story works because the good guys are likable but not flawless  Leia acts like a mouthy little brat, Han Solo, acts and talks like a greedy mercenary and Luke exudes a naive idealism in his attitude. But beyond these facades, every character is absolutely endearing, on the top of them, Luke. Skywalker's evolution is the heart of the film, he embodies the fight between the good and the evil with an intensity that makes him one of the most romantic movies' heroes, and I mean romantic in the real meaning of the world  the spirit of an eternal, misunderstood, adolescent eager to change the world, even the score's tonality becomes strangely romantic in any scene featuring Luke. So, more than an epic fantasy, Star Wars is a coming of age story with all the elements that will trace in a conventional, but captivating way, the destiny of Luke, starting with the poignant relationship between the disciple and his mentor Obi-Wan, Alec Guinness who, in his Oscar-nominated performance, reinforced the seriousness of the film and provided a sense of quiet dignity. Otherwise, the movie would have been a bunch of kids fighting the forces of evil, Lucas needed an established icon to incarnate the forces of good, better known as the Force. As a religious allegory, the Force crystallizes any beliefs that inspire us and help us to fight the adversity and like a God-like presence, it's an abstraction characterized by its effect. Obi-Wan is the embodiment of the Force, as the gift that only belongs to Jedi knights &#x85; Beyond the metaphysical undertones that covers the brilliance of the script, Lucas knows how to tease the viewer, and create this desire to have more &#x85; So, I don't know if George Lucas anticipated making sequels while preparing the film, but this is certainly his most sincere one. He worked on the screenplay many years before coming with the final story and I'm sure he didn't think of the whole merchandising and pop-culture phenomenon that would come after. And maybe I kind of blame Star Wars for having paved the way to the blockbuster, basically the formula that couldn't fail  entertainment, memorable characters, great score, and almost guaranteed success. Movies would become synonyms of investments, big releases, and unless you were a known director, you couldn't afford to make an artistic film anymore. The film sealed the fate of the 'New Hollywood' era that started ten years before, a chapter was coming to end, opening the one featuring all the Superman, Indiana Jones, Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter &#x85;But Star Wars is unique &#x85; Adults were receptive to its depth, teenagers captivated by the story, kids loved the characters and everybody was thrilled by the spectacular special effects-driven action. Star Wars is cinematic entertainment at its best, because whatever came after, for the better or for worse, Star Wars is the number one.

I wish I could have seen the film with the same fascinated eyes that witnessed the inauguration of a whole new cinematic era. Star Wars would have meant probably more for me &#x85; However, I believe the purpose of a film's review is to be based on a minimum of objectivity, especially when it comes to the facts. You might appreciate or not Citizen Kane, but you can't deny the impact and influence it had on film-making. 2001 A Space Odyssey pushed the concept of Artistic film to an unreachable level of abstraction and perfectionism, but is not the most systematically praised film. And if Star Wars represents to some movie experts from MY generation, the quintessential unsubstantial and money-maker blockbuster, I just invite them to reconsider their vision by imagining themselves in the movie theater, transported to a universe, never experienced before &#x85; A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away &#x85; a brief pause before resonates the fanfare of American Cinema's most iconic score, rightfully voted #1 by the American Film Institute, with the two magic words  Star Wars, in a no less iconic design. All these elements, followed by the prologue scrolling up the screen constitute the trademark of one of the greatest cinematic sagas, regardless of the quality of any sequel. John Williams' music plays like the celebration of imagination's triumph, of George Lucas's extraordinary creativity. In one minute, we're plunged into another dimension, indeed far, far away, and in no less than one hour, they're all here, the gentle and cowardly C3PO, the cute and childish R2D2, the courageous Princess Leia, the sinister Darth Vader, the idealistic Luke Skywalker, the wise Obi-Wan Kenobi and the coolest of all, Han Solo and his furry sidekick Chewbacca &#x85; probably the richest and most recognizable gallery of characters ever.The imagery, the costume design and the distinctions between the characters allow us to identify with any one of them, regarding their motives, their personal ambitions or their ultimate evolution. Indeed, even the most spectacular special effects and the most thrilling action would have been meaningless without the motives inhabiting the hearts of the characters, and without a meaning to this whole battle.

The Celts are in the finals with the Utah Jazz and their star player selfish, ballhog Lewis Scott (Wayans). After losing game six, it's on to game seven where either the Celts or the Jazz will become the champions.

So they think they should show something for it, and hold Lewis till after game seven so the Celts have a good shot of winning. Their plan goes awry when the cad starts playing mind-games with the two in order to disassemble their longtime friendship.This is one of the comedies you have to search under the bed for.

The funniest stuff is from Damon though as he continues to play games with Mike's head saying that you're his bitch and consistently taunts him.

The current generation knows Apatow for making heartfelt, with an essence of raunch and silly comedy-drama premises. In the nineties, he was more about the laughs than the drama.

There's only one thing that's gonna do it for ya... No, not this movie - go dig out your record player and spin Rock And Roll Over.Appealing to the lowest of brows, the greatest of unwashed, the saltiest of the Earth, DETROIT ROCK CITY is a quaint enough road trip Psycho Circus with a few good gags, poorly executed - yet the whole exercise is about two decades late.Named after a classic KISS song (the marauding opener from 1976's Destroyer), movie follows four shiftless teens in 1978 on their quest across the American heartland to beg, borrow or steal their way into a KISS concert in Detroit.Edward Furlong, Sam Huntington, James DeBello and Giuseppe Andrews are KISS Army members (in a KISS tribute band called Mystery), who are unconvincing as KISS fans let alone as rockers, Huntington and Furlong the only ones casually nearing the condition of acting. They have four tickets that Huntington's Jesus freak mother burns, leaving them desperate, yet intent on making the concert.If you had Great Expectations for the film (co-produced by Gene Simmons and authorized by KISS - meaning authorized by Simmons and Stanley), then Love 'Em and Leave 'Em. Director Adam Rifkin seems able to construct good visual sequences, but doesn't go All The Way, opting for prosaic slapstick in place of comedy. Sounds like a case of... rock and roll pneumonia! We're gonna have to call out... the Doctor. The opening sequence is promising, as Rifkin gives us a montage of '70's iconography that places KISS in perspective with the times. It's powerful, it's heady, it's nostalgic - and ultimately the best part of the movie, which then goes downhill like a Baby Driver.The first KISS song we hear is the first cut of 1977's Love Gun, the frenetic I Stole Your Love, a few moments later, the first song on Side Two, the title track, over the montage.How do I know all this? Full disclosure didn't go near Google for this info; a deep, abiding knowledge of all things KISS since they decorated my bedroom walls and ceiling. But I never did scrounge up the incentive to send away for the membership paraphernalia because, as Gene's own philosophy about marriage sagely advises, if I really loved them, I didn't need a piece of paper or a jacket back-patch to Shout It Out Loud that I did.But enough about my laundry.Soundtrack is righteous '70's rock - UFO, Nugent, T-Rex, KISS, AC\/DC, Bowie, Sweet, Ramones - which gives a false impression of the film's quality, because though you feel that surge of bounteous rock stardom when you hear Lizzy's Breakout or Cheap Trick's Surrender, you're still watching THIS film.Paul Stanley To call it a KISS movie does it a disservice, because it does a disservice to the KISS fans, which is what it's really about. KISS don't appear in the film until the final few minutes - and then in an annoying composite of the renowned KISS stage antics (blood, smoking guitars, fire-breathing) within one song performance, Detroit Rock City, apparently the one and only song they're going to perform tonight, as they do their closing shtick after this song - drums rise, smash guitars, etc.The most bemusing factor of this 1999 incarnation of the band is that (except for Frehley) they look exactly like their 1978 Hooligan selves. And they've dressed the stage show in '78 lighted-stairs period, which gives us that nostalgic twitch. That's The Kind Of Sugar Papa Likes (there's a deep cut for you, fans!). We just grimace at the way director Rifkin handles the concert.I can't quite figure who this movie is aimed at. Actual fans would be turned off by the wholly unconvincing performances and na√Øvet√© of the filmmakers (film hits Rock Bottom when one of the guys sneaks in backstage by carrying a kick drum with a KISS logo amongst a group of roadies - I can't even begin to deconstruct the stupidity of this scene). Fence-sitting fans are not shown enough KISS to be convinced, just pummeled with the fanaticism of the fans (who all seem to be rednecks). On YouTube, it seems this movie's fan base are those who profess to be not into KISS, but like the movie anyway. There are chicks named Beth and Christine, which would mean something to even the most peripheral were-kisser. And Shannon Tweed (Playmate of the Year 1982, and Gene's squeeze) makes a cameo as a MILF hot for guys who've been pursued by Terminators and brought their pets back to life.Well, aw yeah!

KISS don't appear in the film until the final few minutes - and then in an annoying composite of the renowned KISS stage antics (blood, smoking guitars, fire-breathing) within one song performance, Detroit Rock City, apparently the one and only song they're going to perform tonight, as they do their closing shtick after this song - drums rise, smash guitars, etc.The most bemusing factor of this 1999 incarnation of the band is that (except for Frehley) they look exactly like their 1978 Hooligan selves. And they've dressed the stage show in '78 lighted-stairs period, which gives us that nostalgic twitch. That's The Kind Of Sugar Papa Likes (there's a deep cut for you, fans!). We just grimace at the way director Rifkin handles the concert.I can't quite figure who this movie is aimed at. Actual fans would be turned off by the wholly unconvincing performances and na√Øvet√© of the filmmakers (film hits Rock Bottom when one of the guys sneaks in backstage by carrying a kick drum with a KISS logo amongst a group of roadies - I can't even begin to deconstruct the stupidity of this scene). Fence-sitting fans are not shown enough KISS to be convinced, just pummeled with the fanaticism of the fans (who all seem to be rednecks). On YouTube, it seems this movie's fan base are those who profess to be not into KISS, but like the movie anyway. There are chicks named Beth and Christine, which would mean something to even the most peripheral were-kisser. And Shannon Tweed (Playmate of the Year 1982, and Gene's squeeze) makes a cameo as a MILF hot for guys who've been pursued by Terminators and brought their pets back to life.Well, aw yeah!

There's only one thing that's gonna do it for ya... No, not this movie - go dig out your record player and spin Rock And Roll Over.Appealing to the lowest of brows, the greatest of unwashed, the saltiest of the Earth, DETROIT ROCK CITY is a quaint enough road trip Psycho Circus with a few good gags, poorly executed - yet the whole exercise is about two decades late.Named after a classic KISS song (the marauding opener from 1976's Destroyer), movie follows four shiftless teens in 1978 on their quest across the American heartland to beg, borrow or steal their way into a KISS concert in Detroit.Edward Furlong, Sam Huntington, James DeBello and Giuseppe Andrews are KISS Army members (in a KISS tribute band called Mystery), who are unconvincing as KISS fans let alone as rockers, Huntington and Furlong the only ones casually nearing the condition of acting. They have four tickets that Huntington's Jesus freak mother burns, leaving them desperate, yet intent on making the concert.If you had Great Expectations for the film (co-produced by Gene Simmons and authorized by KISS - meaning authorized by Simmons and Stanley), then Love 'Em and Leave 'Em. Director Adam Rifkin seems able to construct good visual sequences, but doesn't go All The Way, opting for prosaic slapstick in place of comedy. Sounds like a case of... rock and roll pneumonia! We're gonna have to call out... the Doctor. The opening sequence is promising, as Rifkin gives us a montage of '70's iconography that places KISS in perspective with the times. It's powerful, it's heady, it's nostalgic - and ultimately the best part of the movie, which then goes downhill like a Baby Driver.The first KISS song we hear is the first cut of 1977's Love Gun, the frenetic I Stole Your Love, a few moments later, the first song on Side Two, the title track, over the montage.How do I know all this?

I do not read the original novel by Rick Moody; but I think the film is an appropriate adaptation of that novel. Every plot is very carefully drawn in the film. A master work by director Ang Lee that I will never forget. The movie is like a fact file of hundreds of truths of our daily life. Every character in the film is a part of us. The storm begins with Paul Hood (Tobey Maguire) reading Fantastic Four comic book in a late night empty frozen train. The movie is mostly about the relation between two neighboring families lives in a suburb town. The characters are very life-like that I suddenly feel everything is just happening in front of me. Ben Hood (Kevin Kline) is the father of two child Paul Hood (Tobey Maguire) and Wendy Hood (Christina Ricci). The irony is that both of the child are in their adolescent and their parents are unable to guide them at this stage. The same thing we can see in the Carver family. Janey Carver (Sigourney Weaver) and Jim Carver (Jamey Sheridan) have two boys Sandy Carver (Adam Hann-Byrd) and Mikey Carver (Elijah Wood). That very night all the guardians went for an ironical Key Party that make them funny and irresistible to control their basic instincts. And the children are children, they follow the way that showed by the society and misguided by their parents. Young Wendy (Christina Ricci) is a grown up girl of 14 and she is in her adolescent but her parents hardly care to guide her in proper way. Paul (Tobey Maguire) 18 years old boy successfully controls his lust inspired by reading Fantastic Four comic is very sentimental. Albeit Ben (Kevin Kline) his father tries to tell him about the duties of a gentleman but he fails to make him understand appropriately. Ben has a bitter relation with his wife Elena (Joan Allen) that comes as an opportunity to grow an extramarital relation with his next door neighbor Janey Carver (Sigourney Weaver). The ice storm changed everything in a single night. Janey leaves the party with a young man to fulfill lust and desire. In the lustful late night game played by all the mature men and women of the society where Ben acts like a fool and humiliated. Same night Jim Carver, Janey's husband and Elena Hood Ben's wife become out of control of their basic instinct. The film concluded in a poetic justice with a sacrifice of 14 years old Mikey Carver died in an accident in the ice storm night due to his careless parents. Next day Ben found the dead body. And Elena found her 14 years old daughter Wendy and young Caver boy Sandy (Adam Hann- Byrd) sleeping naked in Caver's house. Caver family lost their one son and Hood family realize that how much careless they are? In a particular scene of this movie carries a good lesson. One day Elena sees her daughter riding bicycle that reminds her own teenage years and next day she rides the bicycle and entered into a shopping mall and stole some products to enjoy her young age behavior but caught by the shop kipper and humiliated. The irony shows the young girl Wendy gets the same behavior like her mother. The movie is very practical and worth to watch.

It is based on Simon's semi-autobiographical 1985 play of the same name. It stars Matthew Broderick, Christopher Walken, Penelope Ann Miller, Corey Parker and Matt Mulhern. Music is by Georges Delerue and Bill Butler is the cinematographer.The second part of Neil Simon's Eugene Morris Jerome trilogy, the plot centres around Eugene's (Broderick) draft into the United States Army during the last year of World War II. Sent to training camp at Biloxi, Mississippi, Eugene is thrust in amongst people from all walks of life. Here he will not only learn about life, but also have it changed for him.Straight from the off I have to say that this has become one of my favourite films of all time. From the moment I first caught it back on release, where I only went to see it because it was written by the guy who wrote The Odd Couple, I have been humoured and charmed every year since without fail. On synopsis it seems to be yet another run of the mill coming of age picture, or just another tales from the boot camp time filler, but with Simon holding the pen and Nichols painting the narrative with careful nostalgic splendour, Biloxi Blues is much better than it's often given credit for. A film that is that rare old beast that strikes the right balance between laughter and sentiment. It was hard to believe these guys had mothers and fathers who were worried about them Although this is primarily Eugene's story, film is propelled by the bubbling concoction of a group dynamic. At training camp Eugene and the other lads have to face up to a number of challenges, not just growing up into men, but learning about bigots, bullies, homosexuals and intellectuals, all while under the borderline crazy command of Sergeant Merwin J. Toomey (Walken). They may all be different, from different backgrounds, but one thing binds them together, none of them want to be there! In other hands this group would have consisted of annoying stereotypes, but Simon and Nichols, courtesy of the writing and the garnering of acting performances, ensure this isn't the case. The audience isn't short changed with these characterisations because they are stripped down to being survivors by way of humour and naive honour. Thus it never feels false. I wasn't in on that Pearl Harbour thing One of America's most celebrated film critics said Biloxi Blues contains limp dialogue! That's something which I certainly can't begin to comprehend. For the film is an advertisement for witty retorts, where often responses are used as a survivalist tool, to de-heat a flare up or to hide nervousness. In this respect Biloxi Blues pays big on revisits, each time another little one-line gem registers where previously it had been missed, maybe because we are too focused on the airy sound track first time around? Or most likely because we are too lost in a Eugene or Toomey facial moment. One of the best passages in the story concerns a last week on Earth game the lads play, the writing is sharp, yet tender, funny, yet telling, it really is a case of laugh whilst being drawn into the frightening reality that these boys are a long way from home, and possibly soon to be fighting for their lives in some muddy trench. The cast are uniformly strong. Walken delivers one of his quintessential mania turns, marking Toomey out as being one click away from either sane or insane. Broderick holds court and narrates with earnest style, while Corey Parker is a revelation as intellectual Arnold Epstein, a guy who no matter how much he is persecuted by Toomey and the other rookies, refuses to be shaken and lose his principles. Miller and Park Overall get the two female roles of note, both memorable in short appearances, with the latter deliciously dry as a hooker with a heart. In the support there's macho mirth from Mulhern (stomach of a goat) and Markus Flanagan (he calls his mother Louise), homespun mystery from an excellent Michael Dolan, and wistful tunings from Casey Siemaszko as Don Carney (can anyone count on him?). The ending doesn't quite have the dramatic impact that many would expect, and there is indeed some mellow periods of tinted nostalgia that will have some viewers urging the pace to go faster.
