Why did I go see this in the cinema, have a fantastic, giddy time watching it, only to come out and have my enthusiasm be greeted by hoots of derision and worried looks? ''You *liked* Speed 2?!'' Um...yeah. Sorry. Can I have my medication now, please, nurse?I think Speed 2 Cruise Control is a misunderstood movie. I think people miss the point. I think some people think I'VE missed the point, as well as some of my marbles. Whichever of those it is, I think Speed 2 Cruise Control is a disaster movie homage on amphetamines. All the disaster movie staples are there; the imperilled citizens (although, unlike big bad daddy Speed, they feel more cartoonish and symbolic, as if we've seen this so many times that we have been allowed to fill in the blanks ourselves), the mass destruction of vehicles and buildings, imminent death, a lunatic adversary, and so on and so on. What makes this slightly unusual is the frenetic editing and high voltage images that infuriate most and I gormlessly salivate over. Well, I'm sorry, but if you don't like oil tankers vanishing in eye-popping, booming explosions and cruise ships sideswiping oil tankers, well that's your loss, sweetheart.The film's camerawork-as hyperactive and as restless as a energetic 10 yr old, and taking the same delight in destruction-is, admittedly, sometimes too much. Jan de Bont actually creates vivid, gripping visuals, but at times, it was just a tad TOO vivid, and I felt a bit giddy and sea sick. On the other hand, some of the visuals were awesome, especially the  shots of; Annie and Alex kissing underwater as a swarm of bubbles swirl around them in the ultra-blue water; the jaw dropping, one-shot oil tanker explosion at the end (CGI, wouldn't ya know-check out www.rythm.com to find out more!); and the one take in which the camera follows Annie and Alex along the deck, and then pulls back and back and BACK, until the cruise ship is seen sailing off into a red sunset. De Bont did a similar trick in the opening scene of The Hunt for Red October.Sandra and Jason had strong chemistry. I don't see the problem; Bullock is a total charmer, easy to empathise with and to like, and a real looker. Physically, Jason Patric looks better prepared for the role of akshun herow than Keanu (though slightly less charismatic and appealingly vulnerable), and besides, one is as pretty as the other, and Jason gets extra points for getting his shirt off. ;)I did miss the dark edge that Speed had (remember Helen going under the bus? ), but it was also good to see some little risks being taken with the characters, like the deaf 15 yr old girl who falls for Alex, and then offers herself up to him after he saves her from drowning.While Speed 2 doesn't have the same exhilarating sense of speed and lets -break-every-highway-code-rule-there-is-just-to-save-this-bus of Speed, it DOES have a sense of the sheer awe-inspiring mass of a 510 ft cruise ship plowing through the water, ripping up waves, boats, and, eventually, bricks and asphalt. Hence, what we have is not necessarily exciting, but certainly has a kick all of its own. With that in mind, it might be pertinent to point out that Speed 2 may have benefited from being a film all of its own, rather than a brother of the original, and I say this despite the genuine and successful efforts to keep the continuity between the two films going. Narrative joins well; tone doesn't. Mind you, Cruise Control is a rubbish title.
