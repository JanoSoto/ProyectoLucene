It was a bad bad bad book but he made a sick twisted movie of it and Jim Gillespie gave it a semi-surreal Santa Barbara\/As The World Turns kind of look using phony sets and lot of blue highlights and dark tones.But this sequel... it's unwatchable for two principal reasonsNumber one it's a useless sequel, NOTHING here is new and the main feeling you get watching this is deja-vu, if not boredom. Number two is that Trey Callaway's screenplay is horrible. It's an amateurish and barely coherent effort all the way. First of all we KNOW who is doing the killings the whole time and there is not even the slightest single effort at mystery.As for the directing Danny Cannon pretty much apes the look of the first film and flies on auto-pilot the whole time. No points there.Finally, there's the acting... ewww... Freddy Prinze was horrible in the first movie, sometimes looking like he had just read his lines off a teleprompter (no noticeable acting effort) and he continues this tradition here. Jennifer Love Hewitt was pretty good in the first one but she seems to have gotten worse the more she's done films.So here we have it, bad direction, bad writing and bad acting. A total mishmash not worth the two hours required to watch it. AVOID !

So, here goes  I did NOT like this movie!  I'm not saying that it's terrible, just that it didn't move me the way that it seems to have touched some people's lives.  The perpetually perplexed Keanu Reeves is Thomas aka Neo, an office grunt\/computer hacker who is recruited by the mysterious Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne)to free humanity from enslavement by machines.  It seems that the world that we are living in is all an illusion provided by free-thinking computers who are using people as batteries (Can I be an ENERGIZER?  They last longer).  The only thing standing between humanity and totally servitude are the Agents, led by the soulless Agent Smith (played by Hugo Weaving in a good performance).  Agents are the only ones who seem to have the ability to alter the reality around them, making them able to do fantastic things like dodge bullets and the like.  Neo is shown that he, too, can alter the world around him when Morpheus jumps from one roof to another a block away (to which Keanu gives his signature line  Whoa!).  He is then trained in hand-to-hand combat, spaceship-piloting and the use of high-calibre automatic firearms.      This seems to provide the film with its strong suit  Dazzling stunts and special effects.  However, I found the story to be just a little too pretentious.  I realize that there is a lot of symbolism within the story (most of it cribbed from the New Testament), but, while watching the movie and getting the messages of the movie, I half expected to see signposts appear saying CAUTION! METAPHORS AHEAD!  I did get a kick, however, out of the street intersections mentioned in the film where all of the exits were  They are actually streets in Chicago, the Wachowski brothers' (and my) hometown.  As I said before, the special effects and stuntwork are fabulous.  In fact, I thought the film should have received Oscar nominations for its Art Direction and Costumes.  Beyond that, I thought THE MATRIX was nothing more than the longest, most expensive GAP commercial ever made.  For a better handling of this type of material, I suggest two films that could be combined to make a better MATRIX  THE LAST DRAGON (for it's metaphysical message and martial arts action) and DARK CITY (for it's handling of a scary fantasy city under siege).

Mind blowing.  Completely fresh.  Sorry, but I just don't see it.  I'll start with the positives.  Ed Norton and Brad Pitt were excellent.  Pitt perfectly captures the super-cool, no attachments, nothing-to-lose attitude that so many young guys have before they get old and come back down to earth.  Norton is also perfect as the uptight, frustrated yuppie bored with life's vapidity.  Even Helena Bonham Carter, who I normally don't much care for, was okay in the generic girlfriend role.Now on to the negatives.  The story is just utterly preposterous.  Maybe even more so than Fincher's last absurd movie, The Game.  The movie really lost all believability when Fight Club turns into the cult, Project Mayhem.  Although it has a nice twist ending with the Pitt\/Norton dynamic, I couldn't buy that they could get legions of grown men to become such mindless, fanatical followers.  Pitt's charismatic, but not nearly charismatic to cover up the fact his philosophy is tired and his idea of subversion is nothing except vandalism and petty theft.  The movie has pretensions of making a statement about consumerism but I thought it made them pretty succintly with the intro where Norton describes his perfect condo, filled with things he really didn't need.  Everything else is overkill.  And the final big plan to blow up (I won't say what in case you haven't seen the movie yet) in order to level the world playing field is...well....pointless.  Just like The Game, Fincher takes some good parts and sews them into a tapestry of mediocrity.  I give it 6 out of 10.
