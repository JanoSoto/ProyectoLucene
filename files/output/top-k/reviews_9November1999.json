Every actor in this movie played an important role and gave brilliant performances. Particularly Bruce Willis in his first successful serious role, definitley his best and Toni Collete for a fantastic portrayal of a single mother.Now lets get into it... This is not a scary movie, the main issue here is the afterlife which would probably fall into a supernatural\/psychological drama. This movie is about one mans journey into the afterlife.As we begin the film, we see the final moments of Malcom Crowe's life. Note how his wife Anna and him communicate. When Vincent Grey actually enters the scene notice the striking physical resemblence to Cole Sear.Could they be the same person? It is possible, notice the voice simmalarity, of young vincent. This leads to a theory that Crowe's life is flashing before his eyes and has stopped at where Vincent  is a boy except his name is Cole yet they are the same person, however Crowe switches into the present every time he is with his wife. Which leads to questions like Who is the young man Anna is with? Is it a younger Malcom? Why does Anna give this young man a first edition book?Anyways back to the plot Crowe is confronted by a patient whom he has failed(Vincent\/Cole?) before giving the chance to help, the patient shoots him and then himself. The movie begins one year after the murders. Crowe is waiting for Cole, and he is reading  a file similar to Vincent's. Heres a question If Crowe has been dead for a year where did he get the file? How did he know about Cole?The film then journeys into the building of Crowe and Cole's relationship, the problems and triumphs Cole and Crowe have during the process and the frustrations and understandings Cole has with his Mum.Notice how no one ever notices Crowe, yet Cole does. Can Cole See this? Does Cole Know Crowe is a Ghost? Now here are some things to think about When Cole's Mum is looking at the photo's why is their no ghost's sprite when it shows the youngest picture of Cole? There are alot of first person views in Cole's house especially with his Mum,like she is being watched. These are all important but, pay attention to every scene Crowe is in and look at how he handles himself and how others handle him. He knows he is dead, he just forgets or wants to forget.Cole sees ghosts they scare him, Why doesnt Crowe scare him? Crowe helps Cole with his problem, by telling him to listen to the ghosts and they will go away. Cole does this and he infact helps one and it goes away(crosses into the afterlife) he realises that he has a gift and he shouldnt be scared. He then helps Crowe with his problem, even though Crowe was dead he didn't know how to communicate with his wife. That really is Cole's role in the movie except one bit How did Cole open so many drawers and cupboards so quickly? Did he infact do it? Why did the hand print appear then disappear afterwards?Where as for his mum she just wanted to understand her son, and when she finally did he solved a grief she had for years and no bond could have been greater than her new bond with her son.As for Crowe he is infact the main character, and the film is about him and how he helps a boy with a great gift that others dont understand, and how he deals with the fact he is dead.The ending is a twist when watched for the first time, but when watched more than once it shows infact that even though Cole said people don't know their dead they do know they just dont want to admit it. The final moment is one of great WARMTH, LOVE, LIGHT and LIFE. The words he says here show that he in fact knew he was dead, HE JUST HAD A HARD TIME COPING WITH IT. This is a film of the ages and makes us think about death and the afterlife the way it should be looked at, this will forever be a film that will constantly bring up new things and intrigue us forever.

Its style, is easiness, its truth permeates every shot, every inch of this movie. Simply, it is a masterpiece-perhaps the best horror movie ever made. The plot is fairly simple Josh, Heather, and Mike are film students making a documentary on the Blair Witch, a local legend in Burkittsville, Maryland. They begin by interviewing several locals, asking them their opinion of the Blair Witch. Before long, they are in the woods where the Blair Witch legend has it that the witch haunts. They shoot a few scenes and then head to a cemetery. Days pass, they don't find the cemetery, and realize that they are lost. Meanwhile, every night they are being scared to death by different odd instances it starts out with eerie rock poundings and escalates to screaming children&#133;and then worse. The ending does not provide any twist, but is exhilarating none the less. The writers and directors took an old rehashed idea (Witches are scary!), but turned it into an experience. By using handheld cameras, the movie takes you in as a participant. Along with Josh, Heather, and Mike, you too are lost. You become confused, frightened, and weary. One of the most amazing aspects of the movie is its character development. Most of the dialogue was ad-libbed, but the characters transform throughout the movie as the haunting Blair Witch experience eats away at them. From the start, Heather is who we identify most with. She narrates every thing she sees, we see, and what she hears, we hear. Josh seems to be the laid-back dude who will keep his cool no matter what happens. Mike is the most flappable. He is skeptical and jittery the moment they walk into the forest. As the Blair Witch begins haunting, there are many role reversals. Their very first scare, Mike won't even leave the tent. As time wears on, Josh loses it. A combination of his weariness, the ceaseless hiking, and the horrible nights finally get to Josh and he nearly gives up midday. Heather insists they keep going, but Mike wants to make sure they keep their sanity. Later, Heather bursts into tears. She is emotionally drained. Flipped-out Josh begins pointing the camera on Heather, and she blurts, It's all I have left. They aren't making a movie anymore; they need to keep it together. Through all this, Mike seems to unite them. Whenever a fight occurs or a nervous night wears on, Mike takes control to see that they are okay in the morning. By the last scene, Mike has taken command of the group from Heather, as he is the only one left who hasn't lost it. Some of the highlights of the movie include Mike's admission that he threw the map in the river and the ensuing fight, Heather's tear-filled confessional (which should go down as one of the most personal and truthful monologues in movie history), and the last scene in the spooky old house. A twist here and a twist there keep you on your toes. Still, the way that the movie was made make all the difference. You forget that this is a fake. It feels real. It is real. Where most horror movies work by keeping you on your toes, waiting for what will happen next, this film does the opposite. It utilizes the fear of the unknown. Every night, they know what is coming. They just wait. Day after day, and everything feels so lost and helpless. There is no way out. It is only a matter of time until the inevitable hits. The Shining, for instance, works by pitting good directly against evil. Nearly every suspenseful moment relies on the fear, Can he\/she get out of there in time? The Blair Witch Project has an element of the fear (Will they get out of the woods in time?) but that soon fades. Other questions are raised, such as Will it come back tonight? , Will we ever find our way out?, Who is chasing us?, and What will happen to us? The film works on multiple levels, as well as being an artistically beautiful vision carried out. It is, perhaps, the best picture of 1999. Heather Donahue's performance is particularly outstanding, while the creators-Eduardo Sanchez and David Myrick-deserve nominations for both script and directing. They took a leap into making a very experimental film, and came out on the other end with one of the most original and exciting movies of all time.

Its style, is easiness, its truth permeates every shot, every inch of this movie. Simply, it is a masterpiece-perhaps the best horror movie ever made. The plot is fairly simple Josh, Heather, and Mike are film students making a documentary on the Blair Witch, a local legend in Burkittsville, Maryland. They begin by interviewing several locals, asking them their opinion of the Blair Witch. Before long, they are in the woods where the Blair Witch legend has it that the witch haunts. They shoot a few scenes and then head to a cemetery. Days pass, they don't find the cemetery, and realize that they are lost. Meanwhile, every night they are being scared to death by different odd instances it starts out with eerie rock poundings and escalates to screaming children&#133;and then worse. The ending does not provide any twist, but is exhilarating none the less. The writers and directors took an old rehashed idea (Witches are scary!), but turned it into an experience. By using handheld cameras, the movie takes you in as a participant. Along with Josh, Heather, and Mike, you too are lost. You become confused, frightened, and weary. One of the most amazing aspects of the movie is its character development. Most of the dialogue was ad-libbed, but the characters transform throughout the movie as the haunting Blair Witch experience eats away at them. From the start, Heather is who we identify most with. She narrates every thing she sees, we see, and what she hears, we hear. Josh seems to be the laid-back dude who will keep his cool no matter what happens. Mike is the most flappable. He is skeptical and jittery the moment they walk into the forest. As the Blair Witch begins haunting, there are many role reversals. Their very first scare, Mike won't even leave the tent. As time wears on, Josh loses it. A combination of his weariness, the ceaseless hiking, and the horrible nights finally get to Josh and he nearly gives up midday. Heather insists they keep going, but Mike wants to make sure they keep their sanity. Later, Heather bursts into tears. She is emotionally drained. Flipped-out Josh begins pointing the camera on Heather, and she blurts, It's all I have left. They aren't making a movie anymore; they need to keep it together. Through all this, Mike seems to unite them. Whenever a fight occurs or a nervous night wears on, Mike takes control to see that they are okay in the morning. By the last scene, Mike has taken command of the group from Heather, as he is the only one left who hasn't lost it.

Miyazaki returns with his 11th animated feature movie back to the roots of Japanese storytelling and succeeds by weaving the elements of the modern Manga comics into an ancient plot around the fight between nature and mankind. It is only the third film of Myyazaki which deals with a traditional Japanese fairy tale, and it is his strongest adaptation so far. The story seems to be quiet simple. One day a demon approaches the small village in which the young warrior Ashitaka lives. In the very last minute he saves his people from the ranging Boar God who turned into a wandering dead - covered and eaten alive by worms - and is on a rampage to destroy all of mankind in his mad attempt to fight back the evil enemies who turned his homeland into a wasteland. The wise woman of Ashitaka' s village very soon discovers the reason for the Boar' s outrageous anger. A deformed iron bullitt was causing him inhuman pains. She asks her ancient stone oracle what to do, and finds out that Ashitaka, who was infected with a deadly disease, has to leave his home forever to meet his destiny far away. On the search for the homeland of the Boar he finally is confronted with Lady Eboshi' s iron manufactory which is truly a fortress against the forces of nature and an asylum for prostitutes and other outcasts of society. Lady Eboshi's ideal of a glorious industrial city for the formerly disrespected may be a good cause, but the means she uses to make her dream come true are almost devilish. It is her hunt for the head of the spirit of the forest which finally brings Ashitaka together with San. An orphan who was raised by the Wolf Goddess and who is now fighting on the side of the animals of the forest to free them from Lady Eboshi' s iron works.The summary of the plot reveals already the epic dimension of this symbolic tale and Miyazako tells it in beautifully detailed pictures which combine the classic traditions of Japanese water color painting with the colorful sketches of modern day Mangas. It also draws its spirit from classic Japanese Kabuki theater, in which a seemingly doomed anti-hero succeeds in surviving and altering his destiny. The personel of that theater is best laid out by the greedy monk Jigo, synchronized by Billy Bob Thornton, who at first saves Ashitaka's life, but in the end reveals himself as the true enemy of the forest gods. These gods themselves don't hide behind a unnatural mask. Even after the spirit of the forest lost his head he rather appears like an exploding volcano than any kind of western supermonster. Underlined by a hilarious soundtrack of composer Jo Hisaishi the director makes sure that even his younger audience gets the message of tolerance and peace between us man and the nature we live in. His hero Ashitaka is a perfect role model for the balance in understanding both sides of the coin - that nature needs to be untouched by man, in order to remain its purity and true spirit - and that men need to exploit the earth and its ressources, in order to build a better place to live within a basically hostile society. It is this struggle in which the Japanese people constantly are involved - the fight between traditionalism and modern industrialism  - that inspired this movie, and it is Miyazaki' s sensitivity and sensualism which finally translate this struggle into an universal story. Thereby, his humor is sometimes as crude as his way of presenting the battle scenes. More than one man gets his head or arm cut off and overall the explicite violence may disturb some of the audience who are only used to the harmonic and violence-free Disney cartoons. Still, even these scenes are centred very deeply within Japanese culture and do only help to create a real life feature film atmosphere. Almost nowhere within the 134 minutes the viewer has the impression of watching just an animated movie. The drama is as intense, the characters are as motivated and distinct as in any non-animated epic. Hopefully, Princess Mononoke will find its way around the whole globe, and hopefully Neil Gaiman' s carefully English adaptation with the voices of Billy Crudup as Ashitaka, Claire Danes as San\/Princess Mononoke, Minnie Driver as Lady Eboshi and Gillian Anderson as Wolf Goddess Moro will help to distribute this masterpiece of Japanese animation cinema also into such counties which rarely present Japanese movies.

One day a demon approaches the small village in which the young warrior Ashitaka lives. In the very last minute he saves his people from the ranging Boar God who turned into a wandering dead - covered and eaten alive by worms - and is on a rampage to destroy all of mankind in his mad attempt to fight back the evil enemies who turned his homeland into a wasteland. The wise woman of Ashitaka' s village very soon discovers the reason for the Boar' s outrageous anger. A deformed iron bullitt was causing him inhuman pains. She asks her ancient stone oracle what to do, and finds out that Ashitaka, who was infected with a deadly disease, has to leave his home forever to meet his destiny far away. On the search for the homeland of the Boar he finally is confronted with Lady Eboshi' s iron manufactory which is truly a fortress against the forces of nature and an asylum for prostitutes and other outcasts of society. Lady Eboshi's ideal of a glorious industrial city for the formerly disrespected may be a good cause, but the means she uses to make her dream come true are almost devilish. It is her hunt for the head of the spirit of the forest which finally brings Ashitaka together with San. An orphan who was raised by the Wolf Goddess and who is now fighting on the side of the animals of the forest to free them from Lady Eboshi' s iron works.The summary of the plot reveals already the epic dimension of this symbolic tale and Miyazako tells it in beautifully detailed pictures which combine the classic traditions of Japanese water color painting with the colorful sketches of modern day Mangas. It also draws its spirit from classic Japanese Kabuki theater, in which a seemingly doomed anti-hero succeeds in surviving and altering his destiny. The personel of that theater is best laid out by the greedy monk Jigo, synchronized by Billy Bob Thornton, who at first saves Ashitaka's life, but in the end reveals himself as the true enemy of the forest gods. These gods themselves don't hide behind a unnatural mask. Even after the spirit of the forest lost his head he rather appears like an exploding volcano than any kind of western supermonster. Underlined by a hilarious soundtrack of composer Jo Hisaishi the director makes sure that even his younger audience gets the message of tolerance and peace between us man and the nature we live in. His hero Ashitaka is a perfect role model for the balance in understanding both sides of the coin - that nature needs to be untouched by man, in order to remain its purity and true spirit - and that men need to exploit the earth and its ressources, in order to build a better place to live within a basically hostile society. It is this struggle in which the Japanese people constantly are involved - the fight between traditionalism and modern industrialism  - that inspired this movie, and it is Miyazaki' s sensitivity and sensualism which finally translate this struggle into an universal story. Thereby, his humor is sometimes as crude as his way of presenting the battle scenes. More than one man gets his head or arm cut off and overall the explicite violence may disturb some of the audience who are only used to the harmonic and violence-free Disney cartoons. Still, even these scenes are centred very deeply within Japanese culture and do only help to create a real life feature film atmosphere. Almost nowhere within the 134 minutes the viewer has the impression of watching just an animated movie. The drama is as intense, the characters are as motivated and distinct as in any non-animated epic. Hopefully, Princess Mononoke will find its way around the whole globe, and hopefully Neil Gaiman' s carefully English adaptation with the voices of Billy Crudup as Ashitaka, Claire Danes as San\/Princess Mononoke, Minnie Driver as Lady Eboshi and Gillian Anderson as Wolf Goddess Moro will help to distribute this masterpiece of Japanese animation cinema also into such counties which rarely present Japanese movies.

However, evil incantations are said and his fiancée becomes one of the living-impaired. He is forced to dispose of her and in the meantime is attacked by a powerful force that lives in the woods. For the better part of the film, the phantasm is never seen. We see through its eyes as it follows Ash knocking down trees or trying to break through doors. This is always a good approach to horror, because the fear of the unknown and not showing the specter right away is psychologically more terrifying. It is very effective and frugal for low-budget films. In most horror films the creature seems silly and the audience's fear is taken away.Later in the film, we get the superfluous humans who come to the cabin to find out what happened to dear-old archeologist dad.

The best Marx Brothers film by a street, because it's got the least fat (IE the 'love interest' isn't included, and the film's all the better for it), and the actual meat's the best.A Day at the Races has some classic scenes, like Groucho using the phone, a fake Southern accent  and a noisy electric fan to tie his stumbling but evil adversary up in  knots, and the traffic jam, to name just two. But there's the African-American spiritual singalong in the barn is five minutes (which feels like twenty five) of unrelieved embarrassment, supremely patronising if not out and out racist.Take me out to the Ball Game, from A Night at the Opera, has me in stitches every time I see it, and the scenes in the Speakeasy from Horsefeathers - Harpo ordering a Scotch, or the password shenanigans are also pretty special, and this is nowhere near all the good things in these films. But for sheer anarchic magnificence, it's Duck Soup every time.

This is Fulci's finest film, even better than Zombie.  None of his features even come close to the epic nature of this tale of a hotel built on one of the seven doorways to evil.  The film begins with a flashback to Louisiana, 1927, we see a angry mob (which includes screenwriter Dardano Sacchetti, and other familiar European horror filmmakers) storm the room of a rather nervous gentleman.  The mob accuses the man of witchcraft (You ungodly warlock!), and tear him apart with chains, pound railroad spikes into his arms, and melt his face off.  When I saw this during a midnight showing last year, the audience gasped at these scenes of unspeakable horror.  Cut to present day where horror goddess Katherine MacColl inherits this very same cursed hotel.  After several mysterious deaths taking place at her new property, she and her newfound doctor friend David Warbeck begin to suspect there is something not right.This film has an amazing nightmare-like quality to it that makes it seem even more twisted than it already is. Besides the great bizarre dialog (I warn you, when I get back, I'm gonna give an autopsy), and tons of grotesque horror killings, including an exploding head, acid poured on a woman's face, death by spiders, death by exploding glass, and three separate scenes of eyeball violence (my personal favorite). Combine that with a great soundtrack, wonderfully cheap effects, and a creepy atmosphere, you have the perfect Fulci film.  Plus there is a hilarious scene where Warbeck loads a gun backwards.  Recommend viewing, especially if you can see it in it's uncut version, preferably widescreen.

One person said that this movie had bad acting and bad special effects. Bad special effects!? I'm not a giant fan of this CGI stuff but if you think the effects in this movie are bad you're blind (see the bullet-time scene again). The acting was great except for Keanu Reeves, but give him a break - he tried his best.The flaws I saw were not that important to other people, but almost ruined it for me. The violence was totally unrealistic. When people get shot they bleed, and out of the all the people that are shot in this movie I only saw one person bleed. Now I'm not all into seeing people getting mutilated when they get shot in movies, but I thought that needed to be shown. The only other thing was the characters always spoke in metaphors which can get VERY annoying after a while. Other than that you have a high quality movie with great action sequences, good acting, excellent special effects, and a great (but unoriginal) plot. You'll have a great time watching this movie.My rating ***1\/2 stars out of **** ","genre":null},{"date":"9 November 1999","score":"","review":"  First of all I want to disagree with some other people's reviews on IMDb.
