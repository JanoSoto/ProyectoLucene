Dancer in the dark also has a director who is really trying to tell you a story and one which has good things to show. It also has the best formula for a movie.

What a terminally bad film this is. It starts off with a ropy, would-be Star Wars scrolling narration voiced by an uncredited female. This mystery lady sounds alternately drunk, not comprehending what she's saying, and like she's got a large cactus stuffed up her rectum. It doesn't get any better.The Power Rangers are the six blandest teenagers you'll ever meet, colour-coded so you can tell them apart. Here's an impossible task find a single personality among them. For some curious reason, whenever the Power Rangers do, well... anything at all ... they have to describe it to everyone. Activating power beam! yelps the token black girl as her helmet light comes on. Their one-liners are even worse Have a nice trip! See you next fall! one says as she yanks a villain off his feet. Who wrote the script, Oscar Wilde? The Rangers fly by what looks like a felt tip pen on the film &#150; and that's one of the more expensive effects. The budget seems to be as cheap as the direction is flat &#150; which is a lot. Okay, expense isn't the be all and end all of a movie, but one such as this demands it. There is nothing beyond the mindless zap-pow of the visuals to recommend it, meaning its sole purpose is flawed. Particularly risible is the we've really ran out of cash now CGI of the finale.This is the sort of film where feeble, not even remotely funny jokes are met with hearty laughter. It's like the years 1940-1994 never happened. The jarring exposition and lame would even a hyena raise a chuckle? humour do act as a refreshing change from the otherwise banal dialogue, however. There's not a single iota of originality in the whole thing. We get the death of a mentor scene, the quest, the resolution... all set to generic rock music. We also get the moral of the story, the strength of a person being within them, etc., etc. Paul Freeman tries to inject a little fun to proceedings as Ivan Ooze, though is let down by the witless script. That said, the words Oscar and Nomination were never heard around this movie.Other things that irritate me why is it when someone's dangling hundreds of feet in the air, someone always tells them to hang on? Like the person in question was considering letting go and falling to their death as an option before hearing such an adroit suggestion? In fact, this timely advice is said three times throughout the movie, showing how fundamentally lacking in ideas the dialogue editor was. Awful lines, clichés (You play with fire and you're gonna get burnt), the Rangers moving their arms every time they speak so you know which one's talking... the sort of kids that say only things like Whoo! Awesome! Aw-right! Way cool! Give me five! and Ooze's final defeat by a knee in the crotch seems inappropriate for a family film.Having said all this, the movie is probably great fun for it's target audience of pre-schoolers, and someone my age shouldn't be watching it in the first place. But don't you remember a time when children's films were made with at least some care or love for their craft? The Jungle Book, E.T., Willy Wonka... all children's films that have some appeal for adults, meaning Turbo, the inevitable Power Rangers sequel, would not be desirable to the bored grown-up who had to sit through this one. Power Rangers The Movie is just one long, joyless advert for action figures.Post-Script Seven years on, and maybe this review was a little like shooting fish in a barrel. Having been forced to sit through the vaguely better sequel (4\/10) then I can only conclude that I was in a snarky mood when I wrote this and that the world of the Power Rangers is just not meant for me.

Many people can't tell one Friday the 13th movie from another and that's always kinda peeved me, so let me start by saying if you're gonna watch any of these you should limit yourself to the first four, of which this is the worst.  But when you consider that there are nine+ of these movies that's not bad at all.Jason is alive in this one, and by that I mean he's not a bullet-proof, maggot-faced zombie who could take on 50 armed guys and not break a sweat.  I will always prefer this version of Jason to the latter, because every character actually has a CHANCE of beating him at his own game.  The main character in this one hands him the worst beating yet, and it's always entertaining to watch little Dana Kimmell fight the massive Richard Brooker and win time and time again.  She hits him with a shovel, a log, a knife, books, and an ax, and Jason really seems frustrated at his own inability to catch her.  The murders that lead up to the chase scene are hot-cold, ranging from the awesome handstand death to the very lame electrocute the hippie.So watch F13-3 and see Jason do his thing before he could take 100s of bullets, teleport, possess people and breathe underwater.  When the series granted him these super-powers it basically turned him from a mountain-man psychopath into some sort of alien, and it's a change for the worse.

The film contains tons of splattery action, and he-man butchering, but Scott incorporates his brilliance into it, with constant symbolism, and true care for Maximus. With this, we get some of the best thrills I can remember in the past 5 years out of Gladiator's action scenes. Scott also incorporates some great drama, with a compelling and sad scene at the end, a feel for the evil emperor, and the aura of the scenery and its surroundings. The acting, all I can say is...WOW! Russell Crowe, anyone who doesn't appreciate his acting talent should be taken out back and shot. He is amazing! Angry, ferocious, honorable, determined, and seriously p***ed off. Joaquin Phoenix is as good, and almost better. Evil, disgusting, repulsive, but you have sympathy for him, and sometimes he seems relatively normal. Oliver Reed is great, but sadly he died during the film's production. Connie Nielsen is also very good, and Richard Harris, in his small role, is worth praise. Ridley Scott, who is unfortunately getting a little old, directs this film very well, like I've mentioned before, and inserts provoking themes inside the action and angriness. Praise for him.

I liked the character developments, even if the science fiction was low budget.  Basically, the plot of the movie goes like this - it is 24 hours before Some bright object collides into the Earth. There is no more night, since the object is so bright.  The details of all that are never revealed, but the movie is more about the characters than the plot.

Hackman vs. Freeman, couldn't fail, right??? Indeed, this film does fail on almost every conceivable level, and afterwards you feel like you need to throw up. The horrendous subject matter (the rape and murder of 2 (very) young girls) is treated as if it's the most normal thing in the world, and is almost completely ignored in the course of this film. **Spoiler begins**The problem is mostly on the direction side. If there is a single point in this film, which is really doubtful, then it's the fact that under extreme circumstances (psychological pressure\/physical threat) a crime suspect can confess things he hasn't actually done. Then the audience has to ask itself this question- Why does Hackman's character confess the rape and murder of the 2 girls, something he has not done??? Stephen Hopkins fails to clarify his point, and instead he throws all the clichéd garbage at us unhappy marriage, prostitutes and the ambitious detective (Brad Pitt springs strangely to mind). And when Hackman's confession, complete with his admittance of craving for young girls, begins, all you can do is feeling very, very sick. **Spoiler ends**       Then there's the acting, which is painfully bad at times. Movie veterans like Freeman and Hackman are expected to deliver the goods, but they fail miserably. The whole thing feels forced, and the leads don't manage to convince up until the final reel, which is rather impressive. Then the whole Thomas Jane thing. He harms every scene he's in, and it sometimes feels as if the role was written specially for him, having won it in a poker game with the director or something. (Remember Salma Hayek in Wild Wild West???) Anyway, the writer has clearly found inspiration in Brad Pitt's character in Seven, with the only difference that Jane's character serves no purpose whatsoever, except being a burden for Hackman and Freeman to really flourish. One huge plus point, it has the be said, is a story telling effect I have never seen before. Almost the whole story takes place in one single room, but whenever Hackman tells his side of the story we cut to Freeman and Hackman discussing the action while the action actually takes place, as if Freeman was actually there at the time!!! This trick is used numerous times with often brilliant or hilarious effect.  (Do you not understand what I'm talking about? Watch the film and you will, it really has to be seen to be believed)Overall, I enjoyed this film because it keeps you guessing until the end, and there's pretty good acting here and there.

It's a shame, really, because I am one, but I hate them anyway.  I hate the mass-thinking system they use, where they all do and say and think the same things, while all thinking they're unique.  They all get drunk, they all have posters of Che Guevara on their walls, they all love Withnail and I.  That really put me off, but I'm happy I finally saw past my studentphobia and watched it, because it's a great, great movie with a depth that escapes most comedies.Richard E Grant gives a stunning performance as Withnail, making the most convincing drunk I've ever seen on screen.  Nicolas Cage won the Oscar for Leaving Las Vegas; Grant should have won two.  Comedy is often overlooked, but he is hilarious and manages to walk the line between being pompous and pathetic.  Withnail is one of the strongest and most memorable characters in movie history.  That may sound like an exaggeration, but when you think about it there really aren't many great characters.  There are great movies and great actors and great lines, but not many stand-out characters.  Withnail is one of the few.Richard E Grant is at the centre of the movie, and the few scenes without him are by far the least interesting.  But he is not the only great thing in this great film.  Bruce Robinson's script is unique and relentlessly funny.  There are so many quotable lines it's easy to understand why it has become a cult classic, although it would spoil too much to give them away here.  See it for yourself and hear them fresh, in context.The soundtrack is another high, with classic sixties songs played throughout to emphasise the period.  With George Harrison as executive producer, `While My Guitar Gently Weeps' stands out a mile, but it's one of his best songs so I'll let him off.The ending is suddenly sad, and while it might horrify the students who think they're the first people in the history of mankind to smoke dope, it has something of an anti-drugs message.  Until the last scene we assume Withnail is an out-of-work actor because he is a bad actor, but we come to realise that he is a great talent, and that alcohol and whatever else is in his bloodstream has robbed him of it.  Like Trainspotting, it is not so much against drugs as against addiction, seeing that it steals talent and takes over people's lives until they have nothing but the habit.  It is this scene that turned Withnail and I from a good comedy to a great movie.  Do your best to ignore its reputation and enjoy it for yourself.
