Sam Raimi is one of my favorite directors, a real talent with visual ingenuity and a penchant for silliness. With last holiday's bleak A SIMPLE PLAN, Raimi gave up his EVIL DEAD past and churned out the most satisfying dramatic thriller of last year. He is certainly growing by leaps and bounds as a storyteller, and his latest film, FOR LOVE OF THE GAME, is another surprise for those of us who are fans. A truly elegant, dashingly romantic, white-knuckled look at baseball and matters of the human heart, GAME represents what a true Hollywood soap opera should be, effective.Kevin Costner plays Billy Chapel, an aging pitcher for the Detroit Tigers heading for the mound for may be his last time ever. The team owner has sold the organization to a corporation and they have plans to trade Billy. His arm continues to fail him more every time he steps up to thrown. And to top it all off, Billy must deal with his tempestuous relationship with Jane, a woman he met by a broken down car on the side of the road five years ago and has yet to fully commit to. With all these thoughts swirling inside Billy's head, he unknowingly begins pitching a perfect game. Unable to keep his mind clear, Billy thinks back on his life during the game and considers the mistakes he has made and the people he has met.Told mostly in flashback, LOVE OF THE GAME is first and foremost a baseball movie. While being knocked for his recent professional choices (yeah, I liked THE POSTMAN, say what you will) Kevin Costner seems to have been crowned king of the baseball flicks. Ron Shelton's BULL DURHAM is pure genius, the best baseball film ever. FIELD OF DREAMS is more like GAME, both share a strong heartbeat and retaining a smart enthusiasm for the sport. Costner has been the glue that held both films together. He's always been a good actor, only reaching brilliance once (DURHAM). He has the rare charm the many actors forget to consider. While not technically proficient, Costner knows screen charisma well. GAME gives us a desperate Costner performance, one which lets the actor take his guard down for once. His Billy Chapel is a man used to success, yet unsure how to use it to his advantage. A man who can hardly imagine himself consumed by anything but baseball. It's a great performance from Costner. My only hope is that public opinion doesn't tarnish the acting for the paying crowd.Kelly Preston has the more troublesome task of shining brighter than Costner. A working actress for sometime now, this new film feels like the first time Preston is really acting. I enjoyed her supporting work in 1998's underrated JACK FROST, and GAME finally puts her front and center. She bounces effortlessly of Costner, and the two - while skittish at first - melt into a nice chemistry that packs more emotion than I expected. The loopy John C. Reilly (BOOGIE NIGHTS) and Jena Malone (STEPMOM) are also quite pleasant in small roles.Working with even more restraint than his SIMPLE PLAN, Raimi brings to the table his gift for camera placement and visual tenacity. The baseball scenes in GAME are very romantic, the title doesn't lie. A self-professed fanatic of baseball, Raimi's love of the game shows in each shot. With noted cinematographer John Bailey, the two create a pristine looking film. The stadium scenes are both frightening cinematic and realistic at the same time. The look of the film might not register with many people, but I couldn't help but to admire such attention to detail.Screenwriter Dana Stevens made quite an impression with her spare and warm CITY OF ANGELS remake. What she brings to GAME is the feeling of courtship that I enjoyed in Costner's last film MESSAGE IN A BOTTLE. Costner and Preston really show the genesis of a relationship, warts and all. The structure of flashback that Stevens uses to tell the story isn't as unfortunate as it sounds. It's all a rather nice mix of familiar baseball melodrama and a hearty dose of Hollywood soap opera. Stevens proves once again that she has a wonderful ear for romantic entanglements.Call me a sucker for the obvious, but FOR LOVE OF THE GAME really worked for me. I really was moved by the story and enjoyed all the nuances and quirks. This classy film might not have a hero with a chainsaw for a hand, a crispy scientist with a reliance on synthetic skin, or a quickdrawing Sharon Stone. What it does have is strong emotional resonance. A audience film that the mainstream will love and the arthouse will abhor. I'll take that any day.-------- 10\/10  ","genre":null},{"date":"12 September 1999","score":"46 out of 54 people found the following review useful","review":"  For Love Of The GameMaybe I'm looking at this film through rose colored glasses.

Was it the song by Simon and Garfunkel made popular by the film, or did the film entrench the song into popular culture? Who's to say either way? It's a matter of opinion, and it's irrelevant really. The fact is, it's a great song and a great movie and the two compliment each other like peanut butter and jelly, ham and swiss or May and December.This movie is for anyone who's ever wondered what they are going to do with their future, anyone who's been in love with someone their parents didn't approve of, or anyone who's had an affair with one of their parent's friends. Granted, not many will fall in the latter category, but it throws an interesting spin on the film.The film perfectly encapsulates and portrays the feelings of self-doubt, alienation, disenchantment and unwanted pressures and expectations for a twenty-something just out of college. Dustin Hoffman is the only person we can possibly imagine in the role of Benjamin as his imprint and superb acting makes this film a great one. As reflected on in an interview with Dustin Hoffman on the DVD, The Graduate at 25, his life changed after this film, propelling him into something of a superstar status as his incredible talent found wide recognition. When I saw Rushmore I had a similar feeling about young Jason Schwartzman in the lead role. For him, time will tell. Although Rushmore isn't the time tested success that The Graduate is, anyone who enjoyed Rushmore would likely enjoy The Graduate if they haven't already seen it. They are, however, distinctly different films.This comedy is something of a benchmark in many ways. Not many films of a comedic nature are so socially relevant and of such high quality that they make the A.F.I.'s top ten of all time. The film by many standards is more than just a contemporary comedy. It is quite possibly the best one ever made, given its widespread appeal.It is well shot with interesting sequences and hilarious segments that hold up against the test of time.

Still, no matter when you watch it, you can't help but like it and get something out of it, unless you have no heart at all or have an absolute, unshakeable hatred for movies like this.  Throughout the movie, you think George Bailey's a nice guy (James Stewart was great in the role).  You may get a little tired of the endless flashback scenes, but you'll undoubtedly not really be that bored, especially in the electrifying telephone scene with Donna Reed.  Once the flashbacks are dispensed with, you feel sorry for George as he begins a sudden downhill descent.  You hope (okay, you know) his lovable, bumbling guardian Angel Second Class will be able to talk sense into him by showing him what the world would be like had he not been born.  And then it all comes down to the scene where he almost goes crazy, runs back to the bridge and begs God to let him live again.  That is one of the most heart-wrenching scenes I've ever seen in movies; unless you're one of the above-mentioned people with no heart, there's no way you will be able to keep at least a couple of tears from falling.  You will almost certainly be pulled into the scene, right alongside George, begging God to let him live, too.  But if somehow you can prevent the tears from coming, then they'll immediatly come flowing when he runs back home rejoicing and yelling, Hello, Bedford Falls!  Yeah, it is what's come to be called Capracorn, but it's utterly genuine and very emotional.  The mood is masterfully orchestrated by Capra and masterfully performed by Stewart.  It's the most, well, wonderful way to close a movie.While that scene and the performance in it are the best things about the movie, that does not mean they're the only good things.  Donna Reed makes a great companion with Stewart (witness that telephone scene), Henry Travers is a pleasent diversion as his guardian angel, and Lionel Barrymore is wonderfully wicked as the devious Mr. Potter.  The whole film is pretty well-done.  Even though everything seems happy, you still do get a little sad knowing George gave up everything.  There is a dark edge to this film, especially when he contemplates suicide.  Nothing happy there at all, but still well-performed and genuinely sympathy-provoking.  While it may be at its best when viewed at Christmas, it's just as good any time of the year and should have a lot of meaning, especially to a depressed or bereaved person.  It's just as wonderful as you've heard, honestly.

It's just as wonderful as you've heard, honestly.

Some films - notably the first Lethal Weapon - manage to straddle the divide to good effect, but not this movie. The violence is gratuitous and far too graphic for comedy (both the opening and the climax are unsuitable for the weak of stomach), and the comedy is too broad for an action movie, as well as being forced. However, what really sinks this film is the lack of any plausible motivation for any character involved. For the first 15 minutes, Major Brynner seems to be the good guy, and Long the mad scientist; yet in jail Brynner is somehow transformed into an evil megalomaniac. This conversion is never justified in the film. Meanwhile, Long has supposedly suffered 10 years of terrible guilt over carelessly causing so many deaths in act 1 - but not so terrible that he has stopped developing the weapon responsible. Yet, we are supposed to regard him as the good guy - at least, one minor character gives us a tedious monologue on how wonderful he is. And then, 20 minutes into the movie he abruptly dies (not a spoiler - it's in the trailer), leaving Mason and Arlo (Ulrich and Gooding) to save the world. Confused? Apparently, so were the writers of this nonsense.Mason and Gooding's motivation for taking on this mission is never even remotely established. Arlo's excuse, that he is threatened with a gun, is discarded about 30 minutes later when Arlo says he knew Mason wouldn't shoot; and besides, what stopped him from handing over the keys to his van and exiting the story? Indeed, the dull scene in the boat where each tells his backstory, supposedly explaining his motivations, is easily the worst in the movie, highlighting the limited acting talents of both Ulrich and Gooding. Thus, as the film enters act 2, none of the characters introduced in act 1 is alive or recognizably the same person, and the protagonists have only just appeared. Midway through the movie, another key character, Colonel Vitelli, joins the chase. (Apparently the writers missed the class in Screenwriting 101 where you learn not to introduce key characters halfway through.) Vitelli apparently has a history with Brynner, but that seems to have finished up on the cutting room floor, leaving us with a bizarre scene in which Vitelli tells us that he knew all along it was Brynner (so what? that was never in doubt!) and Brynner again confuses us by laying justifiable claim to being the good guy (apparently, he was demoted for protecting civilians in Vietnam). The possibility that Vitelli might have pursued Mason and Arlo in the mistaken belief that they were the terrorists is thus introduced and disposed of in the space of minutes, neatly killing what might have been the only interesting complication in the progress of this story. Once Vitelli enters, the second half of the movie reprises the same idiotic chases and explosions of the first half, yet no obstacle is allowed to stand for more than a couple of minutes before our two young heroes dispose of it. As a result, the film never manages to achieve any sense of tension or jeopardy.The film is so riddled with plot holes, starting with a terrifyingly powerful doomsday weapon that can be stolen by 3 people simply by killing 4 guards, that they are hardly worth cataloguing; but it is the character holes, rather than the plot holes, that ultimately sink this movie.

It gets a little boring at times and drags a lot.  I even thought that some of the scenes weren't of any relevance to the story and could have been very well cut off without ruining the movie whatsoever.  The story revolves around how Jordan Benedict (Rock Hudson) meets Leslie Lynnton (Elizabeth Taylor) as he purchases a horse from her father at her house and then marries her.  What follows these events is simply the life Jordan and Leslie lead as they have children and all the other events surrounding a married couple's life.  Back in Texas, where Rock lives with his sister (Mercedes McCambridge), many things happen to Leslie and her husband.  First of all, Jordan's sister feels her brother's wife is taking the spot she had in his life.  She eventually passes away which leads to another story.  Jordan's sister left a big part of her land to one of her workers, Jett Rink (James Dean). The only problem is that Jordan does not appreciate Jett at all and naturally, this hate leads to many catastrophes including his daughter's desire to marry Jett.  James Dean is probably the best part of this movie.  As usual, he is very good and gives a strong performance.  The main aspect of the movie is Jordan's regard to racism and how he changes opinions about it.  The story is basically the life of an ordinary couple which isn't a thrilling theme to work on really. The directing by Stevens however, is very good, which is why he won an Oscar for it.  If you are a real movie-buff, then you should see it, but otherwise, watch something a little more entertaining and a little less boring like Stevens's first part of the trilogy and without a doubt the best, A place in the sun.

There is Carol (Christine Baranski) a thespian prone to overacting and on the verge of having to give up Hollywood for a life of bit parts in places like Edmonton.There is Dave (Jamie Kennedy), an air-headed hunk, whose flatness as an actor is exceeded only by his sense of self-importance.There is Slater (Kohl Sadduth), a felon who wants to be a cameraman but is valued mostly for his knack for stealing cars.All Bowfinger needs is a leading lady and a leading man.As it turns out getting the leading lady is easy.

The plot seems to expand over the whole movie which is completely ridiculous because it doesn't make the movie any suspenseful but instead, it makes it a lot slower in scenes where it could have been fast-paced.  Sure, the movie gains a little suspense after Jack Palance arrives but other than that, never.  Shane (Alan Ladd) comes to Van Heflin's house to help him and his friends defend themselves against the local bunch who claims to own all the people's territory and asks a lot of money for it.  However, the bunch also knows that Shane is a tough guy and that he isn't likely to back-away from these guys.  This is clear to them after he serves a severe beating to Ben Johnson who had been making a little too much fun of him.  So after that, the bunch calls in reinforcement.  Reinforcement is Jack Palance and he really is reinforcement.  So then Shane knows he will probably have a gunfight with Palance (which is how the movie ends).  Alan Ladd was a terrible choice as the main character.  He didn't have the required talent to play such a role.  However, Jack Palance is incredibly mean as his adversary.  He delivers an excellent performance.  The only other good part of this movie is Brandon De Wilde who, in his career debut, earned himself a nomination as best supporting-actor (so did Palance) and he deserved that nomination.  Shane was voted #69 by the AFI in their 100 all-time movies.  I don't think it should have even made the list.  It, isn't worth watching for anything else really than the last half-hour which is the half-hour with Jack Palance.

Both take place in wartime, but the Vienna of The Third Man is a cynical and no-nonsense world of post-war recovery.  Casablanca gives us romantic hope, The Third Man gives earthly despair.  But everything from the black and white frames to the blatantly melodious music to the brilliant cast (Joseph Cotten, Trevor Howard, Alida Valli, and Orson Welles) and direction suggest that portraying the hard knocks of reality may be comforting too.  The Third Man is foremost a film about catching a scoundrel but the telling of this tale is far more interesting from the imaginative cinematography of shadows and slants and quick takes of ordinary people to the playfulness of this quirky story by novelist Graham Greene.  How can you throw in odd pieces like a parrot, a finicky cat, and a little boy who just wants someone to play ball with him and make it an integral part of a film?  How can mispronounced or misnamed characters bring out laughter at the most inappropriate times?  How ever in the world can such lines like &#145;any friend of Harry's is a friend of mine', &#145;you ought to find a girl of your own', &#145;all the Swiss have to show for their 500 years of democracy is a cuckoo clock?', and &#145;be sensible Martins &#133; I haven't got a sensible name' have such powerful suggestions.   In the hands of a master like Carol Reed, The Third Man is a film without redundancy and without unnecessary action nor dialogue.  It is slim and it is trim.  As an example, the mysterious Harry Lime doesn't show up until the last half of the film but his subsequent appearances are so anticipated and his character so dominating you feel you have experienced him much more.  Casablanca gave us the famous last scene at the airport and The Third Man is equal to that with the haunting walk from the cemetery.  It is a pleasure to see The Third Man and to see how far films have to go to match this film's superior cast and direction.
