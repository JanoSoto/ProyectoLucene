I mean, come on... look at the guy's life! He was a writer at Rolling Stone when he was a teenager! He went around touring with rock bands when rock was COOL! He knew Lester Bangs! He wrote the book Fast Times at Ridgemont High after going undercover, pretending to be a high school kid when he was in his 20s! He married the blonde chick from Heart! What is NOT to hate about the guy? He has led a charmed life, too good to be believed! That is sort of the problem I have with this movie... his own personal recollection of what is what like to be young and in the midst of great things in the early-to-mid-70s... it all seems too good to be believed. Even though the fictitious rock stars depicted in this movie have their problems they still seem way too cute and cuddly. The groupies are way too sweet and wholesome. Even Lester Bangs seems to be a cleaned-up, white-washed version of himself. I don't believe this cleaned-up fairy tale version of the 70s for one second. And yet... somehow Cameron Crowe makes it seem almost real. I really want to hate him for making me go against what I believe and accepting HIS version of the way things were... but I can't. He has a movie-making GIFT and it can't be denied. The best scene from this movie isn't even IN the movie. It's a bonus deleted scene on the official bootleg DVD of the director's cut version of the movie dubbed Untitled (Crowe's preferred name for the film). This scene is not in the movie because Led Zeppelin wouldn't give him the rights to use Stairway To Heaven. They can't even use the song on the DVD! What you have to do is, you have to play your own copy of the song at the right point during the scene (the DVD tells you when)... and then sit back and watch 8 minutes and 22 seconds of movie magic trying to convince his mother of the validity of rock music as an artform, young William (Patrick Fugit) and a group of friends and teachers play Stairway to Heaven in its entirety... reacting to every note and nuance in an extraordinarily choreographed scene that makes you FEEL the song the way THEY feel it. Even if, like me, you are sick to death of that overplayed and overrated piece of 70s lite rock, you can't help but be mesmerized by the way Crowe presents it here. I never thought it would be possible for me to listen to and enjoy Stairway to Heaven ever again! See? THAT's why I want to hate Cameron Crowe!

Then the gardner disappears too. Then an innocent black woman who is a friend disappears.With each incident, the comfortable family-oriented bourgois teacher becomes more involved in the awful injustices inflicted on black civilians, activists or just suspected activists. He first asks some friends in the government to help out and is treated with empty reassurances and pats on the back. Then he brings suit against the government's Special Action Squad (or whatever the death squad is called) for the gardener's death. The gardener was clearly tortured and then murdered under the supervision of the Chief Minister of Villainy (Jurgen Prochnow) and Southerland hires a lawyer who was disillusioned long ago (Marlon Brando).But Southerland pushes too far. His friends ignore him. He loses his job and his son is expelled from the school. His wife wants things the way they always have been -- nice compliant kaffirs who serve dinner when you tinkle the little bell, and sense of security. His wife leaves him, taking their adolescent daughter who feels the same way she does. Southerland's son, who seems to have inherited his Dad's ears, insists on staying with him and observes all the goings on. Susan Sarandon is a reporter who is sympathetic but has seen it all before. In the end, Southerland loses everything, but, as Sarandon tells him, despite his own helplessness, his son has learned a good deal and represents the next generation.The performances are all fine. Southerland is subdued and thoughtful in a role which calls for exactly those characteristics. Marlon Brando is also a standout, bringing to the part a kind of amused disdain for Southerland's naivete. Prochnow is properly villainous without being entirely unreasonable. He does his best with an Afrikaans accent -- nobody has ever trilled his r's so thoroughly -- but he may have been miscast because he looks like such a nice guy. I don't mean that the villain has to look like a scuzzbag, but that he should have an appearance and demeanor that projects villainy and what Prochnow projects is more like Carl Roger's unconditional regard. But, beyond the incidents presented in this particular movie, I wonder what the function of such a story is. The first response of any sensitive viewer is undoubtedly going to be white guilt or black self pity. It's ironic because almost the entire population of viewers, regardless of race, color, or creed, will have had absolutely nothing to do with the events we see.Personally, we will be gripped by the exposition of such injustice -- such outright murder by the authorities -- and that's fine as far as it goes. Beyond that, the movie-makers have given us an educational documentary-style film, beginning with a naive complacent white guy, a lot like many of the rest of us, and guiding him through a tour of corrupt racism, along with the viewer. (How he could have remained so innocent without having lived in a cave isn't explained.) I wonder in the long run if movies like this (and Z and dozens of others) don't have counter-productive properties. We feel not only sympathy but anger. In the final shot -- and I do mean shot -- the movie seems to endorse the idea that violence is the only appropriate response to injustice. Why should such a notion be expected to do anything other than drive a deeper wedge between minorities and the dominant majority? Is murder really the only way out of inequity? If they kill us, is our only response to kill them too? A more object lesson might be that colonialism doesn't work for long, but a lot of viewers may not be able to get past the violence on screen. And anyway, colonialism never calls itself colonialism. It's always The Crusades, or spreading civilization, or protecting our own interests, or preventing the spread of (fill in the blank with your own noxious ideology).There's a semi-happy ending.

But I'll try.Everyone knows there are Three stories. I've always said four. But it's basically about shady people doing shady things. Any other information would be too in depth, and the movie should be seen with no prior knowledge beyond what's above.I saw this movie clean on my fourteenth birthday. Two days after the films release. As soon as I came out of the theater I knew it was the one. The movie that would hold a place in my heart as the greatest I've ever seen. It still holds that title to this day for me. Everything in it works. The Characters are legendary thanks in part to the brilliant script by Quentin Tarantino. That doesn't even begin to do justice to just how well written this script is. The dialogue is the best you'll ever hear. And I will stand by that statement until the end of time. The characters, like I said, are all pitch perfect. Their concerns, actions, and moments of thought all are ingenious and yes, very originally displayed.But one thing that gets the short end of the stick in this film is the directing. While I feel it is Tarantino's second best directorial effort (Kill Bill Vol. 2 being the incredible first, in directing only, Pulp Fiction was the better film by far), this movie shows a directorial awareness not usual found in inexperience writer directors. The scene of Lance and the over dose was a Masterstroke. For example, the way the camera holds on the room, where Lance is digging for his little black medical book. The camera holds on the room, but not on Lance. We (the audience) are outside and can't see him, but can see in parts of the room. The way Mr. Tarantino never cuts away, never looks away, and just holds that one shot of a cluttered room, builds the suspense. We hear Vincent and Trudy speaking in the background, but Quentin holds his one shot. Simply amazing.Through the years to follow there have been countless imitations of this amazing picture, too many to start naming, but none have ever caught a glisten of what Mr. Tarantino did here. All those directors wanted to be the next big thing in Hollywood, the next crossover sensation r from Indie into Mainstream. None came close. This movie had something the world had never seen before. A pure breathe of fresh air, that most embrace, and many loved. This was at the front of the Miramax wave of sensation, and with out this crown jewel, who knows where they would be today. But this is the kind of movie that gets people excited, that gets them talking, and had the whole country buzzing. Something I wish would happen again to a great film. (I know movies like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, My Big Fat Greek Wedding, and The Passion of the Christ had everyone talking, but I don't consider those great movies at all) I am truly proud to call this my favorite movie of all time. I hope Mr. Tarantino keeps his flawless resume flawless, and continues to turn out consistently brilliant work.

But though these memorable instances attempt to cajole us into admiration during the viewing, the overall product beckons us to reexamine our initial wooing. There are a few other moments of atmospheric success, and Fontaine's initial arrival and exploration of Manderlay and its characters is interesting, but otherwise, the film is often mediocre, and sometimes even poor. Laurence Olivier is very stale and does not exude much of a presence, nor a riveting sense of charm. Fontaine is better, but her character is completely over-the-top. She seems well adjusted and interesting at first, then does nothing but shake and stand with lost eyes for the rest of the film. I know the situation is supposed to bring about such behavior, but it is just too much. The chemistry between the two characters is horrible. Perhaps that is supposed to demonstrate the awkwardness in their relationship. But, then we find de Winter really does love her, and he hates his dead wife. So while his madness translates well, his supposed love for her never does. Not even at the end. And hers for him feels impossible to get our heads around, since he never does anything but be rich and handsome to impress her. I know, I know, those are the dynamics of the relationship, and some of them are more subtle (e.g. de Winter probably goes for her because she seems sexually tame and timidly obsequious), but it still does not feel right in the end. The characters' actions are too shortsighted for the overall plot.The film often has no momentum, and drags on forever. The entire opening courtship can be eliminated since it is not efficacious in convincing us of much romance anyway. Then there is the second part, where Fontaine slowly learns the secrets of Manderlay, and though this probably is the best part of the film, it still never feels like it is building to a climax, even though every scene attempts to convey a bit of foreboding intrigue. Instead, it becomes monotonous; precisely because every scene is exactly the same. The end feels like it should approach soon after Danvers diabolical rant. Then there is Olivier's admission, and it feels like it should come again. But again it doesn't, and when the ending finally does come, it is of such an enormous magnitude that it feels too brief.Then there is the story, which I believe has a couple of plot holes, and realistic dilemmas, though I cannot say with absolute certainty. The film has a chance, but not without a reassessment of the script. Another chance at astonishing greatness blown.

But though these memorable instances attempt to cajole us into admiration during the viewing, the overall product beckons us to reexamine our initial wooing. There are a few other moments of atmospheric success, and Fontaine's initial arrival and exploration of Manderlay and its characters is interesting, but otherwise, the film is often mediocre, and sometimes even poor. Laurence Olivier is very stale and does not exude much of a presence, nor a riveting sense of charm. Fontaine is better, but her character is completely over-the-top. She seems well adjusted and interesting at first, then does nothing but shake and stand with lost eyes for the rest of the film. I know the situation is supposed to bring about such behavior, but it is just too much. The chemistry between the two characters is horrible. Perhaps that is supposed to demonstrate the awkwardness in their relationship. But, then we find de Winter really does love her, and he hates his dead wife. So while his madness translates well, his supposed love for her never does. Not even at the end. And hers for him feels impossible to get our heads around, since he never does anything but be rich and handsome to impress her. I know, I know, those are the dynamics of the relationship, and some of them are more subtle (e.g. de Winter probably goes for her because she seems sexually tame and timidly obsequious), but it still does not feel right in the end. The characters' actions are too shortsighted for the overall plot.The film often has no momentum, and drags on forever. The entire opening courtship can be eliminated since it is not efficacious in convincing us of much romance anyway. Then there is the second part, where Fontaine slowly learns the secrets of Manderlay, and though this probably is the best part of the film, it still never feels like it is building to a climax, even though every scene attempts to convey a bit of foreboding intrigue. Instead, it becomes monotonous; precisely because every scene is exactly the same. The end feels like it should approach soon after Danvers diabolical rant. Then there is Olivier's admission, and it feels like it should come again.

If you like quiet, moody, thoughtful horror which casts blood aside in favor of a genuine feeling of dread, then Wendigo is for you.Thoughtful, stressed out George, his psychoanalyst wife Kim and their young son Miles are heading out to the snowy countryside for a long weekend vacation away from the city. On the way up, George hits a stag with his car. The hunters who had been pursuing the deer are not thrilled when they find that George has ended their chase. In particular, deranged hunter Otis takes it personally. He follows the family to their vacation home, making sure they see him. He spies on George and Kim as they have sex. He fires through their windows with his rifle when they aren't home, letting them discover the ominous holes in their windows and walls when they return. When Kim takes Miles to the drugstore in town, Miles is attracted to a small sculpture in a display case, carved to resemble a man with the head of a stag. A Native American man tells Miles that this is the Wendigo, a spirit of the woods who has a taste for flesh and is always hungry. Miles takes the figure home with him, already haunted by the death of the deer the day before. That afternoon, when he and his father go sledding, George is shot and Miles pursued through the woods by a creature barely glimpsed...or is he just in shock, and imagining the whole thing? Hours later, George is rushed to the hospital and Miles, still clutching his statue, either faints, dreams or goes on a vision quest, in which the Wendigo returns. This time the angry, flesh eating god - part tree, part stag and part man - is hunting for Otis, who has finally gone over the edge.Wendigo is a beautifully made film, almost totally silent but for the wind howling through the snow covered trees. Okay, so the monster itself is kind of fakey-looking, but it's a small flaw, more than made up for by the genuine feeling of tension and dread that creeps through every frame of the film, and the eerie backdrop of the silent, snowy countryside. The performances are great, particularly by Jake Weber as the moody and thoughtful George and Patricia Clarkson as his sweet but no-nonsense wife. They are a happy couple with their share of common problems, and it is the strength of their relationship and their love for each other that makes this film powerful. Watching this film is often like watching someone's home videos, so realistic are the performances. This movie is not for everyone. A lot of people may find themselves totally bored, waiting for the hideous Lovecraftian Beast and bloody revenge that never come. We can never really be sure if the Wendigo even exists, seen as it is through the eyes of a sensitive child and also, later, through the eyes of a madman. This is more a psychological drama than a horror film, but it has more than enough creepy elements in it to satisfy fans of subtle horror.

You see, the first time I watched this great film, there was this wonderful fantasy style track with a beautiful hook in it that linked Jacques,the dolphins, and the viewers together. This track quickly prompted me to go out and buy the soundtrack, but To my disappointment, that particular track was missing! This was the joyous music used when Jacques swam and connected with the dolphins. Back in the early 90's, and as a former DJ who still makes mixed CD's,...I loved the track so much I wanted to include it in one of my mixes. I did actually,...but ended up having to cue the track up LIVE from a VHS tape while my audio cassette master was rolling. It was difficult with the timing issue, and I remember my VHS deck only put out mono...so the mix ultimately suffered! ...It was much later that I realized the whole soundtrack was entirely different all together. OK! The name of the CD matches the movie, but we have a different composer, - Eric Serra. This was confusing! As a film & video director now myself, I could not understand why they would have switched composers. For awhile I thought there might have been a breach of contract or some kind of falling out or something. Still...this puzzles me today! This reminds me of a version of Blade Runner (My all time Favorite!) I saw in Los Angeles which had one word switched. Roy Batty walks into Tyrell's place looking for answers. Most version's the public is used to seeing, we hear the line... I want more life&#133;FU**ER.... But a special viewing at the Santa Monica; Numark theatre, I saw a version where Roy Batty walks into focus and say's...I want more life...FATHER &#133;It blew me away!...It made sense!...I can only imagine some studio exec in need of some ego deflation, stepped in with The Big decision on that one.

Why would the credit on the film have Bill Conti, and the CD soundtrack have Eric Serra's?...and for the longest time, I didn't here anything about the original Le Grand bleu version on VHS! ...Alot of times, directors will re-release their ultimate version once their film reaches a demand and\/or a cult type following. By this time they probably have the chip's to finance it themselves. I realized since then, the existence of two films and finally after seeing the original, (or longer) version on DVD and reading the submissions here in IMDb, ...the knowledge of a US version verses a European version...must be the link, and subsequently it was Serra who had originally scored Luc's picture and it was the studio that pushed to have Eric's work replaced, as they believed the American audiences simply did not GET Eric Serra's original score. Still, this does not add up to a meager replacement. Bill Conti's score is still a wonderful collection of work to many Big Blue fans who were fortunate to have seen it; replacement or not!!As far as the longer original version everybody is talking about?...Who's to say what is the original version?...Directors are notorious for tinkering with their projects.

You either love it or hate it, very little middle ground. Personally I love it. When I first saw it in high school I had a group of friends who I was very close with and we knew each other as Big Chill friends. Today I could not tell you where one of them is. What I like about the movie most is the characters. There is something about every character, even Alex, I can relate to, and there is something about every character that reminds me of at least one person I knew in college. The dialog is very real, what would actually be said in that situation. I did not think the movie seemed very scripted. There are some LOL moments, some misty eye moments, some poignant moments, etc... I think anyone who is 30+ has the same questions as the characters in this movie. As a bonus, it simply has the best soundtrack I have ever heard. The songs fit the mood of the movie in general, and the specific scenes perfectly. They are not just songs for the sake of songs. Anytime I hear one of the songs from this film I immediately think Big Chill. Even 22 years after I first saw it, there are some scenes which just resonate so clearly with me. I like the fact the flashback scenes were cut out, I think it is best Alex is left faceless and you still get to know a bit about him. It is also a very well made movie. It fits together like a puzzle. Clues in part A make sense when you get to part B. Overall a great film with a tremendous cast. It is a movie you have to listen and pay attention to in order to get something from it. If all you like is Die Hard type movies, you will not get it. But if you like movies such as Dead Poets Society, Stand By Me, Good Will Hunting, Diner, Breaking Away, etc... watch The Big Chill. By the way, this movie DID NOT rip off Return of Secaucus 7. If you watch the extras of TBC DVD you know the idea for it came in the late 1970's. 1983 is simply the release date of TBC, it was not written, pitched, filmed, and released in one year.

Because of this technical achievement, the viewer can't take his eyes of the screen.2) Barbara Stanwyck's beautiful performance.

She IS Phyllis Dietrichson.3) Billy Wilder's unforgettable script. A story that nowadays would seem simple turns in great dialogue, plot twists, and a narrative structure that keeps you on the edge of your seat right from the start. The characters do exactly what they're supposed to do and the script shows you exactly how and why.Other great aspects include the direction, the settings, the music, and the great performances by Robinson and MacMurray.
