I found no comparisons but for the main character and the animated look. This movie offers a story line spread so thinly that it tore within the first 30 minutes.  I didn't laugh once in the first hour before I decided to get up and write how boring this movie is.  The little girl is cute, but offers no surprises, and has very little attitude for supposedly a scary presence.  The monsters remind me of the blue-collar characters from the row houses of Baltimore.  The viewer is not allowed any kind of reference to any of the monsters past or their future. The entire movie is predictable, boring and difficult to watch. You will not likely run across anyone that says they have watched this movie multiple times as they did with Shrek.  I give it a 2 of 10, and advise anyone that expects to see anything mythical, creative, or enchanting to avoid this movie.There's not even one good line in Monsters Inc.  Remember from Shrek..Yes.

I will say that Christina Ricci looked beautiful and that the boy who played Pumpkin was a good actor.  Unfortunately, I feel I'm giving him extra credit because everything else in this movie was just so incredibly horrible.  To start with plot points that make this movie unbearable, there's the often-mentioned blowing up car scene in which Catherine's boyfriend escapes paralyzed but unscratched.  Not only is this incredibly unbelievable, but it had nothing to do with the movie other than to, supposedly, show him what it felt like to be in Pumpkin's shoes.  Um, help me if I'm the only one that noticed this, but Pumpkin was retarded and could walk, and the boyfriend (sorry, I just saw the movie and can't remember his name) ends up in perfectly fine mental health and paralyzed.  I really don't see the connection.  OK, also, who the heck is stupid enough to completely forget that they left someone on the beach?  That's insane.  I could go on and on, about the completely random scene where she swallowed all those drugs and survived, about why Kent (that's his name!) became a coach (?) for the Challenged Athlete's team, about what the deal was with the stupid bug in salad, but it's kind of painful to think about.  As for running problems with this movie  1.  The acting sucked.  Even Christina Ricci.  With the exception of Pumpkin (by the way, they never explained the meaning of his name at all), every single character in this movies acted excruciatingly absurd, especially Kent.  This guy was worse than any actor in any movie I've ever seen.  He makes me think of an elementary school play.  I'm \/not\/ joking.  2.  The cinematography sucked.  There were weird random close-ups that made the whole thing feel fake (as if other aspects didn't do that enough) and made me really uncomfortable.  3.  The casting sucked.  The people casted were just so completely far-fetched, including Pumpkin, that I couldn't handle it.  I mean, the woman who plays Suki on Gilmore Girls as a depressed psychomaniac?  I'll admit, she tried really hard, but she doesn't fit at all.  Neither does anyone else.  4.  Finally, the whole plot, the continuity, the theme, none of it was coherent.  Anyone who thought this movie was deep was seeing something that wasn't there, kind of like when you have a crush on a movie star because you feel like you know them or something.  There were so many scenes in this movie that could have been edited out because they just didn't have anything to do with anything.  There were entire characters that could have been edited out and it wouldn't have even mattered - like the professor.  And what was the deal with him falling to one knee after she left?  What was up with the weird hippie people?  Why would Kent \/ever\/ want Catherine back?  How did Pumpkin learn to walk and talk so well by the end of the movie when he couldn't even pronounce Catherine's name in the beginning?  How the heck did Pumpkin knock Kent down in the fight scene?  By running into him?  Please!  This movie is so ridiculous that I suggest you \/do\/ watch it, with a friend!

The story holds up well, jauntering along at a steady speed, with plenty of laughs a la Rickman along the way. The much argued over 'American Robin Hood' provides a decent performance - almost award winning if compared to the  one Mr Costner  recently produced. Of course, it pushes the bounds of reality more than ever so slightly to try and get the audience to believe this man with his disgustingly visible tan lines, as he steps out from a swim in the waterfall, really got so brown in the English countryside. His American drawl remains but possibly to the benefit of the film, as his strange attempt at what can only be described as Mockney, whilst shrouded in his poop covered sheet before the attempted rescue scenes, truly is the worst since Dick-Van-Dyke in Mary Poppins. In addition, it's difficult to see which English actor could really have been cast for the part way back in 1991. The need for a well-established star to lead the film would have been crucial and the lack of known English talent at the time was pitiful. Morgan Freeman does well in a role that doesn't really test him very much. The viewer gets the feeling that this is just a film he's doing to bide the time with until something juicy and actually worthy of his abilities comes along. The star of the show, undoubtedly, is Alan Rickman. Pantomime baddies rarely come any better, and his enthusiasm as the Sheriff of Nottingham exudes from every sharp one-liner sprinkled throughout the film. That, and his wonderfully over zealous running around the shop as things gradually deteriorate are reason alone to watch the film. The love interest is played adequately by Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, whilst Christian Slater isn't needed at all. Anyone else - possibly even an 'unknown' English actor - could have carried his part with their hands tied behind their back. However, Hollywood execs rule so another 'established' American star gets in and makes things that bit more unbelievable. Nevertheless, the rarely mentioned supporting cast does a fantastic job of convincing the audience that these people really are part of the legend of Sherwood Forest. It really is a 'Who's-Who' of cheap British television actors thrown together, mixed over a steady heat, with quite a good result at the end of it. Trying to remember the shows they were in proves a game in itself, when the endless character-building claptrap our Robin keeps coming out with gets a bit much. Kevin Reynolds redeems himself with this effort, a few years before the 'less-said-about-the-better' Waterworld. His direction makes the most of the forest backdrop, and the English countryside, whilst the castle scenes are suitably dimly lit without making the whole thing seem too serious. If you've never seen it, get it out or catch it on telly next time. Don't stress too much over the inconsistencies and shortcomings - that'll just spoil what is, in essence, a nice little Sunday evening flick. Rollicking fight scenes, a nice splattering of comedy and a few Hollywood heavyweights thrown in for the hell of it. Robin Hood's certainly come a long way. And all without a single pair of green, leg-hugging tights in sight.

And in Strange days you get a a chance to do just that, seeing fragments of other peoples lives and feelings. Think how it would revolutionize the porn industry, you actually fell the girl you're watching, a paraplegic would be able to feel his legs, you could be doing crazy stunts, but wouldn't get hurt. But you could also see people dying, and here's where plot thickens. But I won't go into that, because it's too complicated. Ralph Fiennes is pretty good as Nero, the sleazy fragment dealer with  greasy hair, but Juliette Lewis was totally miss cast.

I went into this movie with an open mind (ha!) but came out with my appetite less than satisfied. (ha ha ha ha... ha.)Hannibal Lecter, the criminal genius deliciously played by Anthony Hopkins is now living abroad in Italy, and Clarice Starling, in 9 years has, thanks to Jodie Foster's refusal to be in this film, transformed into a completely different person. Not just the actress is different, either. Clarice now holds the record for the most kills by an FBI agent, according to the Guiness Book of World Records. (I'm not making this up.) The Clarice character has drastically changed since we last saw her, but unfortunately it's not in ways we can believe. She seems hardened and more solemn than before, but Julianne Moore, bravely stepping into Foster's shoes, finds herself in over her head.Thankfully, Hannibal hasn't changed much. To the film's benefit, it is sometimes thrilling to see the charismatic killer free on his own. Thrilling, but not scary. In fact, now that I think about it, this movie is not scary once. Which is surprising, considering it has five times more blood and gore than the original. So why isn't it scary? In Silence, the Lecter character was truly terrifying because of his limitations. The light of evil motivation shining in his eyes was infinitely more frightening than actually seeing him disembowel an unfortunate man in this movie. It's the hint, the suggestion of what he can do that is scary. To see him actually carrying it out is tiring and boring. After all, how many times have we seen a serial killer murdering people? After years of seeing the same formula repeated, it's tedious. In this respect, in Hannibal the Lecter character is reduced to Michael Meyers or Jason qualities, which is nothing short of an insult to Silence Of The Lambs.I haven't even gotten into the plot, which involves a surviving victim of Lecter's killing spree tracking him down to gain his revenge. In comic book form, this might just have worked, but seeing it on screen is almost laughably contrived. It also presents an ethical dilemma that the story prefers to leave completely unresolved. What we have here is one serial killer attempting to kill another. Who are we to root for? Clarice doesn't even seem to have a real part in this one, other than to stand by and witness what's going on. Basically we have our choice between cheering for an insane cannibalistic serial killer and an under-written, faceless (ha ha!) homocidal masochist. A movie so bad that Jodie Foster refused to be in it and Anthony Hopkins publicly voiced that he did it only for the money, Hannibal is basically an art-house sequel to Friday The 13th. The direction and some of the writing is very good, but essentially, this movie resembles a chicken with it's head cut off. It runs around in circles, going nowhere and periodically splurts blood all over everything, before it finally hits a wall and dies.(1\/2\/****) ","genre":null},{"date":"27 November 2002","score":"","review":"  It would be difficult for any movie to follow up Silence Of The Lambs, but it would have been nice to get a sequel with a little bit of originality or insight.

Why does this girl want to help people, divide them into months, what's her story? And why do I say it's risky? Coz these romantic movies can drown my heart and crush it with a sad ending. I've always evaded such movies but I decided to take the risk for this one.Reeves and Theron were marvellous and incredible, and the story moves quite well for most of the part. It really tells the complete change of Nelson because of Sara and how he became such a good person is really nice and rewarding. And the movie slowly reveals on the mystery of Sara and why she's doing all these things.I feel the movie is really romantic and enchanting, I was completely intoxicated for days and it is as if it left me what Sara was trying to give Nelson. It was very beautiful.But the movie had some shortcomings, first I think it didn't explain and build up on Sara's character enough, Sara's the main mystery of this story, Sara's the main character. There were some events which were odd and we don't even know what was happening and why. Second, the ending was really not my type. It made me really sad in the end, and I think it's partly because this movie is meant for the adults. I wanted hope, and the ending I prefer is one which makes you feel good, one which leaves no loose ends. If the ending had been nice, I would give this movie a 10\/10 Excellent. It was that close...Nevertheless, this movie was made this way I guess, to make Sara a mystery, her masterplan and her rules, her strive for immortality. Hence the ending... but for me I think it doesn't fit for the big part, I disagree because I have clashing beliefs. But then I loved the movie for the romanticism and for the incredible beauty in it's characters.And for that, I count this as something really worth it and do love it very much despite the 'terrible' ending.

Because the plot is unlike any story I've seen these days, it's unique, it's interesting and it's risky. The plot is very unique and mysterious. Why does this girl want to help people, divide them into months, what's her story? And why do I say it's risky? Coz these romantic movies can drown my heart and crush it with a sad ending. I've always evaded such movies but I decided to take the risk for this one.Reeves and Theron were marvellous and incredible, and the story moves quite well for most of the part. It really tells the complete change of Nelson because of Sara and how he became such a good person is really nice and rewarding. And the movie slowly reveals on the mystery of Sara and why she's doing all these things.I feel the movie is really romantic and enchanting, I was completely intoxicated for days and it is as if it left me what Sara was trying to give Nelson. It was very beautiful.But the movie had some shortcomings, first I think it didn't explain and build up on Sara's character enough, Sara's the main mystery of this story, Sara's the main character. There were some events which were odd and we don't even know what was happening and why. Second, the ending was really not my type. It made me really sad in the end, and I think it's partly because this movie is meant for the adults. I wanted hope, and the ending I prefer is one which makes you feel good, one which leaves no loose ends. If the ending had been nice, I would give this movie a 10\/10 Excellent.

I read in Empire magazine the film was in the works, and who was the lead back then? None other than Sarah Michelle Gellar. Although it wasn't confirmed, I was thrilled to read the basic plot, as my brother got me playing the video games not long before I read the article.The film itself has connections to the game, but you don't need to play them all to understand it. The cast, which actually is made up of a few Brits, become likeable. Those who make it through the first 30 mins anyway. The few who meet their end in the laser hallway don't really have much dialogue, so it's not loss seeing them die. Milla (a good-looking actress, yet to prove she's anything more to me) is clearly totty for the lads. Lets face it, who on Earth wears a slinky dress like that when planning to stay in for the night!? Does she feel the cold?I didn't quite follow the absence of Jill Valentine, and instead the choice of naming the lead Alice... I may have missed something in the games there. I'll admit, I'm no whizz at playing them and staying alive.Back to the film. I found the zombie scenes pretty tense. Although it doesn't take much to get me biting my nails, you do want a few of the cast to live through the film, so the action scenes were both entertaining and scary. the scenes with the zombie dogs were great. Michelle Rodriguez and Martin Crewes aren't on their best form here, but I still liked their characters. Both their deaths come as a surprise. Arguably, Rodriguez's zombie-turn sucks. I wanted her to get through it all, but her death was cool. I wasn't overly keen on Eric Mabius. He's pretty wooden throughout the movie, and I wasn't too bothered if he was killed, or not. Although I am looking forward to the outcome of his bizzare arm incident in the sequel.The licker showdown at the end provides a few tense moments. It's not right to say the thing didn't look real, or convincing, because this is a film about zombies... I have no idea what the licker was all about, or if it is a reference to the games, but it keeps the action going when the crew are rid of zombies. Just as everyone is out fine, the thing appears and sees off one of the crew, while another turns into a zombie. The ending was slightly perky for a moment, so the re-appearance of the monster and two deaths is my kind of ending.The actual ending, with the Manson theme is excellent. From what I know, the ending was something similar to the opening in one of the Resident Evil video games. (I could really do with a trivia site to explain the links, or gaps between the film and the game. I get the feeling I haven't played all the Resident Evil games....)Generally I'm not too sure I'd tell anyone to see this. Some people aren't too keen on, or convinced by the whole zombie theme, or find action scenes annoying and loud, but I enjoyed the entire film. As for the kids who play the games.. (be honest, people younger than 15, or R-rated, I think it is in the States, play the video games) they'd probably love all the action. Like Tomb Raider, they might get bored with all the banter and explanations, but they'd get a kick from it... 9\/10 from me.

Just as everyone is out fine, the thing appears and sees off one of the crew, while another turns into a zombie. The ending was slightly perky for a moment, so the re-appearance of the monster and two deaths is my kind of ending.The actual ending, with the Manson theme is excellent. From what I know, the ending was something similar to the opening in one of the Resident Evil video games. (I could really do with a trivia site to explain the links, or gaps between the film and the game. I get the feeling I haven't played all the Resident Evil games....)Generally I'm not too sure I'd tell anyone to see this. Some people aren't too keen on, or convinced by the whole zombie theme, or find action scenes annoying and loud, but I enjoyed the entire film. As for the kids who play the games.. (be honest, people younger than 15, or R-rated, I think it is in the States, play the video games) they'd probably love all the action. Like Tomb Raider, they might get bored with all the banter and explanations, but they'd get a kick from it... 9\/10 from me.

I read in Empire magazine the film was in the works, and who was the lead back then? None other than Sarah Michelle Gellar. Although it wasn't confirmed, I was thrilled to read the basic plot, as my brother got me playing the video games not long before I read the article.The film itself has connections to the game, but you don't need to play them all to understand it. The cast, which actually is made up of a few Brits, become likeable. Those who make it through the first 30 mins anyway. The few who meet their end in the laser hallway don't really have much dialogue, so it's not loss seeing them die. Milla (a good-looking actress, yet to prove she's anything more to me) is clearly totty for the lads. Lets face it, who on Earth wears a slinky dress like that when planning to stay in for the night!? Does she feel the cold?I didn't quite follow the absence of Jill Valentine, and instead the choice of naming the lead Alice... I may have missed something in the games there. I'll admit, I'm no whizz at playing them and staying alive.Back to the film. I found the zombie scenes pretty tense. Although it doesn't take much to get me biting my nails, you do want a few of the cast to live through the film, so the action scenes were both entertaining and scary. the scenes with the zombie dogs were great. Michelle Rodriguez and Martin Crewes aren't on their best form here, but I still liked their characters. Both their deaths come as a surprise. Arguably, Rodriguez's zombie-turn sucks. I wanted her to get through it all, but her death was cool. I wasn't overly keen on Eric Mabius. He's pretty wooden throughout the movie, and I wasn't too bothered if he was killed, or not. Although I am looking forward to the outcome of his bizzare arm incident in the sequel.The licker showdown at the end provides a few tense moments.

All the Batman movies became a showcase for big name stars to strut their stuff as the villain and we never really get any character development of Bruce Wayne\/Batman or to delve into his psyche, motivation and past.

It chilled me to the bone.  The story is about a precocious young boy named Todd who, through a little detective work, discovers that an elderly German gentleman in his neighborhood is actually an escaped Nazi, Kurt Dussander, who performed unspeakable acts during the Holocaust.  The naive Todd, full of curiosity, threatens to turn Dussander in unless he tells him in detail all about the horrors of his crimes.  Todd is too young to comprehend the evil he is unleashing upon himself, and in the next five years, becomes obsessed and consumed by it.  His adolescent fantasies and dreams become ones of violence rather than sex, until his desire to kill completely replaces all other desires.  He plays society's game, pretending to be interested in school and girls, but in the end, the evil can no longer be hidden and he falls prey to it.  The movie's most fatal flaw is that it doesn't cover nearly the span of time it should.  Todd's *development* isn't a part of the movie at all.  What made the book so disturbing is how young and naive Todd was at the beginning, and how he grew up with Dussander's evil.  I realize this is difficult to do in a movie, but it is possible.  In the movie, Todd is pretty much the same age throughout.  The movie also doesn't get into Todd's head.  Todd's lack of interest in sex is mentioned as a footnote in the scene in the car with Becky Trask (Betty Trask in the book), but it is never developed or explained.  The audience is left saying ...huh??  Stephen King emphasized this aspect of the story in his book for a reason- sex is number one in most adolescents' minds, but Todd cares only about evil.  Even sex isn't important to him. The ending was quite different in the movie as well, but I'm not going to call that a flaw because I thought that Stephen King's ending was rather abrupt.  I can't really decide which ending I prefer.  Neither really completed the story in my opinion.  Psychological thrillers are difficult to portray on screen, I know.  But, unfortunately, this disturbing story was turned into just your average horror flick.  One highlight, though, was the casting of David Schwimmer as the dorky, sneaker-wearing guidance counselor Ed French.  He's exactly how I pictured French when I read the book.  Well, from what I gather from others who have commented, if you haven't read the book, you might like this movie.  If you have read the book, you'll be disappointed.  Either way, I highly recommend the book.
