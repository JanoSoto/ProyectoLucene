Barrabas witnesses the Crucifixion. He can do this because he has been spared his life due to the fact that once a year, a prisoner can be pardoned. Of course, the people call for him and reject Christ. All this follows the plot and Barabbas find himself back in his old ways. He is a subversive, but really all about himself. The book was written in 1951 by a man who had rejected Christianity. The problem with the movie is that it sucks so much humanity out of its main character. The subtle moments that show he is on a course of self discovery, don't, for me, match the book's character. I also found the whole gladiator thing, which never appears in the book, to be strictly fodder for the lowest common denominator. It is probably because this was competing with the other Biblical epics of that time. I will give Jack Palance credit. He is about as mean spirited as anyone ever in film, a true psychotic presence with his almost maniacal grin. I think at that point the subtleties went out the window. It's not a terrible movie (it's quite decent in its own way), but I think with a director and some writers that could have embraced the novel a bit more (and kept the original characters as they are described) and not bowed to popular culture, it would have been much better.

Luhrmann is know for his cutting-edge approach to filmmaking, and R + J is no exception. He's updated the setting of Shakespeare's play from Renaissance Verona to contemporary Verona, Florida. However, he's kept Shakespeare's language. Other directors have used the same technique, but I haven't seen a Shakespeare play in a modern setting that is this loud, this noisy, and this filled with primary colors. It's a determinedly modern film, despite the language.To make this concept work, Luhrmann needed the right actors. Leonardo DiCaprio did well enough as Romeo. He was 21 when the film was made, and still had a slender, youthful charm. I think he should keep his day job, though. I'm not eager to watch him play Shakespeare on the stage.By contrast, Claire Danes is the perfect Juliet. From the minute we set eyes on her, we say, This is Juliet. Danes portrays both the strength and vulnerability that define Juliet. (We tend to think of Juliet as a victim, and she is. However, she's not just a victim. She's a tough, tenacious young woman who struggles fiercely against tremendous odds, and almost wins.)Danes was only 16 when R + J was shot, but she was already a seasoned actor. However, it was Luhrmann's film that made her a star. After that, there was no stopping her. I believe she would be extremely successful acting Shakespeare on the stage. Think of her as Lady MacBeth. Danes could goad a husband into killing his king, and she would make everyone in the theater believe that she could do it.The other actors in the film ranged from competent to excellent. I would single out the outstanding work of Harold Perrineaus as Mercutio. When he says, A plague on both your houses, he makes you understand that he means it.R + J has a modest 6.9 IMDb rating. My guess is that it was too old-fashioned for people who wanted a traditional action film, and too wide a stretch for people who wanted classic Shakespeare. I think the movie deserves more than 6.9, and I recommend it. This is a film that will work much better on a large screen than a small screen. Police helicopters, and views from helicopters, will lose some of their power if not seen on a large screen. On the other hand, the film is noisy and drenched with color. If that's not to your taste, the movie might work better on a small screen, where you are somewhat removed from the immediacy of the action.If you don't like Shakespeare, or if you don't like modern-version Shakespeare, here's my suggestion. See the film, and fast forward through the scenes that don't include Juliet. When Claire Danes is on the screen, watch carefully.

The plot twists and Crawford's anti-demure playing of her character make this worth a watch.

","genre":"Drama, Horror, Thriller"},{"date":"19 June 2014","score":"","review":" Lucy Harbin took an axe, gave her husband forty whacks, when she saw what she had done, she gave his girlfriend forty one. So is the life of Lucy Harbin, played by dynamite Joan Crawford. After spending twenty years in an insane asylum for her crime, she is released and goes to live with her daughter on their farm property, but it is not long before goings on around the farm seem to point to Lucy's questionable sanity (and innocence).While William Castle earned his reputation for schlock-ridden gimmicky horror films, his pictures with Crawford are true gems; this film and I Saw What You Did, to be specific. While Crawford's meditated approaches to performance are part of what made these films so effective, it is inarguable that these films were well written and well directed. Penned by Robert Bloch, the author of Psycho, Strait-Jacket plays on Harbin's potential madness like piano keys&#x97; it's routine, sure, but for 1964, it's still a fresh approach to insanity on film. What's most surprising though is, as in Psycho, the way in which the film's conclusion turns on its audience, and the plot twist is just as unexpected to a 21st century audience as it was in 1964.Crawford's dedication to her role in the film is astounding, and in Strait-Jacket she is able to take a stab at the madwoman villainess whom she played opposite to in Whatever Happened to Baby Jane? two years earlier. Crawford's determination and gall really pay off for her, because the role, no matter how dramatic or emotive it is, is convincing. Diane Baker plays opposite as Crawford's tormented daughter and is able to hold her ground against the grand dame of madness. Overall, Strait-Jacket is a solid thriller with Castle's schlocky touch, but its writing is sophisticated and its performances impressive enough to elevate it far beyond any sort of gimmick.

I rented Phantasm and while it was interesting with its nostalgic 70's feel and iconic Tall Man, it was also boring. It didn't have a lot of special effects (cheap or otherwise), and with all the emphasis on the relationship between the two brothers, it almost seemed like a dark soap opera. Now, watching this movie again for the first time in years, there's a LOT going on here that I never noticed before. It's a sincere, weird, and effective film that gets its power from the poignant story of a boy who needs someone to raise him, emotional trauma and sleep-deprivation-induced hallucinations, vaguely occult initiation rituals, and clever scriptwriting that never makes it fully clear whether the weird stuff going on is real or not. I think this movie, at its core, is about a teenage boy unable to come to terms with the trauma of losing both his parents and his big brother. He can't get his head around it -- it's just too horrible. So he distances himself from it with imaginative delusions about some awful Death Figure (the Tall Man), and an exciting fantasy where his older brother and him Fight The Bizarre and Terrifying Forces of Death, all of which is just a projection of the real-life deaths which Mike cannot accept.And the movie ends with the Tall Man STILL after the boy, which just shows that Mike is going to be dealing with the terrible trauma of losing his immediate family for a long time; the Tall Man is just the reality of those deaths asserting itself to him. It's very sad, but in a good way because that's just how things work out sometimes, without sugarcoating. I had some friends who lost close family members and there's no happy ending for them either, they've felt the pain ever since. In the words of Mikey, there's somethin' else. At the risk of sounding like a nut, the movie strongly hints that the Tall Man also represents some parasitic, discarnate entity that was drawn to Mike because of his vulnerable state. Say what you want about ghosts and whatever, but I do think that there are harmful sentient impulses out there that look to feed off and exploit the weak, the wounded, and drug addicts\/alcoholics.So that's why I think this movie is a classic. It's an unfiltered nightmare inspired by a great loss. This bottom layer was ripped away from all the sequels in favor of the imaginative mythology that grows out of it (the Tall Man, the killer spheres, living-dead slaves, etc.), and that works too, but that's why they also don't have much of the eerie power of the first.Also, the music is PERFECT. Right at the beginning there's that long, alien wail, wavering in and out of pitch, like the cry of a madman deep inside an asylum.

Along with Pulp Fiction and The Shawshank Redemption we got Forrest Gump, an idiosyncratic movie that became a global phenomenon. Popular with both critics and audiences, it accomplished the rare feat of winning the Best Picture Oscar while also ranking #1 at the box office for the year.The story revolves around the title character, a dim-witted Alabamian who unwittingly plays a part in some of the key events of the 20th century. From inspiring Elvis Presley's signature gyrations to meeting the president (twice), Gump pops up all over the place as either a participant or an observer. This tour through American history will hold special appeal for baby boomers but those from subsequent generations with a reasonable grounding in American history will also get a kick out of it. However, the movie isn't just a nostalgia trip. The central love story supplies a strong thread linking everything together, as does Gump's relationship with his mother and his two best friends.That being said, perhaps the main reason why the story comes off as well as it does is the actors. Tom Hanks, in the title role, is the movie's anchor. His performance is by turns funny and touching and it led to a well-deserved second consecutive Best Actor Oscar. The rest of the principle actors were scarcely less impressive. Sally Field as Forrest's mother, Robin Wright as his long-time love interest and Gary Sinise as Lieutenant Dan all gave awards-worthy performances. Also worthy of note is Mykelti Williamson, whose relatively small role as Bubba was nevertheless highly memorable.In terms of film-making craft, the movie shows exceptional polish. The direction by Robert Zemeckis is always well handled and the production values are excellent. The story's breadth provided ample opportunity for striking visuals and varied settings. ILM's Oscar-winning visual effects (which memorably inserted Hanks into archival footage, among other accomplishments) also deserves credit, though some of the effects are admittedly a little rough in comparison with future efforts. Throughout, Alan Silvestri's Oscar-nominated score provided a solid backdrop in tandem with countless shrewdly chosen period-specific pop songs.Ultimately, though, Forrest Gump is not without its detractors. Some claim that the movie is overly sentimental and that the title character is less than endearing. I don't agree with that at all. The movie's poignancy is well-earned and Gump himself is an iconic character vividly brought to life.

A friend and I saw it, and left the theater stunned. It was the first time I have ever had trouble sleeping after watching a movie, so impactful was the content.Silence is flawless in all aspects. Casting, screenplay\/plot, direction, cinematography, and editing are superb. By now, we are all familiar with Dr Lector (Anthony Hopkins), the deranged, brilliant psychologist who does battle with the forces of good, here represented by the FBI's Clarice Starling (Jody Foster. Perhaps her last great role). Hopkin's performance is a tour de force of acting. He uses words like knives to stab at Clarice, exposing her checkered past, extracting information that he stores to dig into her later on. And Clarice, a young FBI agent with strong experience in psychology, is clearly overmatched by Dr Lector. They play a back and forth cat and mouse game that will keep you on the edge of your seat throughout.Excellent casting includes the sanitarium head, Dr Chilton (Anthony Heald) who plays this sleazy Head who covets having Dr Lector as his prize while clumsily trying to snag a date with Clarice. Scott Glenn portrays Dr Crawford, Clarice's boss whom she looks up to. He has his own demons he's dealing with that are never fully revealed, and the father-mentor interaction between him and Clarice is palpable. Finally, there's the other evil force, excellently played by Ted Levine.There is a significant amount of killing, and some very viscerally evil scenes that are not for the squeamish. You will be moved, so if you are not good with strong physical scenes, you may want to close your eyes a lot. But you must see this film. The final piece is the editing and directing, which weaves every scene together so it all adds up and makes sense at the end, kind of like in Forest Gump, but with evil intent, not kindness.This film was one of those rare gems that even the Oscars got right by awarding it the triple crown of Oscars - Best picture, Best Director, Best Actor, and Best Actress.

But the idea of the controlled society, seeing the world for what it is and either giving in or going against the status quo is very intriguing. And if anything still relevant even today (still will be for a long time).After seeing references, countless of references to this film in media I had to see it. And I was expecting a b-movie. And in some instances during the movie it is cheesy, and a lot of the things happening doesn't make sense, yet I sat fascinated throughout the whole film.

Probably my least favorite movie i've ever watched. The acting wasn't bad and the film did tie in some aspects of popular culture and previous films, but if the viewer doesn't give a crap about any of the characters whatsoever, or the plot(if you could call it that), then whats the point. I gained nothing from watching this movie besides an intense feeling of emptiness that usually comes after wasting 150 or so minutes of your life watching a pathetic piece of crap film about nothing. Was I at the edge of my seat, yes, however It wasn't because of the suspense, I couldn't keep my head from falling forward or my eyes open. And the way that the scenes were arranged, terrible. The movie memento is hard to follow sometimes and slightly dull at some points but at least there was a freaking point in the way the scenes were arranged, considering the main character had memory problems. In this movie, there was no reason for the random mix up of the scenes, except to just do something different and make a movie so weird and disgusting the critics think its a masterpiece. I usually like movies that are critically acclaimed, like The Godfather, one of my favorite movies, but Pulp Fiction isn't even in the ball park.

Going to see it on the first day with my folks, which was a hot one, here was a film, Douglas fitted perfectly. As seeing him in many other tough roles, here he puts down is dukes, in what is one of his best performances. Disclosure is basically a revenge tale, where we have advanced in the computer age, and as you know, revenge is sweet. Having partially read the novel, as they're was much talk of demographics, computer chips, where I'd much more prefer the movie, the lengthy film has old jilted flame, Demi Moore taking Douglas step up role in this computer business, where she's now his boss. I must say, I liked Moore's performance, here. She plays the bitch so well. She sets up a private liason with Douglas in her office at the computer plant, to talk over some business, and it isn't soon before he's seduced by her, letting her do her thing, because of the weaker position he holds, and he is too, a week character which again, he wonderfully play. He bails, Moore threatening to destroy him, and this was her plan all along. What begins is a long draining court process with wifee (Goodall), where Moore claims rape, and with a merger coming up, this is the worst possible timing. The film was very interesting in the way the legal process was handled from both sides. Quite in-depth, Moore disputing a lot, saying Douglas came onto her, where his hope dwindles more and more. He hires a woman solicitor, (Roma Mafia) the scene stealer here, who has a speciality in these cases and she is good. I loved near the end when Douglas put on that computer equipment, I found myself dizzy watching it. Sutherland is great and slightly menacing as the company's big boss. But really, the film is really blown out of light plot, and a lot of times it strangely feels like it veers away from it's story of harassment, where our big boys at the computer office, are more interested with the merger going through, instead of Douglas's troubles. The film, which is a little slick is still worth a watch, if for Douglas fans, and as for Moore's character in the end, that is something that's very much disclosed.

I also remember reading that when Kubrick and Producer John Harris finally had their hands on the novel Lolita, one would tear the page out for the other they were so eager to read it. Controversial for the time would be an understatement, but how well does it hold up today? Well I can't help but say some of the controversial subject matter feels a little dated. No I don't mean the paedophile aspect, I mean the idea of a girl her age wearing that kind of clothing being considered scandalous after seeing what some girls actually wear 50 years on. I'd imagine half these shots coming straight out of Vogue or something, possibly echoing Kubrick's career at Look magazine.Well the only problem I had with this movie is the length and pacing. It is without doubt a slow one, yet I think it helps James Mason's character appear more human, albeit extremely flawed. Hopelessly he indulges her, and in return she knows how to get exactly what she wants. Sue Lyon, Peter Sellers and Shelly Winters shine in the time they have, and in the end everyone gets their individual comeuppance. That is the plot in a nutshell, again whether the source material was more risqué I've yet to discover.In the age of the Internet and all you hear about is how extreme some sexual predators can be, and as a man born in 1992 I find it harder to see how this movie could be considered so controversial outside of the era it was made in. What is clear however is that Kubrick shoots wonderfully, and having the church literally condemn your movie of course it wouldn't be able to go very far (Stanley himself said had he known how strict the rules were, he wouldn't have made it). I admire the gusto in which Kubrick had attempted any sexualised work, whereas world cinema at the time such as Federico Fellini's La Dolce Vita (1960) had never had such problems (Although the Church condemned that film for entirely different reasons). Considering that the original author Vladimir Nabokov, along with Kubrick wrote the screenplay, it definitely shows both men were putting in their best effort.Final Verdict Controversial yet dated.
