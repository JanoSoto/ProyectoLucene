This to me ranks up there with other movies like True Romance for the quirky script and the we've known each other forever interaction between the three Saints. The script is well written with black comedy undertones that give you a chuckle. The cast band it about like its really happening and no acting is going on at all. In fact you get completely lost in it.What starts out as a chance happening turns into a solid action movie that at times had me wondering is this real. I like the one thing leads to another feel from this movie. Don't get me wrong most of the time you don't see whats coming but on occasion you do but it doesn't spoil the enjoyment, you get the oh no, they aren't gonna do that factor and are exhilarated when they do. Willem Dafoe is great in his part - something really different for him. For us girls Conor and Murphy are just to die for - their sense of right and wrong lends to a show of a male feminine side, tied up with all that machismo, has me swooning. This film should get the vote for the ugliest woman on film. All I can say is bring on number 2! I cant believe I only just found this film. My regret is that I didn't know about it sooner.

I would class it as a B movie, but a good one. Kurt Russel is a young handsome anti hero, who doesn't care about anyone or anything. He has that youthful rebellion and mystery about him needed for his role. He is a criminal caught making a bank robbery and perhaps has a hardened soul, but Carpenter has still managed make him a likable rogue. Snake is forced to be a hero. The only thing that makes him take the job offered to him is because he is forced to save his own life in the process. The dark landscape and the nightmarish atmosphere adds to the suspense. I was quite young when this movie first came out and it did get my blood pumping then. Many years later (and many scary movies later) the affect has somewhat lessened, but the movie structurally is still as good as it ever was. It has stood the time where many movies haven't. I bought the DVD just last week and was disappointed. The original 99 minutes was reduced to 94 minutes, which means that a lot of the gritty stuff was removed by the Swedish\\Finnsih film board. The uncut version was fast paced and somewhat gory.I really detest it, when someone chops up a good movie, specially when all the juicy bits get taken out.

In particular, we are subjected to an immense amount of rumination upon the spiritual, belief and faith but at a level of very puerile Sunday-school philosophy. A matter made worse by the role in this of the flunked priest and presidential adviser who seems to have been intended as both the love element and a figure of integrity. He actually comes across as smarmy, disingenuous, hypocritical, selfish and ultimately bereft of a true moral compass. In spite of his pompous pontifications about his buddy relationship with God, he acts purely on a self-interest basis and to be frank, is a bit of a reptile.To an extent, the story seems to have been turned into an anti-science rant, which I cannot believe Sagan intended. The plot doesn't help. Having created a wonderful enigma ( what really happened cannot be answered ) which is expressive of so much in the scientific experience, it then destroy's this effect by revealing ( back-stage as it were ) a secret piece of evidence that confirms that there was in fact proof of only one version of what had happened! Maybe the producers didn't have faith in the audience's ability to handle the question.In any case, if the alternative explanation of a hoax needed to be tested, it would have been easy to find out one way or another if that was the case, now that Haddon was dead!Moreover, why did Foster's character not continue to study the same source, rather than building new dishes to help her start all over from scratch?There are also BIG problems over the setting of the events.

Even more rare is when I'm speechless about a film by a favorite filmmaker. And to further the irony, the film is titled Storytelling. Written and directed by Todd Solondz (Welcome to the Dollhouse, Happiness), Storytelling is actually two short stories within the same film.Being a fan of Solondz's work, I can't possibly pretend to be surprised that Storytelling is depressing. Anyone who has seen his other work knows what he or she is in for going in. One thing that I felt about Storytelling more than any of the other two Solondz films I've seen is that it seemed a lot more personal. The character of Toby is clearly a representation of Solondz, and a depiction and answer to and of his critics who say that he is a horrible person for mocking his characters, etc. In the film, when a fellow filmmaker criticizes Toby, telling him it is glib and facile to make fun of those people, Toby denies this, simply saying I love them. Looking back on his past work, and looking back on reviews I have written of those films, there is a definite pattern with the characterizations and the situations that Solondz writes them into. The situations are painful and the characters are sympathetic (or pathetic, depending on how you look at them), but the pain comes from Solondz not turning the camera away from the subject when they are at their most vulnerable. Most filmmakers, in order to make a more commercially acceptable film do not inject the kind of honesty that Solondz does, which naturally ends up creating criticism for him because it is different.Also notable is his defiant decision to, rather than cut his film according to MPAA standards to give it an R rating instead of NC-17, create a ridiculously large red box to mask the sex scene in Fiction. Apparently he was told that the scene either needed to be cut or he would get a higher rating, (an absolutely ridiculous notion because the action itself was not overly graphic, it was the details of the scene that were disturbing) so in his refusal to cut it, he decided to throw it back in the MPAA's face and call it what it was Censorship.Out of many disturbing scenes, there was one scene that I found so profound that it has not left my mind since I watched this film last night. Scooby decides that he wants to see the footage that Toby has shot thus far, so he travels into New York City to see him. Mike, who tells him that Toby is actually screening the footage elsewhere as they speak, greets him at the door. When Scooby gets to the screening, where various intelligista are gathered, he sees himself on the screen, giving his inner thoughts, while the audience is laughing. Other than to turn to the footage on the screen, the camera does not leave Scooby's face, which has been transformed from a look of hopefulness to a mask of grief. Later, when he returns home to an unexpected tragedy at home, among the various policemen, etc., Toby runs up to Scooby with Mike, camera in tow, saying, Oh my god, Scooby. I'm so, so sorry. To which Scooby, providing the last line of the film says, looking right into the camera, Don't be. Your movie's a hit. That scene, those words, and the rest of the film made Storytelling shockingly and almost unbearably good. Solondz, who has made a career out of turning his eye to the fraying suburban ideal, is at his bleakest with this film. I've read criticism that he is too dark, which make his films somewhat unwatchable; a notion I find absolutely ridiculous. True, his films are like repeatedly ripping scabs off of a wound, never allowing it to heal, but their profundity is almost tangible. Storytelling was so thought provoking and effective that I found myself too numb to fully react until I actually began to put my thoughts into words, at which point I felt like I wanted to cry my eyes out. In a society where films like Guess Who and Miss Congeniality rule the box office, I find this to be a really difficult film to universally recommend, but there are definitely those out there who will appreciate this film.

Most filmmakers, in order to make a more commercially acceptable film do not inject the kind of honesty that Solondz does, which naturally ends up creating criticism for him because it is different.Also notable is his defiant decision to, rather than cut his film according to MPAA standards to give it an R rating instead of NC-17, create a ridiculously large red box to mask the sex scene in Fiction. Apparently he was told that the scene either needed to be cut or he would get a higher rating, (an absolutely ridiculous notion because the action itself was not overly graphic, it was the details of the scene that were disturbing) so in his refusal to cut it, he decided to throw it back in the MPAA's face and call it what it was Censorship.Out of many disturbing scenes, there was one scene that I found so profound that it has not left my mind since I watched this film last night. Scooby decides that he wants to see the footage that Toby has shot thus far, so he travels into New York City to see him. Mike, who tells him that Toby is actually screening the footage elsewhere as they speak, greets him at the door. When Scooby gets to the screening, where various intelligista are gathered, he sees himself on the screen, giving his inner thoughts, while the audience is laughing. Other than to turn to the footage on the screen, the camera does not leave Scooby's face, which has been transformed from a look of hopefulness to a mask of grief. Later, when he returns home to an unexpected tragedy at home, among the various policemen, etc., Toby runs up to Scooby with Mike, camera in tow, saying, Oh my god, Scooby. I'm so, so sorry. To which Scooby, providing the last line of the film says, looking right into the camera, Don't be. Your movie's a hit. That scene, those words, and the rest of the film made Storytelling shockingly and almost unbearably good. Solondz, who has made a career out of turning his eye to the fraying suburban ideal, is at his bleakest with this film. I've read criticism that he is too dark, which make his films somewhat unwatchable; a notion I find absolutely ridiculous. True, his films are like repeatedly ripping scabs off of a wound, never allowing it to heal, but their profundity is almost tangible. Storytelling was so thought provoking and effective that I found myself too numb to fully react until I actually began to put my thoughts into words, at which point I felt like I wanted to cry my eyes out. In a society where films like Guess Who and Miss Congeniality rule the box office, I find this to be a really difficult film to universally recommend, but there are definitely those out there who will appreciate this film.

Even more rare is when I'm speechless about a film by a favorite filmmaker. And to further the irony, the film is titled Storytelling. Written and directed by Todd Solondz (Welcome to the Dollhouse, Happiness), Storytelling is actually two short stories within the same film.Being a fan of Solondz's work, I can't possibly pretend to be surprised that Storytelling is depressing. Anyone who has seen his other work knows what he or she is in for going in. One thing that I felt about Storytelling more than any of the other two Solondz films I've seen is that it seemed a lot more personal. The character of Toby is clearly a representation of Solondz, and a depiction and answer to and of his critics who say that he is a horrible person for mocking his characters, etc. In the film, when a fellow filmmaker criticizes Toby, telling him it is glib and facile to make fun of those people, Toby denies this, simply saying I love them. Looking back on his past work, and looking back on reviews I have written of those films, there is a definite pattern with the characterizations and the situations that Solondz writes them into.

We begin not long after part 3 with the surviving elm street kids now out of the institution and in high school. The character of Kristen, now played by Tuesday Night rather then Patricia Arquette, returns, but begins to think that Freddy is coming back. Kincad warns her not to bring him up or maybe he will come back. Well he does. This time in Kincaid's dream, he is in the junkyard where his bones were buried. His dog digs where the bones were laid to rest and pees out fire to let him out\/bring him back to life. Yes, to this day I can't watch that part without laughing. Freddy axes Kincaid, Joey ( Joey was dork anyway) and is about to take out Kristen. Freddy knows that she is the last and needs her help if he is to kill more. He tricks her into using her power to bring others into her dreams. Her friend Alice (Lisa Wilcox), is pulled in, Kristen dies but gives her power to Alice first. Alice does not understand her power nor how to control it. She ends up bringing her friends and brother to Freddy one by one. As Freddy slashes through more kids, Alice absorbs their powers and becomes the Dream Master. Eventually she confronts Freddy. In the final battle we are treated to a fight that is more than a little corny, but still delivers overall and sends Freddy to hell. But for good? Nightmare on elm Street 4 is probably the last good elm street film made. I still like this move a lot and it is very entertaining. The story overall is OK but for the most part nothing new. You know the story of every series, of the evil one coming back to life to wreak havoc among the stars of the movie. One has to ask, where did they get the idea to revive Freddy by having a dog take fire leak on his bones? WTF? Not to say I'm not amused by this, but who wrote that in? The concept of having Alice gain all the powers that the other kids possessed in their dreams was new though and I thought was one of the better aspects of the movie. Alice's character is also a great replacement for Kristen's and would return in part 5 to wreck Freddy again. Alice is probably the best thing to happen to the series after the death of Nancy. The acting is nothing special, I'm sure you didn't come to see this expecting great acting an neither did I. Freddy once again uses great one liners before taking out his foes. Though they are still good they get worse as the series goes on. The special effects are probably where the movie shines most. Most notably the soul food scene (disgusting), the souls escaping his body, and the movie theater scene. Freddy this time around disposes of them in all sorts of ways. The dream dojo scene with Rick is one of the better scenes in the movie. Anyone notice Rick is that guy Deke from Saved By The Bell that wanted to beat up Screech? Others include Freddy sucking face, roach motel and wet dream, all entertaining. The choreography could have been better, sometimes when the actors where jumping around, it looked out of place. The soundtrack isn't bad either. Typical 80's stuff here, you either love or hate the 80's. Sinaid O'connor's I Want Your Hands On Me, is a good song. But the opening song Nightmare by Tuesday Night is a really great song. Overall a good Freddy film that is fun watch, but certainly don't take it seriously. 7 half out 10 stars.

You would never see a really thoughtful film along the lines of Planet of the Apes, 2001, or even Logan's Run. We were given films about Bruce Willis blowing up an asteroid and movies about an alien fleet trying to blow up the world. Even Star Wars wasn't an intelligent movie. It was pure entertainment, but that was all it tried to be. Too many movies today are popcorn flicks with a moral tacked onto the end of the film. But every once in while, we find a diamond in the rough. Which is the case with Gattaca.Gattaca takes place in the near future. It presents a future that is completely plausible and seems to be strangely familiar. In this future, genetic manipulation has become quite mainstream, leading many parents to choose the perfect traits for their children. These children have perfect features and no trace of birth defects. They are all intelligent and almost perfect. However, they are not the mindless robots coming off of an assembly line that you may picture. The entire idea is completely realistic and plausible.However, some parents choose not to undergo this procedure, whether due to religious reasons or the inability to afford it. Regardless, these parents sometimes give birth to children with birth defects and other less-than-desired traits. These children are usually given the world's less-than-desirable jobs.Such is the case with Vincent, our main character. He was born with a heart condition and was expected to die by age thirty. His parents learned their lesson, and when they had a second child, they made sure that he had superior genes. This leads to an unusual sibling rivalry between Vincent and his brother. As a child, Vincent dreams of working with the space program called Gattaca. He has the brain-power to do it, but his genes are holding him back. DNA checks are mandatory for all new recruits. He continues into his adult life, getting a job as a janitor at Gattaca, which only increases his hunger for space. However, he soon finds a way out. Jerome Morrow is a former swimmer who becomes paralyzed from the waist down. After his accident, he simply fades off of the map. Through an identity-dealer, Vincent finds that he can alter his appearance and use Jerome's DNA to get a job at Gattaca. In return he will pay Jerome a portion of his salary. So the two begin a life together. Vincent becomes Jerome and gets a job a Gattaca.I don't want to ruin the entire story, but there are many interesting twists to keep your interest. The film also moves at an incredible pace, making the 101 minutes fly by. There are action scenes, but these are not Michael Bay action scenes by any means. Of course, that isn't a bad thing. What I am trying to say is that this is an intelligent film. While anyone can enjoy it for its rich story and good performances, those interested in science will be the most interested. The film offers many references to genetics including Jerome's middle name (Eugene is a reference to eugenics, the branch of genetics involving gene manipulation), Jerome's spiral staircase (a DNA strand), and even the films name (letters used to label the nucleotide bases of DNA).I must complement the film's cinematography. The films color palette is great, containing a lot of rich greens and blues. The look of the film is also great. It is very minimalist and just futuristic enough to keep things in line.Performances vary from good to great, but everyone does a pretty good job. Ethan Hawke does a great job playing Vincent, but Jude Law steals the show as Jerome. His wit and humor contrasting some heavy drama makes him an unforgettable character. Also noteworthy is Uma Thurman's performance as Vincents uniformist love interest.I must truly compliment Andrew Niccol. Had he simply written the script, he would deserve recognition.

If you do not wish to know how this occurred, read no further. Most people when the think of the famous mutiny on the bounty think of the way it was portrayed in the Clark Gable version. That in itself sealed the reputation of Captain Bligh as one of the most cruel people in history. It presented Fletcher Christian as a dashing hero who triumphed over a tyrant. Not the case here. The Bounty has questions to ask about the myth of the good of Christian and the evil of Bligh, and wishes to examine it without judging anyone involved. The films technical details are astounding, from the gorgeous cinematography to Vangelis' electronic score(reminiscent of Chariots of Fire in many ways), but it's the performances that make this so memorable. Anthony Hopkins is of course brilliant as Bligh, seen not as a sadistic tyrant who deserved to be usurped, but as a repressed and by the book captain who stubbornly kept to all the laws of the navy, because it's what he's wanted all his life, to be a good captain. There is a revealing scene in the movie where all the men are having the time of their lives with the islanders at a dinner, drinking and making love with a real sense of freedom that they've never experienced in England. All of them, that is, except Bligh. He's lying in his bed alone, looking up at the ceiling, sweating, realizing(correctly) that this freedom and peace and love will make the men want to stay and never want to leave, thus ruining the mission and breaking all the hearts of their families back home. This to me is the key to Bligh, it justifies in some way his somewhat cruel behavior toward the men later on, like Patton, he believe it's all for the good of the men. This of course puts him in direct conflict with everyone else, and the more the men struggle to remain on the island and become at ease, the more Bligh's behavior seems sadistic. Hopkin's gives a measured and complex performance that can be chilling(Oh they are RAMBLING are they???!!!). Mel Gibson, before he was a charismatic film icon who would become a world-renowned(or hated) filmmaker, was relatively unknown, having only done the Mad Max films. I believe that he gives the best performance of his acting career in this. I'm sure most people would expect him to play Christian as a charismatic do-gooder who fights for freedom and justice(i.e. Patriot or Braveheart), but this is not the case here. Here Christian is presented as an irresponsible dilettante who found a kind of peace and paradise in Australia that would appeal to him far more than his wife and family back home. He becomes too attached to this exotic world, and begins to appear unstable when faced with the decision to leave. The filmmakers don't have Christian say too much, and we never truly learn his real motives. He is't seen as a leader of the mutiny from the beginning, but seemed a likely person for the crew to be led by, since he was the highest officer appearing ill at ease with Bligh. Daniel Day-Lewis is also here in one of his early roles, as one of the officers. You can see briefly the subtle nuances he gives this character that foreshadow his success in films years later. You can see that while there is a certain area of Gray over who is right in this fight for power, the only true jerk aboard this ship is Day-Lewis' character, who is seen smiling and enjoying himself while the men are being punished. Liam Neeson has a good role as a lazy and insubordinate fool of a crewman who lives by his partying instincts, and it is a bit startling to watch this performance considering the way it's light years away from the wise and towering men of principle and quiet dignity he would go on to play(i.e. Schindler,Kinsey,Michael Collins,Rob Roy, etc.) Laurence Olivier and Edward Fox also appear as the men interrogating Bligh during the court martial, with Fox doing fine character work and Olivier being a chameleon yet again as the aged Admiral Hood. Bernard Hill(Thodon of Lord of The Rings, Captain in Titanic) also gives one of his solid Greek chorus and dignified performances as an observer. The movie does not answer if the mutiny was justified, nor does it do any finger pointing,but implies that the real problem was the divide between the repressed British and the free islanders that made the men mad. These characterizations and events all lead up to the mutiny itself, a truly stunning scene. I've seen it about a dozen times now, and it still sends chills down my spine, Gibson gives one hell of a performance in this scene, and just watch the co-conspirators and Bligh's faces when he explodes.

","genre":null},{"date":"31 March 2005","score":"3 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" The following review assumes you know about the famous mutiny on the bounty and who was involved. If you do not wish to know how this occurred, read no further. Most people when the think of the famous mutiny on the bounty think of the way it was portrayed in the Clark Gable version. That in itself sealed the reputation of Captain Bligh as one of the most cruel people in history. It presented Fletcher Christian as a dashing hero who triumphed over a tyrant. Not the case here. The Bounty has questions to ask about the myth of the good of Christian and the evil of Bligh, and wishes to examine it without judging anyone involved. The films technical details are astounding, from the gorgeous cinematography to Vangelis' electronic score(reminiscent of Chariots of Fire in many ways), but it's the performances that make this so memorable. Anthony Hopkins is of course brilliant as Bligh, seen not as a sadistic tyrant who deserved to be usurped, but as a repressed and by the book captain who stubbornly kept to all the laws of the navy, because it's what he's wanted all his life, to be a good captain. There is a revealing scene in the movie where all the men are having the time of their lives with the islanders at a dinner, drinking and making love with a real sense of freedom that they've never experienced in England. All of them, that is, except Bligh. He's lying in his bed alone, looking up at the ceiling, sweating, realizing(correctly) that this freedom and peace and love will make the men want to stay and never want to leave, thus ruining the mission and breaking all the hearts of their families back home. This to me is the key to Bligh, it justifies in some way his somewhat cruel behavior toward the men later on, like Patton, he believe it's all for the good of the men. This of course puts him in direct conflict with everyone else, and the more the men struggle to remain on the island and become at ease, the more Bligh's behavior seems sadistic. Hopkin's gives a measured and complex performance that can be chilling(Oh they are RAMBLING are they???!!!). Mel Gibson, before he was a charismatic film icon who would become a world-renowned(or hated) filmmaker, was relatively unknown, having only done the Mad Max films. I believe that he gives the best performance of his acting career in this. I'm sure most people would expect him to play Christian as a charismatic do-gooder who fights for freedom and justice(i.e. Patriot or Braveheart), but this is not the case here. Here Christian is presented as an irresponsible dilettante who found a kind of peace and paradise in Australia that would appeal to him far more than his wife and family back home. He becomes too attached to this exotic world, and begins to appear unstable when faced with the decision to leave. The filmmakers don't have Christian say too much, and we never truly learn his real motives. He is't seen as a leader of the mutiny from the beginning, but seemed a likely person for the crew to be led by, since he was the highest officer appearing ill at ease with Bligh. Daniel Day-Lewis is also here in one of his early roles, as one of the officers. You can see briefly the subtle nuances he gives this character that foreshadow his success in films years later. You can see that while there is a certain area of Gray over who is right in this fight for power, the only true jerk aboard this ship is Day-Lewis' character, who is seen smiling and enjoying himself while the men are being punished. Liam Neeson has a good role as a lazy and insubordinate fool of a crewman who lives by his partying instincts, and it is a bit startling to watch this performance considering the way it's light years away from the wise and towering men of principle and quiet dignity he would go on to play(i.e. Schindler,Kinsey,Michael Collins,Rob Roy, etc.) Laurence Olivier and Edward Fox also appear as the men interrogating Bligh during the court martial, with Fox doing fine character work and Olivier being a chameleon yet again as the aged Admiral Hood. Bernard Hill(Thodon of Lord of The Rings, Captain in Titanic) also gives one of his solid Greek chorus and dignified performances as an observer. The movie does not answer if the mutiny was justified, nor does it do any finger pointing,but implies that the real problem was the divide between the repressed British and the free islanders that made the men mad.

Steven Spielberg creates another masterpiece, a truly incredible visionary, he sets himself above all other filmmakers with this awe-inspiring film which truly has to be seen to be believed. Technically, this film is brilliant. Brilliantly shot, produced, scored and acted all vital components are of a tremendous standard. This film is so complicated and multi-layered, that I can't help but believe any other filmmaker would be unable to make the movie. The sheer amount of flashbacks and the visions of the pre-cogs and the conspiracy element, could potentially be confusing but Spielberg's gift of telling a story ensures this film is engaging and uses the layers as a benefit to show the sheer depth of his masterpiece.Spielberg has a wonderful quality in terms of using old fashioned cinematic techniques of making a good movie. All the components at a human level have to be right; then he brings out the most incredible groundbreaking special effects, and interweaves it with the human element to make it all seamless. A true gift. Tom Cruise is superb as John Anderton in this movie, a great anti-hero, a man driven by the loss of his son; he blames himself and turns to drugs to combat the problems he has. He believes fully in the pre-crime experiment as a law enforcement cop, but is forced to find the flaws of the system when the pre-cogs envisage Cruise is the next man to commit a murder. Cruise then must be on the run from the state as well as undercover the darkest secrets to the system we are told is perfect. This film is a film-noire with sci-fi, thriller qualities and a futuristic detective movie at the same time, its truly the most original and incredible film you are going to see in a long time. There are truly horrifying images which you would not necessarily expect from a Spielberg picture, the eye operation where Cruise gets his eyes removed is chilling. The image of the Spyders- these robotic spiders were ingenious as well as the futuristic mechanisms and transportation devices were awe-inspiring. And the scary thing is these devices are what the greatest minds in science currently believe the outlook of our world will be like in 50yrs time.The way the film is shot while being interwoven with a provoking JOhn Williams score, the picture quality was tinted with a grainy quality a dark blue tinge, to make what you were seeing something beyond reality, it created a dark dirty outlook of the movie. If you were being extra-critical however, i felt there were slight flaws to the movie. The ending i felt dragged at the end. The ending was still good and important to the movie, but i felt it was guilty of often over-explaining at the end. The scene where Cruise is faced by Lamarr the head of everything, (guilty of conspiring against Anderton)with a gun, Cruise then proceeds to sum up and then explain what the effect shooting Cruise would be. Putting Lamarr in a quandary basically saying his actions would prove or disprove his pre-crime vision etc.I got the impression we as the audience were slapped around the face with the information. It was as if the last 10minutes were made because they believed the audience would be lost and we needed to be put up to speed. I didn't feel it was necessary, and i thought somethings could have been left unsaid and give the audience a chance to think for themselves at the end. The film was never guilty of it during the movie-why suddenly the last part? I also felt the movie could be accused of slight contradiction. SPielberg through-out the movie made a dark menacing picture effectively portraying the flaws of a society where your privacy is none existent and you are a mere pawn of the state. No matter where you go your eyes will be your source of ID to keep the state's tabs on you. This is a commentary on what is a distinct possibility to what is going to happen to us in the future. Spielberg portrays this as a detriment to society effectively. Yet, the final scene where pre-crime is abandoned, Cruise is now back with his ex-wife and shes expecting a new child and the pre-cogs are sent to a peaceful area where they can live in peace and happiness. I got the impression it was all too easy to swallow, completely different to the outlook in the movie earlier. The last scene didn't encourage you to have a sense of fear about what the future could hold (which you are encouraged to believe through-out the film) yet the ending makes it all alright again.I believe the ending to be a flaw, however that is being extra-critical, on a movie basis it is a wonderful thought-provoking picture. AN astonishing peace of modern cinema. It is exciting, and brilliantly made. A groundbreaking piece of modern cinema, made by the greatest film maker of our generation.

True, this movie isn't for everyone, but if you're like me, it might possibly become one of your favorites of all time. I'm a big 80s junky, I love all the classics, from John Hughes to Cameron Crowe, and I always thought they just don't make teenage movies like the ones from yesteryear anymore. Then came Sebastian Cole. It looked and felt like a film picked straight out of the Golden Age, back in the 80s when teen movies were in their prime. The film was a timeless, edgy, and original take on something we've all seen before the coming of age story.

The statement is very clear war turns men into vicious animals, with no drives except to eat, copulate, and kill. Films in this category include 'King Rat', 'The Dirty Dozen', 'Platoon', and of course Stanley Kubrick's 'Full Metal Jacket'.With 'Jacket', Kubrick provides what is perhaps the most comprehensive and complete overview of how human beings are de-evolved through the military process. He begins in boot camp, where they are treated as scum, beaten and abused, and (in some cases) driven completely mad. By the time they reach the field, they are killing machines...angels of death, and the horror of battle only makes it worse.They suppress fear, pity, love...and and all emotions that distinguish humans from animals. Sex is purely physical gratification, and killing is a rush. There is no loyalty or patriotism; the desire to retrieve a wounded comrade is more akin to how a pack of wolves protects one of its own. They act on instinct rather than reason, and they do not hesitate to destroy everything they see.That is the plot of Full Metal Jacket. The movie itself is a scathing example of how horrible war truly is. Perhaps there is the potential for heroism...but few, if any, rise to it.

This is not really true, for there were and are aplenty worse. But one thing has always set Wood above the pack, and that was his own unshakable faith in his talent. Unfortunately, the faith was misplaced and the talent was nonexistent--and although this Tim Burton film takes a slew of liberties with the facts of Wood's life and career, it does a remarkable job of capturing them as Wood likely saw them through the filter of his own outrageous ego. The film has two tremendous assets the performers and its visual style. Johnny Depp leads the cast in the title role, and it is a virtuoso performance, for he entices us to like a man whose self-blindness would normally lead an audience to reject him out of hand; the performance is incredibly witty, wildly over the top, and yet it contains just enough pathos to allow us to relate to Wood on a human level. But the real stunner in the cast is Martin Landau, who picked up a Best Supporting Academy Award for his performance as Bela Lugosi, a legendary actor who was very much a forgotten star (not to mention morphine addict) by the time Wood befriended him in the early 1950s.As with Wood himself, the film plays fast and loose with the facts of Lugosi's life, but it nonetheless captures something very essential about both Lugosi and the Hollywood that destroyed him, something very elemental that transcends the weird comedy of the piece. And Landau gives the performance of his career; you truly believe that this is Lugosi before you, a strange but appealing mixture of faltering humanity and arrogance desperate for an audience now lost to him. Other memorable performances include Bill Murray as the inept and very la-dee-dah actor Bunny Breckinridge; Jeffrey Jones as The Amazing Criswell, popular psychic and occasional Wood actor; Lisa Marie as television's Vampira; and Sarah Jessica Parker as Wood's fast wife and occasional actress Dolores Fuller. Indeed, there isn't a false note in the entire cast right down to the bit players and extras.In terms of visual style, Tim Burton nails the very look of an Ed Wood film in glittering black and white--but working with a budget that Wood never dreamed of he merges it with a series of classic Hollywood idioms that lift the style out of Wood's unfortunately flat style and into the realm of high art. In both look and direction, I strongly feel that this is Burton's single finest film to date.If the film has a flaw, it is that at times it recreates the flatness of an Ed Wood film a bit too precisely over too long a period--and the result can feel slightly dragged. And it is also a film that will register most clearly with those who have actually seen the films on which the movie focuses, so it may not appeal to the uninitiated.

Not only is the whole atmosphere brooding and realistic, but the nature of Bickle (De Niro) is highly ambiguous - sometimes splitting opinion to weather he is hero or just plain psychopath.Tearing away from the stilted conventions of Hollywood films, Scorsese dares in this movie. The cinematography is great, with great shots showing Bickle's world, and the birds eye view of the crime scene at the end of the movie. The editing is fresh, used to great effect to bring out the visceral nature to Scorsese's work that we are so used to. While not as powerful as the work in Raging Bull, or as lively as Goodfellas, Taxi Driver is a calmer beast, taking its time in telling story and revealing the surroundings - which fits in well with the theme of the movie anyway.Scorsese also created the meticulously planned shooting at the end of the movie, which happens to be one of my favourite scenes ever. While not exactly polished (special effects in the 70's were used rarely), the gritty feeling really shines through, and although the blood is slightly saturated (to get certificate!) it is still highly violent. Set in the claustrophobic pimp house of Sport (Keitel) the scene just fizzes with energy, even if it contains as much dialogue as an early Chaplin movie.De Niro is frightening as Travis Bickle, the protagonist of the movie. He is so layered; the tics, the sayings, the feelings - De Niro has created someone so real, it is untrue. It's always the little details that stick out - like when De Niro puts his hand in his pocket (to reach for a gun?) during the president's election show - to spook out the guards. To see them running after him, as Bickle has a childish grin on his face is just priceless. To see this character burn slowly over the course of the film is something to experience. As I said at the start, Bicle is highly ambiguous, which I think is the best kind of character to have in a film, wherein the audience can decide weather or not he is hero or villain.Foster is great as the 12 and a half year old prostitute - a challenging role for any young actress. Cybill Shepherd, although slightly primitive in terms of acting skills, she suits the role well. The rest of the cast are superb too, with Keitel giving a sleazy performance as Sport, the pimp.So, where does this rank in Scorsese's already-really-amazing-CV? Certainly.

Junior did a lot of bad things throughout the film, scaring kids with a bear at the camping trip, destroying a birthday party, and clubbing baseball players in the nuggets. Ben and Flo are upset that Junior destroyed everything including Ben and Flo's reputations and now Ben can't be the baseball coach and Flo's friend Mrs. Henderson won't bother with the family after the birthday scene.

They were so mean. Flo wanted to have her own kid with Ben but unfortunately she was unable to conceive and ended up following Ben's idea of adopting a child. Mr. Peabody presented them with Junior, a 7-year-old red headed child. On his first day at his new home, his bedroom catches on fire when Ben and Flo introduce Big Ben to Junior. Right then and there Big Ben threatens Ben and Flo to get rid of Junior. Junior hears this and tosses the family cat at Big Ben which throws him down the stairs and gets rushed to the hospital. Junior did a lot of bad things throughout the film, scaring kids with a bear at the camping trip, destroying a birthday party, and clubbing baseball players in the nuggets. Ben and Flo are upset that Junior destroyed everything including Ben and Flo's reputations and now Ben can't be the baseball coach and Flo's friend Mrs. Henderson won't bother with the family after the birthday scene. The one part that I didn't like was when Ben went to the church to talk to the priest about Junior and a boy that Ben sold a canteen to at the sporting goods store that Big Ben owns tries to tell him about his wonderful camping trip he had, Ben is disinterested ( well angry because he couldn't have a good camping trip with Junior) and says Blow it out your a**). That was really crude I would say I love the scenes they deleted from the movie like in the beginning Flo and Ben were on their way to church and Flo was complaining that she was going to be everybody's slave because she can't have kids and she ended up cleaning Fuzzball's poop out of a lady's flower garden. then I liked when Ben tried to lay down the law with Junior about the terrible camping trip and then Ben slides on Junior's bucket of paint. That was hysterical. I also discovered a mystery part of the movie, in the part after Ben realizes that Junior liked Ben all along after taking a look at a drawing Junior did of Ben, there was a phone in Junior's bedroom and Junior called the number to get Ben to come over to release him with the money. That part was very interesting.

Because well, not a lot happens.The acting was good, very good in fact and Jodie Foster is one of the best actresses around and she puts in a studied performance and portrays an idealist scientist with compassion and verve admirably, so credit to her. This movie is far from a bad movie, and there are really intriguing aspects to it. There are many plot lines that could have been developed further, the aspect of the unknown could have been tapped into more, so too could have been the threat that a contact with an unknown quantity of alien life could be to our planet. This had a great opportunity to develop when the guy sacrificed himself with the bomb before the first mission. BUt they didn't go in depth of why he did it. They mentioned briefly through a news report he did it to save the human race, but the very next day she leaps on to the next ship regardless and went ahead with it. Thus taking away the dark themes that could have been presented.There is an awful lot of talking in the movie! and thats a good thing if they have something captivating to say, but a lot of the movie is talk without relative action. I mean I'm not askin for guns and lazers necessarily but a little more spark in the film would have been nice. Even the love interest which was focused on had no spark.Any relative emotion in this film was watered down or completely ignored, and there was an irritating emphasis on the media which was not well delivered by the director. I saw the directors point, the media has a huge part to play in US society, but they didn't do anything either-they didn't seem to be obtrusive and the characters payed little heed to them, so what was the point in its emphasis? when the guy blew himself up, to end the mission, one brief grieving scene from a news report was all they could come up with. The film makers can't get off that easy they need to try a little harder interms of creating emotion, suspense or intrigue to some degree.I felt the biggest cop-out was the end, with the film desperately in need of a boost they thought her trip through worm holes and space was enough and the prospect of an alien would wet our appetite. Her trip failed to be as breathtaking as it should have been, and it really did feel like were were watching a simulation programme. Regardless it was the most interesting bit in the movie. So she meets the alien, this was the movies last chance to cause a shock but in the end decided more talking was good enough. Thus we are presented with her dad, apparently the alien downloaded him from her brain and the alien in the form of her dad says to her  We thought this image would be easier for you, but i couldn't help but think the director basically just said 'We thought this image would be easier for us!' In other words little imagination was required and again fobbed the audience off with more muffled sentiment. This movie is neither here nor there in the end. It didn't know whether it wanted to be a drama or a news report from CNN either way it was long and turgid and about as captivating an experience as watching weeds grown on your back lawn.
