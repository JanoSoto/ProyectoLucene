[{"date":"11 July 2007","score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" You know that a science fiction film, like the new Steven Spielberg movie Minority Report starring Tom Cruise and Colin Farrell, is in trouble when the background elements are more interesting than the foreground elements. Based on a sci-fi short story by legendary author Philip K. Dick, whose writings have inspired Gary Felder's Impostor (2001), Ridley Scott's Blade Runner (1982), and Paul Verhoven's Total Recall (1990), Minority Report tops the inept Impostor but lacks the exciting agility of either Total Recall or Blade Runner. While the 'what if' premise of the Philip K. Dick short story and the script by Scott (Get Shorty) Frank and newcomer Jon Cohen provokes thought, director Steven Spielberg bungles both premise and promise. Not only does Spielberg wear out his welcome with an exhaustive epic that runs a half-hour too long, but also he botches what could have been the equal of any of his action-packed Raiders trilogy or The Lost World. Quite simply, Minority Report degenerates into a shallow, derivative sci-fi saga that bogs down too often in its own pseudo-technical gibberish and never delivers the hallowing hair-raising heroics that it promises. Minority Report unfolds in Washington, D.C., in the year 2054. Over the past six years, nobody has murdered anybody, thanks to a pioneering crime-prevention program called 'Pre-Crime' that can predict a homicide before it happens. Inventors Lamar Burgess (Max Von Sydow of The Exorcist) and Iris Hineman (Lois Smith of The Pledge) devised this system that relies on three psychics (one woman and two men) called Pre-Cogs buoyed in a wading pool who have visions of future crimes. The Justice Department dispatches Danny Witwer (Colin Farrell of American Outlaws) to check out the system before they adopt it for nation-wide use. Witwer suspects the system is flawed, no matter what Pre-Crime Chief John Anderton (Tom Cruise of Vanilla Sky) claims to the contrary. Suddenly, Anderton finds himself in a predicament when the Pre-Cogs say he has murder on his mind. Anderton is supposed to kill somebody that he has never met in the next 36 hours. Predictably, Anderton runs. Not only does he resist arrest, but also he kidnaps one of the Pre-Cogs, former crack-baby Agatha (Samantha Morton), who insists that he would kill and run. Along the way, we learn Anderton lost his son; uses illegal drugs, and is divorced.Spielberg blows it from the beginning with an action scene that wanders in circles. Things grow worse as the plot thickens, and we learn how the lottery style 'Pre-Crime System' works. At least ten continuity errors crop up, but what is worst is Spielberg never lets the action scenes off the leash. Instead, peripheral elements, such as the Magnetic Levitation traffic system that prevents traffic jams and the 'sick stick' that the cops use to incapacitate wrongdoers by making them instantly vomit, are more interesting than the contrived, drawn- out, convoluted story. Tom Cruise makes a convincingly vulnerable hero, but nothing about Minority Report is as convincing or insightful as his performance.

It can be argued, and many have, that Trumbull is probably the most important figure in modern Sci-Fi, creating the dark world of Blade Runner, the impressive but ultimately sterile Universe in 2001 and the awe-inspiring UFO scenes in Close Encounters of the Third Kind. But what many don't know is that Trumbull directed his own Sci-Fi film in 1972 named Silent Running. Given a relatively low budget, in comparison to 2001 and his later work Blade Runner, Trumbull would prove that the best work comes from people who have to make do with what little they have.Silent Running bequeaths the tale of a future Earth extinct of any plant life, with only a very few specimens having been saved in gargantuan space-bound greenhouses attached to a fleet of Space Freighters (the 'American Airline' of its day). These ships stay residing just outside the orbit of Saturn until Earth needs them back to reforest the planet. Bruce Dern, who plays Freeman Lowell, the appointed Head Gardner of the greenhouse-in-space, would rather spend time feeding his bunnies than hang out with his knucklehead crew. Well, unless there is a chance of embarrassing them at a game of Poker. However, when orders come in to nuke the remaining greenhouses and become a commercial airline once again, Lowell decides he would rather see his crew dead than watch the last remaining pieces of nature go into the light.What's truly amazing about Silent Running is how anti-sci-fi it is. Yes, there are some stunning visuals and it certainly looks to be a sci-fi movie, but ultimately this is a story about human beings. This is not the logic based evolutionary wanderings of 2001, neither does it have the philosophical vitality of Blade Runner or The Matrix. Silent Running is not concerned if the reality we are waking up to is in fact another form of illusion, or pondering about what makes us truly human. No, Silent Running is about a relatively simple person in an unremarkable situation. Lowell's basic choice is &#150; do I want human beings to survive, or my garden? He opts for the latter. There are too many human beings, anyway. But as the movie goes on Lowell finds that, although he can only find alienation with his own kind, he can't help but miss them.In fact, he misses them so much that his robot workers now go by the human names of Huey, Dewey and Louie. Notice I use the term 'robot' very loosely there. Due to Trumbull's budget what we in fact have are brightly coloured microwaves with rubber-gloved feet. But, my God, are they the most humanised robots ever depicted on screen. On first glance gentle snickering maybe heard from the back of your mind, but as time passes you grow so attached and loving towards these boxes that, when Lowell accidentally runs one over, it's as if your own son has been named road kill. This is such an amazing feature of Directing from Trumbull. Let's face it, anyone can make a robot seem more human when you cast humans as the robots. (Though, I did wonder whether Harrison Ford was in fact the Tin Man in Blade Runner). Trumbull intelligently creates a robot where the audience, as well as Lowell, have to project their own feelings, desires & hopes onto it, refraining from producing a fully formed and packaged robot for the viewer to consume blindly.But if you want to know why Silent Running truly works, then I'll tell you. It's the first and only sci-fi film that you will make you weep. No, not in the sense of Star Wars where you cry for the dim-witted romanticism, but where you actually break down in tears for the emotion shown on screen. This is not a dry, academic, logical maze that you have to weave yourself through, but a journey which you experience and learn from. Notice, I could have highlighted how Silent Running was ahead of its time due to it's forward-thinking ideas about nature and how we must always try to preserve it, if really only for it's unparallelled beauty. But I didn't. At the end of the day Silent Running is a treatise on the evil that we humans do to the planet. But, ironically, what makes this one of the greatest sci-fi films of all time is that it's not about spectacular visuals or interesting, dry technology, but about being so uniquely human.The end scene shows Lowell releasing his Garden from the space ship so the incoming Mother Ship cannot find the bodies of the people he has killed, and Lowell says to his friendly robot, in an almost Shakespearian tone, When I was a kid, I put a note into a bottle, and it had my name and address on it. I threw the bottle into the ocean. I never knew if anyone ever found it. With that Lowell triggers a bomb, sending himself in to the light, whilst the one remaining robot tends the love of his life, his garden, which floats quietly into the netherworlds of space. Will anyone out there ever find it?

Clearly, this catastrophic but conventional expose about a true-life incident in 1961, suppressed by the Kremlin until 1989, boasts everything anybody could hope for in a gripping disaster epic. During their historic maiden voyage on the first Soviet nuclear sub, the skipper and crew struggle desperately to repair the cooling system in its reactor after it repeatedly breaks down. Happily, the Soviet skipper and crew of K-19 solved this crisis before a cataclysmic thermonuclear blast could have vaporized them and triggered World War III. Not since Lewis Milestone's The North Star (1943) or Jacques Tourneur's Days of Glory (1944) has Hollywood celebrated the Communist exploits of the Soviet Union in such a heightened heroic fashion. The zombies of Joseph McCarthy, J. Edgar Hoover, and anyone who championed the House Un-American Activities Committee in the 1950s would rise from the dead and lynch the treasonous liberal revisionists who financed this better Red than dead yarn. Indeed, while this competently crafted, historically accurate, white-knuckled, undersea thriller won't win any Oscars, the filmmakers reveal a facet of the Cold War that few knew. Cross the Gene Hackman & Denzel Washington submarine nail-biter Crimson Tide (1995) with the Jack Lemmon & Jane Fonda nuclear meltdown melodrama The China Syndrome (1979), and you have a pretty good idea what to expect from Christopher Kyle's testosterone-fueled screenplay. K-19 opens as the Soviets commission their first atomic sub, so they can show the Kennedy administration that they can launch nuclear missiles at sea, too. Before the Russians take K-19 to sea, several construction workers die during freak accidents. Worse, the Kremlin replaces the commander, Capt. Mikhail Polenin (Liam Neeson of Star Wars Episode One), with legendary Capt. Alexei Vostrikov (Harrison Ford of Air Force One), and this last minute change of command enrages an already superstitious crew. Meanwhile, Vostrikov ignores bad omens galore, like the champagne bottle bouncing off the hull rather than shattering at the christening, and sets out to chart history. Not long after they dive beneath the waves, Vostrikov learns K-19 is far from being ship-shape. Nevertheless, like the Hackman skipper in Crimson Tide, Vostrikov runs his crew ragged with drills to sharpen their response time to emergencies. Suddenly, the worse thing that can happen occurs--the nuclear reactor overheats. Valiantly, the crew manages to cool the reactor. Not long afterward, however, the reactor blows another gasket, and the submariners stage a mutiny as a U.S. Navy destroyer lurks on the horizon.Director Kathryn Bigelow, whose credits include Near Dark (1987) and Strange Days (1995), adroitly piles one suspenseful situation atop another. Sixty-year old Harrison Ford makes a convincing but sympathetic Russian naval officer who refuses to scuttle the flagship of the Soviet fleet.

This lowbrow, redneck, laugh fest grounds itself in the rude, crude, lewd, bowel movement-oriented gross-out gags of comedian Adam Sandler. Not surprisingly, Sandler's production company 'Happy Madison,' which also made Deuce Bigelow Male Gigolo, produced Joe Dirt. Predictably, Joe Dirt (*** out of ****) appeals to the mentality of an 8-year old in its fixation with all kinds of fecal matter, fart jokes , and big-breasted babes. Strictly speaking, guys more than gals will guffaw at the juvenile escapades of our eponymous character. Although scatological humor dominates this picaresque tale about our thirty something protagonist's search for the ungrateful parents who abandoned him at age 8 at the Grand Canyon, David Spade's sympathetic but half- witted hillbilly hero towers memorably above those lowest-common-denominator-jests. Aside from Dennis Miller's hilarious but obnoxious jeers at Joe's appearance and pedigree, Joe Dirt shuns mean-spirited melodramatics and contents itself with showing how our resilient hero bounces back from more hurts than anybody should have to endure.Unlike many Saturday Night Live TV spin-off features, freshman director Dennie Gordon's Joe Dirt succeeds because the David Spade & Fred Wolf screenplay features an actual story. Moreover, instead of making the jokes as he has done in the past, David Spade becomes the butt of all the jokes. Everybody slings mud at Joe Dirt. Spade's character resembles Buster Keaton caught in an Adam Sandler comedy playing Rob Schneider pranks. Rarely does anybody get Joe Dirt's goat because he acts so incredibly ignorant that he doesn't know when somebody has been done him dirty. Our underdog hero displays so much heart you can't help but like him. You'll understand when you get a glimpse at this mullet-headed misfit. His mendacious mom made him wear a rock'n roll star's wig because she told him he lost the top of his skull at birth! So, you dig looking like Jane Fonda in 'Klute?' one of Joe's callous critics ridicules him. Joe sports pork chop sideburns and reads Auto Trader magazine as if it were Playboy. He dresses tattered, acid-washed jeans and rock group T-shirts, and drives a 1970's pathetic puke-yellow Barracuda with a chain steering wheel and a footprint gas pedal. Predictably, clouds of oily white smoke belch from his ride's tailpipe. Basically, Joe is blue-collar material, the world's worst loser who triumphs against all odds in the end. He lives by a simple philosophy all I have to do is keep being a good person and good things will come my way.Joe is mopping floors at Los Angeles radio station KXLA where Howard Stern-style shock jock Zander Kelly (Dennis Miller of Bordello of Blood) works when one of his producers spots Joe. No sooner has Zander seen and heard Joe than he invites him as a guest on his show. During next four days, Joe recounts the events that brought him to Los Angeles while enduring Kelly's worse jibes. After Joe's parents abandon him in a trash can at the Grand Canyon in 1975, our hero lives by his wits in the woods until a beautiful country girl, Brandy (Brittany Daniel of Basketball Diaries) befriends him. Their meeting occurs under the oddest circumstances, one evening when Joe finds her dog has somehow gotten his testicles frozen to her porch. Every time the poor critter moves, his scrotum stretches like taffy while his testicles remain stuck to the porch. Joe uses warm water and a spatula to free the grateful dog. Naturally, Brandy rewards him, and the two become close friends. Meanwhile, a local bully, Robby (Kid Rock), who drives a Trans-Am, and Brandy's own redneck papa (Joe Don Baker of Walking Tall) do everything to run Joe off. After Brandy's worthless father shoots her dog, Joe decides it's time to begin his search for his parents. He drives off with the dog's ashes in an urn suspended from the inside rear-view mirror of his car.Along the road to L.A., Joe encounters a variety of eccentric characters. He discovers a la George Romeo's 1982 Creepshow what he believes is a flaming meteor. Instead, he learns it is large heap of frozen waste matter from a jetliner. The scenes of Joe hauling the alleged meteor around in a little red wagon are hilarious because we believe it is a meteor, too, until a pawnshop owner points out the peanut. Later, Joe meets Kicking Wing (Adam Beach of Mystery, Alaska), an American Indian who sells only sparklers. Joe wants to hire him to track down his folks. At the same time, he convinces Kicking Wing to expand his fireworks business and sell more than sparklers. The highlight of their exploits involves an atomic bomb they think they have found that turns out to be a septic tank. Inevitably, Joe gets drenched with sewage. In another sidesplitting scene, Joe stumbles on to a Silence of the Lambs Buffalo Bob wannabe serial killer (Brian Thompson of Sudden Impact) and runs into a janitor (Christopher Walken of Sleepy Hollow) in the Witness Protection Program. Probably the best computer-generated graphics appear in the vignette at Rosanna Arquette's alligator farm. Joe sticks his head into a gator's jaws and gets all shook up for a crowd of tourists.Veteran TV director Dennie Gordon of Ally McBeal and Nash Bridges, strings this anthology of antics together and miraculously manages to make it work. Gordon knows when to resort to crude jokes and when to focus on Joe's underdog status, and she gets the most out of the least. Other amusing tidbits of Joe Dirt's philosophy that stick are Life is a garden, dig it. Although Joe shares obstacles similar to Forrest's, he isn't really on the same wavelength. One thing nobody can complain about is the collection of classic rock songs that make the soundtrack. If a soundtrack were ever worth buying, the Joe Dirt is. Meanwhile, don't believe the snotty critics who are shoveling manure on this merry little movie, Joe Dirt rises among the sod.

This derivative supernatural thriller about Satanic possession starring Winona Ryder has finally reared its accursed tale in theatres after New Line Cinema let it rot for more than a year in its studio vault. Originally, New Line had scheduled Lost Souls for release about this time last year, because Pierce Gardner's script dealt with the millennium. A similar array of movies, such as Stigmata, The Ninth Gate, Dogma, and End of Days convinced New Line to confine Souls in limbo.Were they ever right!Now, New Line faces stiffer competition with the re-release of The Exorcist, the scariest movie of all time. Brave lads that New Line are, they have concocted the silliest advertising campaign on record. Quoting their ad 'The Exorcist' scared your parents. That was then, 'Lost Souls' is now.' This atmospheric but anticlimactic drivel imitates better movies, like Rosemary's Baby, The Omen, and The Exorcist, but it lacks both the suspense and the anxiety a good horror movie needs to frighten audiences.Lost Souls starts well, but falls apart because the Devil wimps out in the end. A Catholic A-Team of exorcists led by Father Lareaux (John Hurt), Deacon John Townsend (Elias Koteas), Father Jeremy (James Lancaster) and secular exorcism survivor Maya Larkin (Winona Ryder), appear at a New York psychiatric hospital to perform an exorcism on convicted murderer Henry Birdson (John Diehl) at his own request. Unfortunately, not only do our heroes botch the exorcism, but also Father Lareaux emerges traumatized while Birdson lapses into a coma. Maya liberates reams of Birdson's numerology notes. Decoding them, she discovers Satan will reincarnate himself in the body of a bestselling author who writes about serial killers. Ironically, writer Peter Kelson (Ben Chaplin) refuses to believe in evil with a capital E. Nevertheless, he frets when Maya reveals that the Devil wants to possess him.Check around your bed, she warns. They usually leave a pentacle.Sure enough, the incredulous Kelson learns his sneaky girlfriend, Claire (Sarah Wynter), has placed a giant pentacle in the ceiling of the apartment directly beneath his bedroom. Meanwhile, Deacon Townsend tries to murder Peter. Eventually, Peter and Maya learn Satan will inhabit Kelson's body on his 33rd birthday.Souls tries to be subtle when it should be shrill. The elegant photography with its muted black & white palette detracts from the horror and suspense. The dangers are similarly muted, and the showdown between Maya and evil lacks ferocity. Two scenes where demons approach Maya in creepy ways contain enough dread to make your skin crawl. Chiefly, Kaminski evokes fear with loud sounds designed to scare the Beelzebub out of you. Brace yourself for the broken crucifixion scene because it's about as chilling as this mishmash gets. Basically, Lost Souls amounts to a forgettable chick flick version of End of Days.

This atmospheric but anticlimactic drivel imitates better movies, like Rosemary's Baby, The Omen, and The Exorcist, but it lacks both the suspense and the anxiety a good horror movie needs to frighten audiences.Lost Souls starts well, but falls apart because the Devil wimps out in the end. A Catholic A-Team of exorcists led by Father Lareaux (John Hurt), Deacon John Townsend (Elias Koteas), Father Jeremy (James Lancaster) and secular exorcism survivor Maya Larkin (Winona Ryder), appear at a New York psychiatric hospital to perform an exorcism on convicted murderer Henry Birdson (John Diehl) at his own request. Unfortunately, not only do our heroes botch the exorcism, but also Father Lareaux emerges traumatized while Birdson lapses into a coma. Maya liberates reams of Birdson's numerology notes. Decoding them, she discovers Satan will reincarnate himself in the body of a bestselling author who writes about serial killers. Ironically, writer Peter Kelson (Ben Chaplin) refuses to believe in evil with a capital E. Nevertheless, he frets when Maya reveals that the Devil wants to possess him.Check around your bed, she warns. They usually leave a pentacle.Sure enough, the incredulous Kelson learns his sneaky girlfriend, Claire (Sarah Wynter), has placed a giant pentacle in the ceiling of the apartment directly beneath his bedroom. Meanwhile, Deacon Townsend tries to murder Peter. Eventually, Peter and Maya learn Satan will inhabit Kelson's body on his 33rd birthday.Souls tries to be subtle when it should be shrill. The elegant photography with its muted black & white palette detracts from the horror and suspense. The dangers are similarly muted, and the showdown between Maya and evil lacks ferocity. Two scenes where demons approach Maya in creepy ways contain enough dread to make your skin crawl. Chiefly, Kaminski evokes fear with loud sounds designed to scare the Beelzebub out of you. Brace yourself for the broken crucifixion scene because it's about as chilling as this mishmash gets. Basically, Lost Souls amounts to a forgettable chick flick version of End of Days.

Although it lacks the depth and intelligence of Bryan Singer's X-Men, Spider-man compares favorably with Richard Donner's standard-bearing epic Superman (1978). Each poked fun at themselves in straight-faced fashion, but neither let their villains overshadow the heroes as Tim Burton did in his Michael Keaton Batman yarns. The offbeat but inspired casting of Tobey Maguire as Spider-man and Willem Dafoe as the villainous Green Goblin virtually compensates for two unforgivable flaws which neither Raimi nor veteran scripter David Koepp resolve in an entirely satisfactory manner. Meanwhile, John Dykstra of the original Star Wars serves up some credible digital special effects that allow audiences to websling their way vicariously through the Big Apple with Spidey. Happily, these CGI sequences seamlessly integrate with Maguire's dialogue scenes in his red & blue, body stocking costume. Shrewdly, Raimi and Koepp obliterate the Spider- man mask during the climactic fight, so Maquire's personality enlivens his heroic posturings. Spider-man follows the Superman formula about Spidey's origins, so you need not be a Marvel Comics arachnophile to enjoy this blockbuster. The action unfolds in a high school setting like Can't Hardly Wait with dorky protagonist, Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire of Wonder Boys) warning the fainthearted about the trials and tribulations that confound a superhero. When we meet him, Peter is obsessed with class beauty Mary Jane Watson (cleavage-baring Kirsten Dunst of Small Soldiers), but she doesn't know he exists. They live next door to each other and attend the same senior high in the New York City borough of Queens. The jocks harass Peter unmercifully, but he survives their ridicule with no ill effects. Things change dramatically on a class field trip to Columbia University. A 'genetically designed super spider' bites Peter. When he awakens the following morning, Peter discovers to his disbelief that he no longer needs glasses and has a weight lifter's physique. Miraculously, he finds he can squirt webs out of his wrists and scale walls. Not long afterward, the Green Goblin, a power-hungry maniac on a jet glider who wreaks havoc wherever he flies, confronts Spidey and invites him to team up as his partner-in-crime. Of course, Spider-man refuses, and Goblin attacks Spider-man's aunt and his girlfriend Mary Jane.The worst thing about Spider-man is our hero cuts a rather dull figure when we cannot see Tobey Maguire's expressive countenance. The only time Hollywood conceals movie stars is when stunt men double for them. The first half of Spider-man surpasses the second half, because the complexity of the former abates during the latter. Inexplicably, Goblin neglects to unmask and\/or kill Spidey after he captures him! Later, during a standoff involving a detached cable car, Goblin forces Spidey to choose who to rescue his girlfriend Mary Jane or the cable car passengers.

No, Resurrection doesn't surpass director John Carpenter's peerless slice'n dice classic Halloween (1978), which launched unknown actress Jamie Lee Curtis into the Hollywood firmament as scream queen Laurie Strode. Yes, Resurrection tops 1983's Halloween III Season of the Witch. Nevertheless, this derivative but efficient follow-up to the much superior Halloween H2O (1998), the second-best Halloween epic since Carpenter's original, piles up a reasonable body count, stirs up serviceable suspense, and features one of the more memorable moments (or the mother of all false alarms) of the franchise.Halloween Resurrection fades in three years after H2O faded out. Evidently, Laurie believed she had beheaded her murderous younger brother, the unstoppable killing machine Michael Myers. Sadly, she learns to her shock that Michael swapped places with a paramedic. Macabre Michael crushed the guy's larynx, so he couldn't identify himself when Laurie hacked off his head. Consequently, the authorities have locked up poor Laurie in the loony bin . Meanwhile, when she isn't stashing her pills in a rag doll, guilt-ridden Laurie awaits her inevitable showdown with her big, bad bogeyman brother. Fifteen minutes later, Laurie confronts Michael (career stunt man Brad Loree), and you can guess who triumphs in their rooftop encounter. Hopefully, the proposed ninth chapter in the Halloween movies may rewrite Laurie's untimely demise the same way Resurrection shrewdly revived Michael. Director Rick Rosenthal, who helmed Halloween 2 (1981), shifts the action from the insane asylum to the dilapidated Strode family domicile in Haddonfield, Illinois, where all the bloodletting began.

Harris recruits six unsuspecting college students to appear on his Internet cybercast 'Dangertainment.' He promises them $5,000 apiece if they can survive a night in Michael's house.

While Michael isn't knocking off these nitwits with his customary sadism, Sara's cyber-pen pal Myles Barton (Ryan Merriman) is typing out and sending messages frantically to Sara on her Palm-Pilot, warning our heroine about Myers' whereabouts. Halloween Resurrection combines The House on Haunted Hill with The Blair Witch Project. The formulaic screenplay by Larry Brand and Sean Hood ignores the slasher movie rules about sex and drugs that Wes Craven's Scream trilogy outlined years ago. Gore- hounds looking for buckets of blood in the R-rated Resurrection may feel cheated by the overall lack of slash and gash. The best parts of Resurrection have little to do with horror and more to do with keeping this mass murder melodrama up-to-date with the latest advances in technological hardware.

I don't know exactly how many times I watched it, but definitely several times. Years later, after seeing that the IMDb rating for Jungle 2 Jungle was low, I finally watched it again, for the first time in I don't know how long, and like I expected, it no longer meant much to me.Michael Cromwell is a commodities broker in New York. It has been years since his wife, Patricia left him, and he now has a new fiancé, but before they can marry, he must go down to the Amazon (where his first wife now lives), to make the divorce official. While there, Michael learns that he has a son, who is part of the primitive tribe that Patricia now lives with! His name is Mimi-Siku, and while Michael is stuck on the island, the boy turns thirteen, the age which he is considered a man in this tribe. Mimi is assigned by the tribe's chief to go to New York and get the fire from the Statue of Liberty, so Michael reluctantly takes his son home with him. Mimi-Siku has always lived very primitively, and has never experienced city life, so while in New York, he is bound to unintentionally cause trouble! Watching Jungle 2 Jungle after my adolescent years had come and gone, I didn't find it very funny at all. I smiled a few times (mostly the parts where Richard Kempster, Michael Cromwell's co-worker, played by comedian Martin Short, throws fits) but if I ever actually laughed, it was very slight, and if I saw the gag again, I probably wouldn't laugh at all. For the most part, I kept a straight face, and found most of the movie quite simply boring.

This far- fetched, fast-paced, family-friendly fare fuses over-the-top 007 action sequences with childhood classics like Chitty Chitty Bang Bang and Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. Surprisingly, writer & director Robert Rodriguez's whimsically eccentric but warmly entertaining comedy thriller doesn't pander with the usual lowest common denominator humor and histrionics. Newcomers Alexa Vega and Daryl Sabara behave neither like obnoxious ragamuffins nor precocious brats. Rodriguez forgoes the farce of the Home Alone movies and the flatulence of See Spot Run. Instead, he treats us to a yarn as wholly innocent as it is implausibly outlandish. Not only does Spy Kids qualify as a must-see for twelve-year-olds, but also Rodriguez has revamped the kids' action movie genre with style to spare! Spy Kids unfolds in the near future. Espionage agents have replaced armies, and Gregorio (Antonio Banderas of Desperado) and Ingrid (Carla Gugino of Snake Eyes) are the best. As spies on opposite sides, they receive orders to kill each other. Ironically, they fall in love, resign, marry, and raise two elementary school age children Carmen (Alexa Vega) and Juni (Daryl Sabara). Now, our ex-spies serve strictly as consultants, until several secret agents vanish without a trace. Gregorio launches a search, and Ingrid accompanies him. No sooner have they entrusted their kids to Felix Gumm (Cheech Marin Up In Smoke) than chief villain Fegan Floop (Alan Cumming) traps our adult duo. Fegan Floop masquerades as a loopy Willy Wonka type villain with his own popular children's TV show called Floop's Fooglies. Imagine Pee-Wee Herman on the prowl. Floop operates from an offshore castle shaped like an old battered boot with a candelabrum of Disney-like towers sprouting from it. Floop kidnapped those secret agents and mutated them into bizarre circus freak characters. Behind the scenes, Floop and Dr. Alexander Minion (Tony Shalhoub of Monk) scheme to replace the children of celebrities and world leaders with robotic clones. Mr. Lisp (Robert Patrick of Terminator 2) wants to buy them, so he can dominate the world. Dastardly Floop sends agents after Carmen and Juni, but the siblings elude his Thumb henchmen. Literally, these guys are all thumbs thumbs for heads, hands, and legs. Carmen and Juni fill their parents' shoes and thwart evil.Director Robert Rodriguez, whose credits include Desperado, From Dusk Till Dawn, Four Rooms, Road Racers, and The Faculty, has come a long way since 1992's El Mariachi. Typically, he saturates his sagas with buckets of blood & gore, so watching the sanitary PG-rated Spy Kids comes as quite a revelation. Aside from an occasional outburst of violence, Spy Kids poses as little a threat as a Barney episode. Nevertheless, Rodriguez stages these melodramatics with such skillful cinematic virtuosity that you find yourself sucked in by the momentum of the action. Indeed, Spy Kids qualifies as a superbly made, larger-than-life Wizard of Oz with gadgets galore that celebrates family values.

Now, our ex-spies serve strictly as consultants, until several secret agents vanish without a trace. Gregorio launches a search, and Ingrid accompanies him. No sooner have they entrusted their kids to Felix Gumm (Cheech Marin Up In Smoke) than chief villain Fegan Floop (Alan Cumming) traps our adult duo. Fegan Floop masquerades as a loopy Willy Wonka type villain with his own popular children's TV show called Floop's Fooglies. Imagine Pee-Wee Herman on the prowl. Floop operates from an offshore castle shaped like an old battered boot with a candelabrum of Disney-like towers sprouting from it. Floop kidnapped those secret agents and mutated them into bizarre circus freak characters. Behind the scenes, Floop and Dr. Alexander Minion (Tony Shalhoub of Monk) scheme to replace the children of celebrities and world leaders with robotic clones. Mr. Lisp (Robert Patrick of Terminator 2) wants to buy them, so he can dominate the world. Dastardly Floop sends agents after Carmen and Juni, but the siblings elude his Thumb henchmen. Literally, these guys are all thumbs thumbs for heads, hands, and legs. Carmen and Juni fill their parents' shoes and thwart evil.Director Robert Rodriguez, whose credits include Desperado, From Dusk Till Dawn, Four Rooms, Road Racers, and The Faculty, has come a long way since 1992's El Mariachi. Typically, he saturates his sagas with buckets of blood & gore, so watching the sanitary PG-rated Spy Kids comes as quite a revelation. Aside from an occasional outburst of violence, Spy Kids poses as little a threat as a Barney episode. Nevertheless, Rodriguez stages these melodramatics with such skillful cinematic virtuosity that you find yourself sucked in by the momentum of the action. Indeed, Spy Kids qualifies as a superbly made, larger-than-life Wizard of Oz with gadgets galore that celebrates family values. ","genre":"Action, Adventure, Comedy"},{"date":"11 July 2007","score":"","review":" The pint-sized protagonists in Sky Kids do the darnedest things to save their imperiled parents from a mad scientist and his indestructible army of android urchins. This far- fetched, fast-paced, family-friendly fare fuses over-the-top 007 action sequences with childhood classics like Chitty Chitty Bang Bang and Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. Surprisingly, writer & director Robert Rodriguez's whimsically eccentric but warmly entertaining comedy thriller doesn't pander with the usual lowest common denominator humor and histrionics. Newcomers Alexa Vega and Daryl Sabara behave neither like obnoxious ragamuffins nor precocious brats. Rodriguez forgoes the farce of the Home Alone movies and the flatulence of See Spot Run. Instead, he treats us to a yarn as wholly innocent as it is implausibly outlandish. Not only does Spy Kids qualify as a must-see for twelve-year-olds, but also Rodriguez has revamped the kids' action movie genre with style to spare! Spy Kids unfolds in the near future. Espionage agents have replaced armies, and Gregorio (Antonio Banderas of Desperado) and Ingrid (Carla Gugino of Snake Eyes) are the best. As spies on opposite sides, they receive orders to kill each other.

It had tons of gore, creature effects, 80s cheese and it provided an explanation and reason as to why The Blob came here, a mystery many people wanted to know. In this one, it did not come from space. I, however, was horribly frightened by this movie when I was younger and I saw when the blob ate Meg Penny's boyfriend in the clinic. Now when I'm 18 and I watch this movie, I have a deeper appreciation for what was a flop then, but now a huge cult classic. This film did not have great acting, but it wasn't the worst and as far as the love plot that's at the gooey center of all the blood and wax, it like anything else that I've seen in on WGN. But I love this movie anyway, despite that.What I especially enjoyed was the violence and the gore that was mega upped in this version. This aspect is what really scared me. They really emphasized on how vicious and acidic the blob really is that the original portrayed it as. Don't get me wrong, I am a huge fan of the original but I think this one really heightened the intensity that the blob has over humans. There are points were the gore can be ridiculously amazing and unnecessary (i.e. it involves a kitchen sink and a projection booth). Not even kids are safe or innocent in the demented eye of the blob, which was stunning. They managed to keep in infamous theater scene and upped the gore in it, what made this scene even more intense was the strobe effect that they used. There weren't any jump out scares in this film as there is bloody scares. I think if they added this, it would be a whole lot scarier but thank God it's rumored that there is a remake coming out in 2010.Another great aspect of this movie is the multiple plot outlines that overlap each other numerous times throughout. It has a very wooden love story that has a predictable end and a very worn out rising action, but what separates this love tale from the others is how the love tale begins. Just when you think that the hot quarterback is going to be the hero, he isn't&#133;..anything&#133;..anymore. What I want to applaud is the whole story behind the blob and it's mysterious crash appearance. Honestly, I thought it was an alien but I was dead wrong. Though, because of this plot, it had a very presentable theme of America's ridiculous extreme measures towards the Cold War. There are also some mini plots throughout this movie that just when you think that they may lead somewhere, it's gets cutoff by the blob. Absolutely fantastic.What this movie did not have is good acting, but it did not have horrible acting, it had okay acting in some sense. There were some notable one-lines by Kevin Dillon and Shawnee Smith (i.e. Trying to keep there leftovers fresh). There is some horrible acting by Joe Seneca, Paul McCrane and Donovan Leitch but a great performance by Del Close who plays Reverend Meeker. Though his character has a very small part, later on in the movie his character becomes dark and sets up for a sequel to The Blob. His performance was haunting and charismatic. There was just something about his character that made him uncomfortable but heartwarming at the same time.Overall, I think this movie was a pebble-stone in American horror and will always go down as a true American Cult Classic. Despite some of the crucial elements that make a good horror movie were not met in this movie, it still was a good ride that is very memorable. In the end isn't that what makes a great 80s movie, a movie with an okay plot, some wooden acting, a lot of blood, a remake, something to do with biochemicals or mutations and Shawnee Smith? I think it is. I think that this is a movie that is worth checking out to horror fans of all kinds, but for little horror fans, this may be a bit tense to view. What I especially like is the end credit music, the song Brave New Love by Alien, which was a Swedish band that died in 89' but had great music. It was a very unknown band, but I'm glad it was in The Blob.

Absolutely fantastic.What this movie did not have is good acting, but it did not have horrible acting, it had okay acting in some sense. There were some notable one-lines by Kevin Dillon and Shawnee Smith (i.e. Trying to keep there leftovers fresh). There is some horrible acting by Joe Seneca, Paul McCrane and Donovan Leitch but a great performance by Del Close who plays Reverend Meeker. Though his character has a very small part, later on in the movie his character becomes dark and sets up for a sequel to The Blob. His performance was haunting and charismatic. There was just something about his character that made him uncomfortable but heartwarming at the same time.Overall, I think this movie was a pebble-stone in American horror and will always go down as a true American Cult Classic. Despite some of the crucial elements that make a good horror movie were not met in this movie, it still was a good ride that is very memorable. In the end isn't that what makes a great 80s movie, a movie with an okay plot, some wooden acting, a lot of blood, a remake, something to do with biochemicals or mutations and Shawnee Smith? I think it is. I think that this is a movie that is worth checking out to horror fans of all kinds, but for little horror fans, this may be a bit tense to view. What I especially like is the end credit music, the song Brave New Love by Alien, which was a Swedish band that died in 89' but had great music. It was a very unknown band, but I'm glad it was in The Blob.

It had tons of gore, creature effects, 80s cheese and it provided an explanation and reason as to why The Blob came here, a mystery many people wanted to know. In this one, it did not come from space. I, however, was horribly frightened by this movie when I was younger and I saw when the blob ate Meg Penny's boyfriend in the clinic. Now when I'm 18 and I watch this movie, I have a deeper appreciation for what was a flop then, but now a huge cult classic. This film did not have great acting, but it wasn't the worst and as far as the love plot that's at the gooey center of all the blood and wax, it like anything else that I've seen in on WGN. But I love this movie anyway, despite that.What I especially enjoyed was the violence and the gore that was mega upped in this version. This aspect is what really scared me. They really emphasized on how vicious and acidic the blob really is that the original portrayed it as. Don't get me wrong, I am a huge fan of the original but I think this one really heightened the intensity that the blob has over humans. There are points were the gore can be ridiculously amazing and unnecessary (i.e. it involves a kitchen sink and a projection booth). Not even kids are safe or innocent in the demented eye of the blob, which was stunning. They managed to keep in infamous theater scene and upped the gore in it, what made this scene even more intense was the strobe effect that they used. There weren't any jump out scares in this film as there is bloody scares. I think if they added this, it would be a whole lot scarier but thank God it's rumored that there is a remake coming out in 2010.Another great aspect of this movie is the multiple plot outlines that overlap each other numerous times throughout. It has a very wooden love story that has a predictable end and a very worn out rising action, but what separates this love tale from the others is how the love tale begins. Just when you think that the hot quarterback is going to be the hero, he isn't&#133;..anything&#133;..anymore. What I want to applaud is the whole story behind the blob and it's mysterious crash appearance. Honestly, I thought it was an alien but I was dead wrong. Though, because of this plot, it had a very presentable theme of America's ridiculous extreme measures towards the Cold War. There are also some mini plots throughout this movie that just when you think that they may lead somewhere, it's gets cutoff by the blob.

Anyway, to humour his girlfriend into saving their doomed relationship he agrees to be hypotised in the name of therapy. Anyway, the therapist keels over from a heart attack before he can snap Peter out of it, so Peter remains in this very relaxed kind of trance, and decides that if he hates his job, he's just not gonna go anymore.

Usually Caan plays tough-guy cops and gangsters. In this role, he was a kindly high school teacher in Chicago. The very best part of the movie was in the first few minutes. It was critical to the point of the whole movie. Caan's Kieran Johnson is teaching history at a Chicago high school and his students are disrespecting him and making fun of him. Johnson brings up the stats on how many of them will end up having a long-term job and how many will end up in jail. I loved this, because it showed that Ireland in 1939 was not totally alien from America in 1998. There were problems in Ireland, just like there are problems today in America. The movie was basically about how hardship and class tensions create an inhuman atmosphere for all involved. Johnson has never known whom his father was. His mother is very old, and has already had a stroke. Johnson can no longer ask his Mom about who his Dad really was. So, Johnson goes to the village where his Mom came from in Ireland. He stays at a bed and breakfast where an elderly woman there retells the whole story of his parents. Johnson father was a very nice man, who was a victim of his class and his position in society. He was a lowly laborer. His parents have a farm that is owned by a widow woman with a daughter. The father has died by this time, and was in the military (a position of some prestige in Ireland at the time). I really felt for Aidan Quinn's portrait of the mysterious lost father of Johnson. He was kindly and loved the daughter of the owner of his parents' farm with all his heart. Stephen Rea plays the firebrand priest of the Catholic Church in the village. Rea's priest shows how blind religiosity can actually destroy decent people's lives. The parents of Johnson weren't even able to get married! It was a sin to have any relations between a man and woman, unless you were of the right class. This movie horribly shows how a decent man (Aidan Quinn) is completely disenfranchised and criminalized for being truly in love with a woman. John Cusack comes in as an American journalist-pilot. Cusack highlights how in Ireland at the time, America was seen as an escape from their miserable lives of conformity. Cusack talks about Greta Garbo, whom Johnson's Mom adores in 1939. Garbo represented a liberated woman in 1939. The Irish couldn't dream of such a thing in those days. I really loved this movie, because it was honest and truthful. Ireland wasn't all romantic, like many movies show it as. In addition, the movie showed that things were and are never great. At the beginning, Johnson is shown in 1990s Chicago. There is great tension and issues going on in Johnson's life. So, Ireland of the 30s was not totally different from today's World. There is still the issue of resources. There are still problems in all families, whether 30s Ireland or today's America.

He would give the role the depth it requires.Perhaps they will listen to my suggestions and make the proper adjustments in Karate Kid 5. Its too Pat Marita is no longer. I was thinking maybe Justin Guarini is the perfect replacement for the lovable Asian fellow Mr. Miyagi. He will give Wax on wax off a whole new meaning. HAHAHAHAHAHA funny huh? Anyways, if you are looking for an exciting movie filled with Karate and triumph of the human spirit, Karate Kid 4 is for you. Don't waste your time with 1-3. This is the Karate Kid for you! This is the Karate Kid for r the ages! ","genre":"Action, Drama, Family"}]
