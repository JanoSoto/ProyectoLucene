The search lasts many years and the uncle is joined by the girl's stepbrother (Jeffrey Hunter) who doesn't know what he's getting into or the true motives of the uncle. When people discuss THE SEARCHERS it's usually for two reasons. The first and most important thing is that it's one of the greatest Westerns ever made. The second reason people talk about the film is its controversy of racism but I must say I've never really understood this. Yes, the Wayne character is a racist and yes he doesn't have much good to him but I'm sure there were many people in his train of thought back when this film took place. I've never really had a problem with the Ethan character because we're given a good guy to go up against his racist thoughts at all time so I've honestly never seen the big deal. In fact, I'd say this really makes the film as great as it is because it gives the two characters much more to deal with and I think it adds some great tension to the film as well as something to think and talk about. I'd also say that the film is one of the greatest looking ever made. You really could mute the film and not pay any attention to the story and still be blown away simply by the visuals. The beautiful skies of Monument Valley and the beautiful scenes in the snow are some of the most amazing you're ever going to witness in a film. Of course it doesn't help that we have Wayne delivering one of his strongest and greatest roles. The actor does a terrific job with the part because while you hate his thoughts you still can't help but support him. Hunter isn't quite in the same league but I thought he handled his character quite well and especially some of the lighter moments. Vera Miles is good in her part of the love interest and Natalie Wood is good in her few moments. The supporting cast are all very good in their roles and they really add to the film. Ford's direction hits all the right marks including the early raid\/kidnapping, which we never really see. I really respect the way that Ford just showed the build-up and he managed to make it very intense. THE SEARCHERS is one of the greatest Westerns ever made and it has the director-star at the top of their game.

For the longest time I had Star Wars as my number one movie, but Princess Mononoke instantly bumped it out of first place. The plot line was amazing, and the acting was superb. The voice actors, both the Japanese and the English dub did an amazing job of getting the emotion that needed to be portrayed felt by the audience. You could hear the subtleties in their voices that let you know there was a change in how the person felt. I great example was when Ashitaka was leaving his village his sister came up to say goodbye. She joked around with Ashitaka, but quickly became sad, and you could feel the mood change when it did. If you listen to how she talked her voice had a minimal change in sound, but it was just enough that you felt the pain in your heart of how sad it was that she was never going to see Ashitaka again. Another time you can see, actually hear, the amazing voice acting is when Ashitaka talks to lady Eboshi for the first time. The power in his voice when he says, to see with eyes unclouded by hate, drives home the feeling that he is serious about what he does and that he lives by that phrase. Watching other animated movies, I had never felt the emotions spoken so well as I did watching Princess Mononoke. Thinking about it, another part that helped drive emotions home was the astounding soundtrack composed by Joe Hisaishi. The soundtrack that plays throughout the movie is beautiful. It helps bring to life the emotions felt and helps tell the story. You feel like if you closed your eyes, turned off the dialogue and just listened to the soundtrack, you would still know the story. It almost seems like the soundtrack tells the story as its own entity. The swells of the strings, the woody vibrato of the Oboe, the shimmer of the harp all bring the spiritual world shown in Princess Mononoke to life. The final point I want to make about this movie is the images that you see. It astounds me how every frame of this movie was hand drawn. 160,000 frame cells were drawn, a number I can't even fathom. Miyazaki brought to life the world he envisioned with the moving art that he called Princess Mononoke. When you see the forest gods walking around you can't help but be in awe. I suggest you buy this movie and watch it over and over. It brings great fantasy and happiness while bringing powerful ideas to the table.

In the current times, Michael (Al Pacino) survives an assassination attempt and goes to find out who was behind it as well as destroy anyone who might be trying to do the family any harm. There's always going to be a debate on whether this film or the first is the best but for my money I have to hand it to this sequel. While both movies are great, I think this one works so well for numerous reasons but the biggest being that not only is a great sequel by continuing the events of the first film but it's also a great prequel by showing the life of Vito.I've always had a few minor problems with the original movie but I think it would be fair to say that this one here is flawless in every way. Coppola does such a masterful job at making sure everything was on par with the original but you can tell he knew people were going to be questioning him attempting to do a sequel so he wanted to make sure that he delivered even more. As with the first film, this one here has that very slow pace that wouldn't be allowed in any movie today but thankfully the 70s were a much different time. Coppola perfectly uses this slower pacing to really get inside the heads of these people and he really delivers so much character development that you're amazed that so much is able to be done in its epic 200-minute running time. Even more amazing is how quickly the film flies by, which is saying a lot of consider the length and pace.Of course, no one could ever say a negative thing about the performances and they're all masterful. I had really forgotten how wonderful Pacino was here but he's so chilling, cold and deadly quiet that you really do begin to fear him. I'm certainly not going to spoil anything but if you've seen the movie then you know what happens at the end and how Pacino plays this was just a masterful touch. DeNiro, picking up his first Oscar, does a wonderful job too. Doing the Italian language and mastering is obviously impressive but so are the small touches that he brings that connects the character to the later one played by Marlon Brando in the previous film. John Cazale is often overlooked but he has some terrific moments here as does Talia Shire, Robert Duvall and especially Diane Keaton.THE GODFATHER PART II contains all the greatness of the first film and it's a real miracle that Coppola was able to match it and deliver even more. The film works on so many levels but being able to pretty much see two movies rolled into one is something of a lost art. Even rarer is how perfectly both parts are as the drama, tension, violence and pain are all on full display and there's no question that this film deserves its reputation as one of the greatest ever made.

It had 5 Oscars including the Best Picture4 Oscar nominations thrown in for good measure too.It was a good film but I was not totally satisfied with it to be very honest. It had no business being so long for starters. The first act and the third act could have been trimmed for about an hour more in the former than the later(40 in the first 20 in the third I guess would have made the film a world of good). Especially the first act was not doing much and in its entirety it shows the bonding between the friends amidst of a overtly long wedding scene at the church. True, the camaraderie and their relationship needed to be established, but an hour devoted only for that aspect of the film is a little demanding on the patience all the time promising of better things to come.The second act was brilliant and is dearly and deservedly remembered by everyone who saw it. The acting, direction, cinematography were absolutely top notch and everyone was in command of their craft. This segment itself might have won this film all its Oscars. It culminates at a point where the three friends at different stages of exhaustion, escape from the prison camp and were rescued.The third act traces their life back to their home town in Penssylvania where Mike who survived the war is welcomed enthusiastically back into his friends' lives but he has no idea of his other two buddies. He learns of their survival ,meets one of them(Stevie) who got his legs amputated and brings him back to his family. He finds his other friend Nick (Christopher Walken in an Oscar winning role) to be somewhere in Saigon and leaves to rescue him true to his word. The ending shows the survivors and friends singing God Bless America. Somewhere among this, there was Linda (Meryl Streep), Nick's fiancée with whom Mike seems to develop a relationship.The direction and acting are quite flawless and deserve all the accolades. There were some real poignant moments in the film but they were not few but certainly far between. Also, the film occasionally seems to spell out the emotions for its viewers specially towards the end of the first act.

It is a 70s film starring De Niro when he was at his absolute best in every role he played 3. It had 5 Oscars including the Best Picture4 Oscar nominations thrown in for good measure too.It was a good film but I was not totally satisfied with it to be very honest. It had no business being so long for starters. The first act and the third act could have been trimmed for about an hour more in the former than the later(40 in the first 20 in the third I guess would have made the film a world of good). Especially the first act was not doing much and in its entirety it shows the bonding between the friends amidst of a overtly long wedding scene at the church. True, the camaraderie and their relationship needed to be established, but an hour devoted only for that aspect of the film is a little demanding on the patience all the time promising of better things to come.The second act was brilliant and is dearly and deservedly remembered by everyone who saw it. The acting, direction, cinematography were absolutely top notch and everyone was in command of their craft. This segment itself might have won this film all its Oscars. It culminates at a point where the three friends at different stages of exhaustion, escape from the prison camp and were rescued.The third act traces their life back to their home town in Penssylvania where Mike who survived the war is welcomed enthusiastically back into his friends' lives but he has no idea of his other two buddies. He learns of their survival ,meets one of them(Stevie) who got his legs amputated and brings him back to his family. He finds his other friend Nick (Christopher Walken in an Oscar winning role) to be somewhere in Saigon and leaves to rescue him true to his word.

I knew it was Tom Cruise as the sport's agent Jerry Maguire, but never really knew the ins and outs of it. I was quite surprised to find out it has a good hint of comedy in it, and isn't as sporty as I thought it was. I was shocked when I sat down to watch this.The film begins showing Maguire as a hot shot agent, who represents many top sport stars across the country. One night however he has an epiphany and writes a 'mission statement' about how his agency should worry about the cliental instead of the money. He posts this 25 page mission statement in everybody at the company's pigeon hole and is greeted at work the next day with a huge round of applause. The big bosses of the company though don't agree with his document and instantly fire him, to be fair why would a company earning millions want to stop earning millions? After being fired he heads off to set up his own business, but first tries to persuade his current sport stars to come with him. They all choose to stay with their current representation, apart from one who is willing to still use Mr Maguire as his agent, Rod Tidwell (Gooding Jr). Maguire's company consists of himself and, an assistant who followed him from his former job, Dorothy (Zellweger). The company gets off to a bad start when the biggest football star in the country drops him and goes with Maguire's former company, leaving Maguire to put all his worth into Tidwell, who is an egotistical footballer with a severe attitude problem. As the film goes on Maguire and Dorothy begin to fall for one another, and Tidwell becomes more of a friend than a client. Maguire and Tidwell, who both have different views on life, manage to teach each other subconsciously how to be the men that will make their career flourish. It isn't really a film about sport, it is more about the relationship people have, and especially since it is stated, Maguire struggling to be alone but lacking intimacy with anyone he is close to. The themes are deep, much deeper than a typical sports movie.The script for the film is very good. The characters are so well drawn, and each one manages to bring something to the forefront, all to aid in Jerry Maguire's development as a person. The character of Tidwell is a great character and he is so pivotal for the outcome of this movie. The characters are also aided by some great acting. Cruise is very good in his role here, and is utterly believable as Maguire. He has the look and the mannerisms of an arrogant sports agent. Tom Hanks was originally slated for the role, but Cruise is definitely the right choice for it. Cuba Gooding Jr. is very good as Tidwell. He is over the top, brash and smitten with his wife. Gooding Jr. brings this character to life so well and thoroughly deserved his Oscar for Supporting Actor that year. Zellweger is also on top form as Dorothy. Her scenes with Cruise are full of emotion, and their chemistry is full of romance, despite one very uncomfortable scene where he kisses her all over on the doorstep. She is clearly in love with Maguire, and Zellweger shows this very well.The film does have a good script and a strong cast but it isn't the best movie out there. The best this movie could possibly be is average. It is an easy watch but the middle sector especially is a little dull. The opening of the film, where we see Maguire have a slight breakdown, is good but it begins to run out of puff towards the end. It is a fairly long film and probably doesn't need to be. The end has a strange climax, and I wander why Tidwell manages to become a bigger star due to him having an injury on the pitch. It was something I just didn't understand. At the end they also announce Tidwell's new contract on the air of a television show, would they do that? Why would people want to hear about it? If anything I would say that would put fans off of him. Here it was pushing the audience to love the football star but why would you be happy for him securing a huge contract. Small issues with this film really bring it down. It isn't a bad film but it also isn't great. The script and the acting are good but there are points that really bring the film down. It is an average film at best, made better by the talent on show. It does have some brilliantly quotable lines, and if you haven't seen this than you will notice which ones I am on about when you watch it. Despite being average I would suggest you watch it, mainly because it is an easy watch and one you won't particularly be disappointed with.3 \/ 5For more reviews www.tolli-movieworld.blogspot.com ","genre":null},{"date":"3 May 2012","score":"","review":" Jerry Maguire was released a good few years ago and, despite knowing a few of the quotes from the film, I had never seen it.

Here's the chance for movie-goers to witness his transformative skills in action. Marat\/Sade, which I'd seen previously on stage, is a Brechtian political drama about the French revolution performed in a madhouse under the direction of the notorious Marquis de Sade.

It was of all things the Clay Shaw, Tommy Lee Jones, trial that Stone used in his movie JFK to totally disprove the by now in the garbage can, in that almost no one believes it anymore, Warren Commission Report on the assassination. In that the Clay Shaw trial was the first and only trial that involved the JFK assassination with Shaw, a successful New Orleanes businessman,being charged with being, a planner not shooter, behind it.The movie succeeds in disproving the Warren Commission but falls somewhat flat on its face in trying to connect a number of US Government agencies, like the CIA, the Mafia anti-Castro Cubans as well as Vice President Johnson as being somehow behind JFK's assassination. It was like Stone trowing a plate of spaghetti on the wall and see what would stick. Still Stone does a masterful job in waking the public up to the discrepancies as well as out right lies that they've been fed over the years by major members of the US media that Lee Harvey Oswald, Gary Oldman, was the lone nut assassin or the assassin at all. It's three years after JFK was killed that New Orleans D.A Jim Garrison, Kevin Costner, decided to reopen the case in that Oswald originally was in the city, as a Marxist Communist activist, the summer before JFK was murdered. Oswald was also closely associated with a number of people who wanted President Kennedy dead and made no bone in hiding their dislike of him.As Garrison uncovers evidence that shows Oswlald was not what the media as well as the FBI and Warren Commission made him out to be key witnesses to what happened that fateful afternoon in Dallas Texas, November 22 1963, start to either clam up disappeared or meet an unexpected end in life. One of them is the wacko David Ferrie, Joe Pesci, who was in the same US civil air patrol unit with Oswald back in the mid 1950's when Oswald was still in his teens. Ferrie made an unexpected trip to Dallas to go duck hunting with a number of his friends the day that JFK was shot and left the very same evening! Was it to shoot JFK not ducks that Ferrie & Co were really interested in? It was through Ferrie as well as convicted male hooker Willie O'Keefe, Kevin Bacon, that eventually lead to Shaw in his being suspected of having foreknowledge to the JFK assassination.

It's then that all the BS half truths lies shyster talk and inconsistencies in what happened on November 22, 1963 becomes apparent to those of us watching the film as well as those in the courtroom. Even though Garrison doesn't end up convicting Clay Shaw in his part in the JFK assassination he does in fact prove that we've, the American public, had been had or conned into believing what the US Government and Warren Commission told us the truth about the facts in the JFK assassination without as much as bothering to check any of the facts or evidence out!

The film is based upon the novel by Mario Puzo (who co-wrote the screenplay) and many sub-plots were minimized or thrown away by director\/co-writer Francis Ford Coppola, himself an Italian American and family man. He knew that the only way to make Puzo's sprawling novel work on screen was to focus on the familial relationships within this crime story, whether it be father to son, brother to brother, or husband to wife. In this world blood is not only thicker than water, it is holy.Coppola opens the films with an interesting shot of a pitch black screen giving way to a desperate figure, an undertaker pleading to Mafioso patriarch Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) to revenge the savage beating of his daughter. It is the wedding day of the lone Corleone daughter Connie (Talia Shire), and no Sicilian can refuse a request, which Don Vito takes on with reason, while also subtlety enforcing his position as a man to be respected and feared.Brando's casting was a coup for Coppola, for three reasons. First, it exhibited the brilliance and innovation of Brando's thespian prowess, creating a wholly new mafia figure within a world of stereotype. Second, it re-established Brando's standing as a major player after years of being labeled box-office poison. And third, it points to Brando's influence as godfather to a generation of actors, many which play his children in this film.Plot wise, The Godfather begins with the attempted assassination of Don Vito from a rival crime family unhappy with his refusal to enter the narcotics trade. With the Don temporarily out of the picture, it is up to his sons to run the Corleone clan. There is hot tempered Sonny (James Caan), meek mild Fredo (John Cazale), adopted son of Irish ancestry Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), and the fiercely independent Michael (Al Pacino).It would be Michael who comes through as successor, and as a result The Godfather is as much Pacino's film as it is Brando's, introducing himself with a revelation of a performance.

It is the wedding day of the lone Corleone daughter Connie (Talia Shire), and no Sicilian can refuse a request, which Don Vito takes on with reason, while also subtlety enforcing his position as a man to be respected and feared.Brando's casting was a coup for Coppola, for three reasons. First, it exhibited the brilliance and innovation of Brando's thespian prowess, creating a wholly new mafia figure within a world of stereotype. Second, it re-established Brando's standing as a major player after years of being labeled box-office poison. And third, it points to Brando's influence as godfather to a generation of actors, many which play his children in this film.Plot wise, The Godfather begins with the attempted assassination of Don Vito from a rival crime family unhappy with his refusal to enter the narcotics trade. With the Don temporarily out of the picture, it is up to his sons to run the Corleone clan. There is hot tempered Sonny (James Caan), meek mild Fredo (John Cazale), adopted son of Irish ancestry Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), and the fiercely independent Michael (Al Pacino).It would be Michael who comes through as successor, and as a result The Godfather is as much Pacino's film as it is Brando's, introducing himself with a revelation of a performance.

The film is based upon the novel by Mario Puzo (who co-wrote the screenplay) and many sub-plots were minimized or thrown away by director\/co-writer Francis Ford Coppola, himself an Italian American and family man.

It makes the series incredibly differs and makes each movie feel new and fresh. It also totally isn't necessary to watch the previous two movies, before you watch this one. Every one of them can be watched independently from each other.But no, don't worry, I'm not completely crazy. Of course this is not a great movie by any means but it at least is fun and also very self aware. Thing with this movie and all of the previous ones as well, is that it knows that its bad. Especially also the actors seem to be very well aware of this. Because of this, the movie never gets awkward but simply enjoyable to watch instead.Now, the whole idea of the movie itself is quite stretched out however. The characters for the longest time are very busy with a whole bunch of stuff, expect for trying to find and kill the dinosaur. The movie too often really isn't going anywhere with its story, or any of its characters. Still, this doesn't make the movie annoying or anything. Just a tad bit ridicules but it strangely enough adds to the movie its entertainment value at the same time.The action and killings are being somewhat disappointing but then again, I wasn't expecting too much from it anyway. After all, the entire series isn't exactly known for its creativity and originality.It's watchable enough as a B-movie flick but it of course is far from being a great movie as well!4\/10 http\/\/bobafett1138.blogspot.com\/ ","genre":null},{"date":"3 May 2012","score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" The entire Carnosaurs-series often gets made fun of but in all truth and honesty, they are somewhat enjoyable for what they are and not all that bad at all, with the exception of the first movie.The thing that I particularly like about the series is that none of the movies are related and each movie is basically a new story, with different characters and settings.
