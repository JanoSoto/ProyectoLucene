With an acting performance we have rarely seen before and a plot that we would never expect, the film serves to be fun and it's exactly what it does, well kind of. I felt it was a safely kind of OK film but nowhere near being good, here is why I felt that way about it all.The story is absurd but fun and although I did feel it was a bit crazy it served to be entertaining for just over an Hour and a half. It isn't that funny is fair to say and the comedy part lacks, but hey even when it is trying to be humorous, it is still fun anyways. Finally on the plot, we already gathered it is crazy, but it has heart felt moments where you actually do feel for them slightly, the ending can take that away a bit but still show's us there brotherly love.Arnold Schwarzenegger actually does this role without killing people, he does it with his massive frame, big fists and short shorts? ,yes it sounds like he has gone mad but he actually does OK here and is one of the only emotional performances Arnie has ever done. Danny DeVito is fun as his twin and is also down on his luck a lot, he plays these parts the best in my opinion and obviously the way that one twin is massive, one twin is small makes for some fun and great circumstances.Ivan Reitman at the directing helm does a good job and for such a difficult comedy to do with such absurd circumstances, he does a fine job indeed. I felt the script is the weakest part of this movie with some horrible lines that just serve to annoy the viewer rather than make them laugh, whether or not the lines are delivered right by the actors is up to you but for me it is the screenplays fault. I actually enjoyed the cinematography which although is typically 80's in it's shots, works really well and most street scenes and car scenes are done beautifully well.As I said before, the film isn't so funny and if you want big laughs then this isn't for you, it tries it's hardest at times as well but misses the overall mark of the film. I also did feel that although I said the acting was OK and Arnie's best, it still isn't that great, and even for a comedy which can sometimes escape with bad acting, the acting here is kind of emotionless and stale, AT TIMES. One more thing is the crazy idea all together which doesn't work THAT well but ah well, just have fun with it.People who enjoy good and fun movies with a little heartfelt emotion intertwined within should like this as well as those who like a movie where the actors just look like they had fun making it. Arnie fans may be left disappointed if they are expecting violence and armed gangs, he does used violence about once or twice in this but he is no Commando by any means in this film.Overall I'll give it a 6\/10 because I did feel it was safely an OK- ish movie, albeit it is nowhere near being good let alone just OK but it still is entertainment and these two actors together on screen at there best and funniest. I would also say to watch it as rumours of a sequel are flying around now and again so just sit back back and enjoy the ride, even if it is a little bumpy.

","genre":"Comedy, Crime"},{"date":"5 April 2014","score":"","review":" Are you boys gonna chase down your leads or are you gonna sit drinkin' coffee in the one house in the state where I know my boy ain't at?Raising Arizona, the Coen brothers' sophomore film, is an eccentric screwball comedy that feels cartoonish at times but served as an exercise in form for their upcoming comedies. This perhaps is much lighter in tone and more humane, but some of their common trademarks can be found in this early film of theirs. I don't think it's as cynical as most of their other work, but it does have a similar quirky sense of humor that can be found in all their comedies. Besides being original, it also happens to be very entertaining introducing some wacky and memorable characters. If you are fan of the Coen's work you will see a lot of familiar faces (John Goodman and Frances McDermond in supporting roles), but it was the lead roles from Nicolas Cage and Holly Hunter that truly surprised me. They were great together playing this unconventional family that will be really hard to forget. Hi is one of Nicolas Cage's most memorable characters and his crazy hair was the highlight of his performance. As in most of their films, the stereotypes are captured really well and this time it was the Southwest's turn to play for laughs with their thick accents. The performances in this film were all highly exaggerated giving the film its cartoonish tone. Raising Arizona was a joyful experience despite the fact that I didn't find myself laughing too hard; it's a good film, but not as good as The Big Lebowski. Despite their familiar trademarks, the Coens show so much range in their films going from neo-noir to slapstick comedies. They are a force to reckon with. H.I. McDunnough (Nicolas Cage) meets his future wife, Ed (Holly Hunter), in the most uncommon of situations. She is a police officer in Arizona, and he is a criminal who keeps on getting caught for robbing convenience stores. Since he never carries a loaded weapon his stints in prison are short, but he manages to turn his life around once he falls for Ed. They enjoy their first years of marriage and are truly happy together, so much so that Ed convinces Hi to start a family because their blissfulness should be shared. The only problem is that they are unable to conceive a baby and due to Hi's criminal past they can't adopt either. The only solution is to kidnap one so they find their perfect victim one of the quintuplets of a furniture tycoon, Nathan Arizona (Trey Wilson). They don't think it's fair that the Arizona's got five children, so they convince themselves that they have more they can handle anyway. This event changes their lives forever as friends from Hi's past show up (John Goodman and William Forsythe), as well as his coworkers (Sam McMurray and Frances McDormand), and an evil apocalyptic bounty hunter (Randall Tex Cobb) who haunts his dreams. This baby has changed their lives forever.The wacky and over the top performances in this film worked really well thanks to some skillful writing from the Coens and some clever one liners. I already mentioned how good the lead performances were, but some of the supporting turns were also quite impressive, the standouts being Frances McDormand and Randall Tex Cobb. Cobb's character reminded me a lot of a cartoonish version of Javier Bardem's turn in No Country for Old Men. There are also some very funny scenes revolving around Trey Wilson and once again the Coens make the victim look really unsympathetic, allowing the audience to root for the wacky outlaws. It's a charming film with some great scenes, one involving a long crazy chase across an Arizona neighborhood. It is a very sharp and clever comedy that also happens to be very entertaining taking us through an adventure that only the Coens could come up with.

Jackie, sammo, and yuen baio don't count, because they studied peking opera dance and acrobatics. my favorite out of all of them is Bruce lee. mark my words, just like there will never be another James Dean, there will never be another Bruce lee. the mans a legend and he had a total of four completed films, the last one in 1973, after that there were countless imitations. so if you are a true fan of Bruce lee, his last completed film was enter the dragon in 1973. he was about to take the world by storm right before his death.OK, on to the movie...the setting is pre-world war 2 shanghai China, and it is about his masters poisoning death by the hands of the Japanese, while Bruce was away. he comes back for the funeral and is immediately suspicious unlike his other classmates.the investigation goes deeper, he finds out people from his school were directly involved with the death and the bodies start piling-up from there on. the pacing got a little bit slow during the middle but thats okay, it wasn't just a kung-fu movie, there was serious acting in it too. it is just the awesome imagery Bruce lee conveys when he is doing his thing...it is like on a visceral level impossible to duplicate. i love kung-fu movies in general but i have to say, there is no one like Bruce Lee...his style was his own and everybody tried to imitate him and everybody failed miserably or it was just meant to be comical. forget about other kung-fu movie stars trying to imitate him..., ever since i can remember(early 1980's)of my childhood in NYC, i would see him on TV, i walk down the street and guys are imitating him, i see t-shirts of him and this is in the United States...i can imagine how crazy it must have been in Hong Kong.when Bruce lee did his moves they look so real and he was incredibly quick, like a cat and the closest i've seen in speed is jet li. watching Bruce lee beat up bad-guys is like a guilty pleasure that you don't mind. there is so many classic images from this movie and they are like burned into my mind and i will never forget those images...the initial dojo fight, the ending where the shot ends on a freeze frame and like a hundred other shots in the movie. this movie is bleaker then his other three films, but it was shot beautifully, more so then the other 3 films.thank you for your 4 completed films and may your legend and myth live on forever!

The best drug in the world. God has passed through you. Why deny it, that for a moment there, God was you?Bringing Out the Dead presents a dark and bleak view of New York City as we get to experience it through the main character's depressive perception. Working as an ambulance paramedic, Frank Pierce has always found purpose in his life in saving others, but after not being able to save a young girl and feeling haunted by her ghost he has lost his passion and begins to question his existence. The torment he is experiencing leads him to an identity crisis that impacts the way he (and therefore we the audience) sees the city. Martin Scorsese gets all the technical aspects of the film right, teaming up with his usual collaborators the cinematography done by Robert Richardson and the editing by Thelma Schoonmaker, but somehow the story doesn't work as well. I understand what he was trying to do, but I just couldn't care for the characters in this film and it all felt a little too surreal for my taste. This is the first film from Scorsese that I've seen that hasn't worked for me, but I do have to give him credit for delivering on the technical aspects. There are also some great moments and some supporting performances that worked really well for me, but it only made me wish the film focused on those characters instead of on Frank. The unique way in which the city was portrayed through Frank's eyes as he's dealing with his personal demons and nightmares really never engaged me because I didn't care for his character. His partners on the other hand were much more engaging and I wish we could've seen it through their eyes instead. The screenplay was adapted by Paul Schrader from Joe Connelly's novel of the same name. This was Schrader and Scorsese's fourth and final collaboration together after having worked in Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, and The Last Temptation of Christ. Bringing Out the Dead is perhaps most similar to Taxi Driver in tone, but it is a departure from most of his work considering its surreal and nightmarish tone. The film follows Frank Pierce (Nicolas Cage) as he drives across New York City in his ambulance during the night shifts. It's a two man ambulance team although his partners switch every night. Frank is completely burned out considering he hasn't been able to save anyone over the past few weeks and is eagerly awaiting to be fired. His partners don't seem to be experiencing the same problem as they all seem to deal with their demons in different ways. There's Larry (John Goodman) who is constantly thinking about food, Marcus (Ving Rhames) who is a religiously devoted man, and Tom (Tom Sizemore) who borderlines on psychotic behavior. They work for Mercy Hospital, which is always full of wacky characters and very crowded. Frank begins to fraternize with the daughter of one of the patients he brings in, her name is Mary (Patricia Arquette), and she seems to be the only good thing about his job now. Tormented by the ghosts of those he couldn't save, he searches for his salvation through trying to help Mary and saving both of them in the process. Despite not enjoying this film as much as I have other Scorsese movies, I have to admit that there were some incredibly entertaining scenes. Ving Rhames has an amazing scene along Nicolas Cage and one of the patients they are trying to save. It was hilarious. He was by far my favorite character in the film. Patricia Arquette was also pretty interesting, and Cliff Curtis also had a couple of great scenes as Cy. Those were the highlights for me in an exhilarating and fast paced film that failed to engage me with the main character played by Cage. Scorsese does manage to capture the chaos and darkness of the city in a very unique way and the technical brilliance of this film stand out above the story. It's a demented film, but it just wasn't my type of movie because the story was emotionally uninvolving. I will give it credit for the hilarious scenes, but I was let down by the lack of an engaging story.

Two of the most famous monsters of all time duking it out, and this was new in people's minds when they made it. So what's the history?HISTORY - Well in the late 50s, Willis O'Brian was going through some troubles in his career, having many ideas that he wanted to put on screen thrown out by studios. Looking for a way to bump his career up again, he went back to the giant ape that got him fame and decided to fill a few ideas to bring Kong back to the screen. Though remaking the film entered his mind, the idea of Kong fighting another famous monster was to him a better approach since the 1940s had made big bucks off Universal Monsters teaming up in fighting each other with Frankenstein Meets The Wolfman, and House Of Dracula. Being a fan of the Frankenstein Monster in novel and film, he began to write a script for King Kong VS Frankenstein. Meanwhile in Japan, Toho Studios had just made their first big successful monster film that began the Kaiju genre. Enter Godzilla or Gojira, a film that showcased a man in a dinosaur suit stomping Tokyo as a symbol of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima. The film was a successful hit in Japan, America and around the world in 1954. So much that Toho made a sequel called Godzilla Raids Again where he battles another monster Angirus. Toho would later make other Kaiju films such as Rodan and Mothra in the late 50's. Losing a bit of steam after a few films, producer, Tomoyuki Tanaka decided to bring Godzilla back in a widescreen color feature. The question was who would be his competitor?Being fans and insipid to make Godzilla because of the original King Kong, Toho thought that the idea of bringing the two monsters together would make big money not just in Japan and America, but around the world. So they went to RKO personally to pitch the idea. RKO agreed, but did not tell O'Brien. Wow, dick move guys! Shortly after the deal, Marian C. Cooper heard the news and was rightfully angry about it since he created the character. What followed was one of the many battles over the course of 6 and half decades over the rights of King Kong. In this round, Cooper lost.CHARACTERS - The movie is a Kaiju film, meaning that the monsters come before characters. But I will try to talk about non monster characters the best I can, even though there bland and very forgettable. First there's Mr. Tako, who is the most memorable of the cast. Playing a Denham like role, his character is more comedic than brave, always acting hyper and on some sort of drug that makes him twitch. The two guys hired by Tako to explore the island are bland, boring and uninteresting. The only scene that I gave a crap about them is when they confront Tako on the ship porting Kong to Tokyo. Fujita is bland. Fumiko is only there for Kong to have a love interest. The Army General is there to be the 2 dimensional general guy and the natives, um, they're Japanese extras painted to look African. Kind of racist there Toho. VISUAL EFFECTS - With this being a Godzilla movie, all the effects were done with men in monster suits and model sets. Allot of scenes from the movie are memorable like Kong's encounters with Godzilla and a giant Octopus. And although Godzilla looks great and the rest of the effects and sets are standard issue, Kong looks terrible. The suit has a visible zipper and the arms are long and skinny, not at all like a real gorilla. The masks look like a combination of a 5 year old clay sculpting of Kong 33's long face made tiny compared to the body and puppet on strings facial features. They also dumbed down Kong's character, making him a tad stupid. TRIVIA - Now as allot of people have covered that there was an alternate ending were Godzilla won the battle, I have two theories about this rumor. 1st this rumor started in a series of children's book by Crestwood, explained in the Kong edition. 2nd, if Godzilla did win, I don't think the ending would have been so victorious.

He may have picture-perfect hair, but he sure ain't no Romeo.And meet Elizabeth McGraw, the ceaselessly pouting ho from Soho. She may have sexy, flyaway hair, but she sure ain't no Juliet.And, with that - He says Hi! She says Bye. He says Yes. She says No. He sends flowers. She's so delighted.She's a nosey-parker. He likes to spanky-spanky. He grunts. She groans. He smirks. She squeals.He pours on the honey. She farts in ecstasy. He cracks the whip. She picks up the money. He says Obey! She says OK. He says Where? She says Here. He says Mine. She says Yours. He smirks. She cries. He says Good day! She says Good-Bye! Tsk. Tsk. Tsk. And, with that, the Soho ho and the Wall Street prick live crappily ever after. Apart.Yep. There certainly goes 9 1\/2 weeks of some of the dreariest sexual-obsession, soap opera that I've seen in a mighty long time.And speaking about creating a real cozy and chummy atmosphere - It totally killed me that Elizabeth's best friend and fellow co-worker, Molly, was secretly screwing around with Liz's ex-husband, Bruce, all along. (But, then, like a real trooper, she finally fesses-up to the treachery) Well, hey, what the hell are good friends for? If you can believe it - Back in 1986 this laughable, $17 million production, whose story was clearly 80% style over substance, was taken so seriously by its sexually-obsessed audience that it actually made back 6 times its initial costs at the box-office in no time flat.On a side-note - I think it's really scary to see just how drastically Mickey Rourke's looks have deteriorated over the last 26 years.

Joining drugs, explicit scenes, and gory crimes. Directed by Brian De Palma, the movie Scar Face (1983), talks about the 1980s period in Miami, Tony Montana (Al Pacino), a Cuban immigrant takes over a drug cartel while succumbing to greed. The movie got nominated for 6 awards including Best Performance by an actor in a motion picture for Al Pacino and and best classic DVD release. The initial critical response to Scarface was mixed, with criticism over excessive violence, frequent strong language and graphic hard drug usage. Some Cuban expatriates in Miami objected to the film's portrayal of Cubans as criminals and drug traffickers. Contemporary reviews have been more positive, and screenwriters and directors have notably praised the movie. It is now considered a classic within the mob film genre and has resulted in many cultural references such as in comic books and video games. In my opinion Scarface really is a good movie to watch, its mature and gory scenes make it look like real events and that the movie was well developed. i recommend watching such movie.

Additionally, it is a movie that has been done better before, think Silence of the Lambs or the influx of sci fi movies that came out around the same time including (but not limited to); Dark City (1998), The Matrix (1999), The Thirteenth Floor (1999).Although the movie has a relatively short runtime of 1 hour 30minutes it spends too long trying to build suspense and tension. The latest victim of a serial killer, is trapped with only 40 hours to live, unless the FBI find her before she drowns. Building suspense and tension meant it wasn't until half way through the movie where the movie's main 'attraction' or selling point happened with Catherine Deane (Jennifer Lopez) entering the mind of Carl Stargher (Vincent D'Onofrio) who at times appears to channel Norman Bates (quiet, weird, loner type).The films strongest aspect is the wildly vivid imagery and thankfully it still stands up 14 years later. It is clear while watching inside Stargher's mind scenes, that director Tarsem Singh, has taken heavy inspiration from works of art by the likes of; Hirst, Nedrum and Giger. It's as if the director needed an excuse for the plot to show such uniquely disturbing images, that varied in styles including the recurring theme of water, and misogyny which normally in a movie wouldn't blend together. The director came up with the idea of going into the mind of a disturbed schizophrenic, using some kind of newly created experimental technology, which then made it possible to incorporate his eerie dream like sequences. Never once was it explained what this experimental technology was, how it worked, or any detail about the device, the machine was also rather reminiscent of the virtual world used in The Matrix released the previous year and worked in a relatively similar fashion.Other than the vivid imagery, the movies only other saving grace is Vincent D'Onofrio, who excels at what little he has been given to work with. Vincent D'Onofrio is the standout of an otherwise mediocre cast, a cast many people may be scratching their head over. The leads are a singer (Lopez) and a comedian (Vaughn). Having a poor cast is one thing then to go and have no character depth, weak script\/writing and clichéd lines these hamper the film even further.The only reason anyone should watch The Cell is for the creative visuals, costumes, set pieces displayed and Vincent D'Onofrio's strong acting, which shows how truly underrated he is as an actor. This has people questioning why he doesn't get much work.Those looking for a good sci fi, horror, thriller should look elsewhere, as this story is forgetful, with no surprises or twists. Its predictable and has a clichéd Hollywood style ending.Further viewing; Silence of the Lambs, Dark City, The Matrix, The Thirteenth Floor.
