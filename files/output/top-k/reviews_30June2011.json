However, I actually initially thought it was going to be about the slave trade, but that is a minor trifle in my train of thought as what I got was actually better.The movie opens with a beautiful orchid setting up the movie, showing you the innocence of two girls frolicking around the field (it's a rather moving moment but you know it's not going to be quite that similar throughout). Then she gives birth in 1909 to a baby, who she is deprived of from her Father, as the movie chronicles her struggle at education and how this all unfolds. The movie deviates slightly from the book, with Spielberg's need for audience warmth I suppose, but he does do very well with the plotting. Even with the scenes intercutting with the reading of those letters from her sister Nettie...Danny Glover plays Albert, a character raised simply to be harmful, callous and overbearing to his wife in the most domineering of fashions possible. He would sort of a generic in that antagonistic sense; but as a character he plays it very well (he was out of Lethal Weapon, which made it feel weird to see him in this movie). He's a farmer and he adjures his servant wife (Goldberg's character, Celie) to do things for him, shave him also. However, through these experiences she learns the panache and forthrightness to speak up for herself.My only problems with it would be that I thought the way it established Goldberg as a comedic figure was sort of out of character; when she loses the urge to smile, we lose the urge to smile, as if it's infectious. When she didn't go with her sister, I sort of wondered why not... I guess her mind was running through a totally haphazardly sense of reasoning, but still it does hit you emotionally. The real thing this movie does rely on sometimes emotion and also the conquer through this oppression; oppression is really problematic and throughout you really are in a state of oppression, wanting to be liberated just like Goldberg (In the sense you identify with her).I was recommended to see this movie, so I finally bought it and I must say I definitely recommend it as well; the relationships are not complex, but they're deep and profound. The evolution of Celie's character get you really grounded in involvement throughout. Also Oprey Winfrey as Sophie is a great character to use as the analogy for Celie; however, she's not a really necessary character, but she is a character that can get through to Celie. ... I can say that I will one day watch this movie over again. It does leave you with a mellow feeling, and a real sense of freedom in such tumultuous times. It however will not leave you with the same emotions as his subsequent Schindler's List film does, and in fact, Spielberg's trademark barely feels pervasive in the movie... still he utilizes fluid and swimmingly posed shots that are set to really make you look galore at a wonderful experience; it is not a true story, so there will be no qualms for anybody with any proclamation that this is so.

Travolta's character Frank Morrison's marriage to angular beauty Teri Polo has ended, and their 12-year-old son is now living with her and nice guy Rick (Vince Vaughn), who isn't actually as nice as he appears to be. At one point, as things are going particularly badly with his son, we see Frank downing shots in a bar at double-quick time. All of a sudden he's joined, without introduction, by a middle-aged lady who may or may not be the sister of Clarence from It's a Wonderful Life, but is more likely to be Frank's AA sponsor. He's a drunk, you see, and that's why his marriage ended. The trouble is, nobody involved in the film felt this was important enough to explain until this moment, about midway through the film. And after a brief, largely inconsequential conversation Clarence's sister disappears, never to be seen or referred to again.Vince Vaughn is the best thing about this entertaining if strictly ordinary little thriller. He switches effortlessly from the image of good-looking, laid-back American male perfection &#x96; or Hollywood's perception of it, anyway &#x96; to darkly menacing bad guy, looming over the hapless Jason (James Lashley) who finds himself in something of a quandary after eavesdropping on his step-dad cold-bloodedly murdering a former partner in crime who threatened to blow over the perfect house of cards he had so painstakingly constructed for himself. When Jason blows the whistle, nobody believes him &#x96; apart from his dad &#x96; and it looks as if it's only a matter of time before he and Pop meet with 'accidents' that will get them out of Rick's hair forever.Although Domestic Disturbance is entertaining enough, there are too many incidents like the one mentioned above to make it a film worth watching. For example, I can't remember any film in which a person accused of murder is allowed to sit in on the police interview with the person making that accusation &#x96; especially when it's a 12-year-old kid. Things like that are just examples of sloppy writing, of incidents in which the writer has forsaken reality in an attempt to crank up the tension. Likewise with the lighter that once belonged to Rick's murder victim, and the speed with which Rick catches on to what Frank's been up to. The film also loses focus at times as it neglects Frank or Jason's side of the story in order to concentrate on the other's side; it's an impossible story to tell from just one point of view, but they could have found a more seamless way of splitting the perspective between father and son.

Harris gives Hoyt one simple task; accompany him on a one-day ride-along where he must prove himself worthy of enlistment. Now from this point on the movie maintains a steady level of immense entertainment. The most noteworthy aspect of this movie is Denzel Washington's awesome, and Academy-Award Winning portrayal of Alonzo Harris; the rugged cop that has seemingly blurred the line between what is right and what isn't. His performance is as charismatic and imposing, as it is chilling and antagonizing. Every line that Washington delivered was either intensely funny or incredibly demented (but still funny). Which brings me to the script; The Fast And The Furious writer, David Ayer, delivers deeply provocative dialogue, as well as a compelling narrative that delves into some very insightful themes. The main theme of the movie, however, seems to be a blend of the Crime doesn't pay and Power corrupts. So, in a sense, this story not only provides an incredibly accurate depiction of Inner-city LA, and exceedingly tense performances from its actors, but it may also serve as a cautionary tale - a cautionary tale that would not have been told sans the tremendous direction from Antoine Fuqua. Fuqua really did an impeccable job at delivering methodical, and aesthetic visuals. Fuqua also used his personal connections to access parts of LA that most people has never seen, in a sense, giving these parts of LA a voice.

Fellini's camera glides through the scenes. As do the actors, in a clearly choreographed ballet of acting.Guido (Fellini alter-ego Marcello Mastroianni), is a film maker hot off the success of a film, and under pressure to direct another. As Guido keeps producers, writers, actors hanging for any slither of information of what the film is about. He secretly internalises his thoughts that segue from fantasy to memories of his past. Guido wants to make a film that tells no lies. He is himself, a selfish, and unfaithful character. He can not externalise his thoughts to direct the film that he wants to. His fantasies and memories culminate in his power of a hareem of women all of these women from his life past and present who are all faithful, loyal, and love him. Guido seems, within his fantasy, to be destroying his own ability to speak the truth, as he is told by the women.But one, elusive woman; his fantasy woman (Claudia Cardinale), seems to be the person (muse if you like), that will make the film happen. But she proves to be unattainable. This truly is the greatest film about film making, as is so commonly stated. Guido's memories\/fantasies are built within him to breakdown, and destroy his own creativity. This level of self-degradating of a block in creativity portrayed to perfection, both in dazzling cinematography and Mastroianni's laconic portrayal of an artist questioning his ability to create. Whilst this subject informed the creation of 8 1\/2, it certainly does not display any inability in Fellini's startlingly beautiful, well crafted film; and quite often as stylistically creative as Citizen Kane (1941).

Can't really go wrong with that combination of talents, can you? Apparently you can. The star director fails to make great use of his two star performers. Hitchcock is the master of suspense. But with Suspicion he produced a film in which suspense, and drama, is sorely lacking. The film really doesn't work on any level. It's disappointing throughout and the terrible ending is a final insult. Direct enough movies you're going to have a few duds. This is a Hitchcock dud.Grant plays playboy Johnny Aysgarth who arrives in town and sweeps dowdy Lina McLaidlaw, played by Fontaine, off her feet. Well, there's your first problem. The dowdy Joan Fontaine? I'm sorry but no matter how many times Johnny calls Lina by the nickname he gives her, and it seems he does so about a thousand times to greatly annoying effect, Joan Fontaine's no Monkeyface. We're meant to believe that Lina is an unattractive, undesirable woman, destined to be an old maid until Johnny rescues her. Even her own parents are convinced no man would ever want her. So when Johnny shows an interest Lina rushes headlong into marriage. And immediately finds that Johnny is not at all who she thought him to be. He gave off the impression he was quite wealthy but the guy's flat broke. And he has no interest in rectifying that situation by getting a job. Johnny's a lazy, irresponsible cad. It doesn't take long for Lina to start to believe Johnny is much more interested in her father's money than he is in her. But Lina will have bigger problems down the road. As Johnny's financial situation worsens Lina begins to suspect he is capable of quite monstrous things. Murderous things. And she's the obvious victim-to-be.Grant certainly has no problem playing the charming playboy. As a possible cold-blooded killer he is much less convincing. Is he really a murderer? The film keeps you guessing all the way through. Or tries to anyway. There's just not all that much dramatic tension, odd in a movie about a woman who thinks her husband is out to kill her. The story never really grabs hold of you. The best Hitchcock films put you on the edge of your seat. This film never has that effect. For this movie to work we have to be right in Lina's head, to see what she sees, feel what she feels. The movie is all about her suspicions. As good as Fontaine is in the role, and she probably is the best thing the film has to offer, the character of Lina never works completely. There's just something that's off about the character, about the whole film in truth. The pieces of this puzzle never all seem to fit together properly. Fontaine would win an Oscar for her portrayal of the dowdy woman whom a charming man wants to marry for her father's money. Eight years later Fontaine's sister, Olivia de Havilland, would win an Oscar for her portrayal of a dowdy woman whom a charming man wants to marry for her father's money in The Heiress. There the similarities end. The Heiress is a much better film than this one. Suspicion disappoints throughout and then comes the ending which is the worst thing of all. The movie fizzles out with a meek, lamentable whimper. For once Hitchcock really missed the mark.

Many people would shoot me (Or decapitate me - excuse the pun) for making such a statement. His films are just so original and unique and Burton seems to have a distinctive talent for creating eerie Gothic and dream-like sets. I'm ashamed to say that I have not yet seen The Nightmare Before Christmas, often hailed as being his gem of the crown jewels, but I have seen many of his other films, including Charlie and the Chocolate Factory which I thought was better than the original, and the tragic Edward Scissorhands and the flamboyant and bloody musical Sweeney Todd The Demon Barber of Fleet Street. But this film here I think is his finest hour Sleepy Hollow starring a fine assembled cast that includes Johnny Depp (Which goes without saying), Christina Ricci, Miranda Richardson, Michael Gambon, Casper Van Dien, Jeffrey Jones, Ian McDiarmid, Claire Skinner and Christopher Walken - with the iconic Christopher Lee making a cameo in one scene.1799, and Constable Icabod Crane (Depp) is finding his efforts to rationalise the court system in New York City proving to be in vain. His superiors are getting sick of listening to him and at a court sitting where Crane talks out against them again, they decide to send him and his methods to the small town of Sleepy Hollow for a murder investigation - a three day journey from New York City. They send him off only telling him the basics of what he needs to know - three people have been murdered there in a fortnight, each one with their head cut off. Crane arrives at the grim town and immediately meets the acquaintance of the beautiful Katrina Van Tassel (Christina Ricci), the daughter of Baltus who is the mayor of Sleepy Hollow. After announcing his arrival, Crane is summoned by Baltus to meet the heads of the town - the Reverand, the Magistrate, the Notary and Baltus himself. It's here that Crane is told about the headless horseman, and how he is back from the grave seeking heads to take back to the fires of hell with him. Crane sees this as utter nonsense, telling the men 'the murderer is of flesh and blood and I will find him'. He's given all the help he requires, and soon Crane realises that everything he believed in, and all the assumptions he had made about Sleepy Hollow, weren't true. And his stay in the town begins to unlock some forgotten memories from a past he thought he had forever lost...Based on a short story by Washington Irving, I can't say if Burton does justice to it or not for I haven't read it. But since it's a short story of something like fifteen pages long, needless to say a lot more would have to be added into the film. The romance between Crane and Katrina is handled very well and Depp and Ricci make it very realistic and believable, and it never takes away from the eerie and oppressive atmosphere. Danny Elfman provides an outstanding score that really makes the film I think, especially when put together with the intoxicating cinematography and the skillful directing of Tim Burton. The acting is brilliant all around - I think Christopher Walken's manic performance as the Hessian Horseman was very memorable, and the script was very well written, throwing in some very witty dialog. As horror goes, it's quite intense at times, and the gore is pretty plentiful and the decapitations are done very well. Overall, it's a different kind of film from Burton, using sets and dark, bleak imagery that he wouldn't use quite as immensely as so again until Sweeney Todd... in 2007.While it's a horror movie - with some very heavy elements of fantasy thrown in as well, Sleepy Hollow can also be taken as a crime film as well with scenes and elements reminiscent of your average Agatha Christie crime stories - with a Gothic twist. Burton and Depp prove once again to be an excellent director\/actor pairing - just like Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro. I've seen it a good few times now but it's still as fresh as ever every time I watch it. First time viewing, it's very interesting as the plot and conspiracy begin to unfold as Crane tries to win the heart of Katrina, and also - not to be cheesy - but keep his head on at the same time while he battles the past and the present.

So challenging I hesitate between two radical attitudes, introspective and philosophical or cynical and detached, but I guess neither would work. One would be like Lester's infamous highlight of the day, the other like Lester unbuttoning Angela's blouse with appetite before she reveals it's her first time. In both cases, it's excitement leading to disappointment. So, what's American Beauty exactly telling us?In fact, I don't even think the movie tells 'us' something, but rather tells something different 'for each of us' ... for some people, it's like an Existentialism For Dummies film, for others, it's an inspirational invitation to play an active role in life rather than enduring it. The figure of Kevin Spacey as Lester Burnham, the average looking tertiary employee man, incarnates the pervert effects of suburban life, mostly made of superficiality and illusions of happiness through the sensations of owning stuff, or being someone on the basis that you wears a tie, carry a briefcase and have a job, no matter how useless for the future of humanity, it is. But Lester incarnates this figure with the quality that makes losers so appealing lucidity. He knows his life is crap. He knows his wife Carolyn (Annette Bening) and his tormented 17-year old daughter Jane (Thora Birch) see him as a loser. And he knows his life has reached rock-bottom, but it's never too late to change. Paraphrasing another existential film of the same year, we meet Lester at a very strange time in his life, where in a crucial Howard 'Bealesque' impulse, he decides he can't take it anymore.And the pivotal point couldn't have been creepier. Lester gets infatuated with his daughter's friend, the cute and apparently slutty Angela, and decides to do some muscular exercises, to impress her and ultimately to &#x85; sort of &#x85; bang her. Well, the beautiful Conrad L. Hall's cinematography depicts Lester's lusty fantasies in such stylish aesthetics you totally forget that it's all about assessing his manhood on a creature so young, she would see the man, not the exploited office worker, the passive husband, or the lousy father. Angela, the delicate and sensual Mena Suvari shows the light to Lester, a road paved with so many rose petals that paint Lester's dreams in a shining red almost foreseeing the film's bloody epilogue. Anyway, from this lust at first sight moment, Lester is another man, abandoning himself to solitary pleasures not in the shower anymore, but in bed with Carolyn, who starts to realize that if she's not the mother of the year, she's not the wife either.Carolyn is a flamboyant real estate agent who loves her job, as much as her little rose garden. She takes care of both with the same perfectionist delicacy and same dreams of accomplishment. She's so blinded by her ambition that she's incapable to realize the failure of her marriage and lives more confidently in the apparent illusion of comfort and success, than the real substantial essence of happiness. But Carolyn is only superficial if you look at her with superficial eyes. Look closer, since this is the movie's tag-line, Carolyn is not ambitious, she's not superficial, she's just naive for God's sake. She's the perfect embodiment of the constant optimistic attitude illustrated by Voltaire's character Candide whose motto -ironically- happened to be  We need to cultivate our garden. And for the disillusioned Jane, the idea of self-improvement can only be reduced to a project of breasts augmentation surgery. Her teenage crisis is aggravated by the absence of strong models. She hates her pervert father, her dull mother, her life. The changes occurring in the Burnham Family will coincide with the arrival of the new neighbors, the Fits, another peculiar and not-so-happy family. The father Frank, Chris Cooper, is a bigot minded homophobic ex-military officer, with a totally lobotomized wife and one unique son, Wes Bentley as the tortured Ricky. Ricky is literally, the 'eye' of the film, as the one who films people with a cam and develops a strange ability to see inner beauty whether it's in Jane, dead birds or plastic bags, yes he's weird. Me Ricky, You Jane. He's not just an eye-opener, he's eye-opening, catalyzing Lester's evolution, leading to one of the most inspiring 'I quit' scenes from a man who's got 'nothing to lose'. But in a pessimistic device, paraphrasing another existential film of the same year, self-improvement ends up looking like masturbation and for Lester, the death it lead to, wasn't the little one. He'll end up killed by Frank Fits after the unfortunate misunderstanding built up all through the film. Ebert said something like Lester Burnham is dead but he's not a loser anymore. I disagree with this positivist attitude. Death is still the ultimate loss and I'd rather not be a loser, only if I had the chance to be something else.So for realistic people, American Beauty is a pessimistic pamphlet against the American Way of Life. For pessimistic people, it's a depressing introspection into the alienating effect of the bourgeois way of life, for depressed people, it's the unbearable crappyness of life ... so crappy that you rather find beauty in a vulgar plastic bag floating in the wind ... Or maybe everything is not what it seems to be, and American Beauty is just a manipulative film trying to convey the dangerous idea that the best way to be freed from social obligations is to do sports, smoke pot, and live like a parasite, or it's simply the best film of the 90's.

What everyone thought would be a flop is the reason we have the likes of Pinocchio (1940), Beauty and the Beast (1991), Aladdin (1992), The Lion King (1994), Toy Story (1995) and Tangled (2011). This film blew away audiences back then, being hailed as one of the greatest cinematic achievements and even being proclaimed the greatest film of all time by Russian director Sergei M. Eisenstein. The amazing thing is, Snow White blew people away when it was re-released in 2001 in the Platinum Edition, reminding people that the older Disney movies are timeless, and will never be topped.Adapted from the Grimm Fairytale and made family-friendly, Snow White follows the story of...Snow White (Adriana Caselotti), who is proclaimed the fairest of them all, much to the distaste of her stepmother, The Queen (Lucille La Verne). A hunter is hired to take Snow White out into the woods and kill her, returning her heart to The Queen as proof, but having a change of heart, lets Snow White escape. She stumbles across an old house in the woods, which houses seven dwarfs.The re-master is gorgeous, highlighting just how beautiful the animation is, and why hand-drawn will always be the best. The animals are cute as ever, the evil woods scene looks stunning, The Queen's transformation still frightening, and the final scene in the storm is just as epic as it was when I was five! I forgot just how many fantastic musical numbers this movie had, with Whistle While you Work, Heigh Ho and Someday My Prince Will Come sounding as good as ever.This film spawned some of the greatest family films of all time, with Pinocchio, Bambi, Dumbo and Fantasia following straight after Snow White's success. As a 20 year old guy, I thought the magic may have worn off, but this film is a lasting legacy, a testament to the brilliance of these old Disney films. Watching this again, I found myself smiling at the antics of the dwarfs, singing to songs I'd long forgotten, and crying with the dwarfs over Snow White's body.

Especially when it's been so lovingly cared-for as Warren Beatty's Dick Tracy, a mega-blockbuster from the dawn of the 1990s. But alas, I tragically have to. For despite all that it has going for it, despite all that it got right (and it got a lot right), the movie ultimately tries to cram so much into so little and came off, for me anyway, as a little empty. It just didn't wow me as its marvelous art direction made me want it to.Mr. Beatty's fear that no sequel would be made to his film ultimately came true, and because of his prediction he shoved well over twenty characters from the long-running Charles Gould comic strip series into a 105-minute window. So many characters for so simplistic a plot. Director\/producer Mr. Beatty also plays the square-jawed detective bent on catching his arch-nemesis in the act. His fiend is the united mob's leader, Big Boy Caprice (Al Pacino), a cantankerous, self-delusional patriarch with an endless array of punch lines. Whenever he's not attempting to pin a charge on the mobster, Tracy is tending to a runaway orphan (Charlie Korsmo) and attempting to maintain his relationships between two women. One a quiet little botanist (Glenne Headly) the other a sexy nightclub singer (Madonna).Amidst them are countless other peculiar individuals, many of them portrayed by famous stars clad in heavy make-up. But there we have the first of the movie's problems. There are more than twenty characters from the comic strip, all crammed in there so tautly, and yet so desperately for screen attention, that few of them ultimately leave any kind of a mark. Even though R.G. Armstrong and William Forsythe are extremely good in the movie, the only thing really distinguishing is the level of cosmetics applied to their faces. There are so many villains and so many of them demand attention and yet the only one who really stands out is Mr. Pacino, who gives one of the most happily hyperbolic and energetic performances of his career as Big Boy Caprice.Another problem the movie has is an ambition to show and contain so much within so short a window. As a result, many sequences skimp over without leaving any kind of a mark. The denouement, though unexpected by me, came off as kind of flat because of the narrow writing and overly-taut editing. And frankly, even though Mr. Beatty does a great job playing the straight-face detective most of the time, his dynamics with the two central women in the plot are flimsy and not so interesting. Now in a comic strip, one can get away with a narrow narrative and characterizations, because all of that is being contained within a stretch lasting a page or two of panels. But for a feature-length movie, unless done with some surefire cadence, this formula doesn't quite work.The movie attempts to be a lot like the comic strip, but it only truly achieves that in the art department. The set design by Richard Sylbert and Rick Simmons (who swept away the Academy Award for this film) do a spot-on job of presenting the comic book world in which Dick Tracy inhabits. Not only is the city presented in an almost two-dimensional (and yet eye candy) format, it is painted with the primary colors. Yellow suits, green and purple cars, orangeish streets. The movie really looks fabulous. And the performances all around are quite good. Whenever he's not interacting with Madonna or Miss Headly, Warren Beatty is superb and buttoned-up in the role. The two ladies I mentioned also play their parts well, as does Mr. Korsmo. Mr. Pacino steals the show with his performance, and there are many other notable cameos by people such as Dick Van Dyke as the skeptical D.A. and Dustin Hoffman as the duplicitous Mumbles.Dick Tracy has a lot going for it but that there just might be the problem. It has ambition. Perhaps too much, perhaps too little at the same time. Reportedly, there is a cut of the movie out there encompassing an additional twenty minutes. I hope it sees the light of day, for it just might contain the extra boost that this version that I saw really needs.

One a quiet little botanist (Glenne Headly) the other a sexy nightclub singer (Madonna).Amidst them are countless other peculiar individuals, many of them portrayed by famous stars clad in heavy make-up. But there we have the first of the movie's problems. There are more than twenty characters from the comic strip, all crammed in there so tautly, and yet so desperately for screen attention, that few of them ultimately leave any kind of a mark. Even though R.G. Armstrong and William Forsythe are extremely good in the movie, the only thing really distinguishing is the level of cosmetics applied to their faces. There are so many villains and so many of them demand attention and yet the only one who really stands out is Mr. Pacino, who gives one of the most happily hyperbolic and energetic performances of his career as Big Boy Caprice.Another problem the movie has is an ambition to show and contain so much within so short a window. As a result, many sequences skimp over without leaving any kind of a mark. The denouement, though unexpected by me, came off as kind of flat because of the narrow writing and overly-taut editing. And frankly, even though Mr. Beatty does a great job playing the straight-face detective most of the time, his dynamics with the two central women in the plot are flimsy and not so interesting. Now in a comic strip, one can get away with a narrow narrative and characterizations, because all of that is being contained within a stretch lasting a page or two of panels. But for a feature-length movie, unless done with some surefire cadence, this formula doesn't quite work.The movie attempts to be a lot like the comic strip, but it only truly achieves that in the art department. The set design by Richard Sylbert and Rick Simmons (who swept away the Academy Award for this film) do a spot-on job of presenting the comic book world in which Dick Tracy inhabits. Not only is the city presented in an almost two-dimensional (and yet eye candy) format, it is painted with the primary colors. Yellow suits, green and purple cars, orangeish streets. The movie really looks fabulous. And the performances all around are quite good. Whenever he's not interacting with Madonna or Miss Headly, Warren Beatty is superb and buttoned-up in the role. The two ladies I mentioned also play their parts well, as does Mr. Korsmo. Mr. Pacino steals the show with his performance, and there are many other notable cameos by people such as Dick Van Dyke as the skeptical D.A. and Dustin Hoffman as the duplicitous Mumbles.Dick Tracy has a lot going for it but that there just might be the problem. It has ambition. Perhaps too much, perhaps too little at the same time. Reportedly, there is a cut of the movie out there encompassing an additional twenty minutes. I hope it sees the light of day, for it just might contain the extra boost that this version that I saw really needs.

In the early 1900s, the child Vito flees his Sicilian village for America after the local Mafia kills his family. Vito (Robert De Niro) struggles to make a living, legally or illegally, for his wife and growing brood in Little Italy, killing the local Black Hand Fanucci (Gastone Moschin) after he demands his customary cut of the tyro's business. With Fanucci gone, Vito's communal stature grows, but it is his family (past and present) who matters most to him -- a familial legacy then upended by Michael's (Al Pacino) business expansion in the 1950s. Now based in Lake Tahoe, Michael conspires to make inroads in Las Vegas and Havana pleasure industries by any means necessary. As he realizes that allies like Hyman Roth (Lee Strasberg) are trying to kill him, the increasingly paranoid Michael also discovers that his ambition has crippled his marriage to Kay (Diane Keaton) and turned his brother, Fredo (John Cazale), against him. Barely escaping a federal indictment, Michael turns his attention to dealing with his enemies, completing his own corruption.i am going to give this movie a 5 stars too like Godfather 1 as to me it is as good as the first but with few changes. movie becomes lesser violent and less with twists and turns but gets heavy and thick on plot. we see the past and the present. this is the Best sequel for a movie in the history ever.a masterpiece like the first, an artistic achievement. i really like them and they are entirely different from any other mafia movies ever. they have there own unique story and plot and on the top of that unique style of film making. this movie was far more longer than the first but that is what makes it epic. not a single empty moment, something is happening every time. it was more slower than the first one and some people may have problem with it more slow moving plot but still a movie that is worth of the place it has in the cinematic history.this was and is the first movie sequel in the history of Oscars to win Best Picture. this epic movie was nominated for 11 Oscars winning 6 Oscars including, Best Picture, Director, Adapted screenplay, Dramatic Original Score, Art Direction and Actor in a Supporting Role Robert De Niro. other nominations were Actor In A Lead Role Al Pacino, Actor in a Supporting Role Michael V. Gazzo, Actor In A Supporting Role Lee Strasberg, Actress In A Supporting Role Talia Shire and Costumes Design.again Francis Ford Coppola gave a direction to remember. such a masterful work, excellent direction by this genius. Screenplay was excellent written. plot was breathtaking, again as i said even with less violence and twists and turns as the first still. everything was perfect, cinematography, art direction costumes editing. just a superb work.Al Pacino delivered one of the best performance an actor ever did, one of the best performance i have seen on screen. he truly is the king of mafia movies and this movie series the mother of all modern gangster movies. Al Pacino was breathtakingly superb in it. i wished he should have won the Oscar, he totally deserved it. amazing performance. Robert De Niro who plays the young Vito Corleone was amazing too, outstanding performance by him too. he sounded so much like him everything was perfect but to be honest Al Pacino takes the lead here. the other actors performed exceedingly well too, like Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton, John Cazale , Lee Strasberg , Talia Shire , Danny Aiello , John Aprea , Carmen Argenziano and others. superb performances.this movie features the rise of Michael Corleone in the underworld but his spiritual downfall, he ends up doing what he said and thought he wouldn't ever. then there is the past of Vito Corleone shown which was so good to see. carried off quite well by director.this is an outstanding movie and i don't need to recommend it to you since you might have seen it.

As he realizes that allies like Hyman Roth (Lee Strasberg) are trying to kill him, the increasingly paranoid Michael also discovers that his ambition has crippled his marriage to Kay (Diane Keaton) and turned his brother, Fredo (John Cazale), against him. Barely escaping a federal indictment, Michael turns his attention to dealing with his enemies, completing his own corruption.i am going to give this movie a 5 stars too like Godfather 1 as to me it is as good as the first but with few changes. movie becomes lesser violent and less with twists and turns but gets heavy and thick on plot. we see the past and the present. this is the Best sequel for a movie in the history ever.a masterpiece like the first, an artistic achievement. i really like them and they are entirely different from any other mafia movies ever. they have there own unique story and plot and on the top of that unique style of film making. this movie was far more longer than the first but that is what makes it epic. not a single empty moment, something is happening every time. it was more slower than the first one and some people may have problem with it more slow moving plot but still a movie that is worth of the place it has in the cinematic history.this was and is the first movie sequel in the history of Oscars to win Best Picture. this epic movie was nominated for 11 Oscars winning 6 Oscars including, Best Picture, Director, Adapted screenplay, Dramatic Original Score, Art Direction and Actor in a Supporting Role Robert De Niro. other nominations were Actor In A Lead Role Al Pacino, Actor in a Supporting Role Michael V. Gazzo, Actor In A Supporting Role Lee Strasberg, Actress In A Supporting Role Talia Shire and Costumes Design.again Francis Ford Coppola gave a direction to remember. such a masterful work, excellent direction by this genius. Screenplay was excellent written. plot was breathtaking, again as i said even with less violence and twists and turns as the first still. everything was perfect, cinematography, art direction costumes editing. just a superb work.Al Pacino delivered one of the best performance an actor ever did, one of the best performance i have seen on screen. he truly is the king of mafia movies and this movie series the mother of all modern gangster movies. Al Pacino was breathtakingly superb in it. i wished he should have won the Oscar, he totally deserved it. amazing performance. Robert De Niro who plays the young Vito Corleone was amazing too, outstanding performance by him too. he sounded so much like him everything was perfect but to be honest Al Pacino takes the lead here. the other actors performed exceedingly well too, like Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton, John Cazale , Lee Strasberg , Talia Shire , Danny Aiello , John Aprea , Carmen Argenziano and others. superb performances.this movie features the rise of Michael Corleone in the underworld but his spiritual downfall, he ends up doing what he said and thought he wouldn't ever. then there is the past of Vito Corleone shown which was so good to see. carried off quite well by director.this is an outstanding movie and i don't need to recommend it to you since you might have seen it.

In the early 1900s, the child Vito flees his Sicilian village for America after the local Mafia kills his family. Vito (Robert De Niro) struggles to make a living, legally or illegally, for his wife and growing brood in Little Italy, killing the local Black Hand Fanucci (Gastone Moschin) after he demands his customary cut of the tyro's business. With Fanucci gone, Vito's communal stature grows, but it is his family (past and present) who matters most to him -- a familial legacy then upended by Michael's (Al Pacino) business expansion in the 1950s. Now based in Lake Tahoe, Michael conspires to make inroads in Las Vegas and Havana pleasure industries by any means necessary.
