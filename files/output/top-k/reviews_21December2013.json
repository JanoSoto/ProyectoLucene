[{"date":"21 December 2013","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" PlotThe entire set-up of being placed in the 1950's was a work of genius. They didn't go for the stereotypical look, but actually tried to make accurate without shoving it in your face. I'll talk more about this in the visuals. The plot starts with a giant robot crash landing onto earth. His origins are unknown and aren't important to the movie, which is fine by me. He encounters a boy named Hogarth Hughes. They become friends over-time and soon go through challenges that are caused by paranoia and military suspicion. It's great stuff (And it all makes sense).CharactersHogarth is a very likable and funny pre-teen that has a unique personality. He's described soulfully through dialogue and not directly to the audience. We find out, just as a side trait, that he keeps pets that he finds out in the wild. In the diner his mother works in, they have a minor but funny conversation about the previous pets he's brought in. Speaking of which, his voice and tone he keeps the whole film work nicely; his outbursts aren't whiny, annoying, or irritating. I can't think of another child character in a movie done as well as Hogarth. He's also very clever when it comes to finding ways around obstacles. It's a little hard to describe without going on forever, but his actions, motivations, and lines spoken are... well, just great.The Giant is a character in itself. He's come down to earth for... some mission. But due to a bump on his head, he has amnesia. So, Hogarth takes the chance to teach him and make the robot good-natured. It's a delightful story between the two characters. I wouldn't have minded if there was no action in the movie and just focused on those two. Vin Diesel is great as the Iron Giant, just saying.Oh, and the side-character Dean is the highlight of the movie... I guess?VisualsAs I already stated, the 50's look of this environment is fantastic. There's a scene that takes place after the Giant and Hogarth encounter for the first time where Hogarth is in a classroom. He's busy drawing the Giant in his notebook and arguing with other students. In the background playing on a projector is an Atomic Holocaust Safety Video. Considering it's the 1950's during the Cold War and after World War II, this is a great subtle throw-back to the time period. The people in the diner I already talked about are dressed perfectly for the period. Dean, for some reason, looks like a Greaser, while all the waitresses and waiters wear the correct attire. In a later scene, Hogarth is watching a Black & White Science-fiction horror film (Involving Brains) and eating Twinkies. What's cool is the packaging on the Twinkies is made to look old-school; it's great.SoundMuch like how the sounds the Speeder-bikes from Star Wars made lingered in my minds (And I'm sure a lot of other peoples' minds), the footstep sounds the Giant creates are so memorable. I don't know what it is about them, but I can never get them out of my head. It's part of my collective memory now. The voice of the giant is also memorable. I don't know if it's because of Vin Diesel or the editing process, but the robotic voice the Giant gives is something that might give you an eargasm. It's just absolutely crazy how cool his voice sounds.Of course, the one of the bigger reasons this criteria gets a five star is the musical soundtrack. It's one of the best scores I've ever heard. Right up there with some of John Williams' work. I'm not kidding.EnjoymentEvery time I went to my neighbors' house to be babysat, I watched this movie. I must've watched this film over thirty times. I've honestly lost track, and yet, it still doesn't get old. I loved this film as a kid and I love it now. I can't say much else but, GO WATCH IT!
