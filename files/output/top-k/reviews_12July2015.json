And of course, the goofy and lighthearted situations that arise from all of the above.The songs were Let It Go level that got stuck in your head. They left you humming or singing them everyday for months afterward. And no matter how long it's been, the moment you hear them, you're hit with a blast of nostalgia all over again.This is a movie all parents should watch with their kids, as well as a must have for Nostalgia Nights when you reach back into the vault of your movie collection. If theaters had Nostalgia Night\/Month with such films being brought back, It's a guarantee that attendance would boom.Thanks for reading. Have a good day.

It was a summer in the early 90s, there was a massive heat wave going on and whenever you watched TV or shuffled through magazines, you couldn't get around something not related to this movie. The hype about it was out of this world, seemingly even more than Batman got, which also was unreal. Everybody seemed to blown away by it and the commercials and trailers really got you pumped. Naturally, I was too young to watch it at the cinema, and that's something I am truly envious of people who did first time, so I had to wait until it was shown at a pay TV channel at my uncles apartment. And boy, it left an impact that sticks to this very day, more than 20 years later. If you by any chance haven't seen it yet, stop right there - go watch this movie with a good set-up with big speakers and a big screen, you can thank me later.Regardless how I look at it, how this movie excels at seemingly everything is fascinating to say the least. Starting from the powerful and symbolic intro with the beautifully emotional score to the countless memorable and instant classic moments until the last lines of the simple yet incredibly effective epilogue, all of it feels like everyone involved in it knew exactly what they want to do, how to do it and why. It may be even more rare than winning the lottery. The level of production, amount of talent and creativity involved is something that no one came even close probably until The Matrix.The first striking impression about it is obviously the action and rightfully so as it is indeed groundbreaking. I still remember people talking about how amazing the chase scene where the truck drives of the bridge was. Even more impressive is that each and every action scene is consistent in quality so that you're constantly wowed by what is happening. The stunts are insane and hold up to this day and will years to come.But don't let it's bombastic action and one-liners lead you into believing that it's all about it. No, there is so much more to it. Terminator 2 has evolving characters, each interesting and equally likable, a superb script which in clever ways expands on what already did happen and ads new twists to it, a deep story that deals with legitimate fears about bringing our own doom by constantly developing new, potentially dangerous inventions, about destiny, hope and what makes us human. Aside from all that, similar to the first movie, it retains the grueling tension and sense of danger that sometimes is on par with horror movies. A big contribution to this is of course the character T-1000 played by Robert Patrick. He truly understood how to make his character as intimidating and menacing as possible; that aura he has about him and frightening, cold stare is something only he can pull off. But it's not only his amazing performance, James Camerons direction is as equally important to make him so fear inducing. Every time he appears on screen you can hear his theme that has so much intensity to it that it always gave me a feeling of uneasiness and not without reason as he kills his victims in nightmarish ways without flinching. It wouldn't be as half as tense were it PG-13 I assure you.Everyones performance in it is great. Arnold Schwarzenegger is incredibly professional, bad-ass, serious but with so much style and a bit of subtle humor in just the right doses. Linda Hamilton with perhaps the most difficult character to pull off but does it completely convincingly with a remarkable power performance through emotions, Edward Furlog as the charismatic 90s kid, both believable and relate-able. And so on and so forth. The true star however has to James Cameron, the man that managed it all. He must've have some sort of sixth sense in order to have a such clear vision of what he wanted in each in every scene, and it's not just the whole big picture of it, but all the small things too. How he build up that mall scene is just one of many displays of his genius.Its perfect as filmmaking gets. If I had to nit-pick I'd say that in the second half are some slight lengths and it slows down a bit until the final confrontation, but in all honesty it is absolutely insignificant and minor. It's through and through fun, tense, smart, horrifying, cool, emotional... all the good stuff. I can't praise it enough, the music, the tone of the movie with its blue and black colours, the make-up, the truly convincing special effects which don't feel artificial as they do in newer movies and nowadays... just everything I possibly could think of is on a whole different level. Words don't do it justice, it needs to be seen. Even now, 24 years later, it still holds up extremely well and that alone is a testament on what of an accomplishment this movie is.

I remember watching the Karate Kid back in High School for Japanese class the whole class sat there and loved it. This in itself was a first because the class was not fond of learning Japanese.After seeing it again by myself years later it was even better! The music, the dialogue, the good vs evil, the chemistry between Daniel LaRusso (Ralph Macchio) Ali (Elisabeth Shue)and Mr Miyagi (Pat Morita) all this with the 80's what more can I say.The directing of this movie was in my view the best. John G. Avildsen you knew what you wanted to do and done it very well. All of the actors were perfect for the roles they played especially the bad guys.The Karate Kid still being referred to today as being one of the best movies of all time even in 2015 (31 years later!) This just shows that it has stood the test of time and beaten many newer movies made with the same good vs evil in mind.The new Karate Kid (2010) I haven't even seen and don't plan on watching either as you can not beat the original Karate Kid (1984) it doesn't matter how hard you try.The 80's Nostalgia in the Karate Kid maybe that is what keeps me coming back to watching it again and again. But it doesn't matter the movie was that well made with so many symbols of good vs evil (right and wrong). On each viewing you pick up something new that you didn't catch before. The symbols such as the relationships in the movie how they grow and the chemistry and trust that keeps building with Daniel and Mr Miyagi is just brilliant and something everyone can see and relate to.I will probably wear the Karate Kid Blu-ray disc edition out soon I have played the movie that many times but I don't care I will just buy The Karate Kid again and watch it another 50 times because that is just how good this movie is.If you are a young family with young kids I couldn't think of a more suitable movie for the whole family to watch. This movie would teach more to your kids than an entire year of school. That is how to treat your fellow man and how to act in society.

It doesn't reach the cinematic levels of Star Wars and The Empire Strikes Back. The story here lightens up the tone, since the last film's tone was dark, bleak, and depressing. This is evident with the inclusion of the Ewoks. They are teddy- bear-like aliens who lived on Endor, which was where the movie's second and third act took place at. They're cute and all, but they got on my nerves. I would have preferred it, if they were Wookies or some reptilian aliens. Besides that, the story built up slowly, but effectively to the final battle at the end. There's a battle in the planet, space, and the second Death Star. It offers some of the trilogy's greatest moments and it's the trilogy's special effects at their finest. The cast here are just as great as before. Luke Skywalker here is a completely different person, from the first movie. We get to watch him change from an immature and naive, farmer boy to a mature and wise, Jedi. Darth Vadar, who was a cruel and relentless villain in the last film, redeems himself and becomes a last-minute- hero at the end. The Special Edition for this movie is the WORST. It ruins perfect scenes and fills me with rage, every time I watch this movie. Return of the Jedi is a perfect ending to a perfect trilogy. It's not perfect, but it's SO MUCH better than the Star Wars prequels.

I do see some good in it. Michael Cimino had a fanatical attention to detail, which I am willing to admit that he did. The cinematography- shot primarily in Montana- was easily the best thing about the movie, as it does exploit the landscape with awe. The music- mostly adapted from other sources- was nicely arranged, capturing the time of that movie. However, unless it's Koyaanisqatsi, one can't get away with just cinematography and music. The story is primarily where the movie falters. There are long stretches of this movie's three-and-a-half running time where nothing of note happens and, by the time it does, one generally has stopped caring. Most of the actors do their best with what they have. While I don't think much of Kris Kristofferson as an actor, he does what he can. Christopher Walken and Jeff Bridges are too good of actors to give anything less than their best. I have to say that Isabelle Huppert was gravely miscast. I'm sure that there were plenty of unknown American actresses (I say this knowing the names of those who refused it) who would have jumped at the chance to work with such a high-profile director of the time working on such a high-profile movie. In the end, it is neither the unqualified disaster Vincent Canby saw or the tainted masterpiece that people seem to currently see. Rather, it is exactly in the middle of those two.

In the movie's defense, however, they did have only one good song (the end credit's When the Going Gets Tough, the Tough Get Going by Billy Ocean,) a couple of lines were actually good (yeah, I counted only two) and the cast actually looked like they were trying to show up. Other than those positives, this movie shouldn't have been made.While they took the jungle out of Jack from the first movie and made him an Indiana Jones rip-off, they did keep the same story that Joan is highly respected and sought out, despite her writing garbage novels. Basically the rest of the story involves a mesh-up of the first two Indy films that actually had me continuously check the time left and my mind wandering.The first isn't great, but it's a fun, no-harm adventure. This is the second Staying Alive\/pointless sequel of the 1980s. Avoid. * * *Final thoughts Surprisingly, in a movie that had ho-hum and far from fresh dialogue, one of two lines stood out and actually made me laugh out loud Don't be ridiculous.

With technical achievements and some fine acting performances this becomes not only better than the first in the series, but also just one of the finest entries into the much paved action movie catalogue. Arnold Schwarzenegger returns from the first and so does Sarah Connor, and both are well played and make this story exciting, action packed and even quite surprisingly, emotional.This movie is to be fair all about the destruction of John Connor, but I mean that in a way where Robert Patrick is thrown back from the future to try and kill the future human rebel leader. This time the T-800 model otherwise known as the Terminator is back, and now he's had a change of heart, no not really he has just been reprogrammed by John Connor in the future. This plot can seem a little confusing but trust me it is not, it's actually a fine story full of fun moments but a whole lot of down right action fuelled adventure.The young man playing the well, young John Connor is Edward Furlong, and he gives a pretty nasty yet good performance, mixing the juvenile teenage rage with raw emotion to create an all together nice feel. Arnie returns with fist pumping muscle and some massive guns and becomes the stuff of legends(quite literally, he makes this classic movie icon). The director, James Cameron, the writer James Cameron(plus William Wisher), and oh my what a movie he has created. He finely crafts this with a fine touch, he never lets this get boring and somehow makes a movie that is exciting from the first minute to the end.Does the movie lack anything?, well yes, yes it does. It for me lacks a slight bit of depth, it does it well and anyone who see's the relationship between the Terminator and John will be all quite happy for cyborg-human relations. I do however feel this isn't as intelligent as it maybe thinks it is, and for that point and that point alone, it makes this oh so close to perfection, without being perfect. Now of course saying all this, many many people will give this 10\/10 and the such, I think it is incredible and truly a movie to behold so don't hold it against me that I don't think this is 100% flawless, it is for me, probably one of the best movies ever.When you think of a sequel you think many things will return from the first and not only that but also, the sequel will not be as good. It's wrong on the point of it's not as good as it's predecessor, but it also feels new and unique, very different to the 1984 first in line The Terminator which although I felt was good, is not a patch on this one. It feels slick, new and all together more thought out, Cameron seems to get his act and give it another level meanwhile Hamilton, Schwarzenegger and Robert Patrick etc, also do the same.Terminator 2 is one of those movies you don't forget after watching, I recommend this not only to action fans who maybe haven't ever seen it, but also any movie fan, this is top class stuff. I never thought I'd be saying that an action Sci-Fi was so good but I can't deny it anything, even the score from Brad Fiedel deserves a shout out, all together top notch work from all departments involved.

I thought the idea to put the ending in the beginning the beginning at the end and everything mixed up in between was genius total genius. The movie showed us what it would be like to see reality in a way someone who is in their head might see it. Ultimate movie classic it is up there with some of the best. Titles like A Clockwork Orange, Rocky Horror Picture Show, Shock Treatment, Natural Born Killers, and Cry Baby to name a few. But that list goes on and on. We need more movies like this and the others, it's great they want to make remakes of movies, but the originals that take creative thinking to a whole new level are the best. I love the ones that push the limits and boundaries to make us go huh and they did not go there.

We need more movies like this and the others, it's great they want to make remakes of movies, but the originals that take creative thinking to a whole new level are the best.

","genre":"Crime, Drama"},{"date":"12 July 2015","score":"","review":" The Double Life of Veronique very much lies in that grey area of cinema where nothing quite makes sense, but everything does seem to all connect together on some strange, indecipherable level. A famous example of this is Mullholland Drive - nobody has ever really been able to give a straight forward solution as to what the film is about, but it's still a very affecting piece of work, and the main comparison I had in my head while watching this film.This is a completely different movie, though, and what it achieves is much more impressive in my eyes. The plot couldn't be a whole load simpler; two women, identical in looks, age, and name, lead parallel lives - one in France, one in Poland. One day, one of our heroines catches a glimpse of the other by chance, seemingly setting in motion a chain of events I won't describe, lest I spoil it for everyone. Needless to say, it's an outlandish plot, but Kielowski wisely doesn't question this.Instead of focusing on its plot, it instead focuses on nailing down the eerie atmosphere that permeates nearly every scene - a strategy that absolutely pays off. Very few films out of the horror genre manage to capture such an atmosphere and it's staggeringly impressive, thanks in no small part Iréne Jacob - an actress who by now is slightly forgotten, but has given performances that would be career-best for many Hollywood stars. This is definitely one of them, capturing a wide-eyed innocence and strength that few actresses ever manage.A lot of thought is given to what this film means. It's a fair question, but as I mulled it over in my head afterwards, I realized it's not really the point. The film itself is the one searching for the meaning, and while it has no answers, its questions are much more engaging. My interpretation is that Kielowski is asking whether or not we aren't actually as alone as we like to think we are sometimes - that there are forces, far beyond our comprehension, pulling strings and making things happen. Almost everything that happens in this film appears distorted or magnified somewhere else in its running time - repeated, endlessly, forming patterns. It's not going to suit every taste, but it's a fascinating look at a take on life that most wouldn't have thought of.

Alec Baldwin is far from my favorite, but as Jack Ryan...he is perfect. Sean Connery can make anything sound like Scotish Poetry, and Sam Niel is the consummate XO with eyes outfitted with that dear-in- the-headlight look.
