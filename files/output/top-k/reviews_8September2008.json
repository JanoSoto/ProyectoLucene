However familiarity does breed a little contempt especially when the story is as fantastical again as Carrie, which is probably why I prefer the director's slightly more realistically grounded projects of around this time, like Blow-Out or Dressed to Kill, both highly stylised but just about believable murder-thrillers. The movie looks incredibly dated in the here and now, the actors all look like they could have walked off the set of Dallas, plus sadly some of the acting isn't far above soap-opera standard either. It's weird to see the great Kirk Douglas in the lead part and his legendary status for me detracts from any empathy you may have for his character - he's really too big for the part and he can't act down into his role. There are some attempts at humour but these too fall flat, particularly the extended early sequence when Douglas hi-jacks a dysfunctional middle-aged typical American family whilst on the run from the baddies, led by John Cassavetes. And quite why he sees fit to make a touring Saudi-Arabian party the innocent victims of Douglas' son's powers at the theme park, I couldn't fathom either. That said this isn't really a movie for actors...Hitchcock-like, De Palma here, as in so many of his movies, manipulates his players (sheep-like, dare I say) into his story until we reach the over-the-top conclusion. What you tend to look for in early De Palma instead are the directorial flourishes - these sometimes come off (the various connections between the possessed youngsters, the slow-motion death of Hester) and sometimes not (the initial kidnapping scene and the crashing merry-go-round, fail to grip or convince). Still worth watching though as a relic of the 70's but very much locked into that particular time-warp.

It was nominated for two Academy Awards; Best Director, and Best Original Screenplay- by Antonioni, Tonino Guerra, and Edward Bond- adapted from the short story Las Babas Del Diablo, by Argentine writer Julio Cortazar, and won the National Society Of Film Critics title as best film of 1967. Having first seen the two Hollywood films most influenced by it- Francis Ford Coppola's The Conversation, in 1974, and Brian De Palma's Blowout, in 1981, I did not know quite what to expect, since the former is also a great film- arguably Coppola's best, and the latter is a merely solid Hollywood thriller. Blowup is not only a great work of art, but a great work of philosophy. It is arguably as great as Antonioni's earlier Italian language masterpiece, La Notte, and the film caused a bit of a scandal upon its release, both for its showing casual sex and drug usage, and for its female nudity. Of course, forty years later, this all seems a bit silly, as tame as the scenes really are to the modern eye.The story follows an unnamed photographer (David Hemmings) who may or may not have inadvertently captured a murder on film, which may or may not involve a mysterious young woman (Vanessa Redgrave) who later visits the photographer in his studio, ready to have sex with him to retrieve the photos before he develops them. Both of the main characters are never named in the film, despite numerous reviews that call the two main characters Thomas and Jane. In watching the film twice- with and without commentary, I found zero in the way of evidence to support this claim of their being named, so I take it as one of those bits of information that gets repeated ad nauseam by bad critics until accepted, despite its being untrue. Possibly there were press kits that named the two characters, but they are not named within, nor in the credits. Yet, this very lack of names only makes the film all the more interesting, for not knowing the truth of these two characters only heightens their mysteriousness, and the events that ensnare the both of them. The photographer even sardonically comments in the film, when he's about to lay two girls- or 'birds', 'What's the use of a name?'Hemmings is a famed photographer whom we first see emerging from a London flophouse, just one of a crowd- not unlike the Carlo Battisti character in Vittorio De Sica's Umberto D., where he's gotten some great and intimate photos of the poor, which he plans on using in a book. He posed as a poor guy to get them, yet hops into his convertible wood paneled Rolls Royce. We then see him rather misogynistically mistreat a high fashion and clearly pre-anorexia nervosa anorexic supermodel (Verushka) in the grotesque Twiggy vein- whom, in a famed scene, he erotically 'mounts', as he photographs her from above as she lies on the floor, five models who pose behind dark glass screens, and the two 'birds' in pink and green pantyhose. We also find out he lives next door to an Abstract Expressionist painter, Bill (John Castle), and his girlfriend, Patricia (Sarah Miles), whom he has an unspoken attraction to, and who seems to return his feelings. In describing his paintings, Bill says he has no intent when he starts a painting, and that meaning only comes later. This is a key to the film, or at least the viewer's warning on how to take what they see&#133;.Others have laid bare the plot.Like Akira Kurosawa's classic film Rashomon, Blowup works on many levels, yet allows us to participate in the interpretation to an even greater extent than Rashomon. Photographs can lie- just ask AP photographer Eddie Adams, who, a few years later took the infamous photograph of a Vietnamese police commander shooting a Vietcong prisoner in the head. What was not shown was that the prisoner had killed many innocent people. By going beyond being a mere whodunit, and engaging the very the meaning of meaning, itself, Blowup (and it is Blowup, not Blow-Up, as on the DVD cover) illustrates the differences between the writer and the visual artist. The former elicits significance from things that need to be seen, while the latter does so from that already seen. In truth, there could be plausible and non-criminal reasons for all that happens in the film, and only the dull life of Hemmings spurs him on to imbue significance. That we can never know the real truth within the film is the real truth as to why this film never loses its hold in repeated viewings. On that score, no comment is needed.

","genre":"Drama, Mystery, Thriller"},{"date":"8 September 2008","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Child's Play 2, like so many other films in its respective 'slasher' sub-genre, begs the question at probably around about the hour mark, by which time we'll have seen a couple of grizzly ends, 'are we still scared by something that's been happening for the last sixty minutes?' Sure, cheap thrills and the odd manifested jump are good fun but after a while a few of these do wear you down and the film feels like a procession. Child's Play 2 is one of these films that is good for what it is but the ambiguity surrounding the young hero's mental state and the consistent feeling you have that a character is about to get eliminated makes you weary.The returning hero is Andy Barclay (Vincent) and whilst he won't need quite as much child counselling as Rachel Carruthers' little sister in Halloween 4, it's probably still recommended. But Andy's suffering is escalated in this film, nicely put across in the film's opening. Andy is adopted by some foster parents that put across an uncomfortable feeling for the audience to endure, mostly down to the fact the father isn't sure on whether he wants a foster-child in the first place and Andy's time at school is difficult with particular attention paid to bullies and strict teachers.But while the parents that are Phil (Graham) and Joanne (Agutter) come across as quite useless, Andy's one mentor that it seems can keep him safe or is at least on his level is his new foster-sister, Kyle (Elsie). Combining the protagonist's sister of sorts as a motherly figure is a brave move for the film to take &#150; it echoes the work psychoanalytic theorists might undertake when studying a disturbed child's psychosis and whom a really young child may latch onto when seeking a motherly figure of sorts. In this case, Andy fits the bill as the disturbed child and perhaps the equally disturbed Kyle slots into place as the young but old enough for Andy's sake motherly figure whom must protect him and help him through any obstacles.Although Child's Play 2 remains nothing spectacular. The film is really a series of events that place the child in a string of unnerving and unpleasant situations. The main source for suspense lies in the manner of which Andy tries to convince those around him, haplessly, that he is innocent of doing certain things like breaking a family ornament, and that Chucky is the reason. We know it wasn't Andy but his superiors have no reason to suspect otherwise thus rendering the scenes effective in their own right but somewhat disturbing from the audience's point of view &#150; this is largely down to how we react to seeing very young children being put in vulnerable positions and made to look incorrect.But this segment of the film has this and only this going for it. There is a bit of suspense and some nicely timed comic touches when another, less animated, Chucky doll is around and the evil Chucky must remember what his name was upon taking identity. Then there is the scene in which Kyle finds the doll buried in the garden and the penny drops. The trouble is, we, or at least I, wouldn't have cared if Chucky had won these battles. If we look at the possible knife fodder in the opening exchanges, they consist of Andy (who we don't want to be harmed); Kyle (who we progressively don't want harmed); the foster parents (who we don't really mind seeing harmed), Andy's teacher (who we wouldn't mind seeing harmed) and some of the meaner kids at the school. Trouble is, if Chucky kills some of these characters as you're watching the film it wouldn't be all that bad because of the manner in which they're put across initially. This results in us siding with the villain which can be fun at times in other films perhaps but not here.So if the film is at its most effective during these exchanges in the first hour, then what follows surely relegates the film to the level of failure.

Sure, cheap thrills and the odd manifested jump are good fun but after a while a few of these do wear you down and the film feels like a procession. Child's Play 2 is one of these films that is good for what it is but the ambiguity surrounding the young hero's mental state and the consistent feeling you have that a character is about to get eliminated makes you weary.The returning hero is Andy Barclay (Vincent) and whilst he won't need quite as much child counselling as Rachel Carruthers' little sister in Halloween 4, it's probably still recommended. But Andy's suffering is escalated in this film, nicely put across in the film's opening. Andy is adopted by some foster parents that put across an uncomfortable feeling for the audience to endure, mostly down to the fact the father isn't sure on whether he wants a foster-child in the first place and Andy's time at school is difficult with particular attention paid to bullies and strict teachers.But while the parents that are Phil (Graham) and Joanne (Agutter) come across as quite useless, Andy's one mentor that it seems can keep him safe or is at least on his level is his new foster-sister, Kyle (Elsie). Combining the protagonist's sister of sorts as a motherly figure is a brave move for the film to take &#150; it echoes the work psychoanalytic theorists might undertake when studying a disturbed child's psychosis and whom a really young child may latch onto when seeking a motherly figure of sorts. In this case, Andy fits the bill as the disturbed child and perhaps the equally disturbed Kyle slots into place as the young but old enough for Andy's sake motherly figure whom must protect him and help him through any obstacles.Although Child's Play 2 remains nothing spectacular. The film is really a series of events that place the child in a string of unnerving and unpleasant situations. The main source for suspense lies in the manner of which Andy tries to convince those around him, haplessly, that he is innocent of doing certain things like breaking a family ornament, and that Chucky is the reason. We know it wasn't Andy but his superiors have no reason to suspect otherwise thus rendering the scenes effective in their own right but somewhat disturbing from the audience's point of view &#150; this is largely down to how we react to seeing very young children being put in vulnerable positions and made to look incorrect.But this segment of the film has this and only this going for it. There is a bit of suspense and some nicely timed comic touches when another, less animated, Chucky doll is around and the evil Chucky must remember what his name was upon taking identity. Then there is the scene in which Kyle finds the doll buried in the garden and the penny drops. The trouble is, we, or at least I, wouldn't have cared if Chucky had won these battles. If we look at the possible knife fodder in the opening exchanges, they consist of Andy (who we don't want to be harmed); Kyle (who we progressively don't want harmed); the foster parents (who we don't really mind seeing harmed), Andy's teacher (who we wouldn't mind seeing harmed) and some of the meaner kids at the school. Trouble is, if Chucky kills some of these characters as you're watching the film it wouldn't be all that bad because of the manner in which they're put across initially. This results in us siding with the villain which can be fun at times in other films perhaps but not here.So if the film is at its most effective during these exchanges in the first hour, then what follows surely relegates the film to the level of failure.

This caused a deep rift between the couple, for John is a born-and-raised Big Apple resident and he doesn't want to leave the city, no matter how big his wife's salary is. Over the holidays, they are going to try to come to a resolution. Yet, when John enters the skyscraper headquarters of the Japanese company, his wife is committed to helping with the holiday party that is in full swing and he goes to a washroom to clean up. Just at that moment, a German terrorist, Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman) and his gang take over the building in a near-perfect seizure and the employees are turned into hostages. The German thug is after the million dollar bonds that are locked away in a heavily-fortressed vault. Meanwhile, McClane manages to slip away to the elevator shaft to spy on the crooks. It is John, then, who witnesses Hans executing the Japanese CEO when the businessman does not give the gang leader the combination fast enough. Hans, it seems, believes that the computer expert he brought with him will be able to crack the code. As it may take hours, however, John has some time to find a way to stop the killers. But, can one man really do the impossible? This is a very exciting film, with plenty of white-knuckle action and suspense.

He had a disagreement with some English soldier\/occupiers while he was apparently fishing and had to go on the run and, the English, in trying to get at him did burn down his house with his wife inside and he did revenge her murder. He did achieve a great tactical victory over a superior English force at Stirling Bridge which was achieved more by the nature of the swampy terrain and the narrow bridge than by what is depicted in the film as a battle on an open plain with a cavalry charge defeated by pointed sticks. The English were supposedly shocked by the savagery of the Scots who systematically slaughtered all the injured English on the battlefield and it is alleged that Wallace himself had a sword belt made from the skin of the English commander of the battle. He was betrayed by the rest of the Scottish nobles at Falkirk, who refused to lend him their support. Robert the Bruce's father did have leprosy which Robert himself ultimately also succumbed to. Wallace never did meet the Princess of Wales since he was dead three years before her arrival in England and Edward de Longchamps outlived Wallace for some three years also and whilst Edward Prince of Wales may have been exaggeratedly or misleadingly portrayed as an exteremely camp weak prince, there is considerable evidence to indicate that he was a homosexual, this in spite of producing a number of offspring with his French wife including Edward III, who ultimately overthrew him with the assistance of his mother. However, if all these hard facts had been adhered to too rigidly would it have made for near as good of a movie? I don't think so. There are a number of excellent scenes within the movie, most notably Wallace's visit to the English military camp to revenge his wife's murder, The Freedom speech before the battle of Stirling is probably one of the best in movie history, all the battle scenes are magnificently if gorily realised and the final execution scene is both graphic, harrowing and inspiring and overall the graphic gore developed within this movie was ultimately to become Gibson's trademark and that which was to invite so much criticism in The Passion. This is a truly inspiring film, perhaps not entirely nor anywhere near historically accurate, but in terms of large scale entertainment and the realisation of a vision in cinema it is a great achievement, right up there with Spartacus and Ben Hur, and well worthy of the recognition it received.

Watching this movie by myself for the first time, I found it retains the frightening elements that stood out to me in the past. Hellraiser is equal parts spiritual\/psychological\/contemplative horror and gore. The highlights of the film are the Cenobites -- minions of hell and purveyors of sinister, dark pleasures beyond the threshold of mortal perception. The movie begins with Frank, a guy on a mad quest for said dark pleasures beyond the human realm of perception, who purchases a strange box and naively summons the Cenobites to appear. Frank disappears and his brother, Larry and Larry's wife, Julia, inherit the house. Of course, the box is still present, Frank isn't quite dead in the typical sense, and hideous hi-jinks are bound to ensue. Hellraiser set a benchmark when it came out, with a new standard of mainstream horror and gore. Several scenes had to be edited or cut out of the film to receive an appropriate R rating for theatrical release. But it is not merely a gore-fest, but features psychological and dark spiritual elements that are far more curious and horrifying than any of the violence. Indeed, merely these psychological elements would have been enough to scare the viewer, but combined with the excellent make-up and dusty atmosphere the movie becomes a very vivid, intoxicating experience. My main qualm with the whole movie was how the film paced so slowly in the middle and focused so much on the family members, yet never really exposed very much about them. We don't see much about the dynamics or quality of the love triangle between Julia and Frank or Larry. We do understand how they are linked in theory, but it's so impersonally displayed -- they might as well be silhouettes. The same goes for Larry's daughter, Kristy, and her relationship with her stepmother.This detracts from the movie because it is a fairly lengthy film (almost 2 hours) which takes place mostly in one dimly lit house. And though the demonic Cenobites (the lead one being the famous recurring 'Pinhead' character) are the notable centerpiece of the film, they appear sparingly -- though to great horrific effect when they do.This is notable of the first Hellraiser film, the only one completely written and directed by Clive Barker the Cenobites are not typical character villains, but horrific spiritual entities that lay beyond our sensory perceptions. Their ghoulish power exceeds mere evil; they are deep, authentic arbiters of the desire realm. In this sense, Hellraiser distinguishes itself from its contemporary horror films -- typical slashers, torture porn and suspense-horror. The Cenobites are not really villains because they are beyond human and have no hunger for victims. They answer and assist those who summon them, whether or not the summoning is intentional. In fact, the most disturbing facet of these characters is how mesmerizing and intriguing they are, how potently ugly they are, and how easily the viewer is pulled in while they're on the screen. That infatuation is genuinely scary.The later films would fail to capitalize on this subtle-yet-sophisticated brand of horror and degenerate into average or above-average supernatural-slasher films. But the first one is fairly true to Clive Barker's literary vision and features amazing special effects. Even today the hideous, gory make-up and sinister creature designs are steps beyond anything else in film. This is a truly dark film, one which takes cues from H.P. Lovecraft and may have inspired the brilliant Japanese animation, Berserk.

Indeed, merely these psychological elements would have been enough to scare the viewer, but combined with the excellent make-up and dusty atmosphere the movie becomes a very vivid, intoxicating experience. My main qualm with the whole movie was how the film paced so slowly in the middle and focused so much on the family members, yet never really exposed very much about them. We don't see much about the dynamics or quality of the love triangle between Julia and Frank or Larry. We do understand how they are linked in theory, but it's so impersonally displayed -- they might as well be silhouettes. The same goes for Larry's daughter, Kristy, and her relationship with her stepmother.This detracts from the movie because it is a fairly lengthy film (almost 2 hours) which takes place mostly in one dimly lit house. And though the demonic Cenobites (the lead one being the famous recurring 'Pinhead' character) are the notable centerpiece of the film, they appear sparingly -- though to great horrific effect when they do.This is notable of the first Hellraiser film, the only one completely written and directed by Clive Barker the Cenobites are not typical character villains, but horrific spiritual entities that lay beyond our sensory perceptions. Their ghoulish power exceeds mere evil; they are deep, authentic arbiters of the desire realm. In this sense, Hellraiser distinguishes itself from its contemporary horror films -- typical slashers, torture porn and suspense-horror. The Cenobites are not really villains because they are beyond human and have no hunger for victims. They answer and assist those who summon them, whether or not the summoning is intentional. In fact, the most disturbing facet of these characters is how mesmerizing and intriguing they are, how potently ugly they are, and how easily the viewer is pulled in while they're on the screen. That infatuation is genuinely scary.The later films would fail to capitalize on this subtle-yet-sophisticated brand of horror and degenerate into average or above-average supernatural-slasher films. But the first one is fairly true to Clive Barker's literary vision and features amazing special effects. Even today the hideous, gory make-up and sinister creature designs are steps beyond anything else in film. This is a truly dark film, one which takes cues from H.P.

Watching this movie by myself for the first time, I found it retains the frightening elements that stood out to me in the past. Hellraiser is equal parts spiritual\/psychological\/contemplative horror and gore. The highlights of the film are the Cenobites -- minions of hell and purveyors of sinister, dark pleasures beyond the threshold of mortal perception. The movie begins with Frank, a guy on a mad quest for said dark pleasures beyond the human realm of perception, who purchases a strange box and naively summons the Cenobites to appear. Frank disappears and his brother, Larry and Larry's wife, Julia, inherit the house. Of course, the box is still present, Frank isn't quite dead in the typical sense, and hideous hi-jinks are bound to ensue. Hellraiser set a benchmark when it came out, with a new standard of mainstream horror and gore. Several scenes had to be edited or cut out of the film to receive an appropriate R rating for theatrical release.

I think that its premise it is too silly and I did not believe it as a film.The plot of Con Air is that ex-US Ranger and war veteran Cameron Poe (Nicholas Cage) protects his pregnant wife from two drunks, and accidentally kills one of them. He pleads manslaughter, but gets the maximum sentence. He ends up going to the maximum security prison San Quetin in California. When Cameron serves his sentence he goes on a prison plane back to Alabama, with dangerous criminals including terrorists, murderers and rapists. One criminal, Cyrus The Virus (John Malkovich) leads the criminals to over take the plane and negotiate with the FBI to let them go to a foreign country and disappear. But Cameron is on hand to help stop this, and works with the FBI to get the plane back on track.I don't have a great knowledge of the American legal and prison system, but I find that some of the aspect of the film too silly. Examples are that Cameron gets the maximum sentence considering his case, that the US prison system would transport a lot of prisons on plane, which in itself is dumb, but also use idiotic that there were only a few guards, with no major weapons. The plot of the film too implausible. I don't see why the Americans needed to transport the prisoners, and why when the prisoners took over the plane that the Americans didn't just send the Air Force to shot it down. I know that it wouldn't have made a very romantic film, that's what would have really happened. There is a lot that happens in this film that feels that you need to suspend belief to accept it, like the plane clash landing in Las Vegas. The writing is very weak, I did not believe in the film and some aspects of the story are force, especially Cameron's relationship with his daughter. I also doubt that the writer did much research for this film and it may as well have been written by a computer. The biggest problem was the character Cyrus the Virus and John Malkovich pretty much stole the show. He was good in this film and I thought that he should have been used as a villain in another film. It is high to sympathy with some of the characters, considering the crimes they committed. But at the same time Cyrus is the best think in this film There was also a good cast in this film, having good actors like Ving Rhames, Steve Buscemi, John Cusack, Danny Trejo and of course Malkovich.

Nashville is a Robert Altman film and that's as close to a guarantee of a well directed, well acted film as one's likely to find in 70's cinema. However Nashville is also an almost three hour film and for its duration and amount of talent involved the payoff is not what one would expect.Now what is it that we all look for in movies of Nashville's calibre? Why do we ask in exchange for our money and undivided attention to the screen? I'd say it's little moments of insight; into ourselves, human nature, the world by and large. Nashville has them. So what's the problem you say? The problem is that they're buried and suffocating under the enormous weight of the rest of the movie, a barrage of country and western songs, five or ten actors crammed in every other shot, three or four people talking one over the other, a narrative slump of miniplots that criss cross in every scene. Typical Altman quirks yes but here they trump what in other cases they help surface substance.The double axis Nashville revolves around is music and politics. An interesting combination subject in and off itself. Altman follows a reverse process, he wisely takes these two universal concepts and limits their scope significantly, music becomes the country scene of Nashville and politics a political convention of the Replacement Party. Altman lets the universal spring from the specific, for in the end of the day, despite man's countless efforts to prove the opposite, we have more in common than not. A naive, almost pathetic waitress's dream of becoming a country singer should resonate as powerfully in every culture. In that sense Nashville is more about human beings, their dreams, ambitions, secrets and inadequacies than it is about music or politics.The politics part of Nashville is handled equally breezy and smart. Politics is largely an abstract concept for the average person, an unseen, unknown force that magically appears in television screens, newspapers and radios and governs our lives. Altman translates that same essence in the form of a political campaign van that appears throughout the movie, the unseen speaker making promises of change with a monotonous voice. The actual presidential candidate he represents never appears in the movie. He remains elusive and unseen.However well crafted and intelligent in the handling of theme Nashville may be, in the end it's those little moments of insight into human nature that count. The charming, young country singer talking on the phone with his girlfriend while the older, married woman he just had sex with prepares to leave the room, unable to hear what is being said. The husband of said married woman who has his suspicions about the strange phonecalls his wife receives hits on the naive waitress that wants to be a star. The waitress whose lack of talent is only surpassed by her naive ambition that is driven to do a striptease in a room full of men with the promise of singing with country star Baby Jane. Baby Jane is a popular and beautiful country star only on the outside, on the inside she's fragile, neurotic and empty.The problem with Nashville is that those little moments of insight are dwarfed by the entirety of the movie. Many of the singing scenes for example should have been left on the cutting room floor - not everyone is a country fan after all, we get the gist now move on. In the end the way I see it is that if I'm gonna give you almost three hours of my life, you better have something really important to say. Nashville is only mildly important and not as entertaining as it would have you believe.

Nashville is a Robert Altman film and that's as close to a guarantee of a well directed, well acted film as one's likely to find in 70's cinema. However Nashville is also an almost three hour film and for its duration and amount of talent involved the payoff is not what one would expect.Now what is it that we all look for in movies of Nashville's calibre? Why do we ask in exchange for our money and undivided attention to the screen? I'd say it's little moments of insight; into ourselves, human nature, the world by and large. Nashville has them. So what's the problem you say? The problem is that they're buried and suffocating under the enormous weight of the rest of the movie, a barrage of country and western songs, five or ten actors crammed in every other shot, three or four people talking one over the other, a narrative slump of miniplots that criss cross in every scene.

There certainly seem to be more leading roles for men in their fifties and sixties than there are for women of the same age. There is, however, a price to be paid for this greater longevity. Modern leading men who prolong their careers into these decades tend to end up being cast in less interesting roles than younger men. Although there are exceptions, notably Clint Eastwood, it is rare to find a male star who can live up, in the second half of his career, to his achievements in the first.Michael Douglas is a case in point. In the late eighties and early nineties he was one of the most talked-about actors in Hollywood. Although there were occasional exceptions (I doubt if many people stood round the water-cooler discussing the merits of Shining Through), most of his films from Romancing the Stone in 1984 until around the time of The American President in 1995 were widely discussed topics of conversation. Many of them were discussed not merely because of their intrinsic merits but also (as in the case of Fatal Attraction, Wall Street, Basic Instinct or Falling Down) because of their controversial content. In recent years, although he has continued taking leading roles in films, he has not aroused anything like the same amount of attention; conversations about him around the water-cooler probably concentrate more on his marriage to Catherine Zeta Jones than on his films.Don't Say a Word is one of Douglas's more recent films. It is thriller of a type which dates back at least as far as Hitchcock's original The Man who Knew Too Much from the thirties but which has become very fashionable in recent years. Other recent examples include Trapped, Red Eye and Firewall. The basic premise is that the villains kidnap or make threats against a member of the hero's family in order to force the hero to assist them in some nefarious scheme. The villains usually want the hero to play some active part in their criminal enterprise rather than simply to pay a ransom (although Trapped is an exception in this respect).Douglas plays Dr Nathan Conrad, an eminent New York psychiatrist, whose young daughter Jessie is kidnapped by the villains. Their demand is an unusual one. One of Conrad's patients is a mentally disturbed young woman named Elisabeth Burrows. Locked in Elisabeth's memory is a six-digit number which, it turns out, is the key to the location of a priceless jewel. (Its precise significance does not become clear until near the end of the film). Conrad's task is to try and persuade Elisabeth to divulge this number. He has eight hours in which to accomplish this task, failing which Jessie will be killed. That is the bones of the plot, although there are a number of sub-plots; Conrad's wife Aggie, at home in bed with a broken leg, is menaced by one of the gang, Jessie struggles to free herself from her kidnappers, and a female police detective is on the trail of the villains.Don't Say a Word is not a bad film, and although there are some plot holes- it is never, for example, made clear how Elisabeth knew the location of the missing jewel, or how the villains knew that she knew- it avoids many of the other flaws which have disfigured a number of recent thrillers. It does not, for example, descend into sadistic vindictiveness in the way that Trapped does. Nor does it rely upon a succession of implausible plot twists, inserted for no good reason other than to show off the scriptwriter's cleverness. Some have complained that Famke Janssen is too young and attractive to be married to an older man like Conrad, but in fact she is four years older than Douglas's real-life wife. Douglas, in fact, plays his part well, as do most of the other actors, especially Brittany Murphy as the disturbed Elisabeth. Director Gary Fleder handles the action sequences well and develops a real sense of tension. As another reviewer has pointed out, the atmosphere of the film is close, oppressive and claustrophobic, especially in the final scenes in the Potter's Field graveyard.The problem with the film is that its central premise has been overworked. Familiarity with this sort of plot line has bred contempt, so that even when a relatively good example of this particular sub-genre comes along it can seem hackneyed. Few of Douglas's earlier films were masterpieces, but most of them were at least original enough to arouse the viewer's interest and to remain in his or her memory.

VISITOR Q depicted a family whose members indulge in the most disgusting, horrific, and depraved and don't even seem to know that what they are all doing is wrong. MONSTER was a film in which a prostitute killed her customers, not because she got a thrill out of it, but because society left her no choice. A CLOCKWORK ORANGE depicted a damaged and deranged human mind and then showed us what happens when the body that mind belongs to is no longer able to perform what the mind wants it to.

Goeth is a man who cares so little about the value of human life that he target practices with Jewish people in the Ghetto. To say that the violence in this film is unflinching isn't doing the violence enough justice. We don't watch the violent scenes as much as we full on witness it in at it's angriest and goriest. People are shot in this film. We don't see people firing a gun and then have the camera cut to people falling to the ground. We see people helplessly held at gun to the head and then shot like dogs. We see the blood shoot out very violently and graphically. We see it coat the faces of the victims and the executioners. We see many more horrific things. We see bodies blown apart, tossed aside, and broken apart. We see rotting corpses cooked and we see the remains rain from the sky. We see children get butchered and slaughtered as if their young lives were worthless and expendable. We see it all and we feel helpless. The people who do it don't see anything wrong with doing it and even make games and goofy gestures out of it. Many people will have a difficult time sitting through this film, but it remarkably watchable. As cruel and as brutal and dark and gory as it is, it is a flawless film. The film's ending makes it all worth sitting through. It remains to be one of the most moving and emotional ending in motion picture history.

The only question here is whether this movie goes beyond the merely incompetent into the realm of the gloriously incompetent. Wood, of course, set the latter standard with the gloriously incompetent Plan 9. So, does Bride measure up to Plan 9's lofty (or abysmal) precedent. In my little book, it does not; it's simply a bad movie with few redeeming qualities, glorious or otherwise.Working against this movie are the many close-ups of Lugosi's pathetically ravaged face. It's hard, for me at least, to chuckle at any of his ridiculous dialogue when the shadow of death is so clearly present. Plan 9 managed to mask the rictus until real life death mercifully took him half-way through. Here, it's like laughing at a decrepit uncle whom you knew so well in better days. Then too, there's the hulking Tor Johnson, also more pathetic than menacing. He looks in need of a chair to rest the painful bulk as he manages two or three halting steps for what was likely a very meagre payday. I guess I couldn't disregard the underlying human element so unfortunately on display in this turkey.On the other hand, there's the usual Ed Wood ear for ridiculous dialogue, including the Wood trademark-- a delirious flight of fancy as Lugosi rants himself into nothing less than world conquest. Wood's movies may have been small, but his dreams were obviously big. Then there's the centerpiece monster, a creation straight from the Goodyear Tire Co. Watching the desiccated Lugosi wrap himself in its limp arms almost amounts to suicide by rubber band. It's here, of course, that the film approaches the gloriously bad. But all this is ruined by a well-staged car wreck and some darn near competent acting from King and Dunne. I especially enjoyed watching Loretta's face disappear behind two uplifted peaks as she lay back on Lugosi's couch-- an inspired Russ Meyer camera angle. Note too, how the director worked his sweetie Dolores Fuller into the proceedings with a totally unnecessary scene. Wood may have been the world's worst film-maker, but at least he tried to keep it in the family. For me, however, Bride is simply too compromised to enjoy at the uninhibited level of a Plan 9.

He plays a B-Grade actor in the movie with in a movie Sand Pirates of the Sahara.Back to the movie and why I liked it, nay loved it.It speaks to the basic good in humanity. Jim Carrey plays a man who has no idea who he is and an entire town takes him in with open arms. They are pretty sure they know who he is, but nothing is definite. What he represents might mean more to these people than who he ultimately, truly is. A small town that has lost too many of their young men to the Second World War, the possibility that they have gotten one of their boys back gives them hope, heart, comfort, joy. He rejuvenates the whole town.This movie also speaks to the darker sides of the human spirit.It's a fearful time, especially to be anyone working in Hollywood. Jim Carrey plays a the part of a screenwriter who is wrongly accused of being a Communist, during the days of the Hollywood Blacklisting. His life as a movie man is most certainly over, he is innocent of the charges but may end up in jail- his only hope is to give an oath to tell the truth and then lie, calling others in his industry (many of whom he's never even heard of) communists. He is given a boiler plate I __ name __ so that they may have the opportunity that I have had to purge myself of my communist ways. It's a witch-hunt atmosphere where fear feeds on itself and things can only get worse.Jim Carrey is great in the movie. His character knows initially who he is, then he has amnesia, then he rediscovers who he is- only to find out that he is no longer the man he thought he was. Throughout the movie he has picked up some admirable qualities, strength, courage, conviction, wisdom, passion. Doing what Luke (the man he at one point thought he was) would do, he takes a stand against fear mongering, stands up to a very biased Congress, speaks truth, asks questions, and resolves not to let the bullies of the world take over. That's not the America people like his amnesiac doppelganger fought to defend.It's a passionate picture and you can't help but to feel impassioned as you watch it.

They are not like slick Hollywood special effects laden films, but like those lower budget masterpieces; Carnival Of Souls or the original Night Of The Living Dead. Thus the most scary villains to ever appear on screen in film may well be the semi-simian Bogeymen in the Hal Roach Studio's 1934 filmic adaptation of Glen MacDonough's and Victor Herbert's 1903 operetta Babes In Toyland, starring Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy, in what may not be their best film, in terms of pure screen comedy, but is easily their most memorable one. However, the film is not much like the original operetta, for only a few of the original songs remain. Of course, no one in this movie is killed, mutilated, raped, nor has anything worse than a clonk on the head or a dart in the ass happen to them, but this only reinforces the dream logic of the film. Thus, grown men in bad ape-like suits and phony masks are even creepier than paranormal ghouls, because they should not scare, but amuse. Yet&#133;.they scare, especially a child.How many times has a film shown someone knocked out with one punch, or a handy vase cracked over a skull, or some similarly unbelievable thing that occurs, with no logical reasoning behind it? Thus, a dissonance between the inner reality, or diegesis, of the film, and the real reality of the viewer is felt, if not cogitated upon, especially when nothing else fosters the suspension of disbelief within the movie. This does not occur in Babes In Toyland because there is no disbelief to suspend. The film, from its first frame, when Mother Goose (Virginia Karns) sings and flips pages of an over-sized book she's stepped out of, to the last frame, is wholly make believe. Thus, the Bogeymen, who come off as fifth rate Morlocks (see the 1960 version of H.G. Wells The Time Machine), are even scarier, especially to a four of five year old child- which was the age I first saw this film in its usual Thanksgiving showing, in between King Kong and Godzilla marathons&#133;.Babes In Toyland does everything a film or any work of art should do- it entertains, moves, and affects you in deeper ways than are immediately understood, even if none of this was intended. Art is not about intention, for if that were the case I guarantee you that this film would be a long forgotten period confection, not the holiday classic it is. There are Laurel and Hardy snobs (yes, they do exist!) that loathe this film, and with good reason, compared to some of their more classic Vaudevillian classics. Yet, they too are skewed, not unlike all the characters in Toyland, for they refuse to merely accept what is presented, and instead judge this terrific little film against what they feel a Laurel and Hardy film should be. Therefore it always falls short.
