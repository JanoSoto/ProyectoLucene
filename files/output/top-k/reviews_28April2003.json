I also didn't like the outcome of who was Jack the ripper, I mean through the whole movie he sounds evil and has a very deep voice but in the end we find out its a very short and very nice sounding doctor.  It did bring to life the story but it very incorrect but like i said Hollywood story.  Oh well it still is worth seeing if you are interested in the subject.

MD is visually stunning and had me in its grasp to the very end - even after the 180ยบ turn in the last third of the film. What makes a masterpiece? Undoubtedly we can say that Schindler's List and Citizen Cane are in that category. But who had to watch them repeatedly to figure out what they meant? I saw Schindler's List twice only because I wanted to experience it again. I've seen Citizen Cane about four times because it's a fantastic work of cinematic art. The majority of reviewers sat through MD more than once because they were so confused by the ending that it became a quest to decipher Lynch's story. Granted, they (and me) enjoyed the film and it was a labor of love to understand. But is that a characteristic of a masterpiece?The Sixth Sense and MD, though barely in the same category, share IMDb traits. As of April 28, 2003 The Sixth Sense scores an overall rating of 8.2 and is #72 in the top 250. MD scores an 8.0 and is ranked at #139. These are very close scores which means that, in general, they are regarded almost as equals in their viewer approval. However, The Sixth Sense is superior of the two thrillers - both being of the kind that pull a major, unexpected, even confusing plot twist near the end. Shyamalan explains the twist using flashbacks. You come out of the movie shocked and loving that fact that Shyalaman got ya. Lynch's end is so confusing and the flashbacks only make it more so. This is not just my opinion - read the other reviews. It took me two viewings of MD, hours rummaging through the IMDb message boards and several external websites before I finally found the blue key that unlocked Lynch's vision. Now that I understand his story I really like it but I don't believe that a masterpiece should have to be viewed repeatedly and broken down scene by scene to be understood.

In fact, when you get done watching you definitely want Paxton to direct again! Story is about a man who wakes his two sons up in the middle of the night to tell them that an angel visited him and has told him to kill demons that are in our society. They look like regular people but when he touches them he receives a sensation that tells him they are demons. Bill Paxton plays the father Meiks and the two sons Adam and Fenton are played by Jeremy Sumpter and Matthew O'Leary. Fenton seems to think that his father might be right but Adam does not. He thinks his father has gone insane and at one point tries to to tell the sheriff (Luke Askew) but to no avail. Meiks finally locks Adam in the cellar for days until he starts being more cooperative toward him and his mission from the angel. Film actually starts with Matthew McConaughey playing the adult Adam and its a rainy night when he walks into the office of FBI agent Wesley Doyle (Powers Boothe). Adam starts to tell him the story of his father because Doyle has been working on the case for years trying to solve the serial killings that has plagued the area for years. Film then is told mainly in flashbacks. Paxton does a great service by being faithful to the script and not allowing it to be a gore-fest. Meiks uses an ax to kill his victims but they're really is very little blood in the film. Instead, Paxton makes sure the focal point is targeted at the relationship of the two sons and how they both react differently towards their father when these events start. Paxton also makes sure the viewer cannot be sure if Meiks is correct or not. Did an angel visit him that night? At times during the film we're not sure. The films cinematographer is the great Bill Butler (Jaws) and he adds some excellent shots to this low budget film. In one scene McConaughey and Boothe are suppose to be in a car driving at night in the rain but in reality its on a sound stage. But Butler has these good shots of the wetness streaking down the window and it creates these lines that come across the characters faces in shadows. It really creates a dark and creepy mood in the film. They're is a sort of twist ending but I was not that surprised when it was played out. Its not quite The Sixth Sense but its still a little jolt! Paxton does such a good job pacing the film evenly that I was reminded of (Do I dare say it?) Hitchcock. If another director with less patience and maturity had directed this film then it would have been another splatter film. But Paxton does have the patience and maturity and the result is a film steered by someone who doesn't undermine the intelligence of the viewer.

I saw it for the first time when it came out in 69, when I was 16.  Before then, I was only marginally interested in films.  Something to while away the time.  And then I saw Satyricon.  And life has never been the same ever since.  All of a sudden I realised that film was more than simply recording images, all of a sudden it dawned on me that cinema could be art.  Now, maybe Satyricon isn't great art, but to me at that time it was overwhelming.  I'm sure other films have had this same catalytic effect on other people. Satyricon got me hooked on film, and I never looked back.  I saw the film again about 10 years ago.  I was amazed how it was still capable of exiting me.

The Devil has been portrayed thousands of times throughout the years. Every year Hollywood produces countless movies about Lucifer. Yet, there has not been a single film or book (besides Rosemary's baby ) that was good enough to be called interesting. Most of what we see about the subject is either regular horror films, that despite of their primitive premiss take themselves too seriously, or we watch action films of supernatural forces where the Devil is nothing more than a foul beast. In either case 90% of these movies are pure cliches - dumb and predictable. When I went out to see The Devil's Advocate I was expecting one of the two genres mentioned above. I got neither. What I saw was a fabulous, intelligent and amazing film, which engages both heart and mind. The first surprise was the cast, which can boast of Keanue Reeves, Charlize Therone and, in my opinion, the greatest actor of all-time Al Pacino. Only the fact that some of the most famous, and not to mention, talented actors of our time agreed to star in this film immediately draws your attention. Throughout the picture, you start realizing the unusual complexity of the story and script.Kevin Lomax (Reeves) is a success in the courtroom and out of it. He's a young Florida defense attorney who has never lost a case. No matter how repugnant the crime, no matter how guilty the defendant, Kevin Lomax has the power to mesmerize the jury into accepting his arguments, buying into his logic, being convinced by his charisma; and freeing his clients. Soon after he has successfully won the case, where he defended an obviously guilty child molester, Lomax is invited to New York, where a powerful law firm has become aware of the Florida hotshot's acquittal record. Here he meets John Milton (Al Pacino), the founder and head of Milton, Chadewick, Waters, a mysterious and powerful law firm with contacts and clients all over the world. It is this charismatic and charming man that opens the door to a completely different world; a world of luxury and pleasure, wealth and power; a world of endless possibilities. This is heaven on earth. But as Lomax tastes the power of being a wealthy New York attorney, something in him changes. Winning is no longer just a goal; it becomes an obsession. Soon he starts to realize that things are not what they seem to be; and all the things he once had and cared about -a happy marriage with Mary Ann (Charlize Theron), his relationship with his mother, all his happiness - everything disappear amidst the sparkling illusion of paradise. He suddenly realizes that Heaven and Hell can coexist..at the same place and at the same time.I do not intend to reveal anything else, since all of the interesting surprises will be presented in the intense and inspiring climax. 'The Devil's Advocate' is a story about some characteristically American values ambition, drive, materialism. Going after success and its trappings is a classic American male behavior, and Kevin Lomax shows us what can happen when that behavior gets out of hand. Winning has become such a core value in our culture that we never stop to consider the consequences of our own actions. This is a story about a man that has always been a winner and was rewarded for it with the kind of things that winning brings - wealth and power. At the end he realizes that winning may not always be the best thing, but then it is too late. The characters in this film are both complex and real, partly because of the good writing, partly because of some wonderful performances by every actor. This is probably Reeves' best performance. He manages to create a believable character - a kind of example, a role model for the American way of life. Kevin's wife, Mary Ann is most likely the hardest character to play, since she goes through a complex and difficult emotional evolution. From being strong, devoted and ambitious (a female copy of her husband) to vulnerable, hurt and on the verge of madness. Charlize Theron gracefully floats into this character. The most interesting of performances and characters is John Milton - the essence of Kevin Lomax's temptation. The invitation by a modern-day Satan to enter a world, represented by the excess of our most worldly pleasures. Al Pacino is nothing less than astonishing, an award worthy performance that is as good as anything seen this year. His power and presence is felt everywhere throughout the film, even where he is not present. This eerie and unsettling feeling is one of the elements that help creating the movie's intense and frightening atmosphere. At the same time he provides the most entertaining moments and colorful quotes. I can't imagine an audience not smiling when he screams out I am a humanist! . And the fact that Milton's law firm is involved in all the dirty business, from drugs and money laundering to murder, doesn't prevent the Devil to call himself John Milton, who is the author of the most brilliant epic about Christianity. This is entertaining by itself.As I have said previously, the major difference from the other films with diabolical themes, is the complexity of the story. The Devil is not shown as a ugly monster with red eyes. And the purpose of his existence is not to posses innocent children. One of the many interesting things in this film is the fact that the Devil is never really pulling the strings by himself -- he's giving people their choice, their free will to decide -- a demon whose world is our own, with all its mundane events. He appears in human form and presents human choices, and his greatest lure is what we have in common with him our greed, ego, jealousy, competitiveness, lust, dishonesty. Another thing is that the director is very careful to not let the monster out of the box, so to speak, by using any images that are obvious. Things appear and disappear in a moment; sometimes they seem real and sometimes they seem like a bad dream, so that when the events in the story actually do emerge into reality, the Lomaxes don't know what's real and what isn't anymore. The third element is the fabulous production design, grand art direction and rich cinematography. These elements help creating a strange and surreal world - heaven and hell almost floating into each other. Hell is here not a blackness, haunted by ghosts and monsters, but the rarified world of New York's ultra-wealthy and privileged society.After a thought provoking finale, I sat amazed by what I have seen. If you are looking for entertainment, action and ugly monsters, this is not the right answer for you, but if you are interested in a more serious and inspiring film experience, this is a spectacular and meaningful movie that is well worth your money and time.This is clearly one of the most clever and stunning works of art I've ever seen, and a pivotal film of the 90's.

This is when Pornography was going...mainstream. This is when those doing these films wanted to prove this genre was more than just sex -- that it was no different than major motion pictures and the actors actually saw themselves this way.I think if a theme like this was done by others, it would have went way off base..some Producers\/Directors trying to weed in social commentary or their beliefs -- while others just getting down and dirty in telling the tale...which would have indeed turned me off from seeing this film.Director Paul Thomas Anderson didn't go either route. He just let you decide what to make of it, all he does is show you the lives of these folks at that time when so many changes were happening to that industry, to the characters and the world around them. You learn that these actors\/actresses were regular people, real folks. They hurt, they bleed, they wanted real love and committment, and they wanted to party and be famous.Some had problems, but the idea that hookers and morally bankrupt people were all that made up this industry, you see here that's not all true. At this time, that was all being turned around.In Boogie Nights you view these characters reasons for getting involved in such an industry. The way its done is good. What happens to these characters are good to see as well, how much money and power they get, how it all goes away....all the things they get involved in...and what for? I love the transition from the 70's to the 80's when Video makes this industry grow even more mainstream. The challenges of those who do NOT want to change.Not all good things happen to these characters. Southern California -- The Valley -- is known for its adult films NOW. This shows you how all that probably started and how stars were made out of those who acted in it. It is a closed knit industry, everyone knows everyone else and from what I understand, its hard to progress from adult films to Hollywood Films\/Series but some have done so.I really like the 70's feel of the film, this is one of the only films to date that actually captures late 70's styles, clothes, hair, attitude which made it also fun to watch. The transition into the early 80's was nice too, leaving out one main event that eventually plagued the adult sex industry, but this film wasn't about that. It really stops at a certain time because it only goes through the main character's rise and fall in a very taboo industry. The casting of Burt Reynolds was smart as was sprinkling the movie with real adult film stars. Excellent performances from the leads Mark Walhberg and Julianne Moore and such memorable performances from Luis Guzman, Don Cheatle, Phillip Baker Hall, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Heather Graham, Ricky Jay, John C. Reilly, Robert Ridgley (Just wonderful!), Nicole Ari Parker, and Thomas Jane -- who looks like they just picked him up right from the 70's Male Stud Cosmopolitan Center Fold Spread and threw him in there!Boogie Nights is not for everyone, and its not for those looking to get a cheap buzz from porno-light. It's a smart film with smart acting and directing that makes it way above the pack for its theme and well worth seeing.

This is when Pornography was going...mainstream. This is when those doing these films wanted to prove this genre was more than just sex -- that it was no different than major motion pictures and the actors actually saw themselves this way.I think if a theme like this was done by others, it would have went way off base..some Producers\/Directors trying to weed in social commentary or their beliefs -- while others just getting down and dirty in telling the tale...which would have indeed turned me off from seeing this film.Director Paul Thomas Anderson didn't go either route.

My main problem is that they fail to build a real satisfying cinema experience. Yes, they are complex and try to say more than the average movie. Yes, there is a lot of good social comment to follow. Yes, I can like a movie even if the action is not in the focus of its director or script writer. The problem is that altogether, Altman's movies are - for me - hard to watch, and I get too little emotion back for the intellectual effort to watch them. And yet, 'Gosford Park' is better than the 'crowd' of Altman's films. It is set in England between the wars and it chooses as a setting a high class manor that is the scene of many classical Agatha Christie crime stories. There is even a murder to solve, though it does not seem to be in the focus of the director. What is in focus is the class relationship between masters and servants and whoever knows the British society knows that this is an important aspect of the British life until today. A multitude of superb actors, most of them British do their usual fine job, and it is always a delight to watch Maggie Smith, Helen Mirren, or Emily Watson in action.But, but... all is unfortunately lost in the never-ending verbage, in the confusing camera work which may be the delight of critics but never helps the viewer to better understand the message. The European and certainly British viewers have many BBC TV films who succeed at least as well, or even better to recreate the atmosphere and may enjoy similar (or same!) teams of fine actors.

There is some blood, but not a lot.  Rather, Carpenter seems to have used the classic techniques of Hitchcock.  One of these techniques that seems to get far too much criticism from a jaded and ignorant modern audience is the use of the expected. Carpenter often puts the shock exactly where you expect it to be and this does nothing to diminish that shock.  Rather it allows the tension to build and release like a bow string.  Consider also the use of the false shock. Carpenter again uses a favorite technique of Hitch; the build up to the obvious shock only to be let off with humor or a minor shock.  In so doing, the director creates a web of emotional connection akin to the conductor of a symphony.And speaking of symphonies, how about the use of music.  Legend has it that before Carpenter created the score for the film it was screened at the studio and was not scary.
