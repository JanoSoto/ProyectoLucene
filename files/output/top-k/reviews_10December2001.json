It's all set mainly indoors too, apart from a scene on the beach, where Ione Skye is walking & talking with the guy she has a thing for (In a big way) i forget his name right this second!!! Basically though you no the way it's gonna end up before the conclusion!!! But since it's pretty different to other Romantic Movies, it's worth a watch, but it ain't exactly fast paced either, so it takes a bit of patience!!!

They certainly don't measure up to classics like the Narnia cycle, Tolkien's books, or Madeleine L'Engle's either (A Wrinkle in Time, for instance.) Though undoubtedly clever, much of the author's cleverness is of a literary nature, which made me skeptical about how it would fare as a film. My skepticism turns out to have been well-founded. The movie is certainly faithful to the book, perhaps too much so. It could have been pared by a half hour or so and been the better for it. Chris Columbus's overuse of close-up reaction shots--Harry grinning, Harry and his friends looking at something in pop-eyed awe, Harry grinning yet again--to drive home how a scene was supposed to make the viewer feel--drove me a little mad toward the end. Subtle, this director ain't. There is, to be sure, excellent work by some fine veteran actors, such as Richard Harris, John Hurt, Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, and Robbie Coltrane. But, at the risk of being labeled a curmudgeon, I found the kids, though cute as buttons, were simply not up to their roles. Again, Columbus's constant closeups didn't serve the young actors well, and it may be regarded as unfair of me to expect kids to have the kind of inner resources to develop fully-fleshed performances. But they are expected to carry this film to a very large extent, and--well--they couldn't quite do so.

I thought it was going to be one of the best, so as soon as it came out I rented it from Blockbuster. I took it home, popped it in the DVD player, and let it go.Every five minutes or so the scene changes to follow different people. Each different scene is a different color, like, one is the real color we see, another is just shades of blue, etc. In each scene, new people are introduced all the time without saying who they are. And, some of the scenes aren't even in english!I was outraged. After I finished the movie (which was as slow as could be) I went back to Blockbuster and talked to my friend that works there. I managed to convince her to give me a refund. She said that lots of people that had rented the movie had come back 15 or 20 minutes later, demanding a refund.I highly recommend not watching this movie, it will only disappoint you.

He, along with the rest of the cast, made me forget I was watching a movie and helped draw me in to the whole swordboat fishing lifestyle.  It was fabulously done and made me appreciate Clooney's ability to come off as a real guy so much more.
