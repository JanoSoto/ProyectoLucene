For the first time you had all the greats in one movie, Eddie Murphy, Richard Pryor, Redd Foxx, Robin Harris. Especially since the last 2 have passed away and Richard Pryor is too ill to do a movie again. When he made Nights he had to sit in his wheelchair when he wasn't filming, hence you never see him do anything physical in the movie. I first saw this movie one I was 10 with my dad, uncles and my grandmother. Of course she was turned off by the profanity but we all were laughing untill our sides hurt. I also remember all the things the great voices of cinema said about this movie. And to that i say how can you look down at this movie for profanity and praise movies like Goodfellas and Pulp Fiction (great movies by the way) when they have twice the vulgar langauge. And to those that say, well why did they portray the white mobsters as the bad guys? Well its Harlem in the 30's and ask any black person who owned a place of buisness then how hard it was. To me this wasn't just about Eddie, Eddie, Eddie, this was an epic for comedy and I hate to use the clinche but Black movies as well. The only other Murphy movie that comes close is Nutty Professer. I hope the sequel to that is half as funny as Nights. One last point that I think why critics panned this movie is, we all now Eddie is a comic genuis, but people were so use to seeing him play to a white partner or sidekick (i.e. Trading Places, All the Beverly Hill Cops and 48 Hours) But to a comedy standup fan like me, Murphy, Pryor, Foxx, Hall, Harris in one movie was like giving a Star Wars fan (as I am) premire tickets to Ep. 2 & 3. If you haven't seen this I recommend it just for the fact that half the cast had passed on and this was their last work, but its also a fun take on the mobster movie craze of the 30's and 40's.

My friends and I talked for hours afterwards about the issues that Tiffany's adresses. A film has to  be pretty special to be able to do that.

This film cut so beautifully straight to my heart unlike any other film that deals with romance, except maybe Before Sunrise and, more recently, Keeping The Faith. Audrey- what can I say that hasn't already been said. The sequence where she's on the balcony singing  Moon River and the way that she looks up at George Peppard and says Hi just makes me completely melt.  The fact that this film starts off as a light comedy and develops into something a great deal more significant really touched  me, especially the way that it so beautifully expresses the way that people very much need each other in this world. Sure, the way in which Tiffany's tells it story might have a light and fairytale-like quality to it, but to me, that's part of the charm.Above all else, when I'm not involved with anyone on a romantic level, this film is what gives me hope  when I need it.

Minor complaints  Mickey Rooney's character and the line you belong to me, although that is a phenommenal speech George Peppard gives in the taxi about being scared about being put in a cage,  but not realising that you've, in fact, created one for yourself already.

We've grown accustomed to it, and The Patriot fulfills all expectations of the genre war, carnage, brief romance, and an underdog fighting against insurmoutable odds. Is it a totally realistic depiction of the Revolutionary War? I should hope not, but does it fulfill the summer requirment of being entertaining? I think so. Mel Gibson glibbly and reliably portrays the tormented hero, Heath Ledger gives voice to his eldest son(both having a relationship not unlike that between a master and his pupil as Gibson's Benjamin Martin teaches his son the likes of guerilla warfare), and Jason Issacs has the part of the deliciously wicked Colonel Tavington--commander of the redcoats. Tavington is a cliched villain, it's true, but I think that's a good thing because there is never any doubt that he is evil. In many films, the villain is often portrayed in a semi-heroic light forcing the audience to make a choice between who to root for, but like in all other summer action fair, the choice is simple evil aliens or humanity? monstrous dinosaurs or amusement park goers? genetically engineered sharks or helpless victims? One shouldn't scrutinize the story, the characters, or their actions too closely--scholastic accuracy was not the point, mindless entertainment was. It's just been moved into a new historic period is all. Truly the best thing about The Patriot is Tom Wilkinson's performance as the aristocratic General Lord Cornwallis. He alone almost makes one sorry that the British lost the war. If you're looking for a great way to spend 158 minutes, some good action, a cast of delightful actors, and some good old fun then catch The Patriot. It's worth the $8.00. And just think of what it would be like if you caught the matinee? On the otherhand, if you're looking for a history lesson, then I'd turn on the History Channel and fasten my seatbelt for a grueling ride.

I mean, you'd just HAVE to watch it, wouldn't you? Just to see how bad it was.1995's Naked Souls kept making me look for the TV Movie credit that wasn't there. A cheap and exploitative erotic thriller where Pammie exposes her left breast within the first three minutes of the movie. Anderson is an artist, specialising in plaster-casting nude women, rubbing mixture over their breasts while they proclaim it feels kinda sexy. Her boyfriend, decently played by Brian Krause, is studying brain wave patterns and accidentally crosses his own with that of a serial killer. It's all very silly and derivative, also involving a Faustian pact with a mysterious benefactor. What disturbs is that all the victims of the killer are nude women &#150; I mean, who gets into a swimming pool naked? &#150; meaning the film uses sexual violence as titillation. Dean Stockwell, in a minor role, is wasted in stuff like this.If Anderson's role in the predictable Naked Souls was peripheral (and also completely irrelevant to the plot), then Barb Wire sees her take over the screen. Released the following year, this saw the now Pamela Anderson Lee as the titular character, a Barbarella of the 90s. Of course she can't act &#150; she only manages one expression throughout the whole two hours &#150; but her assured performance is wonderful here. While it's easy to lump both these films together as trash entertainment, Barb Wire is so much more than that.

I am even more amazed at how when someone likes a movie they conveniently forgive historical revisionism (Titanic or Saving Private Ryan anyone?).  Much of the criticism against The Patriot is leveled not at the film, but at the history the film supposedly presents.  The filmmakers made it very clear to reasonable people that they had no intention of making a historical film.  They changed the main character's name to avoid confusion, they intentionally kept most real historical figures of the American Revolution at a distance.  History is not always good storytelling, but good films always are about good storytelling.  Basically, nowhere in the film itself is there any suggestion that it should be viewed as or aspires to be a history lesson of any kind.  That being said, people can debate the merits of the real actions of the real Francis Marion and the cause of the real American Revolution until they are blue in the face, but it has nothing to do with this film.  Suspension of disbelief is a big part of any filmmaking endeavor, and when a filmmaker wishes to bypass that mechanism it is pointed out to the audience (Schindler's List for example).  Yet storytelling still prevails even in the most historically accurate films as most filmmakers will attest.  The Patriot is not such a film, it is intended to entertain, not educate, and that is just fine--we need both types of films, just as much as we need people who can tell the difference.The Patriot is a truly remarkable achievement considering the last film from this producing\/directing team was Godzilla.  The film is centered and held together by Mel Gibson's performance which is certainly his best to date.  Still, much credit is due the cinematographer, director, screenwriter, and editor for being able to take melodrama to such high levels.  There are many characters here and their inner-struggles are brought out. Benjamin Marten's character is most compelling in that he is not so perfect--he makes mistakes, has regrets, and is still dealing with his temper.There is no pretense in this film--it does not reinvent the wheel, but never claims to either.  It is just a film that gives us some great characters, a compelling story, and solid delivery.  In the end (at least for those of us who leave our baggage about PC historical accuracy at the door) we are well-rewarded with a solid film that pays off more than most.
