THE LEGEND OF 1900, is one of the most beautiful and poetic movies in a very long time, (with the exception of Magnolia wich is also fantastic, but in a different style). But this one has one of the most unexpected and original stories i ever saw in a  movie. But what is realy difficult to describe is the feeling which this movie conveys. It has an atmosphere of an haunted fairy tale but in a very poetic way, turning even the most normal events into some kind of enchanted moment. The movie is directed by Giusepe Tornatore the Italian director who created one of the most beautiful movies of all time, Cinema Paradiso. Strangely enough this was one of the reasons i didn´t went to see The Legend of 1900 at the theaters. I thought that after Cinema Paradiso, there was no way, the same director would be able to create another movie like that. Man, was i wrong !I loved The Legend of 1900 so much, that i don´t know what i like best anymore. I think i only seen a story as poetic as this before and that was in Cinema Paradiso.I´m not going to talk about the plot of 1900 because you can read it in all the other reviews. What i just want to say is that this movie has just sunk Titanic even deeper, for it has all the emotion and strengh that  James Cameron never did achieve in his movie and being similar movies in atmosphere i think it´s fair to make a comparison and it´s also fair to say that THE LEGEND OF 1900, is far emotionaly superior to TITANIC in every aspect and every detail of its story. This movie is everything i was expecting to find in TITANIC and it was´t there.I wish i could do justiçe in describing how beautiful The Legend of 1900 is, but this is one of those things you have to see for yourself to really appreciate, because i guess there are no words to describe, the poetry of so many of the scenes in this movie. The moment when 1900 falls in love is truly undiscribable. The way in which music is used in this story is simply a work of genius. And this soundtrack wipes the floor with all the comercial c**p that appears nowadays in the Hollywood movies.The Legend of 1900 is to Music what Cinema Paradiso was to Cinema. Tornatore has done it again ! And as love stories go, this is one of the best i ever seen. Giuseppe Tornatore seems to have this gift to realy create extraordinary beautiful love stories without making them into  Hollywood soaps and this is very rare this days.And it´s not only the story that makes this such a good film to watch. Visualy its also trully impressive and glamorous. The production design and photography in this movie creates incredible visuals. Some scenes even look like classic paintings coming to life. And the cast is fantastic. I won´t name anyone in particular because all deliver a truly fantastic ensemble performance. Giuseppe Tornatore has created another unforgettable classic, that i can bet will be truly recognized as the mastepiece it is in years to come.Unfortunately, because it isn´t an Hollywood product, the movie didn´t had the publicity or distribution, it deserved, and so i guess not many people got the chance to see it at theaters, but hey, it´s now out on DVD and in an incredible high technical quality edition (at least in region2) so please go and rent this movie. Buy it , in fact because you won´t regret it. And if you have a widescreen tv and a surround sound, you´ll go nuts with this film.It´s movies like this that prove how fake the Oscars are.

This is also maybe one of the best character studies of any one character in cinema history. SPOILER ALERT The story tells the story of a boxer, named Jake La Motta and whose brother, Joey, played incredibly well by Joe Pesci. Soon Jake falls for Vickie, a very attractive girl and they fall in love, which in my opinion was a different kind of love for both of them. Jake was looking for someone to take care of him, but Vickie was looking for man to satisfy her need for a father figure. From there the story progresses and it shows in the most eleoquen detail the fall of a great boxer. In it it involves the mafia and its gambling, it involves love and the fall of a once-great figure in boxing, it involes portraying life in a manner of luck having to do a lot with what happens with, and the detruction of a man caught by his own paranoia of thinking his wife is cheating on him.This is maybe on the best movies of the 1980s and maybe even of all time in terms of eloquent study of the character and his downfall. The acting by De Niro and Pesci as two brothers was incredible. You could almost feel the two actually being brothers in real life. The scene where Joey comes in and is instigated by his brother to hit him on the face was incredible in that you could actually feel two little boys pestering each other. It was kind of odd in a certain way, but it reminded me of two brothers who haven't grown up.This is also in some ways a very touching stories in use of images and dialogue. The characters seem very real. Martin Scorsece was also very wise to show at the beginning of the film a very fat Jake La Motta in 1961 and then immediately switching to 1941 so as to make the audience prepare for what was to happen later so that they could keep an eye out for the touching things and events that would later prove the downfall of this boxer.This movie also contains some of the most gruesome scenes involving boxing that I have ever seen. The scenes and the close-ups of punches on boxer's faces were so grotesque and yet so realistic that you can't take your eyes of the screen. For these scenes, did it win the editing award in 1980s Oscars.This is maybe the greatest acting performance done by De Niro to date, and probably will not be topped later. De Niro had to play a realistic character with features that would make him interesting and yet sadly unlikeable. The audience almost feel that they should like him but they really can't in no way.My favorite scene was the close up of the blood stained rope as the winner was announced in a fight that Jake was in. The shot was incredible in that made the audience not actually see something and by doing that added the effect of sadness and loss that we feel for the winner. Another favorite scene was of De Niro saying to the character of Sugar Ray Robinson in his most witty way You didn't get me down which really symbolized the life of Jake, being that it doesn't matter how much you suffer, just as long as you win in the wrong run.This is a sad story and I haven't even scratched the surface while telling yout the plot. A lot more happens later, with the Chracter gaining on 50 pounds and finally snapping and beating up his brother for his suspicion of sleeping with his wife.The story ends on a somber note with Jake kicking his head against the prison walls screaming... Why? Why? Why?This is a movie that is strong and thoughtful. This is not a movie for popcorn or entertainment value. This is an indepth study of a character and his life. It's sad and not gentle.

This movie has the right look and feel to it.  The hotel that serves as the setting fits wonderfully, and several of the creepy scenes work to full effect. (Interestingly enough, the most chilling scene in the entire movie- the famous 'All Work and No Play...' one- wasn't even in the book!)  So, in that limited way, the movie works.Now the bad Where are these characters?  Where is there ANY development?? You have Hallorann By the end of the movie you have to wonder why the even chose to put him in it at all.  Danny doesn't do anything in the entire movie but mumble a bit.  Wendy All she does is cry and sob.  Very annoying. Not that it was her fault.  That's all she was given to do.  Jack This guy is supposed to DESCEND into the madness of the hotel.  He is supposed to be flawed at the beginning of the story, but still be a *good* human being. In this movie, he's very harsh with his family from the start, and we never see him really interact with them before he starts to go off the deep end, so to speak. (Not that there was a chance.  Seemingly, the second he steps in the hotel he's halfway to the end of the movie)The line reading was just that.  READING.  So much of the movie seems forced... contrived...  And though there are nice efforts to alter parts of the novel to facilitate the different medium (such as the doctor scene at the beginning of the movie, which culls elements and plot points from the whole book in mere minutes) there are too many complete changes that don't make much sense. (why the hedge maze?  Why end it like *that*??  I think I know why Kubrick didn't use the same ending\/main plot point from the book, but still... could have done better)  Not to mention huge themes and elements from the novel that you would think should have been present.I likely need to watch this movie again in awhile after the book isn't so fresh in my mind, and perhaps I can look at it more as a separate movie and not a movie based on the book.  As it is, I found it it to be very un-affecting for the most part, except for about half on hour towards the end.For now, I give it 5.5 out of 10, based on artistic merit, that half hour, and the best scene that seems like it should have been in the book even though it wasn't.

And though there are nice efforts to alter parts of the novel to facilitate the different medium (such as the doctor scene at the beginning of the movie, which culls elements and plot points from the whole book in mere minutes) there are too many complete changes that don't make much sense.

I think I know why Kubrick didn't use the same ending\/main plot point from the book, but still... could have done better)  Not to mention huge themes and elements from the novel that you would think should have been present.I likely need to watch this movie again in awhile after the book isn't so fresh in my mind, and perhaps I can look at it more as a separate movie and not a movie based on the book.  As it is, I found it it to be very un-affecting for the most part, except for about half on hour towards the end.For now, I give it 5.5 out of 10, based on artistic merit, that half hour, and the best scene that seems like it should have been in the book even though it wasn't.

Through the burning desert, Bruce Surtees' lens discovers a lone horseman.... The camera pans with the horseman to reveal a small town by a lake-lagoon... The horseman rides in, the camera tracking behind him, interrupted with faces of suspicious locals - even a coffin maker with his merchandises - and instantly one is reminded of Sergio Leone and his faithful reproduction of Kurosawa... A coach driver cracks the whip... The horseman turns, and moves back... He enters a bar and asks for 'a beer and a bottle.' A town heavy intervenes 'Flea-bitten range-bums don't usually stop in Lago. Life here is a little too quick for them. Maybe you think you're fast enough to keep up with us!' The drifter replies 'I'm faster than you'll ever live to be!'True to his promise, the Stranger kills the 'trouble shooter' and his two friends, and also rapes the town belle who responds as any Eastwood feminine victim is obliged to, with resistance turning strangely to joy... The town midget, Mordecai (Billy Curtis) offers him a cigar inquiring 'What did you say your name was again?' The hardened Stranger replies 'I didn't!'The Man With No Name has returned, this time, quite literally, with a vengeance... His dictatorship is flavored with cool humor... The name Billy Borders is mentioned to him...'Don't know the man,' he confesses.'You didn't have much time to,' comes the reply, 'because you shot him yesterday.'When his rape victim, Callie Travers (Mariana Hill) inaccurately empties a pistol at him during his bath, he casually resurfaces, cigar still in his mouth, and in an aside to his sidekick, Mordecai, reflects 'I wonder what took her so long to get mad?' His fellow chauvinist suggests, 'Maybe because you didn't come back for more.'The townsfolk accedes to the Stranger's requests, who pushes them to the limit, even forcing them to paint the entire town blood red... 'When we get down,' says one of them, 'this place is going to look like hell.'This is the Stranger's intention; he takes a brush and strokes out the name 'Logo' on the town sign and writes 'Hell' instead.In a series of flashbacks, primarily from the Stranger's point of view and later from Mordecai's, it is revealed that the townsfolk stood by and let three men whip their Marshal to death... The Marshal had discovered that the basis of the town's prosperity, a mine, was actually on government land and not on the townspeople's own. He was going to report this, so no-one felt obliged to intervene when he met his vicious end... His body now was lying outside the town in an unmarked grave 'They say the dead don't rest without a marker of some kind... he's the reason this town's afraid of strangers.'Now they have reason to be afraid of the three men who paid the price for the crime in which they all agreed... The Stranger analyzes this fear 'It's what people know about themselves inside that makes them afraid.' The town reaction to his is reserved... A group of vigilantes try to kill him... The Stranger repays them with a stick of dynamite... Despite their training, the remaining locals are horrified when they realize that he does not intend to remain for the final showdown...High Plains Drifter is one of the most important Westerns ever made, and when Eastwood takes his rightful place in film history alongside Cooper and Stewart and Wayne, this is the film that will be seen as the quintessential example of his art...

In the English original, Caine gives an excellent performance of a London villain tracking down his brother's killers in the north of England (Newcastle). He plays Carter as a menacing but well spoken and confident character.Stallone unfortunately couldn't act his way out of a wet paper bag. Those who think his acting in the dreadfully boring 'Copland' was great, obviously believe that the ability to put on 50lbs and occasionally move your lips while mumbling incoherently, makes you a good actor. Wrong. To quote Dennis Pennis, 'He was so wooden, I thought someone had thrown a chair onto the screen'.Not only that, but did they raid Don Johnson's old Miami Vice wardrobe for Stallone's suits?The ending is also a typical Hollywood cop-out. Watch this movie, then watch the original to find out how a film should be made and how it should be ended.Still, in its favour the film does have the ever gorgeous Rachel Leigh Cook. Its not much, I know, but its a start.Overall I would call this film sacreligous. What next, are they going to to do a remake of another British classic 'The Long Good Friday' and have Adam Sandler playing Bob Hoskins' character, Harold Shand !!!

Well, this film is different, in that it was directed by the single greatest director of all times, Alfred Hitchcock. The Birds was made during his peak. It follows on the heels of such films as Rear Window, Vertigo, North by Northwest and Psycho. It is as well directed as those films. In fact, it is even more daring than those. Several classical Hollywood elements are missing from this film. For one thing, and perhaps the most effective choice made by Hitchcock for this film, there is no musical score. Even in his best films, Psycho and Vertigo, for instance, the films are swept along by the score. They are great scores, by maybe the best score composer who ever worked in the movies, Bernard Herrmann, but to see a Hitchcock film without a score is just fantastic. Even the best musical scores are meant to manipulate your emotions, so here we get a chance to see just how effective a film can be without one. Also, the end of this film is perhaps the most unconventional you're ever going to see (although Vertigo also has a very unconventional ending). It is possibly the most startling image I've ever seen. Even if it just had Hitchcock's amazing direction going for it, The Birds also benefits from an absolutely masterful script. It is never as if the story is just that birds attack people. It is much, much more complex than that. And herein lies my Freudian Analysis. Of course, coming right after Psycho, Hitch was probably jumping to keep the whole Oedipus theme alive here. Annie, the school teacher, expresses this literally. But I would like to interpret the birds as more of a symbol than actual matter. Think back to the film Forbidden Planet. Remember the Monster of the Id, the invisible and immaterial beast who destroyed every person who attempted to take Dr. Morbius and his daughter off the planet, basically whoever threatened to steal his daughter from him? I think the birds in The Birds serve the same function for Lydia. When Melanie Daniels, a supposed sexual predator, enters the small, peaceful town of Bodega Bay, she does so to prey on Mitch Brenner. We find out, just as much by her actions as by Annie's speech, that Lydia is very jealous of her son's women. Melanie is also introducing her carnality onto the town as a whole. She brings the love birds for Cathy. Mitch had at first asked that the love birds not be too willing to display their love, and the first thing that Cathy asks is, How can I tell which one is male and which one is female? Notice also that the mother in the restaurant attacks her for being responsible. This ought to seem ridiculous, but it seems perfectly logical in the text of this film. The woman says, I think you're responsible. Who are you? WHAT are you? At the end of the film, Lydia does seem to accept Melanie. The birds are still there, but they do not harm them as they leave. Too often this film gets shoved into the horror genre and left there. I believe it was Hitchcock's most successful film, and for some reason, I think that more people could identify it and identify it as a Hitchcock film than any of his other films except for maybe Psycho. The Birds, and Psycho, too, which is also often classified as a horror film (which it is not in any way) are far too complex to be labeled with such a small label. They are both masterpieces. Psycho has always been regarded as one. The Birds is sometimes, but not as often. It is certainly one of Hitchcock's best. This man was a god. The Birds is a godly film. 10\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"21 November 2000","score":"5 out of 9 people found the following review useful","review":"  One would think, not having seen this film, that it is just a normal horror film where a mass of animals attacks people who run from them and scream.
