[{"date":"12 March 2012","score":"2 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" Magnolia is indeed quite a film, it has all the tears, joy, pain, suffering, compunction, regret, fear, and trouble, and pressure, dejection that a melodrama usually does and still does not lose its grip and become a superficial sob saga. It careens through every emotion above and even more, narrating the lives of many characters intertwining within 24 hours and causing twists in their lives and miracles in the weather. The film also uses a lot of close-ups and background music to support the emotions , the most defining song being the street rap sung by the kid which defines the entire film. And everything is said within three hours, keeping a religious reference in the picture too (the director-writer Paul Thomas Anderson, maker of the superb There will be Blood wasn't apparently aware when about the bible reference when he wrote the film). Magnolia can be a tour de force novel, and it's almost a miracle that has made it a great film, since people nowadays don't favor overload of emotions.Magnolia tells about many lives crossing paths in a single day, leading to newfound relations between them and a few tragedies too. Like Ebert said, there are too many stories to contain in a single review but the major ones are those of Cruise's, Melora's, and Flynn's. Cruise's Frank Mackey has a strained relationship with his father and now is a successful, cocky, arrogant sex adviser who gets grilled in an interview leading to certain events. Jason Robart's Earl is bedridden and shares his desires to meet his son. Julianne's Jane is a virulent and temperamental lady who actually behaves like that because of the guilt welling in her. Macy's Donnie is a gay man who was a child prodigy and had won a contest but now struggles to make a living. There are many others which I won't mention here but all of them go through changes and this tests their hardened exterior, making many break down and confess their sins, guilt, fears and sorrows. Everything moves like a game show, with an accelerated start, a slowdown with a breakdown, then getting back to an accelerated finish.The story is startlingly honest and endearing; if only George Scott could see beyond the profanity&#x85; Almost all the stories strike the right chord and it is only at certain moments the drama goes overboard, for example, Stanley breaking down on national TV. Personally, I felt that maybe if the Jim's story had been trimmer or if they had done away with or truncated either Donnie Smith's or Neil Flynn's story it would've had more impact but again, without these stories the film may be incomplete. But I do think the three hour and eight minute duration was quite long, and at times the message became convoluted since so many story lines were to be followed. But the more important thing was that these stories touched me in one way or the other and had a collaborative impact on me in the end, and after a day of watching the film, the impact of the film and my respect for Paul Tomas Anderson's vision deepened.All the actors support and never upstage the film, something that happens when great actors are cast. The music is terrific, and when everyone actually sings a song that's playing on the radio, I was reminded of the 'Fort Minor' music video, the group that sang that rap song whose name I don't recollect. The frog scene was in tune with the film since there have been such weird incidents, but fewer frogs, please. Mulholland Drive is similar to Magnolia except that the former is more surrealistic, but having seen both the films, I can say that Mulholland is more concise and made with a very clear and impactful, singular vision, while Magnolia is more swelling in its plot, with multiple themes and a more heartfelt ending. Out of the two, Mulholland is a better film but Magnolia is something that is more accessible to the audience in general. Thomas Anderson's approach here is similar to the great Leo Tolstoy's, both have many journeys running parallel each with their own redemption.Do not be put off by the run length mentioned behind the DVD case or the poster that looks gooey and maudlin or the amount of profanity in the film like George C Scott was or even the title 'Magnolia' that may seem weird or too artsy to some. Take your seat and experience this wonderful ride, you will surely not be disappointed.My Rating 8.4 out of 10 ","genre":null},{"date":"12 March 2012","score":"2 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" Magnolia is indeed quite a film, it has all the tears, joy, pain, suffering, compunction, regret, fear, and trouble, and pressure, dejection that a melodrama usually does and still does not lose its grip and become a superficial sob saga.
