Lots of time, and nothing to do. you might feel pressured in by tasks and responsibilities. Jobs, school, family, children, or other obligations\/duties. You might feel like you want to escape, even if for a little bit. Even if for just 2 hours. So you head over to the theater. You can catch a 2 hour flick and for those 2 hours, take your mind off the day's and the next day's demands. It can be quite adventurous, if you're seeking that. Or even emotionally gratifying. Truth is, films, and other entertainment, offer escapism. And the producers and creators of these films know this. So, why watch a movie about imprisonment? You might find the subject interesting, if you're keeping in mind that you will most likely never go to prison. So why not watch from the outside, from the other side of the glass mirror. You're safe there, and the film on screen cannot hurt you. The villains or dangers on screen cannot attack you, let alone even perceive you. But the opposite is true. The creators of the films know you are there. You are the reason why the film exists. And they aim to affect you. They sometimes even aim to attack you. And they definitely can. Have you ever watched a movie that spoke to you, made you feel something, maybe even made you cry? How could you cry over nonexistent people? How can these nonexistent people affect you? It's because films are a reflection of the world. This reflection, although often exaggerated (sometimes super exaggerated), strike a chord in you. And the music, or the movie, stays in your head. And in your heart.So, once again, why watch a movie about imprisonment? Why would you escape to a place where people want to escape from? You're going into it with the assumption that at the end, the villain is defeated (the villain being the prison), and the characters, which you've somehow come to relate to and care about in the brief hour or two that you've known them, triumph over the villain and escape danger. And admittedly, as exaggerated as that is, you need it. A person does not suffer for no reason. One does not fall to stay down. And besides, who's to say that life inside is not life at all?The Shawshank Redemption is a human tale. It is one of the most down to earth films I've ever seen. Human emotion, thought and spirit is painted onto the screen, while succeeding at using the medium of film for storytelling, resulting in a powerful and well composed movie. The human heart is exposed as a fragile, yet firm organ which endures pain, and even worse, sorrow. It is a pillar of integrity that continues to beat even when the spirit of the person is broken, and hope itself has been lost and forgotten about. However, while the story, pacing and performances will draw you in and not let you go with its stroke of humanity, the film also displays the human being at its worst. Complete disregard for the well being of others, lack of forgiveness and greed are personalities and behaviors that are exhibited in the film. The truth is, mankind is not fit for self judgment. This is exhibited by errors in trial and the need for juries and witnesses. However, it is also fact that the men serving life sentences, although some committed errors whilst in a certain drunken state of mind, are insane.Although there are many faces in The Shawshank Redemption, and some come as far as to redeem themselves a little bit from time to time, there is one character that is static throughout all the film the prison. It is arguably the best character, giving the best performance as well. There are several shots in the film that display the prison, that are the best shots in the film. This is the core of the film. This is where the atmosphere and tone of the film shine through, albeit gloomy. I just wish that there were more shots of the prison throughout the film. But it is not the main character of the film. While it is a character that speaks to the audience, it is not a relatable character.The Shawshank Redemption is a fine, fine film. It unveils the human heart, and all the wonders and beauties that it is capable of. It also manages to show off the polarity of the human heart. How men are capable of not just ending life, but installing factors like misery, sorrow, and hopelessness in others. Why do we feel trapped at times? Who's keeping you in, and what are they keeping you from? The Shawshank Redemption is a film that will imprison you, and not let you go until it has affected you. And when it finally has affected you, it will set you free. Blue skies, green grass and white clouds are what surrounds us every day. Sometimes we spend too much time in the hole, and forget what life is like out there. You may even get used to it, and find yourself feeling like you can't survive on the outside. You may find yourself living in fear out there. But the truth is, you can build brick walls around a man, impose limitations to his actions and goals, but a man is only trapped on the inside. And just like our character Andy Dufresne, we had to come to prison to become a crook. So, get busy living, or get busy dying. And get busy watching The Shawshank Redemption.

Many reviews defend this version by saying that it is a family film. In fact it is probably less tame than the novel. For instance, Cardinal Richelieu is always (hilariously) looking down the shirt of every woman he comes into contact with, including Queen Anne of Austria. At one point, he actually tries to grab the breasts (!!!) of Milady deWinter, but she stops him with a dagger. No mention is made of D'Artagnan's adultery with Constance Bonacieux; however, towards the beginning, priest Aramis is about to commit adultery with a bombshell whom he is coaching in theology!!! There's plenty of death (albeit without blood) and even a bit of torture. So you see, this isn't really a family film, so why not stay true to the original plot? Perhaps, if the intention is to lower the IQs of movie-going families, the filmmakers have succeeded.That's not to say that the movie has no saving graces, which is why I gave it a 3, not a zero. There are actually plenty of witty lines, but that's all this movie has going for it, besides the inadvertent humor. Most of the funny lines revolve around sex, like when Milady tells Richelieu, I don't think you're burdened by chastity.Now let's talk about funny things that make this movie so bad. D'Artagnan's name is laughably pronounced in an American accent, Dartanian. Chris O'Donnell interprets the role of D'Artagnan as an imbecile. He lands himself in prison for confronting a bunch of the Cardinal's guards alone, and then he threatens his captor (Captain Rochefort) during interrogation. It's a miracle he didn't get killed right then and there. D'Artagnan is supposed to be boorish but smart, not a numbskull. Much of O'Donnell's acting is absolutely wooden!The Cardinal has this goofy goatee that makes him look ridiculous when he smiles. His plan is to make a secret alliance with the Duke of Buckingham who is going to invade France, and then make himself KING OF France!!! Why this complete reversal of the plot into something completely unrealistic and stupid? Anyway, I could go on and on. I think even as a kid I thought this movie was stupid. Any kid could benefit more from seeing the Richard Lester version or, better yet, reading the book! To sum it up, this movie would probably make Dumas roll around in his grave.

For God's sake, let me just elect Andy at random first and write about the others next time. I think that the attraction for Andy mainly comes from the diversity between his exterior and interior. I have got to tell you that just Andy's appearance can merely teach me a lesson, reminding me of a saying, never judge a book by its cover.  I cannot describe it better than those who have met Andy, so let me quote some words from them：1. My wife used to say I'm a hard man to know. Like a closed book. - Stated by Andy, himselfYou strike me as a particularly icy and remorseless man, Mr. Dufresne. It chills my blood just to look at you. -- Cited from the Judge who sentenced AndyTommy What's he in here for anyway? Red Murder. Tommy The hell, you say. Red You wouldn't think it to look at the guy. -- Cited from the conversation between Tommy and Red (Red had contacted with Andy more than 30 years when he said that )The above quotes may show that Andy is a fierce , cruel man in the external appearance. While he is warm-hearted and even be ready to help out. Andy made the government to expend the library to educate far more prisoners. Besides he even help a couple of fellas to get their high school equivalency. 2. I admit I didn't think much of Andy first time I laid eyes on him. Looked like a stiff breeze would blow him over. That was my first impression of the man. --cited from RedAccording to Red's comment, Andy looks weak, while you can find out that he is pretty brave. In the prison, Andy had been targeted by a group of homosexual guys called The Sisters. nevertheless Andy never gave in to them, even though he was beaten to dead by The Sisters.3. Andy is an extremely intelligent person, who is a banker and educated man. He always know the way to survive. In the person, one cannot live on his own, he has to gang up with others. He bought the gang beers and get accustomed to the custom of prison. Andy get along with the guards even the warden as well by helping them to earn extra money by finding the tax-deductible part.4. He had a quiet way about him...a walk and a talk that just wasn't normal around here. He strolled...like a man in the park without a care or a worry in the world. Like he had on an invisible coat that would shield him from this place. -- Cited from RedAndy is always in a clam mood and plans things to accomplish with a very rational and organized way. Although Andy is flesh and blood, he is still patience and can tolerate everything regardless of all the abuse and bully. He spent 20 whole years for his prison-break with no single shred of sign or evidence.5.Andy is the type of person who appreciates help and gives his brutal revenge to the bad and evil. Tit for tat is a great conclusion to his personality. He exploded the bribery and even murder crime that the warden had committed, a doomsday to the evil once and for all.Considering all the points above, that is why I appreciate the character Andy.

","genre":"Crime, Drama"},{"date":"3 March 2010","score":"","review":" ****Contains spoiler****I love the movie because it portrays great characters!As to my favorite character, Since all the characters in this movie are so unique and vivid, especially Red and Andy, I had been in a tough time to pick out my most favorite one. For God's sake, let me just elect Andy at random first and write about the others next time. I think that the attraction for Andy mainly comes from the diversity between his exterior and interior. I have got to tell you that just Andy's appearance can merely teach me a lesson, reminding me of a saying, never judge a book by its cover.  I cannot describe it better than those who have met Andy, so let me quote some words from them：1. My wife used to say I'm a hard man to know. Like a closed book. - Stated by Andy, himselfYou strike me as a particularly icy and remorseless man, Mr. Dufresne. It chills my blood just to look at you. -- Cited from the Judge who sentenced AndyTommy What's he in here for anyway? Red Murder. Tommy The hell, you say. Red You wouldn't think it to look at the guy. -- Cited from the conversation between Tommy and Red (Red had contacted with Andy more than 30 years when he said that )The above quotes may show that Andy is a fierce , cruel man in the external appearance. While he is warm-hearted and even be ready to help out. Andy made the government to expend the library to educate far more prisoners. Besides he even help a couple of fellas to get their high school equivalency. 2. I admit I didn't think much of Andy first time I laid eyes on him. Looked like a stiff breeze would blow him over. That was my first impression of the man. --cited from RedAccording to Red's comment, Andy looks weak, while you can find out that he is pretty brave. In the prison, Andy had been targeted by a group of homosexual guys called The Sisters. nevertheless Andy never gave in to them, even though he was beaten to dead by The Sisters.3. Andy is an extremely intelligent person, who is a banker and educated man. He always know the way to survive. In the person, one cannot live on his own, he has to gang up with others. He bought the gang beers and get accustomed to the custom of prison. Andy get along with the guards even the warden as well by helping them to earn extra money by finding the tax-deductible part.4. He had a quiet way about him...a walk and a talk that just wasn't normal around here. He strolled...like a man in the park without a care or a worry in the world. Like he had on an invisible coat that would shield him from this place. -- Cited from RedAndy is always in a clam mood and plans things to accomplish with a very rational and organized way. Although Andy is flesh and blood, he is still patience and can tolerate everything regardless of all the abuse and bully. He spent 20 whole years for his prison-break with no single shred of sign or evidence.5.Andy is the type of person who appreciates help and gives his brutal revenge to the bad and evil. Tit for tat is a great conclusion to his personality. He exploded the bribery and even murder crime that the warden had committed, a doomsday to the evil once and for all.Considering all the points above, that is why I appreciate the character Andy.

In it, Edward G. Robinson plays a hen-pecked middle-aged husband who strikes up a would-be relationship with a younger woman of questionable moral fibre. Little does he know, her actual lover has persuaded her to milk him for all he's worth.You might find that the above description sounds a bit clichéd and I'd be inclined to agree. About the first hour of the film proceeds in predictable fashion before the story really comes into its own. The plot does eventually justify your attention but the routine proceedings of the film's first half are arguably its biggest drawback.The cast is decent but not outstanding. Edward G. Robinson gives the best performance by far. It's hard to believe that he was never even nominated for an Oscar over his long career. I have less patience for Joan Bennett & Dan Duryea, though that's mainly because their characters are basically one dimensional.Lang's direction is attractive while the H.J. Salter score and Milton Krasner cinematography combine to give the film the atmosphere that it requires. The adapted screenplay from Dudley Nichols also delivers the goods in the long run.Had the film not started out so ordinarily I would have ranked it higher but, even though the latter portion of the film is eminently satisfying, I can't ignore what preceded it. Nevertheless, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend the film despite my caveat regarding the film's relatively uninteresting early stages.By the way, this film is in the public domain, meaning that any distributor can sell copies without licensing the material. As a result, poor quality versions of the film abound on home video. As far as I know, the best presentation available is the Kino DVD edition, which is mastered from material preserved by the Library of Congress.

Well anyway this guy is trying his best not to get involved with the war. Unfortunately, his eldest son joins the rebels and soon after he is being arrested and Gibson's second oldest son is killed while trying to get to his older brother. Well this sets a light under Gibson's character and you find out he was a rather super killer during his younger days fighting battles. He soon enlists the aid of others and they begin fighting the redcoats using tactics not seen during this era. Basically, instead of standing there taking shots at each other they ambush their enemy from hiding spots. The movie has a sad scene later, and ends on a rather more positive note after a fierce battle and great final line between Gibson and the villain of the piece. The movie works on a lot of levels, could use maybe a trim down on the run time of the film and perhaps a tad less tragedy and it could have been really great.

They really had fun with this one and didn't take themselves too seriously. And it was actually funny!The movie picks up where the second one ended, but I don't think you necessarily need to see the first two movies to enjoy this one. There are plenty of flashbacks and, frankly, it's a pretty crazy story to follow in any case. I think this one actually made more sense than the first two.The first Phantasm was an amateur pet project that was literally a bunch of friends working weekends putting together a horror movie for fun. It was and is a cult hit.The second movie had more money behind it but, in my opinion, tried to take itself a little too seriously for such ridiculous subject matter.For me, this movie had the perfect balance of horror and comedy. It was hilarious, horrific, and sometimes both at the same time. Good fun with decent make-up effects and an amazing car stunt with a hearse. I also really liked the way they introduced one of the main characters, the kid. I could see that idea being a great movie on its own Home Alone done as a horror movie.In the DVD commentary (yes, believe it or not, I even listened to the commentary) Baldwin asked Angus what the fan reaction to this movie was. He said that people either hated it for the comedy element or loved it because of it.

It simply couldn't be done.Elizabeth Taylor gives one of her best (if not finest) performances of her career as Leslie. She is feisty yet likable; the kind of person you would want to have as a friend. Her warmth eclipsed her youthful beauty until even Vashti, whose dream of marrying Bic Benedict was dashed to pieces, could not help but like her. What Taylor gives us in Giant is a timeless lesson Physical beauty fades with age but if there is substance and depth to a person's inner core, beauty remains.Favorite parts The camera panning away from Taylor as she and Hudson stand by the fence of her Maryland home........never did she or would she be more beautiful as in that moment. Not even as Cleopatra.The Thanksgiving scene where the children are crying at the dinner table and on the stairs. Priceless. Just about every child in this film acted so naturally it brought a sense of normalcy to what could have easily gone in a very theatrical direction.The moving scene when Angel Obregon comes home from the war. I could watch this film a hundred times and I would still tear up when Bic hands the Texas flag to Old Paolo.The pool scene where the faces of Taylor and Hudson speak volumes although the noise of the party is so loud it drowns out the announcement of their son's marriage to the beautiful but dark-skinned Juana. A Not in my backyard moment which was a prevalent feeling in Texas at that time.The scene when Vashti enters the room and says Howdy, everybody!. Again, we see her character age and are still entranced by her. She wasn't a beauty but she was a loyal friend and the life of the party. Equally entertaining was Uncle Bawley rounding the guests up and herding them out like cattle. Priceless! Watching the expressions on face of the actress who played Juana is like watching the birth of the civil rights movement. We see anger flicker across her face as she realizes the hairdressers in the salon have snubbed her. We see real pain in her eyes at Sarge's diner when Bic is speaking with Sarge and he refers to her baby (Bic's grandson) as that there papoose over there. She's felt the sting of racism before and it hurts.The scene in Sarge's diner has to be a classic, up there with one of the best fight scenes of all time. Sarge wins....but does he really? Not in the eyes of the Benedict women. In that moment Bic becomes a real hero. He has had a paradigm shift in thinking regarding his own deep-seated racial prejudice because in his own household, Mexican blood has now become part of the Benedict lineage. He has stopped seeing Mexicans as those people and started seeing them as real people. It is a shift in thinking that represents something that was starting to happen all across the country and would continue to do so as the 60's and Civil Rights grew stronger.This epic film will captivate you and leave you breathless.

Except for one thing that would have helped immensely. Is it the visuals you ask? No, the visuals look great even for a movie made back in 1982. It captures a futuristic city so well, a dark and grimy place with technology in areas to give it a certain color scheme. It is almost a live action anime when one looks at other films such as Akira. Is it the acting you ask? No, the acting could not be better, Harrison Ford playing the lead, a man who hunts down rouge androids and Rutger Hauer is always excellent if you ask me. No one does a better job if he had a more typical Hollywood look he would have been the lead in a lot more mainstream fare. And Sean Young and Daryl Hannah look absolutely great, with Daryl looking rather hot. So is it the story? Not entirely. The story has very good elements in it and there is something there. So what is it you ask? Well I know I am going to get hammered for voicing this opinion, but keep in mind it is an opinion...the main thing I had a problem with is the lack of action. I know story and such are important and yes there are lots of movies with no action I like, but this movie was about a man hunting down dangerous androids. This alone should entail that there is going to be a lot more action in the movie than there ended up being. Though the ending was excellent and everything else in this movie was superbly done, I needed some more shoot outs, more blood, and more death. At times the pacing in the movie had me a tad bored, and while it was still nice to look at and it was nice to see the actors have some good dialog, I always kept wanting more adrenaline type action. So there I said it, and I sort of regret it as this is probably one of those movies that people will not take to kindly anything negative said about it. Overall though it was a fine movie and entertaining. I loved Ford as the hunter like I said and I always enjoy Hauer. It amazes me this movie did not do better at the box office than it did. Just the visual style of it had to be something to marvel at back in 1982. So a rather good movie that could have been nearly perfect with a bit more action.

Surrounded by around 2000 North Vietnamese soldiers who were well trained and well versed with the terrain, Moore's troopers fought for 56 hours. It was a bloody and brutal battle that was the first major engagement of the Vietnam War. It was The Valley Of Death in more ways than one.Directed by Randall Wallace, We Were Soldiers is based on the book We Were Soldiers Once&#x85; And Young by Moore and reporter Joseph L. Galloway. As always when a War film comes out you get the usual statements trundled out. Things such as the most realistic yet and finally a film to tell it as it was, both of which were applied to Wallace's movie. If they happen to be true I have no idea, what with not being a combat veteran myself. What I do know is that personally, We Were Soldiers hits many many high points in its running time of 138 minutes.After a crucial 30 minute build up of the characters, the film switches to the landing of the boys in Vietnam. From here the action never lets up, with Wallace and his team stunningly recreating the brutality and harshness of this bloody engagement. But crucially the action does not detract from its characters, having been engaged with them at the start of the film, the makers ensure that we stay with these men throughout the battle. Also of note is that the film shows the Vietnamese side of the battle, the fair treatment of both sides a most rewarding thing to see in a War film. There's brilliant cut aways to the Women and families at home, themselves fighting a battle to not lose their minds as their men fight in some faraway land. The emotional aspect significantly racked up high as the dreaded telegrams start being delivered by nameless, faceless yellow cab drivers.The men of the cast are uniformly strong, particularly Gibson, Sam Elliott, Greg Kinnear, Barry Pepper & Ryan Hurst. While Madeleine Stowe & Keri Russell deliver heartfelt and believable turns on the Women's side. Dean Semler's cinematography is done justice by the new High Definition age and Nick Glennie-Smith's score is just a wonderful, emotive arrangement that taps into the psyche of the viewer. It's looking like it is a divisive film now, certainly in the context of Vietnam War films. So with that it is in danger of becoming the forgotten Nam movie.

My husband had switched the channel and landed on the slave galley scene from Ben-Hur. The sounds of the drum beating as slaves rowed, was instantly recognizable. I immediately told my husband to press record on our DVR to capture the remainder of this epic show. From that moment, I was unable to tear myself away and proceeded to watch the story unfold as the rest of my household went to bed. I sat rapt and weeping yet again over this glorious movie. I remember watching this movie in a movie theater in 1959 with my family when it first came out. I was 3 or 4 years old. I recall that during the extremely intense chariot race I had to cover my eyes and asked my mother to tell me when the scene was over and to tell me if the good guys won! That scene, so intense for me then, still caused me to exclaim in trepidation, even now at age 54. Thinking back, I have identified with this movie each of the three times I have watched it. As a child then, my thoughts were about the cruelty of some, the integrity of others and the wonders of this Christ they spoke about. I remember thinking that I hoped I would grow up and have a brother so heroic that he would come and save me like Juda Ben-Hur did when he came back for his sister and mother and carried them out of the Lepers' colony, and also that there would still be men like Christ for my generation. Later on, in my early twenties, I watched this movie again. I remember wishing then that I could meet a man so honorable and heroic (like Juda) who, if in similar circumstances, would come back and save his family and marry me! Now as an adult and mother to a son and daughter, I wept yet again during my viewing (!) and wondered if my family was in similar circumstances, might my son be so strong and heroic that he could survive such cruelties and still feel such love and devotion that he would be able to come back to save his mother and his younger sister?

Now as an adult and mother to a son and daughter, I wept yet again during my viewing (!) and wondered if my family was in similar circumstances, might my son be so strong and heroic that he could survive such cruelties and still feel such love and devotion that he would be able to come back to save his mother and his younger sister? How the years pass. The movie was and still is fantastic and deserves all the accolades it has received.

What a mistake! This movie is deeply, deeply flawed, both as science fiction and as a matter of film-making. It suffers from many of the worst clichés of 1980s American films, and displays none of the sense of atmosphere, imagination and style which are present in Cameron's best work. I find it almost unbelievable that he followed the amazing Aliens with this movie.So what are the problems? First, the plot. It is clichéd, silly, and resolves with a laughable deus ex machina. Like many a poor action\/sci-fi movie, it relies almost entirely on coincidence and contrivance to develop the story, rather than being driven by strong characters with believable motivations. For example, we are presented with a series of pathetically derivative stories - the estranged husband and wife who we know are going to get back together from the first second; the psycho, chain of command-loving military guy; the rag-tag bunch of lovable tech specialists who find their beloved undersea rig taken out of their hands; and on and on. Characters live or die based on unlikely coincidences, the worst of which is undoubtedly Ed Harris' character being saved by his wedding ring, which he never takes off - symbolism doesn't get much more obvious or ridiculous. The main action sequence, an underwater sub-fight, drags on and on for no real reason. Nothing here is remotely new or interesting. Not content with that though, we also have man's folly with nuclear weapons and is man inherently good or evil? thrown in for good measure. Ultimately we get a preachy, silly ending which gives virtually no resolution to those questions - the characters learn nothing, except that if we're naughty the aliens are going to drown us all.Second, the characters. They are just totally implausible. In Aliens Cameron gave us a more believable bunch of characters, despite the fact that they were billions of miles away and hundreds of years into the future. Here they are just clichéd, boring, unappealing and predictable. The 'lovable' undersea cowboys talk in ridiculous slang and catchphrases. The military guys (perhaps presaging Avatar) are robotic and wholly defined by crew cuts and personal aggression. Of course, there is the 'crazy' guy who no-one takes seriously but who turns out to be right, the cold-but-sexy woman who knows how to take control, even a sassy black chick. It's all so predictable, and there are no surprises at all.Thirdly, as a matter of science fiction, this movie is an epic failure. We learn little to nothing about the science allegedly involved. The undersea creatures display no characteristics which reflect their environment (why would they have technology to control water through the air when they live entirely UNDER water?). The physics on display is awful (a huge station presumably weighing hundreds of tonnes is rapidly dragged by the weight of a small crane, for example). Even the science of deep sea diving is largely ignored - things crack and crumple when it is convenient from a plot perspective, but other times the characters and equipment seem to be immune to the effects of being deep underwater. Where, incidentally, there is no life, and the water is a pleasant, clear aquamarine colour.Fourthly, and most importantly, this movie is simply boring. When you have a silly plot and characters who are far from engaging, the last thing you should do is have a film which drags on and on and on, but that is precisely what this one does.A word about the special effects - they are OK by 1989 standards, but pretty awful by contemporary standards. The undersea creatures look like a bad children's cartoon, and the much celebrated water effects definitely show their age. Much more impressive are the underwater and flooding scenes, but even these are fairly average by current standards.This movie seems to hint at what was eventually going to be done much better in Avatar (right down to the fluro blue aliens). Although Avatar repeats some of the mistakes listed above, it is a far more coherent and, more importantly, engaging film. This film has plenty of defenders, but the truth is that even amongst Cameron's own body work there are many films which are far, far better than this.

The Celebration also known by its Danish name, Festen, written by Thomas Vinterberg was my first experience with Dogma 95 style and I must say it was a very refreshing experience. Through the use of the Dogma 95 filming technique the audience is invited to participate in the festivities of a wealthy man's 60th birthday, which quickly take a turn for the worst with the airing of the family's dirty laundry. The camera angles give the film an up close and personal feel as the audience becomes a party guest. The movie was nothing less than an entertaining but perverse emotional roller-coaster ride. Through the entirety of the film we, as the audience, are forced to endure to awkward situations which are created when Thomas Vinterberg capitalizes on the eccentric. The single element of this film that had the most pervasive effect on the audience's emotional response was the filming. The film was shot using a 35mm hand held camera. All light is natural and all sound and music was present during filming. In addition Vinterberg, utilizes the close up and camera angles that beckon us in. In effect these elements bring the audience into the scene providing them with a seat at the party table. Furthermore, when parts of the film are shot in a darkly light room or a room with an odd perspective the audience finds them themselves craning their necks to get the best view. Many examples of this exist in the movie, several of which I will touch upon briefly. The darkness of the filming reflects the darkness of the themes Vinterberg portrays. The overarching theme of the film is sexual abuse. Sexual abuse took precedent when Christian, the eldest son, stands to give a birthday speech for his father. He asks the party guests to choose between two speeches he has written, one a green speech and the other a yellow speech. The chosen green speech is a shock to say the least. Christian tells of the years of sexual abuse he and his sister endured at the hands of his father. This is confounded by the additional confession that the Christian's mother was aware of and even witnessed the abuse. Christian is clearly in a state of shock brought on by the recent suicide of his twin sister, Lene, and as a result is accused of making the story up. Adding to the shock value of the film is the sexual abuse apparent within the confines of marriage. Michael, the youngest brother, demands his wife to have sex with him. Several scenes prior to Christian's exposing speech we watch as the couple engage in a verbally violent disagreement. Post-disagreement Mete reluctantly agrees to lay with him which in progresses into abusive intercourse. Witnessing this abuse, the audience is left to wonder if this is norm of most Danish relationships is sexual abuse, though I fear this was not Vinterberg's goal. Furthermore this element of the film kept me entranced. Although the subject matter is not lighthearted it is emotional provocative and holds the audiences interest by embracing topics that most films wouldn't dare include. Ignoring cycles of abuse is another theme that Vinterberg exploits. Vinterberg keeps the audience engrossed in the continuous action as another theme, suppression of abuse, emerges. Initially this can be seen as Michael forcibly expels Christian from the dinner party after Christian's second attempt to unveil his father's dirty deeds. When Michael's attempts to silence Christian fail he brings him into the woods and ties him to a tree. This not only demonstrates an attempt by Michael to conceal his father's abuse but it also demonstrates his inability to control his own anger. During these scenes the audience is able to see Vinterberg's unique filming style. He uses close ups of the actors faces which increase our perception of their fear and anger. His lack of artificial lighting leaves some ambiguity as to what actually occurs in the film and makes us feel as if we are hindered by the darkness just as the actors are. Another family secret is revealed when the unsuspecting toastmaster receives a note which Helene requests he read aloud. The note confessed to the entire dinner party that Lene took her own life as a result of the sexual abuse of her father. Though she took her own life one can rightfully say that her presence was felt through the entire film. Vinterberg revives the memory of the Lene in the most intriguing ways. At the beginning of the film the audience knows very little about the status of the Lene until, Helene is tempted into child's play with her. Through this slightly unsettling game of hid and seek Helene finds her sisters suicide note. Though it may seem to the audience that Lene has served her purpose in the film she has not. The film could not be complete without an added element of confusion when Christian, in a drunken stupor, converses with Lene in what seems to be a dream or hallucination. He is then pulled from hallucinations by the ringing of his phone. When he stands to answer the phone we find that he is lying in bed with Pia, one of the house staff and a past lover. The continued relation with Lene confuses the audience and makes thin the line between reality and spirituality. In summary, Vinterberg proves to us that a movie can be captivating, engaging and even stunning using the bare minimum of filming resources. This film is contrary, in every way, to Hollywood films but it is still successful. Its success hinges on the realistic filming through low lighting and hand-held camera styles in addition to the connection we feel with characters and their dire situations.

He asks the party guests to choose between two speeches he has written, one a green speech and the other a yellow speech. The chosen green speech is a shock to say the least. Christian tells of the years of sexual abuse he and his sister endured at the hands of his father. This is confounded by the additional confession that the Christian's mother was aware of and even witnessed the abuse. Christian is clearly in a state of shock brought on by the recent suicide of his twin sister, Lene, and as a result is accused of making the story up. Adding to the shock value of the film is the sexual abuse apparent within the confines of marriage. Michael, the youngest brother, demands his wife to have sex with him. Several scenes prior to Christian's exposing speech we watch as the couple engage in a verbally violent disagreement. Post-disagreement Mete reluctantly agrees to lay with him which in progresses into abusive intercourse. Witnessing this abuse, the audience is left to wonder if this is norm of most Danish relationships is sexual abuse, though I fear this was not Vinterberg's goal. Furthermore this element of the film kept me entranced. Although the subject matter is not lighthearted it is emotional provocative and holds the audiences interest by embracing topics that most films wouldn't dare include. Ignoring cycles of abuse is another theme that Vinterberg exploits. Vinterberg keeps the audience engrossed in the continuous action as another theme, suppression of abuse, emerges. Initially this can be seen as Michael forcibly expels Christian from the dinner party after Christian's second attempt to unveil his father's dirty deeds. When Michael's attempts to silence Christian fail he brings him into the woods and ties him to a tree. This not only demonstrates an attempt by Michael to conceal his father's abuse but it also demonstrates his inability to control his own anger. During these scenes the audience is able to see Vinterberg's unique filming style. He uses close ups of the actors faces which increase our perception of their fear and anger. His lack of artificial lighting leaves some ambiguity as to what actually occurs in the film and makes us feel as if we are hindered by the darkness just as the actors are. Another family secret is revealed when the unsuspecting toastmaster receives a note which Helene requests he read aloud. The note confessed to the entire dinner party that Lene took her own life as a result of the sexual abuse of her father. Though she took her own life one can rightfully say that her presence was felt through the entire film. Vinterberg revives the memory of the Lene in the most intriguing ways. At the beginning of the film the audience knows very little about the status of the Lene until, Helene is tempted into child's play with her. Through this slightly unsettling game of hid and seek Helene finds her sisters suicide note. Though it may seem to the audience that Lene has served her purpose in the film she has not. The film could not be complete without an added element of confusion when Christian, in a drunken stupor, converses with Lene in what seems to be a dream or hallucination. He is then pulled from hallucinations by the ringing of his phone. When he stands to answer the phone we find that he is lying in bed with Pia, one of the house staff and a past lover. The continued relation with Lene confuses the audience and makes thin the line between reality and spirituality. In summary, Vinterberg proves to us that a movie can be captivating, engaging and even stunning using the bare minimum of filming resources. This film is contrary, in every way, to Hollywood films but it is still successful. Its success hinges on the realistic filming through low lighting and hand-held camera styles in addition to the connection we feel with characters and their dire situations.

No, I really loved them and thought they were awesome. Then again most kids probably go through this faze though, especially boys. So no surprise I liked this movie as a kid. Didn't love it, but it did leave an impression and didn't make me forget it. I haven't seen many Dinosaur movies, and even less that I liked. This one I found really good, even now that I'm older.Strangely I don't remember laughing a lot on this movie when I was a kid. I remember being really transfixed on the adventure and even crying when the time called for it. Not a lot of kids movies can make me cry but this one always makes my eyes go watery. I'm sure for most who have seen this as a kid or seen it in general know that the saddest seen is Little Foots mom dying. That scene for me is the one I remember most and in my opinion is one of the saddest animated kids movie moments. The movie in general, in my opinion has a good plot, stable and fun characters, and is very entertaining. Even kind of scary at times to a younger audience. All and all a really good family movie. ) ","genre":null},{"date":"3 March 2010","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Well I admit it. I liked Dinosaurs as a kid.
