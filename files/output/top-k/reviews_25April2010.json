He was right to do it. Imagine a Soviet movie about an heroic capitalist? John D. Rockefeller as iconoclastic humanist? Karl Marx distinguished between what he called false consciousness and class consciousness. In the former, you blame all your misfortunes on bad luck, personal flaws, a lousy upbringing, and so forth. In class consciousness you recognize that the problem is systemic, that you're humped because the class system is designed to keep you down at the bottom of the socioeconomic ladder. The path to improvement comes not through efforts to improve one's self but through collective power.In the film, The Grapes of Wrath, Tom Joad and Casey the Preacher achieve class consciousness. Ma Joad, with her speech about hunkering down and letting the rich destroy themselves, does not. Here, Warren Beatty as Jack Reed wavers back and forth between false consciousness and class consciousness. The choice is put to him bluntly by Jerzy Kozinski as a Red Russian leader -- what's more important, your love for your wife (Diane Keaton) or the fate of all the people of Russia? Kozinski is one of many recognizable supporting players. I don't know why, but many of them have signed on for small roles in the way that European actors do. They don't mind taking tiny parts once in a while. They don't seem to be afraid that it will damage their standing on the A list. I won't list all of the established performers with small roles but they include people like Paul Sorvino and Gene Hackman. Good on them! But only half of the movie is about the liberation of the Russian people. The other half, probably the major part, deals with the love affair between Louise Bryant (Keaton) and Beatty's character. In the early years of the 20th century there was a movement towards greater freedom. (Women didn't yet have the vote, for instance.) And there are many talky and somewhat dull arguments between Keaton and Beatty. She seems more committed to throwing off the shackles than he does.The film is definitely not a propaganda piece along the lines of, say, Mission to Moscow or North Star -- the sort of thing that came out of Hollywood during the war years. And it's not an anti-communist tract either. It's unsparing in its depiction of the results of the revolution. The aftermath of the moderate Karensky government is thoroughly familiar to anyone who knows what happens AFTER a revolution. There's an internal split based on self-interest and a lot of shouting about ideological purity. A lot of blood is often spilled, which is shown in Doctor Zhivago but not here. Things fall apart. The center cannot hold -- because there IS no center, and eventually something resembling a dictatorship is established, if only to maintain order in the streets.I rather like Reds because it's a courageous movie in displaying so flagrantly the chaos that follows the deposing (and slaughter) of Czar Nicholas. The business about liberation is treated ironically most of the time, undercutting the seriousness of the theme.I like it too because of Jack Nicholson's depiction of Eugene O'Neill as a depressed, alcoholic playwright, smothered in false consciousness, given to loving individuals rather than social classes.At the same time, the movie sometimes drags. I think I understand why the love interest and the revolutionary motives are there, and why they're necessary, but I could have done with less of the former and a little more formal explication of the latter.There are a multitude of inserts of older people talking about Reed and Bryant and the revolution and Greenwich Village after the turn of the century. Most of them weren't alive at the time, but Henry Miller is charming in his candor and cynicism.

In 1539, the Knights Templar of Malta, paid tribute to Charles V of Spain, by sending him a Golden Falcon encrusted from beak to claw with rarest jewels ----- but pirates seized the galley carrying this priceless token and the fate of the Maltese Falcon remains a mystery to this day ---. So we know that we have to find the falcon & in the process we deal with lies, murders, characters full of deceit & cunningness. You know the typical film noir settings.The Maltese Falcon is the first movie directed by John Huston who in his illustrious career was nominated for 15 Oscars. The beauty of the film is that there is not a single waste line nor a single waste shot nor a single waste performance. Everything is so perfect & each character is very well developed. I felt Huston has filtered the movie like water, over & over, until it became so perfect.The performances in the movie were of the highest order.Brigid O'Shaughnessy is not your typical film noir femme fatale as this is only the start of bigstudio film noir. I felt that Brigid O'Shaughnessy was the perfect template for the future femme fatales such as say Double Indemnity's Phyllis Dietrichson or Vertigo's Madeleine Elster. Although Brigid was responsible for the deaths of 3 people she never appears as a threat to the protagonist Sam Spade. Astor was very good in the movie. She keeps her best for the climax confrontation with Bogart.Peter Lorre as Joel Cairo gave an amazing performance. You can see the power of his performance in the climax where he goes from delighted look while opening the package - exploding on Gutman after knowing the truth about Maltese Falcon - controlled dialogue & expression after Gutman says that they will revisit Istanbul. Simply brilliant.Sydney Greenstreet enters the movie only around the 50 minute mark. He was 60 years old, this was his debut performance & he was nominated for Best Supporting Actor. His years of stage experience shows in his portrayal of Kasper Fat Man Gutman. Those subtle expressions & gentle laughs. Simply wonderful. Elisha Cook Jr. in one of his early roles as Wilmer Little Boy Cook, the cold assistant to Gutman is good. Do the words Fat Man & Little Boy ring anything in your mind?Bogart lived the role of Sam Spade. That he didn't even get an Oscar nomination for this is quite a puzzle for me. Either the real nominees have given all-time greatest performances or the Academy is dumb. Bogart's Sam Spade is one of the meanest, ruthless heroes that you will see. I heard that the original Sam Spade in the novel was a 6 feet heavy built figure. Bogart is not a big person physically but he more than makes it up with his voice & mannerisms. See that scene where he mocks his partner's widow by saying You killed my husband Sam. Be kind to me. His clap, his smile & his subtle expressions in that scene were as mean as you could see anywhere. Or that scene where he says Ya with $10000 insurance, no children & a wife who doesn't like him about his dead partner. Or the scene where he says When you're slapped, you'll take it & like it and slaps Joel Cairo. Bogart's Sam Spade is arguably the most ungenerous & masculine character until Marlon Brando gave that tour de force performance as Stanley Kowalski in A Streetcar named Desire. In a way, even Sam Spade was not a complete film noir protagonist because he was always in control of the situation except for that one scene in which he is intoxicated. Even there I didn't felt that he could be harmed.Think about the fact that Bogart was not even the first choice to play Sam Spade.Cinematography is by Arthur Edeson, who has worked for almost a 100 movies prior to this & he also did Casablanca later. He used some very innovative angles. You can observe that for most part of the film, the position of the camera is at the waist level. So we have a lot of low- angle shots which were made more famous later in Citizen Kane. The low- angle makes the already sinister characters more sinister.Max Steiner gave good background score for the movie. Editing is one of the key things for a crime mystery. Owen Marks did a fantastic job with editing. I only found one bad cut in the entire movie where Spade sends off Iva Archer before he gets a call to meet Gutman.All in all with one of the best ensemble performances that you would see in a film noir, superb script & directing, great technical achievements this is one of those films that you shouldn't miss.In fact, I was so engrossed & immersed in the story & the performances the 1st time I viewed this that I completely forgot about the other aspects of the film. I rewatched this immediately to concentrate on the other technical aspects. For me the movie, the protagonist & the femme fatale are not the ideal film noirs but rather the initial models which were developed into more defined figures for the next 2 decades of film noir. So, in a line, what is The Maltese Falcon?

The short of it is that I loved this film; just when you think you have it sussed out it throws another curve ball at you.I don't intend to spend much time considering the plot or the well known themes and questions it throws up (the blending into society, the facelessness of individuality, the materialism and commercialism of modern life etc etc) as these have been covered splendidly in the FAQ section and I could not do them any further justice.My personal, humble opinion it is all in his head; the ending of the book This Is Not An Exit seemed to me to suggest that his fantasy's were a way out of the mundaity and blandness of his existence. Having said that each time I watch the film or reconsider the book I am left with that grey area that at least some of it may have been very real and then wondering which parts may and may not have been!! I watched the film having read the book first (as I am sure many others will have done). What struck me was the skill with which the very dense, at times difficult to read dialogue had been condensed into a screenplay that very strongly retained the overriding themes of the book. The style of the film captured perfectly the scenery created by the extremely (overly?) descriptive prose in the book and at no time did it feel rushed. At no time did I think that more should have been included; the choices made when preparing the screenplay (i.e. what to include and what to leave out) were spot on and the focus on Bateman himself with less concentration on the peripheral characters in his life worked perfectly (these were, in fact, the parts of the book that felt contrived and out of place so I was happy with the choices for this reason as well).It amused me sincerely that the film was adapted and directed by a female. After all the furore by silly feminist women who clearly did not understand the satire in the book and who chose to concentrate on the graphic depiction of violence against women it must be great for Brett Easton Ellis to be able to say F*** you to them. This film and the book before it are not about gratuitous violence. The story is about greed, about jealously, about psychosis, about a person lost in a myriad of similarity where you cannot break out even if you try and even if those attempts are bloody, violent and evil. There are so many layers to the story that to dismiss it as a one dimensional attempt to shock is doing it a massive disservice.

I watched the film having read the book first (as I am sure many others will have done). What struck me was the skill with which the very dense, at times difficult to read dialogue had been condensed into a screenplay that very strongly retained the overriding themes of the book. The style of the film captured perfectly the scenery created by the extremely (overly?) descriptive prose in the book and at no time did it feel rushed. At no time did I think that more should have been included; the choices made when preparing the screenplay (i.e. what to include and what to leave out) were spot on and the focus on Bateman himself with less concentration on the peripheral characters in his life worked perfectly (these were, in fact, the parts of the book that felt contrived and out of place so I was happy with the choices for this reason as well).It amused me sincerely that the film was adapted and directed by a female. After all the furore by silly feminist women who clearly did not understand the satire in the book and who chose to concentrate on the graphic depiction of violence against women it must be great for Brett Easton Ellis to be able to say F*** you to them. This film and the book before it are not about gratuitous violence. The story is about greed, about jealously, about psychosis, about a person lost in a myriad of similarity where you cannot break out even if you try and even if those attempts are bloody, violent and evil.

The qualities that Ferrara has going for him, and that he never tires of REMINDING us he has going for him - that he is a maverick, an independent film-maker, and that he is cinematographically competent and able to give his movies a certain visual style - would be estimable if they were combined with any intelligence or with the presence in his head of any idea really worth giving visual and narrative expression to. Unfortunately, no film that Ferrara has ever made has given any evidence of either of these. His scriptwriter on this and almost all his other movies, Nicholas St. John, has regularly provided him with material of strikingly low quality, which Ferrara himself, and the generally top-class group of actors and actresses - Walken, Keitel, Sciorra - with whom he works must then labor as best they can to rescue.Keitel's bravura performance in Bad Lieutenant, for example, is the only reason I can think of for this film's being constantly praised as a landmark and a masterpiece. As a theological drama, it has about as much depth as The Song of Bernadette. And The Addiction displays the same facile, cheap, and cynically opportunistic relation to philosophical ideas as Bad Lieutenant does to religious ones. Anyone who has taken even a serious amateur interest in philosophy will recognize all the philosophical paraphernalia of St. John's script as entirely hokey right from the opening scenes on. (It is an indication of the level of Ferrara's intellectual and moral honesty that he is on record as believing, or as pretending to believe, St. John's ridiculous story that he studied philosophy at Heidelberg, Heidelberg, I suppose, being the kind of place you claim to have studied philosophy at if you want to sound really deep (those Germans, you know)). Nobody on the set appears to have been capable of instructing Lili Taylor in how to pronounce the name Sartre or the actor playing her philosophy professor in how to pronounce the name Nietzsche and, as Jonathan Rosenbaum and other intelligent reviewers have commented, the dialogue woven around this faulty name-dropping is clearly not based on any actual reading in any of these writers but just on puerile juggling with a few images and phrases gleaned from secondary and tertiary sources (the intendedly effortlessly erudite exchanges about anthropology between Lili Taylor and her first student victim about the concept of anthropology - Protagoras, Feuerbach etc. - are in fact the nonsensical result of running down a list of the historical occurrences of the term in some concise encyclopedia of philosophy).The Addiction, in other words, is as irredeemably dumb as US movies about super-clever people - Good Will Hunting etc. - invariably tend to be. Ferrara, maverick as he is or claims to be, thinks and feels no differently about the commodity intelligence than the most vulgar mainstream director. To him as to the peddler of Hollywood trash, intelligence is something that can be ordered up simply by slapping together whatever ingredients are recommended as being the right stuff if you're into that sort of thing. (This betting on heavy reps in these matters is also the reason why US cinematic portraits of intellectual life tend to lag, on average, about thirty years behind the times. The very idea that Satrre and Kierkegaard should be the burning topics of intellectual discussion at the philosophy department of a New York university in 1995 - where any student who took him- or herself even halfway seriously would have been at grips rather with Derrida and Foucault and would have laughed at the mere mention of existentialism - betrays the philosophy of this movie as philosophy for tourists.In short, an unforgivably awful movie - and another reason to shake one's head in wonder at how a relentlessly self-promoting quarter-educated New York hipster like Ferrara has succeeded in hoodwinking such a huge proportion of the cinematic establishment.

After seeing it for myself, I found it delightful, it does have its problems but a lot compensated. One is that it is really nice to look at. The cinematography and settings are really elegant, and Audrey's black dress makes her look amazing and svelte. Henry Mancini's score is also superb, full of sweet, poignant and jaunty melodies, and I have to say the song Moon River for its sublime melody and meaningful lyrics has to be one of my favourite songs of all time, it is so beautiful and romantic. In terms of performances, while George Peppard looks handsome and acts sweetly, it is Audrey's movie as she pretty much epitomises the film on her own. Her Holly Golightly, like Sigourney Weaver's Ellen Ripley, Vivien Leigh's Scarlet O'Hara, Bette Davis's Margo Channing and Ingrid Bergman's Ilsa, is very iconic as a character, like the film she is elegant, charming and enchanting even with her character flaws we still love her. In terms of comedy highlights, the early party scene really does stand out. However, despite all this, there are problems with the film, Mickey Rooney being at the top of the list. I have nothing against Rooney, but his Japanese landlord felt stereotyped and unnecessary despite one or two mildly amusing moments, and I felt Rooney overacted.

The cinematography and settings are really elegant, and Audrey's black dress makes her look amazing and svelte. Henry Mancini's score is also superb, full of sweet, poignant and jaunty melodies, and I have to say the song Moon River for its sublime melody and meaningful lyrics has to be one of my favourite songs of all time, it is so beautiful and romantic. In terms of performances, while George Peppard looks handsome and acts sweetly, it is Audrey's movie as she pretty much epitomises the film on her own. Her Holly Golightly, like Sigourney Weaver's Ellen Ripley, Vivien Leigh's Scarlet O'Hara, Bette Davis's Margo Channing and Ingrid Bergman's Ilsa, is very iconic as a character, like the film she is elegant, charming and enchanting even with her character flaws we still love her. In terms of comedy highlights, the early party scene really does stand out. However, despite all this, there are problems with the film, Mickey Rooney being at the top of the list.

At the time this film purportedly spoke to the young folks of The Sixties. If in fact it, it doesn't say a whole lot for my generation.We've got a name now for what Anne Bancroft is, we call those predatory older woman looking for young sex partners cougars. She and husband Murray Hamilton haven't been having much of a sex life for many years and she's not getting any younger. The question is asked by more than a few reviewers why would she choose the sexually inexperienced Dustin Hoffman, son of a couple that she and Hamilton socialize with. To me the answer is that part of her component is control. She doesn't want some young lady killing stud around who might just abruptly leave because there are other fish in the sea. Bancroft wants to control and dominate the situation.In the meantime Hoffman is having problems with his own parents, William Daniels and Elizabeth Wilson. Daniels wants Hoffman to start job hunting and soon, we really don't know just how long Hoffman has been The Graduate so Daniels might just have a point. Wilson thinks it would really be nice if Dustin would find a nice girl and she's got the answer. She thinks that Dustin and Katharine Ross who is the daughter of Bancroft and Hamilton would make a proper wife. Here's where I have a problem with the film. Bancroft is one possessive woman and she ain't sharing Hoffman with her daughter. She's right though for the wrong reasons. Things like that tawdry affair that she and Hoffman have been having have a way of slipping out and that would just get too freakish for one family. Of course Hoffman being the dunce he is and feeling full of sexual confidence says he'll have her come what may. What may does come indeed.I don't want to reveal any more, but I think the ending that Mike Nichols has for this film is highly unrealistic, even if you just take the characters as generational symbols.The Graduate was a big hit back in the day and is considered a classic by many. It got Mike Nichols an Oscar for Best Director and nominations came for Dustin Hoffman for Best Actor, Anne Bancroft for Best Actress, Katharine Ross for Best Supporting Actress, Best Picture, and a few others.

Within this seemingly innocent and yet irreverent statement is really the essence of how justice is meted out in the United States. It is not a straightforward linear institution in which those who are guilty are punished, and those who are innocent are freed, as most people believe it should be to maintain a healthy society. What most people don't realize is that because the justice system has become so large and complex with literally hundreds of crimes being committed every day and almost as many being tried in court, the entire institution is essentially a legalistic game. Acquittals or convictions are not necessarily the result of whether someone is truly innocent or guilty. Verdicts are the product of a host of other circumstances the strength of evidence against a suspect, the adeptness of the prosecution, the backgrounds of the jury, and, most importantly, the quality of a defendant's representation. After having been convicted of twice trying to murder his wife and multi-millionaire Sunny Von Bülow, Claus Von Bülow hired one of the best legal minds of the late 20th century, Alan Dershowitz, to handle his appeal.Reversal of Fortune (based on Dershowitz' book of the same name) is a dramatization of the circumstances surrounding the eventual vegetative state of Sunny Von Bülow, the indictment against her husband Claus Von Bülow, his first trial in which he was convicted, and the stunning appeal in which the Supreme Court of Rhode Island overturned the lower court's conviction thereby awarding the defendant a new trial. Aside from the melodrama between Claus and Sunny and the events leading up to Sunny's coma, a hefty portion of the film is devoted to the case on appeal. Defense lawyer and Harvard professor Alan Dershowitz, played by the late Ron Silver in one of his best performances, is the captain of a makeshift law-firm comprised of law students who will get their first taste of an actual case. As interesting as the flashbacks involving Claus, Sunny, their children, and some of Claus' love interests are, the scenes involving Dershowitz and the law students, and how they prepare the appeal are the most fascinating aspects of the film. Their meetings and discussions which involve dissecting the prosecution's case to find weaknesses demonstrate the behind-the-scenes preparations that occur before going into court. At one point, Dershowitz explains to his students that cases are won in the field and not the courtroom. The transcripts of the original trial become the basis by which Dershowitz' team destroys the prosecution's case. For example, the legal team go through minute details, such as syringes whose needles have insulin encrusted on them which were found at the crime scene. The students do research and are told by medical experts that dirty needles are inconsistent with injection because the skin acts as a swab and cleans the needle after injection. These are the kinds of minute details which end up having large legal implications that help determine the resulting verdict on appeal.What keeps the story moving is the outstanding acting. Jeremy Irons (in an Academy-Award-Winning performance) steals the show with his enigmatic performance of what Sunny considers not a normal person. Irons finds that strange combination of cool detachment and spontaneous passion, especially with regards to women. Over and over, Dershowitz tries without success to uncover who is client really is, aside from all the muck splashed in the tabloids. Ron Silver keeps up with Irons stride-for-stride, showing us Alan Dershowitz as the lawyer who is at first fascinated then all-consumed by the case. Glenn Close is completely believable as Sunny Von Bülow, the filthy rich heiress who likes pills, sweets, and lying in bed more than anything else. Honorable mention goes to the actors playing the students, some of whom have gone onto fine careers (both in acting and in law!) Apparently, former New York Governor Eliot Spitzer was one of Dershowitz' law students who worked on the case, although he does not appear to be mentioned by name in the film.

He cruises around New York looking for a fare and constantly finds himself drawn to the seediest parts of the city, despite his hatred of everything these places stand for and the people who live and make their living there. Right from the start we have an idea of where Travis is going from when his cab emerges from the white smoke of hellfire. Not literally of course but there is plenty of similar imagery throughout from the overhead view of the guns that the dealer lays out on the bed like a priest looking down at the altar to when Travis holds his clenched fist above the gas fire stove. Like all of Scorsese's greatest films Taxi Driver is imbued with ideas of religion and guilt.There is little plot to this film but that is unimportant, real life has no plot. Taxi Driver is about character and the character of Travis Bickle is so frighteningly real that he is captivating throughout. This is a man who fails to connect with those around him on almost any level, his date with the beautiful, idyllic, Betsy (Cybill Shepherd) goes disastrously wrong and there is even a lack of camaraderie between him and his fellow taxi drivers who are the closest thing he has to friends.

Don't let my rating fool you I like this film and have seen it quite a few times. It is one of those films where you just have to appreciate the absurdity, the bad acting and the endless macho posturing of these tough guys who are part of a special forces team sent to rescue a cabinet minister from a downed helicopter in a Central-American jungle. I had to look this part up because really what little plot there is in Predator isn't that important. It's okay but if you know the premise then you know how this film will end. That's not necessarily that big a problem here as this is a film about enjoying the action, although I do have trouble reconciling with the fact that it was directed by John McTiernan who went on to direct the far superior Die Hard.Predator is a film that does not take itself to seriously, how else can you justify lines like the one Schwarznegger delivers having speared a guerrilla to a wall with a knife, stick around. Of course a huge suspension of disbelief is needed, none more so than in the hostage rescue sequence where Dutch (Schwarzengger) and his team go around blowing everything up, with some spectacular explosions, apparently confident that none of these will kill the hostages they are meant to rescue. The team is also guilty of downright stupidity at times, such as when they waste hundreds of rounds decimating a clearing in which one of them saw an enemy that by the time everyone has turned up and started shooting is long gone. Although of course this is a film in which you rarely see anyone reload their weapon.Despite this real credit should go to McTiernan for having the patience to have the Predator stalk his prey (Dutch and co.) for a considerable amount of time before he shows his cards. This helps build up some clever suspense as we see the team through the Predator's view and hear the eerie way it hears them speak. The Predator is a fantastic creation, from its look with the dreadlocks to its impressive array of weaponry to its poor eyesight in earth's atmosphere. The scenes in which it picks off Dutch's team one by one are suspenseful and provide some fantastic action sequences which forms the best part of the film.I could go on complaining about the wooden acting, the two dimensional characters and so on but this is an 80s action movie starring Arnold Schwarznegger, that's almost the point and even if it is not, it is to be expected. Ignoring this Predator is an exciting action film, that although lacking the intelligence of The Terminator it is a good watch.

Don't let my rating fool you I like this film and have seen it quite a few times. It is one of those films where you just have to appreciate the absurdity, the bad acting and the endless macho posturing of these tough guys who are part of a special forces team sent to rescue a cabinet minister from a downed helicopter in a Central-American jungle. I had to look this part up because really what little plot there is in Predator isn't that important. It's okay but if you know the premise then you know how this film will end. That's not necessarily that big a problem here as this is a film about enjoying the action, although I do have trouble reconciling with the fact that it was directed by John McTiernan who went on to direct the far superior Die Hard.Predator is a film that does not take itself to seriously, how else can you justify lines like the one Schwarznegger delivers having speared a guerrilla to a wall with a knife, stick around. Of course a huge suspension of disbelief is needed, none more so than in the hostage rescue sequence where Dutch (Schwarzengger) and his team go around blowing everything up, with some spectacular explosions, apparently confident that none of these will kill the hostages they are meant to rescue. The team is also guilty of downright stupidity at times, such as when they waste hundreds of rounds decimating a clearing in which one of them saw an enemy that by the time everyone has turned up and started shooting is long gone. Although of course this is a film in which you rarely see anyone reload their weapon.Despite this real credit should go to McTiernan for having the patience to have the Predator stalk his prey (Dutch and co.) for a considerable amount of time before he shows his cards.

The movie sucks you in with it's fine pacing, script, and fantastic performances.The cast is as solid as it gets for a film. Two Oscar winners included, what more can I say. There are few movies that can be mentioned in the same breath as The Gift when it comes to suspenseful thrillers. It's hard to pick a favorite, but Blanchett played the part well and was convincing as a psychic medium. The stress that comes with having such a gift is depicted well by her. Giovanni Ribisi was probably the show stealer, and I say probably because the other cast members were masterful, including Keanu Reeves who had never crossed my mind as someone who could play a villainous character. He was great, as was Hiliary Swank.The script was solid, and there were no wasted scenes in this movie at all. Each scene makes the next one better. Another great thing about this film is that it wasn't predictable. It keeps you guessing until the minor twist at the end. I wouldn't call this a powerful film, or one you'll talk about for days after viewing it, but definitely thought provoking.7\/10 for it's fine acting, directing and story.

Like the character of Joe Blake's (Willis) cousin Harvey (Troy Garrity). Didn't he quit the bank robbery business at some point along the way as he tried to pick up his dream girl hitchhiker? But there he was in the thick of things at the finale. So did he quit just to fool the audience, with Joe and Terry (Thornton) in on the ruse? I didn't get that, and I'm not going back to try and figure it out.But I generally liked the chemistry between Willis and Billy Bob. I don't know if throwing Blanchett into the mix was all that valuable or necessary. The other two palookas could have managed their bank heist without her being around. The love triangle really didn't work for me, once again referring to those less plausible elements I referenced earlier.The twist ending following the opening set up was pretty clever though. Not really buying it, but it did manage to extend a bit of misdirection offered by 'Criminals At Large'. If I can get my hands on a better quality print of the flick than the one I watched, I just might be up for a second viewing. In the meantime, I'll come away reasonably satisfied with the first pass, but without a glowing recommendation.
