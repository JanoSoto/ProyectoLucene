[{"date":"17 November 2013","score":"","review":" Reeves is the chosen one to defeat a bunch of supercomputers controlling the world with a matrix. Some of the clichéd dialog tells you that the plot and characters are just background music to show off some really huge and grossly ugly special effects. I especially dislike the scene where Reeves and his female partner break into the high security skyscraper to defeat the forces that have imprisoned Morpheus (Lawrence Fishburne. He is armed the neck with weapons and ammunition to blast hundreds of people away. I cannot help but think how this might have inspired James Holmes when he went to a Batman movie in a costume concealing a similar arsenal around his chest to shoot twenty or thirty people. People who produce these ultra violent shows are mechanics who never think about what the end results of their work might be.
