[{"date":"15 April 2014","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" The secret, I don't know... I guess you've just gotta find something you love to do and then... do it for the rest of your life. For me, it's going to Rushmore.The Royal Tenenbaums has always been my favorite Wes Anderson movie and I always thought it was because it was the first one of his that I had seen, but it can officially move over now because I have a new favorite Rushmore. This film was so charming, the soundtrack so cool, and the characters so well developed that I was completely in love with it once the credits started rolling. Not only is it my favorite Wes Anderson film, but it also belongs on my all time favorite list as well. I am a sucker for coming of age stories and this was a great one with perhaps one of Anderson's best developed characters from all his filmography Max Fischer. All of Anderson's films have a similar style with offbeat and quirky themes and a hyper reality where the characters sometimes resemble those we imagine in our heads when we are reading a fantasy book. At times they are hard to connect with because they seem to belong in another time and place, but Wes manages to draw us into his world kind of like in the same way we are drawn to a theater play. That is why I also loved the special touches from Anderson as he incorporates school plays with wonderful productions into his movies. I think Rushmore is his most complete film with a charming ending, a memorable odd couple pairing, and a weird love triangle that features some of Anderson's most romantic work (similar in that sense to Moonrise Kingdom). As much as I enjoyed his first film, Bottle Rocket, it was Rushmore where he truly defines and finds his style with those production designs that seem taken from a stage play or a colorful children's book (especially seen in the scenes where Max visits the principal's office). I absolutely fell in love with Rushmore and this will be the measuring stick for Wes Anderson's films from now on.This wonderful and witty screenplay written by Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson begins with a dream sequence where Max Fischer (Jason Schwartzman) is in math class solving an extremely difficult equation and thus saving his classmates from ever having to open a math book again. His friend, Dirk (Mason Gamble), awakes him just before a millionaire industrialist named Herman Blue (Bill Murray) is about to begin his chapel speech. He has two sons in Rushmore Academy, one of the most expensive and prestigious schools in the country. Max is fascinated by this man's speech and so at the end he introduces himself to Herman and the two form a special bond together. Max is in love with Rushmore and his entire life revolves around the school and he finds in Herman someone who has achieved the success he's aiming for, while Herman is a disillusioned man who has lost his purpose in life and sees in Max someone determined who enjoys life. Up to this point one would think Max is the perfect student, but the school's headmaster, Dr. Guggenheim (Brian Cox) explains to Herman that he actually is the worst scholarly student due to his involvement in dozens of extracurricular activities (such as being the editor of the school newspaper, president of the chess, astronomy, beekeeping, and French clubs, captain of the fencing team, and director of the school play). Unlike the rest of the students, Max isn't a wealthy kid, his father Bert (Seymour Cassel) is a barber, so he's a scholarship student that is about to lose it due to his bad grades. Max and Herman's friendship is tested when they both fall in love with the widowed first grade teacher, Rosemary Cross (Olivia Williams). This is were the thin line between friends and enemies begin as Max and Herman begin a feud over Miss Cross.What makes Rushmore stand out above other Wes Anderson films (I have liked all of them) is the great pairing of Jason Schwartzman and Bill Murray's characters. Both of them, despite having completely opposite personalities, complete each other because they see in each other what they want to become. Max aspires to be successful in life and doesn't want to become a barber like his father (that is why he always lies about his profession), while Herman despite having it all is completely disillusioned with his marriage and spoiled children. Max's passion for life is what captivates Herman because it is what he has lost. This bond is broken once Rosemary enters the picture and they both become infatuated with winning her love. Max will do anything for her, including building a giant aquarium in the school's baseball diamond or directing a successful play. Max is my favorite character despite not being entirely likable, while Murray's portrayal of Herman is sensational. He delivers one of his best and most memorable performances and shines in each scene he shares with Max or Rosemary. There are several hilarious lines and quirky moments that also balanced out perfectly with the more subtle emotional and romantic ones. This film has a lot of heart and Anderson really delivers here with his unique style (a lot of his trademarks can be found here like the slow-motion and wide angle shots, the inclusion of at least one Rolling Stones song on the soundtrack, the underwater shot, and the influence of the Charlie Brown cartoon). It's an inspired film and Anderson creates a unique world that at times seems distant from reality, but somehow he manages to create these rich characters that are easy to identify with or relate to in such a way that they manage to touch us without being overly sentimental.

I felt this film was just about a great and excellent movie, and here below is why.The story is smartly done and for a gangster film it is quite surprising as many would just have big gun fights and little dialogue, but because this is a comedy too the film contains some great lines and can be thoroughly enjoyed all the way through. I especially enjoyed the ending which was well done and all the build up to the end is crafted very well too, the film has no slow parts but can become a little repetitive in the middle part, but I think the ending puts an end to any parts that are less fun to watch.Jason Statham puts in a performance that is hard to judge, on one hand the character may seem un emotional, or maybe Statham was just being a bad actor here, but in any case it doesn't ruin the movie and goes quite well actually. Brad Pitt as the Irish boxer is hilarious and with his fast words to match his punches he makes this film flow nicely and makes it more fun than it already is. The cast is full of great faces from those who play Cockney traders all the time to New York mob bosses, the film has all the elements that a London based crime film needs to be great.Guy Ritchie over see's the entire project with style and grace and manages to yet again make not the first but the last of his epic gangster works. The script is one of the highlights of this film with such good lines and even words I swear he makes up, Ritchie delivers yet again and maybe even matches his work on Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels. I liked the fighting as it seemed intense and real and even certain deaths kind of make you feel slightly disturbed as to the reality of the corpse's. The film is a bit simple it is fair to say and although I have praised the ending on this, the plot it follows is nothing new and sometimes even seems similar to Ritchie's past work. Some violence can seem unnecessary and only there to add a fear factor but I will stick by my rating that this film is a great film as I did truly feel the plot is smart toward the end, the acting is solid and overall it is fun and best not to just pick at constantly.Those who love a good gangster film will love this as it contains all the elements and packs a real punch that should make viewers enjoy it all. Film goers who like a kind of action movie with a comedic twist will also enjoy as it contains hilarious things at times with some truly great fight sequences that can put you on the edge of your seat too. Those that won't like it, basically anyone who dislikes gangster films or bloody violence, it is more of a rating thing I feel.I give this a 8\/10, just about a great film, nowhere near superb but also far away from just being a simply good film, is it excellent. With this if you watch with a little cheeky smile you will surely enjoy this and even the horrific threats used throughout this film still don't seem to add much effect to your sense of enjoyment as it is all tongue in cheek. I believe Ritchie truly delivers here what we want to see, some more work in the future from Ritchie too because judging by this film , he is one smart writer and director.

","genre":"Comedy, Crime"},{"date":"15 April 2014","score":"","review":" After attempting to kill them and then subsequently committing suicide himself, a man leaves his two children stranded in the middle of the Australian outback. A chance meeting with an Aboriginal boy who is out on his walkabout initiation offers a chance of survival for these kids who are completely out of their depth in such an unforgiving environment.Walkabout was directed by famed cinematic innovator Nicolas Roeg. Along with films such as Picnic at Hanging Rock and Wake in Fright, it formed part of the cinematic movement that has since been described as the Australian New Wave. These were a collection of films made in Australia that explored aspects of the country that had hitherto not been dealt with cinematically. Walkabout is notable in several ways, both stylistically and thematically. It contrasts western urban civilisation with the primitive indigenous culture. The clash is most obvious between the city children and the Aboriginal boy. But despite the fact that the latter is unsubtitled the whole time and whose actions aren't always clearly understood, it's the city culture that is presented as insane. For instance, the opening voice exercises that the girl school work on seem quite bizarre, while several of the white characters we meet along the way act in ways that are at best strange and at others coldly callous. The film often contrasts the beauty of the natural world with the functional human habitations and the rotting junk they leave behind. The children connect to the Aborigine differently too, the young boy is able to communicate and relate to him in an instinctive way that the older girl cannot as she has already been too processed by her culture to the extent that she finds it much harder to connect. The implication is that the civilising effect takes us away from something pure, some kind of innocence the youngster has not as yet lost.As it is, the girl (Jenny Agutter) and the Aborigine boy (David Gulpilil) become a source of sexual fascination for one and other. But while there is palpable sexual tension, theirs is a doomed romantic attraction. The boy never understands that what the girl really seeks is to return to her home. The language barrier prevents communication beyond the basic but the boy clearly thinks his encounter with these white children must be simply part of his walkabout initiation; another part of becoming a man. Sadly, this leads him to engage in a tribal mating dance thinking it is the logical thing to do, which unsurprisingly freaks the girl out. The result is his suicide because he thinks he has failed the ultimate test, the tragic irony of course is that he has inadvertently carried out a great deed worthy of any man in saving these children from certain death. He seems oblivious to this just as he is unaware what the children really seek, illustrated brilliantly in the scene where he encounters a white girl near a settlement, the children never see her nor the white community, never knowing how close they are to what they seek.Walkabout is an adventure-drama that is very minimalist in most ways. It has nameless characters, a basic narrative and sparse dialogue. The scene where the father tries to kill his children is partly so effective because there has been absolutely no build up to it. The small cast all do excellent work but ultimately its director Roeg's film. This one-time cinematographer ensures that this is a movie that is visually incredible at all times. The Australian outback is the right shape to fit a widescreen frame beautifully and Roeg makes the most of this when he captures the landscape, plant and animal life in consistently interesting ways. His famed bold editing techniques are evident too with some juxtapositions of images that sometimes highlight themes and other times disturb. He also uses freeze frames to add to the beauty but which also adds to the strangeness. It's also one of those films with abundant nudity that never feels exploitative in any way but natural and important to the overall whole. In the final analysis, this is one of the most beautiful looking films you are likely to see and for that alone it's worth watching. It's one of those films that just gets better and better every time I see it.

The children connect to the Aborigine differently too, the young boy is able to communicate and relate to him in an instinctive way that the older girl cannot as she has already been too processed by her culture to the extent that she finds it much harder to connect. The implication is that the civilising effect takes us away from something pure, some kind of innocence the youngster has not as yet lost.As it is, the girl (Jenny Agutter) and the Aborigine boy (David Gulpilil) become a source of sexual fascination for one and other. But while there is palpable sexual tension, theirs is a doomed romantic attraction. The boy never understands that what the girl really seeks is to return to her home. The language barrier prevents communication beyond the basic but the boy clearly thinks his encounter with these white children must be simply part of his walkabout initiation; another part of becoming a man. Sadly, this leads him to engage in a tribal mating dance thinking it is the logical thing to do, which unsurprisingly freaks the girl out. The result is his suicide because he thinks he has failed the ultimate test, the tragic irony of course is that he has inadvertently carried out a great deed worthy of any man in saving these children from certain death. He seems oblivious to this just as he is unaware what the children really seek, illustrated brilliantly in the scene where he encounters a white girl near a settlement, the children never see her nor the white community, never knowing how close they are to what they seek.Walkabout is an adventure-drama that is very minimalist in most ways. It has nameless characters, a basic narrative and sparse dialogue. The scene where the father tries to kill his children is partly so effective because there has been absolutely no build up to it. The small cast all do excellent work but ultimately its director Roeg's film. This one-time cinematographer ensures that this is a movie that is visually incredible at all times. The Australian outback is the right shape to fit a widescreen frame beautifully and Roeg makes the most of this when he captures the landscape, plant and animal life in consistently interesting ways. His famed bold editing techniques are evident too with some juxtapositions of images that sometimes highlight themes and other times disturb. He also uses freeze frames to add to the beauty but which also adds to the strangeness. It's also one of those films with abundant nudity that never feels exploitative in any way but natural and important to the overall whole. In the final analysis, this is one of the most beautiful looking films you are likely to see and for that alone it's worth watching. It's one of those films that just gets better and better every time I see it.

With the right mix of comedy and drama to go down with it too, The Truman Show shows us what a show is all about and in a true sense shows us how obsessed the ordinary person is with certain peoples lives. I felt the film was safely a great movie, and here below is why I felt that about it all.The story is superbly smartly done and whoever even thought if this idea is just awesome, it brings us all the elements we want to see from a film like this too and certain moments when Truman is finally seeing what the world is all about are just fantastic. The film isn't scared to be fun either as the story although is serious, the things we see in it sometimes aren't and we can get a few laughs out of this but as I said before, it incorporates the right amount of drama into it's plot too. One minor thing is that the for it's running time of 103 minutes it manages to fit such a complex plot into such a short amount of time, just brilliant in my opinion.Jim Carrey portrays Truman in the way we always expect from Carrey, loud and very crazy, although this isn't like all his roles as Carrey has to deal with the drama too and manages not to always be trying to be funny, a good job from him. Ed Harris as the TV network head is kind of a strange mix of evil and goodness, where as he wants the show to continue, you can also tell it slightly eats him up that Truman is shown to people like this. The entire cast do an excellent job and even the odd policeman or shoe owner seems to do there performance with a hop and a smile, just good fun had by all.Peter Weir does a fun job and really makes this his prime artistic vision that is brought to life perfectly, this is probably his best piece of work in my opinion. Andrew Niccol the writer also chips in with his artistic vision in writing to create dialogue that just keeps are eyes on the screen to see what this insane thing is all about. I loved the sets used and not to ruin some cool things which you will see for yourself but some things are positioned in some pretty neat places too.Although the film is great, it isn't without maybe minor things which stop it from being superb, Like for example I didn't find this that funny and although it fun and bouncy when trying to be funny, you won't be crying with laughter at this. I also felt the ending was poor and although it makes for an interesting end and one you definitely wouldn't expect, we don't get to explore much of it and just ends right there right then. It isn't perfect but it is has very little problems so if you ignore them things, this could be one of the best films you will ever see.For those who love Jim Carrey well this is probably one of if not his best work in film and although as I said he holds back on humour slightly, he still manages a fantastic performance as Truman which mixes a lot of elements together. I think if you ever wanted a thought provoking film then this is it, I don't think it make you think philosophically, but it makes you think about human nature and lying etc, what the world really thinks of other people and how we talk about each other.Overall will give it a 8\/10, Safely a Great movie, I couldn't recommend this much more to you and especially to those who consider themselves as film connoisseurs as I feel this could be essential viewing. Have fun with this movie and it will reward you, come in thinking of it as super serious and you will be disappointed, I can assure you that watching this can give you a little smile and although sometimes you might feel like shouting GET OUT OF THERE TRUMAN, you still just feel happy for him the entire way through.

Instead of money, Gaunt asks each person to play a practical joke of sorts on another person in the town.

The only person who seems to see gaunt for what he is, and avoids the temptation himself is town sheriff Alan Pangborn (Harris). He tries to convince the town that there is a devil among them. This is a very subtle tale of horror from Stephen King. Instead of using demons or possession to do his dirty work, the devil uses intellect to do his damage. It is played out in a very clever way and screen writer W.D. Richter certainly makes the script and film fun and amusing. However, there isn't much horror in this film outside of the scary idea of the devil pitting people against each other. Entertaining from start to finish, and all the amusing bits work, but the subtleties of the story and the lack of any true out in the open horror may turn off horror fans looking for gore and slit throats.

It was an age of dramatic change and rebellion, where the auteur and the art-house were fully realised as commodities and the exploitation genre arose from a lack of the social inhibition that the previous decades so delicately cultivated. The Bond films, too civilised to be exploitation and too mainstream to be art-house, had simply lost their audience. That was until 1977's The Spy Who Loved Me, which shocked many by embracing the uniqueness of Bond instead of limply re-contextualising the spy in then popular genres like Blaxploitation and Kung-Fu. It was fresh, it was inventive, it was over-the-top, and it was strangely poignant in regards to the treatment of Roger Moore's lothario Bond. It was, in short, a resurrection, attracting rave reviews and great box office.So producer Albert R.

And let me tell you, dear readers, I'm not joking about this being the same film. As a bit of an interesting exercise, try comparing the opening sequences of 'Moonraker' and 'Spy'. Perhaps you may notice a few similarities, like the villain hijacking a vehicle, M asking for 007 and instead getting an innuendo, Bond being lured into a honey trap by villains who want him dead for vaguely defined reasons, and finally Bond in free fall until the last minute when he suddenly has a parachute. Yeah, original.And the similarities don't end there! You also get a billionaire Blofeld surrogate (this one played rather well by Michael Lonsdale) with a plot to destroy the world, Jaws, a rival intelligence agent as Bond girl, and a final scene where Bond embarrasses his superiors by engaging in a round of decidedly un-private fornication. I understand that a franchise as long running as the Bond series cannot avoid repetition, but this is ridiculous!Even where this film does distinguish itself from its predecessor, it is flagrantly ripping off Star Wars. The final thirty minutes of this picture essentially constitute the highlights of that picture with a smug, alcoholic, sex-crazed sociopath thrown into the mix. The special effects are laudable, but you barely notice for all the Megalodon-jumping camp they represent.And speaking of 'jumping the shark', what precisely were the producers thinking when they conceived of a hovercraft gondola? And a midget girlfriend for Jaws? AND A BLOODY DOUBLE-BLOODY-TAKE PIGEON!What I find particularly aggravating about this film, though, is how little it resembles the book it is based on. Ian Fleming's Moonraker was one of the better entries in his iconic espionage series, with a simple yet suspenseful plot and some good, old-fashioned racism against the Germans, and to not see it realised on the big-screen simply because it wasn't 'ambitious enough' for Broccoli's tastes is utterly infuriating.This is not my least favourite Bond film of the official series (because Never Say Never Again doesn't even deserve to be called a Bond film), but it certainly makes the bottom five. Even Roger Moore, who I unashamedly love as Bond, couldn't save it. In fact, his persona is so exaggerated for this installment that he comes dangerously close to being insufferable. The film does have some positive qualities &#x96; the mise-en-scene is lovely and John Barry delivers another superlative score (though his lyrics for the theme song are straight out of a George Lucas movie... how appropriate) &#x96; but in the end the whole product amounts to an utterly horrid piece of self-depreciating camp that revels in the fact it doesn't give a damn anymore about telling a compelling story.

Nobody can make a 'spoiler' for this film, I swear. Hence I deliberately avoid spoiler alert here. Mulholland Drive is one of the phenomenal work of David Lynch. It proclaims the brilliant direction of Lynch and I feel a trifle uneasy to find out a suitable genre for this movie apart from neo-noir. Since this is an ambiguous movie, viewers are given the freedom to decrypt it according to the didactics of their subconscious mind. Apparently the director hesitated to impart the gist of this movie thinking that the audience should criticize it without his assistance and certainly, this is what that distinguishes Lynch from the other directors. His movies are far beyond the standard perspective of Hollywood film-noir thus I feel a trifle uneasy to tag it as neo-noir or film-noir. David Lynch is renowned for his surreal style applying to the general precis of genres like film-noir, neo-noir, thriller, mystery and so on. Rather than exerting the graphical aspects of surrealism, he utilizes the epistemological angle of surrealism by means of the complicated story. The chronological order of the story turns indefinite as it proceeds and especially when the viewer start confounding what reality is. Even with a reasonable chronological story line, the logic of the events is still very illusive. He presents a film that challenges viewers to suspend belief of what they are experiencing through his juxtaposition of cinematography, cliché, surrealism, background music, lighting, nightmares\/fantasies and nonlinear story lines. Apparently he avoided dramatic dialogues deliberately out of the film.Naomi Watts achieved an outstanding performance. It's really challenging to impersonate two mutually exclusive personae (Betty\/Diane). Laura Harring supported her well taking the role of Rita as well as Camila and she had a great chemistry with Naomi. The other actors did their role very well regardless of the importance of their roles. The intensity of light has been wisely utilized in order to scale their emotive status. Diane's dreams were shown in bright light especially during her arrival at the apartment. Also her emotional breakdown was rendered with darkness. Lynch used different camera positions throughout the movie most of then were hand-held point of view, so that the viewer identify with the suspense of the character in his or her particular space. Discrete style was also adopted to make deviations from the expected hand-held views, so that the multiple perspectives keep contexts from merging, significantly troubling our sense. Also sound-mixing and editing was excellent. Mild background-scores enhanced situations. Apart from the eerie and mysterious atmosphere of a set of problems, the objective of this movie is to bring out the language of an unconscious mind. The objects we see in our dreams have a relation to our real life, some of them would be easy to interpret while some may be metaphorical representing some qualities or emotional aspects. The tagline for Mulholland Drive is A love story in the City of Dreams. As we can see, Diane's struggle to love herself is what gives the film its poignant power, even more so than her doomed struggle to love Camilla. And that is as it should be, because we do not get much help understanding why Camilla is the person whom she is, but Diane's mind is laid open to us. In the end, Diane shoots herself and it shows Betty and Rita beaming at each other after which a woman in the Club Silencio balcony whispers Silencio as the screen fades to black. These images float in an indeterminate zone between fantasy and reality, which is perhaps the genuinely metaphysical dimension of the cinematic image. This indeterminate zone ended up by 'Silencio' which makes it hypothetical. I felt an indirect fatalism from that scene as if an external authority suppressing her unconscious mind to be silent. I felt it uncomfortable to watch such a pessimistic ending where everything became static and dark. I believe that the ending scene can be interpreted pessimistically as well as optimistically depending on the subconscious of audience. For me, it was pretty much pessimistic. I should not have said that. Erase it. Unleash your mind and enjoy the eternal ride to world of David Lynch. Good luck!

On face value this is a film full of horrific violence but it is so much more than that. Kubrick's direction eerily portrays the stark realism of a nightmarish, dystopian future by using dim, natural lighting and hand-held camera shots to make the film feel even more real for the viewer and to mirror the dream like world that Alex lives in. Not mention that most of the violence and rape scenes are set against a classical music score which just adds to surreal uneasiness that 'ultraviolence' is the norm emphasised by the theatrical way in which these scenes are filmed which has led to criticism that the film condones violence. Hence, making the film so controversial and the reason why Kubrick himself banned the film from circulation in the United Kingdom until his death, and indeed the film can be hard to stomach but this is an absolute necessity to fully understand the dystopia and the main character, Alex. I say main character because I see Alex as neither the protagonist nor antagonist which makes this one of those rare films where you can never sympathise with the main character in anyway. However, this is also the reason that this film works as it portrays that deep, hidden dark place in all of us and shows us what would happen if it were take over us and this is perhaps the reason why Alex is seen by many as one of the greatest villains in film. On the surface, he is just like any of us but with a dark love of violence and abuse and this is further reflected in the way the future is portrayed in the film. Many cite the film as a dark satire which I believe to be true due to the fact the dystopian future heavily reflects times of the 1960s in the midst of youth rebellion and drugs, sex and rock n roll lifestyle which has taken over in that the youth rebel against elders which is true in the film and culture nowadays. It is then important to touch on the morality of choice, in the film the priest questions Alex's right as a human being to choose between the right and wrong path when the government brainwash Alex through aversion therapy to be violently ill when thinking of anything bad. The government are not interested in the individual and whether they actually understand why violence and crime is wrong, they are only interested in limiting the number of prisoners and limiting the number of people committing crime regardless of the individual thought. My take on the ending therefore, is that when Alex says he is cured no longer under the influence of the aversion therapy, he truly is cured it's just that he has made his very own choice to take the wrong path, so to speak, making Alex even more despicable than at the start. A clockwork orange is a film not without controversy and its critics but I believe it is a terrifying insight into humanity and a film that begs the viewer to really think and will reveal a new layer on each viewing. With a brilliant lead actor, this film is gruelling but an absolute must for Kubrick fans or any real film fans.

He has directed and produced so many classic films, and most notably for the Science Fiction genre. But I have to say, I think A.I is overrated. And to be quite frank it becomes a mess midway through. I thought the movie would be the boy trying to fit into his new family and the trials and tribulations. But once the mother leaves him it dives into an unsatisfying territory.Without any true stars leading the film besides perhaps Jude Law, your stuck with Haley Joel Osment, who his best role is still Pay it Forward in my opinion. I realize he is a robot, but he becomes whiny for most of the movie. But there were parts I really did enjoy. The scenes with the mother were a definite highlight. In particular, the ending scene with him laying there with his 'mommy' served as a pleasing ending to an overall disappointing sci-fi.I was completely thrown off by the Aliens who come in 2000 years later.

What do I mean by fluff? I mean movies that are cheesy, fun, a project that may not be a Citizen Kane or a Return of the King or a Empire Strikes Back, but something that was made to do what I believe movies are ultimately made for,to entertain. The Blob is that fluffy entertainment.I went into this movie, only with the knowledge that this is a cult- classic and is part of the pretty prestigious, Criterion library. So, what a surprising treat it was to see Steve McQueen as the star of this flick. If anything is a guaranteed plus in this movie, it's his performance. He plays, kind of, the typical teen that you would see in every horror movie. But this is Steve McQueen, he brings a realness and a believable presence to his character. He tries his hardest to warn his small town from the horrors of the title monster and really take his side. The rest of the cast is pretty decent for what they bring, but let's talk about star here, The Blob itself, or as it's referred to in the film, the mass. The film is over half a century old, and the gloppy SFX look as awesome as ever. Again, this isn't Avatar, but the blob effects mixed with the overall look of the movie give this film, a timeless look to me. From the costumes, to the color scheme of the town the movie takes place in. It's a very simple story, but the ride it takes you on is quite the roller coaster, all the way up to the classic climax which has me grinning from ear to ear. Taking place in a theater and seeing this massive group of extras running away from the slow moving terror, surprisingly, keeps replaying over and over in my mind. It's so B-movie, so campy. The score and especially the opening tune are also little pluses in one of the most fun movie experiences I've had watching a movie.

Being all about the rape and murder of a young Vietnamese girl by U.S. troops, it's understandable why this film produced much controversy and why there are so many quasi-political reasons for liking\/disliking it. CASUALTIES of WAR is based on something that actually happened, and I'm sure there are some departures from how exactly it all happened. While the critical aspects are obviously factual, I'm appraising this film simply as a drama and will let others quibble about how true or untrue the specifics are.Though he comes across as just a little TOO squeaky-clean, Michael J. Fox is decent in the lead role of Private Eriksson. I've noticed a number of criticisms of Sean Penn's portrayal of young charismatic Sergeant Meserve, but I find him to be an utterly convincing and memorable character and think this is one of Penn's very best performances, which is saying a lot. Those who play the other four soldiers in the understrength squad are similarly real, as are many of the supporting cast, particularly Dale Dye as Captain Hill and Ving Rhames as Lieutenant Reilly. Thuy Thu Le's strong performance as the victim is also noteworthy.Viewed simply as a war film, CASUALTIES of WAR has all the elements that anyone would look for in that genre. Before the pivotal event occurs, there is a lot of gripping combat footage of different types in different locations and situations with all the necessary plot, character development, and sense of place. Fine script too, believably quirky without falling to the stereotypical soldier-talk we often encounter in films of this sort. There are also many themes to analyze if you're into it, especially in what this film shows us about the ironies of military justice. And let's not forget the basic conflict of CASUALTIES of WAR. A crime of this nature can never be justified, of course, but this film does the best that can be done in showing the how and why of it all. Some have objected because they think it makes our troops look bad. It's an unavoidable fact, however, that a number of crimes of this magnitude did in fact occur during the Vietnam War, and they occurred more often than we'd probably like to think. At the same time, I do not think it's ever suggested that all or even most American troops in that war committed acts like the one shown here.Finally, CASUALTIES of WAR has a darkly beautiful ending.

For explain my thought about Matrix, I have to say something about directors. This movie is amazing and it's mainspring is Wachowski brothers. They made a movie step by step, they draw camera angles, they shoot movie like they want to be. And Keanu Reeves... Oh... I think there are no word to explain this man. I mean, his acting incredibly awesome. And his personality, what he lived, what he have been living. He is just amazing. I know he couldn't make movies like Matrix trilogy but it doesn't change anything. Well, that is what I think. Whatever, if we return to the main topic, this movie have best thing with science, fiction, special effects, actors, story and etc. I am going to draw it fine. Matrix trilogy have been my favorite movies and they will be forever.

Put the two together and you'll get yourself one charming action-comedy, where tough Los Angeles cop Sgt. Joe Bomowski (Stallone) gets a visit from his nurturing, feisty and fearless mother Tutti (Getty), who beings to meddle in Joe's life affairs, interfering with his police work and love life.There are some very oddball and corny humor with some campy dialog in the movie, at mostly the expense of Stallone and Getty. The supporting actors were given the back burner and the villains were unforgettable. And yet, while the plot goes at a very steady-pace with limited action, I've found the comedic chemistry between Stallone and Getty, which make up most of the movie, to be pretty entertaining and fun to watch and is, at times, heartwarming. Getty's obsessive behavior to be very baby-nurturing to Stallone as he responds in his frustrated way is itself classic. And, it's not everyday you see a petite, motherly, 68 year-old lady brandish a gun and deal with gangsters! While not an action flick that would blow you out of your seats, you will get several laughs out of this movie.Grade B- ","genre":null},{"date":"15 April 2014","score":"4 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" Sylvester Stallone is an iconic action star and Estelle Getty was a hilarious, sarcastic and witty Golden Girl.

It is very feminist, perhaps more than necessary but I like the plot, the camera shots and the play of the two actresses. Their growing self-confidence and their determination to regain their dignity and their own lives even at the cost of death is something that is shown very well, in a convincing way. There is no happy-end, but because of their heroic struggle, I was not depressed at the end. What I did not like was that the tempo was too slow in the first half of the film. And somehow the introduction to the whole story is too long. Also, I think that the film would have been much better if the two leading characters had been more intelligent and deeper. They are too shallow and superficial and this prevents their drama to reach its full potential. In this way the movie becomes less dramatic&#x97;this is my point. And probably because of this, the authors have put car chases which are out-of-place in this film. Because this is not an action and should not be! The scene when Louise gives her jewelries to an unknown old man, without the two exchanging even a word struck me as artificial and totally cut off from the plot. There are other small weaknesses but in all, it is a good, moving film which is worth watching.

Ford and Heche show real chemistry and they also show good comedic ability in their roles. Schwimmer pretty much renews his ole role of friends Ross but it works here and Obradors adds a certain Je ne sais quoi if ya get my drift. Overall this movie has a lot going for it, I guess you would call it a romantic comedy but it's got good action, good humor, Danny Trejo as a no lines saying pirate (not one line, really people? Sorry Danny) and a good story that works well for what it is...a fun movie. This is a great film to watch with a date as it really caters to both sexes and should be entertaining to most who watch, so sit back and kick yer feet up and just enjoy the ride people.
