The movie has great visuals and great special effects. the only problems i really have with this film are the characters and the beginning. i thought the film had a bit of a slow start when the spaceship crashes on a strange planet. as for the characters i thought they could have been developed a little more. some were developed and some weren't. I thought Vin diesel was great as Riddick and i thought his character was cool he's an escaped convict and a killer.I also really liked Radha Mitchell in this film i thought her acting was good and i found her character likable and interesting. I also found the Riddick character interesting, the character had a certain mys-teak about him which is probably why i found him interesting.Another thing i found interesting about Riddicks character is that he could see in the dark with his strange bright eyes,i thought that was a cool idea for a movie.I liked the idea of a group of people all being stranded out on a forbidden planet and having to survive. you have these Arab men and two women a few other men,some kid and of course Riddick,and the kid seemed to like Riddick and find him interesting and i thought it was funny the way the kid kept copying Riddick and wearing sunglasses just like him. I just found this film quite exciting especially later on in the film because we are introduced to these Evil winged Creatures which i found fascinating. these creatures only come out during the night which is another good idea the writer had. so the group of people are safe while the sunlight is out but the moment the sun goes down that's when everyone is put in danger and everyone will have to work together to survive and escape and i really like that idea its a good idea for a sci-fi movie and i Love sci-fi films which is probably why this film appealed to me because it has all the right elements to make an exciting story.I thought the film was Written and Directed very well.The film is sometimes suspenseful and even a little creepy at times during the night scenes. the creatures were creepy and i thought they had a fantastic design and they looked very ferocious. all the people had to run and hide from these creatures. i must say i found the creatures very interesting and they were cool to look at.some people get killed by the creatures and some survive and the key to surviving is to stay in the light because later in the film they find out the creatures don't like light, so they carry lights around with them to keep the creatures away. Vin Disel had some really cool dialogue and some really cool BadAss moments in this movie. there was a very cool scene toward the end of the film were Riddick killed this creature when he saw it attacking Rada Michelle. Riddick just went crazy! and knocked the stuffing out of the creature! and stabbed it repeatedly! and i love the line of dialogue he gave after. (It did not know who it was f**king with!.) that was one of the coolest moments in the movie and that is definitely one of my favourite scenes of his.All in all i thought this was a Fun sci-fi movie. I like Radha Mitchell and i like Vin diesel and if you want me to be honest i think the guy is a Badass in every film he's in.the guy always plays cool characters and in this film he's kind of like an anti hero which is interesting. to sum things up is this film perfect, No but its one hell of a good Movie its one that i found very exciting and involving and i got sucked into the story,and anyone that hasn't seen this film should definitely give it a watch i thought it was a very well made sci-fi film.

We watched the film while someone played the organ music to correspond with the scenes in the film. I'll admit it was a fun experience since it was one of those community gatherings in October. But also Dracula is one of my favorite fictional foes\/monsters and I've seen several versions of Dracula before, my favorite the Francis Ford Copila version in my book but this film has a special place in my heart because it was the first (or one of if any other lost versions of Dracula are found)shot in bringing Dracula to the visual medium.There's not a whole lot I can really say about this film, it's pretty straight forward vampire film but done right. The orchastratic score that goes with it is great and fits with the grim dark atmosphere the film has. However it's the visuals in this film are just stunning and to me are what really have made it a classic.Of course the monster in the film Count Orlok is the star of the film and not hard to see why. That face of his truly is creepy and menacing, the make up work was really impressive and holds up to this day. This vampire is basically a humanoid bat creature, those eyes which look as though they could stare into your soul, pale white skin, big ears, sharp rat teeth, long fingers and nails, and the height of him which almost made him look like a giant. This character was simply a heartless beast whose goal was just to simply suck blood where ever and who ever he can find it. The way this character moves is also creepy because of how strange and varied the speed is, almost like some figure from your nightmares.But I feel the other star is simply the shadowy enviorment and the shadows that are always around Orlok. They really create a nightmarish dreamlike atmosphere my favorite enviorment set peace was no surprise Orlok's Castle which had all of the best places for shadows, and the look of it was simply menacing, creepy, gritty, which perfectly reflected Orlok's psyche. But also reinforce Orlock as a force of evil, the way he casts his shadow it is constantly growing tall and spreading trying to block out the light completely like a plague trying to spread. This of course gives some memorable visuals like my favorite one of Orlok creeping up the stairs toward a room, or his shadow creeping closer toward someone's bed.Well there's really nothing more to say, except beware of the shadows.Rating 4 stars ","genre":null},{"date":"14 October 2013","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" This is another film classic I really like; I remember seeing this literally for the first time at PLU (Pacific Lutheran Univercity) on a big screen at Olson Auditorium which is the concert hall.

It is a story about two young characters from rival gangs in New York City who fall in love with one another. It is a modern adaptation of the romantic tragedy, 'Romeo and Juliet'; there are a few differences in the two plots but a lot of similarities.When I first started to watch 'West Side Story' I didn't like it. I thought the beginning was very long and dragged out as the two rival groups danced in the middle of New York. The music and the dancing were very repetitive. It didn't really tell much about the story like other Romeo and Juliet stories would. There was no talking for the first fifteen minutes which I thought dragged it out even more. You didn't learn much about the characters like their names, why they were fighting or even where they were from. However you knew as soon as it begun that it was a musical, as the boys fought in the court yard the music went along with their actions. The first song sang then tells you a bit about the New York gang, how strong they are and how they won't let anyone take their ground.There are a lot of similar scenes in this Musical like there is in 'Romeo and Juliet', however in this story they use modern English and even some Spanish. There is a dance scene which is a lot like Zefirell's 1968 film. The dance scene is very colorful and it is where Tony and Maria meet for the first time, they dance and kiss but unfortunately Maria's brother does not like this and sends her home. Everyone dances in two circles like they did in Zefirell's version. There is also a version of the famous balcony scene in 'West Side Story' but with a modern twist, instead of Maria being on a balcony she is looking down at Tony from the fire escape stairs off her apartment block. I find this really interesting as it modernizes this scene up and since there is so many versions of the balcony scene out there it's just nice to see a bit different.There are very similar symbols in 'West Side Story' than there is in Zefirell's 'Romeo and Juliet'. Circles comes up a lot throughout both movies, at the very beginning of 'West Side Story' there is a bird's eye view of a child drawing circles on the ground in the basketball court where the two gangs first meet, we then see it again in the dance scene when the girls and boys dance in two circles this is exactly Zerfiell's dance scene. Another very common symbol is hands, throughout the musical we see Maria and Tony use their hands a lot to express their feelings. In the balcony scene they touch each other's hands and say how cold they are. Then when Tony is leaving they reach out their hands to each other as if they don't want to leave each other. The ending of 'West Side Story' is very much like the ending to 'Romeo and Juliet'. Riff gets killed by Bernard accidentally, Bernard is very shocked when it happens and you can see he regrets it as soon as it happens. This is just like when Tybalt kills Mercutio in 'Romeo and Juliet'. Then Tony kills Maria's brother Bernard, just like when Romeo kills Tybalt.I like the characters in this musical, Maria is played by Natalie Wood, Tony is played by Richard Beymar, Riff is played by Russ Tamblyn, Anita is played by Rita Moreno and Bernard is played by George Chakiris. They are good actors and fit the characters really well. I think they are all a good age to play this version of 'Romeo and Juliet'. They aren't as young as the cast Zefirell had for his film. I also quite liked the music in 'West Side Story' the songs were really good and catchy and told the story even better. I like the fact Robbins and Wise made this adaptation into a musical. Since there are so many versions of Romeo and Juliet out its nice to see a completely different way of watching it.In all I liked this film, I thought it was really interesting the way they had the Spanish gang and the NYC gang against each other.

I have had very little Streisand experience. Cineplex running the classic movies has been such a great experience for me. I am finally seeing these amazing iconic films that I keep saying I will see but never do. Funny Girl was...simply put...fantastic. Its a moving, often funny, sweet and touching romantic musical that absolutely showcases why it is such an iconic classic. The film is very long, much longer than I think it really needs to be. Its pretty stupid of me to even say something negative about a film that has withstood 40+ years and is loved by nearly everyone but I think the movie could have easily been edited to a much tidier 2 hours or less. There were a few scenes in the film (perhaps carried over from the Broadway play) that were simply unnecessary and felt that way. I definitely enjoyed the first part of the film more than the second but it also has many different tones throughout the movie as well. The start of the movie is more comedic, the songs are more upbeat and there are more of them. The latter half of the film is emotional, even sad at times and has less songs. Regardless this was a stunning romantic film that shows you just about every part of a passionate romance from beginning to end.The person who impressed me most in the film was Barbra Streisand. Her comedic timing was amazing and her performance was absolutely worthy of her Oscar. Fanny Brice is a down to earth girl raised in meagre surroundings with a low opinion of herself. She is also insanely talented and her brash, strong personality rockets her to stardom. She is riveting on screen and her charisma is absolutely undeniable. Not to be outdone Omar Sharif is also excellent. He is suave and cool and also lights up the screen. While it would seem that Streisand and Sharif are not a good match, their chemistry is terrific. Sharif is perfect for the role and his character is so flawed and goes through so much in the course of the film. There isn't a large supporting cast but there are definitely some performances worth mentioning. Kay Medford as Streisand's mother is a lot of fun in a small but noticeable role, Walter Pidgeon as the curmudgeonly theatre producer and Mae Questel as the hilarious and sly Mrs. Strakosh.Director William Wyler is a legend. He has so many classics under his belt that its clear he knows how to create a near masterpiece. I still think the film could have been edited better but Wyler tells his story without holding back any details. This is obviously a musical but at the same time, the songs aren't the driving force behind the story. They have a distinctive place in the film (most cases are while Fanny Brice is performing) and they don't overwhelm the film so even if you're not a huge fan of musicals but love classics then you can still enjoy this!! That being said I loved most of the songs and was perhaps only underwhelmed by that iconic People who need people song but maybe perhaps it was only because I was so amped to hear it for the first time in its original content. No matter how you look at it, I loved Funny Girl and loved seeing it on the big screen. If you are like me and had no experience with the Streisand of her day then do yourself a favour and watch this because you will understand a little about why she is such a legend. 9\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"14 October 2013","score":"","review":" For years I have heard of Barbra Streisand as an iconic and brilliant singer and actress but I can't honestly say that I've seen her in much.

I am finally seeing these amazing iconic films that I keep saying I will see but never do. Funny Girl was...simply put...fantastic. Its a moving, often funny, sweet and touching romantic musical that absolutely showcases why it is such an iconic classic. The film is very long, much longer than I think it really needs to be. Its pretty stupid of me to even say something negative about a film that has withstood 40+ years and is loved by nearly everyone but I think the movie could have easily been edited to a much tidier 2 hours or less. There were a few scenes in the film (perhaps carried over from the Broadway play) that were simply unnecessary and felt that way. I definitely enjoyed the first part of the film more than the second but it also has many different tones throughout the movie as well. The start of the movie is more comedic, the songs are more upbeat and there are more of them. The latter half of the film is emotional, even sad at times and has less songs. Regardless this was a stunning romantic film that shows you just about every part of a passionate romance from beginning to end.The person who impressed me most in the film was Barbra Streisand. Her comedic timing was amazing and her performance was absolutely worthy of her Oscar. Fanny Brice is a down to earth girl raised in meagre surroundings with a low opinion of herself. She is also insanely talented and her brash, strong personality rockets her to stardom. She is riveting on screen and her charisma is absolutely undeniable. Not to be outdone Omar Sharif is also excellent. He is suave and cool and also lights up the screen. While it would seem that Streisand and Sharif are not a good match, their chemistry is terrific. Sharif is perfect for the role and his character is so flawed and goes through so much in the course of the film. There isn't a large supporting cast but there are definitely some performances worth mentioning. Kay Medford as Streisand's mother is a lot of fun in a small but noticeable role, Walter Pidgeon as the curmudgeonly theatre producer and Mae Questel as the hilarious and sly Mrs. Strakosh.Director William Wyler is a legend. He has so many classics under his belt that its clear he knows how to create a near masterpiece. I still think the film could have been edited better but Wyler tells his story without holding back any details. This is obviously a musical but at the same time, the songs aren't the driving force behind the story. They have a distinctive place in the film (most cases are while Fanny Brice is performing) and they don't overwhelm the film so even if you're not a huge fan of musicals but love classics then you can still enjoy this!! That being said I loved most of the songs and was perhaps only underwhelmed by that iconic People who need people song but maybe perhaps it was only because I was so amped to hear it for the first time in its original content. No matter how you look at it, I loved Funny Girl and loved seeing it on the big screen. If you are like me and had no experience with the Streisand of her day then do yourself a favour and watch this because you will understand a little about why she is such a legend. 9\/10 ","genre":"Biography, Comedy, Drama"},{"date":"14 October 2013","score":"","review":" For years I have heard of Barbra Streisand as an iconic and brilliant singer and actress but I can't honestly say that I've seen her in much.

When I started watching his filmography, I was expecting everything, really, because I know people who've seen a lot of his movies and they were always telling me that his films are good, but extremely tough to watch. Especially Dancer in the Dark, a friend of mine said. So when I started watching it, I found out I was unprepared.Dancer in the Dark is a movie about Selma Jezkova (Björk), a factory worker from the '60s, who is slowly going blind. She has a genetic disease that she knows her 12-year old son will inherit, therefore she is saving up money so he can get an operation when he turns 13. She's extremely poor, she lives in a trailer she's renting from the town's policeman, Bill Houston (David Morse), who lives with his wife near Selma's trailer, and who is helping her with the money. Her only friends, Kathy (Catherine Deneuve) and Jeff (Peter Stormare) help her as well in her everyday-life routine. Everything starts to go downhill when the policeman doesn't have any more money to give her and, taking advantage of the fact that she's going completely blind, steals all the money that she saved up for her son's operation. That's when Selma starts to 'dance in the dark', both literally and metaphorically.Dancer in the Dark is the third film in the so-called Golden Heart trilogy by Lars von Trier. I don't really know why the trilogy's called like that, but I can assume it's because the main character is a pure-hearted person, whose life gets destroyed by the people that surround him (in this case &#x96; her) and by the situations he finds himself in. At least, that's Selma's story. I think von Trier's goal here was to rip your heart out of your chest, squeeze it and make it explode. He took something so pure, innocent and beautiful as Selma, and made her suffer as much as he could. And all that you can do, as a viewer, is just watch the main character perish. I suffered along with the character, and it was really difficult to watch. I usually spontaneously empathise with the character, I try to experience what they're experiencing &#x96; and that surely didn't help. At the end of the movie, I was a train wreck, crying my eyes out. But maybe, the movie's problem is just in this.The movie wasn't particularly well-received, especially by the critics, and I see why people don't like it. It's not a pleasant movie to watch; everything in it makes you feel uncomfortable, and especially mainstream audiences feel uncomfortable, since the movie is so unconventional. It's filmed by following almost all of the Dogme 95 rules it uses hand-held digital cameras to create a documentary-style look, with no background music. I didn't mind those characteristics, I actually loved them. What I think we all really agree on is that the real eye-candy of the movie is Björk. Her performance was outworldly, something unique in the history of cinema. Many said that Björk was so convincing that she became the character herself &#x96; and I agree with them. That wasn't acting, as her co-star Catherine Deneuve said that was feeling. And what's even better &#x96; Björk was able to use her main talent, music, in the movie as well Selma is a great musical fan, and she would often daydream, creating musical numbers in her head. In the movie, we would see what Selma imagined. The colors would brighten (this time using static cameras to film), Selma would be singing along with whoever surrounded her, and everything would be cheerful. The result of the combination of Björk's phenomenal voice and incredible acting performance was astonishing.But, as I was saying before, maybe the problem with the movie is that von Trier was using this 'destroying something beautiful' to get to the viewers. One could call it 'cheap storytelling', but isn't that the most effective way to get to someone's heart and then break it? Yes, it actually is. So, no, von Trier's masterplan here wasn't genius &#x96; he's just doing what he does best. But I don't really care. I don't think it's actually that easy to make someone feel such strong emotions. You've got to choose the right story, with the right characters (main and supporting), the right twists, the right directing, the right screenplay, the right tone and the right actors. Choosing Björk as the main character was a risk, since that was her first acting job. But her sweet, innocent appearance had an even greater effect on the whole movie experience, because it enhanced the beauty that was getting destroyed. I'm certain that the movie wouldn't have been this good without Björk's acting and music.So, personally, I loved the movie. I'm all for the emotions, and this one struck me good. But I loved everything about it its uniqueness in the way it's filmed and directed, the dark but sometimes cheerful tone, the characters and the actors, etc. The above mentioned problem that many had with the movie wasn't a problem for me at all. Maybe it was too raw and harsh, but Lars von Trier really got everything right, in my eyes. Some may call it tedious and overly-melodramatic, but I think it was all done on purpose. The initial slow pace created the right situations and the right tone, and the twists that happened later in the movie felt earned and right-timed. It all felt very real as well. When the final credits started running, and my tears started flowing like crazy, my first thought was F**k you, Lars. But then, it turned into a thank you, because, as a critic said, ultimately, it's a tribute to the power of cinema.

You've got to choose the right story, with the right characters (main and supporting), the right twists, the right directing, the right screenplay, the right tone and the right actors. Choosing Björk as the main character was a risk, since that was her first acting job. But her sweet, innocent appearance had an even greater effect on the whole movie experience, because it enhanced the beauty that was getting destroyed. I'm certain that the movie wouldn't have been this good without Björk's acting and music.So, personally, I loved the movie. I'm all for the emotions, and this one struck me good. But I loved everything about it its uniqueness in the way it's filmed and directed, the dark but sometimes cheerful tone, the characters and the actors, etc. The above mentioned problem that many had with the movie wasn't a problem for me at all. Maybe it was too raw and harsh, but Lars von Trier really got everything right, in my eyes. Some may call it tedious and overly-melodramatic, but I think it was all done on purpose. The initial slow pace created the right situations and the right tone, and the twists that happened later in the movie felt earned and right-timed. It all felt very real as well. When the final credits started running, and my tears started flowing like crazy, my first thought was F**k you, Lars. But then, it turned into a thank you, because, as a critic said, ultimately, it's a tribute to the power of cinema. ","genre":"Crime, Drama, Musical"},{"date":"14 October 2013","score":"4 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" After seeing Melancholia and Antichrist, and after reading lots of stuff about Lars von Trier and his movies, I thought I understood what kind of director he is. When I started watching his filmography, I was expecting everything, really, because I know people who've seen a lot of his movies and they were always telling me that his films are good, but extremely tough to watch. Especially Dancer in the Dark, a friend of mine said. So when I started watching it, I found out I was unprepared.Dancer in the Dark is a movie about Selma Jezkova (Björk), a factory worker from the '60s, who is slowly going blind. She has a genetic disease that she knows her 12-year old son will inherit, therefore she is saving up money so he can get an operation when he turns 13. She's extremely poor, she lives in a trailer she's renting from the town's policeman, Bill Houston (David Morse), who lives with his wife near Selma's trailer, and who is helping her with the money. Her only friends, Kathy (Catherine Deneuve) and Jeff (Peter Stormare) help her as well in her everyday-life routine. Everything starts to go downhill when the policeman doesn't have any more money to give her and, taking advantage of the fact that she's going completely blind, steals all the money that she saved up for her son's operation. That's when Selma starts to 'dance in the dark', both literally and metaphorically.Dancer in the Dark is the third film in the so-called Golden Heart trilogy by Lars von Trier. I don't really know why the trilogy's called like that, but I can assume it's because the main character is a pure-hearted person, whose life gets destroyed by the people that surround him (in this case &#x96; her) and by the situations he finds himself in. At least, that's Selma's story. I think von Trier's goal here was to rip your heart out of your chest, squeeze it and make it explode. He took something so pure, innocent and beautiful as Selma, and made her suffer as much as he could. And all that you can do, as a viewer, is just watch the main character perish. I suffered along with the character, and it was really difficult to watch. I usually spontaneously empathise with the character, I try to experience what they're experiencing &#x96; and that surely didn't help. At the end of the movie, I was a train wreck, crying my eyes out. But maybe, the movie's problem is just in this.The movie wasn't particularly well-received, especially by the critics, and I see why people don't like it. It's not a pleasant movie to watch; everything in it makes you feel uncomfortable, and especially mainstream audiences feel uncomfortable, since the movie is so unconventional. It's filmed by following almost all of the Dogme 95 rules it uses hand-held digital cameras to create a documentary-style look, with no background music. I didn't mind those characteristics, I actually loved them. What I think we all really agree on is that the real eye-candy of the movie is Björk. Her performance was outworldly, something unique in the history of cinema. Many said that Björk was so convincing that she became the character herself &#x96; and I agree with them. That wasn't acting, as her co-star Catherine Deneuve said that was feeling. And what's even better &#x96; Björk was able to use her main talent, music, in the movie as well Selma is a great musical fan, and she would often daydream, creating musical numbers in her head. In the movie, we would see what Selma imagined. The colors would brighten (this time using static cameras to film), Selma would be singing along with whoever surrounded her, and everything would be cheerful. The result of the combination of Björk's phenomenal voice and incredible acting performance was astonishing.But, as I was saying before, maybe the problem with the movie is that von Trier was using this 'destroying something beautiful' to get to the viewers. One could call it 'cheap storytelling', but isn't that the most effective way to get to someone's heart and then break it? Yes, it actually is. So, no, von Trier's masterplan here wasn't genius &#x96; he's just doing what he does best. But I don't really care. I don't think it's actually that easy to make someone feel such strong emotions.

After watching his previous film Pan's Labyrinth, I looked forward to watching The Devil's Backbone, however, for a Gothic-horror film I thought it wasn't up to his standard. The narrative of the story was actually good, but for a horror film there needed to be more to it. It felt a bit dull. In the first few scenes of the film you see the ghost Santi, but in good horror film, fear of the unknown is a key part of the horror. In The Devil's Backbone there wasn't that fear. Although the makeup and costume of Santi was very well done, I feel the audience don't fear him as much as Del Toro wished. I did however enjoyed the relationship between Carlos, the protagonist, and Jaime (the school bully). I liked the way they put their differences aside to fight a common enemy, and how they became the two leaders of the boys in the orphanage when fighting Jacinto. I also liked the mise-en-scene of the film, including its isolated location. The typical traits of a horror film including this are in the film, but it's not enough with just the traits. There needs to be something extra that keeps you on the edge of your seat. I did however like the dangerous scenery and props, for example the unexploded bomb in the middle of the courtyard. I wouldn't recommend this for the people who watch films for the scare, because it would probably be a waste of your time. However, if you are interested in a good plot in the Gothic genre without any scares then this would be a good film for you to watch, mainly because of the interesting relationships between many of the characters in the film, represented in many different ways. An example of this is the children being represented as vulnerable, backed up by the scene that they get captured by Jacinto. Overall I give this a 4\/10 mainly because of the fact that I think this is barely a horror film.

Namely false imprisonment and a psychotic fan actively preventing her prisoner from leaving. It seemed disturbing, but I decided to watch it anyway and discovered that it was not as disturbing as I thought it would be. What this movie does say, is what I see in a lot of Stephen King movies, and the books that I read, that horror goes far beyond nasty monster and lots of gore.A famous writer, Paul Sheldon (James Caan) finishes a book and leaves his retreat in the mountains in the middle of a blizzard and ends up crashing his car. He is then pulled from the wreckage by a passing nurse (Kathy Bates) who we first discover is a fan, and then learn that she had been stalking him. He at first believes that he is there recovering, but soon he comes to realise that he is not going to get out - especially since he killed off her favourite character in one of his books.What this movie explores is the dark, unseen side of the human psyche. We consider humanity to be generally nice, and prefer to ignore our darker side. Yet it is something that we cannot avoid with stories of horrid murders by apparently innocent people. Yet once they commit such an act, we ignore what drove them to do that act and label them as being bad. What we really ignore is that we are capable of being driven to that point at well.This is not the case in Misery. The woman has been twisted for a long time. We don't get to know her that well to know what caused her to go that way, but we do know that she has been married and the man whom she was married to was disappointing. We also soon discover some nasty secrets about her past, and maybe it was that which slowly drove her mind into the state that it is in, seeking the beauty of Sheldon's books to escape the reality of her true nature.What I like about Stephen King (and what people seem to ignore regarding his works) is that he explores the human psyche, and it is this that is truly horrific, especially since it is something that we choose to ignore. Many of us will say that no human can be like that, yet we look around and see that it is not true.

And to give credit where credit's due, Charade does resemble a typical Hitchcock picture in terms of its style and premise. They even got Cary Grant to star in this picture, who starred in many of Hitchcock's earlier pictures such as To Catch a Thief (1955), North by Northwest (1959), and Notorious (1946). Whether or not Charade is truly worthy of comparison to Hitchcock's best films remains to be seen. In the meantime, let's venture forth into the premise behind this picture that Hitchcock didn't make. A young lady named Reggie Lampert (Audrey Hepburn) has recently learned that her husband has been murdered. The only item in his possession in which the informants were able to recover was his travel bag which is filled with other various items. During his funeral, she notices three suspicious men (James Coburn, George Kennedy, and Ned Glass) attending to see the body simply to confirm that this person's dead. A CIA administrator (Walter Matthau) informs her that these three men are after the money that was in her husband's possession. He also informs her that her husband was with these men on an important mission to deliver $250,000 in gold to the French Resistance. But they all stole the gold, her husband double crossed these men, and he took all the gold for himself. Now this administrator tells her that not only do these three men want the money back, but so does the U.S. government. The administrator insists that Reggie has possession of the money, but she doesn't know where it is. So these three men are now coming after her to retrieve her husband's wealth. A stranger named Peter Joshua (Cary Grant) helps her out with her dilemma. But not only does he need to know where the money is, he may or may not have been involved with the other three men and her husband in their mission. It's important to note that Stanley Donen, the director of this film, was best known for directing such beloved musicals as Singin' in the Rain (1952), Seven Brides for Seven Brothers (1954), and On the Town (1949). With a resume like that, you wouldn't expect a director like Donen to be able to do justice in replicating a Hitchcock picture. But somehow even with his inexperience with Hitchcockian type thrillers, he gets Hitchcock's style down very well here. It helps that the plot to Charade bares many similarities to such Hitchcock classics as To Catch a Thief and North by Northwest. Chief among these similarities being that the main character is trying to evade someone or some people after them for something they didn't do, and finding love with someone along the way whom they can and can't trust. The dilemma that Reggie gets into is relentless between the three guys interrogating her for information regarding her husband's fortune and Peter's many secrets that he's keeping from her. I admire how well she handles all of this madness that suddenly occurs in her life as a result of her husband's actions. Because of the way she handles this whole situation to the best of her ability, we're able to have an easier time sympathizing with her. And although he lies to her more than once, Peter is also worthy of sympathy as well. Without revealing any more about his character, we sympathize with him and the lies he has to tell because he has no other option in terms of helping Reggie out. Are the antagonists in this film memorable in any way? I'm afraid not, since they're pretty basic character wise and are simply there to progress the story and nothing more. Are there a few scenes that put the film to a halt or slow it down at least? Yes, one scene that comes to mind is when Reggie is conversing with Peter and they literally talk about the movie An American in Paris (1951) for whatever reason. In the end, I'm not ready to consider Charade a great film yet mainly because it didn't quite blow my mind like some of Hitchcock's best work. I think it could have ended earlier and gotten to the point a tad faster, but that's just me. Any hardcore Hitchcock fans who see Charade will find plenty of things to admire about it, mainly how closely it resembles the work of the Master of Suspense himself.

During his funeral, she notices three suspicious men (James Coburn, George Kennedy, and Ned Glass) attending to see the body simply to confirm that this person's dead. A CIA administrator (Walter Matthau) informs her that these three men are after the money that was in her husband's possession. He also informs her that her husband was with these men on an important mission to deliver $250,000 in gold to the French Resistance. But they all stole the gold, her husband double crossed these men, and he took all the gold for himself. Now this administrator tells her that not only do these three men want the money back, but so does the U.S. government. The administrator insists that Reggie has possession of the money, but she doesn't know where it is. So these three men are now coming after her to retrieve her husband's wealth. A stranger named Peter Joshua (Cary Grant) helps her out with her dilemma. But not only does he need to know where the money is, he may or may not have been involved with the other three men and her husband in their mission. It's important to note that Stanley Donen, the director of this film, was best known for directing such beloved musicals as Singin' in the Rain (1952), Seven Brides for Seven Brothers (1954), and On the Town (1949). With a resume like that, you wouldn't expect a director like Donen to be able to do justice in replicating a Hitchcock picture. But somehow even with his inexperience with Hitchcockian type thrillers, he gets Hitchcock's style down very well here. It helps that the plot to Charade bares many similarities to such Hitchcock classics as To Catch a Thief and North by Northwest. Chief among these similarities being that the main character is trying to evade someone or some people after them for something they didn't do, and finding love with someone along the way whom they can and can't trust. The dilemma that Reggie gets into is relentless between the three guys interrogating her for information regarding her husband's fortune and Peter's many secrets that he's keeping from her. I admire how well she handles all of this madness that suddenly occurs in her life as a result of her husband's actions. Because of the way she handles this whole situation to the best of her ability, we're able to have an easier time sympathizing with her. And although he lies to her more than once, Peter is also worthy of sympathy as well. Without revealing any more about his character, we sympathize with him and the lies he has to tell because he has no other option in terms of helping Reggie out. Are the antagonists in this film memorable in any way? I'm afraid not, since they're pretty basic character wise and are simply there to progress the story and nothing more. Are there a few scenes that put the film to a halt or slow it down at least? Yes, one scene that comes to mind is when Reggie is conversing with Peter and they literally talk about the movie An American in Paris (1951) for whatever reason. In the end, I'm not ready to consider Charade a great film yet mainly because it didn't quite blow my mind like some of Hitchcock's best work. I think it could have ended earlier and gotten to the point a tad faster, but that's just me. Any hardcore Hitchcock fans who see Charade will find plenty of things to admire about it, mainly how closely it resembles the work of the Master of Suspense himself.

And to give credit where credit's due, Charade does resemble a typical Hitchcock picture in terms of its style and premise. They even got Cary Grant to star in this picture, who starred in many of Hitchcock's earlier pictures such as To Catch a Thief (1955), North by Northwest (1959), and Notorious (1946). Whether or not Charade is truly worthy of comparison to Hitchcock's best films remains to be seen. In the meantime, let's venture forth into the premise behind this picture that Hitchcock didn't make. A young lady named Reggie Lampert (Audrey Hepburn) has recently learned that her husband has been murdered. The only item in his possession in which the informants were able to recover was his travel bag which is filled with other various items.
