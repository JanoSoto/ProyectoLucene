I actually surprisingly much liked it and the movie really made me laugh numerous times! It's a comedy done Mel Brooks-style. So lots of the humor is being very simplistic and childish and all of the characters are being very over-the-top and crazy. Obviously not a movie to take serious in any way and it's not really being one that tries to make sense with its story. No big surprise this movie feels Mel Brooks like, since director Rudy De Luca has written on a couple of Mel Brooks movies. Not Brooks his best ones though, needs to be said.It really are the actors and all of its funny one-liners that make this movie such a joy to watch. You can tell that most of the actors were improvising their way through this movie and especially Michael Richards was on a roll with it. His antics really made me laugh. While watching this movie it's obvious to see how how much fun the actors were having with this movie. This is also really what helps to make this movie such an enjoyable one to watch, even though it's really not being a great movie by any means.It has quite some well known names in it but some suit their roles better than others. I mean, I'm sorry but I just never saw Ed Begley Jr. as a good comedy actor. Jeff Goldblum, Carol Kane and Jeffrey Jones on the other hand are for instance some great picks for their roles.They present a plot in this movie but does it really matter? The movie really isn't about its story and once you actually start analyzing it, it is quite a bad and unoriginal story, that doesn't even make sense. I mean, didn't the film-makers know that the Frankenstein creature doesn't come from Transylvania at all and also has nothing to do with it at all. But oh well, I understand that Transylvania has a more familiar ring to it than Vasaria. And there still is a vampire in this movie as well, as is a wolf man. So plenty of well known horror material present in this movie that gets spoofed.Really too bad that the movie doesn't manage to remain consistently funny and entertaining throughout. It's last half hour or so just isn't up to par with the rest of the movie, probably because they suddenly started to focus more on its plot and story at that point. You could easily do without its last half hour but be sure to watch the first hour though, when you're in for some good silly laughs.It ain't no Young Frankenstein but it's more than good and funny in its own way!7\/10http\/\/bobafett1138.blogspot.com\/ ","genre":null},{"date":"21 April 2011","score":"4 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" Seems like this movie is a case of you'll either love it or hate it.

We even have the return of the split-screen shot that worked so well in Phantom of the Paradise (though less dramatic here).The film opens with Angie Dickinson naked in the shower. Luckily, in the Angie Dickinson shower scene, a body double is used. Her breasts and other woman parts are fully exposed and very graphic, very sexual... it really hurt me to see such an ugly old woman with a beautiful body... and then we again see her (this time for real) topless in a car... oh my! The film as a whole is very sexy, very hot, especially for 1980. It is tantalizing, sensual, erotic, every adjective you can throw at it. The music by Pino Donaggio (a DePalma regular) just brought this to a head. And starring Michael Caine? Perfection.Some other interesting things are brought up that might take a second or third viewing to really appreciate -- the sex change television program, the venereal disease papers in the desk... some of the twists are fairly obvious, but the nuances are something more.Howard Maxford goes so far as to say this is arguably DePalma's best film... which blows my mind. Is it good? Yes. Great? Probably... but is it as great as Scarface? I do not know... that is quite a leap. But it sure gives Carrie a run for its money.

Ridley Scott hand carved this monster in space epic from almost nothing, a fairly limp script and a budget that required some imagination. Scott delivered on every front and made this classic that I believe will live on well after Hollywood does a shoddy remake of it.The manages suspense like no other, its music is so haunting and mellow that it murmurs beneath the surface until its ready to pounce. The pace is uncomfortable speed, in its first half very little happens and though it doesn't drag it pulls you along giving you just enough interest to keep you attached, but keeping the audience at an arms length to make u feel like you are a peeping tom, all the more creepy. The famous chest bursting sequence is where the film really kicks off and literally drives into a speed at which is relentless and horrifying.The scenery in the film is just stunning. From Gigers towering and disturbing Alien set pieces to claustrophobic nostromo. Every inch of the film is thought through superbly, the scenery and the lighting and the music compliment every aspect as the film goes on. Sigourney Weaver is nothing short of amazing, her first major role was one that she would be remembered for forever. Ripley is the quintessential female action hero, a tough as nails captain that displays a ferocious side, but at the same time has a warmth and nurturing aspect that makes her oh so likable.Alien's four sequels (I'm excluding Alien Vs Predator)all attempt a new take on the original film. The sequel Aliens captures something new, but retains the same feel of the original. Some argue it as better than Alien, but I disagree, Alien is unbelievably refined and well done, whereas Aliens offers a staggering action caper with a great weighted drama as well. Alien 3 is the major miss step in the franchise, but it still has some merit. And Alien Resurrection tries something new and half achieves its goal, but I can't help thinking they could have gone further with it.Alien is incredible, a classic film that all should see. And though not to everyones taste it is undeniable that this film has stood the test of time because its so damn good.
