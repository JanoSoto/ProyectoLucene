When I saw it the second time two years later I laughed myself sick. The third time around, one more year gone by, I could hardly wait to see it again. To know this film was a masterpiece was not difficult, already the first time. To feel it, though, required the second time. It just physically works that way. The camera takes in so much with each shot, you can't keep up with it. And it's not simply that there are too many details in each and every composition. More than that, it's the difficulty of taking them all in digestion-wise. All the small pieces of information you may gather from watching add to an extremely dark view of the world. 'Mister Andersson' planned it all very carefully. It's like he was really-really fed up with everything in the matrix, you know, and decided to let his anger go by preparing for years for every single destructive shot included in the 'movie' (movie is not a really appropriate word, since it's rather static in fact), so that he could reveal the most about the ugliness he saw around himself. He invites you to a corner at some party you may not have enjoyed anyway, to a corner from which you can see all those present at the same time, and then he shows you how all those people around kill, maim and torture each other. And, to get you even more desperate, he also points out the strings attached to them they are all puppets on strings, you see, they are doing what they are doing because their characters and their whole lives are structured in a given way stemming from reasons beyond anyone individually. Then he finally gives you some consolation by somehow putting what you see into an angle from which you can't help but laugh, not really cruelly, because it's about your own fate, too. It's just the emergency exit for the mind, for which the safest way out is delving into something totally different after watching this twisted reality show.

The classic 1963 It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World was due to be updated, and in my opinion, this is a fair update. One of the things that made MMMM World work was its huge assemblage of popular talent and comics, even small cameos. Here, you have a small group and very few added characters to the chase. In the original, lots of gags that hit every time; here, you have hits and misses, almost as many misses as you have hits. The Nazi Barbie Museum and the heart being the two biggest misses. Another big miss was when the two brothers ended up in the big wheel rally, and realized a big wheel truck was about to pound on them, they scattered out the car door, which took more time to do than simply put the car in gear and drive away from where they parked. The mumble-mouthed brother could have been in reference to Buddy Hacket's vocal style in the original movie, but if so, I think it's insulting.But with all its faults, RAT RACE is still a funny movie -- a one-timer for me -- with my favorite scene being the helicopter girl flies over her boyfriend's house. I haven't laughed so hard since Airplane! My favorite line was when after John Cleese told them Go! and everyone's still seated, he says, All of you have been racing for 45 seconds, and this guy is in the lead because he's the closest to the door.

Dark room, people whispering or making out in the corner, dull movie this class was normally known as Nap Time, but not that day. In went the tape and out came a story full of vivacity, charm, hilarity and heart.The story is of a girl, Viola, who loses her brother and disguises herself as him to find work. She falls in love with the Duke, who has sent her to woo a countess by the name of Olivia, who has lost her brother as well. Of course, Olivia falls in love with Viola, thinking she is a young man. Viola now must reject one love because she is a woman and be rejected by another love that believes she is a man. What to do? Throw more people into the mix! Olivia, being a countess and therefore rich as anything, has no lack of other admirers from the insanely stupid Sir Andrew Aguecheeck that her uncle encourages for sport to her pious steward, Malvolio. Each person vies for her attentions while she goes insane over the one man she cannot have. Enter Sebastian, Viola's twin brother who *gasp* didn't die after all. Much confusion and laughter later, Viola is finally able to shed her masculine usurped attire and profess her love for the now-frazzled Duke. Don't worry about Olivia, she gets to keep a copy, the ever-willing Sebastian.Watching this movie the first time, I could hardly believe it was written 400 years ago. The story relates flawlessly to a modern audience. Watching it for the hundredth time after I bought it, I am still captivated by the genius adaption. The script is so funny and intertwines plot lines seamlessly. The actors actually know what they are trying to say, which is half of conveying the meaning of the difficult language. Even if I did not understand every word, I would get the meaning with help from the incredible acting.Imogene Stubbs is beautiful as Viola- she really makes a very cute, albeit effeminate boy. I felt the most for her, especially when she tells the Duke the story of her love for him under the guise of a sister. Toby Stephens as the Duke was quite handsome, and made the character more likable. If it had been another person, I would have wondered what in the world Viola saw in the whiny, fanciful man, but he was quite suave and charming.Olivia-Bonham-Carter shone as the almost bi-polar Olivia. She snapped from the pit of despair to the heights of love within a scene, but invited you to laugh with her in giddiness rather than snort in disbelief.Ben Kingsly was perfection as Feste, probably the best performance of the movie. He was a fool, but he knew it. He gave a performance of simple farce with a current of keen insight underneath.The others, Mel Smith, Imelda Staunton, Nigel Hawthorne, Richard Grant, Steven Mackintosh and Nicholas Farrell all provided excellent comedic support, tinged with the faintest hint of melancholy that brought just the right mix.Whether you're a fan of Shakespeare or not, Twelfth Night is without a doubt an amazing experience. It brings laughter, excitement and maybe even a misty eye with each viewing. Go rent it if you haven't seen it and if you have, pull it out and treat yourself tonight. I know I will.

Two and a half hours later and, although I have not emerged as a real convert, I will admit that I enjoyed the movie more than I had expected to.Dicken's classic tale of a young orphan who travels to London to find his fortune, but who instead becomes involved with a gang of pickpockets, is given a lavish musical overhaul by director Carol Reed. I'm not sure how faithful an adaptation of the book it is, but if spectacular song and dance numbers are your thing, then you sure aren't going to be disappointed by this film; impressive choreography and memorable tunes make Oliver! both a feast for the eyes and ears.The ever reliable Ron Moody and Oliver Reed give memorable performances as streetwise thieves Fagin and Bill Sykes, whilst Jack Wild is impressive as über-urchin The Artful Dodger. Shani Wallis ably plays likable tart-with-a-heart Nancy, and several other familiar British faces fill out the smaller roles with aplomb.In fact, it is only Mark Lester as Oliver who lets things down a bit compared with his co-stars, his performance is weak. Lester's Oliver is extremely lifeless compared to the other colourful characters he shares the screen with (I thought his singing voice was weak too, but have since learnt that it was dubbed by a woman). It's hard to believe such a wet-blanket could survive a poorhouse, travel solo to London, and survive on its mean streets.Towards the end the film becomes a lot darker in tone, with poor old Nancy coming a cropper at the hands of nasty Sykes, and it also manages to throw in a doozy of a coincidence the kindly rich man who takes Oliver into his home turns out to be his Uncle (now what are the chances of that happening?).At 153 minutes, the film is about half-an-hour too long&#151;one can only take so many dancing Cockney's before the novelty wears thin&#151;but even so, Oliver! is worth giving a go.

Nevertheless, everything in it is done well enough to make this a good (enough) genre movie to watch.The movie is needlessly told as a flashback, which also makes us the viewers already aware of how the main story ends, in advance. Sometimes in cases this approach works well for a story but not for such a mediocre movie as this one I'm afraid.In the midst of all the formulaic drama there are some fine actors in the movie, that get to shine. Elizabeth Taylor is really great and to me she was the one that truly carried the movie, though in screen time it is perhaps Van Johnson who plays the real main role of the movie. The movie also has a supporting cast to die for; Walter Pidgeon, Donna Reed, Eva Gabor and even a young Roger Moore in his first real notable movie role. I just wish that some of the character development would had been better though. Also the 'relationship' between Charles Wills and Marion Ellswirth never gets developed well enough, though it plays an essential part in all of the drama in the movie, especially in the beginning and toward the ending of the movie.The movie is really typical for MGM '50's standards, meaning that the drama is heavy but the approach of it isn't always. The movie at times tends to be more cheerful than dramatic, which isn't always for the movie its own benefits. Toward the end the drama thickens, which especially gives the movie its 'overdone' feeling, which also doesn't exactly make the movie more believable to watch. It's still a good enough drama to watch, just not one that will grab you.The movie uses some fine settings. Of course Paris is the perfect backdrop for a romantic movie and they used some nice locations in the movie (not the Eiffel tower for a change, even though it's still featured on the movie its cover). Also the costumes are quite nice.Good enough for its genre and MGM '50's standards but that doesn't exactly mean that it's a highly recommendable one though.6\/10http\/\/bobafett1138.blogspot.com\/ ","genre":null},{"date":"30 March 2007","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" This is your typical average overdone MGM drama, with a sappy story and a fluffy look and feel all over it.
