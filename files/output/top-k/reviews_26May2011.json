It is directed by Martin Campbell, first of the two Bond films he made, and stars for the first time Pierce Brosnan as 007.The film opens with James Bond on a mission with his fellow agent Alec Trevelyan, to destroy a Soviet chemical factory. Alec is killed by a ruthless General Ourumov but Bond still manages to complete the mission. Nine years later Bond discovers that Ourumov is working with a criminal syndicate Janus to steal GoldenEye satellite that can be used to cause electromagnetic pulse to destroy any machinery. Bond follows leads to Russia, only to discover not-so-dead Alec Trevelyan as the head of Janus and planning his revenge on England.This is the first Bond film made in a time when the wall of Berlin and Soviet Union no longer existed, and it raised a question how well the character would work. Well, if there is something director Martin Campbell proved with this film and later with Casino Royale, it's that he can update a character. Bond is still Bond, the charming spy who is always there for the Queen and the country. Just because world changed doesn't mean he is no longer needed. In a typical Bond movie fashion, the movie has no lack of action. My favorite scene would have to be the one where Bond drives a tank through the streets of St. Petersburg.Pierce Brosnan's take on the Bond seems to be a mix of Timothy Dalton's serious professionalism and Roger Moore's witty comebacks. While he's not my favorite Bond he does play the part well and never goes too campy with it (even if the movies did go). Isabella Scorupco gives a good support as Natalya Simonova, a programmer who gets thrown into action against her own will. Sean Bean seems to have fun playing Alec, one of the best and most unique Bond villains, as no other villain had ever been Bond's friend. Deliciously wicked Famke Janssen plays Alec's henchwoman Xenia Onatopp, who gets sexually aroused by killing. Both of them completely overshadow Gottfried John as General Ourumov.In minor parts we have Judi Dench as the first female M in the series, and quite possibly, the best M as well. Samantha Bond takes over the role of Miss Moneypenny and former Bond villain Joe Don Baker plays CIA agent Jack Wade, a wise-ass been there done that guy who is clearly replacing Felix Leiter. Robbie Coltrane makes a nice cameo as former KGB agent Valentin Zukovsky and Alan Cumming steals every scene he's in as the invincible programmer Boris.GoldenEye is the best Bond film of the 90's and a fantastic start for a new time in Bond movies.

Perhaps it was its interesting cast list or the fact I'm often interest in spy thriller but anyway, in the end this just wasn't a very satisfying. It's not one that is horrible or even bad but it really isn't a very exciting or engaging movie to watch.This is a movie with way too much talking and not even happening. I at least expected one action or chase sequences in this movie but there is absolutely nothing remotely like that in this movie at all. Of course it's alright for a movie to not feature any action in it and to be one that's all about its dialog and story instead but you still have to somehow manage to present and bring it in an interesting package, which just wasn't the case with this movie.To put it boldly, I just couldn't care less about any of the characters or what was going on with its story. Because of that, this movie just isn't ever a very involving one to watch. It will make you loose interest pretty fast, which makes this movie a bit of a dull one. There are some directors that can get away with telling a story like this in a way this movie does (someone like Michael Mann for instance) but just not a person like John Boorman I'm afraid. Seems to me that this movie would had worked out way better if they made it just a tad bit more entertaining to watch.John Boorman often sound good in potential but the execution is always lacking, even for his most respected and well known movies.

With the Al Pacino and John Cazale's tandem back on the road, proving their immense versatility as you totally forget that one year before, in a no less prestigious crime film, Al knew it was John, and gave him the kiss of death in an immortal movie scene &#x85; Dog Day Afternoon is a thrilling, captivating, and exhilarating experience honoring the zany unpredictability of life. Just when you think you had enough of surprises, something comes to shock, amuse, or disorient you. It's like a sitcom structured by a solid narrative and driven by an amazing Oscar winning script, full of priceless one-liners. And the film inspires so many emotions you wonder if this will have a happy or a sad ending. It's both tragic and comic, sometimes heart-breaking, sometimes hilarious. Like Sonny's ridiculous over-cautiousness to find out that there's no money and worse, that police was already waiting from outside. Not to mention the way he struggled to get the rifle out of the flower-box, the third accomplice who chickened out... from the beginning, the job was so amateurish both the hostages and the audience wondered what was going on. The movie opens with the realism of Serpico and a nut that'll be very hard to crack, somewhat like 12 Angry Men's verdict, and a character so sympathetic, while realizing it will be a very long day&#x85; Sympathetic but not pathetic... progressively, there's a revelation. Sonny Wortzik is more than a clumsy bank robber the guy has nerves, a heart, he acts tough, but is put in his place when he curses. He definitely doesn't want anyone to get hurt. And the genius of the script is Sal. He literally 'salted' the film giving it that thriller flavor, with his scary look and eagerness to kill anyone. John Cazale totally embodies the idea of a man who has nothing to lose, and doesn't want to go to jail. With this ticking bomb of a character, we know it can go wrong at any time. And Sonny's job is to keep Sal calm inside, when he has other business to deal with outside.Sonny is indeed the cinematic incarnation of the man who tries to keep everything on control. His memorable interactions with Sgt. Moretti, Charles Durning in a remarkable performance, even highlight the evolution of this character who, from self-confidence and condescending tone becomes more fatherly towards Sonny, as if he was mirroring Sonny's very psychological situation, trying to keep things cool while cops were all targeting the bank and the crowd coming to watch the show. A modern circus show with Al as the biggest star, and the media as the lions coming to devour him. And what a showman that Sonny! One of the greatest performances from Al Pacino who gives to his character a moral and political dimension forever incarnated by the immortal Attica! Attica!. A general and cheerful Stockholm Syndrome, he wins the people's hearts and ours with one of the most legendary rally cries evoking a lost era where people had the guts to stand for their beliefs. Dog Day Afternoon is one of the most-defining films of the 70's, with a rebellious mind, and a heart too &#x85;And God, the heart of the film... when you expect, you had all the surprises; the best is to come when we learn why Sonny robbed the bank with the entrance of Leon, his 'wife', portrayed in a nuanced but powerful performance by Chris Sarandon as a woman trapped in a man's body. Yep, the movie is full of strong supporting performances. Chris is so convincing we feel this tender love and complicity that could inspire Sonny the desperate idea to rob a bank to pay for his lover's sex change. A complicity translated by the legendary improvised phone-call scene, which genuinely contrasts with the noisier one with Sonny's official (and talkative) wife. These are the elements that placed Sonny Wortzik among the most fascinating characters of cinema's history and made Pacino a legend, with a character who couldn't have been more different than the icy and cold-blooded Michael Corleone. The story provides him a human touch, he's got a life, a wife, a lover, and he lives and leaves them with such intensity we lose the control of the film. We were laughing, now we feeling Sonny's pain as he's dealing with this tragicomedy, his loss of control and of the people's sympathy after his homosexuality was revealed. Al Pacino's eyes burn with an intensity crystallizing an out of control situation. It's dark, sweaty, we can hardly breathe, and the claustrophobic feeling transcends the bank, even the film. The film which concludes as it started, in an abrupt, detached and cold way. The police kills Sal and Sonny begs for life.

And the film inspires so many emotions you wonder if this will have a happy or a sad ending. It's both tragic and comic, sometimes heart-breaking, sometimes hilarious. Like Sonny's ridiculous over-cautiousness to find out that there's no money and worse, that police was already waiting from outside.

Sonny Wortzik is more than a clumsy bank robber the guy has nerves, a heart, he acts tough, but is put in his place when he curses. He definitely doesn't want anyone to get hurt. And the genius of the script is Sal. He literally 'salted' the film giving it that thriller flavor, with his scary look and eagerness to kill anyone. John Cazale totally embodies the idea of a man who has nothing to lose, and doesn't want to go to jail. With this ticking bomb of a character, we know it can go wrong at any time. And Sonny's job is to keep Sal calm inside, when he has other business to deal with outside.Sonny is indeed the cinematic incarnation of the man who tries to keep everything on control. His memorable interactions with Sgt. Moretti, Charles Durning in a remarkable performance, even highlight the evolution of this character who, from self-confidence and condescending tone becomes more fatherly towards Sonny, as if he was mirroring Sonny's very psychological situation, trying to keep things cool while cops were all targeting the bank and the crowd coming to watch the show. A modern circus show with Al as the biggest star, and the media as the lions coming to devour him. And what a showman that Sonny! One of the greatest performances from Al Pacino who gives to his character a moral and political dimension forever incarnated by the immortal Attica! Attica!. A general and cheerful Stockholm Syndrome, he wins the people's hearts and ours with one of the most legendary rally cries evoking a lost era where people had the guts to stand for their beliefs. Dog Day Afternoon is one of the most-defining films of the 70's, with a rebellious mind, and a heart too &#x85;And God, the heart of the film... when you expect, you had all the surprises; the best is to come when we learn why Sonny robbed the bank with the entrance of Leon, his 'wife', portrayed in a nuanced but powerful performance by Chris Sarandon as a woman trapped in a man's body. Yep, the movie is full of strong supporting performances. Chris is so convincing we feel this tender love and complicity that could inspire Sonny the desperate idea to rob a bank to pay for his lover's sex change. A complicity translated by the legendary improvised phone-call scene, which genuinely contrasts with the noisier one with Sonny's official (and talkative) wife. These are the elements that placed Sonny Wortzik among the most fascinating characters of cinema's history and made Pacino a legend, with a character who couldn't have been more different than the icy and cold-blooded Michael Corleone. The story provides him a human touch, he's got a life, a wife, a lover, and he lives and leaves them with such intensity we lose the control of the film. We were laughing, now we feeling Sonny's pain as he's dealing with this tragicomedy, his loss of control and of the people's sympathy after his homosexuality was revealed. Al Pacino's eyes burn with an intensity crystallizing an out of control situation. It's dark, sweaty, we can hardly breathe, and the claustrophobic feeling transcends the bank, even the film. The film which concludes as it started, in an abrupt, detached and cold way. The police kills Sal and Sonny begs for life. He didn't want to betray Sal, but in a way, he was so alienated by the whole craziness of the situation, he lost the control and didn't even realize how nuts he's gone, like wondering one minute before his arrest if he'll have food in the plane, or believing he was really going to Algeria.

They have a daughter, Bernice (Mae Whitman). When Birdee is invited on a talk show, she is led to believe it's for a makeover. However, it's a Jerry Springer type show, and when she gets there, her best friend tells her that she's been having an affair with Birdee's husband - and they're in love. Bill verifies it.Angry and hurt, Birdee packs up her daughter and moves back to Texas with her outspoken taxidermist mother (Gena Rowlands). An old flame (Harry Connick Jr.) reappears, but Birdee is unable to move forward. She's in love with her husband and wants him back.This film seems to have low scores on IMDb, giving validation to my theory that a) reviewers on IMDb are mostly men; and b) young men; who c) like action, special effects, futuristic, and science fiction films.Hope Floats is actually a very sweet movie with lovely performances from everyone involved. Bullock is warm and likable as a depressed woman who comes back to town in disgrace and has to face up to people she wasn't particularly nice to in high school. Connick is handsome and charming. Rowlands does a terrific job as Birdee's confident and sometimes overbearing mother who deeply loves her daughter and granddaughter. Mae Whitman as the child Bernice is fantastic as a hurt little girl waiting for her daddy to take her home.Some of the best scenes occur when Birdee visits her demented father in a nursing home.I thought this was an effective film. No bombs, no violence, just some poignant real life - a single mom, a father with dementia, and what it's like to go home and start over.I love films like Speed, Inception, Salt and films of the classic era.

Serpent? Well, just the voodoo aspect, and both films came out about the same time -- this being the better of the two (sorry Wes Craven).I have seen reviews calling this the creepiest performance of Robert DeNiro's career. I will not agree or disagree, but accept it as possible. I mean, I do not normally think of him as a creeper, so what do I compare this to -- Cape Fear, I guess. Or Little Fockers.Roger Ebert says director Parker's films are always made with great gusto, as if he were in up to his elbows and taking no hostages -- he uses The Wall as an example, which is nothing like this film, but they both do have an intensity that any moviegoer ought to appreciate. Ultimately, Ebert calls the film an exuberant exercise in style and gives it a bold three and a half stars... I am hesitant to match that, leaning more towards a solid three.

Well, just the voodoo aspect, and both films came out about the same time -- this being the better of the two (sorry Wes Craven).I have seen reviews calling this the creepiest performance of Robert DeNiro's career. I will not agree or disagree, but accept it as possible. I mean, I do not normally think of him as a creeper, so what do I compare this to -- Cape Fear, I guess. Or Little Fockers.Roger Ebert says director Parker's films are always made with great gusto, as if he were in up to his elbows and taking no hostages -- he uses The Wall as an example, which is nothing like this film, but they both do have an intensity that any moviegoer ought to appreciate. Ultimately, Ebert calls the film an exuberant exercise in style and gives it a bold three and a half stars... I am hesitant to match that, leaning more towards a solid three. But yes, this is that rare good movie that gets overlooked by the target audience.

His wife and her brother know nothing about Karl's big secret, even after a big incident where many lights in a part of London were turned off, but there are worse things to happen than that.

Ackroyd plays Louis Winthrope III, an executive at the commodities brokerage house Duke & Duke. He lives in an enormous house and has a butler (Denholm Elliott). He's also engaged to the niece of his bosses, Randolph and Mortimer Duke (Ralph Bellamy and Don Ameche). Life is good.

Thus, Winthorpe is accused of being a drug dealer and a thief and loses his job, his club membership, his house, and the butler pretends he doesn't know who he is. Winthorpe finds help and solace with a prostitute (Jamie Lee Curtis) as he tries to figure out how to get his life back. Billy Ray, meanwhile, is given all the things that Winthorpe had.Murphy is hilarious as Billy Ray, particularly when he's on the street -you've probably seen his classic scene with the cops even if you haven't seen the movie. Ackroyd - well, you just feel awful for him - he is just so pathetic. And those Dukes! It's so fantastic to see Bellamy and Ameche in this film.

This IFO, it's not unidentified since it's pretty obvious this is a plate, is Edward D. Wood Jr., and Ed Wood one of the most surprisingly pleasant films of the last 20 years and probably, but that's my personal opinion, Tim Burton's masterpiece.The film works on the primary level of a well-directed biographical comedy. I expected some good laughs I laughed. I expected to know more about the Worst Director of All-Time I can say now, that the film grabbed my curiosity enough to make me check about Ed Wood, and his legacy has no secret for me anymore. And I expected a dazzling black and white cinematography handled by Tim Burton's magic direction, and well, my eyes were pleased too. Ed Wood is a visual, self-reflexive, homage to the Golden Age of B-movies, where cinema was still a creative laboratory with no providential help from technology and 3D effects, a time when visual effects could be disastrous, or unintentionally hilarious.Now, what I didn't expect was how I would be moved by the story. Ed Wood is more than a comedy or a biopic, it's an inspirational tribute to the devotion one can have for his work. It's about loving what we do, and enjoying it so intensely that any sensation your passion procures is thrilling. This 'living one's passion' aspect, incarnated by Johnny Depp's childish expression and constantly sparkling eyes, drew a big smile on my face encouraging me to approach my life differently. But the more touching facet driving the movie is the heart-breaking friendship between Ed Wood and the horror icon Bela Lugosi, at the nadir of his career. It's a somewhat sad running gag that many people think Lugosi's dead, as to highlight how Ed Wood literally resurrected him. This friendship is the heart of the film.And both Wood's dedication to his work, his profound respect and admiration to Lugosi incarnate the simple, but so overlooked, idea that love is what drives our lives. Ed Wood did films, managed to get people motivated and convinced they were doing something good, because his passion was communicative. When his pals were complaining about the harshness of a critic, he reassures them like a good and gentle man, in fact, he never talks negatively except during these moments of doubt he shares with his girlfriend, like some flashes of realization that desert him as soon as he remembers his personal dream  to be the next Orson Welles. And this positive mindset is the rainbow lighting Lugosi's bitter heart after years of stormy lows and a painful drug-addiction. I was blown away by Landau's performance Martin Landau was the legendary Dracula's player even in the most unnoticeable mimics, looks, and majestic explosions of anger when the taboo 'Karloff' word was mentioned ... one of the most powerful supporting performances of the 90's, well deserving its Oscar. And the story's sad undertones were the perfect balance with the movie's wackiness.And there's something particularly fascinating in the way Burton presents it. In fact we never laugh at Ed Wood and his crew, but at the situations. Wood's troop is so touching and funny that we'd love to share their mood. The family is getting bigger from Bela Lugosi and Bill Murray as the caustic Bunny Breckinridge, to the iconic wrestler Tor Johnson, the delicious Vampira, and the distinguished hoax Crimswell whose predictions are as priceless as worthless, not to mention the chiropractor who'll replace Bela Lugosi after his death, notably in Plan 9 from Outer Space  Woody's pride and joy, literally, The Godfather of bad movies. We have a charming gallery of colorful characters so 'cartoonesque' it's like reality plagiarized fiction. Burton didn't need to make films about films, Wood's life is strange enough, marked with nonsensical signs of weirdness from the beginning. God, he wears wigs, angora sweaters and panties, and deals with it in the most serious manner. Is he a homo? No, he just likes to wear that, no big deal.And again, this is the touching aspect of the film it shows a gentle face of Ed Wood, a director whose famous career is mostly preceded by the prefix 'in'. But that's because the point is to insist on his nerve, his insistence and his passion. His personal idol was Orson Welles, who inspired him to be an actor, director and writer. He doesn't have the talent, but he's got the guts, and despite the adversity, he still made films with the same passion and sincerity. As Welles told him in a great scene Why spend your life making someone else's dreams? Wood fulfilled his dreams, his movies are cult, and his genius talent at making bad movies is a reference, when more talented directors sunk into oblivion. He loved the scenes as soon as they were shot, no retakes, when one scene could take a day, Ed Wood was making 20 or 30, due to the rush. This is less an alibi for Wood than a confirmation that he was born to make films. A very interesting scene is when the producer, watching the (in)famous Glen or Glenda takes it at a joke and then genuinely laughs at the ridiculousness of the film. So bad it's good ...And this is what Glen or Glenda, Plan 9 From Outer Space or any of Ed Wood's films are about, providing enjoyment, even unintentional. And if Wood managed to do that for many movie lovers after his death, that's enough. And it takes a certain genius to be an artist whose name is most remembered than his creations.

In fact we never laugh at Ed Wood and his crew, but at the situations. Wood's troop is so touching and funny that we'd love to share their mood. The family is getting bigger from Bela Lugosi and Bill Murray as the caustic Bunny Breckinridge, to the iconic wrestler Tor Johnson, the delicious Vampira, and the distinguished hoax Crimswell whose predictions are as priceless as worthless, not to mention the chiropractor who'll replace Bela Lugosi after his death, notably in Plan 9 from Outer Space  Woody's pride and joy, literally, The Godfather of bad movies. We have a charming gallery of colorful characters so 'cartoonesque' it's like reality plagiarized fiction. Burton didn't need to make films about films, Wood's life is strange enough, marked with nonsensical signs of weirdness from the beginning. God, he wears wigs, angora sweaters and panties, and deals with it in the most serious manner. Is he a homo? No, he just likes to wear that, no big deal.And again, this is the touching aspect of the film it shows a gentle face of Ed Wood, a director whose famous career is mostly preceded by the prefix 'in'. But that's because the point is to insist on his nerve, his insistence and his passion. His personal idol was Orson Welles, who inspired him to be an actor, director and writer. He doesn't have the talent, but he's got the guts, and despite the adversity, he still made films with the same passion and sincerity. As Welles told him in a great scene Why spend your life making someone else's dreams? Wood fulfilled his dreams, his movies are cult, and his genius talent at making bad movies is a reference, when more talented directors sunk into oblivion. He loved the scenes as soon as they were shot, no retakes, when one scene could take a day, Ed Wood was making 20 or 30, due to the rush. This is less an alibi for Wood than a confirmation that he was born to make films. A very interesting scene is when the producer, watching the (in)famous Glen or Glenda takes it at a joke and then genuinely laughs at the ridiculousness of the film. So bad it's good ...And this is what Glen or Glenda, Plan 9 From Outer Space or any of Ed Wood's films are about, providing enjoyment, even unintentional. And if Wood managed to do that for many movie lovers after his death, that's enough. And it takes a certain genius to be an artist whose name is most remembered than his creations. And if he's remembered as the best from the worst, I guess it's probably more prestigious than being the worst of the best.

The first scene with the girls running screaming soaked in blood set a strange tone for the movie. I thought of it throughout and didn't know whether it was an embellishment on one of their fantasies or that something horrible was going to happen to them. Obviously I didn't know that the film was based on a true story despite the mention of the excerpts from Paulines diary at the beginning.The portrayal of the two girls and their relationship both with each other and with their parents and others in the lives was sympathetic of what many teenage girls go through, however not quite to the extent of these two. It made me feel a strong connection with the girls and their loving friendship with one another. I liked the way the homosexual theme was played down during the film, not using it so much as an excuse for the actions, instead playing more on their self obsession and hysterical nearsightedness. They are immature and seemingly unaware of much of the reality around them, it is unfortunate for them to have lived in a time of archaic mental health care when issues such as theirs were frowned upon and misunderstood.The cinematography throughout was beautiful, i found the expressions of Paulines face to have the heaviest effect on me. Also the use of the fantastical claymation scenes was done to great effect, however, I found that the girls were each called by three different names at times to be confusing. The names and definition of the clay figures was also confusing at times due to their looking so similar. However, it was a great connection to show what was going on in the minds of the girls. Particularly the scenes with the pink gem they used in the end to distract Honora before the fatal attack.All in all this film was a clear insight into the misunderstood mind of a teenager.

I have seen bits and pieces of the others, but watching them I just feel the same thing that I did when I watched this one. In a word 'bored'. The only thing that kept me entertained was the scenery and seeing the many British A and B list stars. The most enjoyment I got out of the film is saying its the villain from Die Hard! he must be a bad guy!, That's the dude who got messed up by Gene Hackman in Unforgiven!, he was in a couple of Bond films!, and you get the idea. The film features Harry Potter going to wizard school for the first time. His aunt and uncle keep him living in a closet so going to wizard school or heck math camp would be a nice change of pace for the kid. Well when he goes to school he makes friends quickly with this lass and red headed boy and these three would grow up into some very poorly photogenic to old for the roles adults. Seriously, they looked like they were stoned on the DVD cover of Deathly Hallows and all three just do not look like the type of people you put in movies. Well Harry quickly becomes adept at the sport of wizardry Quiditch which involves flying around on a broom and scoring points. I know, when I hear flying brooms I think witches and witchcraft, but this is wizard school cause that is what the author says! There is also a bit of a mystery to be solved and an ending that will become very familiar with those who enjoy this series. I did not care for this one and I never continued following Harry's adventures, I am not going to fault those who do, this set of films just was not for me and man they are going on to long. Heck, by the time they are all finished they will probably remake them all again two years later.

There are loads of snappy one-liners too, the stars not too proud to send themselves up - Crosby makes a crack about Hope's nose while Hope spoofs Crosby's crooning. Dorothy Lamour looks suitably exotic and has no problem yet again convincing the viewer of her ability to bewitch her usual three men, Hope Crosby and Anthony Quinn, all as usual. While Bob, unsurprisingly loses Dorothy once again to Bing he surprisingly this time gets a girl of his own by the finish.The songs are fine too (Ho-Hum, Constantly, Moonlight Becomes You and the jokey title song) and are much better woven into the flow of the film than on previous journeys.All in all, one of the funniest comedies from Hollywood's Golden Age, it quite rightly cemented the reputation of the Road franchise and kept the threesome on their travels for a road or two yet.
