I know the dog survives because under the end credits we see the animal burrow out from under the snow, shake itself off, then perform various doggy gavottes on a field of ice.Wow, Camille and Petra make a striking couple. Petra is beautiful and sexy in a conventional way, like a model. Her performance isn't bad either. It's competent enough and there is one moment when her employer asks her how she feels about leaving Camille and her face seems washed over with sorrow before she lowers it onto the guy's shoulder.Camille could be a model too, but not an ordinary one. She looks like a cross between Anouk Aimee and Martin Short. (Maybe a founder effect in the gene pool.) Her features are sharp and angular, where Petra's are soft and pliable looking, but she is very feminine.I can't comment on their figures. Not enough, in my opinion, is shown of them. There is hardly any nudity. And the sex scenes are all tender and loving and consist of aesthetically correct caresses of fingers across a vast expanse of unidentifiable but still succulent-looking flesh. Nobody moans or talks dirty. Well -- no movie is perfect. I can't understand why this movie received a more restricted rating than a simple R. It's really not much more than a rather sweet soapy love story.I should mention Henry Czerny as the confused and angry boyfriend of Camille. He has been uniformly good in every movie I've seen him in. He has a distinctive actorish face that could go either way -- into reason and compassion or into the villainy that has been his usual lot.The movie deserves plaudits for avoiding two traps, however obvious those traps are. It does not bash men and it does not bash religion. Neither potential target does anything to help the situation, not nearly as much as Pure Love does, but both do their limited best.Plot holes and dialog solecisms (This morning was an anomaly. Cf Last night was a mistake.) aside, the story is nicely presented. The director, Patricia Rozema, takes it at a deliberate pace and decorates the screen with occasional arty images or unexpected phantasmagoria. (Arty in a good sense.) When the circus trucks leave town at the end her camera lingers on a poster of a huge eye which may not carry much symbolic weight but effectively grabs the viewer's attention.I wound up hoping that Camille could be revived without loss of limbs and that she and Petra would somehow make it together, although, as Petra had earlier observed, Everything turns ordinary after a while.

Welles meets Mrs. Christian who says that she has discovered a reel of film in her late husbands safe that appears to be snuff & seemingly show's a young girl being brutally abused & murdered, she asks Welles if he will investigate the film & try to put her mind at rest that it's fake. Welles accepts, with a little detective work he learns that the girls name is Mary Ann Mathews (Jenny Powell) & that she was reported missing several years ago. After speaking with her mum Janet (Amy Morton) the case takes him to California where he meets porn shop clerk Max California (Joaquin Phoenix) whom he enlists to help guide him through the underground world of S\/M & hard porn to find the men responsible for the supposed snuff film... This American German co-production was co-produced & directed by Joel Schumacher & is a reasonably entertaining thriller with a sleazy undertone. The script by Andrew Kevin Walker (who apparently left the film after a disagreement with Schumacher who along with Nicholas Kazan reworked the script) moves along at a decent enough pace although I was starting to get a little bored by the end & I think at 2 hours it's too long & drawn out. The story is simple with basic mystery elements that don't particularly grip or engage, the whole thing is somewhat predictable & it paints the entire S\/M & porn community as gun carrying sadistic freaks which clearly they are not. Virtually all the character's in 8MM that Welles runs into are scum who peddle sick porn for their own gain & care little for anyone else, nothing like having a balanced point of view... I also found the climax where Welles phoned Mary's mum for justification & permission to take revenge on the people reasonable for her daughter's death really silly & just didn't work for me. Having said that it still provides decent entertainment & is certainly watchable if you want something a little darker than usual. The actual porn & violence content is rather low, there is some nudity & gore but things are generally kept to a minimum, there is however plenty of very strong language. With a supposed budget of about $40,000,000 8MM doesn't do anything to justify that sort of money, the film looks slick, it has a gritty washed-out look & is well made for sure but nothing really stands out. The acting is OK especially the likable Phoenix although Cage isn't that good & is undistinguished, bland & forgettable as Welles as he makes the transition from a normal everyday life to one filled with porn & darkness. I quite liked 8MM, it's a pretty good thriller but ultimately the misinformed moral stance on S\/M & porn in general hurts it & the story itself could have been a little stronger as it contains one of the most unsurprising twists I've ever seen & little justification is given for anything that happens.

I am a male in my early thirties and the film has touched me in such a way that I have never been touched by an old movie before. Even though I have not lived in that time era the film portrays. However, I have seen many old films that are from the older version, and I have yet to see a film that projects human feeling as much as this film has done it for me. Genuine love between two youngsters who have yet to experience the world's bad side, a side that affects plenty of flowers from blossoming; went astray. Discrimination on the basis of wealth is the main cause for Deanie's bad end, which is no different than other forms of discrimination that Bud's family put on the not-so well to do young lady, Deannie. It is unfortunate that Bud ended up having a normal traditional life that rich and well to do young ladies longed for at the time. The character played as Deanie longed for basic love from Bud to which he was unable to deliver due to his family's constant intervention on his son's personal life; it is his father that denied him pleasure of having 'happiness' with his high school sweetheart. Happiness, which he would have preferred over controlling his family's business could bring him. Unfortunately, not all people have the same lens of view of seeing life from different angle. In the opinion of the writer of this comment, wealth is not only gained from money, wealth is gained from all the riches of satisfying life, life that is fulfilled with little achievements. In this particular film, the young man's family translated wealth as a source of pride and happiness. Despite, in the eye of a capitalist's vision of happiness, his father did what he thought was best for his son. After all, who wouldn't wish the best for his or her child? It was also sad to see Deannies' father unable to do anything to counter the rejection of his daughter, except resent his inablity to supply his family with the riches other men do.The writer\/director played Deanie's character in a very exposed emotion laid for the audience to smash it open and be ashamed of it to its end. I was close to tears at times, especially at the end when she discovered that her Bud was married with a toddler and pregnant wife. It made his new wife cry with envy, as to who he gave up to be with her. It is visible to see from Deanie's eyes the disappointments, it just reminds me of my other favorite movie seen, Carlito's Way, the character played by Al Pacino, when he was attempting to convince his love interest played as Gail. In that seen, he meets her at a place of her work and very disturbed by what she does for living, strip joint dancer. He tries to hide his feeling of disappointment, but she learns his judgment when her fans came to express their joy for having to see her dance. Right at that moment, when she mentioned something he has been dodging to avoid, his eyes tell it all. In my view the seen captured is by far the best of all movies I have seen capturing the emotional disappointment visually being captured. Splendor In The Grass, has captured that sort of emotion from a female perspective, the writer\/director added dignity to the expression of disappointment. That was heartbreaking to have to witness such devastating reality Deanie has to swallow. Her eyes tell it all, as they were hungry to see her own life find that very end, an end she would have been very pleased to see.It teaches the audience that time is a river, unlike a lake (pond) it travels, Bud did what was normal for him to do, find another girl and fall in love with. It also shows that no two loves are equal, the love Deanie and Bud had for each other was not at equilibrium. If it was, he would have married her after discovering of his father's death. At the end when she came out of her madness to remember him as he was, while he has forgotten all about her and moved on.

It was also sad to see Deannies' father unable to do anything to counter the rejection of his daughter, except resent his inablity to supply his family with the riches other men do.The writer\/director played Deanie's character in a very exposed emotion laid for the audience to smash it open and be ashamed of it to its end. I was close to tears at times, especially at the end when she discovered that her Bud was married with a toddler and pregnant wife. It made his new wife cry with envy, as to who he gave up to be with her. It is visible to see from Deanie's eyes the disappointments, it just reminds me of my other favorite movie seen, Carlito's Way, the character played by Al Pacino, when he was attempting to convince his love interest played as Gail. In that seen, he meets her at a place of her work and very disturbed by what she does for living, strip joint dancer. He tries to hide his feeling of disappointment, but she learns his judgment when her fans came to express their joy for having to see her dance. Right at that moment, when she mentioned something he has been dodging to avoid, his eyes tell it all. In my view the seen captured is by far the best of all movies I have seen capturing the emotional disappointment visually being captured. Splendor In The Grass, has captured that sort of emotion from a female perspective, the writer\/director added dignity to the expression of disappointment. That was heartbreaking to have to witness such devastating reality Deanie has to swallow. Her eyes tell it all, as they were hungry to see her own life find that very end, an end she would have been very pleased to see.It teaches the audience that time is a river, unlike a lake (pond) it travels, Bud did what was normal for him to do, find another girl and fall in love with. It also shows that no two loves are equal, the love Deanie and Bud had for each other was not at equilibrium. If it was, he would have married her after discovering of his father's death. At the end when she came out of her madness to remember him as he was, while he has forgotten all about her and moved on. I find the film very soothing to the soul, and took me back to reminisce my own past life.

Now, T2 Judgement Day proves to be one of the few sequels ever made which actually surpass the original in quality, bringing back all the successful elements which defined the first film, and re- creating them to a greater extent here. Director James Cameron proves to be one of the wisest directors around, as he takes what could have been a terrible gratuitous action movie, and turns it into one of the defining movies of the genre. The plot is paper thin a killer robot from the future (Schwarzenegger) is sent back in time to protect John Connor (Edward Furlong) who will grow up to be the leader of the resistance against the robot armies in the future wars against the robots. However, a different, more advanced model of Terminator (Robert Patrick) is also sent back with the intention of killing John Connor. Meanwhile, John's mother Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) escapes from the insane asylum she has been kept in, and gets tangled up in the mayhem.It's probably one of the simplest plots in film history, in fact, I summed it up to a friend of mine as Arnie is the good robot. The other one is bad. The bad robot wants to kill the kid, Arnie wants to protect him. But the execution of this simple story has such an infectious sense of fun that the viewer can't help but love every moment of it. It's one of the few action movies one doesn't have to regard as a guilty pleasure, because it's regarded as such a classic. And after viewing it, it's no wonder why T2 has been widely proclaimed The greatest action movie of all time!Admirably, Cameron seems to know not to take himself too seriously, as shown with the opening sequence, as a nude Arnold takes out a whole bar full of bikers with the announcement I need your clothes, your boots and your motorcycle. After claiming said clothes, he promptly snatches a pair of sunglasses and a shotgun from the astonished bartender, and is on his way, all of this accompanied by the song Bad to the Bone. It really helps the film that it never takes itself too seriously, as it adds to the enjoyment factor, without any heavy life lessons being thrust at the audience. Cameron also incorporates numerous iconic shots, such as the Terminator stepping on a fallen rose, placing on its sunglasses for the first time, and the robot crushing the human skull at the beginning. The Special Effects would be considered mind-blowing if used for a current day movie, but considering the movie was made back in 1991, they should be considered nothing less than astonishing. All the effects around the T-1000's morphing properties are incredibly well done and 'real' looking - a remarkable technical achievement, which deservedly bagged the 'Best Visual Effects' Oscar. T2 also won technical Oscars for Sound Editing, Makeup and Best Sound. It's not every action movie that manages to win four Oscars - another reason the movie deserves its iconic status. But not all aspects of T2 are classic standard. As a whole, the acting leaves much to be desired - especially in the cases of Linda Hamilton and newcomer Edward Furlong. Neither give a particularly bad performance, but they each have so many annoying mannerisms, (Furlong's voice cracking adolescent screech and frustratingly blatant 80's haircut being the worst) that in many cases the viewer finds themselves wishing that the T-1000 would simply hurry up and kill them both. However, it's hard to go wrong with Arnold reprising his career defining role, and it becomes very clear that there was no better man alive to play a robot. (pause for comedic effect to set in. No? Alright then...) Schwarzenegger may probably have the least range out of any actor in Hollywood, but this was the role he was born to play, and every second he is offscreen, we desperately wish he was on screen again. Robert Patrick also plays a great villain as the shape-shifting T-1000. Though most of his part is dominated by special effects, Patrick still comes off as very menacing and dangerous - the perfect villain to counterbalance the equally stoic Arnie.So it's really no wonder T2 is considered the definitive action movie the action sequences are superb, the special effects are remarkable, even for today, and there's this infectious sense of fun that allows the audience to overlook some of the movies shortcomings, most notably in the acting department. But all in all, T2 is a highly enjoyable and very strongly made film. Take it for what it is, and you should be suitably entertained. Which is all the movie really set out to do, so it can be considered nothing less than a rousing success. To all doubters of the movie's quality.

While the first two in the film are good, the third and last story in the collection, Lover's Vow, is nothing less than superb. Lover's Vow would have, quite appropriately, been made into a full-length film. It would have been wonderful to have seen this as one installment in a series of Tales from the Darkside films.Lover's Vow is a love story borne out of the womb of darkness itself. Carola (Rae Dawn Chong) is beautiful and seductive, and her overwhelming maternal energy and beauty nicely compliments the persona exuded by Preston (James Remar), with his obvious yearning for security and stability.The build-up to the quite tragic ending is lovely. Penniless New York artist Preston is confronted with a living horror. He witnesses the death of a friend at the hands of a gargoyle. The gargoyle spares Preston's life in exchange for keeping his knowledge of its existence a secret. He can tell no one what he saw and heard. On the way home, he meets beautiful Carola, and he beckons her to come with him, fearing that the creature may be lingering about.But, unknown to Preston, he has just taken the monster with him. This fact is in no way made apparent to the viewer; Preston exudes his compassion and blankets a seemingly innocent woman. Immediately attracted to one other, they consummate their blossoming passion in a truly wonderful love scene. A bluish light engulfing them, coupled with lovely music, they kiss and caress. Knowing how tragically the story ends, the scene becomes all the more beautiful.Toward the end, Carola and Preston are engaged in discussion about their future. Preston suggests a myriad of possibilities; he, ultimately, just wants the one woman that he loves to be happy. There is nothing you can give me that I don't already have... she says. His answer Yes, there is. He then divulges his secret to her, while handing her a handmade statue of the gargoyle he'd seen. Carola slowly grasps it and begins to pace away. Clutching the statue and weeping, she turns and says, in anger and pain, You promised you'd never tell!Carola's humanity is lost; the broken vow becomes the key to death's door, for both him and their love. In a macabre scene, Carola begins to transmogrify into a gargoyle; their children do like wise.Preston beckons her to change back, and, mid-stride between humanity and nonhuman monstrosity, Carola states I can't. Hearing the heart-wrenching sounds of his children in pain from the change, he asks her to halt this horrifying procession. The gargoyle states It's too late, you betrayed your vow. The gargoyle embraces Preston, and when she does so, he says Carola, I loved you, his voice seeming to hiss the word love. Uttering that she had loved him, too, she kills him. Resting his body gently on the floor, she weeps in pain.With her children in tow, Carola flies into the night. She becomes a frozen statue atop an old building, clutching her children, to wait for the moment when the cycle of love and death must reiterate itself.I cannot stress enough what a wonderful job the filmmakers did with this particular story. If you are a horror fan and would like to see some fine horror stories not laden with cheap, low-budget CGI (I'd rather see low-budget puppetry), then at least rent it if only to watch Lover's Vow. Horror and romance are entwined in a very delicate story about simple humanity, the yearning for love, and love's sometimes all-consuming pain.

What all these heroes (and in the case of X-Men hero group) have in common is that they were all conceived in the magical world of Marvel. Blade was originally a normal person (in a blue outfit) who chased vampires because of a personal grudge and eventually facing of with Dracula himself and he was for lack of a better word boring. So boring in fact that the character was shelved and in fact never used in the Marvel universe. At least until he was reinvented.David Goyer did a stroke of genius when he took the character of Blade and turned him into a leather clad dark knight. He can't take all the credit though and much of this must go to Stephen Norrington as well who with his distinct visual style brings out the best of the character. The Blade character (Wesley Snipes) is pretty amazing in this film and mixes martial arts with Batman like darkness. Snipes is pretty good as the title character and is successful in bringing out the duality and inner demons of the character. He is, however, a pretty rigid actor both in voice and in posture and is only interesting enough for one film (which is clearly seen from the inferior sequels). Kris Kristofferson is good as well and really brings the tormented character of Whistler to life with energy and sense of timing. N'Bushe Wright, however, is fairly weak as a leading lady making her character relatively flat and lifeless. Donal Logue is pretty funny and manages to do a lot with a minor character. German, Udo Kier, should also be mentioned as he brings a lot of finesse and style to the vampire race, probably born of his experiences from playing Dracula. Stephen Dorf provides the best acting in the film and his chilling performance as Deacon Frost stands as one of the best screen villains I have perhaps ever seen.The story is good and, I feel, renews the vampire genre (something that hasn't been done since Robert Rodrigues' From Dusk Till Dawn) by adding a lot of contemporary elements and maintaining the comic book feel. By saying that the film has a comic book feel does not mean that the film is unrealistic. Far from it. A lot of effort has been put in trying to make the film seem as real as possible.

In stead of adding a lot of blood when a vampire dies Norrington chose to let the vampires spontaneously com-bust which looks great.

While the film medium as a whole has never been as good as books when documenting someone's life or career, Stone's portrayal of Morrison unforgivably verges on fiction in its artistic license.

Not exactly the best summation for a man whose cultural contributions to American music can still be felt 35 years after his death. Nice going, Oliver.On the positive side the movie looks incredibly good, (most likely due to cinematographer Robert Richardson rather than Stone himself), and the viewer does come away with a feel for Morrison's charisma, stage presence, and mystical inclinations. Val Kilmer had deep shoes to fill and very convincingly does so - perhaps the only person on planet earth capable of bringing such a complicated character as Morrison to the screen. The rest of the cast also is well-placed, even though the characters on the screen were considerably different than who they were portraying. (Thanks again, Oliver.)All in all, the movie is worth watching. If you're an intrigued first-timer being introduced to the music and legacy of The Doors from this movie, take it with a grain of salt and do yourself a favor - go out and get the biographies of former band members Ray Manzarek and John Densmore, then watch the live concert material available.

Nice going, Oliver.On the positive side the movie looks incredibly good, (most likely due to cinematographer Robert Richardson rather than Stone himself), and the viewer does come away with a feel for Morrison's charisma, stage presence, and mystical inclinations. Val Kilmer had deep shoes to fill and very convincingly does so - perhaps the only person on planet earth capable of bringing such a complicated character as Morrison to the screen. The rest of the cast also is well-placed, even though the characters on the screen were considerably different than who they were portraying. (Thanks again, Oliver.)All in all, the movie is worth watching. If you're an intrigued first-timer being introduced to the music and legacy of The Doors from this movie, take it with a grain of salt and do yourself a favor - go out and get the biographies of former band members Ray Manzarek and John Densmore, then watch the live concert material available.

Unfortunately he plays so fast and loose with the truth that the end result is more a work of fiction rather than of history. Such is the case with The Doors, a movie that any real Doors fan knows is only a caricature of the band's front-man, Jim Morrison.Stone took the most sensational moments in Morrison's life and focused on it entirely, the end result being that he captured only a mere sliver of Morrison's true life and personality. While the film medium as a whole has never been as good as books when documenting someone's life or career, Stone's portrayal of Morrison unforgivably verges on fiction in its artistic license. Absent is the sensitive, intelligent person who many - including himself - considered a true poet, missing is the person who acknowledged the ridiculousness of his celebrity and sought to destroy it one glorious night in Miami, and equally missing is the source of the person who WAS James Douglas Morrison.

The scenes flow smoothly, no choppy editing; the dialogue is brilliant and contains the right amount of humor; no shoddy special effects (my biggest problem with modern day movies) to ruin the feel of authenticity; no over-the-top action scenes; and finally, James Horner's score is absolutely breathtaking--the crowning jewel of one amazing movie.Matthew Broderick completely blew me away. The emotional intensity behind his eyes and facial expressions is incredible. The beach scene before the charge on Fort Wagner comes to mind--some brilliant acting right there. To be able to perform roles as polar opposite as Ferris Bueller and Robert Gould Shaw really demonstrates his range (and underratedness) as an actor. He brilliantly captured a young man striving to do the right thing in midst of war, to do his duty and fulfill his responsibility to his men, while having personal doubt and uncertainties at the same time. For me, as far as acting and character go, he was the highlight of the movie. The director could easily have made him a perfect, Hollywoodized action hero, but instead the character remains human--he has fears, he has uncertainties, and he doubts himself just as we all do. He's not a Bruce Willis or a John Wayne--it is very refreshing and realistic, and most of all, true to the character, true to the real Robert Gould Shaw revealed in his memoirs.Morgan Freeman is, as always, a joy to watch. He has long been one of my favorite actors, and he truly shines in this movie. His character is one of the most memorable, aside from Denzel Washington's, who also delivered an amazing performance. He earned that Oscar, no question. Never once did I think of these men 'acting', it is so natural.If you haven't seen this one, go rent it, or better yet, buy it. You won't be disappointed.
