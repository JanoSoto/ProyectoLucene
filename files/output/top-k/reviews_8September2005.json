Breaking into the magic school to steal they are captured by Marina but, when her master is killed, the thieves find themselves drawn into an attempt by the evil Profion to use the power of a lost sceptre to seize control from Empress Savina, who is trying to reform and make all men equal.It is hard to really judge the plot of this film because I'm sure it could have been a rollicking, engaging swords & sorcery affair and it is only the delivery here that has turned it into a massive, insulting pile of rubbish. The way that the characters have to explain every single action in BIG LETTERS for the audience was something that grated on me and took me from thinking of it as lazy writing to finding it offensive that the writers thought I was too stupid to follow the story myself. Instead of being a strong narrative the film is just a basic adventure for kids, with effects and noise to keep them distracted. As such it is still only so-so because even children might struggle to care about the unimpressive CGI backgrounds and action set pieces. It'll please the very undemanding genre fan under 12 years old but unlikely many others.The characters are another major failing &#150; who thought that writing obnoxious, annoying or smug characters across the leads would cause an audience to be engaged by them? With this to work with, is it any wonder that the cast are roundly poor? Whalin must have thought his luck was in when he landed this role, but he messes it up with a performance that shows he is out of his depth and unsure of himself. McLellan is bland and quite irritating for the majority of the film but her faults pale in comparison to a trio of performances that stick in the mind as the worst of the film. Irons hams it up with all the carelessness of a pro who knows an easy payday when he sees it &#150; he is hilariously terrible at times. Payne's blue lipstick seems to have affected his voice and every line is delivered as a sneer &#150; it is never menacing and quickly becomes tiresome. However the worst performance is form, surprise surprise, Wayans who made me understand what Spike Lee's Bamboozled was getting at. He is a shrieking, mugging ethnic cliché &#150; even worse than he usually does and even more annoying. The odd cameo from O'Brien or Baker do nothing to stop the rot and the cast add to the impression that this was cheaply made without much love.Overall a poor film that will probably only appeal to kids. The plot is badly delivered and the effects are not as impressive as director Solomon was clearly banking on them being. The cast are lost in the middle of it all and not a single on of them gives a performance that you could call good, all in all producing a pretty poor attempt at a blockbuster.

Seagal naturally gets mad and what's more important; He gets even.I love these no-nonsense action flicks that delivers what you most crave for; ACTION and plenty of it. Director Dwight H. Little (Halloween 4, Rapid Fire) handles the proceedings well and actually gives the film some stylistic flair as well. In most parts, the script is well written and it gives Seagal some great one-liners.Seagal, as always, is reliable and delivers the same performance as usual.

Keith David, a regular supporting actor, gives a good performance and overall the cast do a good job.Unfortunately Seagal's days of high class movies are gone and will probably never come back.

It's my all time favorite film by Walt Disney. I like the storyline and characters. It's a feel good adventure. One thing I always liked about this movie is the family was like a real family, no one perfectly got along. The boys had their own fights with each other. The rivalry between Fritz (James MacArthur) and Ernst (Tommy Kirk) who both want the girl, Roberta (Janet Munro)is funny and good. This is better than most Disney live action films. As a child this was my favorite film, and I still find it great today. Having been born way after the movie first came out, I'm still taken in by this timeless adventure. I think the whole cast did a great job and it's good to be able to sit down with a bowl of popcorn and enjoy this with family.

I really like this movie, why people call it bad I will never really understand. It's a comedy, and I laughed. A lot, and hard. Isn't that the point of comedies?? Jim Carrey takes insane character acting to new heights as Chip Douglas, the very lonely cable installer whose sole purpose in life seems to be lisping out lines from TV shows, movies and this-and-that. When he meets the dorky, recently dumped Steven M. Kovacs (played to nervous-wimp perfection by Matthew Broderick), he thinks that he has finally found a good friend. Pity Steven doesn't think so.What follows is a series of hilarious, kind of dark, and mean at places, but still hilarious, scenes where Chip and Steven do stuff that pals do (going to the Medieval Times restaurant and duelling to the death; playing porno password with Steven's family; playing basketball; and doing the karaoke (Carrey's version of Don't you want somebody to love is not to be missed!)).After numerous hilarious scenes Steven finally goes brutally honest on Chip and tells him that he's not his friend and doesn't want all the help with stuff, that Chip can offer. That was the biggest mistake he ever made...After this it becomes some kind of weird, hilarious psycho-horror-thriller, and this is probably what puts most people off (or perhaps Carrey's lisp). But I love every second of the movie, it's original, it's dark, it's actually funny, it's absurd, almost surreal, and of course it has Jim Carrey in it, in my opinion one of the greatest actors of our time.If you want a big laugh, don't be put of by all the negative reviews and the low ratings... Ben Stiller wanted to make a comedy and try something new, so he made it really dark, used the subject of stalking for originality, and the result is a laugh-out-loud-funny movie, full of gags, violence, stalking, romance, yes everything you can wish for.

Back when I saw it I was probably mid teens and It was one of those movies I taped off HBO or something and I must have watched it like 5+ times as it was my favorite horror \/ sci-fi movie for a while. So it's better than the review score lets on, but would I rent it today even if I could find it? Hmm&#133;. Tough question. Remember too that this came out in a era of Nightmare on Elm street, Friday the 13th, and very little else in the way of horror flicks, so given it's level of competition at the time, I thought it was good. There's no nudity that I can recall (so that's a minus) but man Kristy Swanson looks great. She's much younger here as it's one of her first films, little bit of baby fat on her but man o man what a rack she has.Spoilers ahead&#133; I think I liked it so much because it was a mix of things that I was into at the time. For one it's kind of a horror \/ Sci-Fi combo, which I love and still love to this day. Plus it had a sort of twisted romantic aspect as the Matthew (Paul &#150; the computer geek new on the block) tries to bring back his Girlfriend back to life by inserting his pet Robot's brain into Swanson's brain after she dies by way of her father. Kind of twisted and far fetched, but such are most Sci-Fi's so go with it&#133; At this point the movie changes a bit from being a drama to more of a horror. You kind of feel sorry for Swanson and the situation as a whole being that she's now like a newborn, with a new brain and doesn't understand anything.

The film has all the right ingredients for an enthralling thriller, but something has gone wrong with the delivery because it doesn't all bode together well enough for this to be considered any more than just above average. The film's main selling point is, of course, the fact that it stars Al Pacino. Pacino is an actor that will always make films worth watching, but it's worth noting that this is one of his 'autopilot' roles that really only requires him to power through every scene, rather than actually act. It's a shame that Pacino is on autopilot, because it's not every day that you get to see him paired with John Goodman and the two do work well together. If Pacino had managed to really get his teeth into the role like he has in so many other films, this pairing could have been something special; but instead, it manages to merely be amusing.The plot follows Pacino's police detective who discovers that a couple of murders in the neighbourhood are linked by a lonely hearts column and, after teaming up with John Goodman's detective from the other side of town, the pair put an advert in the same column on the hope of trapping the killer. What Pacino doesn't count on is falling in love with the suspect. The plot is never a problem for this film; the problem is the plotting. The first hour is really well done - it's engaging, thrilling and even quite funny, but towards the middle, the plot just dips and it doesn't manage to recapture it's previous form until the climax, and by then it's too late to save itself. Anyone whose seen Mike Myers' comedy So, I Married an Axe Murderer will recognise the plot instantly, but unfortunately; this is one of those occasions where the stolen ideas have been put to better use than the original ones. Don't get me wrong, though, this is still a good film and well worth seeing for fans of crime dramas. It's just massive shame that the writers couldn't write a film that has a plot as consistent as the good ideas that were put into it.

Do you believe that love between two soul mates could be so strong as to cross any divide? If these things sound like a story well worth hearing then you are probably target audience for this film and may well enjoy it. Certainly its blend of the supernatural and eternal love will be best enjoyed by those who rate Ghost as one of their favourite movies ever. For the majority, the sentimentality may be a bit too much to swallow though but it still does enough as a mystery to keep things moving forward. When the ending does come though, it does have enough emotional syrup to choke a camel and it takes its time to get to the conclusion that we all knew was coming. The mix of jump scares and romance doesn't work that well but, like I say, it pushes the right buttons to suit the target audience, even if it pushes the emotion one a bit too hard.Costner is roundly depressed from start to finish and can't do much more with his character than mope around the place looking sad before occasionally looking frenzied and determined.

It seemed to me that it started out as silent movie and then was changed to a talkie.If you are a Hitch fan you might want to see this otherwise skip it and watch The 39 Steps, Young and Innocent or The Lady Vanished instead.

When cleaning the moat he spots a glowing necklace in the water and tries to get it only to fall in headfirst. When he comes out of the water he finds himself in a wood with Medieval people around him. Assuming he is near Castle World, he heads for the castle to get a job he finds himself mistaken for a messenger but plays along to try and impressive his prospective employers. However a beheading convinces him that something is wrong and, accepting the idea of time travel easily, he soon finds himself involved in a plot to remove the king from power and return the queen to her rightful position.In case you didn't notice, Martin Lawrence is black. And, y'see, they didn't have black people in the olden days &#150; so imagine the hilarity that would ensue if Lawrence were to travel back in time to the 14th Century and help the King get his groove on, get freaking with the maidens and lead a rebellion? In case you don't want to imagine, then let me assure you that very little hilarity ensues in this very uninspiring film that even fans of Martin Lawrence will find hard to enjoy. From the very first scene of Lawrence mugging in a bathroom mirror you know what you're in for &#150; but I blame myself for not bailing out at that point. From here on it we have lots of black fish out of water jokes, none of which are that funny and just sees the race card being played in every other line. It is rarely funny and it gets tiresome very quickly. The attempts to bring in a plot of sorts in the second half are far too little, far too late.I actually enjoy Martin Lawrence because, as much as I hate myself for it, I do find him funny sometimes &#150; but this was not one of those times. He is lumbered with poor material and he can do nothing to improve it &#150; pulling faces and such do nothing to make it better. God knows what Tom Wilkinson was doing here (apart from getting a payday); he adds a bit of class but not enough. Thomason is the only black maid for a million miles and takes it all too seriously but is still pretty &#150; which is what she is really there for. The rest of the cast are OK all things considered but none have anything to do other than be straightmen for Lawrence's mugging and falling over &#150; a pretty thankless task.Overall this is just what it looks like &#150; a black fish out of water comedy where all the jokes are about race and as obvious as you like.

In her club she gets the attention of men from all walks of life &#150; a gentle little obsessive up to a Republican congressman in the club in disguise. When the obsessive offers Erin a chance to get her daughter back by blackmailing a powerful person, he ends up dead. Meanwhile the congressman becomes obsessed with his angel and wants to be with her while his associates worry that she is yet another threat that could expose his hypocrisy and bring him (and them) tumbling down.I understand from people that know that Hiassen's book is very much a hilarious satire on American Conservatism and what he views to be the hypocritical way they approach life. I accept this may be the case, because you can see how the various characters, stories and themes within this film could be used to create such a work, but if it was pulled of in the book then I applaud it because it certainly didn't work in the film. This is a real problem, because if it had been clever and sharp then I could have probably forgiven it the glaring problems that run all the way through it. Sadly, without this intelligence, the narrative is all that is left and it is mostly dire. From the very start we are expected to swallow a lot of unlikely events and this continues the whole film through &#150; I couldn't get past this and as a result the rest of the film is just plain weak. The story itself didn't engage me once and is incredibly uneven and half-cooked. I'm sure the novel used the strip club as a background rather than the focus and I suspect the film tried to do the same, but it is hard to buy that whenever everything grinds (pardon the pun) to a halt for Moore to have a dance every now and again.The cast can't do anything to help because most of them seem to be in different films. Moore herself appears to be in at least three different movies and none of them are any good. Her body is good but her dancing isn't; her character has potential to be complex but her performance is as flat as a pancake. Reynolds is in the hilarious satire that I'm told the book is and, in his scenes he is actually pretty good and if the whole film had been this movie then he would have been perfect. However, as it is, his performance doesn't fit with the majority so he does end up looking very silly and out of place. Playing it down the middle without being as cr*p as Moore, support is actually OK from Rhames, Assante, Patrick, Guilfoyle and a few others but it is a matter of them making the best of a bad situation rather than doing well.Overall this is a poor film that missing the potential it had by failing to bring off the sharp satire that aspects of it suggest it should have been. The narrative is roundly poor and uninteresting, failing to do anything (the politics, the mother\/daughter stuff, the strip stuff) well at all. Mostly the film uses nudity as a background and doesn't make a fuss of it, but as soon as Moore gets them out the film comes to a complete stop, showing that this was perhaps the main focus of those involved &#150; certainly Moore's performance did nothing to convince me otherwise. Not bad enough to be worth seeing for laughs, this is really just a mishmash of failed attempts and missed targets that ends up doing nothing of value at all.

But we watch it constantly. Even if my son watches it back to back, he's still captivated by it. It's a good movie...not bad for Sesame Street. The songs are good, except the one by Vanessa Williams - it's a bit bland, but of course, it would get stuck in our heads all day long. Mandy Patinkin is GREAT in this movie, just awesome. Perfect guy for the part. Good singing voice too.It's a cute movie. It does have lots of funny parts that only a kid will find funny and a parent will roll their eyes when the kid is not looking, but on the whole, it's amusing. The interruptions from Ernie and Bert are actually kind of cute, but any more of them would have been annoying.We like it. Good, clean, wholesome entertainment.
