I get the impression that in this instance Wood came closest to producing on screen what he conceived beforehand. That's not to say that it's his most enjoyable work because in the mad and crazy world of Wood, incompetence has been elevated almost to an art form and, therefore, some of his more unintentionally funny films are actually favoured by me. That said Bride of the Monster should certainly still please fans of bad psychotronic cinema. And, along with Glen or Glenda and Plan 9 From Outer Space would make excellent complementary viewing alongside Tim Burton's masterful biopic Ed Wood.The story is suitably ridiculous and not really worth going into. And it's not 100% obvious what the title actually means. Loretta King's character is clearly supposed to be the bride but there are two completely separate monsters and neither of them particularly appears to be the groom. One of the monsters is played by a stock footage octopus that turns hilariously into an inanimate giant prop in a puddle when attacking various members of the cast. The second monster is played by the one and only Tor Johnson, as a character called Lobo who is the sidekick of Bela Lugosi's Dr. Eric Vornoff. Lugosi is a lot of fun in this and despite the film's cruddiness, it's not a terrible showcase for him. Ironically, his turn in this ultra-cheap notorious movie has become one of his most iconic. He gets to say his famous 'I have no home' speech that was made famous in Burton's movie, and the sight of him whipping Tor into action in his (cardboard?) laboratory is both funny and highly memorable. In general, the acting is not as bad as is typical for a Wood film; although Dolores Fuller is, as usual, gloriously rubbish in her small role as the secretary &#x96; her short conversation with Loretta King is truly a non-acting master-class.It goes without saying that Bride of the Monster is not a film for everyone.

I am no longer the slightest surprised over the title of scariest film ever. This is true psychological horror masterpiece. It doesn't go in for cheap scares, overuse of gore and violence, it is just plain scary. Kubrick is a master of symbolics, and in a horror film it is very effective. This films surreal imagery has been copied hundreds of times since this film was released. And you know what they say; imitation is the greatest flatter. I for one love Kubrick's films, and from the looks of it several other directors in the world do too. Also I think it's nice to see that Kubrick can handle the horror genre too, very well I must say.Now before I finish I must say there are some potential disappointments for you. Kubrick and author Stephen King, didn't exactly get very well along. And Kubrick has a tendency to make films his way, even though the story itself isn't his. So for you out there who has read the book, or simply admire Kings work, you might have the same mixed feelings about this film as he did. Sure I think King is proud of being the author of the scariest film of all time, and he certainly earned some on this film, but it wasn't exactly what he had in mind. many of the same elements are in it, but Kubrick has taken many liberties. I for one think it is a great film, and I admire both men's work, and I would recommend this film to Kubrick and King fans alike. I'm just saying, it might not be quite sure what you expected. And if you're a hard ass King fan, you might wan't to check out the 1997 mini TV series. King produces it, and made sure everything went his way.I'm don't think the acting is necessary to mention, it's simply great. Jack Nicholsen is as scary as he'll ever get, and Shelly Duvall really impressed me, despite the fact that Kubrick has some scuffles with her. I think, that in the end, she did great. And of course, let's not forget Danny Lloyd, his only film performance, is nonetheless great.So what is my verdict? 10\/10 Of course.

The film begins promisingly with Angie Dickinson as the film's only sympathetic character, but after Dickinson is sliced to ribbons in an elevator, the film becomes talky and devoid of genuine wit or suspense. And despite its reputation, the film isn't sexy or scary. The humor is crude and dumb, and for suspense is created by an overused score and actions prolonged beyond endurance. Uncommitted performances from Nancy Allen, Keith Gordon, Dennis Franz and a gross Michael Caine fail to create genuine concern or interest and the ludicrous, patched-together plot isn't really interesting. Besides Dickinson, who is warm and appealing, Mary Davenport from DePalma's Home Movies and Sisters has a funny reaction as the woman in the restaurant, and the madhouse sequence at the end is effective, but Dressed to Kill offers few rewards. Sisters(73), a reworking of both Rear Window and Psycho, is DePalm a's best horror film and Hitchock homage.

The film begins promisingly with Angie Dickinson as the film's only sympathetic character, but after Dickinson is sliced to ribbons in an elevator, the film becomes talky and devoid of genuine wit or suspense. And despite its reputation, the film isn't sexy or scary. The humor is crude and dumb, and for suspense is created by an overused score and actions prolonged beyond endurance. Uncommitted performances from Nancy Allen, Keith Gordon, Dennis Franz and a gross Michael Caine fail to create genuine concern or interest and the ludicrous, patched-together plot isn't really interesting.
