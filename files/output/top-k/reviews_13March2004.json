It's really the only teen movie made in the last 15 years or so that I keep in my collection.The plot is simple enough. We have a bunch of high school kids getting together for one last party after graduation. We see all types interacting with one another and getting pretty wasted in the process. Our main character is a sensitive writer type who has been lusting after the most popular girl in school for the past four years. She has recently been dumped by her jock boyfriend, so this Mr. Sensitive thinks this party is his chance to finally hook up with her! Along the way we see several side plots involving nerds, sluts, stoners, jocks, white guys trying to act black, and any other type of kid that the high schools of today produce. Overall, this film is very, very well done. I'm still surprised how much I like it.And every 15 minutes or so Jaime Pressly can be seen strutting her stuff. I swear that girl is amazing! It's too bad she doesn't have that many scenes. The last we see of her is when the cops bust that party. She's all curled up and passed out on a chair. Just waiting for that special guy (like me) to carry her out of that party and take her home! Oh well, we can dream, can't we? By the way, the guy who plays her boyfriend is the guy in the pickup truck whose buddies beat the crap out of Dirk Diggler in Boogie Nights!Anyway, I like this film. The sensitive writer guy is a lot like me. I also connect a little with Seth Green's character since I was accused of acting black in high school because I was the first kid in the suburbs to listen to rap music. There's a little of each of these characters in all of us, I suppose.Do yourself a favor and watch this film if you get the chance. It's nothing profound or deep, just a bunch of kids having a wild party and learning some things about themselves and each other along the way.Oh, and have I mentioned that Jaime Pressly is in the movie?I'll give it 8 of 10 stars.So sayeth the Hound.

He sees the potential in using their skills to fight crime rather than being part of it.  When Greer is murdered, the three are cut loose but decide to investigate the killing themselves.  As they begin to dig they find a much more complicated conspiracy that they could have imagined, involving criminals as well as dirty cops.I don't even think that this film managed to even get a cinema release in the UK, so bad was the box office for it in the US.  If it was released then I totally missed it - although I really don't think I would have bothered with it even if it had played on the biggest screens in the biggest cinemas. Summers recently have had more than their fair share of TV remakes and retro shows - Charlie's Angels and Starsky & Hutch to name two as examples. What made this one flop was that Mod Squad as a film lacks fun, spark, invention and wit.  The plot is clichéd - to the point that even the characters start to make jokes about how clichéd it all seems (`I feel one of us should be saying we are too old for this sh*t' one says at one point). However, the plot isn't the problem - look at Charlie's Angels, it has zero plot yet it made enough money to made a sequel!It is the lack of fun etc that exposes the plot to scrutiny that it can't stand up to.  I was surprised by just how uninspired the whole thing was it had a cool cast, cool music and the potential for tongue in cheek snappy action.  However everything it did really just came across as ordinary - certainly `fun' is not a word I would use to describe it, maybe `passable' would be more appropriate.  The music is cool and the direction is slick but sadly this doesn't make it come across as swish and stylish - more superficial.The cool cast offer promise but only deliver disappointment.  Danes is sexy and that is all she is used for, posing in panties and that's about it. Ribisi is a good actor and seems to enjoy himself here, but he isn't as much fun to watch as he thinks and he can't carry the can himself.  Epps is a good looking guy and I like his films, but I am not so blind to know a bad performance when I see it.  Seemingly at a loss as to what the film is meant to do, he mumbles his way through with an instantly forgettable performance. The support cast is quite good on paper but can't lift this film - Farina, Brolin and a few others all add recognisable faces but that's about it.Overall this is not as awful as people say I think some reviewers here have been influenced by the witch hunt launched by some professional critics - everyone needs something to hate and occasionally this turns a poor movie into `the worst movie ever!' (see also Gigli).  However, this film is weak no matter how kind you are.  It's plot is lame, it's script full of clunky dialogue and the product uninspiring and dull.  The cast, music and direction are all cool superficially but it still a weak film that feels like the makers just assumed that a film remake of a 70's tv show would just make money by itself - they were wrong.

As sci-fi goes, its one of the best, but it makes a mediocre Alien movie.  And to those who think they should let this series `die', the only reason most people feel that way is because the series has been going down-hill.  If they make an excellent Alien 5, it would completely justify continuing the series.First off, I want to express how frustrated I am at the scenes that were cut in the theatrical release of Alien Resurrection.  In the uncut version in the Alien quadrilogy, there is this scene where Ripley is getting her intelligence tested by naming the pictures that are shown to her that was cut.  In the uncut version, there is a shot where she is presented with a picture of a girl, which clearly reminds her of Newt from Aliens.  These few seconds were cut from the scene in the theatrical release which would have added greatly to the movie, as it shows that the movie does not forget its roots and gives the Ripley character more personality and emotion.Another cut shot which should have been included is during the scene where Call and Ripley are in the ships chapel and Call is hacking into the ships computer.  Ripley tells Call that she remembers a girl who was very important to her, but now she can't even remember her name.  This should have been included for the same reasons and the first cut shot.Winona Ryder and Sigourney Weaver do excellent performances in this movie (Pretty much all the acting is done well), but I think the key thing that this movie and Alien 3 were flawed in was that they showed the Alien too much, taking away all its terror.  Perhaps that is why the latest two movies are not as good as the first two.In short, the movie is good sci-fi, but needs more focus on the actual characters.  While they all did have good development (Except for General Parez, who seems to be the stereotypical, stupid-military guy.) they needed the personality detailing that the first Alien movie had.  That way the audience actually cares when they die.If they do make an Alien 5, I hope that more focus will be on Ripley and her emotional struggle at all the loss she's endured in her lifetime.

The film era began just as the American frontier was closing, and it's only natural that the cinema took its place. Without a frontier to explore, a certain part of the American identity vanished.

Of course, he's known for making such films as Blue Velvet and Mulholland Dr., but people tend to forget about The Straight Story and The Elephant Man, two of his most touching films. And it's hard to grasp how he made Elephant directly after he made Eraserhead, considering basically the only similarity is that they're both shot in black and white.The Elephant Man stars John Hurt as the title character, real name John Merrick. He has been physically deformed since birth, and spends his life in a freak show around the turn of the century. One day, Dr. Frederick Treves (Anthony Hopkins) takes him to his hospital for examination, and realizes that there's more to this person than just his extremely deformed body, from which he gets the name Elephant Man. Some people, however, aren't ready to believe that he's not just a sideshow anymore.It's hard to know where to begin when writing a review for a movie like this. I suppose I'll begin with Lynch's directing. I liked how we weren't able to see what Merrick looked like until a half hour into the film, even though he was an intergral part. The black and white photography, however, didn't really seem to work, because a movie like this could be more expressive, although perhaps the makeup used was oddly colored. Some of the symbolism he used was obvious and a little strong, especially at the beginning.I can't go on in this review without talking about the makeup used on Hurt. It took 12 hours every day to apply, but from the black and white photography, it was hard to tell whether the makeup was extremely good or extremely fake for most of the movie. Near the end, though, I was able to tell how extraordinary the makeup was, helping me feel with the main character more.However, for a lot of the movie (mainly the middle), the plot goes from the examination of Merrick to Merrick talking with regular people. Emotion went with the original plot there, but soon after, quite possibly the most emotionally harrowing scene in the history of movies comes. Hurt does an amazing job as Merrick, and Hopkins puts in a good job as the doctor. Those are the two biggest characters, but the movie revolves around them. Overall it's a very good movie, with some great moments, but some other things fall apart.My rating 7\/10Rated PG for thematic elements.

This may seem to be a little over the top, considering its opposition, but I feel that what this film lacks in special effects is more than made up for by the depth of its characters and the sheer claustrophobic suspense of the final hour. Das Boot is a very faithful adaptation of the original book (which is fantastic as well), and is best viewed in its original German, but with English subtitles (assuming you are not German!). As a proud resident of Great Britain, you can understand how easy it is to hate the members of the U-boat fleet for what they did to so many crews in our Merchant Navy. Despite this, it is easy to contemplate how terrible an experience life in a U-boat was. After having watched this masterpiece, I felt (and still do feel) that the sheer boredom and terror of U-boat life was far worse than that experienced by allied surface crews.  This is not meant to disrespect anyone, but is meant to provide an accurate comparison.Other War films about the Battle of the Atlantic (e.g. The Cruel Sea, In Which We Serve & Sink the Bismark') are based almost entirely from the Allied perspective, and almost all Germans are portrayed as cold-blooded murderers. Das Boot is unique among movies of its genre in that it is based entirely around the Germans, but also that it does not portray any side to be morally superior. Das Boot's main theme seems to be the futility of war itself. The acting throughout is superb, and the set is highly effective at communicating the claustrophobia, cold and stench of the inside of a submarine. The soundtrack is uniquely chilling and thrilling, and simply adds to the rich feeling and accuracy of the plot. There have been far too few films made about the U-boat crews during the Second World War, but since Das Boot, it seems as though no others are necessary.

Instead of being simply silly it's really funny, and at times, thanks to DeNiro's talent, we can even sense a real anguish behind the mask of no-nonsense machismo.  There are times when he weeps abjectly and we feel what effort is involved in playing his public role.

But one summer, a young boy drowned all alone in the lake and no one came to help him. The camp counselors who should have been watching him were off making out and engaging in fornication instead of doing their job. Thus, someone killed the camp counselors with a very large knife and Camp Crystal Lake was closed down. It became known as Camp Blood in local legend, a haunted and forsaken place where no one in their right mind would go. But in the late 1970s, a well meaning group of fresh, new camp counselors decided to reopen Camp Crystal Lake and restore it to its former glory. Despite dire warnings from a bicycle riding nutball, the young people set about fixing up the campsite and enjoying the beauty of another summer. However, a mysterious someone is hunting down and killing the young people one by one in horribly brutal ways. Finally, only the innocent Alice is left alive. Will she survive her confrontation with the vengeful Crystal Lake Killer?I absolutely love the Friday the 13th series and I'm not really sure why. They're all pretty dumb and predictable; horny teens\/20somethings go to Camp Crystal Lake or close enough as to make no difference, have sex, get murdered and the Last Virginal Good Girl saves the day. Sometimes they replace the girl with a guy, or they move the action from the lake to Somewhere Else, wow! It's like watching someone set up a row of clay pigeons for someone else to blow to smithereens. This movie followed hard upon the heels of Halloween, and ended up being the more popular series due mostly to the character of Jason Voorhees. I'm not sure why Jason is the preferred masked madman; Michael Meyers had the exact same M.O. as Jason, but seems to lack something in comparison. Myself, I think he lacks sympathy. Jason Voorhees, an ugly, deformed little kid, cruelly ridiculed by his fellow camp goers at Crystal Lake, was left to drown a slow, terrifying death in the lake all alone, whilst the camp counselors were off making out. We can feel for Jason; we've all been that ugly little kid left to sink or swim on our own at one time or another. So hell yeah, I'm going to root for the ugly little nerd who returns a huge, muscle-bound bruiser wielding a machete. Go Jason, go!We can further sympathize with Jason in all the sequels that follow due mostly to the fact that it is NOT Jason doing all the brutal murders in this first installment, but rather his mother, a deranged and probably guilt ridden woman (where the hell was SHE when her baby was drowning, huh?) with a warped maternal instinct. One doubts that Jason could have received much love and nurturing from her, yet he remains loyal to her even after death. Jason may be a mute, masked, machine-like hulk, but at some point, he was human and it wasn't his fault that he became what he did...unlike Michael Meyers who was evil from the beginning.Anyway, that's my theory as to why this film was so incredibly popular and continues to spawn sequels to this day. It's all due to Jason Voorhees, because otherwise, all there is to this film is a bunch of dim-bulb kids, running around half dressed (sometimes in the rain), looking for places to screw and alcohol to drink, and presenting such a one-dimensional view of selfish youth that you don't give a damn when the ax rams into their face, or the knife pushes up through their jugular. Who cares? They weren't contributing much anyway, and they aren't anywhere near as interesting, complex or sympathetic as the tortured, eternal child, Jason.

Of course you have. (Unless you're British!) And that's why the torture scene in Marathon Man is arguably the most famous of all mainstream torture scenes. Even the infamous ear segment in Reservoir Dogs fails to relate to people around the world the same way as this does. Not everyone has had his or her ear chopped off.Anyone who has gone to a dentist before can relate to the fear and excruciating pain that Babe (Dustin Hoffman) experiences when he is asked, Is it safe? and has no idea what his interrogator is talking about, then finds himself being given a root canal without any Novocain.The interrogator is Szell (Laurence Olivier), a dreaded German murderer who carried out awful deeds during World War II and offered Jews a free ticket out--for a hefty price.Szell's question (Is it safe?) exists because he needs to know whether or not it is safe to withdraw diamonds he stole from Jews during World War II from a safety deposit box. As the film opens, Szell's brother dies in a car crash, which sets up this entire aspect of the plot, since his brother had the key to the vault.Babe's brother, Doc (Roy Scheider, JAWS), comes to visit him in New York City, but turns up at his apartment with stab wounds. Babe soon finds out that Doc was part of a secret Division (CIA black-ops stuff) that was on Svell's trail. Believing that Doc may have spilled the beans to Babe, Svell kidnaps the college graduate and this is where the famous torture scene starts. Is it safe? Is it safe? Is...it...safe...?I don't know what you're talking about!Marathon Man is often considered a classic of the thriller genre, and it certainly is. It has its flaws, and sometimes it seems a bit average from a technical viewpoint, but it set the stage for many gritty, coarse thrillers that would follow in later years. It is still arguably one of the greatest of them all.The title comes from the fact that Hoffman's character, Babe, is a marathon jogger. He runs every single day, and so when he finally manages to escape from Szell's grasp, you can imagine what a hard time they have chasing after him. In retrospect, the title takes on two different (and ironic) indications.The well-known story about Olivier's advice to Hoffman on the set of the film has been referenced many times (even by Steve Martin in Saturday Night Live), so it almost seems pointless to divulge into it. Basically, in the words of Steve Martin, Hoffman came to the set one day looking absolutely wretched, and Sir Larry said, 'Dusty, you look absolutely wretched!', and it turns out that he had been awake for twenty-four hours, because at this point in the movie, his character had been, so Larry replied, 'Oh, Dusty, why don't you just try acting?', and the American retorted, 'Act on this, you British fag,' and Larry replied, 'I asked for a meal, not a snack!'So perhaps Steve Martin made up the end of that story, but the beginning is true. Dustin was a true method actor, and by the end of the film, it's clearly evident that Dustin is indeed quite tired, both mentally and physically. I doubt whether acting could unleash the same sort of deadness that shines through in Babe had Hoffman simply tried acting.Another arguable fact is that this is Laurence Olivier's most famous role. It's certainly his most villainous. It's a career highlight; in a role that many critics called Olivier's finest hour, and I think should certainly be remembered as his most devilish. Is it safe? Is it safe? Every time it's spoken it sends a shiver down my spine.Two very important films of Dustin Hoffman's career came out in 1976 All the President's Men and, of course, Marathon Man. They are both universally regarded as some of his best work, and it's not a surprising fact, really, since it's true that they really *are* some of his best work. (Quite incidentally, the renowned William Goldman wrote both screenplays, and the latter of the two titles was based on his own novel.)Thrillers of such striking power and ferocity are rarely made nowadays in Hollywood. Marathon Man is cold, hard, gritty and dirty, and one of the best of the genre. It's a modern-day masterpiece, perhaps barely short of greatness, but a masterpiece nonetheless. You may never want to go to the dentist again.It's safe to say that Marathon Man is a terrific movie.4.5\/5 stars.- John Ulmer ","genre":null},{"date":"13 March 2004","score":"31 out of 57 people found the following review useful","review":"  Have you ever gone to a dentist before?

Believing that Doc may have spilled the beans to Babe, Svell kidnaps the college graduate and this is where the famous torture scene starts. Is it safe? Is it safe? Is...it...safe...?I don't know what you're talking about!Marathon Man is often considered a classic of the thriller genre, and it certainly is. It has its flaws, and sometimes it seems a bit average from a technical viewpoint, but it set the stage for many gritty, coarse thrillers that would follow in later years. It is still arguably one of the greatest of them all.The title comes from the fact that Hoffman's character, Babe, is a marathon jogger. He runs every single day, and so when he finally manages to escape from Szell's grasp, you can imagine what a hard time they have chasing after him. In retrospect, the title takes on two different (and ironic) indications.The well-known story about Olivier's advice to Hoffman on the set of the film has been referenced many times (even by Steve Martin in Saturday Night Live), so it almost seems pointless to divulge into it. Basically, in the words of Steve Martin, Hoffman came to the set one day looking absolutely wretched, and Sir Larry said, 'Dusty, you look absolutely wretched!', and it turns out that he had been awake for twenty-four hours, because at this point in the movie, his character had been, so Larry replied, 'Oh, Dusty, why don't you just try acting?', and the American retorted, 'Act on this, you British fag,' and Larry replied, 'I asked for a meal, not a snack!'So perhaps Steve Martin made up the end of that story, but the beginning is true. Dustin was a true method actor, and by the end of the film, it's clearly evident that Dustin is indeed quite tired, both mentally and physically. I doubt whether acting could unleash the same sort of deadness that shines through in Babe had Hoffman simply tried acting.Another arguable fact is that this is Laurence Olivier's most famous role. It's certainly his most villainous. It's a career highlight; in a role that many critics called Olivier's finest hour, and I think should certainly be remembered as his most devilish. Is it safe? Is it safe? Every time it's spoken it sends a shiver down my spine.Two very important films of Dustin Hoffman's career came out in 1976 All the President's Men and, of course, Marathon Man. They are both universally regarded as some of his best work, and it's not a surprising fact, really, since it's true that they really *are* some of his best work. (Quite incidentally, the renowned William Goldman wrote both screenplays, and the latter of the two titles was based on his own novel.)Thrillers of such striking power and ferocity are rarely made nowadays in Hollywood. Marathon Man is cold, hard, gritty and dirty, and one of the best of the genre. It's a modern-day masterpiece, perhaps barely short of greatness, but a masterpiece nonetheless.

Of course you have. (Unless you're British!) And that's why the torture scene in Marathon Man is arguably the most famous of all mainstream torture scenes. Even the infamous ear segment in Reservoir Dogs fails to relate to people around the world the same way as this does. Not everyone has had his or her ear chopped off.Anyone who has gone to a dentist before can relate to the fear and excruciating pain that Babe (Dustin Hoffman) experiences when he is asked, Is it safe? and has no idea what his interrogator is talking about, then finds himself being given a root canal without any Novocain.The interrogator is Szell (Laurence Olivier), a dreaded German murderer who carried out awful deeds during World War II and offered Jews a free ticket out--for a hefty price.Szell's question (Is it safe?) exists because he needs to know whether or not it is safe to withdraw diamonds he stole from Jews during World War II from a safety deposit box. As the film opens, Szell's brother dies in a car crash, which sets up this entire aspect of the plot, since his brother had the key to the vault.Babe's brother, Doc (Roy Scheider, JAWS), comes to visit him in New York City, but turns up at his apartment with stab wounds.

Still, the movie never gets to be seriously boring; there are a few decent action scenes, and the goofiness of ninjas bouncing the story around does give the movie an entertaining cheesiness. Plus, there is the presence of Steve James, who (despite his limited time) really gives a likable and entertaining performance, and gets to show his genuine martial arts skills.

An all-star cast, wonderful direction, top notch screenplay and suspenceful score. Of course, as 'history' we all know JFK is quite seriously flawed, but does that really matter? it's only a movie after all. Personally, I loved it. I've read the long and eloquent reviews of others and there's no point just repeating what other folks have already said, so here's my 'take' on the murder of President Kennedy. MY theory is that Lee Harvey Oswald was suffering from undiagnosed Aspergers Syndrome; a minor form of Autism. Look it up on the internet (if you're interested). It's the only thing - for me - that explains his character. Oswald was a highly intelligent man, but without focus. His (self taught) Russian was not only fluent but perfect. He joined the US Marine Corps, but was attracted to Communism and he was active in both the pro and anti castro movements. I think Oswald was involved in the murder (somehow) but my conclusion is he wasn't the only shooter and probably not a shooter at all. I think there WAS a conspiracy and shadowy people far more streetwise than Oswald easily picked him out as a tailor-made fall guy. Just a few hours before his death JFK said We're heading into nut country today. Dallas was a 'hostile' city, so how come his security was so lax? And despite the movie's many inaccuracies it did get one vital thing right. Back and to the left. Back and to the left. The final shot which killed the President could never have been fired from behind the car. The anti conspiracy theorists always put forward the notion that (if it was a conspiracy) someone would've eventually confessed. I'd say, confessed to what? This movie presents the conspiracy as maddeningly 'vague' and I think that's bang on the nail. Each person involved would've only known as much as they needed to. No one person could ever prove anything. I was born 2 months after event, but my parents both told me they wept when they heard President Kennedy had been killed, just like many millions of people. despite his well documented sexual flaws I think JFK was a great man who could've given so much to the world.

This movie that isn't worth solving because no matter how much work you put in, I am sure I would find parts left over. There is no answer only theories.I am sad that the chance of a great movie has been wasted rather like a man stranded on a dessert island that has chopped up a boat to make a raft out of it. He prefers a raft to a boat - but should he be applauded for it? ","genre":"Drama, Mystery, Thriller"}]
