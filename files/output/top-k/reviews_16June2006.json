[{"date":"16 June 2006","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Outside of Providence is the kind of movie you put on when your bored or you've seen everything else. The movie itself isn't that raunchy or crude nor that funny. But outside of providence has it's moments most of the scenes with Jon Abrams as Drugs Delaney will get a few laughs but what my personally favorite parts in this film were the hilarious annual poker games with Alec Baldwin and his friends, every time they played cards i laughed out loud. I don't think the movie was written like most farrelly bros movies with a laugh a minute movie but this is rather more relaxed and it's an easy film to digest, once you leave you'll probably feel good about yourself. In conclusion, if you like easy and nice movies or you're just in the mood then give this one a try. One more thing although there is no sex in the film there is a lot of profanity and A lot of drug use (Smoking) and there is a scene of some sexual dialog so this isn't a family film either.
