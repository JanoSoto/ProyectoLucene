[{"date":"25 May 2008","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Youthful variation on The Stepford Wives (and perhaps even The Parallax View) has square-jawed James Marsden--a jock-equivalent of Tom Cruise--playing a high school misfit (!), relocated East from Chicago and finding a clique of sweater-wearing, easy listening-loving teenagers to be more dangerous than they first appear. In a movie about kid-zombies, Marsden is the biggest fake of all; with the built-in apologia that his character has gone off-course because of his brother's suicide, it is still completely unacceptable for model-perfect Marsden to be palmed off as a have-not (he'd be readily accepted at any high school, and the stoners who befriend him here wouldn't stand a chance). It's a disastrous piece of casting, not helped by the slang-heavy dialogue, sounding as if it were written by a high school drop-out armed with a thesaurus. Katie Holmes attempts to smolder as another hellion, complete with nose-ring, but her jaded eye-rolls and expressions don't do much for her or the picture. The heavy whiff of cynicism throughout is daunting; and though the movie is remarkably well-produced, it hasn't an original thought or idea in its head. *1\/2 from **** ","genre":null},{"date":"25 May 2008","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Youthful variation on The Stepford Wives (and perhaps even The Parallax View) has square-jawed James Marsden--a jock-equivalent of Tom Cruise--playing a high school misfit (!), relocated East from Chicago and finding a clique of sweater-wearing, easy listening-loving teenagers to be more dangerous than they first appear.
