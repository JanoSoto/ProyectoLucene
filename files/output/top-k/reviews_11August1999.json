The kind of wealth that is reserved for the likes of Bill Gates or Donald Trump, yet they lack what Mr. Crown has, the looks and the cahrm to be a true playboy.  How many of us would love to have an infinite supply of money to go around so that we can wreck a boat if we feel like it just because we enjoy the thrill of the ride?  It is small moments like this that are fun.  Most of us will never know what it is like to make 30 million dollars in one business acquisition or what it is like to be chauffered around in a Mercedes and then flying off to some exotic island and spend the night at your own private beach house with a beautiful naked woman.  So living vicariously through the characters in this movie is half the fun.  And fun the movie is.  It is not a great movie but it is not boring either.Thomas Crown is a wealthy finance guy in the business world and he also collects fine art.  When he sees his opportunity to steal one of the most expensive pieces at the local art museum, he jumps all over it.  His plan is rather brilliant as well.  But then we meet Catherine ( Russo ).  She is hired by the firm that insures the painting to do a little investigating before they decide to shell out 100 million dollars.  And it is here that the movie fails.  Not so much that it is Russo playing the part, but how the part is written.  The character here is a little too head strong and she is a little too confident and she figures things out a little too quickly and she has all the answers a little too quickly.  That is my big problem with film.  I found that Russo's character to be not believable and seeing as she is one of the two major characters in the film, that possesses a problem.  When you can't like one of your stars then the rest of the film has a damper put on it.  There are also a few scenes that I found to be much to silly for the Thomas Crown character.  Some of what he does is just plain dumb and even though you get to understand that he likes a challenge more than anything in life, I just don't buy the fact that he would reveal some of the things that he does.  Also a complete waste in here was the Faye Dunaway character.  Her role is useless and it feels like they just put it into the film so they could have an original actor from the first film.But what is fun is some of the cat and mouse that ensues.  Catherine is so sure that Crown has the painting that she becomes obsessed with finding out, and in the process she jeapordizes her career, not that you would know that judging by her carefree attitude.  Some of what she does in here she would never get away with in real life.  All in all, the film had a good beginning, a terrific end but the middle was lacking.  It was sometimes boring and slow.  But it still worth seeing.  And the final conclusion of how he gets himself out of or into more trouble is really quite smartly written.  See this film during a matinee and try to enjoy it for what it is, and that is a look into a life that none of us will probably ever have.  But it sure is fun to pretend.

It's one of my all-time favorite horror movies.  And guess what?  You don't hear the F-Word (****) you've all heard before in this one AT ALL!  It's great.  Aside from the lack of a lot of nasty language, there was a good, sturdy plot with great acting, good special effects (they look great, because this was filmed before computerized special effects came into the film scene) and a good story.  The story involves Carol Anne (Heather O'Rourke, who died about 3 months before the film's release) coming to live with her Aunt Pat (she hates to be called Trish) and Uncle Bruce (Nancy Allen and Tom Skerrit) and cousin Donna (Lara Flynn Boyle in her first performance).  Well, Kane's found her again! And he won't settle for NOT having her.  Watch in suspense as Allen and Skerrit travel through a maze of illusions conjured by Kane!

But in this fourth installment, the writers of the film had ran out of original ideas on what the villains should be like (in this case Mr. Freeze and Poison Ivy).  There was just no innovation on how Freeze and Ivy would take over Gotham; they were just using ice and plants to terrorize people, nothing else.What can I say about the story?  Just plain childish.  I have already mentioned Freeze and Ivy, but what about Batman & Robin??  I couldn't find anything new about their relationship other than their partnership.  And the dialogue?? I don't even want to go there.But Batgirl is something quite new (and cute).  In the movie, she's still Barbara, but she's Alfred's (the butler) niece, instead of the commissioner's daughter.  I also enjoyed the motorcycle race scene in which she tries to...well, I don't want to give that away.But overall, the movie can't live up to the standards of the three previous films which has the genius of the villains; it's overridden by the special effects and lame attempts of comedy that only a 7-year-old would laugh (then again, I don't know if he\/she is even mature enough to understand).Advice to the writers of the next film (if any) Make Batman for who he really is serious, stubborn, aggressive, and controlling.  Also make the images dark again to capture the dark emotions of the Bat, and include the Scarecrow for a scare.

This movie was way way way bloated with cliched dialogue, actors hammering out every banal word, zero charisma, and poor characterizations.How much more meaningful it would have been with a normal relaxed human pacing, off-hand unself-conscious line delivery, not so heavy-handed confusion of one whore with another and a truly meaningfully vested characterization of the wife role.How about a (younger) Annette Bening in the role (?Renee Zellweger)? Give the wife some warmth, a quality of having deep and easy capacity to love and be loved, a genuine emotional involvement as a mother .... instead of a detached neuraesthenic shell.  How interesting it then would have been to see her inability to repress her involuntary fantasies of passionate devastation.  Then we could understand the husband's struggle with her dreams.
