Beginning from a masterpiece best picture winner to a popular 70's and 80's franchise, this film goes to no boundaries of greatness. It, along with its followers, are all brilliant. Definitely one of the best franchises ever!The story centers on south paw boxer tough guy Rocky Balboa,(Sylvester Stallone) who although gets paid doing boxing matches here and there, along with collecting money for a collector, can't make anything out of his career, or his life. Then, he finally gets his chance at turning his life around when he is challenged by Heavy Weight Champion Apollo Creed, who gives him the one shot at the biggest title in history. Rocky then prepares himself for the fight of his life, with his trainer Mickey, (Burgess Meredith), and his girlfriend, Adrian, (Talia Shire).The movie outdoes itself in almost every area. Its editing, directing, casting\/acting, and just everything else in general. It gives itself an emotional feel, letting you feel comfortable with the movie, and feeling for the characters. Half the movie shows what Rocky's life is like everyday, showing his everyday activities. Then, the other half consists of being challenged, and getting prepared.The characters are some of best, classic characters of all time. Stallone gives an amazing Oscar nominated performance, along with a top billing cast. Talia Shire, as Adrian, gives a great performance as Rocky's incredibly shy, but very supporting girlfriend. Burt Young as Paulie, (Adrian's sister) plays a very bitter character as a abusively angered brother who always likes to yell. Burgess Meredith, as Rocky's bitter and broken down mentor, Mickey, is one of the most classic and greatest performances of all time. Mickey is an icon of movies, and he just completes the drama in the Rocky movies.The build up to the fight is also amazing, for you are rooting for Rocky all the way, and seeing him tense and nervous, just makes you wanna see him go all the way. Although the opponent, Apollo Creed, (Carl Weathers) isn't considered a bad guy, you still wanna see Rocky beat him down.The film is the absolute classic underdog film that is brilliant to no end. It is and will always be considered one of the best films ever made, especially in my book. Its epic, its amazing, and it will have you on your feet to the very end.

He cannot focus at school, he dislikes his home life and his parents' constant bickering, and he has an uncanny knack for getting into troublesome situations. This story arc is based in part on Truffaut's own childhood, only to be saved by the cinema and its open invitation of stability and security.While being widely considered as the starting point for the French New Wave, a watermark moment in film history, this film at its most basic level is essentially the story of a young boy attempting to find the place in which he fits most comfortably. Perhaps the most striking characteristic of the film is Jean-Pierre Leaud's face, which is so simple and understandable in its emotional tone and perception that we are never once aware of him as an actor portraying a role. He is this character of Antoine Doinel in every sense. Truffaut also was able to showcase his genius of genuine film-making. A devoted defender of the auteur theory, no other director made this theory more believable. Every shot, every camera angle, every scene bursts with the excitement and joy of film; this is a most rare characteristic. This is certainly a Truffaut film; no one else could instill such rhapsody of life and living. Despite the downbeat material, there is a remarkable sense of a new beginning. Indeed, this was a new beginning for Truffaut's life. And we are more than happy to go along for the ride with him.

Well was it good......well before I answer lets go over some things. Is this considered to be a good movie, no, is this an indy movie, well technically yes, is it a classic well lets wait to answer that one. So this movie is designed to appeal to a very specific demographic, that is young mostly white stoners. In that regard this movie both ranks as a cult classic and a great movie within the genre. However, in the general sense no its garbage. However, if you are a coming of age stoner in the year 3000 and you uncover this blog in doing research for a school report on how people lived before worm holes were used for space travel, well take out your nuclear powered vaporizer and enter the holochamber and ask your computer to play this stoner madcap romp. And if you are in this century check out a bit role for a then unknown Tracy Morgan.
