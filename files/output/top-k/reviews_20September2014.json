But they soon find themselves being pursued by a mysterious masked man who's gaining on their trail.Rob Reiner has directed some well-known classics (A Few Good Men, Stand by Me & When Harry Met Sally...) but most people are still not familiar with his name because unlike other filmmakers, he has no unique style of shooting a film or possesses a trademark. And this is another one of his films that's pretty different in style & approach when compared to his other works. And Reiner does a good job at it.The screenplay is adapted from the book of the same name in a manner that preserves its narrative style, camera-work & editing nicely compliment each other, visuals effects never aims for a realistic portrayal of the world depicted in the story plus it benefits very much from its sweet, tender & pleasant performances from its cast, including Andre the Giant.On an overall scale, there isn't much wrong with The Princess Bride & carries out most of its elements the way it's meant to be. More entertaining than what I was expecting from it, definitely showing a lot of heart, warmth & charm and yet it didn't click enough with me for I'm not really a fan of fairy tales.

Aside from the points in the title of this review, in real life Anastasia died with the rest of the Romanov family on July 17, 1918 in Ekaterinburg, Russia when they were all shot by order of Vladimir Lenin himself. So any and all criticisms about the historical inaccuracy of the film are ultimately superfluous.Harsh reality aside, this animated adaptation of the 1956 film of the same name holds up pretty well after all these years. The story of a young girl being picked up by con men who want to pass her off as the Duchess and claim the Tsar's fortune is nothing new. But Don Bluth and crew manage to make it surprisingly refreshing with some bright colors, fun characters, mild but tense action scenes, and one of the most perfect love stories I've seen. Heck, the romantic leads don't even say I love you once; they leave it entirely up to the animation, the music, and the superb voice acting. THAT is what film is supposed to be showing instead of telling.The characters are great, better than some in the Disney movies this film borrows from. Anastasia herself is a wide-eyed but hopeful woman whose banter with Dmitri, a con man who's afraid of admitting he's not such a bad guy after all, is the best part of the movie. Vlad is a lovable yet hopeless romantic, thus the perfect best friend for Dmitri. Angela Lansbury as The Dowager Empress Marie is, well, Angela Lansbury. Nothing that new, but NEVER anything bad.And then we have Christopher Lloyd as Rasputin. He's... 50\/50. Sometimes I buy him as this hate-filled, despicably evil sorcerer, other times my mind momentarily flashes to Christoper Lloyd in a recording booth. And most of his scenes are plagued by Bartok the Bat, voiced by Hank Azaria. Bartok's not annoying or anything, but given that he does all of ONE thing in the film, his presence is no doubt due to the producers feeling that Rasputin and his awesome villain song were too scary. Gee, a villain that scares people? UNACCEPTABLE!Aside from In the Dark of the Night, the rest of the songs in the movie aren't that memorable. They're not BAD songs by any stretch, they just don't go as far with the lyrics or the tune as Rasputin's villain song. The only one I remember distinctly was Once Upon a December, and only by name. But, seriously, why isn't David Newman getting more work these days? His score in this film was spectacular, enough to give Alan Menken a run for his money.Overall, while it may not my favorite movie or the the BEST movie I've seen, there's nothing really to hate about this film.

Largely keeping away from giving the movie any hint of doom & gloom,Hitchcock perfectly matches the brisk nature of the screenplay by wrapping the title in a light 'N fluffy atmosphere,with Hitchcock using excellent,long-take tracking shots which display the deep sense of unease that Burgoyne's family have around each other.For their extremely loose adaptation of Elizabeth Mackintosh's novel A Shilling for Candles, (with the writers only following one-third of the book,and then going off in their own direction)writers (deep breath!) Charles Bennett, Edwin Greenwood, Anthony Armstrong, Gerald Savory and Alma Reville expertly balance the films frantic man on the run with a joyful comedic edge,which goes from the sly, (a group of cops sitting in the back of a tractor filled with pigs) to the more overt,as Tisdall and Burorgoyne strike with rapid-fire,almost Screwball Comedy dialogue.Along with the lively comedic dialogue,the writers always make sure to keep the delightful murder mystery bubbling along,as Burgoyne goes from bring desperate to take Tisdall to the cops,to being determined to track down the murderous owner of the missing coat.Meeting her future husband on the film,the pretty Nova Pilbeam gives an excellent performance as Burorgoyne,with Pilbeam giving the character a charming shot of sass,which shines across the screen as Buroygoyne starts to get close to Tisdall.Finding his scroll on the beach to be one that could end in a murder rep, Derrick De Marney gives a fantastic performance as Tisdall,as Marney shows desperation in Tisdall's eyes to clear his name,whilst also bouncing off fast one-liners with Burorgoyne,in a film that remains young & innocent.

Largely keeping away from giving the movie any hint of doom & gloom,Hitchcock perfectly matches the brisk nature of the screenplay by wrapping the title in a light 'N fluffy atmosphere,with Hitchcock using excellent,long-take tracking shots which display the deep sense of unease that Burgoyne's family have around each other.For their extremely loose adaptation of Elizabeth Mackintosh's novel A Shilling for Candles, (with the writers only following one-third of the book,and then going off in their own direction)writers (deep breath!)

Extremely well written and well acted, this is in fact a testimony of writing. All films have to be driven by writing more than anything else. Simply shot, the dialogue makes up for everything here. There are many things that could have been shown like it happens in other courtroom dramas, that is I mean the whole trial, the evidences, the arguments. But here, the trial is over only the judgment of the jury is pending which is 11-1 from the word go and in all expectation should have been 12-0 in favor of guilty. Now, that does not make a good character of the man who stood out. That 1 man has to influence all the 11 others to become an outstanding man from a mere standing out person.

In 1986, when this film was released, nobody was willing to trust the idea of human teleportation as most people were much too scared to even imagine the concept of sitting in a box to come out of another box. Hence, in 2014, nobody would doubt that watching 'The Fly' nearly three decades after its initial release would turn out to be an extremely strange experience for loyal David Cronenberg admirers as well as for viewers who possess little knowledge about his visionary films.

One must watch The Fly bearing this fundamental quote in mind as a lot has changed in our world especially in the way horror films are continuing to influence public opinion in last few years. The reason why The Fly continues to hold sway is that it was one of the initial films to suggest that all sciences are not good and some sciences can even have bad effects on human societies. What makes The Fly revolutionary as well as groundbreaking is its inclusion of ideas and innovations on which people are working in 21st century. As examples, one can mention the sensitive issues of abortion and human cloning.

The film is a true masterpiece, expressing a profound and accurate statement about friendship and betrayal, with superb acting, writing, directing and music, and as all these components come together what you get is a true work of art that will last the test of time. Once upon a time in America really makes you examine your own life and how regrets can be a dangerous thing. In my opinion Once upon a time in America is Sergio Leone's best work as there has never been anything like this gangster epic and unlikely to be ever again. One of the most touching scenes for me is where there is an instrumental version of 'Yesterday' (by John Lennon and Paul McCartney), where Noodles life is in flashbacks and all the regrets come flooding back to him.

Now, you have half job done, the best work is written, but Robert Mulligan as a director has to handle a tougher task, he has to bring a well written and much known work with life and living characters onto the screen. Man, he does this job with flying colors. Firstly, the acting be it a Tom Robinson or a Mayella or a lesser known Cunningham, all have done exceptionally well. Above all stands, Gregory Peck as Atticus Finch, a disciplined father and a lovable one indeed. He brings life to a character of rare dignity that is realistic yet ideal. Told through the eyes of a small girl Jean Finch, this story is one good one to hear or see. It has many moments that give us a lump in the throat. The climax is a befitting one and is symbolism of Natures judgement. The courtroom acting of Tom Robinson and Finch and Mayella is enough to say that even for a brief 20 minutes of courtroom scene, this movie is still considered as one of the best courtroom dramas. That was the power and passion involved in the making.Acting and writing both are sublime and all else just falls in place, be it art direction or background score, they would have been good anyways, with the acting that we see it is obvious why it is hailed as a textbook for classic acting and same is the case with writing too.I loved it and am hopeful any one who see it will. Neighbors bring food with death and flowers with sickness and little things in between. Boo was our neighbor. He gave us two soap dolls, a broken watch and chain,a knife and our lives. That dialogue summarizes most of the movie. But the very point that is being said is humanism, we alienate humans with our own prejudices, be it a beggar or a toilet cleaner even guards at offices are not treated as humans as we feel as if we are above them, there is only color and it colorless, there is only one caste and religion that is humanity. It's a 5\/5 without any doubt and please request all to see it. Have patience though, we have to endure it. Watch it for acting and writing above everything else.

Jake LaMotta, played by Roert De Niro, is a boxer and a talented one at that. But he is emotionally unstable outside the ring to his family and friends. He has violent bouts of paranoia and jealousy that is a common denominator in all his relationships and it is because of this way that he treats people he becomes lonely. My favourite scene from the movie is the beautiful and iconic opening scene, that is just sad, and you just know by seeing the opening scene that you are in for something special. Raging Bull is certainly one of the best films that Scorsese has directed, and one of the most important of his career. This and Taxi Driver, are two of Scorsese movies that will stand the test of time for years and years to come. I really liked Raging Bull and I would consider it as one of my favourite movies that I have ever seen, for me it is the best movie about boxing because it is a realistic portrayal in that it shows you that been a boxer is not just about the fame and money but it shows you the harder lifestyle of a boxer in terms of what effect boxing can have on your body and mind. The saddest scene for me in Raging Bull is where Jake is rehearsing the famous Marlon Brando speech from On the Waterfront, in which he says without emotion in front of the mirror You should've looked out for me a little bit.

It's the pinnacle of the Horror genre and a film not to be missed.Chainsaw-wielding Leatherface remains one of the most disturbing characters in horror. Artfully documentary like and shot under conditions that produced genuinely traumatized performances, the original Massacre eschews cheap thrills and attacks the psyche.A profoundly sensitive look at social prejudices and the toll said prejudices take on the human social organism.

When someone mentions the 'Mad Max' saga, it tends to evoke images of a post-apocalyptic wasteland filled with guys in S&M gear, but that's not the case in the first film. Tonally and stylistically 'Mad Max' is really more of a Spaghetti Western. The geopolitics of how and why things have decayed are a bit sketchy. It's clear there's been some sort of breakdown, whether national or global, but there's still some semblance of society here. I liked being thrown into this world without things being explained and trying to get my bearings. It reminded me of 'Star Wars' in that way.The driving action is poetic. White lines and blacktop flow by almost dreamily, without any of the Cuisinart editing we tend to associate with car oriented action films today. The cast is amazing. It's not so much that any of them are great actors (apart from Gibson, though he isn't asked to do much here), but each and every one look as if they just stepped out of the pages of a comic book and they play their roles to the absolute hilt.Though it's narratively wonky and drags a bit at times, even with its brief 95 minute runtime, 'Mad Max' remains a very compelling film, even apart from its significance as a genre defining\/creating icon.
