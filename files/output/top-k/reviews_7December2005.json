A robot that wants to be a man, we have seen some nice tries for that one... However, I was happily surprised how cleverly the whole thing was built up from step to step. Of course you cannot completely forget that it is a tale, but I almost did! I never felt the steps of the robot on the ladder of becoming a man too sudden. Always baby steps, therefore the whole thing became more or less believable.The other important thing that this movie has tons of LOVE. Not love between man and woman. Love between persons. It is very rare, I think. Films introduce love in the form of some kind of passion, and all the emotions are built upon that passion. I don't say that's bad, but I doubt that love is all about that. It was a relief to see a movie where love between man and woman is also based upon something else friendship. Beautiful! And this friendship filled every second of the movie. It gave a very warm atmosphere around the basic story of the robot becoming a man.Some say that every movie has to have at least one bad guy, otherwise it is boring. I totally disagree with that. It it so good to find a movie where every main character is good. This is one of those movies.Finally, the ending is positive. I feel it important to mention because in my opinion it is really hard to make a movie beautiful AND with happy ending in the same time. That's why most of the beautiful stories end sadly. This one doesn't. Congratulations to the director!

Timeless you might say.The film follows three widely different species of mammal as they seek to return a Human child to his people.They are Manfred the mammoth, Sid the sloth, and Diego the sabre-toothed tiger. They go through several testing adventures together, an experience which is often fertile soil for the making of strong friendships. Here is no exception since they come to refer to themselves as the herd.I think the choice of mammoth as one of the child's saviours is a wise one since there have been allegorical tales of their surviving relatives, the elephants extending a level of concern beyond their own species.There is one very touching scene which takes place within a cave which Humans have perhaps used for generations to reflect and meditate on their place in the world. It is daubed with paintings of various animals, among which are mammoths being hunted. We are witness though to what appears to be a bond and an understanding between the child and Manfred, that their friendship transcends such concerns.Sid looks like a caricature rather than a real sloth, and most of Diego's feline pride also look caricatured. That said, I simply love the animation of the characters, and the level of observation which has obviously gone into living cats, pachyderms and Humans. Diego does the cat-crawl, and Manfred uses his trunk with absolute sensitivity, as would his latter day relatives.If you have young children show them this film, they'll love it. If you don't have children don't worry. See it anyway, and remember that friendship and responsibility frequently extends to those of another species.

The night of the experiment arrives & Nelson along with David Labraccio (Kevin Bacon), Rachel Mannus (Julia Roberts), Joe Hurley (William Baldwin) & Randy Steckle (Oliver Platt) prepares to die, for a few seconds anyway. The experiment goes as well as could be expected with Nelson being successfully revived after being clinically dead for a short amount of time, the friends wax lyrical about all the fame, fortune & praise that will be heaped upon them by the media & medical professions. Joe is next to undergo the procedure as they need more data, then it's David & finally Rachel. However experiencing death & the afterlife first hand doesn't come without it's problems as past sins come back in physical manifestations to haunt & terrorise the friends. Somehow they must find a way to appease their sins, or be haunted by them forever more...Directed by Joel Schumacher I thought Flatliners was an OK way to pass a couple of hours but was nothing particularly special. The script by Peter Filardi moves along at a reasonable pace & isn't overly dull but it didn't really grip or engage me, I didn't really care about any of the character's or what was happening to them. The basic central idea behind Flatliners is quite original but the way it presents itself is rather lacklustre & it seems to have almost no ambition in tackling the issues it raises, the way Joe, Rachel & David overcome their past sins is very low key & Nelson has a ridiculous fight with his in the afterlife while he is dead but you just know his friends on the outside are going to revive him even though he's been dead for what seems like an eternity. Flatliners seems convinced that to make up for past sins all you have to do is confront them, apologise & that afterwards everything will be perfect, I thought Flatliners was a horror film not a feel-good Disney film! Flatliners obviously tries to say things about religion, the afterlife, past misdemeanours & friendship but it doesn't do a very good job. Oh, & as you would expect the clichéd romantic sub plot is present & correct. There's no real blood or gore & the only violence is Sutherland being beaten with a hockey-stick wielding psycho kid. One question though, why is a medical school situated in what looks like a Cathedral or Church, sure it's Gothic & it looks cool but it felt odd somehow.Director Schumacher doesn't know the meaning of the word subtle, he lights everything with bright neon colours usually cold icy blues & contrasting warm glowing oranges. The entire film looks so staged & forced when something more natural looking might have been better. Having said that the film does look sumptuous with some fantastic lighting & photography that gives Flatliners a classy feel throughout. Schumacher fails to generate much tension, atmosphere or surprise & really should have done more with cast & material he had. For some reason Schumacher depicts the afterlife with aerial shots of snow covered mountains & people running through grassy hillsides.With a supposed budget of about $26,000,000 Flatliners is technically excellent especially it's visual qualities. The special effects are good as is the music & it's generally a very well made film. The acting is pretty decent by a good cast but Kevin what's with that bad 80's hairdo?!Flatliners is an OK film, it won't knock your socks off or change your life but it's definitely worth at least one watch & you can probably catch it on TV all the time for free these days, like I did.

The dance sequences are spectacular, right from the opening audition scene to the final farewell and I loved the musical score.

This is a tribute to Schneider's acting and I can't think of any film where he has done better than this. All the acting is first rate but I was particularly impressed with Erzebet Foldi who played Gideon's young daughter. I don't know if she went anywhere after this film but she certainly deserved to.The film contains flashbacks to Gideon's earlier life interspersed with interludes where he converses with the angel of death, personified as a beautiful young woman and it's funny, sad and uplifting all at the same time. The dance sequences are spectacular, right from the opening audition scene to the final farewell and I loved the musical score. Some people may find certain sequences a bit raunchy and I remember this being an issue with a few parties at the time the film was released. All that I can say is that everything contributes to the overall story and I didn't find it a problem at all.It must be pretty obvious by now that I Liked this film and I did. I'm giving it a 10.

After one of the kids in the foster house gets brutally killed by another of the kids (Victor, played by Mark Venturini), bizarre killings begins to happen and Tommy starts to believe that Jason is still alive, but who is that possible? Who is killing people? Is it Victor? Tommy? or Jason? The story looks promising, and for the most part is well handled. The twist ending is very surprising but the explanation is kind of weak, which is one thing the fans complained. The movie has a good amount of suspense and while maybe not as gory as the other movies, it has a good amount of mystery surrounding Jason that keeps you thrilled until the end.The acting is kind of weak in the lead characters Tommy and Pam (Melanie Kinnaman), but the supporting cast is actually good and better than the leads. In fact, that is probably the reason of why by the middle of the movie the story focuses more in Reggie (Shavar Ross) than in Tommy.To summarize, this take was not very well received by fans, but I find it is unfair to dismiss it just because of the weak explanation of the twists it has.

I now understand that certain things should be left alone. I often have an affinity toward 70's movies , because they possess that rare charm that we almost never see in the post 2000 A.D. movies. I vaguely remember the popularity of this film as a child and that it launched two acting careers of the lead characters. As we all know, the story is told in redundant simplicity. Boy and girl meet in college. They spar, date, fall in love, marry, then she dies. All 100 minutes of this covers about 5 years of time and still seems to just drag. Ryan O'Neal as Oliver plays the Harvard rich kid of a wealthy magnate Oliver Barrett IV. He has no respect for his father and decides to rebel against his father's wishes of dating a girl who is beneath their social stature. Jenny played by Ali MacGraw is a glib music major at Radcliffe who falls in love with the boorish Oliver III. I didn't care one iota for either one of them and they had very little chemistry. The sentimental scenes were forced and had no spontaneity at all. The goofy 70's love montage of them playing in the snow and frolicking in the grass is about as corny as a tortilla chip. Oliver happens to drive an antique MG that looks so out of place, they both look dorky when driving through the traffic of the urban east coast. This is 1970!! Not 1932!!! A kid this rich should be given a cool muscle car like a Mustang, Corvette, Porsche or Ferrari. Not some flimsy, thin wheeled, open cockpit British jalopy. It just wasn't believable. Besides Ryan's acting in this is all wrong. His speech sounds affected like he was trying to use some upper class east coast accent. But it misfires and he just looks odd doing it. Ali MacGraw acts too poised and speaks too properly to pass as a tough Italian girl from humble upbringings. Their acting is not very good. The musical score however was very familiar to me, but it is overplayed a few times to much in this film. Twice would have been enough. Ray Milland gives a believable performance and he is the only real actor in this movie. Yes, he's snobbish, stuck-up and not the most likable guy. But at least he tried to make amends toward the end with young Oliver after Dad was completely rejected by him. Ali and Ryan make an attractive and sexy pair, but I would have preferred a couple with stronger chemistry.

The only thing that kept me going through the movie (and kept me from giving it a 1 or 2) was that the acting only sucked a little (I'm a Forest Whitaker fan), some scenes were a little interesting to watch, plus the curiosity of seeing the worst movie of the decade.

Overall, a good little film that should be more appreciated.Hedeen's Outlook 8\/10 *** B ","genre":"Adventure, Drama, Romance"},{"date":"7 December 2005","score":"3 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":" I only saw Logan's Run for the first time two nights ago, it was on cable, I loved it.

The dramatic-comedy Strawberry and Chocolate was directed by Tomás Gutiérrez Alea and Juan Carlos Tabío, and was an adaptation of the story The wolf, the forest, and the new man by Senel Paz. This movie represents very well the sentiment against homosexuality that still exists. Vladimir Cruz plays the part of David, the protagonist (the new man in Paz's words), and Jorge Perugorría plays the part of Diego (the wolf).The plot begins in Havana with David and his failed attempt to make love to his girlfriend, Vivian. It continues later on Vivian's wedding day with another man, while David watches them from the background. Depressed, David goes to the ice cream stand and meets Diego, who is clearly homosexual. Diego invites him to his apartment, but David flees suddenly because Diego is very strange. He later returns to the apartment because he is under the pressure of his roommate, Manuel, to investigate the queer. Friendship begins to grow between David and Diego. Diego is smart, knows a lot about art and culture, and teaches these things to his friend. The friendship between David and Nancy, one of Diego's friends, grows as well and they make love at the end of the movie. But, Diego is in trouble after sending a letter that ridicules the government for not accepting his art exhibition and, for this reason, the government kicks him out and he has to leave the country. The movie ends with a touching hug between Diego and David. I like the plot because it uses elements of comedy to demonstrate a serious theme, and I thing that this works well.There are two themes that clearly exist in this movie friendship and tolerance. True friendship can only exist when two people accept each other as they are; not only physically, but on the inside as well. For example, friendship is nonexistent between Manuel and David because Manuel doesn't care about David's personality, rather his actions. By the end, David and Diego adore each other for all the qualities they have, and do not worry about physical things. Tolerance is something different and is important as well. Many people in Cuba (demonstrated in Manuel) and other countries can't change their thoughts about homosexuality because they are too strong and unmovable. David's tolerance for Diego grows during the progression of the movie and it is realized at the end with a hug between friends.The use of light works well to show the mood of the movie. The darkness at the beginning shows the feeling that they are doing something bad or dirty, and the brightness when David and Diego are in the hideout (Diego's apartment) at the end of the movie shows that things will be fine. The acting is good and adds to the movie. Sometimes, Perugorría's acting is too cheesy, but it works to show his strange character. Through Cruz's good acting, one can clearly see David's emotional growth with his new friendship with Diego, the strange guy.In reality, people do not accept a change from the norm, and this is true especially with homosexuality. Homosexuals still fight today in many countries for their rights, but many people still don't accept them. This movie shows us very well this feeling through drama but also with a few moments of humor. I would recommend this to my friends because it isn't too serious, but nonetheless has a moving message for the viewer.

Oh before I start, its not just the film that is a homage to past musicals, but the song (along with many of the others in the film) is popular in two other films. Anyway, basically it is 1927, Don Lockwood (Gene Kelly, starring, directing and staging the musical numbers) is one of Hollywood's biggest stars, along with his annoying voiced co-star of his new picture, Lina Lamont (Oscar nominated Jean Hagen). Warner Bros. have created the first talking motion picture, or talkie, and all other studios are joining in, including Don's current studio, who have decided to turn his new upcoming silent film, The Duelling Cavalier, into the first talking musical, The Dancing Cavalier. Don has the perfect voice, where as Lina obviously ruins it, so they get a new star to replace her voice, who Don has already met and become very close to, Kathy Selden (Debbie Reynolds). Cosmo Brown (Golden Globe winning Donald O'Connor, kind of like another Sir Norman Wisdom or Lee Evans) is also a part of the act, not just as Don's best friend and help in production, but at showing him and others his great, and often hilarious abilities. In the end, the film, after all its trouble in production, is a success, Kathy is revealed as the true great singing voice of Lina, and she stars with Don in a new motion picture (shown on poster). The story has taken great songs from other musicals, there are great colours and staged dances, including that one where Kelly is imagining a part of his new film where he wants to be a dancer, and eventually runs into Cyd Charisse. The cheerful Good Morning was number 72, the hilarious Make 'Em Laugh was number 49, and of the course, the key sequence of the film, Kelly's solo dance routine showing a character's true love and expression of this, Singin' in the Rain was number 3 on 100 Years, 100 Songs.

It is just so memorable and funny. The story, that a man has to relive the same day over and over makes for a great movie. Of course, casting Bill Murray helped the film-he delivered the lines with the correct facial expressions and air. I thought it was good that the film started Murray off as a somewhat bitter(or mean)weather man who thinks he is a celebrity. Phil Connors treats everyone as if they are there to do his bidding. The trip to Punxsawtawnee changes Phil's life and his perception of life.I really liked the way the film developed the story. Every day that passes (even though each passing day is the same day)changes Phil. At first he is in disbelief; then he is awed at the things he can get away with (mostly theft);then he is desperate to end his misery;and then finally, he tries to use his situation to better the life of the people in Punxsawtawnee. He learned that once he got to really know people and to help them any way he could, he could make his own life better.These are the reasons why I really like Groundhog Day. Every time I watch it, I always enjoy it.

It is just so memorable and funny. The story, that a man has to relive the same day over and over makes for a great movie. Of course, casting Bill Murray helped the film-he delivered the lines with the correct facial expressions and air. I thought it was good that the film started Murray off as a somewhat bitter(or mean)weather man who thinks he is a celebrity. Phil Connors treats everyone as if they are there to do his bidding. The trip to Punxsawtawnee changes Phil's life and his perception of life.I really liked the way the film developed the story.
