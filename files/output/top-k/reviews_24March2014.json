With a yes absurd plot, it is fun and has all the elements Bond had in those days and includes all what we expect from Bond as well, plus we see some of the most memorable things from the Bond film series. I felt this film was safely a Good film and below is why I felt that about it.The story is as I say an absurd plot and if you watch this you will see what I mean. A villain to match Blofeld, the film boats big things and does it well with stunts, great fight sequences and some fantastic sets and locations. I did feel the pace was medium, not too fast but when it gets slow it suddenly speeds up again and is just pure if not occasionally silly entertainment, but nevertheless is really entertaining. Finally the story is also witty with Bond's humour shining through and making the film fun even with such horrible villains around all the time.Moore is at his best here and by many miles he acts best in this one with a solid performance that can seriously be classed as a rival to Connery. The film has many women who you are not sure if they are the Bond girl or not but it yet again is solid for Bond and his girls because whoever he is with, he suddenly has chemistry and Bond hasn't like the girl this much in years. I did feel the support and villain were sometimes over the top but look over it all and the film is hugely enjoyable and acted well.The sets and props used are marvellous and some of the best if not the best ever, even compared to more modern Bonds, Ken Adam does a wonderful job and sometimes, just sometimes you can enjoy the sets more than the plot going on. Jaws of course is a character I can't not comment on and his teeth are a work of greatness and a thing in this movie that in just one of the unforgettable moments and props, such as a certain underwater car that may or may not be used in this film.The film has it's more dull moments and can drag just a little at times but it doesn't make you hate this film or anything, it makes up for it in the end. I did feel that although I felt it was a good movie, it cannot move upwards much because it just isn't great or very good enough to go there and succeed until the end, some will love this I bet, but I know for a certain fact that some would give this 1\/10 because they hated it that much, it is worth a watch to see what you think though.Bond film fans I feel will and should be pleased by this as it doesn't run away from the Bond usual's but puts a nice twist on them all and makes them more fun and humorous to suit Roger Moore's portrayal of Bond. People should also enjoy this for it's varied action, adventure and crime which is the personification of Bond films really and always let people enjoy the film.A 7\/10 from me as I felt it was safely a good film but was nowhere near a very good film, but it started to pull way from being just Kind of Good. Just watch it, see through the more cheesy lines and just enjoy Moore at his best, also those who like Moore's bond the most should love this as this has to be his best as I said, just see what you think go with the flow and see the memorable most recognisable Bond movies for years.

Trouble is, of course, is that as I can enjoy a poorly made film that has some verve, some spark or originality, similarly I can not particularly enjoy a well made film. Case in point, Sexy Beast. Gruelling, dynamic and ferocious but nothing original about the story and lots of cockney nastiness and stupidity. Has to be said that the performances are very good. I thought perhaps Ian McShane might be the scariest of the three and had no idea Ben Kingsley would whip up his given dialogue and not just spit it out so much as vomit it all over the place.

The experience I had with this movie the first time I saw it was, pun-intended, vertigo-inducing. Vertigo was only the second Hitchcock film I saw and I wish somebody had warned me of what I was to expect. At the end, the first thing I said was holy crap. If asked point-blank, I couldn't have been able to tell you whether I liked it or not because there were elements I liked and elements I didn't like but overall, it was an overwhelming experience and it may hold the record for the only movie I was ever afraid of. The plot is so tortuous, one really needs to view it multiple times to completely get the gist of it and become immune to it. A detective named Scottie Ferguson with a paralyzing fear of heights quits the San Francisco police force and then is hired by an old college buddy to follow the latter's wife, who has been displaying strange psychological behavior. Scottie becomes increasingly and dangerously obsessed with the cool blonde and ends up being driven to the brink of insanity. There are several things I love about this movie since as of this writing, I've seen it a total of five times. First and foremost, the acting is top-notch but then again, Hitchcock did get a top-notch actor in the always lovable Jimmy Stewart-well, he's actually not quite that lovable in Vertigo. Gone are the days of his aw-shucks persona in It's a Wonderful Life, Mr. Smith Goes to Washington and Rear Window. Stewart's performance in Vertigo is so complex and convincing, it disturbs me a bit-and it's a heck of a performance. In the beginning, he still retains a little of his old likable mannerisms but as the films progresses, he becomes darker and more agitated so that by the climax, his anger boils over to the point of him yelling at Kim Novak's character and throughout, his eyes have a crazed and tortured shine that I've never seen in any other film of his-and I've seen over twenty films of his. He completely pulls off the role of a necrophiliac sufferer of Freud's Repetition Complex and his habit of following Kim Novak-and later leering at women who bear a resemblance to her- are more than borderline stalker. This is really the only one of Jimmy Stewart's characters I don't like and if he can make me not like him, then I really must have some great evidence to support my statement of him being the greatest actor ever. But let's not forget Kim Novak's performance. She plays dual roles-which is really tough to pull off- and does it flawlessly. Anyone else in her role just would not have worked. Novak adds a certain haunting and hypnotic quality to the character of Madeleine that adds to her mystery and elusiveness. Also, I love the photography in this film-it's probably some of the most beautiful photography I've ever seen in a film period. There is a dreamlike quality and the pastel tone of the colors reminds me of a watercolor painting. Heck, it's so beautiful, it makes me want to go to San Francisco. The music is brilliant as well and almost makes you see swirling patterns. I think that Hitchcock truly captured lightning in a bottle with this movie and that there will never be another film like it. If I had to say anything against it, it would be just a personal thing. The nightmare sequence will probably always creep me out no matter how many times I see the movie. This movie is brilliant.

However, towards the end of the film Roman has some kind of revelation. He totally admits his guilt at conning his brother-in-law out of 25k and dramatically tears up the cheque. Que the bear.The bear, whom we later find out is a female named Judy, shows up and terrorizes the entire cast of the film, minus Bucks love interest.So who is the bad guy? I say it's the Raccoons. During the entire film, they are the only ones whom we feel no sympathy for. They are truly evil.What's up with the talking Racoons?Despite what I just said about them, I think their roll in the film is comedy, and possibly an excuse to show cute and cuddly creatures that only cause havoc. The translations are a nice touch. It's a way to superimpose a human element to the great outdoors. They even have names. Nature, has become a character in the film, an actual face, and voice. A person whom we can see and understand.Lets not go crazy however, it's still a comedy. I think we should all take a spin cycle and think about it a little bit more. )Is it believable that Buck ditched his girl for a family dinner?No, it is not believable that Buck did that. Buck seems to have an extreme attachment to his family. If you were young and single, and a gorgeous human specimen saunters into your life. It seems only logical that you might excuse yourself from the table, and pursue happiness. Totally unbelievable that he didn't even attempt to leave. And where was dad?

What I find fascinating about this film is the fact its actually based on a real person and what he actually claimed. An 18th Century German nobleman who spoke or boasted of his outrageous adventures whilst at war against the Ottoman Empire. Whether of not this chap was possibly a bit tipsy at time I don't know but its quite amazing to think this man made himself into a bit of a legend through these tall tales.The films plot starts off in the present day of the film and then briefly as a short story told by Munchausen himself. It then leads back into the present day of the film again and carries on as an adventure, presumably the same adventures adapted from the Barons own stories. In short we follow the Baron and a little girl as he goes off to find his close friends so he can then return to this unnamed European city and save them from the attacking Turks.Surreal isn't the word...or maybe it is, as this film is right out there with Gilliam's other bizarre fantasy worlds. Of course the film is based on the novels that recount the tall tales of the real man in question so I'm guessing that what we see is actually the real Munchausen's imagination and Gilliam has just recreated it, with some artistic license I'm sure. What is accurate to the source material I can't say as I have not read the books.So the main plot point is for Munchausen to find his four compadres who are scattered around in this bizarre universe. We follow the Baron as he travels to the Moon of all places, to the South China sea, the belly of a huge sea monster (familiar story line for fairy tales) and deep below the Earth in the realm of the Roman God Vulcan. A heavily character driven movie with each little venture being hosted by new outlandish people. I think most viewers may have forget that Robin Williams was in this film as the headless King of the Moon...and oh my is he annoying, yep its that old Williams routine that makes you wanna slap him. I guess he suits the crazy character but it just feels like the Robin Williams show.Another performance that felt a little weird was Oliver Reed as the God Vulcan. I'm not entirely sure Reed even knows he's in a film here, he plays the character as an oafish quick tempered stereotypical British northerner, whilst also coming across like a simpleton and a bit drunk, so that's just an aging Reed then. A young Uma Thurman portrays his wife Venus which stuns you because she was actually pretty back then, doesn't say much though.There are so many characters in this film I couldn't possibly go through them all. Pryce is the perfect choice as the snivelling city official, Eric Idle and Jack Purvis take to this extreme fantasy like a duck to water with all their previous fantasy film\/Gilliam experience but its John Neville who steals the show as the Baron. For a start the makeup is brilliant and really captures those typical aristocratic features, they really nail the real life caricature of Munchausen. I also loved that old fashioned gentlemanly lordly performance by Neville, both dashing and flamboyant in his beautiful period attire, sword at his side, elegant facial hair and perfectly pompous wig. One could say a dignified pirate appearance. Its a bit odd how his age keeps changing from time to time depending on the specific escapade they are on but every time Neville looks terrific. It really is quite incredible how he actually resembles some real historic images from the era.The film can't help but look a bit dated these days I'm afraid, for its time the film was top of its game but these days the cracks show. Not to say that dampens your enjoyment of the film, if anything it heightens it and adds to the delightful charm of all you see. There is something about Gilliam films, that unique look that has carried through with other projects like 'Time Bandits' and 'Jabberwocky', its almost crappy looking, obvious effects yet somehow it just works. This film has it all with the added bonus of some lovely period costumes and that wonderful theatre set opening.I must admit the film doesn't quite hold up the wonder it used to have for me when I was but a mere sprog. The fantasy element is excellent and feels more like a traditional fairytale or dream more than anything, not so much like an Indy type adventure. I think some bits work and some don't, the whole Moon part feels a bit stupid in all honesty and I didn't like Reed's God, but getting swallowed by the sea monster is the quintessential time-honoured fantasy fodder that I liked. There are many golden classic images and sequences in this film that have stood the test of time. That along with Neville's grand performance and some sumptuous sets and costumes you can see why this film was nominated for so many awards.7.5\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"24 March 2014","score":"","review":" Gilliam must be the king of fantasy films, his filmography lists some true cults and this tale of tall stories is no exception.

I think some bits work and some don't, the whole Moon part feels a bit stupid in all honesty and I didn't like Reed's God, but getting swallowed by the sea monster is the quintessential time-honoured fantasy fodder that I liked. There are many golden classic images and sequences in this film that have stood the test of time.

What I find fascinating about this film is the fact its actually based on a real person and what he actually claimed. An 18th Century German nobleman who spoke or boasted of his outrageous adventures whilst at war against the Ottoman Empire. Whether of not this chap was possibly a bit tipsy at time I don't know but its quite amazing to think this man made himself into a bit of a legend through these tall tales.The films plot starts off in the present day of the film and then briefly as a short story told by Munchausen himself. It then leads back into the present day of the film again and carries on as an adventure, presumably the same adventures adapted from the Barons own stories. In short we follow the Baron and a little girl as he goes off to find his close friends so he can then return to this unnamed European city and save them from the attacking Turks.Surreal isn't the word...or maybe it is, as this film is right out there with Gilliam's other bizarre fantasy worlds. Of course the film is based on the novels that recount the tall tales of the real man in question so I'm guessing that what we see is actually the real Munchausen's imagination and Gilliam has just recreated it, with some artistic license I'm sure. What is accurate to the source material I can't say as I have not read the books.So the main plot point is for Munchausen to find his four compadres who are scattered around in this bizarre universe. We follow the Baron as he travels to the Moon of all places, to the South China sea, the belly of a huge sea monster (familiar story line for fairy tales) and deep below the Earth in the realm of the Roman God Vulcan. A heavily character driven movie with each little venture being hosted by new outlandish people. I think most viewers may have forget that Robin Williams was in this film as the headless King of the Moon...and oh my is he annoying, yep its that old Williams routine that makes you wanna slap him. I guess he suits the crazy character but it just feels like the Robin Williams show.Another performance that felt a little weird was Oliver Reed as the God Vulcan. I'm not entirely sure Reed even knows he's in a film here, he plays the character as an oafish quick tempered stereotypical British northerner, whilst also coming across like a simpleton and a bit drunk, so that's just an aging Reed then. A young Uma Thurman portrays his wife Venus which stuns you because she was actually pretty back then, doesn't say much though.There are so many characters in this film I couldn't possibly go through them all. Pryce is the perfect choice as the snivelling city official, Eric Idle and Jack Purvis take to this extreme fantasy like a duck to water with all their previous fantasy film\/Gilliam experience but its John Neville who steals the show as the Baron. For a start the makeup is brilliant and really captures those typical aristocratic features, they really nail the real life caricature of Munchausen. I also loved that old fashioned gentlemanly lordly performance by Neville, both dashing and flamboyant in his beautiful period attire, sword at his side, elegant facial hair and perfectly pompous wig. One could say a dignified pirate appearance. Its a bit odd how his age keeps changing from time to time depending on the specific escapade they are on but every time Neville looks terrific. It really is quite incredible how he actually resembles some real historic images from the era.The film can't help but look a bit dated these days I'm afraid, for its time the film was top of its game but these days the cracks show. Not to say that dampens your enjoyment of the film, if anything it heightens it and adds to the delightful charm of all you see. There is something about Gilliam films, that unique look that has carried through with other projects like 'Time Bandits' and 'Jabberwocky', its almost crappy looking, obvious effects yet somehow it just works. This film has it all with the added bonus of some lovely period costumes and that wonderful theatre set opening.I must admit the film doesn't quite hold up the wonder it used to have for me when I was but a mere sprog.

From incredible CG characters like Gollum to Keanu Reeves dodging bullets in slow motion, it would be easy to remake a much earlier film and throw every digital trick in the book at it, expecting success and critical acclaim. Of course, it doesn't always work like that as there are any number of things that can scupper a production from backstage fighting, studio disagreements and lead actors' egos clashing. And when you have all three then you get The Island Of Dr. Moreau, a film so mired in issues that it's a miracle it was released or even finished. What's really tragic is that it had a really promising opening and could have been so much better. Instead, it descends into an absolute farce of a film with very little to recommend.David Thewlis plays Edward Douglas, a survivor of a plane crash drifting alone and almost dead at sea. Picked up by a man named Montgomery (Val Kilmer) and slowly nursed back to health, Douglas is taken to a remote island and made a guest of reclusive scientist Doctor Moreau (Marlon Brando). But the island hides a multitude of Moreau subjects - inhuman creatures that are monitored and kept under Moreau's control through implanted pain receptors. As Douglas desperately tries to escape the island, one such creature (Daniel Rigney) discovers the doctor's secret implant and removes it. As the mutants begin to rise up against Moreau and the others, Douglas realises that he must fight for his life before all hope is lost.Believe me when I say that this film really does start off well - the film offers a tempting mystery behind the enigmatic Moreau's jungle paradise and everything looks suitably ramshackle and intriguing. Then Brando himself appears, lording it up and caked in weird snow-white make-up and it's at this point that the film tanks like the Exxon Valdez. It goes from a promising sci-fi mystery with a slight horror element to a drug-fuelled Twin Peaks tribute, populated with dwarfs and jobbing actors covered in excessive amounts of make-up, prosthetics and facial hair. The only exception is Fairuza Balk as the pretty cat-hybrid 'daughter' who is there solely to provide a possible love interest to Thewlis. The cast do what they can with a dodgy (and hastily rewritten) script but none can hold a candle to Kilmer who, like the film, goes utterly off the rails halfway through. It also forgets what the story has established already - for example, the primitive and feral beasts call guns the fire that kills but within half-an-hour, they've learnt the word for guns but also can drive jeeps and reload an AK47. With claws and hooves. Riiiiight.The Island Of Dr. Moreau will probably ensure that this particular H.G. Wells tale won't be remade for quite some time. It isn't a long film but it feels like it, especially once the madness begins and Kilmer's character acts like a junkie mid-relapse. The only real aspect of the production I can applaud is the creature effects which are convincing enough, to a point. Certainly, they made me wonder whether Brando was wearing prosthetics as he looks grossly overweight and acts like a mere shadow of his previous self. I know that sounds harsh but his performance is not his finest hour, one of many that people had during this movie. But this is undoubtedly the Val Kilmer show and frankly, I'd like to know exactly what he was on at the time. As I understand, hardly anybody had a good time on set but never before has that despondency appeared on screen so spectacularly than it did here. The Island Of Dr. Moreau is the worse kind of movie, the sort that builds up your hopes and then knocks them back like that glamorous woman out of your league at the bar. It's more disappointing than it is bad, throwing away its promising potential and settling with being a stupid and moronic action blast.

Who wants to go through what they are up against?)It succeeds in keeping it firm and concrete and never tries to take the easy way out. At the same time it doesn't overwhelm its viewers with becoming preachy or moralistic. The scruples are already there for you and though this movie is a heavy hitter, the viewers feel the metaphoric concrete weight as much as the characters depicted here.Another standout trait Return to Paradise offers is that it focuses on are the numerous culture clashing while avoiding any signs of showing and anachronistic traits (like in Midnight Express or The Deer Hunter among others). It actually succeeds in balancing the story by remaining judicious in every way possible. Sure we have faced many troubled situations where you are caught in an inescapable trap and you cannot get out of it, the film is not very plot oriented, but more leaning towards a debate faced solely on ethics.The acting is very provocative as each character yearns for our sympathy. Joaquin Phoenix shines very nicely as the misfortunate victim who has the most weight placed on him who is also fading out from the exhaustion that was inflicted on him. Anne Heche is wonderful as the attorney who knows her situation is dire and makes the most of time trying to cope with the complicated situation she's facing in this case. The real scene stealer is Vince Vaughn as Sheriff and his change from a careless person to a more responsible person is all very real. The characters are all very real people.By the end of the movie, the humanity materializes before our very eyes as Sheriff goes through great lengths by helping out his fallen buddy Lewis (Phoenix), which would expunge all of his other past mistakes and by his helping out his buddy, we see the moral strength Sheriff has deep inside of him.Return to Paradise stands the test of time as a brilliant movie in all of its hardships and complexities. As a suggestion if you should see another movie, make it lighter movie so that you won't get sadder through every movie you see.

What's worse, Harrison Ford, as Van den broeck, appears to be in this somnambulistic state throughout the entire movie. Perhaps the best display of this torpor that Ford walks around in is when he is identifying the body of his wife, for legal purposes, after the crash. Ford shows almost no response, and I, therefore, thought that it was not his wife.Kristen Scott Thomas (as Kay Chandler) exhibits so little emotion that (I think inadvertently), some would wonder if she was behind her husband's death. At her first public appearance after that death (at a political fundraiser), she says Thank you all for your friendship and support and don't leave without letting me talk to each one of you. Very shallow, false, almost like cardboard.Not only is Van den broeck's demeanor stupid (as in a stupor), he actually acts creepy. The first time he visits Chandler, to talk about what he assumes is a tryst between their former spouses, he acts so troubled, psychologically, that when Chandler's 15 year old daughter comes home, and is at the door, if I were she, I would have run with her out the door and called the police (one of which, Van Den Broeck is one).I could have forgiven all of this (some people just don't easily, or ever, display emotion), and given this movie a 7, which to me is a grading of not great, but OK, but I downgraded it to a 6, because of the impertinent scenes regarding Van Den Broeck's investigation of another cop. Note to screenwriter Kurt Luedtke If you are going to write disparate scenes, make two different movies. In summary, it is torture to watch Harrison Ford mumble and amble his way through a performance that could have been either electrifying or heart-rendering.

Seen that one before, huh? Just wait. From that, they went on and created the most plot-driven, intricately pieced movie in the last 25 years. The result the Usual Suspects, one hell of a movie that redefines the word plot twist.The story is convoluted, and is really confusing to read, although easy to follow on screen. Special investigator Kujan (Chazz Palminteri) grills Verbal Kint (Kevin Spacey), a crippled con- man who is the lone survivor of an LA boat explosion that claimed more than 20 victims. Kujan wants to confirm that his nemesis, the rogue cop Keaton (Gabriel Byrne), is actually dead. Kint relates the majority of the film in flashback, beginning with the fateful day when five shifty guys meet in a police-station lineup in New York City. What follows is a shell-game of violence and betrayal, all hinging on the identity of a mysterious villain called Keyser Soze.The film is brilliantly compact it's the shortest 105 minutes you'll ever spend watching a movie. The cast is exceptional. Palminteri shines, he is brutally honest, a true cop, one who is going after the whole story because its there. Stephen Baldwin, Benicio Del Toro, Gabriel Byrne, and Kevin Pollak are all exceptional as the other suspects that are tagged along within the story that is told by Verbal.However, this will be forever known as the film that launched Kevin Spacey. Spacey is simply breathtaking, he is a force on screen, giving a magnetic performance that jars the senses at the end of this twisting maze. Spacey's performance will be remembered for years, for it is the best of his career. Verbal Kint is a clever storyteller, weak, oppressed, and gleefully evil to the bone, yet pitiful, one who draws sympathy. What this film boils down to is one of the greatest twists in cinematic history. I won't dare spoil it, but let me be assured that you will be amazed. Kudos to McQuarrie and Singer for giving the audience a delightful, fast-paced, furiously plot- driven movie with quirky characters, phenomenal acting, and some hilarious moments that lead up to a climactic and shocking twist. I highly recommend it.

Nevertheless, North By Northwest, the 1959 suspense\/adventure\/thriller\/romance\/mystery starring Cary Grant and Eva Marie Saint is still very worthy of the high acclamation it receives. It could very comfortably fit into any one of the five genres just listed and it is an incredibly fun movie to watch. Ordinary New York businessman Roger Thornhill (Cary Grant) is abducted and taken to a private mansion where enemy spies plotting against the U.S. government accuse him of being an American spy named George Kaplan. He repeatedly insists that he is not George Kaplan and after escaping, ends up running for his life through various states while being pursued by both the enemy spies and the police, who have framed him for murder. I will not reveal the rest of the plot as it would take me way too long to remember all the twists and turns. North By Northwest has some memorable scenes. The most famous one depicts Thornhill being chased by a crop duster plane. Also, the climax is pretty suspenseful as well. But I think what I love most about this movie is the way it has aged. It's fifty-five years old yet I still feel it could have been released last Friday and still have done as well financially as it did back in 1959. I guess if I had to say one thing against this film, it would be during the climb down Mt. Rushmore. Seriously, do you really think a man and woman could scale and climb down the steep sides of Mount Rushmore with any success while wearing dress shoes and high heels?
