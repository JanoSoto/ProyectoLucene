What a mysterious and almost spooky film. I loved how the music went with the pace of each step of Philip's feet. It gave me the chills for some reason...One of the greatest aspects of this film is that you get to see Bette Davis coming into herself right before your eyes. She's great, not necessarily because this is her best work, but because it was so out of the ordinary to be so vicious, gritty, and unflinching as an actress in 1934... Bette was a risk taker, always wanting to be different and this is right about when she started to realize that she could be as nasty and daring as she wanted and people would love her for it. If you're a true lover of film, it's amazing to see...She just had a way of delivering a line that made the part, and the film for that matter, belong to her. Like A mass of music and fire. That's me...an old kazoo and some sparklers or But you are Blanche, you are in that chair! or WITH ALL MY HEART, I STILL LOVE THE MAN I KILLED!!... Those are from a few of her films, but you get my drift. She was just so brave, sassy, and exotic looking with those beautiful big eyes. After seeing this, I can't believe it was remade twice...Leslie Howard was gorgeous...so calm and persistent, needing to be loved. I thought he was adorable and couldn't understand how everyone wasn't falling for him, but then again, everyone was...except Mildred. He did a great job...The only thing that I didn't like was something that was common with the writing in the early films. They'd make a character so hateful that it's almost unbelievable that someone would actually fall for them in the first place. The performances were great, but in real life, Philip would have never been interested in Mildred. That's just the simple truth... See it!!

One sees it and can't help but start humming that oh so familiar tune. Heck, forget humming, maybe you just want to burst out singing. And therein lies the magic of The Wizard of Oz, undoubtedly, and deservedly, one of the most beloved films of all time. Magical, and downright revolutionary in many ways, when it first premiered in 1939, The Wizard of Oz stands the test of time, forever a treat for all ages. What does this film have going for it? Start with a brilliantly conceived, and executed, story. Add in some of the most memorable acting performances of all time. Toss in what for the time was startlingly brilliant color and dazzling cinematography. Don't forget the wonderful special effects, which may seem mundane by modern standards, but which were simply amazing for their time. And oh, have I mentioned the songs? You'll be humming, or singing, for weeks after watching this one. We're Off To See The Wizard, Ding Dong! The Witch Is Dead!, If I Only Had A Brain\/Heart\/Nerve, Merry Old Land Of Oz, It Really Was No Miracle...each a toe-tapping, stick in your brain and refuse to leave treasure. And of course there is what would become Judy Garland's signature song, the incredibly poignant Over The Rainbow, perfect in every way for the character of farm girl Dorothy in this film and made all the more poignant knowing the troubles which lay ahead for Garland in the years following the making of The Wizard of Oz.Who doesn't know by now the story of The Wizard of Oz? The film takes a little while to get moving in sepia-toned Kansas but those opening scenes are critical in introducing us to some very important people we'll encounter again in different guises later on. Once a twister picks up Dorothy's house and transports her and her dog, Toto, to Oz the real fun begins. When Dorothy opens the sepia-toned door of her house all of a sudden the screen is bursting with the most brilliant color you will ever see. The transition from dreary Kansas to magical Oz is simply breathtaking. And now the real fun begins. After spending some time with the tiny inhabitants of Munchkinland, and encountering witches both good and wicked, Dorothy follows the yellow brick road to the Emerald City where she hopes to meet the Wizard of Oz who may be the only one who can help her return home to Kansas. That journey along the yellow brick road may well be the most magical in film history.While Judy Garland in the role of Dorothy is the unquestioned star of the film The Wizard of Oz is graced with universally brilliant performances from a wonderfully diverse and talented cast of characters. Most notable are Dorothy's companions along the yellow brick road, The Scarecrow, The Tin Man and The Cowardly Lion, played by Ray Bolger, Jack Haley and Bert Lahr respectively. Even hidden behind layers of makeup, these three actors still manage to give their characters tremendous personality, something so critical in allowing the audience to identify with the characters they portrayed. Garland is undeniably brilliant but The Wizard of Oz just would not be the same without the extraordinary, and often overshadowed, talents of Bolger, Haley and Lahr. Special recognition to Bolger, the perfect scarecrow, who twists and turns and contorts himself in such a manner it's hard to believe he has a bone in his body.Billie Burke as Glinda the Good Witch, Margaret Hamilton as Dorothy's adversary, The Wicked Witch, and Frank Morgan in a number of memorable roles also have key parts to play and they are each terrific as well. And of course there are the multitude of Munchkins who provide a truly surreal beginning to Dorothy's magical journey. There's really not much to quibble with here, everything is almost pitch-perfect. Perhaps the opening scenes in Kansas could move a little quicker and maybe the stay in Munchkinland could be a little briefer, as the tiny Munchkins' cute factor begins to wane just a touch. But once Dorothy sets off on that yellow brick road The Wizard of Oz is undeniably one of the most magical movie experiences ever seen. A classic in its time and a classic for all time.

One sees it and can't help but start humming that oh so familiar tune. Heck, forget humming, maybe you just want to burst out singing. And therein lies the magic of The Wizard of Oz, undoubtedly, and deservedly, one of the most beloved films of all time. Magical, and downright revolutionary in many ways, when it first premiered in 1939, The Wizard of Oz stands the test of time, forever a treat for all ages. What does this film have going for it? Start with a brilliantly conceived, and executed, story. Add in some of the most memorable acting performances of all time. Toss in what for the time was startlingly brilliant color and dazzling cinematography. Don't forget the wonderful special effects, which may seem mundane by modern standards, but which were simply amazing for their time. And oh, have I mentioned the songs? You'll be humming, or singing, for weeks after watching this one. We're Off To See The Wizard, Ding Dong! The Witch Is Dead!, If I Only Had A Brain\/Heart\/Nerve, Merry Old Land Of Oz, It Really Was No Miracle...each a toe-tapping, stick in your brain and refuse to leave treasure. And of course there is what would become Judy Garland's signature song, the incredibly poignant Over The Rainbow, perfect in every way for the character of farm girl Dorothy in this film and made all the more poignant knowing the troubles which lay ahead for Garland in the years following the making of The Wizard of Oz.Who doesn't know by now the story of The Wizard of Oz? The film takes a little while to get moving in sepia-toned Kansas but those opening scenes are critical in introducing us to some very important people we'll encounter again in different guises later on. Once a twister picks up Dorothy's house and transports her and her dog, Toto, to Oz the real fun begins. When Dorothy opens the sepia-toned door of her house all of a sudden the screen is bursting with the most brilliant color you will ever see. The transition from dreary Kansas to magical Oz is simply breathtaking. And now the real fun begins. After spending some time with the tiny inhabitants of Munchkinland, and encountering witches both good and wicked, Dorothy follows the yellow brick road to the Emerald City where she hopes to meet the Wizard of Oz who may be the only one who can help her return home to Kansas. That journey along the yellow brick road may well be the most magical in film history.While Judy Garland in the role of Dorothy is the unquestioned star of the film The Wizard of Oz is graced with universally brilliant performances from a wonderfully diverse and talented cast of characters. Most notable are Dorothy's companions along the yellow brick road, The Scarecrow, The Tin Man and The Cowardly Lion, played by Ray Bolger, Jack Haley and Bert Lahr respectively. Even hidden behind layers of makeup, these three actors still manage to give their characters tremendous personality, something so critical in allowing the audience to identify with the characters they portrayed. Garland is undeniably brilliant but The Wizard of Oz just would not be the same without the extraordinary, and often overshadowed, talents of Bolger, Haley and Lahr. Special recognition to Bolger, the perfect scarecrow, who twists and turns and contorts himself in such a manner it's hard to believe he has a bone in his body.Billie Burke as Glinda the Good Witch, Margaret Hamilton as Dorothy's adversary, The Wicked Witch, and Frank Morgan in a number of memorable roles also have key parts to play and they are each terrific as well. And of course there are the multitude of Munchkins who provide a truly surreal beginning to Dorothy's magical journey. There's really not much to quibble with here, everything is almost pitch-perfect. Perhaps the opening scenes in Kansas could move a little quicker and maybe the stay in Munchkinland could be a little briefer, as the tiny Munchkins' cute factor begins to wane just a touch. But once Dorothy sets off on that yellow brick road The Wizard of Oz is undeniably one of the most magical movie experiences ever seen. A classic in its time and a classic for all time.

The story itself is fairly light, but remains the creepiest of the lot. Given, it's actors are mostly horrible, Ben being the noticeable exception, and one of the reasons the movie is so watchable... Also, due to it having such an ambiguous premise, many still wonder how and why the dead came to rise and feast upon the living - it poses many questions...

Sure, as the budgets have increased, and the technology has, it's been easier to create better movies... BUT, more than thirty years on, and this movie is still standing head and shoulders above most. I put it down to Johnny (They're coming to get you Barbara!) and the zombie from the cemetery - that guy is particularly creepy.I'm showing this to my kids on their fifth birthday. It's a good movie to use to keep them in line until they're ready to be kicked out of home - just threaten them with it - if they decide to wander the streets at night or disobey you, zombies might eat them or turn their car over and chase them for miles...10 out of 10. A classic. Get it, watch it, love it. If you don't, too bad. *** NOTE *** Don't watch the 25th anniversary edition, however, as it ruins the musical score and adds unnecessary and stupid scenes, and a dumb ending that ruins the movie. If it were watched with that version, I'd change the score to about 2\/10. It really cheapens it, tries plot development and fails, and should be avoided like the plague. CHEERS!

I would even assert that this isn't a children's film at all, but a film aimed at adults under the guise of a kids' film. And that type of subversion is exactly what you'd expect from Mary Poppins. Her method from day one is to use reverse psychology on anyone she is trying to manipulate--in a good sense, of course. She teaches the children to give money to the poor by suggesting they feed the birds. She gets them to fall asleep by sweetly singing Stay Awake. She gets Mr. Banks to take the kids with him to work by acting as if it was his idea, and complimenting him for thinking of it. (A spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down.)The film's main character, dramatically speaking, is not Mary, nor the children. It is the father, George Banks.

The event that inspired Keaton has been named The Great Locomotive Chase, as it had volunteers from the Union Army taking command over a train, planning to do damage on the Western and Atlantic railroad. Predictably, Keaton's version also provides a love story, but first and foremost in order to give our hero a personal reason to expose himself to so much danger in the first place. Johnnie Gray, as Keaton is named in the film, does not prove to be particularly informed as to what this big war is about, being mostly concerned about his sweetheart Annabelle who is kidnapped, as well as his own train THE GENERAL. Commentators suspecting Keaton for having had political motivations when he chose to present himself as a Southerner in this film, do themselves a disservice; much like Charlie Chaplin and unlike Harold Lloyd, Keaton refused to let his character ever truly win a battle, even when the last frame seemed to have him relatively happy.Whichever side in the war Keaton's character supported, one can still sympathize with his personal situation as he desperately tries to rescue the girl and the train that matter so much to him in his life. Just as in his other great films but here with an unusually grandiose setting to showcase it, he survives every struggle just barely by adapting his characteristically mechanical handling of all objects that come in his way, rarely expressing any large degree of emotional involvement in the catastrophes that haunt him. The result is not only one of the greatest comedies of the silent era, but truly an outstanding achievement that transcends genres and eras. Being more character-driven than other Keaton-films such as THE NAVIGATOR and COLLEGE, and even more so his two-reelers, THE GENERAL may demand a bit more to tone into, which may explain why its contemporary critics were largely indifferent. To viewers anticipating the characteristic fast-paced prat-falls of Buster, this film may come off as a slight surprise, as the humor is more subtle, the scale of the gags increasing bit by bit throughout, until the incredible climax that turned out to become, reportedly, the most expensive shot of film in the entire silent era. Keaton, on his part, is given more opportunity to showcase his skills as an actor, which are easy to overlook in other, less character-driven films (though still very apparent to the acquainted).Due to its large costs (and possibly lukewarm reviews...) THE GENERAL was by and large considered a flop. It was nowhere as much immortalized in the minds of the public as Chaplin's THE GOLD RUSH or Lloyd's SAFETY LAST.

Let me start by saying that the movie is not worth watching unless you see the IMAGE DVD version. Any other version is missing half of the movie and has bad image quality and incorrect tints. For those of you who are unfamiliar with movies from the 20's, this is a silent film which means there is a musical track playing throughout the film to match what is going on and in some cases sound effects. As far as tints go, unless everything was done in studio where the lighting and other effects could be controlled, the technology at the time only allowed for filming during the day so different tints were used so show that it was daytime\/nighttime, indoors\/outdoors, and other events. Since the actors did not have dialog in silent films, they had to over act a bit to show you what is happening. Inter-titles(written speech\/narration) cuts in and out of the film. Let it be known that this means that you have to pay very close attention to a silent film to fully enjoy and understand it.The movie was made in 1925 and runs 93 minutes.

For those of you who are unfamiliar with movies from the 20's, this is a silent film which means there is a musical track playing throughout the film to match what is going on and in some cases sound effects. As far as tints go, unless everything was done in studio where the lighting and other effects could be controlled, the technology at the time only allowed for filming during the day so different tints were used so show that it was daytime\/nighttime, indoors\/outdoors, and other events. Since the actors did not have dialog in silent films, they had to over act a bit to show you what is happening. Inter-titles(written speech\/narration) cuts in and out of the film.

That doesn't stop me watching it repeatedly, however, since it's also one of the most unintentionally hilarious movies ever made, right up there with Showgirls, although this turkey makes Showgirls seem positively knowing by comparison.What's wrong with it? So much, and some of the problems run right to the core. And at that core is Patrick Swayze grinning and working out whilst trying to read an upside-down copy of Sun Tzu's Art of War.Let's examine the script, which is appalling. Every Swayze retort or one-liner is brainless, and yet people react as if he's some kind of invincible cross between the Hulk and Tennyson. As an example, Swayze is giving a speech whereby he asks his charges to Just be nice to the punters in all cases, no matter how vile they are. One of the bouncers asks What if someone calls my mother a whore? to which Swayze quips Is she?. Well, that certainly put him in his place, and the poor thug is left speechless.Along with his incredible wit, Swayze (make no mistake, he's not playing a character here) is also incredibly muscular. No opportunity to show off his 'guns' goes by without him whipping off his shirt, flexing, and looking philosophical, preferably whilst stitching up a knife wound one handed. One of the funniest scenes of all involves a young barmaid coming to visit Swayze out at his (ludicrously good) farm-loft apartment (which is also, coincidentally, just the other side of the river from the villain's hideout). She is fortunate enough to catch sight of Swayze's wet, muscular backside as he climbs out of the tub. We are treated to a close-up of her reaction, and one would think she'd just had an orgasm and won the lottery.More ridiculous than any of Swayze's posturing is the plot. How Ben Gazzara, the local super-villain, has managed to grow rich off this one-horse town is a mystery. He's almost certainly the number one employer so long as you're looking to move into thuggery, so vast is his army of morons.Later in the film, the hairy-lipped Sam Elliot enters as his typical slow-talking cowboy\/wise-man stereotype. It's here that Swayze's ego actually takes a back seat and we witness him in awe of one of his peers. For some reason, Elliot is the real King of the Coolers, although the question of why a skinny old man should be better than Swayze is never answered. Frankly, who cares. Elliot still reminds me of Jerry Mouse's guitar-playing, whisker-grabbing Uncle.But the absolute high point of this film comes right at the end. As if you haven't been entertained enough, check out the speedo wearing Swayze's full-length flying dive into the river to swim with his new girlfriend. It has to be seen to be believed, and the young lady herself seems utterly perplexed at her situation - in that moment she realises she's dating not a man, but a two year old in a wrestler's body with a salami for a brain.This film is a testament to the truly mind-boggling ego of it's star, and the lack of talent of the writer and director. The writer has also written for Bronson and Seagal, and the director has managed only a couple more movies after this monstrosity, and his name is Rowdy.

My answer is that there is at least something in most movies that demands such action be taken. Here is an example of a movie that has never lost its luster for me. From the first time I saw it, I recognized its potential, the beauty of its craftsmanship, and its many virtues. There were so many thoughts and emotions going through me, as I laughed along with an involved audience at its clever, romantic, insightful, and moving screenplay. There was a movie that wasn't afraid to share its emotions with the audience in a way that Annie Hall didn't. It had a brain, a heart, and so much more.Part of the reason the movie succeeds so well is its incredibly talented cast Atkinson (in a short and hilarious role), McDowell who has never looked more charming, Hugh Grant, a funny lead who carried the film in a way Cary Grant would have been proud of. The very lovely and ethereal Kristen Thomas made also quite an impression. Mike Newell's direction and Richard Curtis' collaboration\/screenplay imbues everything and everybody with a magic and delicate touch that remains constant and very effective throughout the entire project.As most people know by now, the film follows the romantic adventures and mishaps of a bachelor who finally finds the woman of his dreams; only to discover she might be beyond his reach. They continue to see each other through a few weddings and ultimately realize they might just be perfect for each other. What makes their relationship a joy to watch is how well defined their characters are. They are real people with flaws, hopes, broken hearts, mistrust, envy, illusions, and dreams. The film entertains and yet it never takes the easy way out to solve their dilemmas. There are bits when one wonders why one is not repelled by some of their actions, then the audience realizes that they are reflections of themselves.There is much to commando in the film, from its romantic score, the gorgeous photography, the superb acting, and most importantly, the assured hand by Mike Newell who adds another gold star to his repertoire.

Most of them are pretty bad and Pitch Black, which is utterly unoriginal, could easily have been, too. Instead it's a cool, character-driven yet action-packed, dark thriller. An interplanetary space transport crashes on a desert planet with 3 suns and apparently perpetual daylight. Like Alien, the film begins by exploring the handful of survivors. Like Lifeboat, it gradually divulges that some of them have things to hide. Not Riddick (Diesel), an escaped murderer being returned to prison by bounty hunter Johns (Hauser, effectively icy & sleazy). When perpetual day suddenly turns to perpetual night, the creepy-crawlies come out to kill, rend & chow down on Fresh Human. To survive, the others must accept Riddick, who is tougher than all of them and has had a prison shine job on his eyes that lets him see in the dark. But Riddick must also overcome the hatred he has for all of his own kind, a rage that he covers under a cool, wry facade of independence. Will Riddick eventually sacrifice the others to ensure his own survival, or maybe even just for one universal up-yours to the human race? Diesel has a star-making role, making a repugnant character sympathetic, giving us fleeting glimpses of Riddick's sadness & loneliness while never, ever detracting from his granite-souled strength. Several other actors have more work to do in this film than most action flicks, but they are all up to the task. The guilt-ridden pilot Fry (Mitchell), a dark, refreshing break from the butt-kicking babe stereotype begun with Charlie's Angels, holds the others together while Riddick comes & goes. Mitchell has a steeliness & style that belies her blonde cuteness and holds up well opposite both the brawny, in-your-face Diesel & the taut, cool Hauser. David, as a Muslim space pilgrim, brings religious faith (Because you do not believe in God, does not mean God does not believe in you) to counter the others' anger, despair or wry selfishness (Look to thine own ass first). The dark, percussion-heavy score is perfect for Pitch Black's visual effects, which are somewhat less spectacular than recent Star Wars but more effective, a background rather than a replacement for the action. Pitch Black is as entertaining as any old Saturday matinée, much better suited to our know-it-all times, without the condescension & stereotyping to which Hollywood is usually so devoted.

Most of them are pretty bad and Pitch Black, which is utterly unoriginal, could easily have been, too. Instead it's a cool, character-driven yet action-packed, dark thriller. An interplanetary space transport crashes on a desert planet with 3 suns and apparently perpetual daylight. Like Alien, the film begins by exploring the handful of survivors. Like Lifeboat, it gradually divulges that some of them have things to hide. Not Riddick (Diesel), an escaped murderer being returned to prison by bounty hunter Johns (Hauser, effectively icy & sleazy). When perpetual day suddenly turns to perpetual night, the creepy-crawlies come out to kill, rend & chow down on Fresh Human. To survive, the others must accept Riddick, who is tougher than all of them and has had a prison shine job on his eyes that lets him see in the dark. But Riddick must also overcome the hatred he has for all of his own kind, a rage that he covers under a cool, wry facade of independence. Will Riddick eventually sacrifice the others to ensure his own survival, or maybe even just for one universal up-yours to the human race? Diesel has a star-making role, making a repugnant character sympathetic, giving us fleeting glimpses of Riddick's sadness & loneliness while never, ever detracting from his granite-souled strength. Several other actors have more work to do in this film than most action flicks, but they are all up to the task. The guilt-ridden pilot Fry (Mitchell), a dark, refreshing break from the butt-kicking babe stereotype begun with Charlie's Angels, holds the others together while Riddick comes & goes. Mitchell has a steeliness & style that belies her blonde cuteness and holds up well opposite both the brawny, in-your-face Diesel & the taut, cool Hauser. David, as a Muslim space pilgrim, brings religious faith (Because you do not believe in God, does not mean God does not believe in you) to counter the others' anger, despair or wry selfishness (Look to thine own ass first). The dark, percussion-heavy score is perfect for Pitch Black's visual effects, which are somewhat less spectacular than recent Star Wars but more effective, a background rather than a replacement for the action. Pitch Black is as entertaining as any old Saturday matinée, much better suited to our know-it-all times, without the condescension & stereotyping to which Hollywood is usually so devoted.

This film helped to define the Troma formula that crap addicts the world over would grow to love - gory violence, gratuitous nudity and black humour, all mixed with a large dose of irony and an incredible lack of taste.Class of Nuke 'Em High was released just after The Toxic Avenger and it shares a similar nuclear theme. In this case, a nuclear waste facility is leaking toxic goo into the local high school with some rather unfortunate consequences for the student body. Unlike the poor nerd in the film's brilliant opening sequence, our heroes are not directly exposed to the toxic waste. Rather, Warren and Chrissy smoke marijuana grown on the grounds of the nuclear power plant. This ultra-potent pot not only makes Chrissy incredibly horny, but mutates her unborn child and imbues Warren with super-human strength.The film then focuses on Warren's rivalry with the Cretins (former honours students who have turned into freaks after smoking one too many toxic joints) and Chrissy's rampaging miscarried foetus (which lives in the toilet and hides out in a vat of toxic waste). These situations provide the filmmakers with plenty of opportunities for hilarious sight gags, gory violence and camp action - and they deliver.As with much of Troma's early output, this film has been crafted with considerable care and attention to detail, despite budgetary restrictions. The plot has its own ludicrous sense of logic and the direction is captivating - Kaufman, Herz and Richard W. Haines all share a directorial credit but the action sequences reek of Kaufman's mercurial style. I love the scene where Warren literally punches one of the cretins through the mouth, down into his chest. The special effects also deserve a mention. The creature effects used for Chrissy's mutant foetus are hilarious.The Class of Nuke 'Em High does not quite match The Toxic Avenger for originality or style, but it is a great example of what Troma does better than any other studio and why they are still around 20 years later.

Really the villain is quite wonderful, especially when he runs over all those people with his car while going on a joyride! The survival nut also has a classic line I gotta PROTECT myself! This movie is totally cheesy, but AWESOME, if you are into fantasy adventure and stuff like that. I just watched the 10th anniversary director's cut and I'm not sure how much the extra footage really adds to the story. At times it feels like a made-for-TV movie. But back to the villain. The Kurgan is the BEST. He is totally fun and full of life, evil, etc. He will make you shiver as he taunts the nuns in the church. It is TRULY a shame that they made any sequels to this movie. I HAVE NOT WATCHED ANY OF THEM SEQUELS and probably neither should you. Again, back to the villain the skull helmet he wears in the first fight scene is incredible looking. How'd they get the horse to kick like that? The establishing shot at sunset before MacCleod's death scene, set to bagpipe music, though a quick little snippet, is also quite good shot, and beautiful. Lots of little subtle things in this film to enjoy, despite the fact that it's basically just a low-brow entertainment fantasy flick. The opening wrestling sequence with the crane shot is particularly intense. Also nice to show the wrestlers, a great counterpoint to the quest of the immortals, the humans jabbering away like monkeys, wearing confederate flags, bashing each other with their drunken fists, etc. While in the background, unbeknownst to all the ignorant apes (us humans), the true struggle goes on...
