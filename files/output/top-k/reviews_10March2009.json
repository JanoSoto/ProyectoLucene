But Akira Kurosawa, rather, directed this universal tale made all the way across the world, set a thousand years ago, made 60 years ago, which has actually given root to philosophical movements and fields, transfiguring the account of a foul rape and murder into a contemplation on certainty and human nature. The film is about the real animal showing through the most coercive social doctrines.Beginning with a very powerful opening master shot of the Rashomon gate, two mingling time filaments construct the contemplation Under the Rashomon gate, time lingers ponderously, breathless, exhausted, gathering dust. In the forest time is imbued with heat and disquiet, with life and respect in peril of being erased. As is widely known about the film, the stories of the rape and murder are jointly conflicting. The plot unfolds in flashback as the bandit Toshirō Mifune, the murdered samurai Masayuki Mori, his wife Machiko Kyō, and the nameless woodcutter Takashi Shimura recount the events of the inscrutable afternoon. But it is also a flashback within a flashback. Kurosawa first transgresses across the lapse between these two strands with a glaring two minutes of unadorned cinema which aggregates both the woodcutter's walk into the forest, a succession of shots of constant sundry motion while the story bides its time in remission. So this scene, like those at the Rashomon gate, is chronological inertia, although its vibrancy and dormant violence, generated by its motion's rise and fall in pulse, introduces us to matters in the wood clearing. For the woodcutter's advance into the marrow of the forest, with its essentially anesthetic drift of movement per sudden cuts and camera maneuver, becomes our advance into the marrow of the film. When he stops, we are there and the forest has emerged as the focal mise en scene of the drama. However the camera proceeds to move very sparingly.The three men in the rain at the gate, comprised of Shimura's woodcutter, a traveling priest claims that he saw the samurai and the woman the same day the murder happened, and an earthy commoner, are like a Greek chorus remarking upon the turmoil in that open space. Their annotations, which throughout the film are chiefly of doubt and amazement, as the three parties in the crime each tell an extensively differing story of the death. Surprisingly, each maintains responsibility for the killing. Each telling retains the teller's honorable sense of self. Then the woodcutter gives a fourth take.Disposed to all this, some viewers consider Rashomon to be a conundrum for unriddling, upholding that there must be one correct account of the killing which we can unravel if we interpret the niceties discerningly enough. For others, Rashomon is the prototypical cinematic delineation of the philosophy that conceptions of truth and moral values are not absolute but relative, that truth is impenetrable. Indeed, we're given clues to believe each of the characters' versions of the story. There is no truth, just biased conception of events. Human beings don't tend to be capable of being candid with themselves regarding themselves. The average human cannot talk about him or herself without ornament to protect their ego. This script depicts such people, the temperament who cannot persevere without distortion to make them feel they're better people than they actually are to any objective opinion of their own. How many hypocrites do you really know? You already know you're one yourself. So am I. As animals, we're impetuous. We all have different externalizations of such behavior. What we must do to realize our significance is gain control over this characteristic.Fumio Hayasaka's slow, skin-and-bone score for Rashomon is infectious even as it's ever so subtle. This theme music is used as an exposition, associated with the presence of particular characters, and distinguishes between the inflection of tone from scene to scene. And each scene is in a class of its own. The swordfight in the bandit's recollection and the later version of the same swordfight are simply antithetical creatures. Mifune's version is a telling of rage, empowerment and humiliating the other guy. Swords clash, there are occasionally bare- knuckled struggles to reclaim a weapon, and Mifune laughing like a maniac. Later, we see even still not truly a swordfight but a fight that begins with swords in the hands of their frightened owners, who may for all we know have never before found themselves in such a fight, which devolves into a tightly aggressive mortal scuffle. Both are two of my favorite swordfights on film, no special effects are even needed! As for the scene where the husband's spectre tells the story, what other way in 11th century Japan would a court have believed they could gather all possible testimony when every survivor's account is drastically different?Kurosawa had to extemporize with sparse assets to bring it to the screen, but if anything, clenching the money clip perhaps resulted in a better film. Minimalism is indispensable to a story that depends on fine points and particulars, and the deficiency of excesses defines the discretion Kurosawa used and the rigor with which he had to work. In one sequence, there is a series of single close-ups of the bandit, then the wife, and then the husband, which then repeats to emphasize the triangular relationship. Kurosawa also peculiarly uses sunlight to actually symbolize evil and sin.Beside his remarkable instinct for what audiences wanted, there is a continuous trial-and-error strand throughout Kurosawa's work. The sense of freedom this film brought to young filmmakers was less a reaction to a mysterious thematic motif than to Kurosawa's scorn of the entrenched protocol of narrative cinema. He disregards the 180-degree rule, in so doing inverting relationships that have any extension in space, connects long shots and close-ups and shots of contradictory movements.

He'd left the country for money and fortune, and this is the end of it which never was. No, no, I'm not saying this was what Chaplin wanted to say with the film, because I don't think it is. But it's hard to not think in such terms when presented to Calvero, the sad, reflected, cheerful and extremely talented clown; the latter is particularly evident after he's had a drink. The clown is now washed-up and can't get work anywhere. Then one day he saves a young ballerina from committing suicide, and as he helps her along, eventually he comes to experience one final triumph in the limelight himself. Chaplin captures me completely in his obviously heartfelt role as Calvero, and the rest of the cast is excellent, including Claire Bloom as Terry, Chaplin's son Sydney as the young musician, Stapleton Kent's somewhat humorous portrayal of manager Claudius, and of course, The Other Biggest Big of The Silent Clowns, Buster Keaton; a special mention goes to Marjorie Bennett as Mrs. Alsop.Not only did Chaplin as always write and direct this film, he also composed the beautiful ballet to which Claire Bloom dances hypnotizingly. I am not much into ballet, but can't help the effect this one has on me, just as with the entire film. As Chaplin would say, words seem so futile, and indeed they do as I try to cover what it is which makes me re-visit this film over and over, always wanting it to last longer. When I was in a very desperate stage of my hitherto brief life (20 next autumn), Calvero's speech to paralyzed Terry truly saved me. Most of us do insane things to reach happiness, and even insaner things when we fail in our attempts. Calvero should be here to tell us to quit it, and go on. After all, as long as we're conscious, we can still be in hysterics of laughter at Chaplin's act with Buster Keaton towards the end of this film.Swedish critic and poet Lars Forssell has remarked that Chaplin with LIMELIGHT says little which he had not already expressed to greater effect in pantomime. I admire the work of Forssell, but think that he here overlooks a radical point; in fact, perhaps the major theme of the story. If we are to sum up the main elements provided in this film, we do indeed have a pretty typical Chaplin-film; a clown falls in love with a girl who in some way is superior to him, this time in the sense that she's got most of her future ahead, while he's old and ill. However, in previous films, Chaplin had been a clown with the mannerisms of a gentleman, always eager to explore further despite life's many defeats. Being a clown on the surface, the Tramp was playful, childish and acted pretty much by instinct. In this respect, Calvero represents his very counterpoint; he is not a fantasy figure able to survive anything as soon as he does a twist with his ankle, but a very real human being who has gained wisdom from the ups and, for the most part it seems, downs of life. We need to do nothing more complicated than viewing CITY LIGHTS as a contrast; whereas the Tramp had helped the blind by pretending to be someone else, Calvero accepted the world as it went, fighting back when he could, but admitting to be an old sinner. For his entire career, Chaplin had played a clown, and this is his turn to wipe out the make-up and speak to us from underneath. If you think it gets too chatty, that's your problem. A clown is supposed to do pantomime on the stage. Here he's left it.However, what is particularly fascinating with LIMELIGHT is that it not only speaks for Chaplin, but for the entire music hall-era in which the comedian laid the roots of his art; it is a work based upon a phenomenal life of first-hand experience, hence it does not feel more pretentious or self-centered than it should do. Calvero is the eternal sad clown, whose philosophy is carried through every performer who went the same way as him. (He does in fact bear characteristics of Chaplin's real-life father, who was once a top-bill performer on the stage himself, but eventually drank himself to death while Charlie was a boy.) Although at heart a tragedy, LIMELIGHT is, to me at least, one of the most uplifting films to watch when the clouds of life spread too much of shadow around; I can't say for sure if I'd have felt the same way if I was at Calvero's age, but I really believe there is some hope to be found for whoever needs it in this film.

The cadet corps is run by proud Timothy Hutton. His immediate subordinates include the sensible Sean Penn -- yes, sensible -- and the semi-psychotic Tom Cruise. In overall command is the avuncular General George C. Scott.The problem is that, as Scott announces to the cadets, the school will be closed and sold for its real estate value next Fall. They are going to mow the place down and build condominiums. Scott dies promptly of a heart attack and, led by Cadet Major Hutton, most of the kids confiscate the stores of weapons and lay down a list of demands before they will allow the school to be dissolved. I was all on the side of the cadets. Not that I love military academies but that I hate condominiums. It's rather like why I'm a vegetarian. I hate the taste and texture of vegetables but I love to kill them by eating them raw or boiling them.This film sounds like it has a lot of social relevance -- the military and patriots and men of honor on one side, and the peace-mongering wussies who never had a fist fight on the other. Now we're all going to refight the Vietnam War.But it's not like that at all. Timothy Hutton is a bright kid with leadership qualities only, as it's explained somewhat clumsily, he has reason to hate his father, who is a Sergeant Major, and has found a substitute in General George C. Scott. And therein lies the problem. Hutton has absorbed only part of Scott's message about self discipline, and death before dishonor, and all that elementary stuff. After all, he's only seventeen. It's only with a little seasoning that we can begin to look behind the buzz words.Hutton is supported by Penn because Penn has never walked out on a friend, and it's Penn who finally talks Hutton into ordering the adoption of another common tactic -- declare victory and depart the field. But Tom Cruise is the genuine nut job aboard for this adventure into terra incognito. Throughout, he's always been something of a martinet. He is the leader of a group of red berets. I don't know exactly what they're function is but it appears to be something like the Gestapo's. And while the rest of the cadet corps is marching sullenly and weaponless towards the gate where the National Guard is waiting, Cruise cuts loose from an upper window with an M-60 screaming, It's beautiful! It's BEAUTIFUL! The performances are all pretty good without any being exceptional. The chief weakness is in the script. It's opened up a whole can of worms and doesn't want to get its fingers dirty by digging into it. The problem with pride, honor, and a feeling of knowing more than others, is that that whole assemblage of attitudes can't exist without an enemy. If you're superior, then you must by definition be superior to someone else. In this case, there are only off-hand references to the pencil-pushers and bean counters. Not that the film presents external forces -- the local cops and the National Guard -- as anything other than reasonable or even perfect. But solidarity is self reinforcing. It feels so good to be part of a group that's even only temporarily powerful that often the original goal is lost sight of. That's what happened during the prison riots at Attica. The governor granted some of the inmates demands and the inmates ripped up the concession to great cheers from the throng. Finally the governor granted ALL their wishes -- and an inmate in the center of the yard ripped them up to great cheers from the throng. The point was no longer to have their wishes granted but to relish the momentary sense of power.And the distinction between civilian power over the military is hardly mentioned. It's one of the lessons that Scott apparently never passed on, but it's a fundamental one. It's why our Commander-in-Chief is called a president and not a generalissimo. Here's something the governor and the National Guard might have tried. They might have simply waited the kids out. What the heck. They couldn't have had that much food. The electricity and water could have been shut down. Enthusiasm for the cause was hardly universal -- about half of them quit. Morale would have crumbled eventually. Fads fade quickly among teens.And Tom Cruise's final insane outburst was completely unjustified by what we'd learned of his character earlier, but then it had to happen or we'd all have been denied the pleasure of the final shoot out. We're built for speed and action, not waiting patiently, not thinking things through logically. In a sense, Tom Cruise stands in for part of all of us. And so do the proud Timothy Hutton and the sensible Sean Penn. I hope when we face our next crisis, whether national or personal, we can find some middle ground.

And I loved it. I was a huge fan of the series even back then and thought it was a great entertaining movie.The years have gone by and I have now watched all episodes of the original series and films. Of all the films, this one does contain the most interaction and involvement between ALL the cast members. True, some were for laughs (thanks to Paramount more than Shatner) but overall re-watching it again the one major thing lacking in the film is the BAD ENDING!! The story is not so bad until you watch it all the way to the end, and then it's like ok, next! Structure wise is one's the weakest! Please Keep these three things in mind (PERSONAL OPINION) I think Gene was so upset with Paramount and the past when it came to Trek that he looked at TNG as a new beginning and ANYTHING that was made up to this point with the original cast (especially since Paramount booted him out of the films) would have been disapproved by him. Of course, if this film had made more $$$, then maybe he would have embraced it a little better with private reservations. Second, this film suffered the same fate as the later Batman films from the late 80's and 90's. The first two Batmans were good, but due to studio interference (Warner Bros.) the next two suffered! Some can be blamed on the director, some cannot! Lastly, the main characters of the original trek were always Kirk, Spock and McCoy. The others were always secondary..That is, to help move the stories along. Over time, however, these characters were loved and cherished also. So of course the film is going to focus more on the main rather than secondary characters.The film reminds me of a season three episode re-done in the late 80's. Even though season 3 was not great, it did have some great moments and even the bad episodes can be watched ONLY from the performances and love of the characters\/actors. That's what V is. A return to classic Trek. Not great, but fun. With no knowledge of Trek or love for it, of course this film was doomed to fail! At least II had a great villain and a death scene, III had a mystery of how to get spock back and the destruction of the beloved Enterprise and IV was just a fun time travel escapism. After this, Paramount pitted Shatner (who was to direct under contract) with greed and insistence that more humor than a dark or serious story be included. It was the success of IV that led to the downfall of V. Paramount wanted another action\/comedy film based on the results of IV. However, in Voyage Home it worked. In a story like V, it did not! It was meant to be more of a darker, philosophical Trek than what was produced because of studio interference. Don't believe me? Check out some parts of the film which were very dramatic..* The teaser before the credits really gets you in the mood. A laughing vulcan? very interesting.. * the Nimbus III meeting of the three races is pretty decent and a great opening. All three major aliens to that point (terrans, klingon, romulan!) are actually together and talking things out. Makes sense since the kligons and romulans were trading and the terrans (earth) were in peace negotiations with both. * Most of the campfire scenes with McCoy's statement of being on shore leave and spending time together with Shatner's Other people have families, not us is just so deep. I will say that DeForrest's performance through this picture is just great. * the wonderful meeting of Sybok trying to seduce the trilogy is the highlight with the young father of Spock, Sarek, declaring So Human and Shatner's I need my pain! speech topped by McCoy (DeForrest) wonderful scene with his father. The film was worth watching just for this..the best dramatic character driven scene of the original series. It shows the three characters have definitely aged and not just making a movie. They have matured and stays cannon with the rest of the films. * Kirk's hatred for klingons is still apparent, but kept to a minimum. This is probably due more to Paramount than Shatner as he at least tried to emphasize it in a few scenes. * All the cast at least have something serious to do in this film as opposed to all the others! If this was all on Shatner, why did he even waste his time with even directing everybody else? Very considerate of others from my point of view. The scene with Chekov as Captain of the USS Enterprise trying to negotiate with Sybok was great!Even though disappointing after the success of II-IV, not bad. Those were hard to top. Blame Paramount more than Shatner! He had the Trek idea in hand. VI was only made and successful because of the 25th Anniversary and the studio wanted the original to go out with a bang instead of a flop that THEY had made and knew it. Why Shatner was denied making a director's cut is beyond me! They'd rather put it all on him rather than themselves. Decent movie, just relax and enjoy.

So of course the film is going to focus more on the main rather than secondary characters.The film reminds me of a season three episode re-done in the late 80's. Even though season 3 was not great, it did have some great moments and even the bad episodes can be watched ONLY from the performances and love of the characters\/actors. That's what V is. A return to classic Trek. Not great, but fun. With no knowledge of Trek or love for it, of course this film was doomed to fail! At least II had a great villain and a death scene, III had a mystery of how to get spock back and the destruction of the beloved Enterprise and IV was just a fun time travel escapism. After this, Paramount pitted Shatner (who was to direct under contract) with greed and insistence that more humor than a dark or serious story be included. It was the success of IV that led to the downfall of V. Paramount wanted another action\/comedy film based on the results of IV. However, in Voyage Home it worked. In a story like V, it did not! It was meant to be more of a darker, philosophical Trek than what was produced because of studio interference. Don't believe me? Check out some parts of the film which were very dramatic..* The teaser before the credits really gets you in the mood. A laughing vulcan? very interesting.. * the Nimbus III meeting of the three races is pretty decent and a great opening. All three major aliens to that point (terrans, klingon, romulan!) are actually together and talking things out. Makes sense since the kligons and romulans were trading and the terrans (earth) were in peace negotiations with both. * Most of the campfire scenes with McCoy's statement of being on shore leave and spending time together with Shatner's Other people have families, not us is just so deep. I will say that DeForrest's performance through this picture is just great. * the wonderful meeting of Sybok trying to seduce the trilogy is the highlight with the young father of Spock, Sarek, declaring So Human and Shatner's I need my pain! speech topped by McCoy (DeForrest) wonderful scene with his father. The film was worth watching just for this..the best dramatic character driven scene of the original series. It shows the three characters have definitely aged and not just making a movie. They have matured and stays cannon with the rest of the films. * Kirk's hatred for klingons is still apparent, but kept to a minimum. This is probably due more to Paramount than Shatner as he at least tried to emphasize it in a few scenes. * All the cast at least have something serious to do in this film as opposed to all the others! If this was all on Shatner, why did he even waste his time with even directing everybody else? Very considerate of others from my point of view. The scene with Chekov as Captain of the USS Enterprise trying to negotiate with Sybok was great!Even though disappointing after the success of II-IV, not bad. Those were hard to top. Blame Paramount more than Shatner! He had the Trek idea in hand. VI was only made and successful because of the 25th Anniversary and the studio wanted the original to go out with a bang instead of a flop that THEY had made and knew it. Why Shatner was denied making a director's cut is beyond me! They'd rather put it all on him rather than themselves. Decent movie, just relax and enjoy.

It was the typical western movie about good cowboys fighting against the odds to beat out the bad guys. The typical John Wayne Western. Then, Sergio Leone, invented the infamous Man with no Name. A new step in Westerns, we saw the creation of an anti-hero. Someone who was tough and bad but still had the decency and morality to stand up for others. The evolution of the western has finally evolved to this film; it is the ultimate climax. An amazing look at the violence, notoriety, and tragic history of how the West actually was. Unforgiven took everything about the Western and re-examined it. It is a powerful and dark film that has redefined and brought an end to what can be thought of as a western.William Munny (Eastwood), is a a long time criminal who after fading into retirement, comes out to do one last job with his long time partner Ned Logan (Freeman) and a young gun named The Schofield Kid (Woolvett). They agree to hunt down some criminals who cut up a girl who worked at a house of whores. But the whole thing ends badly when the sheriff of the town where the whores live, Little Bill Daggett (Hackman), goes after Ned and Will because of their vigilante justice.There are several important concepts addressed in the story of Unforgiven. One is the idea of murder. Men are either born to kill or not. Either they can handle it or not. Unforgiven is the perfect example of this. The Schofield Kid is a virgin to killing and wants his opportunity and when he finally gets it, he feels regret and remorse. Yet William Munny has the ability to kill a dozen men, no problem. Either you have it or you don't. Another theme is related to this. William Munny was a man who tried to settle down after his crimes and make peace with himself. He was described as having killed women and children. But when he comes back to that world, he finds out it hasn't changed at all. He is just as capable of repeating his sins as he was years ago. Which shows that William Munny just did not shape himself, but the entire world he lived in shaped him. There is a character in the movie named Beauchamp. He is a writer who wants to understand the ways of the west. He is the person who understands the west as a story of good and bad. The ideals of the typical John Wayne Western Film. How there are bad guys, good guys, and their preconceived stereotypes. Good vs. Bad, Black vs. White. But in the end, when he is confronted by Munny, he learns differently. People like him don't understand the true ideals of the west. The violence, the darkness, the scars that come from that time. The Old West and the lives of people like William Munny, are stories of how dark and unforgiving the old west really was. It was more then just good guys and bad guys; its the reason there is such difficulty in labeling any character as good or bad. There is that gray matter which exists in between them all. In Unforgiven, you have the typical western characters. English Bob (Richard Harris) is the washed-up showboater. All he does is brag about his Golden years and make himself out to be a True Legend of the West. The Schofield Kid is a youngster who thinks he can make it in the big times but of course, he can't. Ned is the loyal and faithful sidekick to the major anti-hero. Little Bill is the tough-ass corrupt sheriff who stops at no measure of brutality and indecency. His past has effected him as much as Munny's and he wants only to be content with what he has done in life. Munny is represented as the anti-hero to an extent but he is also represented as the long time villain seeking redemption (Which we find, he will never truly attain). But all the typical characters of there, examined and laid out, to truly understand what they stand for and their importance in the old west.Don't watch this movie cause its Clint Eastwood's Best Performance or because Hackman won an award for best supporting actor.

Arnold is artificially created in a lab using the DNA of several men who excel in different fields. This DNA is used to artificially inseminate a volunteer woman.

He learns this through falling in love and suffering a sudden tragedy, an event that shocks both him and us, the audience. Such is the grand scope of the film whilst the character is Michael Corleone, the actor is Al Pacino and the film is The Godfather, a setting up of a grand tale revolving around an organised crime outfit in the latter years of the 20th Century.Michael is, of course, laying low because of the organised hit on certain individuals he put himself up to back in New York. I think up to that point, Michael had been a character involved, but not in a particularly spectacular manner, in the film but that consequent event and 'hiding' embeds him into 'the life'; it is his own point of no return that captures the essence of loyalty to one's family when the chance arises to show your worth, but at the same time acts as a demonstration of how easily it is for these people to, despite telling most involved that they're 'straight', get involved in the nastier side of life that others close to them are ultimately involved in.The series' sprawling, but in a good sense, study of life in crime several decades ago begins with 1972's The Godfather and at the rather distinct locale of a wedding, perhaps signifying what all weddings should signify a beginning, a new beginning as the long and unknown road lies ahead &#150; there will be good times, great times but bad times as we advance into the supposed unknown. Such is a synopsis of either Mafia life and the healthy-one-minute-dead-the-next ideation of life in organised crime as well as life following marriage as you venture off into the next chapter with 'the one' at your side. The scenic and pleasant setting of the wedding sees the film immediately establish a juxtaposition of the pleasant; of the upbeat and of the enjoyable clashing with the fact behind closed doors, despite the occasion, gangsters lurk discussing sordid prior activity and acts of brutal retribution in light of these acts.Initially, I think we're supposed to assume the film is about the very man sitting in his office; listening to stories delivered by people who do not (cannot) demand, but crave, action. The Don, Vito Corleone (Brando), sits and listens to whether the situation demands attention. Eventually he deems the immediate opening tale worthy of such Mob retaliation but for a favour in the future. There is a certain nonchalance, an establishing of power in these first scenes, that being before it branches out into the wedding and then into life amongst the Corleone family itself. Additionally, it is said that Vito has contacts in the music industry while a certain humane side to Vito is brought through via the fact it's established he brought into the family an orphan off of the street.But while Vito is the most powerful and the most inspirational character in the film, it isn't necessarily about him. Indeed, early on his adopted son Tom Hagen (Duvall) is engaging with others more than most others, a right hand-man for Vito and a lawyer all the same as he hears and helps deal with the issues and problems that arise for the family. But no, the film isn't really about him either rather it is about organised crime as a whole and how it engulfs these people and what they do. Too much happens in the film to list here, but it is a film driven not by pre-figured plot routines but by acts of honour, betrayal and the realistic decisions made by characters we believe are true to life or 'real'. They act on impulse but stay true to the consistency of their mindsets with Michael's sudden urge to take part in an organised 'hit' acting as a particular event, not because Michael is any sort of protagonist and must propel action, but because prior events to do with a targeted and consequentially injured character and Michael's attitudes to this injured character have built up a certain antagonism within Michael's usually cool mindset.Amongst all this, Michael's romance with a woman named Kay (Keaton) is slotted in rather nicely and, like everything else, is developed at its own pace with assured direction from Coppola. The film doesn't really posses an overly complicated narrative and the events are told in a linear format, but the achievement is in getting across this epic sense of progression.

He learns this through falling in love and suffering a sudden tragedy, an event that shocks both him and us, the audience. Such is the grand scope of the film whilst the character is Michael Corleone, the actor is Al Pacino and the film is The Godfather, a setting up of a grand tale revolving around an organised crime outfit in the latter years of the 20th Century.Michael is, of course, laying low because of the organised hit on certain individuals he put himself up to back in New York. I think up to that point, Michael had been a character involved, but not in a particularly spectacular manner, in the film but that consequent event and 'hiding' embeds him into 'the life'; it is his own point of no return that captures the essence of loyalty to one's family when the chance arises to show your worth, but at the same time acts as a demonstration of how easily it is for these people to, despite telling most involved that they're 'straight', get involved in the nastier side of life that others close to them are ultimately involved in.The series' sprawling, but in a good sense, study of life in crime several decades ago begins with 1972's The Godfather and at the rather distinct locale of a wedding, perhaps signifying what all weddings should signify a beginning, a new beginning as the long and unknown road lies ahead &#150; there will be good times, great times but bad times as we advance into the supposed unknown. Such is a synopsis of either Mafia life and the healthy-one-minute-dead-the-next ideation of life in organised crime as well as life following marriage as you venture off into the next chapter with 'the one' at your side. The scenic and pleasant setting of the wedding sees the film immediately establish a juxtaposition of the pleasant; of the upbeat and of the enjoyable clashing with the fact behind closed doors, despite the occasion, gangsters lurk discussing sordid prior activity and acts of brutal retribution in light of these acts.Initially, I think we're supposed to assume the film is about the very man sitting in his office; listening to stories delivered by people who do not (cannot) demand, but crave, action. The Don, Vito Corleone (Brando), sits and listens to whether the situation demands attention. Eventually he deems the immediate opening tale worthy of such Mob retaliation but for a favour in the future. There is a certain nonchalance, an establishing of power in these first scenes, that being before it branches out into the wedding and then into life amongst the Corleone family itself. Additionally, it is said that Vito has contacts in the music industry while a certain humane side to Vito is brought through via the fact it's established he brought into the family an orphan off of the street.But while Vito is the most powerful and the most inspirational character in the film, it isn't necessarily about him. Indeed, early on his adopted son Tom Hagen (Duvall) is engaging with others more than most others, a right hand-man for Vito and a lawyer all the same as he hears and helps deal with the issues and problems that arise for the family.

At times we actually debated whether it was this bad on purpose but we're pretty sure it's not. First of all, an alien egg appears out of nowhere as if it was the most natural thing in the world, then there's a fire and all the main characters from the previous movie except Ripley are conveniently killed. Enter Clemens, a doctor on a remote prison planet with a sad history and a future to match. He finds Ripley on the beach. They perform an autopsy on the crash victims, attend the funeral and have sex. Next, another alien appears and slaughters the prisoners (and the doctor, ouch!) one by one all over the prison, an industrial\/Gothic scenery that was utterly ripped off from the first movie. So was the plot, apparently, only the astronauts from Alien are replaced by filthy British prisoners who are absolutely impossible to distinguish, much less like much. The amount of profanity in this movie is hilarious! You will also enjoy the hammy acting performances. In one particular scene, the prison warden is killed right in front of the prisoners, one looks up sheepishly and exclaims *beep* And just when you thought the acting couldn't get any worse, the gang leader motivates the other prisoners to fight the alien in another hilariously overacted scene. The creature effects were so awful it made us laugh while we replayed through the worst scenes. The movie is supposed to end on a down note but it doesn't work because it's too corny to be taken seriously.

It was like an old friend saying hello and I did really enjoy the film.I mean you got to see how C3P0 and R2D2 came about as well, for the first time you got see the Jedi council (always talked about in the first 3 star wars films) and also Darth Vader as a child... All things mentioned or discussed in the first 3 films you finally get to see in this first film and was it great. The light saber battle at the end was fantastic and so was the pod race, also the bit where you first got to see the planet corscant was great as well Certain people have criticised the fact that Darth Vader was referred to as Annie What!!!!! Why are you criticising that, what would you call a child Death, Mean Boy I mean come on he was a child at this point no one ever knew he was going to grow up and be Darth Vader.Also some people have criticised the whole medi-chlorine thing, however Lucas can't win. If he does not give enough detail then he is criticised and if he does then he is still criticised come on people !!!!! Oh and the person criticising the planet called Naboo what !!!! Seriously do you think your not being a tad unfair what do you expect was it any worse then calling something a Minot (like Han in empire strikes back) The only scepticism I had with the film is Anakins age, I did think he was to young to honestly believe that him and Padme would be lovers But overall a good film and I do recommend it There has been a high amount of criticism aimed at Jar Jar, now I must admit he was not my favourite character but was he any worse then chewy, at least with Jar Jar you could partially understand the film but with chewy you could not understand a damn thing!!!!!

","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"10 March 2009","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" This very enjoyable witty and sophisticated parody of an independent motion picture company selecting a small town in Vermont as a location to make a major film, after being ejected from a small town in New Hampshire (for some unspecified bad behavior), is kind of a David Mamet family project. Mamet is credited as the writer and director. The most compelling character in the film, Ann, who owns and runs the town's book store and heads the town drama club, is played excellently by Mamet's wife, Rebecca Pidgeon. Her brother, Matthew Pidgeon, has a bit part as a British TV newscaster, Mamet's brother Tony plays an electrician. While on the subject of the cast, Broadway musical great Patti LuPone does a nice job, in a very minor role, as the small town Mayor's wife who apparently has high society ambitions and apparently money enough to back up that ambition. She is not someone you want to make angry because the Mayor (Charles Durning effortlessly playing a kind of mild- mannered role I've seen him in before) is also the Town Council. As long as his wife is happy he is thrilled to have the company use his town. Major movie star and heartthrob Bob Barrenger (Alec Baldwin), the male lead of the movie that the fictional film company is making, is an oblivious sex addict with a taste for underage girls. His activities are one of the major problems the film director (William H. Macy) and producers face. Another is that the lead actress (Sarah Jessica Parker), who was cast because of her contractual agreement to play a nude scene as she has done in several earlier films, has changed her mind. A third crisis for the producers has to do with the town's historic mill that was the main reason they chose the town, and a fourth is a splendid stained glass window that is in the way of a crucial camera shot.I would have preferred that the film had a different title than  State and Main. Perhaps something such as The Old Mill Set or Second Chance. I think I noticed two goofs in the film When a date on the white board has to be written again because it is accidentally erased, it is clearly rewritten on the same date as the original. In a critical later scene it is at a different date. The other is Joseph Turner White (Philip Seymour Hoffman), the fictional first time screenwriter and author of the fictional book the fictional film is based on, says at one point that he has perjured himself although he knows at that time that he was not really under oath when he lied. When watching State and Main, don't turn it off before the credits or you'll miss some of the wit.
