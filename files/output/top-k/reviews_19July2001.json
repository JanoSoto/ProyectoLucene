The beginning may be somewhat boring, but that's what you should have come to expect from this trilogy. The movie is shorter in length than the first two; not necessarily a bad thing by any stretch. This actually forced less boring stoppages of dialogue and more dinosaur encounters. Because let's face it, if your going to an action movie expecting lots of dialogue and story developing most of the time you will be sorely disappointed. It was nice to see the introduction of 3 new dinosaurs that were unseen in the past Spinosaurus, Pteranodon, and Ankylosaurus (wasn't named in the film, the one that looks like a tank). There were times when you could tell that some of dinosaurs were computer generated, but for the most part they seemed real. The only thing that really bothered me was its very abrupt ending. Kind of let me down. I'd say even 10 more minutes of leading to the ending would have made it much better. Most of the different action scenes were very thrilling, I personally liked the Ptranodon scene best of all, which is no surprise when you consider Johnston's skills in making good scenes involving flight. One more thing I want to touch upon before I finish, and this contains a small spoiler about the number of people that die. I've seen people complain that not enough people die, but I think these people may have just been spoiled by Lost World. Many people died in that one in various scenes, but that was also due to dinosaurs interacting with more people. In the first Jurassic Park, 5 people died. In JP3 4 died.Overall, I'd just like advise you to check this movie out at least once. If the only reasons you are going is for gore, people's deaths, and dialogue you will be disappointed from in those aspects.

Kind of let me down. I'd say even 10 more minutes of leading to the ending would have made it much better. Most of the different action scenes were very thrilling, I personally liked the Ptranodon scene best of all, which is no surprise when you consider Johnston's skills in making good scenes involving flight. One more thing I want to touch upon before I finish, and this contains a small spoiler about the number of people that die. I've seen people complain that not enough people die, but I think these people may have just been spoiled by Lost World. Many people died in that one in various scenes, but that was also due to dinosaurs interacting with more people. In the first Jurassic Park, 5 people died. In JP3 4 died.Overall, I'd just like advise you to check this movie out at least once. If the only reasons you are going is for gore, people's deaths, and dialogue you will be disappointed from in those aspects. But I'm sure you will love the major action sequences and the faster pace of this movie than its predecessors. It's worth a look.

Some might think it nice to have nothing but cerebral films with complex plots and interweaving storylines, but now and then some of us find it refreshing to have a movie that simply entertains.  What were the best parts of the first Jurassic Park film? The parts with the dinosaurs, of course.  The second film tried to give us more dino-action, but when the story moved to San Diego the T-Rex was not the only one guilty of running amok (wink, wink... Mr. Spielberg). Jurassic Park III is a fast-paced, exciting, roller-coaster ride of a movie.  There is plenty of dinosaur action and mayhem, and the characters are there to serve the story.  So what if there isn't that much to it. What does one expect?  The movie quickly moves us through the setup and into the action.  Sam Neill does a wonderful job of reprising his role as Dr. Alan Grant, and the companion characters do a fine job a creating plenty of situations that make for some rousing action set-pieces.  Bravo Joe Johnston for stepping into some big shoes and making a fun popcorn movie that, while not as novel as the first in the series (how could it be?), is every bit as enjoyable to watch.

However, I cannot believe that anyone can rate this film less than an 8\/10 for several reasons.First and foremost, the CG animation is, without question, the best the world of film has EVER seen.  I think ten seconds of this film would take my PC about three years to render.  In assessing the quality of the animation, one has to ask themselves Has anyone ever done any better?  I don't think anyone can truthfully answer yes.  Thus begins the comparison to the highly acclaimed anime film Princess Mononoke.  While Mononoke possesses very good animation, Final Fantasy's visuals are a true work of the utmost artistry and the pinnacle of animation craftsmanship.  Final Fantasy set out to push the limits of what CG animation can do and did a spectacular job.  When the creators were asked wouldn't it have been easier to make this film live-action? they responded by saying, Yes.  But we're doing this BECAUSE it is challenging!  (not a direct quote so don't get angry).

Really, Princess Mononoke isn't very original, so why expect so much from Final Fantasy?

By placing the real people in the action of the old film, thus bringing the killer of the old film to them.None of this stuff is scary any more. When you go, you go for fun. If you were only going to see only one of these 3 films, you should make it Cut.

The plot is at a minimal (Boy gest lost on island.  Parents go with rescue team.  Survivors try to get off the island), but it gets the job done.  The acting is good enough for the most part, and Sam Neil does a fine job as Dr. Grant.  More importantly, the real stars of this movie, the dinosaurs, return and look fantastic.  The film is very fast-paced, and no time is wasted jumping into the action.  After only a few minutes, everyone is on the island, running away from dinos.  This is obviously quite different from the way Jurassic Park 1 opened, but this is the third film in the franchise, and the plotline about the dinosaur park has already been established.  The audience came to see dinos, and dinos they saw. The thing that really bogs the film down is the lack of continuity it has with the previous ones.  Dinosaurs look completely different from the way they did in the first film (Raptors are now purple...Brachiosaurus are sorta spotted..)  Also, one of the big, albeit cheesy plot points is that Grant has discovered through fossils that Raptors were smarter than they had ever imagined.  So, the raptors in JP3 are now really smart, which is really frustrating to watch because they weren't anywhere near as intelligent in the first film.  Also, Grant discovered that Raptors can communicate, so right on cue, the raptors in this film talk to each other, which they obviously didn't do in the first film. But, I suppose those are just a few minor problems.  The biggest problem of the film is its abrupt ending, which comes out of nowhere.  The audience never really got an epic finale, as the movie just ended in an incredibly hokey way after one of its action sequences. Overall, the film is very entertaining to watch and downright creepy in some spots.  What it lacks in intelligence it makes up in excitement.

","genre":"Comedy, Sport"},{"date":"19 July 2001","score":"","review":"  I am no way condoning these sport(s) when I write these reviews, nor am I condoning the sport(s) when writing reviews. My view on the sport(s) do not effect the outcome of the review. If this were true it would be unethical.Bring it On. Cheerleaders compete for superiority and the best dance routine. Starts off with a decent sport movie plot. I thought it could be watchable. The movie starts. I am in a bus on the way to Chicago, just done eating 50 (Yes, Virginia, 50) chicken nuggets. I feel queasy. I don't know why. I continue watching. The first dialogue is spoken. The s**t hits the fan.  I gag, and loudly at that.  And, no its not the chicken. The first cheer passes. I want to scream, losing all notions of sanity left in my poor, tired body (Hey, 4 hours in a cramped bus is enough to make anyone battered like Shake & Bake). I reluctantly resume watching, felling a fire burn deep within my soul. I think that was the last bit of sophistication going *pop*. I think I blacked out a few times, but I don't recall. The better I don't, for fear of remebering the movie.Well, in case you can't tell, I did not care for this movie. And, also, in case you can't tell, that was a bigger understatement than saying the average porno has no nudity. This was THE WORST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN!!Go though this site, you'll see some pretty bad ones, but this is just...o god...I honest to god dont know why I am even bothering to mention and write about this movie. It is just so...horrid... The mere fact that this was meant to be taken seriously makes chills run up and down my spine.  Not like MST3K movies, whom are made for the reason of laughing at them.  No, this has to be about the happy blond and the evils of the minor key outcast, whom the cheerleaders help by making her conform to the perfect image of society.  An I don't care what you say, by this movie's standards, cheerleaders look pretty, but never get the guys.Acting No humanly words can explain this. Possibly if I went into come Arcane rituals, and conjured up a demon, and mentioned this movie, his shriek would be words in its own. 3\/10Director Any GOOD directior would have given up this idea from the script, but he did well with what he had, which leads us to... 5\/10Script I don't know where to start. The beginning to the end had the word TRITE written all over it. It was not witty, not funny, nonsensical gibberish with buzz words thrown in. My dog could have crapped out something better. The only thing worse is... -4\/10Message This is what I found 1) Be part of the crowd. People like you better when you're like them. Individuality is the devil, and being different is sacrieligous. Everyone knows this, like, DUH! 2) If you don't cheat, you will lose. If you do, you will win! 3) Nobody in High School is nice, and everyone is on the football team. If you do not fit all these requirements, you are not a good person. Shame shame. -26\/10Audience Cheerleaders, desperate men, maybe some bad dancers, thats about it. 3\/10Overall This movie hits its demographic of MTV wanna-bes and giddy blondes. This is not a real movie. It is more or less a bunch of oddly shaped smudges on film that look like people, with voices thrown in. I honestly do not know how any intelligent person could watch this move for more than 5 minutes. God how i wish the principals of the Matrix applied now.(it is not real, the matrix just makes you think its real...)-8\/10Final Thoughts Unwatchable. The worst message and dialogue ever mode in a movie (including porno). Do not rent or buy, unless intent on burning the movie or sending it to a similar fate. Like I stated previously, no words can explain the badness of this film.P.S I felt really good after writing this. It is like a great weight has been lifted from me shoulders.P.P.S  This is a cheerocracy.  'And your a cheerdictator'  Ok. going back to the upper world to maim the writers of this movie.  heh heh no one will ever know....Do'h.  ","genre":"Comedy, Sport"}]
