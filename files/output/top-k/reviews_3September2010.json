More than the contents, it is the very fact that the film was made that disturbs. To me it is clearly a retelling of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, yet of all the comments and reviews I've come across about this film I haven't heard Frankenstein once. They don't recognise it because it's poured over with sugar &#x96; Spielbergian sugar. The monster is so deeply buried in the sugar that people end up commenting on the surface texture of the candy, or just the wrapping. OK, who let a sugar coated monster into society? It's not just the film-makers, because they knew very little about it. It's the whole lot of us &#x96; the audience, the professional reviewers, the education system that stifles our thinking, the rampant commercialism that doesn't allow us to see beyond our next incoming dollar, all of that is responsible. And therefore AI is a monstrosity that reflects our own selves. That's why it's so more disturbing. Those who recognise it are horrified. Just read through the comments posted here and you'll see what I mean. People are saying that they were bored, but their passionate comments sounds more like anger to me. They wish that they never saw the film, and I felt the same way too. I felt dirty, used, and very angry. More so because I had to see it with my kids. I just hope they forget the experience quickly enough.We have a scientist who wants to make a robot who can love. One of his colleagues correctly points out that love only works both ways, and if the scientist can't love his circuitry back then he can't have a loving robot in the first place. To this the scientist answers back, Didn't God create Adam to love him in the first place? OK, so he's playing God. No, in fact it's worse. He wants to go one better than God, because God loved Adam back, but the scientist doesn't feel the need to love his machine at all. The first is called Satanic megalomania. The second is plain lunacy. It appears that the makers of the film adhere to the second school. So we are pitched into a story where we are supposed to believe that a mother can love her adopted robot child. But the script soon discovers that this isn't possible, so we are left with an abandoned robot in a hostile world, crying out incessantly that he want to be real and wants to be loved. At this point the makers of the film have forgotten the original question, Can you love a robot back? It's now all about, can the robot child get what he wants, a loving mother. It can't be done for real, so let's get in the super-sophisticated alien technology to make him a clone mother for a day. In a nutshell, the ultimate freak-show.If you can't love the robot back, then what you have on your hands is the worst monstrosity. Victor Frankenstein realised that in a flash, as soon as he saw the monster twitch into life in front of him. I think Stanley Kubrick saw it too, and that's why he abandoned the film mid-way. But Spielberg doesn't notice anything amiss. I think Spielberg is the real robot child in this whole saga. He is a creation of high tech and youth pandering society. He is all childish optimism, and buoyed by commercial success, he has stayed that way. He believes that there is nothing that technology cannot solve, and if not now then bring in the aliens to do the job. So when Kubrick's abandoned project fell into his lap, he said, Oh, all this needs is some alien-induced sugar. When a little doesn't work he puts in a lot. What we are left with is utterly creepy and disgusting. To me, it's Spielberg who is crying out, I want my Mommy! And it is we who are flying in horror, knowing that we cannot love this inhuman thing, and whose only hope for happiness is to have a clone Mommy for a day, and then dream of her forever after. And then again, it's not all Spielberg's fault. Who encouraged Spielberg in the first place? Where is the intelligence of Mary Shelley in this day and age? What is technology doing to us all? People don't like this film because it raises too many questions about what we are becoming. How can such a film me made on a $90M budget? How can it get a 72% rating on Rotten Tomatoes? Why does nobody cry Frankenstein!? How can the scientist at the centre claim serenely that he wants to go one better than God, and yet fail to elicit any comment from viewers? &#x85; Disturbing indeed!

Braveheart is very well made, the scenery and landscapes are beautifully realised and the cinematography is beautiful. The music is absolutely wonderful and gives plenty of dramatic and emotional weight, easily one of James Horner's best scores. The battle scenes are very well staged, while James Cosmo, Brian Cox and Sophie Marceau among the cast do good work.However, to say this film is inaccurate historically is a understatement in itself. Granted I am no historian, but I took an interest in the subject and even I could tell that any history text-book was literally thrown out of the window.

While some of the actors did a good job, some didn't do so well. Mel Gibson, who I personally don't care for though he has done some films I like, did a better job directing than acting.

It seems as if it could be anyone really fighting the Russians though, and the one distinguishing, quasi-barbaric way of making the Afghani-people stand out is through a brief game that Rambo takes part in that is, uh, you know, kind of like football, only with a dead dog or something. Yeah.But hey, EXPLOSIONS! That's what you come for to Rambo once the first (good) installment is out of the way. However, while First Blood Part 2 had a relentless stream of action, which Rambo III tries to replicate, the only upside Rambo III has is some more basic (and less showy and shiny) cinematography. By this point in the series I wanted to see it just get really crazy, just no-frills holy-s***-what-just-happened action, and it only really started getting that way by the last twenty minutes, when it was relentless, WTF action and deaths and lots of hail-fire from the sky and Rambo defeating Russia with a tank and a gun.

This movie however never claimed to tell a true story or that it's being based on actual events. It's merely a fictional story and movie based on historical events and also real life characters but done in its own way and of course told in an Hollywood fashion. But even though this movie might not be an historically accurate one, it's still one that works out highly realistic.I must say that this is probably one of the movies that does the best job at showing what life as a POW must have been like. Many movies tried to capture this but a very few actually succeeded as well with it as this movie did. The movie manages to create a great atmosphere of despair, fear but also courage and honor. The movie is dealing with a lot of inner conflicts that live within most of these people who had to endure a prison camp and hard labor. Most of these conflicts get personified by only an handful of characters, which in my opinion is one of the movie its strong points. It could had easily dwelled on and inserted many more different characters, mostly purely for dramatic reasons but instead it decides to focus mostly on only just a few key players, from all different sides as well. It keeps the movie more personal and all of its emotions and reactions more effective and understandable.But what also makes the movie so great and intriguing is the fact that it isn't just being a melodramatic movie. Actually the movie has a more positive vibe to it than you might expect from a movie like this. Despite the premise, it's still mostly a movie about hope and trying to make a difference and do the right thing in given circumstances. It's a movie that despite everything also works out as entertainment. It's not always an heavy movie but also one that gets fun and pleasant to watch. In a way you could say that this is one of those first adventurous and entertaining WW II movies some got successfully made off, in mostly the '60's.It's a movie that actually combines a lot of elements. It consists out of many genres and it also has some different story takes in it. But it does this all very seamlessly, so it doesn't ever distract or takes you out of the movie. The movie feels as one great whole, that despite its long running time, always flows very well. It's due to David Lean fine directing and storytelling skills. He was a director who knew how to directed epic movies and big stories. This also was the first movie that earned him an Oscar as a director.This movie actually won 7 Oscar's in total, which not a whole lot of movies can say. It tells you something about the epic quality and impact of this movie.It's a movie that for a large part also relies on its characters and actors playing them. It's perhaps Alec Guinness his most acclaimed movie role out of his career and it also won him his only Oscar. He definitely also plays the best or at least most interest character out of the entire movie, as an officer gentleman who does things literally by the book and all for the greater good and well being of his men and officers. Despite this William Holden always got billed as main actor, simply because he was a much bigger name at the time, that also appealed to a wider, mostly American, audience.It's also a great looking movie, that got shot at location, which obviously add to the realistic look and feel of the movie. The directing and cinematography all take an epic approach, also due to the fact that this was cinemascope movie, that simply required a wider and more epic look.

Well, for one thing, it's his little claim on Italy's shattered post-war economy. Without it, he and his little family don't eat. Besides, with the bike and the poster-hanging job that goes with it, he's got dignity and can brag to his young son Bruno. So, for the next 90 minutes of screen time, he's one determined guy to get it back.It's not like he doesn't have help. His friends fan out, looking here and there, the market- place, the streets. Probably, the bike's in parts now, anyway, like an auto chop-shop. But Ricci doesn't care. By golly, he's going to find whatever is left. After all, the bike is now more than a mere bike. The trouble is there are so darn many of them everywhere you look. It's like trying to find the proverbial drop in the ocean. Worse still are the crowds, everywhere you look, going who knows where. Just as bad, what do they care about his problem since they probably have their own. We know that from the big mob of guys scrambling for work at the beginning. Talk about frustration! All I can say is that President Truman better get the Marshall Plan working or desperate guys like Ricci are going to vote in the Communists, a real possibility in 1948.Now, some folks may find the movie kind of boring since there's no hint of Hollywood glamour or action anywhere, except on a movie poster. Besides, what's all that suspense over something like a cheap bike. But seeing all the real people's faces is unusual and interesting, along with the city streets even though the buildings there are crumbling and ugly. All in all, it looks like this is what you could call a slice-of-life movie, the kind that tells you a lot about other times and places.

Some felt that he had got everything right except the sex of the supreme dictator and that the country was now being run by Big Sister (by which they meant Margaret Thatcher) rather than Big Brother. Others claimed that the novel could be read as a prediction of developments in post- Stalin Russia and post-Mao China where the apparatus of state repression was now being used to defend not the Revolution but the power, status and privileges of the Soviet nomenklatura and its Chinese equivalent. All agreed that Orwell had been prescient in predicting the division of the world into three power blocs, his Oceania, Eurasia and Eastasia corresponding roughly to NATO, the Warsaw Pact and Red China. It was perhaps therefore inevitable that the novel would be filmed in that year. (It had earlier been adapted for television and the cinema in the fifties). There was, however, perhaps a problem. Orwell was not a particularly visual writer; he dealt in words more than pictures, and several phrases coined in the book have passed into our language. (Newspeak, thoughtcrime, doublethink, Thought Police, telescreen, Room 101, Big Brother, etc.). It is notable that many of these words refer either to speech or to thought, and in fact Nineteen Eighty Four is more than just a satire on totalitarianism; it is also an exploration of various philosophical, political and linguistic issues. These are difficult concepts to convey in cinematic form, and the director Michael Radford wisely concentrates more on the anti- totalitarian aspects of the story. Radford and cinematographer Roger Deakins originally wanted to shoot the film in black-and-white, which would have fitted well with Orwell's grim descriptions of existence in the totalitarian superstate of Oceania, but this proved unacceptable to their financial backers. Their solution was to use a process called bleach bypass to create the film's very distinctive washed-out look, dominated by blacks and greys, about as close as a colour film can get to monochrome. There are few, if any, bright colours except in the brief sequences where the film's hero Winston Smith and his lover Julia travel into the countryside. Most of the film is set in a London which has become a bleak urban wasteland. Although the novel is sometimes categorised as science fiction, there are no Star Wars type special effects. Orwell's widow Sonia, shortly before she died in 1980, gave permission for the film on condition that such effects were not used, which was a wise stipulation. Her husband's vision of the future was not a shiny, hi-tech one; Oceanian society has actually regressed technologically since the 1940s as the only new inventions the Party tolerates are those like the telescreens which make it easier for them to control the populace. The film is noteworthy for two remarkable performances, the first from John Hurt as Winston. He is part of the Outer Party, the state's army of bureaucratic functionaries. (The other two social classes in Oceania are the Inner Party, or ruling elite, and the proles, or industrial workers). Although the Outer Party officially form the regime's middle class, they live in squalid, deprived conditions, suggesting that life for the proles must be even harsher. Winston works at the Ministry of Truth (i.e. Ministry of Propaganda) where his job is to rewrite history and official records to make them accord with the current Party line. (Orwell's intention was to satirise Stalin, who had done something very similar, particularly writing Trotsky out of Soviet history). Winston is secretly guilty of thoughtcrime- in Oceania even thinking thoughts critical of the Party is a crime- and joins what he believes is a resistance movement, only to find that he has been betrayed by an agent provocateur. As played by Hurt, Winston is a shabby, middle-aged everyman figure, in some ways pathetic, in others heroic. Apart from Julia, he is the only character prepared to make a stand, however futile, against the evil rule of the Party.Suzanna Hamilton (who seemed to be a promising newcomer but has since disappeared from view) is good as Julia, but the other great performance comes from Richard Burton as O'Brien, the high-ranking Inner Party member who betrays Winston and supervises the physical and mental torture which is designed to break him psychologically. (The Party's greatest desire is not only to crush dissent but also to destroy the very possibility of thoughtcrime). This was Burton's last film; he died shortly after completing it and it is a fitting end to his career. His O'Brien is patient yet remorseless, never becoming angry or raising his voice yet implacable in his belief in the Party and its right to rule. Since the end of the Cold War, only a few years after this film was made, the political concerns which inspired Orwell's book have perhaps not seemed so relevant, at least in the West, although there still remain parts of the world, notably Kim Jong-Il's North Korea, where the system of government is not too dissimilar to that of Big Brother's Oceania. For the rest of us, however, the rise of a totalitarian superstate is perhaps not the greatest threat we have to face. (Something along the lines of Huxley's Brave New World may be a greater danger for our future). This does not, however, mean that the novel itself has lost its relevance and it remains one of the most eloquent denunciations of tyranny in the English language. I will not compare Radford's film to the two earlier adaptations, as it is a long time since I last saw either of them, but it strikes me as a very decent attempt to translate Orwell's eloquence into cinematic terms. 8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"3 September 2010","score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" In the year 1984, when I was a college student, there was much discussion of George Orwell's famous novel, generally concentrating on how far his predictions had come true since he wrote it in 1948.

Human race is obsolete, useless and so weak that now they're dominated by apes who talk like us, fight like us and think like us (or perhaps better if you consider that they're much better than what's left of human).In a distant future Charlton Heston plays the astronaut Taylor and after a failure on his ship he and crew mates end up in a strange place very similar with Earth. While trying to find a way out of this desert and lonely place they discover a few bunch of people who are treated badly by strange figures (the apes) who dominates everything there and they're transformed into slaves. Taylor is able to show some notable abilities that surprises this apes society since humans in this time no longer can speak and he can. Scientists Cornelius (Roddy McDowall) and Zira (Kim Hunter) are the noble creatures that are stunned with this revelation and they're develop with Taylor a relationship based on knowledge trades, with Taylor telling things about his distant planet and the importance of humans. But things are not so easy and Taylor has to fight with the other monkey authorities (they don't believe in Taylor and they want to kill this slave of inferior race). Will Taylor find out what's happening? Will Cornelius and Zira trust this man who they thought was inferior to them? Very intriguing!This film was a great hit in the year of its release and it was a very significant and thoughtful work, but it is even more relevant to watch it now. The idea over the evolution of mankind and how many great things were created and achieved but even so people didn't become more humanized or more positive, and this distance was growing bigger between them, everything was so critical and I think the writers of this movie thought that in the future things could become more frightening and desperate for the human race. And if you remember this was released in the same year of 2001 A Space Odyssey which means that people back then really thought that the future would be marvelous for the evolution of things but not so much interesting in terms of people's evolution. And what's more interesting of both movies is the fact that they've used in their stories the ape figure, the primal force of the evolution of man, the creature that started all for us and in both movies they're intelligent creatures and their actions always resembles our own actions. With that in mind it only proves the theory of Evolution and people have to accept that bipedal mankind started with monkeys. The last quote of the very last scene is one of the most powerful ever delivered by a character in a sci-fi movie. A warning sign for all generations to take care of our planet and take care of ourselves because evolution can walk backwards. The movie is very good, but if wasn't for too many speeches and theories about humans and the trial and escapes of the hero it would be more fun to watch, especially for the younger generations (since this movie doesn't have too much action and people nowadays demands for action all the time).

But things are not so easy and Taylor has to fight with the other monkey authorities (they don't believe in Taylor and they want to kill this slave of inferior race). Will Taylor find out what's happening? Will Cornelius and Zira trust this man who they thought was inferior to them? Very intriguing!This film was a great hit in the year of its release and it was a very significant and thoughtful work, but it is even more relevant to watch it now. The idea over the evolution of mankind and how many great things were created and achieved but even so people didn't become more humanized or more positive, and this distance was growing bigger between them, everything was so critical and I think the writers of this movie thought that in the future things could become more frightening and desperate for the human race. And if you remember this was released in the same year of 2001 A Space Odyssey which means that people back then really thought that the future would be marvelous for the evolution of things but not so much interesting in terms of people's evolution. And what's more interesting of both movies is the fact that they've used in their stories the ape figure, the primal force of the evolution of man, the creature that started all for us and in both movies they're intelligent creatures and their actions always resembles our own actions. With that in mind it only proves the theory of Evolution and people have to accept that bipedal mankind started with monkeys. The last quote of the very last scene is one of the most powerful ever delivered by a character in a sci-fi movie. A warning sign for all generations to take care of our planet and take care of ourselves because evolution can walk backwards. The movie is very good, but if wasn't for too many speeches and theories about humans and the trial and escapes of the hero it would be more fun to watch, especially for the younger generations (since this movie doesn't have too much action and people nowadays demands for action all the time). All the performances are good and the fantastic makeup effects on the actors playing the apes really worked well here. A very good movie that really gets better and better with the time. 9\/10 ","genre":"Adventure, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"3 September 2010","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Spoilers.This is a wholly unremarkable, but also inoffensive, adaptation of a John Grisham novel that serves only to make me believe I haven't really missed a lot by never reading any of the good Mr. Grisham's work.

Chad Gates returns to his home in Hawaii, where his wealthy parents want him to go to work at his father's Great Southern Hawaiian Fruit Company. Chad, however, would rather spend his days surfing and hanging out at the beach with his friends and his pretty half-Hawaiian girlfriend Maile (pronounced Miley). He realises, however, that he needs to take up some sort of occupation, so he starts as a tour guide at the travel agency where Maile works. His first assignment is to show a schoolmistress and a group of her teenage students around the island and complications ensue when both the teacher, Abigail, and Ellie, one of her pupils, fall for Chad. It has been said that this film set the tone for Elvis Presley's future film career; a musical romantic comedy featuring pretty locations, prettier girls, mediocre songs and banal plots. Several of his later films would also fit this formula, including his two others set in Hawaii, Girls! Girls! Girls! and Paradise, Hawaiian Style. (Presley did not spend all his time working for the Hawaii tourist board; he was equally ready to offer his services to other prime holiday destinations, hence the likes of Fun in Acapulco or Viva Las Vegas). None of these films made any great demands on his acting skills, and in Blue Hawaii he is (as he often was) so laid-back as to be practically horizontal. Although Elvis was, in chronological terms, still young (only 26) when he made this film, he was, in career terms, already middle-aged. Gone was the hip-swivelling Elvis the Pelvis of the mid-fifties, the wild young rock-and-roller denounced from pulpits all across America as a danger to the morals of the nation's youth. In his place was Elvis the lounge singer, a younger, better-looking version of Frank Sinatra or Bing Crosby, crooning a string of bland, middle-of-the-road easy- listening numbers, in this film often with a vaguely Hawaiian flavour. Only occasionally does he break into anything resembling rock-and-roll. The only memorable song here is his well-known hit Can't Help Falling in Love, and even that is a gentle romantic ballad, unlikely to be denounced from the pulpit of even the most censorious preacher. In some of Elvis' films his leading ladies were well-known actresses, such as Ursula Andress in Fun in Acapulco or Ann-Margret in Viva Las Vegas, but here his love interest is the attractive but obscure Joan Blackman. The only other actor of any celebrity in the movie is Angela Lansbury who plays Chad's mother Sarah Lee. Lansbury started her career in the mid forties playing pretty young things, but by the time of Blue Hawaii she had settled down into what was to be her normal niche of playing women considerably older than her actual age. (In 1961 she was 36, only ten years older than Elvis himself). She plays Sarah Lee with an exaggerated, stagey southern drawl; the Gates family are supposed to have moved to Hawaii from Georgia, a detail presumably inserted to explain away Elvis' own southern accent, but Sarah Lee ends up speaking with a quite different accent from either her son or her husband. Lansbury later rated her performance here as one of the worst in her career and it is hard to disagree with her. Blue Hawaii was clearly intended as wholesome family entertainment, but there are two points at which it might cause some raising of eyebrows today. The first is the (presumably) unintentional double entendre which occurs when Maile asks Chad whether he can satisfy a teacher and four teenagers. The second comes when Chad picks Ellie up, puts her across his knee and gives her a good spanking. Ellie is, admittedly, an obnoxiously spoilt and sulky little brat, seventeen going on six- it is not hard to see why Chad prefers the more placid Maile- but even so such behaviour would today count as either sexual harassment or criminal assault. Perhaps in the early sixties there was a clause in Hawaiian state law permitting tour guides to administer corporal punishment to unruly teenagers.My copy of Blue Hawaii is a DVD recently given away free as part of a newspaper promotion, which suggests that there must still be a market for this sort of thing, as they are hardly going to give away films that nobody wants to watch. Presumably that market consists of die-hard subjects of King Elvis, especially the older generation who can still remember him in his prime.

He starts out as a real greenhorn, barely able to keep himself alive. Then he meets a grizzled old hunter of grizzly bears named Bear Claw (Will Geer), who takes Jeremiah in and teaches him how to survive. Leaving Bear Claw behind to make his own way, Jeremiah comes upon a family of settlers murdered by Indians. Only a mother driven mad by grief and a young boy survived. Jeremiah takes the boy into his care and then meets another mountain man named Del Gue (Stefan Gierasch), who pushes them into taking revenge on the Indians who slew the settlers. He also ends up getting Jeremiah married to a beautiful Indian girl named Swan (Delle Bolton). Jeremiah, Swan and the boy he names Caleb become a family, until Jeremiah is called upon to help settlers trapped in the mountains. That act of mercy has terrible consequences, leading to a cycle of revenge and death that make a legend of Jeremiah Johnson.The first thing you should know about this movie is that there's not much of a plot, in the sense of events connecting to other events and leading to a big climax. This story is more Guy goes into mountains. Stuff happens. So, if you're looking for a fast-moving and clear narrative, you won't find it here.Aside from that, Jeremiah Johnson is a very enjoyable film. It's very much a scenery Western where the awesome beauty of the Rocky Mountains is as important to the story as any character. It makes a great setting for a screenplay that tries to say as much with silence as it does with dialog. Will Geer and Stefan Gierasch play colorful characters without making them into caricatures. Delle Bolton and Josh Albee don't let the fact that they never speak of word of English prevent them from expressing real emotion. Robert Redford has to carry the movie as a very unflashy and stoic man, but he manages to find the subtleties in someone who wants to make his own life away from the rest of the world.This movie also deserves praise for it's careful and balanced portrayal of the conflict between white settlers and Indian tribes. It doesn't shy away from the dangers Indians posed, but it frames their violent attacks in the context of a people whose land is being invaded by alien outsiders. The story feels no need to condemn or justify either side of the white\/Indian conflict.Jeremiah Johnson is also film that everyone who's ever flirted with Libertarianism should probably see. It demonstrates the allure of the lone man freed from the burdens and responsibilities of society. It's also very clear on how you vs. the world can be a punishingly brutal life.This is a good movie that's held up quite well over time. You might need to have a little patience with it, but it will be worth the effort.

It's very much a scenery Western where the awesome beauty of the Rocky Mountains is as important to the story as any character. It makes a great setting for a screenplay that tries to say as much with silence as it does with dialog. Will Geer and Stefan Gierasch play colorful characters without making them into caricatures. Delle Bolton and Josh Albee don't let the fact that they never speak of word of English prevent them from expressing real emotion. Robert Redford has to carry the movie as a very unflashy and stoic man, but he manages to find the subtleties in someone who wants to make his own life away from the rest of the world.This movie also deserves praise for it's careful and balanced portrayal of the conflict between white settlers and Indian tribes. It doesn't shy away from the dangers Indians posed, but it frames their violent attacks in the context of a people whose land is being invaded by alien outsiders. The story feels no need to condemn or justify either side of the white\/Indian conflict.Jeremiah Johnson is also film that everyone who's ever flirted with Libertarianism should probably see. It demonstrates the allure of the lone man freed from the burdens and responsibilities of society. It's also very clear on how you vs. the world can be a punishingly brutal life.This is a good movie that's held up quite well over time. You might need to have a little patience with it, but it will be worth the effort.

It celebrates his stoic glory but doesn't flinch from a harsh life that very few were fit for.Jeremiah Johnson (Robert Redford) is a man fresh out of the army who wants only to leave the world behind for the mountain wilderness of Colorado. He starts out as a real greenhorn, barely able to keep himself alive. Then he meets a grizzled old hunter of grizzly bears named Bear Claw (Will Geer), who takes Jeremiah in and teaches him how to survive. Leaving Bear Claw behind to make his own way, Jeremiah comes upon a family of settlers murdered by Indians. Only a mother driven mad by grief and a young boy survived. Jeremiah takes the boy into his care and then meets another mountain man named Del Gue (Stefan Gierasch), who pushes them into taking revenge on the Indians who slew the settlers. He also ends up getting Jeremiah married to a beautiful Indian girl named Swan (Delle Bolton). Jeremiah, Swan and the boy he names Caleb become a family, until Jeremiah is called upon to help settlers trapped in the mountains. That act of mercy has terrible consequences, leading to a cycle of revenge and death that make a legend of Jeremiah Johnson.The first thing you should know about this movie is that there's not much of a plot, in the sense of events connecting to other events and leading to a big climax. This story is more Guy goes into mountains. Stuff happens.

And I did. The title may be generic and there may be the odd cliché, but The American President is very likable and entertaining with a Frank Capra feel to it without being Rob Reiner's best. The story has a nice balance of comedy and seriousness, while the screenplay sparkles not only in the more romantic moments but especially in the final speech which was simply brilliant in both writing and delivery. Rob Reiner's direction is outstanding, while the production values are lovely and the music superb. The acting is faultless. Michael Douglas is very commanding in the lead role(that is different from his other roles I noticed) and Annette Bening in a performance that combines slinky sophistication and bubbly wit is terrific. The support from Martin Sheen, Richard Dreyfuss and especially Michael J. Fox is also top drawer. All in all, very good. 8\/10 Bethany Cox ","genre":null},{"date":"3 September 2010","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Having loved Stand By Me, When Harry Met Sally, The Princess Bride and This is Spinal Tap, I saw The American President hoping I would at least like it.

It looks good, has a nice soundtrack, has a (I think) terrific script, good pacing, a fun story and above-decent direction from Mike Nichols. As for favourite scenes, there are some great scenes, but who can forget the dinner scene? The whole film is worth watching just for that scene for so many reasons. And the acting I had no problem with whatsoever. Robin Williams underplays but still delivers the laughs solidly, while Gene Hackman proves he is great as a comic actor. Dianne Wiest, Calista Flockhart and Hank Azaria also give terrific turns, however it is Nathan Lane's hilarious turn as Albert that steals the show. All in all, this is very good and very funny and charming. 8\/10 Bethany Cox ","genre":null},{"date":"3 September 2010","score":"","review":" Granted The Birdcage isn't perfect, it is a little too long and the ending came across as rather sudden, but I was really surprised at how much I enjoyed this film.
