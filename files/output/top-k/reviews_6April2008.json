In consequence of that she becomes and easy target for the plan of the spaceballs. They want to steal the air from Vespa's planet and kidnapping her is the perfect way to extort the King Roland. In another story, the friends Lone Starr (Bill Pullman) and Barf (John Candy) own a lot of money to Pizza the Hutt so they are hired for the King Roland to save his daughter.In the 10th anniversary of the Sci-fi masterpiece Star Wars, Mel Brooks created a hilarious parody of the Sci-fi universe, mostly of that trilogy. I really love and enjoyed this film, mostly because there's a hilarious situation in almost every sequence and all the characters have many memorable scenes with great and funny dialogs. The film has like three different stories with the Princess Vespa, Dark Helmet (Rick Moranis) and Lone Starr being the principal characters of the stories. For me the situations with the President Skroob, played in a great way by Mel Brooks, are the best in the film just as the stupid acts of Dark Helmet and company. The detail when we realize that this real story is just a film is nothing but hilarious with three of my favourites scenes of the film, the one with the videotape of Spaceballs, when the actors accidentally kills one man of the crew and when Yogurt (Mel Brooks too) shows all the merchandise of the film. But is not just pure Star Wars, it has references to Star Trek, Transformers, Jaws and some others but my favourite is the reference to Alien, with the cameo of John Hurt. Is just hilarious to see the chestbursted Dancing and singing like Michigan J. Frog. Anyway, near the end we can see how recognized were the spaceballs in the entire universe, even in the Planet of the Apes.Conclusion this is a terrific film that goes amazingly fast. Mel Brooks is just great but I haven't watched all of his films so I'm not going to say if this is his best. But one thing is for sure, Spaceballs is just fun and maybe the best parody of the Sci-fi universe. 9.5 out of 10Region 4 DVD yesterday I bought this film on a single-disc DVD released by Metro Goldwyn Mayer. It is really good but I have to mention that the box contains two mistakes. It says that the runtime of the feature is 135 minutes, so I thought that they were counting the 95 minutes of the film plus the runtime of the extras that are, according to box, a behind the scenes of the film and commentaries. But the DVD only has the trailer so is another mistake or maybe they were just making fun inventing extras, I don't know.

Death Wish is in fact a dark, gritty, violent and very disturbing look at vigilantism, violence, and so much more. In many ways Death Wish is considered almost campy and yet it has this violent disturbing nature that must have been downright shocking during it's release in 1974 because even now it holds up as being quite disturbing. The rape scene in the beginning would be lucky to manage not getting an NC-17 slapped on it nowadays let alone back then. Director Michael Winner has had great experience in directing and writing and has a really unique style that fits well with Death Wish. This isn't just some random flick about a guy blowing bad guys away, there is a real element of drama and intensity and emotion that is explored not only in this first film but in future installments as well. Although some might say the series was over used and abused there was good reason to continue Kersey's fight.Charles Bronson can be an acquired taste and I would say he is absolutely one of my favorite old time actors. He has this hard, steely, masculinity in his performances and he has had some truly great roles and this original go around for Death Wish was one of them. Even though we've seen him in some really kick butt action roles he manages to introduce us to family man, business man Paul Kersey who finds an outlet for his anger and grief in blowing away crooks, mostly muggers. His character has a significant arc and you can see the changes in him following the crime. He really lights up the screen in a serious dramatic emotional and yet action packed role. Steven Keats, Hope Lange, and Kathleen Tolan are the main supporting cast plays Bronson's son in law, wife and daughter. They don't have a whole lot of time on screen except for the actual happening of the crime which as mentioned is pretty brutal but they serve their purpose to set up the story but don't really take away from Bronson's one man vengeance show. Vincent Gardenia is the main cop sent to stop Bronson's vendetta but not to necessarily kill him but get him to stop so as to not make him a martyr. Gardenia is good but his role is small and I would have liked to have seen more of a cat and mouse, adversary type relationship between them but it never really pans out.Ultimately Death Wish poses the question it means to which is do you believe that Kersey's vendetta is right or is he as bad as they are? One thing that is almost campy and unbelievable is how much crime does exist around Kersey in particular. I mean everywhere he goes...Subway, buildings, random street someone tries to mug or rob him so he can blow them away. I mean crime is bad...even know let alone 30 years ago but that rampant should mean everyone should carry a loaded pistol to blow bad guys away. He also never really resolves his wifes case which is unfortunate but instead he finds this relief in fighting crime in the most brutal manner. Still Death Wish is a cult classic and a must see and it doesn't disappoint for entertainment value or even for a more serious message behind it.

This means WAR! First they messed with high society in Animal Crackers. Next they wrecked havoc on a cruise liner in Monkey Business. Then they unleashed their antics on the college campus in Horse Feathers. But this time, it's war! The Marx Brothers latest outing, Duck Soup is their funniest, most streamlined, and by far my favorite Marx movie, and it is the first movie on the odyssey that I already have memorized. I'll take this one over 'Night at the Opera' any day. The movie starts out like an achingly routine politics-and-manners play. But when Groucho makes his entrance, it's a non-stop romp from there. Margaret Dumont is at her best. In the previous films, her timing with Groucho was a little shaky. It would go like this Dumont would act regal, Groucho would toss out a non-sequiter, Dumont would pause to regain her bearings before the next line. Now the awkward pauses are gone, and Dumont never quits, no matter what Groucho says to her. My favorite moment from her is late in the film, when she puts in one last effort to prevent war and must watch helplessly as Groucho inevitably fouls it up. Edgar Slow Burn Kennedy is a stitch as the burly lemonade vendor who is repeatedly tormented by Chico and Harpo. After watching those scenes for the 18th time, I started to see that while certain comic beats may look chaotic, it is all meticulously rehearsed over and over again until it's perfect. Everyone else is perfect too. The supporting players pull their weight rather than slow things down. In the past the Marx boys played it sort of like they were in a different movie than everyone else. It's the same in Duck Soup, only this time everyone and everything just fits. And the final reel of the big bad war is the most rapid-fire marathon of Marx material I've ever seen. Naturally, I chose the film's climax as the clip to show for a presentation I did in my theatre history class about the Marx Bros. and their similarities to commedia dell'arte (it was way more fun than it sounds.) It comes down to this The Marx Brothers are all about chaos. Anything that is structured and in order, they come in and tear it apart. By the time they're done with Freedonia, all that's left is pure hilarious mayhem.And while you're out there risking life and limb through shot and shell, we'll be in here thinking what a sucker you are! DOUG It's the end of an era with this, the leanest and meanest Marx Brothers movie of all, and one that's very close to my heart, Duck Soup. It's the last one with Paramount, the last one with Zeppo, and the last one in the Pre-Code era. I watched this film for the first time several years ago on TCM. It was on at 1 in the morning, and it was the funniest 70 minutes of my life, totally worth it. Watching it this time, I kind of got this impression It's as though Zeppo got a role in this boring movie about two countries in political turmoil. Rather than simply act in the film as planned, he invited his brothers over to make things interesting. The result was Groucho, Chico, and Harpo disrupting the proceedings with their trademark mayhem and non-sequiters, while the other actors (Raquel Torres, Louis Calhern, and the great Margaret Dumont) are trying desperately to stick to the script. It's the only explanation for why Mrs. Teasdale ever trusts Firefly to save the nation, or why Trentino ever expects Chicolini and Pinky to come through for him. By the third act, it's as though they just threw out the script and made up the rest. The film's meager running time is filled to the brim with jokes, gags, and insults that come fast and furious; you'll never catch them all in one viewing, or two, or even three. Even 'Airplane' and 'Young Frankenstein' can't match the pace of this one. In one scene, Trentino asks the guys if they got Firefly's record, and a flurry of gags ensue a toss, a gunshot, a bell, a cigar, and finally trapped fingers. The only scene that doesn't really work for me is the trial scene, maybe because it feels like filler before the big finale, maybe we're all tired out by that point, or maybe it's just too many other characters stepping on the brothers' jokes and throwing out obvious set-ups. Then there's Zeppo, the youngest brother and straight man one last time, playing Groucho's handsome assistant Bob. I recall when I watched the film for the first time, I didn't know that Bob was actually Zeppo until he joins his brothers in the Freedonia's going to War number. Not that that's bad; he does what a straight man must, going along with his boss\/brother's every odd request (Here's five dollars, keep it under your hat. Never mind, I'll keep it under my hat.). Margaret Dumont is at her best here. She lets out the necessary reactions to Groucho's subtle insults about her weight, but never loses her cool, and powers on through in-character like nobody's business. Like comedies? Like mayhem? Like classic movies? Like good movies? Like movies AT ALL? SEE IT!Last film Little Women (1933). Next film Flying Down to Rio (1933).

This means WAR! First they messed with high society in Animal Crackers. Next they wrecked havoc on a cruise liner in Monkey Business. Then they unleashed their antics on the college campus in Horse Feathers. But this time, it's war! The Marx Brothers latest outing, Duck Soup is their funniest, most streamlined, and by far my favorite Marx movie, and it is the first movie on the odyssey that I already have memorized. I'll take this one over 'Night at the Opera' any day. The movie starts out like an achingly routine politics-and-manners play. But when Groucho makes his entrance, it's a non-stop romp from there. Margaret Dumont is at her best. In the previous films, her timing with Groucho was a little shaky. It would go like this Dumont would act regal, Groucho would toss out a non-sequiter, Dumont would pause to regain her bearings before the next line. Now the awkward pauses are gone, and Dumont never quits, no matter what Groucho says to her. My favorite moment from her is late in the film, when she puts in one last effort to prevent war and must watch helplessly as Groucho inevitably fouls it up. Edgar Slow Burn Kennedy is a stitch as the burly lemonade vendor who is repeatedly tormented by Chico and Harpo. After watching those scenes for the 18th time, I started to see that while certain comic beats may look chaotic, it is all meticulously rehearsed over and over again until it's perfect. Everyone else is perfect too. The supporting players pull their weight rather than slow things down. In the past the Marx boys played it sort of like they were in a different movie than everyone else. It's the same in Duck Soup, only this time everyone and everything just fits. And the final reel of the big bad war is the most rapid-fire marathon of Marx material I've ever seen. Naturally, I chose the film's climax as the clip to show for a presentation I did in my theatre history class about the Marx Bros. and their similarities to commedia dell'arte (it was way more fun than it sounds.) It comes down to this The Marx Brothers are all about chaos. Anything that is structured and in order, they come in and tear it apart. By the time they're done with Freedonia, all that's left is pure hilarious mayhem.And while you're out there risking life and limb through shot and shell, we'll be in here thinking what a sucker you are! DOUG It's the end of an era with this, the leanest and meanest Marx Brothers movie of all, and one that's very close to my heart, Duck Soup. It's the last one with Paramount, the last one with Zeppo, and the last one in the Pre-Code era. I watched this film for the first time several years ago on TCM. It was on at 1 in the morning, and it was the funniest 70 minutes of my life, totally worth it. Watching it this time, I kind of got this impression It's as though Zeppo got a role in this boring movie about two countries in political turmoil. Rather than simply act in the film as planned, he invited his brothers over to make things interesting. The result was Groucho, Chico, and Harpo disrupting the proceedings with their trademark mayhem and non-sequiters, while the other actors (Raquel Torres, Louis Calhern, and the great Margaret Dumont) are trying desperately to stick to the script. It's the only explanation for why Mrs. Teasdale ever trusts Firefly to save the nation, or why Trentino ever expects Chicolini and Pinky to come through for him. By the third act, it's as though they just threw out the script and made up the rest. The film's meager running time is filled to the brim with jokes, gags, and insults that come fast and furious; you'll never catch them all in one viewing, or two, or even three. Even 'Airplane' and 'Young Frankenstein' can't match the pace of this one. In one scene, Trentino asks the guys if they got Firefly's record, and a flurry of gags ensue a toss, a gunshot, a bell, a cigar, and finally trapped fingers. The only scene that doesn't really work for me is the trial scene, maybe because it feels like filler before the big finale, maybe we're all tired out by that point, or maybe it's just too many other characters stepping on the brothers' jokes and throwing out obvious set-ups. Then there's Zeppo, the youngest brother and straight man one last time, playing Groucho's handsome assistant Bob. I recall when I watched the film for the first time, I didn't know that Bob was actually Zeppo until he joins his brothers in the Freedonia's going to War number. Not that that's bad; he does what a straight man must, going along with his boss\/brother's every odd request (Here's five dollars, keep it under your hat. Never mind, I'll keep it under my hat.). Margaret Dumont is at her best here. She lets out the necessary reactions to Groucho's subtle insults about her weight, but never loses her cool, and powers on through in-character like nobody's business. Like comedies? Like mayhem? Like classic movies? Like good movies? Like movies AT ALL? SEE IT!Last film Little Women (1933). Next film Flying Down to Rio (1933).

Just how deeply ingrained this fear - this disease - is in the human mind is best illustrated by this Tarkovsky himself once said that most people leave the theater in silence after they'd finished watching Zerkalo. Tarkovsky must have said this with a touch of pride, hoping Zerkalo affected people deeply, emotionally, on a subconscious level, leaving them speechless and immersed in intellectual musing. However, the reality, as so often, is quite different from wishful thinking. Why did these people leave the theater in silence? Because they didn't DARE complain. Because they were utterly confused. Nearly everyone is afraid of not having understood the symbolism. Always keep in mind the vast majority of humanoids have a powerful FEAR of being exposed as morons or cowards in society. One of the many ways this can occur is by saying you didn't understand a movie. If you failed to understand Bambi, then you truly are a moron. On the other hand, by not admitting you were confused by pretentious European cinema you may think you have succeeded in hiding your supposed lack of intelligence, but all you've achieved is to show that you're a coward - unable to tear apart a movie like this with the frankness that it frankly deserves.I'm told this film is about a dying man, recouping his life, childhood, divorce... I've never even noticed that the narrator was dying! Where was this mentioned? (Perhaps I just dozed off&#133;) Unfortunately, the narration here is done through poetry, i.e. basic info is convoluted through riddles and other garbage, which basically means that Zerkalo becomes a puzzle to solve - like so many dumb European films - instead of a story to enjoy. Who says a movie has to be riddled with puzzles and symbolism in order to be artistically valid? Just exactly where is this written? I am not saying a film should spell everything out, i.e. require no amount of thought, but going to the other extreme can be just as stupid\/pointless. Zerkalo means almost nothing. The thin premise of a dying man and his reminiscing not only does not constitute a story, but is very DULL as well. I did not care about his life because his life was not nearly eventful and interesting enough to validate its being put on the big screen.So what does one get when poetry (i.e. rhythmic\/semantic puzzles) is layered on top of a bunch of meaningless, often unrelated scenes? You get a wonderful stew of nonsense, leaving the viewer free to interpret it IN ANY WAY he chooses. Whatever meaning you find in this malarkey is totally individual, and can be easily supported by a plethora of invented arguments. It's like a Picasso painting abstract enough crap to elicit any kind of meaning. Picasso and Tarkovsky's Zerkalo have that one thing in common both are feared greatly by people who lack the guts to admit to others (and sometimes even to themselves!) that they do not understand it. (Besides, what's there to understand?) Whenever a movie requires a road map, you know it has failed - at least in the story department. What does all that documentary footage mean? Tarkovsky pretentiously shoves various newsreels into Ogledalo, most probably because he likes the way they look. Maybe HE saw a meaning, i.e. a link between those scenes and the story, but I believe that movies can be approached as food in restaurants the customer is always right. Or at least the director ISN'T always right. Tarkovsky can talk about how all the scenes here have a purpose until he's blue in the face, and I still won't take him seriously. It isn't difficult to link the unlinkable all you need is some imagination and an even healthier amount of self-delusion. What Tarkovsky and Zerkalo's fans see in this film will only make sense in their confused, deluded, hallucinatory little minds. On the other hand, Ogledalce has some very good photography, especially the scenes in colour. The documentary footage, if nothing, is a welcome refreshment amidst all the confusing nonsense, some of which is quite dull, as well.Symbolism? A man holding a bird in his hand, while the narrator emits incomprehensible poetry at the poor viewer? Yeah, the bird symbolizes life, whatever. The stuttering boy from the first scene probably symbolizes the difficulty of communication in society. Whatever. There is a problem with communication amongst humans?? Really??? Why, thank you, Mr.Tarkovsky, for letting us in on that great secret! I never, EVER, would have realized this were it not for Zerkalo. The point I'm making is that below all these clouds of verbal and visual riddles, there often hides a message (IF there is one) that is banal, anything but deep.

The film is mainly set around a school and this is hilarious as all the actors clearly left school years before the filming of this movie took place! Despite the numerous problems (which would only really be problems in a serious film), Switchblade Sisters is still an awesome trash flick as it's just so much fun to watch. There's always plenty going on in the film, most of the lead characters are very amusing and the liberal attitude to violence that is displayed makes for great entertainment.

You never really know where the film is going, though that's more down to the fact that it just seems to do whatever it feels like without following a logical progression; although to the film's credit, this does work rather well. I wasn't surprised to find that most of the main player's didn't make much else aside from this film (Monica Gayle being the only exception) and most of them fail to convince with their performances - though again, it's actually to the film's credit as it helps to instill the Grindhouse style. The film is mainly set around a school and this is hilarious as all the actors clearly left school years before the filming of this movie took place! Despite the numerous problems (which would only really be problems in a serious film), Switchblade Sisters is still an awesome trash flick as it's just so much fun to watch.

The film will likely get compared with later but better known gang flick 'The Warriors' and I suppose you could determine Switchblade Sisters to be the female version of Walter Hill's classic exploitation film. But just because it focuses on the fairer sex, don't let that fool you into thinking that Switchblade Sisters doesn't have its own nasty edge; as while you cant really take this film seriously, there's certainly plenty to please exploitation fans. The plot actually has more layers to it than you might expect considering the type of film but the main focus is on a gang named 'The Dagger Debs'. The Debs are controlled by Dominic; the leader of 'The Silver Daggers'.

The result is a fairly competent Stephen King adaptation of a big, friendly pooch that is somewhat innocently turned into a bloodthirsty devil dog.One frolicky afternoon in the sunshine, the title farm dog is pursuing a scampering bunny rabbit through the countryside. Mistakenly popping his head into what he thinks is Thumper's underground domicile, is instead infested with bats. One pierces poor Cujo's schnozz and days later, the chaos begins.On the other side of town, more mundane things are being played out. Your average three-person family --- complete with a kid who fears his closet at bedtime --- are going through the motions. Sure, we wouldn't mind a little character development and subtext for what's to come, but it's this part of the screenplay that nearly kills the film. Completely needless subplots populate this thing like no tomorrow, involving extra-marital activities, the most average town stud of the 80s, and an asinine attempt at damage control for --- you ready? --- a cereal campaign that's made America physically ill. What any of this crap is doing in a horror film is beyond me.But once you've slogged through that superfluous nonsense, you're permitted a decent little thriller. We observe a mother and her young son damned by a 70s eyesore Pinto which malfunctions at exactly the wrong time. What neighborhood farm does is crap out at? You guessed it. The residence of the now bloodsoaked, dirtied Cujo.Director Teague ought to be commended for keeping the action so tense in what ends up being (basically) a one location film. A supremely trained movie dog (or possibly *dogs*) evoke genuine fear and panic for the audience. And Teague as well creates a perfect sense of isolation for the desolate setting, which in many King novels, is a character in itself. Jan de Bont's cinematography is superbly skilled as well, most impressively involving a steadicam shot approaching the open door of the Pinto. And an excellent one rotating around Cujo as he sits on the porch of the house, the car in his sights.Wallace and Pintauro carry the film quite well, though Pintauro's screechy whining can be a bit much at times. But that's what it makes it so convincing! You feel a legitimate observation is going of how these two people would cope with being held hostage by a serial mutt. Other characters seem to occupy the screen for the sole purpose of distancing themselves from the audience, so when they're attacked, we feel better about it. And the bearded lathario who allegedly has several mistresses at his disposal, still sees it necessary to take a knife to one of his conquests homes out of her rejection of him. Please.The close of the film leaves an important visual off-screen (lemme just say gunshot!), and the final frame (especially the music) is right out of a soap opera. And I'm sorry, but as a dog lover, there were just times that I actually had sympathy for Cujo. He's not inherently evil to begin with, and most notably in the beginning, is viewed as a fluffy, friendly canine. So to see him descend into a killing machine was almost a bit depressing at times.But if you can power through a fodder-laden start (or even utilize the fast forward button), Cujo is a passable scare-fest for a Friday night with friends.

Naturally things outside of the race start to take over priorities, they get mixed up in a diamond robbery and Herbie falls in love with another car!. The car stunts are of course pleasant and easy on the eye, and it would be churlish of me to really vent venom on such a friendly piece of fluff, it's just that the film goes nowhere fast and personally now i can see it for the coin motivated piece of work it is. Still you get to see Herbie take a bath, foil the baddies and of course dance for the lady in his life, so something there for everyone i think....................4\/10.

Along the way she would also get an Oscar for best supporting actress in Separate Tables. She would still be appearing in television and movies up to the end. Never a really pretty woman (her supporting co-star in Major Barbara, Deborah Kerr, actually was far better looking - and would have more romantic roles), Hiller ended in pretty rich character parts. Example her Russian Gramd Duchess in Murder On The Orient Express. The real exception to her lack of a romantic lead role is not 'Liza Doolittle in Pygmalion. It is Joan Webster in the Powell and Pressburger film I Know Where I'M Going. She is a lively and intelligent woman, but fairly ordinary looking. Which may explain why her romantic partner in this film is Roger Livesey (as Torquil Macneil). Livesey is a distinguished actor too, but hardly a handsome man. The two balance very nicely.Joan, we are told, was alway assured about how to manage her life from the age of ten. She intended from her youth to marry well (i.e., a man of wealth and position). And we learn that she is now headed for the Hebrides in northern Scotland. Her fiancé is a wealthy man building a mansion on an island up there. He plans to marry her in the mansion. It seems a reasonable set up, until Joan reaches the one port across the narrow seas (about fifteen miles) from the island. It seems the seas are quite rough, and the weather is not calming down yet. It would be suicidal to take a small row boat across the sea in this weather. Joan is flummoxed by this, as she had no plans to spend much time in the seaport.What follows is the slow re-education of Joan. Firstly she finds her admiration for her rich boyfriend is not universal. Most of the locals think of him as a stranger or a fool (one can't imagine why he wants a swimming pool on his island mansion - he has the entire ocean around him to swim in!). Then she discovers that these common people have lives of interest and intensity of their own. And the person who is awakening her to this slow realization is Torquil. A local Laird, he has much personal interaction with the people, who give him their respect and affection, but he is (like many nobles) land poor (he has some land, but no money). Torquil is capable of lecturing Joan (when she still tries to get to that island if she can get one of the locals risk it), berating her for risking the lives of some others by promises of money they need. But he also keeps showing the small joys of the locals, such as their dances and anniversaries. He also shows her the ruins of the ancient kingdom of Scotland, including a tower where a lovers' tragedy occurred in the far distant past. And slowly Joan begins to realize that perhaps she should look at less pragmatic reasons to marry.I Know Where I'm Going is not as well remembered as later Powell and Pressburger films like A Matter Of Life And Death (Stairway To Heaven), Black Narcissus (in my opinion their masterpiece), or The Red Shoes.

But he's too much the European rationalist, I gather, to get in touch with that inner being that only reveals itself through dreams.Darkly original mystery heavy on the metaphysics from director-writer Peter Weir. Already he had proved his skill at flirting with other dimensions in Picnic at Hanging Rock (1975). Here it's the arcane world of the Australian Aborigines that confronts that the tightly ordered world of the predominant whites. Something strange is going on inside the Aborigine community when they kill one of their number for no apparent reason. Yuppie lawyer Chamberlain is supposed to defend them in a white man's court. But the more he looks into things, the more mysterious things get, and the more interested a strange old Aboriginal man gets in him. And then there're those scary dreams that come and go at odd times.Well structured screenplay deepens interest throughout. One reason the movie works is the background normalcy of Chamberlain's wife and little daughters. Audiences can readily identify with them. And when their little world runs into forces beyond the usual framework, the normalcy begins to buckle, and we get the feeling of worlds beginning to collide. Chamberlain underplays throughout, especially during the underground discovery tour where I think he should have shown more growing awareness than he does. After all, it's the picking up of the mask that holds the key (I believe) to the riddle, yet his reaction doesn't really register the revelation. Of course, the notion of nature striking back has a certain resonance now, thirty years later. In the film, the notion is wrapped in a lot of entertaining hocus-pocus, but the subject itself remains a telling one. One way of bringing out a central irony is the symbolism of the opening scene. A big white SUV barrels past an aboriginal family, leaving them in the historical dust. The terrain looks like an interior tribal reservation of no particular importance to the coastal fleshpots where industry dwells.

The film is based on a 30 page short story King published in his 'Night Shift' anthology. The story revolves around the town of Gatlin, Nebraska, where the children have formed a cult worshiping a deity who lives among the cornfields. As a result, the children have all been driven to murder every adult in town at the whim of Isaac (John Franklin), the leader of the children and the one who acts as a prophet for the corn-god. Linda Hamilton and Peter Horton play a couple who stumble across the desolate, cursed town.The story itself plays out nicely, but since it is adapted from a mere 30 pages, George Goldsmith must have had his hands full drawing it out to last 90 minutes. It does tend to slow down a bit in the first and second acts and I was left wishing something would happen to advance the story. There's a long period where we follow Burton (Horton) and Vicky (Hamilton) as they wander around searching for a phone. Once the third act kicks in, the pace quickens and I was drawn back into the story.Surprisingly enough, for a movie where the bulk of the cast is child actors, the performances weren't that bad. It's not often that I see decent acting out of children (I still resent Jake Lloyd for his performance as Anakin Skywalker). John Franklin did a great job as the demented corn-god prophet, giving a stern performance without going too over-the-top. Courtney Gains seemed to ham it up a bit as Malachai, Isaac's enforcer, but it was never annoying. For some reason, the kid kind of reminded me of Hugo Weaving at some points...The real weak spot for the film is it's CGI. Keep in mind, the film only had a 3 million dollar budget. So, while the CGI seemed weak (even by 1984 standards), it was the best they could do on their budget. The corn-god's final wrath-fest looked like something out of an OLD arcade game and weakened the overall effect of it all.

Big ideas walked right alongside trite ones, constantly bringing the picture down. Entirely too much time was spent on the opening sequence, and other pacing issues bog the film down. Unexpected plot surprises kept piquing my interest, only to disappear in completely predictable good guy\/bad guy set-ups.

It's distracting and downright silly at times.As high on my wish list never ever ever cast a non-musician in a musician's role. The poor woman trying to play the diva was utterly ridiculous in her attempt to look like she was producing the exquisite tones coming out of her mouth. In addition, for all the hype about the diva, it was only a letdown when the makeup and costuming effects were so-so and her phenomenal voice was augmented, not by incredible and imaginative visuals, but by silly hand movements and very un-diva-like she-bopping.The sets were eye-poppingly real and then suddenly cartoonish. Big ideas walked right alongside trite ones, constantly bringing the picture down. Entirely too much time was spent on the opening sequence, and other pacing issues bog the film down. Unexpected plot surprises kept piquing my interest, only to disappear in completely predictable good guy\/bad guy set-ups. Please, someone, remake this film with a coherent message and the ability to make it all hang together.

There is so much potential here that it's positively maddening to see it wasted.The actors do a wonderful job overall, though Gary Oldman is so comic book character that it's almost embarrassing.

The late 50s and early 60s saw Melville's Bob le Flambeur, Topkapi, the early Pink Panther movies, and this fine neo-realist\/comic effort from Monicelli, a director I've not heretofore been familiar with.It's a rather odd film, with many shifts in tone and a rambling plot that really doesn't coalesce into anything approaching the crime story you might expect until about halfway through. A group of small-time crooks and ex-cons, among them Peppe (Vittorio Gassman), Dante (Toto), and Tiberio (Marcello Mastroianni) hit upon a plan to rob a pawnbroker's safe by going through the wall of a neighboring apartment while the tenants are away; but they are clearly so incompetent and half-hearted about the whole thing that we never really believe they're going to get anywhere with their plans. The real drama to the story lies in wondering just when and how they'll get caught and who will go to jail; the real miracle will be if they get away without losing anything, let alone winning through.It's a portrait of a still desperately poor Italy just a few years after the war....there are still old, war-torn, decrepit buildings everywhere and the new ones we see going up are as ugly as anything being built in Poland at the time....everybody seems to know someone in prison or be a parolee him\/herself.....so the comedy has a sombre edge to it, despite the presence of the farcical Toto, and the young and garrulous Mastroianni. Look for a very young Claudia Cardinale in a small role as well. Beautifully shot in a low-rent way in B\/W by Gianni di Venanzo.
