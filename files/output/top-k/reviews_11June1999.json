[{"date":"11 June 1999","score":"","review":"  Yeh, I expected the movie to be a bit on the horror and action side after watching the preview, but that doesn't mean I was disappointed! Well, this movie gave me a break from a computer-generated nonsence of recent releases.Although I didn't agree with the ideas, it certanly made me think and even re-establish my views on some ideas. Anthony Hopkins is brilliant. He squeezes the best out of each scene. But I can't say the same about Cuba Gooding Jr. Honestly, I think that his character was a carbon copy of the one he played in As good as it gets  same tone of voice, same looks, same moves! This was rather disappointing. The plot was well-developed, although I didn't find anything original in it. Same old idea of living in perfect harmony with Mother Nature. Come on, this movie doesn't really contribute anything to a good old couch-philosophy. Alongside with some corny lines (humans are takers, etc.) and a badly done ending, this movie does have its share of good moments, and keeps you in suspense until the very end. In short, it's a situation when not too strong a plot is being balanced by great acting.
