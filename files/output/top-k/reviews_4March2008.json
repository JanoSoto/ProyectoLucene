This formula in teen movies has been played over and over again, so why waste your time watching another one? What makes this movie different from others of this genre are the actors and seeing them perform roles that they have never done before and somehow pulling it off. First, we have Ben Foster, a name that immediately makes you think of all the socially awkward rejects and enraged psychos that he has played during his short career. Here, he gets to play a different role as the clueless basketball jock Berke Landers, who is desperately trying to win back his sexy ex-girlfriend Allison McAllister by entering into the school theatre production that she has chosen to take part in. Although a skeptical casting choice, Foster pulls off the role with the right amount of finesse, making Berke cool enough to see why a stunning beauty like Allison would fall for him while at the same time making him not so cool so we understand why Allison might have gotten bored with him (something teen idol Freddie Prinze, Jr. would have a hard time doing). With his right combination of average good looks, low-key charisma, and competitive attitude, Foster ultimately convinced me as the lovestruck teen protagonist.Another against type performance is given by Kirsten Dunst. She plays Kelly Woods, the younger sister of Berke's best friend Felix, who is desperately trying to get the attention of Berke, who is too busy trying to woo his ex. Usually playing the sought-after, popular teen queen, Kirsten Dunst is now the under-appreciated, unnoticed girl, despite her everpresent attractiveness both on the outside and inside. Dunst gets to downplay her engaging screen presence in order to allow love object Foster to be the focus of the film and does so successfully.In addition to the two leads, we have Colin Hanks, whose nerdy and studious characters in Roswell and Orange County are forgotten by his performance here as party animal and fellow jock Felix Woods, who is both helping Berke forget about Allison and keeping other guys from hitting on his kid sister. Hanks provides a lot of the comedy, channeling some of his father's zany comedic appeal from the early part of his career in the 1980s.Meanwhile, we have Shane West and Sisqo playing away from their usual entertainment personas. Niceguy Shane West of Once and Again and Whatever It Takes plays the teen villain as Bentley Striker Scrumfeld, the British heartthrob and school's new theatre buff who dazzles his way into Allison's fancies. Singer Sisqo, who is known for his sexually-charged dance performances and seductive R&B lyrical vocals, plays the timid Dennis Wallace, another friend of Berke and basketball star trying to muster up the courage to ask out Kelly's friend Basin, played surprisingly sweet by Mila Kunis, an actress known for playing less friendly characters on screen. Added to the mix are Berke's hilariously liberal parents, played with comic delight by serious, dramatic actors Ed Begley, Jr. and Swoosie Kurtz.The only other main character not cast against type is Dr. Desmond Forrest Oates, the egocentric drama coach trying to keep the play from being a total disaster. Dr. Oates is played unsurprisingly over-the-top by Martin Short, but unlike in most of his comedies, I found Short to be quite funny here.Don't expect anything new or surprising in the storyline and don't expect the jokes to be too original, but do expect to be surprised by the actors playing the roles and enjoy their performances. If you follow this formula, you are in for a quite a treat.

A splice of genres from director Richard Donner backed up by two central performances from two of the biggest names of the 90s. I think the overriding thing I take from the film is the story itself, it's whole conspiracy theme and dark shadowy shenanigans make the film never less than interesting and it compels you to stay with it no matter what contrivances come your way.Starting out with a first reel leading you to believe that it's a comedy first and foremost the film then shifts to such a high gear it kind of submarines you to the point that you feel you have to rewind to see if you are not watching a double bill !, the pace is up and down and twists pop up at set point markers, but it works well because the story is an engrossing one and I feel Donner has done pretty much a perfect job with the material at hand.Julia Roberts is a safe choice as Alice Sutton, the role calls for a safe approach, say your lines with credibility and feed off the leading man, she does this with no problems at all, but she really is playing second fiddle to Mel Gibson's ball of energy performance as main protagonist Jerry Fletcher, it's a twitchy and potent turn from Gibson that I feel is vastly under praised in view of his career output. The supporting cast do not fare so well with Patrick Stewart particularly robotic as the..... is he the bad guy, isn't he the bad guy role, but the film culminates with a good ending to seal the deal and I really think this film is one that will get better with further viewings, 7\/10.

The humor is very clever and mature (compared to say, a Will Farrell style college movie). I love the narration by the Eddy character, it makes this movie so much more. He makes you really feel what he's feeling. All three characters take you on their journey of self discovery, a bit of sexual experimentation that often occurs while in college, and most of all - the painful truth about How can someone be such a necessary part of one's life one moment, and simply vanish the next? How true is that?! One should also note the amazing original score by Thomas Newman. He's composed music for a ton of other movies too such as American Beauty, Pay It Forward, Erin Brockovich - just to scratch the surface. I recently became obsessed with finding this music, that is NOT included on the Threesome soundtrack (although the non-original music on that CD is a great compilation, including U2's Dancing Barefoot - a phenomenal song). I found it just this week if anyone else has been going crazy trying to find this music. It's on the American Buffalo soundtrack. The first half of the CD the score for American Buffalo score (which is pretty mediocre), and the last half is the original score to Threesome! Anyway, I think all three characters are VERY well played by the actors, even Stephen Baldwin - although I'm sure the role of the obnoxious, sex-obsessed roommate was tailor-made for the guy at that time. I love his and all the characters, and wouldn't change a thing about how they contribute to the three-way relationship that's formed as well as the story line.This movie is also very believable, a quality I love and a quality that keeps me from watching overly melodramatic classics like Gone With the Wind. I just don't believe the characters in those types of movies! So if you saw Threesome before and only thought it was so-so, give it another chance. Try to see it with new eyes, and for the love of God, listen to the original music when you can catch it. If you haven't seen it, rent it. You'll be pleasantly surprised. The DVD offers a couple of alternate endings, but I like the one they ultimately chose best. So it's not the happiest of endings, it's an extremely realistic ending. I was left completely satisfied.

Round about the time this was released on DVD i lost my mum to cancer. This was the last film I watched with her so nowadays it has sentimental value. This is a perfect film to watch if you're depressed as it does make you feel better after you watch it. This is my fave movie ever. I watch this nearly every month because I love the movie so much. This cannot be repeated twice, there can't be a sequel to it, It's a golden tear film (meaning weepie) The power that this film has is unbelievable. If you have lost a loved one then you'd know the power that i'm talking about. The acting is superb. Patrick really does make you believe in this character and this nightmare he is going through and by the end you really do feel the magic that the character goes through. It does really make you wonder what that life beyond death is really like. The romantic side of this film doesn't miss a beat. Patrick and Demi's chemistry is paramount to the story and it doesn't feel faked, it feels real. The inclusion of Whoopi Goldberg's character gives it a lighthearted style humour which by the end has a message to it. Jerry Zucker who recent flicks before this one were Airplane! does a great job mixing the heartfelt sentimentality with the stand out humour that you get when Patrick and Whoopi are together on screen. Whoopi quite rightly deserved that Oscar she got for this role. Her acting was brilliant. Two cast members has been outlooked by every one but without there characters this movie might not have worked. I'm talking about of course Tony Goldwyn as Karl and Rick Aviles as Willie. The subtle acting brings out their most evil side and you are genuinely shocked when you found out he was in on it the whole time. How could you allow your best friend to be murdered? You feel that their just desserts are quite literally deserved after how you see them as and what they had done to Sam. It is scary in some parts and even a little gruesome but the message does still shine through. Love is forever if you believe. By the end yes even i was in floods of tears. That is the power that this one has, to literally bring you to tears. No matter how hard you try, it will always do that. I have watched this time and time again and I still cry buckets at the end, even before the scene even starts, I'm already filling up. The end scene is the standout moment of the film. It is the magic of GHOST. There is no more powerful word than goodbye. Industrial Light and Magic create an effect that pulls at the heartstrings and the acting from the stars pulls even more. The real magic of this scene is Maurice Jarre's powerful soft instrumental theme of Unchained Melody. The soft violins lets the tears flow. It is truly beautiful. Even right now i'm thinking of it and i'm getting a lump in my throat. If you haven't seen this yet, see it now. If you want a great tearjerker, they don't come better than this.

I think that this film did a great job, and in spite of it not standing out at the box office, it rivals many of the better movies in many genres -- not just comedies.One of the main things that made this movie great is that it was taken very seriously. Often the approach to comedy is an approach that has been used for years, in about everything comedic. Basically the performance is merely a platform for jokes. For small scale performances, you have a small stage & perhaps a few props. For a slightly larger scale, you might have bigger, low-budget sets. The point is usually to make the audience laugh. Hopefully, you can keep the laughs going, so the audience doesn't turn the TV off or leave the theater. On the movie scale, a humorous movie is usually written, so that all the gags that have been chosen can be showcased in the alloted time. Usually it seems, from the viewer's standpoint, that the script\/story is then written after the gags are chosen. The jokes & gags are inserted at the appropriate points.The thing that separates this movie is there is actually a good story behind the whole thing. Of course, the story isn't new. Such a story has been a topic of fan-fiction for ages. A writer will often try to find a way to insert his or herself into the story somehow. It is also natural for us as human beings to identify with actors that suddenly become part of something bigger. In some ways, you can see the problem of the traditional approach to comedy. Tim Allen delivers some of his typically funny lines full of malapropisms. In some ways, it's hard to believe that a normal person would be oblivious enough to so badly misunderstand conversations. This affects believability, but it's forgivable & minor. Most movies rely on extreme humorous dialog & slapstick to entirely float the movie. Instead, Tim Allen transforms into a believable and formidable commander, that many sci-fi movies might be proud to have in charge. Even though the movie had far-fetched concepts in it, the concepts were presented in a way that it was perfectly believable -- more believable than more serious sci-fi movies.Without getting too technical & taking itself too seriously, yet still giving credit to the audience for grasping complex concepts, I think that Galaxy Quest delivers a very entertaining & well balanced movie. It was a complete and entertaining movie with a good story, and not just skits pieced together.

Instead, Tim Allen transforms into a believable and formidable commander, that many sci-fi movies might be proud to have in charge. Even though the movie had far-fetched concepts in it, the concepts were presented in a way that it was perfectly believable -- more believable than more serious sci-fi movies.Without getting too technical & taking itself too seriously, yet still giving credit to the audience for grasping complex concepts, I think that Galaxy Quest delivers a very entertaining & well balanced movie.

When I first read the reviews here, there were far less. In addition, it is somewhat rare to find any friends that have really appreciated this film. I think that this film did a great job, and in spite of it not standing out at the box office, it rivals many of the better movies in many genres -- not just comedies.One of the main things that made this movie great is that it was taken very seriously. Often the approach to comedy is an approach that has been used for years, in about everything comedic. Basically the performance is merely a platform for jokes. For small scale performances, you have a small stage & perhaps a few props. For a slightly larger scale, you might have bigger, low-budget sets. The point is usually to make the audience laugh. Hopefully, you can keep the laughs going, so the audience doesn't turn the TV off or leave the theater. On the movie scale, a humorous movie is usually written, so that all the gags that have been chosen can be showcased in the alloted time. Usually it seems, from the viewer's standpoint, that the script\/story is then written after the gags are chosen. The jokes & gags are inserted at the appropriate points.The thing that separates this movie is there is actually a good story behind the whole thing. Of course, the story isn't new. Such a story has been a topic of fan-fiction for ages. A writer will often try to find a way to insert his or herself into the story somehow. It is also natural for us as human beings to identify with actors that suddenly become part of something bigger. In some ways, you can see the problem of the traditional approach to comedy.

There are many other movies of lesser quality getting 7 or more stars.Now to be honest, my memory of the specifics of this movie are a little vague and I don't criticize movies for being too sappy or for things like rehashing themes that others have done. I figure if the movie can make me laugh and cry all in the same movie, it is a great movie. I think this one did.I find movies like this superior to say a Tarentino movie or a movie full of special effects. I want a movie to SAY something. I want it to touch me deeply, and not just get a cheap rise out of me. This is just such a movie.Although I agree with one other review that compared it favorably to Crash, for me it isn't about the end being positive per se. I just didn't think Crash quite spoke the kind of truth this movie did. One of my favorite rock albums of all time is Pink Floyd's The Wall which is very dark in its message. I only listen to it once in a while because I don't like to dwell on the negative -- Crash could have been on a par - unfortunately, I can't put my finger on the reason, but it didn't achieve that level of truth for me.Long story short...

A very smart and astute film that's knowing of the times a changing, and featuring a dynamic Female duo to rank with the best that cinema has to offer. 7\/10 ","genre":"Comedy, Musical, Romance"},{"date":"4 March 2008","score":"4 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":" Other than Ridley Scott's brilliant Thelma And Louise 1991, Gentlemen Prefer Blondes has to rank as one of the finest films where the girls actually out buddy buddy the men!!It would seem that a chief complaint with the film is that it has no similarity to Anita Loo's Broadway musical? And whilst I'm one for pounding on films for missing out crucial parts of source novels, I have no frame of reference as regards this film's original source so therefore view with untainted eyes as it were.Watched this last night and grinned throughout with the cheek of it all, I mean it really shouldn't work because on the face of it it is just a couple of showgirls taking a trip, but the blatant use of stereotypes for these two ladies is very funny indeed. Monroe is absolutely perfect for the role of Lorelei, a woman purely out for the sparkle of diamonds and a man's bank balance, she is as much shallow as she is to die for gorgeous. Jane Russell is sublime here, her Dorothy Shaw is witty and sophisticated and very protective towards her friend, yet she also needs to be loved and this shines out amongst the sarcasm and sharpness of her tongue.The film works to me on more than one level, it works as a sugar and sweet musical with glamour girls to feast my eyes upon, but it also works as a sharp piece of work when taking into account the time it was made. The 50s my research and my parents lead me to believe were very much the time of family values being paramount, yet around the time of this film's release, sex was becoming more of a topic to the people of the street.

It is perfect cinema from a golden age that we rarely see in this day and age. During a rich peoples socialite scavenger hunt, air head Irene Bullock wins the contest to see who can find a forgotten man, a hobo, and showcase him at the toffs party. She falls for the charisma of down and out Godfrey Parke and gives him the job of Butler to the family Bullock, this of course bemuses the family, even more so when Godfrey turns out to be far more than they originally thought.My Man Godfrey is one of those old classic comedies that has satire at its heart, here the rich are firmly in the target sights of the makers, for it's they who come across as bumbling buffoons, whilst Godfrey the hobo is the one with tact and grace, he is the one they all should take their markers from. Yet as important as the social message is here, it's the brilliant comedy that comes to the fore, this is an electric script benefiting from great work from all involved. William Powell is Godfrey, it's a perfect performance as he is never flustered yet delivering funny lines with caustic impact. Carole Lombard is just precious as the dopey love sick Irene, her interplay with Powell is comedy gold. My favourite of the bunch tho is Eugene Palette as Alexander, the father of this bizarro family, every mannerism and every line out of his mouth had me in stitches. I must also mention that of the 6 Oscars the film was nominated for, I'm stunned there wasn't one for Gail Patrick as Cornelia, it's devilishly icy and weasel like, and she impacted hard on me to the point that I wanted to strangle her, a great performance from her.Truth is, they are all great, from the actors to the director, from the editor to the writer, My Man Godfrey is a truly brilliant film that easily entered my top 100 greatest films list today. 10\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"4 March 2008","score":"56 out of 60 people found the following review useful","review":" If I was the sort of person who scrutinised every frame of my viewings looking for flaws, then I still wouldn't have issue here because My Man Godfrey has no cracks in its make up.

Zellweger is cute and vivacious. It was quite fun to watch Chris Cooper play the villain. the rest of the cast (which is a lot) contribute well.
