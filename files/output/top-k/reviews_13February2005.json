[{"date":"13 February 2005","score":"3 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" The Simpsons has been one of my favorite TV shows, and for the same reason that I like the Simpsons is what makes Shrek so good. The Simpsons takes the children-only medium of cartoons and makes an adult show out of it, with jokes in it that only adults will find amusing, some for adult eyes' only. Shrek is animation, a beautiful computer animation that looks realistic and bold, has enough kiddy humor in it to make the kids like it, but has even more jokes that adults will love. It's the cross between childhood innocence and adult knowledge that brings Shrek so many laughs. Mike Myers supplies the voice of Shrek, an ogre who enjoys living by himself in his swamp on the outskirt of Duloc, a near-perfect kingdom ran by the insecure Lord Farquaad, voice with wonderful swarmy-ness by John Lithgow. When Farquaad begins to deposit all of the mythical creatures that populate his kingdom into Shrek's swamp, Shrek demands to see the king, and only the smart-ass Donkey knows the way. Donkey is a sassy talking, well, donkey, voiced by Eddie Murphy and is the Lou Costello to Shrek's Bud Abbot--to say Shrek is the straight man in this odd couple is an understatement. After meeting the king, Shrek and Donkey then have a quest of finding Fraquaad Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz), an imprisoned lady guarded by a dragon. I personally would have gone with Snow White, but to each their own. What also sets Shrek apart from other animated movies is the music, mostly rock music, mostly from Smashmouth. I do not think a Disney picture would have made the same selections. It gives it a different feel from the usual animated fare, Shrek for sure has it's own identity. Getting back to the animation, the computer generated scenery and characters are great to look at, very lifelike, even the human beings. Pixar, who has made films such as Toy Story and Finding Nemo, has made it clear that human beings are the most difficult objects to animate on computers, but I think DreamWorks got it right in Shrek--there is nothing there that makes me say that does not look right. There are great in-jokes about the world of childhood stories, while sprinkling in some very adult humor. The best sight gags for me revolve around Farquaad interrogating a gingerbread man and threatening a magic mirror. Shrek will entertain and amuse the young and old alike.

The loony comedy troupe that made the popular BBC television show Monty Python's Flying Circus which featured silly sketches that often didn't end, the famous animation style that looks more like South Park than The Simpsons, and humor that drew as much from 1960s British current events as it did from the Middle Ages. Monty Python was Dennis Miller before Dennis Miller was out of his diapers. All of these influences on their humor come through in their most complete movie, a retelling of the King Arthur legends and lore. And when I say retelling, I mean a series of sketches that have their root in Middle Ages lore and have some affiliation with King Arthur. Methinks the Knights Who Say Ni did not exist in the late 900s. Graham Chapman plays King Arthur, who does not ride a horse, but rather simulates a horse by banging two coconuts together, as he tours the English countryside, trying to find knights for his round table at Camelot. The knights never do make it to Camelot, as Arthur claims it is a rather silly place, instead are met by God and told of their quest. The movie then follows each knight as they meet snooty Frenchmen (notably John Cleese and his flying barnyard animals), the Castle Anthrax and the 18-22 year old women who make scandalous underwear, the three-headed knight, and many other odd creatures. My favorite tale is that of Sir Lancelot (again, Cleese) as he tries to save someone from being forced to be married by their father. After taking out the entire wedding party, Lancelot finds Prince Herbert (Terry Jones) and silliness ensues. In true Monty Python fashion, the last scene of the movie does not really fit in with the rest of the movie, but if you know Python, you know it is the right ending of the movie. Fantastic points about society are sprinkled in throughout the movie, jokes about overacting are accentuated by the phrase Get on with it! as shouted by other characters in the movie, and we even get to learn some Swedish. Directed by Terry Jones and Terry Gilliam, it is a fast paced onslaught of scatological jokes, and shrubbery.

This film is loved by many people, but it is easily underestimated, specially by those who want films to give them deep philosophical lessons and impressive point of views of our society. A film doesn't need to be deep to be a masterpiece, if Amelie would try to be more deep than it already is it would ultimately become a worse movie, this movie is not about taking things seriously, this film is about giving people an experience, a pure cinematic experience and it does such a rare thing as having the vast maiority of people who went to see this in the theater leave the theater more happy than when they entered. It is such a powerful experience many couldn't stop smiling for a week walking around in the streets thinking about the film and looking like a fool! I am quite sure this has never happened in the same collective way to any other movie than Amelie......in movie history! That is why this film is unique, that is why this film changes the life of people like the tagline says. It is because it enters straight to the hearth of people and people begin to ask themselves about their own reality and why they can't feel the same way in our universe as in Amelie's universe. A film doesn't need deep messages about humanity to change the way we see life, love, humanity...This is such a simple, universal film everyone can understand. The movie is perfect in every way and it is quite wonderful the way things worked out. Because I am quite sure the director alone couldn't make this movie, how good the direction might be I think there are 2 other factors almost as important, Audrey Tautou and Yann Tiersen. From the beginning Emily Watson was supposed to play Amelie, before she became pregnant. Watson is a great actress but never do I think it would have worked, mainly because Tautou IS Amelie in this movie and Amelie is FRENCH, Watson is not. The angelic Amelie has since become almost a symbol for France and tourists visits the cafe and makes Amelie tours around the city, the prize of the apartments in the neighborhood has sky-rocketed thanks to this movie! Yann Tiersen is also extremely important. Originally Jeunet had someone else working for the movie, but one time he heard one of Yann Tiersen's songs in his car and fast he ran to buy all albums from Yann Tiersen and decided he should make the music for the film. Yann Tiersen had anyway only 15 days to make music for the film and said he didn't have time, Jeunet proposed he could include some of Yann's old songs into the movie and the result was 9 old and 9 new absolutely wonderful, heavenly beautiful tracks all completely perfect for this film. Nostalgic, happy, sad, energetic tracks who together with the cinematography set the right mood for the film.Another great thing about this movie are the colors, always mixing between strong red and green colors which makes you feel you are in a world which only could exist in your dreams, the most beautiful ones you ever had. You could go on about everything which is perfect in this movie, the simple odd characters you so easily feel sympathy for and they are presented in a way only Jeunet could present a character. The odd Jeunet humor we have seen before in Delicatessen and City of the lost children, a humor which only exists in his universe. The simple plot is effective and right not to be more complicated than it needs to be and it has a beautiful message we don't often see in movies generosity. There is also romance in this movie, but no relationship dramas, dialog, grand romantic scenes ala Titanic. No, this romantic trip is as beautiful and simple as our best memories about love and happiness.Everything in the movie represents the best things about life, love and France. Yes, it is so french and it is so good in being french that you feel like you are french or at least wants to be sometimes when you are watching this film. Everything from Montmarte (a character in its own in the movie), Audrey Tautou to Yann Tiersen is so french, maybe I should add it is a beautiful, positive point of view of french culture without being idealistic (all people have many problems and no one has a perfect life), never becoming uninteresting or boring. I hope only those who have seen the film reads this, because I don't want people to get over-hyped about this movie, it is a simple beautiful movie with the ability to conquer the hearth of people, nothing more than that. That is why I waited long time to write about the film, I knew I couldn't stop myself from making this movie sound like the best film of all time. Because, it was the best film for me, but will it do the same for you? I hope it will, enjoy the movie!

She and her son, Ben (Jonathan Taylor Thomas) have been on their own for years, but now she's met an attorney, Jack Sturgess (Chevy Chase), and fallen in love. When Jack moves in to Archer's loft, he quickly learns that it's going to be rough going with Ben. To make matters more complicated, Jack routinely helps put away criminals with dangerous connections. Can Jack save his relationship with Sandy, save his job, save his life and become a welcomed stepfather to Ben all at the save time? I feel a bit sorry for Chevy Chase. Regardless of what he's like personally, I think he's genuinely talented, and not just for comedy. But he's acquired such a reputation over the years for being in sub par stinkers (mostly unjustly deserved, in my opinion) that I think it's a major hurdle for audiences to give his films a fair chance. That's a shame, because this is a very good film, with a good performance from Chase and the rest of the cast.It's important while watching to not expect Man of the House to be an over-the-top comedy. It's as much a drama as anything else, and has adventure\/thriller aspects as well. All of the genres are entered into from more of a child's or adolescent's perspective, which is appropriate for the material and venue.From that perspective, scenes about the Indian Guides (a plot point that may have swayed my view of the film even more, as it brought back memories of my time in the Indian Guides with my dad back in the early 1970s) are just as weighty (both seriously dramatic and funny) as chase scenes with an impending threat of death. Other seemingly minor elements are also given more weight than they would have from an adult standpoint, and logic, plot progression and even physics are coming from a kid's world, not an adult's. That's not an easy thing for a 40-something year old director to achieve with just the right tone, but James Orr makes it look effortless.The scriptwriters weave the various threads of the film together very nicely, as Jack uses connections from his work to make the Indian Guides even more fun and educational, while at the same time, saving his relationship with an important client. In fact, the funniest material in the film comes from fish out of water themes. Various characters are regularly approaching activities they would normally avoid, with inappropriate attitudes, clothing, and so on. The subtext of the film, stemming from the fish out of water material, concerns furthering self through understanding and furthering others--opening up to new perspectives, trying different things, cooperating with others, and so on. Initial resistance makes things difficult, but the attempt to understand and further others brings happiness.The entire principle cast is great, but Man of the House also benefits from a number of excellent character actors, including George Wendt, Art LaFleur and Richard Portnow. Like most films, you'll enjoy Man of the House more, and get much more out of it, if you leave your expectations\/preconceptions parked at the door.

She and her son, Ben (Jonathan Taylor Thomas) have been on their own for years, but now she's met an attorney, Jack Sturgess (Chevy Chase), and fallen in love. When Jack moves in to Archer's loft, he quickly learns that it's going to be rough going with Ben. To make matters more complicated, Jack routinely helps put away criminals with dangerous connections. Can Jack save his relationship with Sandy, save his job, save his life and become a welcomed stepfather to Ben all at the save time? I feel a bit sorry for Chevy Chase. Regardless of what he's like personally, I think he's genuinely talented, and not just for comedy. But he's acquired such a reputation over the years for being in sub par stinkers (mostly unjustly deserved, in my opinion) that I think it's a major hurdle for audiences to give his films a fair chance. That's a shame, because this is a very good film, with a good performance from Chase and the rest of the cast.It's important while watching to not expect Man of the House to be an over-the-top comedy. It's as much a drama as anything else, and has adventure\/thriller aspects as well. All of the genres are entered into from more of a child's or adolescent's perspective, which is appropriate for the material and venue.From that perspective, scenes about the Indian Guides (a plot point that may have swayed my view of the film even more, as it brought back memories of my time in the Indian Guides with my dad back in the early 1970s) are just as weighty (both seriously dramatic and funny) as chase scenes with an impending threat of death. Other seemingly minor elements are also given more weight than they would have from an adult standpoint, and logic, plot progression and even physics are coming from a kid's world, not an adult's. That's not an easy thing for a 40-something year old director to achieve with just the right tone, but James Orr makes it look effortless.The scriptwriters weave the various threads of the film together very nicely, as Jack uses connections from his work to make the Indian Guides even more fun and educational, while at the same time, saving his relationship with an important client. In fact, the funniest material in the film comes from fish out of water themes. Various characters are regularly approaching activities they would normally avoid, with inappropriate attitudes, clothing, and so on. The subtext of the film, stemming from the fish out of water material, concerns furthering self through understanding and furthering others--opening up to new perspectives, trying different things, cooperating with others, and so on. Initial resistance makes things difficult, but the attempt to understand and further others brings happiness.The entire principle cast is great, but Man of the House also benefits from a number of excellent character actors, including George Wendt, Art LaFleur and Richard Portnow. Like most films, you'll enjoy Man of the House more, and get much more out of it, if you leave your expectations\/preconceptions parked at the door.

The man who brought us Twin Peaks, Blue Velvet, and Eraserhead directs Mulholland Drive, a movie that makes no sense what-so-ever, and any attempt to figure out what exactly happens is an exercise in madness. There is no point in me describing the plot, it is too difficult to explain, it just has to be experienced. Naomi Watts plays a peppy twenty-something year old from the Midwest who goes to LA to become an actress. Laura Harring plays some woman who was in an accident while in a limo and loses her memory. She doesn't even know who she is. Beyond that, what is real and what is not is hard to figure out, but Dan Hedaya, Robert Forster, and Ann Miller are featured as background players. There is loads, let me repeat LOADS of symbolism in Mulholland Drive, but what everything means is open to interpretation. I think the last half of the movie is a dream, and if you remember your dreams, sometimes time and space are warped, nothing is linear. That is what makes the most sense to me. Also, I think the first half of the movie is about how Hollywood is a horrible place to make a living, but that could only be one way at looking at it. Mulholland Drive is not a movie in the sense most people think of movies. Instead, Mulholland Drive is a piece of art that has to be looked at critically, interpreted as the meaning that the painter hides deep in the movie is hard to finger. David Lynch has always worked in symbolic, strange, out-there methods, and Mulholland Drive is no different. The lasting part of the movie that stayed with me the longest was the soundtrack. Very little music, instead deep, almost so low you can't hear it noises make up the background, as if the boom mikes were sitting too close to amplifiers or some other interfering device. It is unsettling to have to listen to that for the entire movie, and adds to the uneasiness that is the movie. It is a difficult movie to get through, but by the end of it, perhaps you have learned something about yourself, or you could turn to your friend and ask what the heck did I just watch?

Any movie that can make Keanu Reeves look good has to have something special with it. Anyone who has seen any movie since 1999 knows the 360 degree camera pan around an actor, perfected by The Matrix. Reeves plays Neo, a computer programmer at some nameless company who has an underground cult following for his skill. This leads him to Morpheous (Lawrence Fishburn), a man looking for prophet, and he thinks he found it in Neo. Carrie-Anne Moss plays Trinity, a nod in the direction of Christianity, as she is a follower of the prophecy of Neo who happens to do her best work in catwoman-type leather. A refreshing change of pace in the beginning of the movie, as most of the physical challenges involved the martial arts, not running around with things that go boom, but we knew that could not last forever, and the final part of the movie has guns, lots of guns. Hugo Weaving plays the unemotional, almost too perfect Agent who chases Neo down on several occasions during the film, and is the movie's most interesting character. We'll have to wait until the following movies in the Matrix Trilogy to get more in depth when it comes to Agent Smith, and that's too bad. While we are blowing away our minds, I wish The Matrix would have gone all of the way, and make it so we don't trust ANYTHING anymore.

One day I'll catch all of his directed films. In this catching process, I had the chance to watch The Color of Money, which should be important for reasons as the movie that gave Paul Newman's his first and only Academy Award; or the very good performances and character development.As soon as the movie opens, there's a guy talking (Martin Scorsese, wow) about a game, but, for some reason, you can also sense he's talking about life. Paul Newman's performance is splendid. He creates a man that has lived too much, but enjoys life and just wants to live it until the end. We watch him he seems like any other man. We listen to him he knows things the rest doesn't. He has a normal job, but also invests; in excellence, we learn. When someone asks him about his excellence, he declares I study people's character.Vincent's excellence is pool. 9-Ball, to be accurate. When he and Eddie (Newman) meet, he's just a player. A pure player who makes some money playing, but doesn't know he could make much more. There's a world he doesn't know. As Eddie invests in excellence, he wants to take Vincent on a tour. Cities, tournaments...Money. Maybe it's all about money. Eddie is, or was, a player, we realize, and we learn. He will try to teach Vincent the secrets of the game, how to do it.And Carmen. Well, she is the center. She's Vincent girlfriend (We've been together for a year). She met him when she was robbing his house. Vincent loves her, and decides to join the tour because he's afraid of loosing her. Does Carmen love Vincent? Maybe. There's also the chance that she loves him for the money she can make with him. But she says good things about him all the time. I think they're both really in love, and that this journey tests their love.This journey is about achieving the human sides of the people involved in it. It's great to hear a script talking about persons with pure knowledge about some special things. This is a character piece in every way and the greatest time you'll probably have it watching that part (if that isn't just the whole piece). Yes, it is also about the game, but not that much. Because first they have to reach a human level before they can get to the game.Now, about the supporting performances (because there are other performances but not as deep and not as important). I like to think that there was a time when Tom Cruise could act, and wasn't much of an image. I mean, in the last years he did some good roles, but not that good; Come on! He has this habit; he screams when he's trying to show some emotion. It really works, or at least, worked here and in Jerry Maguire (probably his best performance). He's fine here, he was still an actor at that time, and chose good roles. The truth is I don't like him very much, but sometimes he can really work it out.Mastrantonio is calmed in her role. Calmed and natural. An excellent performance. I would say that her character is rational and intelligent. She wants something more exciting, and she needs to find it.I loved Forest Whitaker cameo as Amos, had to say it.There's one scene, when Vincent is playing against a guy, and the camera starts to move in circles, showing Newman's face in a background, and also showing alternate faces of all the characters.

Jackson and John Travolta) who kill at 4 people during the course of the movie, a crooked boxer who promises to take a dive (Bruce Willis), and a drug pusher (Writer\/Director\/Average-at-best Actor Quentin Tarantino)? It's not what they do, but how they come to their decisions, the major decisions that they make during the movie that a hopeful vibe comes about. Take the characters Vincent (Travolta, in an Oscar nominated role) and Jules (Jackson) as two under-armed hit men. After the two whack 3 rookie drug dealers, then accidentally shoot their inside man, each goes off their own way and save someone, both metaphorically and physically, and in doing so, are saved themselves, again both in the physical and metaphoric sense of being saved. The aspect of Pulp Fiction most remember is the script. Things are said by Tarantino's characters that had not been said in movies in years. What would normally be cut out by antsy editors are left in here to give the characters depth, add humor to the movie, and gives the audience something to remember. Who forgets the first scene of the movie after the opening credits, where Vincent and Jules discuss hamburgers in Europe. Or the Bible verse sermonized by Jules before he goes through with business. And of course, the music selections made by Tarantino are almost as important as the script or the actors. It is said that Quentin will pick the music for his movies before he writes the script, it is that important to him, and he uses this extra character in the movie pitch-perfect. The opening credits employ the use of Miserlou, which has become synonymous with Tarantino and features songs from the 60s and 70s to add more depth to each character. We know the Jules is a funk fan, as he chooses to play Jungle Boogie in his car, and that Mia (Uma Thurman) is adding an undertone of sexuality by playing Girl, You'll Be A Woman Soon while entertaining Vincent. This scene comes after Son of a Preacher Man welcomes Vincent into her home before the big date at the 60s restaurant where we get to see Mr. Saturday Night Fever dance again. The lure to Pulp Fiction comes from the sum of the parts. The acting is great, humor comes from unexpected places, notably in the final act with Harvey Keitel's man who cleans up problems, and the music all add up to a good movie. The underlying sense of hope is what gives Pulp Fiction it's stature as one of the great movies of the 1990s.

You wake up, eat some breakfast, get stuck in traffic, then go to work where you have to do the same thing everyday. The movie Office Space, the creation of Mike Judge, creator of Beavis and Butthead and King of the Hill, examines how wearing it is on some people to go through day after day after day of people telling them they didn't file the TPS Reports correctly or that the fax machine does not work. Ron Livingston plays Peter Gibbons, a fed up 20 something professional who is a computer programmer for some faceless software company. The Gibbons character one day finds himself in a rut, and wants to get out of it. He begins by not showing up to work, then when he does show up, telling a pair of consultants (John McGinley and Paul Wilson) of what he really thinks, even when it goes against the philosophy of the higher-ups. As Peter begins to change his outlook on his place in the world, his two friends Michael Bolton (not that Michael Bolton, instead a paranoid genius played by David Herma) and Samir (Ajay Naidu) begin to see it his way, for better or for worse. The character who steals the movie, however, is that of the big boss man, Bill Lumbergh, played by Gary Cole, who's pandering to his employees leads to the signature Yeeaahhhhhh, a sign of indifference to the plights of the common man. Little observations, especially those rooted in repetition, is what makes Office Space as funny as it is. The movie ends with an ultimately satisfying conclusion, though a direct result of a total cleansing of all issues leading up to the end, a bit of a cheat, but nothing that is unforgivable. The movie also features Jennifer Aniston and a frustrated waitress at a kitchy, TGIFridays-esquire restaurant where everyone needs to have sufficient cheer on their uniform, though no one really knows what that is. Office Space is an exercise in pointing out what is wrong with society and why nothing is ever done about it. A fun look at the dumbness that is the role of the common worker makes Office Space the cult classic it has become.

Their favorite toy, their favorite video, no socks. Christmas morning is the most eagerly anticipated 2 hour period of the year for many, and the movie A Christmas Story shows us why. The minute the last speck of the Thanksgiving turkey leaves your plate until you wake up Christmas morning, the season of giving, but more importantly for kids (and some adults) getting, is in full swing. Anything is possible, Santa has a sleigh full of presents, just for Ralphie (Peter Billingsly) is just waiting for Dec. 24. All Peter wants is a Red Rider BB Gun, the one your mother, and every other mother in the world, tells you that you'll shoot your eye out with. Ralphie uses the days leading up to the classic 1950s American Christmas trying to find a way to get his BB Gun. He writes a theme for his school teacher, he tries to convince his parents that there were grizzly bears at his Indiana town's candy store, he even asks the big guy Santa for a gun. All requests were pushed aside with the now famous phrase You'll shoot your eye out! The scene involving Santa (Jeff Gillin) is especially funny, a scene right out of Bad Santa which came out 20 years later. Originally thought of as a failed adaptation of Jean Shepherd's book In God We Trust, All Others Pay Cash about his childhood (Shepherd narrates the movie and has a cameo appearance as an irate father, scolding Raphie and his brother Randy for cutting in line to see Santa) by director Bob Clark (infamous for the Porky's movies), A Christmas Story caught on in the mid-1990s as a holiday tradition, one cable network even devotes 24 hours Christmas Day showing the movie over and over and over and over again. The reason I think the movie has become a holiday favorite is that parents can watch this movie about a kid and his Christmas dreams and enjoy the look back at their childhood. We all knew fathers like Ralphie's (Darren McGavin) who would be a happy man if the Bears won and the furnace didn't falter everyday. We all knew mothers like Ralphie's (Melinda Dillon) who is stern with her kids, but will stick up for them when they needed it. I don't know if we all knew siblings like Ralphie's brother, Randy (Ian Petrella), but I certainly did. We still fight the same way Ralphie and Randy did to this day.

Like with Chandler's scripted Double Indemnity, we get the story told in flashback (under strange circumstances), and many of the familiar tones and notes in the subject matter (femme fatale, of course, and also the big half-wit and the 'good girl'). But what makes the film memorable even more on a repeat viewing (as my second time around, and not having read the novel but not being a stranger to Chandler's works) were a few great assets.For one thing, Dmytryk supplies steady and surprising direction, with many shots and shadows throughout characteristic of the style of film at the time. There is, of course, the unforgettable, shocking (in terms of 'how did they do that back then') scene involving Philip Marlowe (Powell) in a tortured state. He's been injected with something by someone (or some people), and sees 'smoke' all around him. The camera lens is covered with a kind of glaze that pops up again in another scene- one of the most exciting in the picture- and that was the kind of approach that really struck me about the film long after I saw it. There is always a swift, cool touch of atmosphere in many scenes, even the ones that don't draw attention to themselves (which are also done wonderfully). On that note, Dmytryk's work on the film, with the look of the film as well as the proper casting (some of it appropriately one-note, some of it not), is flawless.For another thing, there is the performance by Powell, his turn from his previous musicals and comedies. It would be one thing to try to compare his work to Humphrey Bogart in The Big Sleep, but I'm not sure that would do the film justice. I found that there were notes of humor in Chandler's writing that weren't carried as well as could've been, and maybe he doesn't seem to carry off that sense of 'aloof' that I found when I read Chandler's Marlowe. But then, Powell is also very strong at carrying his performance in and of itself, by having a certain level of ingrained charm that keeps him afloat with the other character actors. He's not the first actor you'd think to play a private-eye (not like Bogart, who for my money fared better anyway as Sam Spade), thankfully however he didn't over-play some of the cynicism, which was just getting accustomed to the audience of the times. And when the film gets relatively dramatic, he finds the right pitches and reactions with the story (it's one of the more amusing aspects in all of film-noir with his chemistry not with the women, but with the actor playing Moose Malloy).Mystery stories may come and go with time, but the work of Chandler outlasts many stories without a grounded sense of humor, believable and likely characters, and twists to keep people on their seats. The movie is no exception, and it's got a few good quotable lines to boot.

Resident Evil is based on a video game, but probably could have been based on a night of heavy drinking and watching 2001 A Space Odyssey and Night of the Living Dead, one after another. In Resident Evil, an evil bio-research company, called Umbrella Corp, or something silly like that, manufactured a virus that brings the dead back to life and causes them to want to eat other people. The standard horror movie rules apply, if someone is bitten by a zombie, they will become a zombie, zombies can only be killed after certain parameters occur (almost always where something is severed), and the girl with the most revealing dress and the biggest boobs will be the de-facto hero of the film. Milla Jovovich plays Alice who wants to steal the virus to somehow protect the world from it gets caught up in the building where the virus is stored has a security breach, and that causes all heck to break loose. This is where HAL 9000 takes over, errr, rather Red Queen takes over, as the computer has to shut down the building to make sure the virus does not escape, and will do anything to make sure it doesn't happen.

As the pieces of this awkward jig-saw puzzle that is the Star Wars saga come together, it has become more and more difficult to judge the stories of each chapter. How will it set up the next movie? How much of the first and second movies relate to the last 3 movies? Do we need to care about these characters? After the final movie of the the 6 movie series by George Lucas hits the screens in May 2005, the successes and failures of The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones will finally be clear. I say all of this because I have always been a fan of the Star Wars movies, and as excited as I was to see new movies about the time long ago in the galaxy far, far away, it has been hard to say that these first two movies have been what was expected. The original Star Wars movies were full of joy and whimsy, going places we have never been before, battling an enemy we have never seen before, but can identify with. Good vs. Evil is easy to see, and perhaps it's that the early episodes in the saga are murky in who's good and who isn't hinders the films. The Attack of the Clones looks great; we know everything is generated by a computer, but still looks right and good enough that we accept it as real. My favorite scene is how the special effects artists zooms from one passing ship to another, making it look like it was shot with a real camera. The acting is wooden, perhaps encouraged by the dry script. The love story we are subjected to is pretty lame, which for forbidden love, that's hard to do. Where is Han Solo and Princess Leia's sassy triste when you really need it? Ewan McGregor is good enough as Obi-Won Kenobi, but the other characters are unmemorable and uninteresting. The story itself, I will say this, it does leave a lot of interesting places for the 3rd film to go, assuming of course Lucas does that. I said the same thing after Phantom Menace but Attack of the Clones didn't really capitalize on the openings that were there. Again, the ultimate judge on this film is how it fits in with the other segments of the Star Wars saga. If this was the build-up to a climatic Revenge of the Sith, then it will be worth your time to check out Episode 2. If the third movie veers off into other plot points, then don't waste your time with Attack of the Clones. Just go out and rent The Empire Strikes Back for a well done middle cog to a 3 movie trilogy.Note After seeing Revenge of the Sith, this movie is almost rendered pointless.

The movie accomplishes each of those tasks fine, and though unfair, when comparing Jedi versus the other two films, it's the weakest. That's not to say it's a poor film, to the contrary it is still most entertaining, but the slow pace to the beginning of the movie takes away from the high energy that Empire Strikes Back ends on. If you'll recall, at the end of Empire, our heroes Luke, Leia, Chewbacca, Lando, and the droids are searching for Han Solo (Harrison Ford) who is being held by the gangster Jabba the Hutt. That's the warm up to the movie, the story line continuing Luke and Darth Vader is much more interesting and leads to the ultimate end of the movie and saga. One of my favorite scenes in all of movies comes at the end of Jedi, the final battle between Luke and Darth Vader, long-shots, big music, sends chills up my spine. The movie was intended to be directed by George Lucas' friend Steven Spielberg, but a union technicality nixed that idea, and little known Welsh-born director Richard Marquand does the job. We also get to see the sinister Emporer, played by Ian McDiarmid under layers and layers of makeup, he adds another piece to the force puzzle. Then there are the ewoks, those cute little made-for-merchandising furry creatures that occupy the middle of the movie. They're cute, but after the dark, adult themes of Empire, the ewoks evokes a kiddy charm that takes away from the maturity level of the Star Wars movies. I would have liked to see a planet of wookies over a planet of ewoks, but what do I know?

This obviously causes a lot of conflict within he team and it is only to protect his white players that Yoast decides to stay on as the defensive coach. When the players go to training camp the conflicts are everywhere and Boone's first job is to bring the team together.Usually when movie premieres come onto terrestrial television they are trailed big time and are put in plum spots; so when this film was simply dumped into the daytime schedules at Christmas time I feared the worst and, for that reason, didn't get round to watching it until February. As with many films, there is plenty of good in it but it is dented a bit by its weaknesses. As you would expect it to be, this is a simple story of race conflict being resolved within a group of youths who then become a winning team and, in the telling, it doesn't do anything out of the ordinary. Now that is not to look down on the real story behind the film but the film itself cannot help but spoil it by always going for the easy clichés, the simple and corny bonding moments that summarise a difficult journey and, whenever possible, sticking in some mighty, swelling music to make sure we all understand how emotional that particular moment is.What this does is reduces the true story of a turbulent time to the level of melodrama and, while I admit it would have been hard to do it any other way, it cannot help but damage the film a little. However despite this it is still quite enjoyable and those that can forgive its self-indulgence will find much to like about it. However for me it was hard to get past the corn and I was only able to see an average sports movie with a core of a lets understand each other storyline. The sports stuff is OK but never gripping and the characters are a touch too generic to be really involving. It is fortunate then that the performances are mainly reasonably good, certain good enough to keep the film lively and watchable. Washington delivers a good performance even if it lacks any subtlety or edge to it; likewise Patton is right out of the playbook and does what is expected of him. The support cast have some good performances and some corny performances but generally they all do well enough to match the tone of the film.Overall this is an OK film that is quite enjoyable but doesn't do anything special. While having enough to involve and just about entertain, the film still suffers from being overly melodramatic, corny and loaded with moments that come across as rather clichéd. If you can accept this then it is a good film, otherwise it is just an OK one that will grate on you occasionally.

","genre":"Biography, Drama, Sport"},{"date":"13 February 2005","score":"10 out of 15 people found the following review useful","review":" The Invisible Man is a fantastic movie from 1933, a cutting edge film for it's time where objects appeared to rest on top of a man who was truly invisible. Go ahead, take a look at the film, you will be shocked that it was made in 1933, it was the first true special effects movie. Come 2000, computer aided special effects seem like child's play, audiences are not blown away by special effects, instead they are disappointed if they are not done right. The special effects in Hollow Man, the update of the HG Wells story, are OK, but not the biggest problem with this film directed by Paul Verhoeven, who you might remember from Showgirls and Total Recall. Kevin Bacon plays Sebastian Caine, a scientist dabbling in the world of bio-invisibilation (yeah, I know that's not a word) but of course is battling higher ups who are threatening to take away the team's funding. So, as movie characters who are about to have their funding cutoff are prone to do, he makes the ultimate sacrifice and becomes a guinea pig for the invisibilation (yeah, I know, I used that non-word again) process. The process has dire consequences, no Caine does not die, but instead becomes a horny, violent creature, aka a guy. Now that he's invisible, Caine stalks a sexy neighbor, a co-worker, former girlfriend Linda (Elisabeth Shue), and the man who took away his funding. Then a funny thing happens, Caine becomes a new supernatural being, The Thing That Won't Die. Laughing in the face of all things natural, Caine faces down death and spits in it's face, as it take what feels like hours for this creature to die, dragging the ending of the movie out. The movie is silly, stupid, and finally laughable with the way realism is sometimes used, sometimes not. There are neat possibilities in Hollow Man, but of course, not one of them is explored. For a more interesting look at an invisible being, get ready for some good old-fashioned black and white cinema, and check out the 1933 Invisible Man. Kevin Bacon will still be invisible when you come back, probably still alive at the bottom of a volcano.
