Not just ones that we occasionally see on the weekends, but those that buy you a round when they know you are blue, those that have lived their life right next to yours, those that will not quit even when you want them to forget about you &#150; those are the friends that remain constantly in your mind. In Last Orders we have a unique opportunity to see a group of four friends escape their lives to take one of their greatest friends (and family) to his final resting place. Using a flashback technique that teeters on confusing at times, we witness six of our greatest actors dive deep into the hearts and souls of the characters they are portraying. For once, in cinematic history, we see a story unfold that each and every one of the actors support, as well as contributes more than 100% to their respected roles. This isn't a perfect film, but the flaws are overshadowed by the actors. Each and every one of the actors in this film carried their weight (and then some) as we felt our heartstrings pulled and friendship refreshed.As already mentioned, the acting in this film is superb. It reminds me of discovering that perfect bottle of wine &#150; all the characteristics of the blend are working in unison, creating a masterpiece out of what would be nothing more than than just your standard bottle of grapes. The core of this film is bland. Last Orders will not impress you with phenomenal storytelling or scenes that will demand your full attention &#150; in fact &#150; if it weren't for the actors who took their subsequent roles in this film &#150; I probably would have fallen asleep shortly after the credits. Last Orders is a dry film. There is no denying that, but what sets the bar are the actors. Michael Caine and Bob Hoskins give the performances of their careers in this little independent film that should have seen more attention.. Helen Mirren continues to prove that she is one of those diamonds in the rough when it comes to small roles. She can handle either the big stuff or the small stuff, she continues to give her full ability each time. The rest of the cast, Tom Courtenay and David Hemmings, make this group of friends even more thoughtful. Then, there is Ray Winstone. I have always appreciated his work since seeing him in Sexy Beast, and this film just brought him to a whole new appreciative level. He works, along with the rest of the players in this film, to ensure that their heart and minds are diving their characters into our hearts. It is amazing that even with a weak script, this film was made better by those involved both behind the camera and in front of it.With this applause for the actors, of which I can continue, but would sound like a repetitive critic, I must say that I wasn't impressed with the story. I thought that director Fred Schepisi did a decent job with the imagery, long viewing landscapes accompanying our lush actors, but this story was a challenge to create as a screen writer. Throughout his commentary, he talks about how he felt he had to guide the audience better through the flashbacks &#150; there were quite a bit of them &#150; but without giving us the proper guidance, we just jumped. That was tough because we weren't fully introduced to the younger version of the characters with the respect that we were with the older generation. At times we jumped with no reason, coupling our minds to be both confused as well as needing immediate readjustment to the situation. One moment we were in a Mercedes driving, the next we were in a doctor's bed, the following we were in a war scene. For the casual viewer, this would have been a difficult transition to follow. For me, the jumps seemed too sporadic, too forced to push the story. Unlike the book, each chapter isn't dedicated to each character, we must juggle the time, and I think Schepisi could have accomplished this task better. He picked the right actors to play younger versions of their subsequent actors, but it took some time to make sure that we, the audience, knew who we were working with. It was a struggle for this film, and it nearly &#150; for me &#150; took away from the phenomenal-ness of the actors.There were other issues with this film with continuity and placement, some of which are typical in any budget of a film, but others occurred due in part to the constant change of time. It is hard to change time as often as Schepisi does without missing some details, and again, it distracted in this film. The pacing seemed lacking, I don't remember the book being as dull in some points, but I think it was because Schepisi didn't want to overload us with so much information. The scene with the actors in the Mercedes as they drive to their friend's final destination was beautifully framed, amazingly acted, but seemed extended, dull, and a bit drawn out. That, for me, best summarizes this film. Acting and vision were impressively intense, but the film seemed to slip because of structural issues.Overall, I liked this film, but could not say that I loved it. I will stand behind Last Orders as a film that boasts the best acting from some of our most unique actors, but Schepisi could have done a better job behind the camera. If it weren't for the actors, this film would have drastically fallen. I am glad that our director pushed for great actors, but I think it is in part because he knew the story wasn't as strong as he wanted. This was no Six Degrees of Separation or Roxanne, it stands on its own &#150; it just isn't sturdy enough.Grade *** out of ***** ","genre":null},{"date":"8 September 2007","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Friends.

Well, he succeeded but he also started the beginning of the end for the original Batman franchise. His campier approach to the source material is indeed fun to watch (at least in this installment) and for what it is worth really quite entertaining. You do get the feeling, however, that he had been curbed just a bit so as not to make the franchise succumb into camp and silly one-liners. Too bad the producers didn't continue to hold him back because I, for one quite enjoyed this installment into the Batman series.Michael Keaton chose not to return as Batman because he wanted to prove that he had the versatility to play something else than Batman. Val Kilmer was cast as the lead instead and wanted to play the character in the same vein as Keaton, with a great measure of seriousness (much to Schumacher's dismay who already wanted to go all out camp) and for what it is worth I actually think Kilmer managed to pull of a reasonable Batman. I don't think he holds a candle to Keaton but an adequate performance. He balances Bruce Wayne out quite a bit and never becomes as manic or as brooding as Keaton was. In light of the obvious return to the camp values of the 60's series Robin was introduced. Not so much to lighten the tone (hardly necessary) but more to give the Bruce Wayne character some new interesting challenge. Chris O'Donnel got the part (ahead of Christian Bale, how weird is that?!) and while not the most talented of actors he is kind of fitting as a sidekick. As the new love interest Nicole Kidman was introduced and she is smoking hot. Her character is really kind of pointless but she serves her purpose as eye candy perfectly. Two new villains are introduced, Two-Face and The Riddler in the forms of Tommy Lee Jones and Jim Carrey. Jim Carrey is a riot to watch. Not really faithful to the original character but fun, fun, fun. His performance is much in key with what he was known for at the time. Overacting wildly and while he pulls it off, the other villain is not so lucky. Tommy Lee Jones is painful to watch. While Carrey pulls the overacting off Tommy Lee only aggravates and annoys. While Carrey was not really faithful to the original character he still stayed within the limits. Tommy Lee (not really his fault I suppose) completely goes against everything the character stands for in one little scene where he repeatedly flips his coin to get the outcome he wants. Something he stated earlier to be the only true justice. This kind of alteration to the character is just not acceptable.The soundtrack is not nearly as catchy as the one in the two previous movies. I guess they really wanted to distance themselves from the original movies and that means that instead of Danny Elfman's brilliant notes we have to settle for mediocre Elliot Goldenthal's only acceptable score. The score is bombastic like Elfman's but it has no charm and is not a score you will hum to yourself once you've seen the movie. Much in key with the soundtrack the sets have been revamped into a neon-filled neo-noir style which is appropriate given to tone of the film but it is just not as interesting to watch as Burton's Gothic version. The neon lights are used excessively in one scene in particular which just comes off as ridiculous.The action is decent, not as tense as in the original movies but fairly entertaining. The action was dumbed down quite a bit and some more or less ridiculous sound effects were added but they were fun to watch. Now I'm not saying that Michael Keaton had the perfect physique to play Batman but they film makers had the good sense not to let him show of his torso in full screen. They do this in one scene where you can quite obviously tell that Kilmer's physique was inferior to Chris O'Donnel's.

The Bone Collector follows quadriplegic forensic expert Lincoln Rhyme(Washington) and rookie cop Amelia Donaghy(Jolie) in their pursuit of a serial killer. The killer leaves clues at each murder-scene concerning the time and place where his next victim will die. Amelia, haunted by her father's suicide and Linc, who has a strong death-wish since his accident 4 years ago, have to overcome their fears and deal with their issues in order to focus on the investigation, save the victim before her\/his death and catch the killer before he strikes again. Linc guides Amelia through the crime scene investigations (through radio contact) and she becomes his eyes and legs on the scene...The Bone Collector reminded me a lot of Se7en and though it is inferior it's certainly as entertaining. It may not have Se7en's brilliance( though it is brilliant at times) but I can't help but love it too. The main leads are in top form Denzel Washington's always exceptional but Angelina Jolie is surprisingly good in this too. She's a good actress but I've seen mediocre performances of her too. There's a lot of controversy about the ending but I found it to be very satisfying, though I can see why some people didn't like it. I don't mind putting aside a little believability for excitement. The rest of the cast is decent, though the two leads steal all of their thunder.The dialog is OK, though no one-liners come to mind. The music and sound were very fitting it aided in building up the right mood and it was never too explicitly present( which can break the mood too...see Notes On A Scandal). The Bone Collector isn't as harsh or brutal as Se7en but it's definitely disturbing. It's probably not for very sensitive viewers, there are some close-ups but they're essential to the story (the gore is functional, if you will).I've seen the film multiple times and I've never been able to turn it off when I come across it flipping through the channels on TV. There's some charm to the film I can't describe. It's definitely worth a look and will give mystery-thriller fans what they need...I highly recommend this very entertaining film.7.5\/10 (rounded up to a vote of 8, since you can't vote half's on IMDb...)>C.

These movies were typically dark and bleak in their world view (STAR WARS would soon change all of that for better or worse; and from the maker of THX-1138, no less). The OMEGA MAN, though, is about a military scientist named Robert Neville (Chuck Heston himself) who, after a biological holocaust, seems to be the last normal man left in L.A. (are there ANY truly normal people in L.A.?). The other survivors have become albino, light sensitive, night crawler mutants (unlike the vampires of the book and 1st movie) who are like a cross between Edgar Wynter and the Manson Family. They've all taken to wearing sunglasses and hooded cloaks, and are genuinely creepy. Their main beef with Neville is that he tends to hunt them down during the day, with no more feeling than if he were squashing cockroaches. After Neville's capture by Mathius (the albinoid leader, played with relish and a lot of ham by Anthony Zerbe), he is freed by a radical band of drop-out med students and hippie-type kids who are trying to cure the mutated albinos. Neville is a bit uptight with this idea, as he attempted it before (in a flashback scene) and it didn't go over too well. His liberator, a Mod Squad, Angela Davis-type rebel (played by Rosalind Cash) wants Neville to cure her little brother, Richie, who is turning into an albino (insert bad Michael Jackson joke here!). Neville DOES find a cure, with his own blood (shades of Jesus; the one Bible character Heston hasn't played!). Well, now that he CAN cure them, does he WANT to? As Richie tells him, You just don't belong...you're hos-tile! So, little Richie takes it upon himself to extend the olive branch to the albinos......bad idea. There's more gunfire, and a typically downer '70s ending (I DO miss those every now and then). On the plus side, the early scenes where Heston is alone in an eerie, ghost town L.A. are moody and VERY effective(all without CGI!). And he plays the loneliness-bordering-on-insanity very well. Honestly, the first 45 min. or so are my favorite. The rebel scenes later on are a little bit too BILLY JACK for my taste (not that BILLY JACK isn't one of the funniest films EVER made, but save it for another time). The 1st filmed version, LAST MAN ON EARTH, was closer to the book but fatally miscast (I love Vincent Price, but he is from a very different school of horror). If you could somehow scoop Heston out of this movie and into that one (with OMEGA's creepier looking mutants, too) you'd really have something. As for the new version with Will Smith (who was inspiring in PURSUIT OF HAPPY-NESS; on auto-pilot in I, ROBOT), I will probably see it for love of the book.

Pretentious. The unavoidable word when it comes to reviewing so much of the vastly overrated European crap.Alphaville is NOT a city of the future. It's a 60s city which hasn't heard of moon-travel, let alone galactic travel - which is so laughably mentioned at one point. (Lemmy Clochard at one point refers to Alphaville as Zeroville, and he pretty much speaks the truth.) If you don't have a sufficient budget, either don't do your own version of Metropolis at all, or use your directorial imagination as to what you should film in order to create the illusion of such a city with what little money you have. But Godard is no Tarkovsky (Solaris\/Stalker), not even at knee-level. He desperately needed that 50-mil budget. In fact, I can see why Billy Wilder called Godard a lazy bum this little Frenchman (I assume he's little) wasn't bothered much with either the look of the movie or the story. He just got a cameraman, a crew, some very average actors, and his damn I-wrote-it-in-an-afternoon script. Any of Godard's philosophical preachings could have been placed anywhere in the movie he literally stuck them anywhere, most of the time. By having no meaningful plot, he established a perfect terrain for himself to throw in any speech about anything anywhere in the movie. For example, that stuff about Communism and Capitalism needing to establish plans might as well have been in the first 5 minutes or the last 5. The movie actually starts out fairly interestingly. While some people may be put off by the narrator's voice, I liked it - at least for a while, until its overuse undermined the overall effect it could have had. (Less is more.) Nevermind that computers don't sound like fat old Euro-trash grease-balls with encroaching throat cancer, but the voice did lend the movie some much-needed atmosphere. (But to suggest Kubrick's Hal 3000 is in any way related to this computer's voice is quite silly.) The music at first seems appropriate, or at least an interesting choice, but the repetitive nature of it very quickly becomes headache-inducing. (Less is more. But this particular piece of fortune-cookie movie-making true-and-tried philosophy is something Godard has never heard of, being too immersed in the works of Sartre or Hegel to have time to learn the craft of film-making.) After only 10 minutes I realized that this movie isn't going to make much sense and won't have a story, so I basically decided to patiently sit it out, hoping that at least I might find something interesting\/worthwhile in it.I've checked Godard's filmography and - sure enough - the man made about 4-5 films per year, in the mid-60s. This movie is a rushed job, and it's obvious. On the other hand, considering how quickly he did it, it's not even that bad! Maybe he's some kind of genius after all.How can Godard have his characters use light-years as a replacement term for years or decades? Did this divine intellectual wannabe have no time to read up on some BASIC science, especially physics, in-between all those mostly bulls**t philosophical ramblings from the exalted German, Greek and French household names? What's with the French Bogart's description of the leading lady's teeth being sharp and vampire-like? Only moments later we are shown her face - as she smiles - and her teeth seemed absolutely normal. Or maybe I'm just too DUMB to understand the rationalization (i.e. bulls**t explanation) behind this? Nah...Maybe the French Bogey is delusional for saying this (about the vampire teeth) hence I missed out on an essential clue regarding his character? More evidence of Godard's embarrassing lack of knowledge about science comes in form of this supposed future world having conquered not just our Solar system, not just the neighbouring stars, not even just our galaxy, but OTHER galaxies, too! In the meantime, this superior human race (at least the ones in Zeroville) can't even guard their own most important control buildings, hence any clochard like Lemmy Clochard can just barge in and out of them, killing everyone in sight with his cheap pistol.And then the movie ends in a silly finale in which Godard hired all of Paris's unemployed mimes to stumble around like drunken fools.

Nah...Maybe the French Bogey is delusional for saying this (about the vampire teeth) hence I missed out on an essential clue regarding his character? More evidence of Godard's embarrassing lack of knowledge about science comes in form of this supposed future world having conquered not just our Solar system, not just the neighbouring stars, not even just our galaxy, but OTHER galaxies, too! In the meantime, this superior human race (at least the ones in Zeroville) can't even guard their own most important control buildings, hence any clochard like Lemmy Clochard can just barge in and out of them, killing everyone in sight with his cheap pistol.And then the movie ends in a silly finale in which Godard hired all of Paris's unemployed mimes to stumble around like drunken fools. Apparently, the computer had been screwed over by Lemmy Scarface in some way, and the inhabitants of Crapoville are disoriented. Whatever... And then the movie's final words I love you. How cheesy. Love conquers technology you can't get any more poetic than that! (Nevermind that Lemmy has a face only a mother can love (unless the girl was referring to love for mankind or some such crap), provided of course that his mother is a lizard.)This is the kind of movie best enjoyed by people with an inferiority complex regarding their own intellect i.e. lack of it, the kind that insist on liking and understanding Picasso, just so they can prove to themselves and others how smart they are...Btw, if you want a chuckle, check up on a black and white photo of Godard looking at a film-reel &#150; with his sun-glasses! WAY too cool, way way too cool for this world&#133; Charlatan...(This comment is dedicated to all the hard-working French syndicate members who are seeking a 30-hour work-week.)

Evidently, its success spanned other movies of a similar- yet not as good nature, likewise I know What You Did Last Summer, in addition to silly and innocuous spoof movies such as the Scary Movie series.What was so great about the Scream films though was that there was no way of telling who the killer was, the first time you'd seen it.

When I first saw the first movie, I had no idea that Sidney's boyfriend was the killer, alongside one of her so called best friends. Also, the victims weren't as hapless and hopeless as we'd come to expect, as all of them put up a brave fight and attempt to make their escape unharmed.The twists in Scream were clever, but what was also clever was in finding out and discovering the sheer motives and reasons, as well as actions that led up to and during the killings by the killers themselves. The performances from the leads ranged from the very good to terrific; hence, Friends's very own Courteney Cox Arquette successfully manages to plays against type as a roving reporter, and the build-up to the actual revealing of the killer's identity is full of suspense and intrigue, whilst Neve Campbell does a good job playing would-be hero, Sydney. Therefore, it's not so much the blood, gore and killings that shock and leave the audience baffled but rather the final outcome when everything is out in the open, the whole truth is revealed and the murderer unmasks himself.In all, Scream is one rare and yet extremely intelligent horror thriller.

The plot has been around forever - a beautiful woman seduces a man because she wants him to help kill her husband. What Wilder does with it demonstrates his mastery.Wilder's genius starts with the casting of Fred MacMurray, Everyman if there ever was one, as Walter, an insurance man. A boring profession and what appears to be an ordinary, albeit attractive man who is also a good salesman. Barbara Stanwyck is Phyllis, the femme fatale. Blonde with a beautiful figure, an icy, challenging manner, and a seductive voice. Edward G. Robinson is Keyes, the insurance investigator and good friend of Walter's. Dogged yet warm as he follows clues to what he believes is a murder and not an accident.There's nothing tender about the MacMurray-Stanwyck love affair, and Stanwyck delivers her lines in a cold, calculating way - the same way she does the love scenes. Walter comes off as fresh at first - what salesman would flirt with a married woman as obviously as he does - but he probably realizes when Phyllis appears wrapped in a towel that she probably wants him to. There's nothing spontaneous about Phyllis asking about life insurance for her husband; it's been on her mind since Walter showed up to renew the car insurance. The minute she says she doesn't want her husband to know about it, Walter knows what she's up to. Though their plan is brilliant, Keyes is smarter than they realize.I love the way it's introduced into the plot that Phyllis was the first Mrs. Diedrickson's nurse and that Lola, Phyllis' stepdaughter, suspects Phyllis hurried her mother's death along. I also love Walter's cold feet as he becomes interested in Lola - but it's too late.Double Indemnity can only be described as compelling - it's not action-packed but there isn't a wasted or slow second. Stanwyck, who could be a very likable actress, plays a real conniver, and she does so brilliantly. MacMurray gives a relaxed performance - he's actually perfect casting, as one can see how easily he gets sucked into Phyllis' plan. Edward G. Robinson is the film's anchor as Keyes, who is like a father to Walter but also a man who takes his job very seriously. He's determined to get to the truth of the case, and every word he says is like chalk on a blackboard to the guilty Walter.Wilder's brilliant direction and pacing shows in every frame, and the surprise ending is the icing on the cake.

Others here have already summarized this film, so I am going to move straight to the comments... First, this is not a film for everyone. If you are one of those who insists on reality in your entertainment, you will be disappointed here. If you are not imaginative enough to understand what is going on, you won't enjoy a minute of this film. However, if you like a good tale woven through with interesting ideas and clever dialogue, this one is for you. The Baron himself is an interesting character, as his very being alters depending on which is dominant, reason or wonder. When all is going his way, and everyone believes in him, he is younger, with the flashing (literally) smile, but when the drab, violent world of reason takes over, he becomes old and worn. There are a number of wonderful performances, and a few great cameos (look for Sting as the heroic officer who is sentenced to death for his heroism, because it makes everyone else look bad, and that is terrible for morale...). Also look for Robin Williams as the King of the Moon, now fancying himself King of Everything, Ray di Tutto (and Robin is credited as Ray D. Tutto as a wonderful gag, since nobody could mistake him for anyone else), a young Uma Thurman in a dual role that includes Venus (the goddess), Oliver Reed having a grand time as Vulcan, and Eric Idle in a dual role that includes Berthold, the fastest man alive. There are some great visual touches too, such as the moving constellations during the space sequence, or the point where Vulcan reaches down into the pit they have fallen into, appearing to tower over them, only to be revealed as the same height as the mortals after he reaches in and pulls them out. In summary, this film has wonderful writing, is very witty and imaginative, has some great actors in some very enjoyable roles, and is a visual feast. Highly recommended. If you've seen this film, and you didn't understand it, don't worry, there are a lot of movies out there for you, with straight-forward, unimaginative plots that don't explore any new territory.

Tutto as a wonderful gag, since nobody could mistake him for anyone else), a young Uma Thurman in a dual role that includes Venus (the goddess), Oliver Reed having a grand time as Vulcan, and Eric Idle in a dual role that includes Berthold, the fastest man alive. There are some great visual touches too, such as the moving constellations during the space sequence, or the point where Vulcan reaches down into the pit they have fallen into, appearing to tower over them, only to be revealed as the same height as the mortals after he reaches in and pulls them out. In summary, this film has wonderful writing, is very witty and imaginative, has some great actors in some very enjoyable roles, and is a visual feast. Highly recommended. If you've seen this film, and you didn't understand it, don't worry, there are a lot of movies out there for you, with straight-forward, unimaginative plots that don't explore any new territory. For the rest of us, there's this wonderful gem.

Barrie's Peter Pan stories. The combination sounds perfect and Hook is generally a good film, but unfortunately it doesn't realize its full potential. However, that's not to say that the film's premise isn't sound. In fact, it's an interesting twist on the Peter Pan stories Peter Pan has grown up into a work-obsessed father that neglects his kids and has forgotten ever being Peter Pan. Along comes Captain Hook to rekindle the old rivalry between himself and Peter and Peter has to relearn his old ways to combat Hook.I'm not sure why a film about Peter Pan was titled Hook, though, as catchy the title is. The film seems to try to justify this titling by inserting numerous references to hooks early in the film. Putting aside the title, the film has decent though few sets and a great score from John Williams.The film does have a good cast. Robin Williams is appropriate to play a Peter Pan that has grown up but needs to rediscover his past. Julia Roberts proves a fine choice for the role of Tinker Bell. Charlie Korsmo does well as the more focused on of Peter's two children and the rest of the supporting cast is suitable as well. Maggie Smith has a notable appearance as Wendy. The outstanding performance in the film, however, is Dustin Hoffman as Captain James Hook. Hook is portrayed as flamboyant and foppish with a haughty laugh, yet also sinister and at times sarcastic. It was quite amusing how he denoted acts as being either good form or bad form. Bob Hoskins is also amusing as Hook's sidekick, Smee.Where Hook isn't as consistent is in the story. Initially a good story is developed, but from there the execution of the premise is mixed. Most of the film is solid and the film has some great moments, particularly where Captain Hook is involved. However, it tends to get bogged down at times by lingering on scenes such as the insult battle and subsequent food fight. More of the film's time should have been spent on the conflict between Peter Pan and Hook. The final conflict left something to be desired as it relied too much on random contraptions and one child's girth as weapons. The ending is satisfactory even though it is very much expected. Despite its flaws, Hook is a fun Peter Pan film.

But he's 6 years old and looks at this film as Oscar material, to be honest I wasn't expecting much since I was very satisfied with the way the first one ended. While I agree that this was not any where near up to par as the first one I still thought that this was a cute movie. As far as sequels go, you have to admit that All Dogs Go To Heaven 2 is better than most. The voices were actually closer than usual and the story was still pretty charming. Even though the first one seemed to have an official conclusion, this was just a new introduction for those little one's who might have missed All Dogs Go To Heaven.Charley has a new friend in Heaven, Itchy is there to join him. But Charley is getting a bit bored with the whole purity and typical days of being there. Carface has won an award for being the most turned around angel and it seems like things are working out for him, only he's really after a horn to give to Satan, or at least the Satan of dogs. But when Carface drops the horn, it goes down to Earth, Charley and Itchy are sent to get it, but Charley is quickly distracted by a beautiful dog, Shasha, who is taking care of a homeless boy, David. Since Charley is an angel, they can't see him, until he finds out that Carface, who is also down on Earth, has a special collar that will make him and Itchy visible, but Charley should watch who gives him that collar, he might be expecting something more in return.All Dogs Go to Heaven 2 is over all a cute movie. Even though that it was silly and not needed, for the kids it worked very well. The animation is pretty much like the same, but the new characters are very sweet and lovable. It's just a sweet little family film and I feel the rating is a little bit harsh, but I understand for the fans of the original. Like I said, it destroys the point of the first one, but I'm not going to spoil that for you. But I would recommend for you to give this a shot, but it's OK to just stick with the first film, that ended the story just fine.6\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"8 September 2007","score":"6 out of 9 people found the following review useful","review":" My cousin and I watched the All Dogs Go To Heaven films yesterday and we both liked them.

Now I loved Happy Gilmore and my sister asked me if I ever saw Billy Madison and I said no, and she just looked at me with shock and said that if I liked Happy Gilmore that I would love Billy Madison. So I rented it yesterday and watched it this morning, I admit this was a fun story and had some funny moments, but for the most part I think that this is a pretty over rated comedy. There were just some jokes that either went too far or were to immature for my taste, but then again, it's Adam Sandler, so I'm not making that big of a deal. The story though was actually a clever one, who hasn't thought of what it would be like to go through school again at a grown up age? Billy Madison is the son of hotel tycoon millionaire, Brian Madison, and Billy is someone who you wouldn't call the smartest tool in the box. He sees imaginary penguins, leaves dog feces out on his neighbor's porch, and still talks gibberish. Now he's supposed to be a grown man, but Brian knows his life isn't going to last very long, and that he needs a grown up like his associate, Eric, to take over the hotels. But Billy convinces his dad that if he can go through all the grades, 1-12, one more time and pass, that he can take over the hotels. Brian agrees, and Billy is back to school and meets the hot 3rd grade teacher that is going to help him out. Just hopefully he can do this in time so he can actually say that he passed with flying colors.My problem with Billy Madison is that I didn't know if he was supposed to be retarded or someone who acted retarded at times? Just this wasn't the most well thought out comedy. I just don't get into the grown man acting like a total idiot, you know? I prefer other Adam Sandler comedies like Happy Gilmore, The Wedding Singer, Big Daddy, Anger Management, and Click where he actually acts like a grown up, those actually work comedically. But I admit that I did have a few laughs here and there and it was a fun story to watch, but this is one of those movies that I'm satisfied with seeing only once.6\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"8 September 2007","score":"4 out of 8 people found the following review useful","review":" Billy Madison, this is the film that supposedly gave Adam Sandler his huge break in Hollywood along with Happy Gilmore.

To be honest I don't think any of the Friday The 13th films are bad I found them all great. Being the huge Jason fan for as long as I remember I really enjoyed Jason killing off teens on a cruise ship a little different, as you don't see many slasher movies set on cruise ships.Although there were a few things I was disappointed with in this film, some of the deaths weren't shown and others weren't that good This sequel also slaps in new gimmicks and they don't really work. I'll start off with the teleportation vibe. What was up with that? This entry has Jason being able to materialise anywhere he wants, which is just stupid and the back story involving the main heroine and Jason was just pointless.Jensen Dagget (Rennie) is good at playing the female lead and plus she's stunning, Peter Mark Richman (Charles) excels at playing the cruel headmaster\/Rennie's uncle you just love to hate him, Scott Reeves (Sean) is good and easy on the eye as the good hearted hunk, VC Dupree (Julius) is amusing as the tough guy, I enjoyed the scene where he keeps punching Jason then Jason takes his head of literally, Barbara Bingham played the kind hearted teacher Miss Colleen Van Deusen well very likable but ends with tragic results Sharlene Martin (Tamara) plays the one-dimensional slut to perfection. The acting is actually very good.All in all I'm a big fan of Jason, Kane Hodder rules as Jason, OK it is a bit of a let down in places but it's still enjoyable.

One is a young woman ( Lexia Doig) and the other is none other than Jason Voorhees(Hodder). They bring both bodies on board their spacecraft, where both subjects eventually thaw out and the one wearing the goalie mask goes on a murder spree.When I first heard that the 10th entry in the franchise is gonna be Jason in outer space, I thought that it sounded stupid and was gonna be rubbish but when I saw the film I was pleasantly surprised, sure it was corny and the story line is ridiculous but I loved it Jason is back and he's on form unlike the disappointing previous entry Jason Goes To Hell.This 10th chapter in the Friday the 13th franchise retains the same energy as the previous entries but delivers it in a spaceship setting. You want to see Jason put Rambo to shame as he hunts down some ex-grunts? Right here, a-holes! Or how about Jason going mano-a-mano against a leather-clad, gun-toting female Android? You got it! Jason X has its fair share of slash and crash, but at the same time, it emanates an Aliens (an obvious inspiration) type of vibe. Some purists might say that's a negative thing, but I believe that after nine films, Jason needed a change of scenery like I needed a new bootie call. They slapped old hockey-puss in space and managed to pull it off. Props to all! Okay the film is low budget but I found the special effects were pretty good, the spacecraft simple yet effective costumes are colourful. I particularly enjoyed the S&M-like outfit that Kay-Em (Ryder) sported after getting her robotic cherry popped. Nice! Our boy Jason hasn't changed much. He felt more human this time around though (he has hair!) and doesn't look like the zombie he was in part 6-7-8-9. I found Jason less menacing than he was in Friday The 13th Part 7, but he still got the grisly job done. I also loved it when Jason gets the big terminator style makeover where he's all metal and robotic and such and such like. The fight sequence between Jason and the robot woman is definitely the highlight of the film and the kills are wicked and fresh.The good thing is that Jason X is just a good cheesy slasher and it doesn't pretend to be anything else but that. Yes, the good guys are weak and the film doesn't always capitalise on its groovy situations but we still get lots of explosions, kills, fights sequences, some occasional funny dialogue, some humorous situations (loved the Virtual Reality sequence) and Jason even gets to re-visit Crystal Lake to entertain two female campers in his own charming way.Kane Hodder (Jason) gives Jason more of a human personality this time around, but I didn't find him as threatening as he was in the previous entries. Lexa Doig (Rowan) handles her part well, but I would've liked to see her kick more ass. Lisa Ryder (Kay-Em) steals the show as the sexually curious, Kung Fu android. She has fun with the role. Jonathan Potts (Professor Rowe) does the pathetic creep thing well, but yes, he irritated me. Melyssa Ade (Janessa) is cute and her delivery is on, but her character didn't do it for me. She's kind of despicable. Peter Mensah (Sergeant Brodski) was charming as the resilient Marine. I loved every second that he was on screen. Chuck Campbell (Tsunaron) bored me as the geek and he had his moments of weak acting.All in all being a hardcore Jason fan I absolutely loved this entry in the Friday The 13th series, I loved the female robot, the action sequences, the kills and the over the top special effects.
