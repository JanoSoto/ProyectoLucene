I've always loved Whoopi Goldberg. She is a very funny, very smart woman. She's an original.The other female genius behind the film is director Penny Marshall. This film was panned if I remember right, and I'll never understand why. It's just a delight to watch, paced nearly perfectly from start to finish. It's got an interesting plot that stays fairly spare (to go into depth about how and why Jack came to be trapped in Russia in the first place would have taken an extra hour to explain), and easy to follow. Though it has almost wall-to-wall comedic dialogue, when things get serious or dangerous, the villains are among the nastiest you'll ever see on film.During the mid-to-late 80s, the KGB of the former Soviet Union was a hot topic and made for some cool movie plot devices. A New Yorker named Terri Doolittle (Goldberg) has an average life. She gets up, goes to work doing money transfers at a bank, comes home, watches some TV, and goes to bed. She doesn't dream of adventure or excitement, even though a friend of hers, sexpot Cynthia thinks Terri needs to get out more.One day Terri, after being scolded by her boss for having too many chats on her terminal with overseas bank associates, gets IM'd by someone calling himself Jumping Jack Flash. He won't go into detail, yet, but he says he desperately needs her assistance. Bewildered but unable to blow Jack off completely, she uses a famous Rolling Stones song's lyrics to break a secret code-key so that she can correspond with Jack on a private computer channel. Before she's realized it, Terri is up to her neck in the world of espionage, treachery, treason, deceit, all those fun mystery words! The whole spy plot, along with Goldberg's many quotables, plus a great supporting cast including Annie Potts, Stephen Collins, and John Wood, as well as many bit parts\/cameos by the likes of Jim Belushi, Jon Lovitz, Jeroen Krabbe, Phil Hartman, Carole Kane, Michael McKean, Garry Marshall, Jonathan Hyde and Traci Ullmann, makes this film fun, and it never fails to get me laughing! If I had to name any flaws, it would be that the romantic thing that seems to develop in Terri about Jack wasn't necessary. But then, even if it's one-sided, it is possible to blow up an imaginary romance in your head with someone you talk to a lot, but do not really know. I'd say that Jack and Terri probably stayed good friends for a long time, if not for life. She saved his ass, after all. But the romance thing just didn't belong in this one.

Hart becomes Kingsfield's momentary target and loses his breakfast for his troubles. This is the inauspicious beginning to the twists and turns of the first year of law school as depicted in the very fine film The Paper Chase. The thrust of the story is not only about the law school itself and its trials and tribulations as portrayed in the courtroom-like lecture hall of Kingsfield's contracts law class but also the distractions that can interfere with the studying process.Although the story centers around James Hart, played with exceptional realism by Timmothy Bottoms (the actor was only 21 or 22 when he played the role which would have been quite young for a law student), the star of the show is really Prof Kingsfield, played with emotional detachment and cruel insensitivity by John Houseman in an academy award-winning performance. Kingsfield is the pure unemotional intellectual who, fairly or unfairly, challenges his students--even to the point of cutting them down as a way to weed out those who probably won't be able to make the grade. Rumor has it that Prof Kingsfield was based on a real-life Harvard Law Professor who was known for his cut-throat antics towards his students in class while also being one of the most expensive attorneys in the country.Several other stories interweave with Hart's experience at law school. There is the study group, made up of a mixed bag of lawyer-minded students who also have ambitions and egos the size of Mount Everest. There is Ford, the bow-tie-wearing student who is probably the most intelligent of the one-l students. There is Willis Bell, the intelligent but arrogant fellow student who thinks he is smarter than everyone else including Kingsfield. Seems like every college class has a Bell of some kind. Edward Hermann has a small role as another student who seems closer to the correct age for law school, and the most level-headed of the bunch. And then there is Kevin Brooks, intelligently and realistically played by James Naughton, the memory-gifted student who probably aced all his exams as an undergraduate but doesn't have the kind of mind to analyze tough law cases. Naughton's portrayal is exceptional and often overshadowed by Houseman's. Hart also becomes involved with a woman (lindsay Wagner) but doesn't really know who she is until about half-way through the story. She also becomes a distraction to his studies.But of course, the best scenes are Kingsfield's contracts law class. Houseman seems like he was born to play the tough law professor who would give a KGB interrogator a run for his money. He is tough, uncompromising, unforgiving, and not terribly complimentary, even towards his best students. But as the film progresses, you get the sense that he is strangely fair. Law is not the profession for the weak-minded or the thin-skinned. In the first scene he challenges Hart to fill this room with your intelligence. Better to find out in your first year if you really have the kind of mind, and skin, to be in the world of lawyers. And you have to negotiate Kingsfield if you want to continue the obstacle course.A relatively realistic portrayal of the toughness of Harvard Law School seen through the eyes of the students and all the ins-and-outs that go with it. And John Houseman as Kingsfield is worth the price of admission alone. A movie not to be missed particularly if you are thinking of entering the world of law. And be prepared if you do. There will most likely be a Kingsfield that will judge whether or not you have a case to pass.

He looked and sounded so different from anybody else, particular the musicians who were on TV a lot, like Abba and David Cassidy. He was scary, unique, funny, and behind his penetrating stare there was an almost ruthless, questioning intelligence. I never bought for a second what the authorities said about how The Sex Pistols would create a corrupt society. I thought a corrupt society had created The Sex Pistols, and I thought their music - and the music of the many bands they influenced - was brilliant. This thought-provoking documentary is a companion piece to Temple's 1980 cult classic The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle. But whereas that was the brainchild of their egocentric impresario manager Malcolm McLaren, this is their story in the band's own words. It deals with the social upheavals of seventies Britain which gave rise to them, and then does an excellent job of charting their progress from alternative music club heroes to national pariahs to chart topping music icons, to disillusioned and ripped-off losers, without pulling any punches. Typical Sex Pistols day; internal band punch up in limo, sign prestigious contract in front of Buckingham Palace, get wasted and trash record company offices, record a number one hit single (God Save The Queen, which was subsequently banned) and get fired by your new label. If anyone has the right to call themselves anarchists, it's them. Some of the footage in this film comes from Swindle and other familiar sources, but there is also lots of new stuff, particularly some intimate pieces with Vicious, which make his pathetic, tragic fate all the more sobering. It's also packed full of tub-thumpingly great music and performances from a terrific band who compressed so much energy into their short-lived career. A must for all punk fans and for anybody interested in one of the most influential musical movements of all time.

Nevertheless, it easily surpasses Live and Let Die and The Man with the Golden Gun. This time Bond discovers Ernst Stavro Blofeld has almost as many lives as his white cat. Blofeld's global criminal syndicate has been stockpiling diamonds and the Prime Minister wants British Intelligence to investigate. Of course, 007 has no idea Blofeld is behind the diamond smuggling ring because he iced the arch-villain in the entertaining pre-credit sequence which marked the return of Sean Connery after the debacle of On Her Majesty's Secret Service and one-time only Bond George Lazenby.United Artists had given Lazenby the boot, while Saltzman & Broccoli induced a paunchy Sean Connery to assay the role once more after he'd quit the series following You Only Live Twice. Indeed, everybody was concerned that the serious-minded but perhaps best Bond of all time&#x97;On Her Majesty's Secret Service had failed to attract audiences. They feared meant 007 might have lost his license to entertain. Diamonds Are Forever proved the cynics wrong as the franchise rebounded, but Connery didn't bounce back for Live and Let Die. Connery abandoned Bondage again, later to return in Never Say Never Again in 1983. Speaking of returns, actor Charles Gray who had appeared in You Only Live Twice as a British contact returned, but this time he played a foppish Blofeld in a khaki-type uniform jacket, smoking a cigarette in a holder.Indeed, many things about Diamonds Are Forever resemble Guy Hamilton's Goldfinger. The laser that nearly emasculated 007 turns into a larger laser with enough power to destroy submarines, missile silos, and above-ground missile launchers. Diamonds departs from the formula by having Bond and M discuss 007's latest mission with Sir Donald at the diamond ministry. This single scene after the title credits dovetails what might have been two scenes, the usual one in M's office and later in Sir Donald's office, into one scene. Hamilton had two scenes in Goldfinger where Bond received his assignment and then met with M and the Treasury people about gold. In Goldfinger, the villains held Bond hostage for most of the picture, but in Diamonds he spends most of his time undercover as a member of Blofeld's syndicate, helping smuggle the diamonds into America. Unlike Goldfinger, Q Branch provided Bond with no gadgets, but Q shows up briefly in the Las Vegas scene to equip Bond with a voice altering device like Blofeld had that enables him to masquerade as the world's richest hermit, Willard Whyte.Briefly, the British are worried somebody is stockpiling diamonds either to depress prices or perhaps blackmail the British. British Intelligence has traced a suspect, Peter Franks (Joe Robinson), who is going to a rendezvous in Amsterdam with Ms. Tiffany Case (Jill St. John of Tony Rome) who may have more clues about the case. British Intelligence arrests Franks and Bond impersonates him, meets with Ms. Case, learns he is about to earn his $50-thousand by smuggling a chandelier of diamonds into America. Meanwhile, Blofeld has dispatched two homosexual hit men, Mr. Kidd (Putter Smith) and Mr. Wint (Bruce Glover of Walking Tall), to tidy up things by eliminating the people in the pipeline so nobody can trace them back to Blofeld. Franks escapes from his captors, reaches Amsterdam, and dies in a savage elevator slugfest with Bond who then swaps wallets with Franks. Tiffany searches Franks, covered in foam from a fire extinguisher, and looks shocked when she glimpses his Playboy membership card. Appropriately shocked, Tiffany exclaims, My God, you've just killed James Bond! Bond chuckles, It just proves no one's indestructible. You don't kill James Bond, Tiffany reprimands him, and sit around waiting for the cops to arrive. 007 conceals the diamonds in Franks' body and Ms. Case and he fly into Los Angeles with Mr. Kidd and Mr. Wint on the same airplane shadowing their every move. Felix Leiter, posing as a customs official, meets Bond at LAX and watches while some mobsters load Franks' casket with the diamonds into a hearse. Bond rides with them to Las Vegas where the body is to be cremated. The funeral home removes the diamonds and puts them in an urn for 007 to leave for the next member of the pipeline. Wint and Kidd bash 007 over the head, stick him in a casket and send him off to be incinerated. Comedian Shady Tree and the funeral home director rescue Bond moments before being immolated and curse him for leaving them with phony diamonds. Bond goes to Las Vegas, soaks in a tub at a casino motel, and awaits the arrival of Q and the diamonds.After the diamonds reach America and go to Willard Whyte's research labs, Diamonds seems more like an adaptation of Dr. No and You Only Live Twice. Bond receives the surprise of his life when he discovers that not only is Blofeld alive but also that the criminal mastermind has doubles everywhere with duplicate cats. Eventually, Bond rescues the real Willard Whyte (country and western crooner Jimmy Dean) who Blofeld has held hostage. Blofeld used an ingenious device that makes his voice sound precisely like Whyte's voice. Blofeld has taken over Whyte's global network and holds the man hostage. Since nobody has seen Whyte for five years&#x97;the character resembles Howard Hughes&#x97;he makes the perfect kidnap hostage. Eventually, Blofeld is able to launch a satellite with a laser and threatens to destroy an American city if Washington, D.C., doesn't cough up bucks galore. As for the serious tone of the previous Bond, the writers decided to make Diamonds much more tongue-in-cheek, almost to point of parody. Bond destroys Blofeld's newest base on an oil drilling platform and disables the laser satellite. But does he really kill Blofeld? You'll have to watch For Your Eyes Only to know.
