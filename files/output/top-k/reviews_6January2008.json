Beth Heke (Rena Owen) is the mother of 5 children and is the principal descendant from Maori warriors. Her husband, Jake Heke (Temuera Morrison) is an alcoholic and a very violent person who likes to get drunk in his house and to beat his wife and also he has a resentment against Maori warriors because they doesn't accept him as Beth's husband. Their eldest son, Nig (julian Arahanga) is now in a gang with Maori influence; the second son, Boggie (Taungaroa Emile) is taken from his family due to some criminal offences and Grace (Mamaengaroa Kerr-Bell), the 13 years old daughter who suffers the most in consequence of the crisis in her family and she have to protect her younger brothers. The film follows those hard days in the life of this family and how the love of a mother can be more powerful than anything.That is the main plot of this terrific film that for me is one of the most powerful and realistic films in the 90's. The story is great and very touching and in some parts very disturbing. And the way this film is made is very realistic thanks to the superb cast full of young actors in their first role. An honourable mention to Rena Owen who makes one of the best performances in a film of the 90's and the same mention to Temuera Morrison who is just excellent in a very difficult role. The direction is superb too; is the first feature film of the director Lee Tamahori now very famous for his mediocre career in Hollywood (including the 2002 James Bond movie) and for me this is his best work until now.Conclusion of course I can't judge the life of the descendants from Maori warriors, but their seems to be social outcast. I mean the problem in the film with the family in crisis can happen in every culture of the world but it is a sad fact that the few descendants of our cultures are treated with racism. So for me this a very touching film and one of best of the 90's, with a lot of memorable lines, unforgettable scenes (my favourite is when Beth tell to her husband Our people once were warriors, but unlike you they were people with mana, pride; people with spirit; if my spirit can survive living with you for 18 years, then i can can survive anything) and with a superb cast. 10 out of 10DVD i hear a lot of things about this film, including a lot of positive reviews but it was until yesterday that i watch it. I found the DVD in a very low price, about $2.5 so it is a single edition without any extras. Anyway this film deserves to be in my personal collection.

This is now the first and only film I have seen with Marilyn Monroe as well as directed by Billy Wilder. The hype on these two seem to be correct and I look forward to checking out more from both. However, the real success of the film is the portrayal of our two leads by Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis. Both bring a fantastic comedic element to the story and play their roles to perfection. So many films afterwards have taken the general plot line&#151;two people see a gang shooting and run away\/change identities to not get killed only to end up running into the mobsters coincidentally in the city they have relocated to, and remade it. None of them come close to the level of achievement that this one has, way back in 1959.Right from the get-go, seeing the thug\/big-nosed Italians hiding in the back of a hearse in order to smuggle whiskey during Prohibition, we know exactly what we are in for. Wilder allows the story to play out on both a dramatic and comedic level, never straying too far into one to let the other fall away. Sure there are some laughs at the start, especially between Lemmon and Curtis in the funeral bar and a couple moments poking fun at the coffee code language, but only after the two go on the lam as women instrument players in Florida do the big laughs come. The two men are just so manly that looking at them in drag brings a smile to your face, let alone when they actually talk. Lemmon is brilliant as Daphne, the loquacious girl that likes to talk too much and have fun, slowly getting so good at being a female he starts to believe he is one. Just keep telling yourself you're a boy. As for Curtis, he shines as three separate roles. He must be believable as the gambling, womanizing, sax player Joe; the millionaire, yacht-owning Shell Oil tycoon; and the best friend, Conservatory-trained musician Josephine. Each character is created and used to enhance all the others as he tries to con Marilyn Monroe's Sugar into falling in love with him.Monroe plays the flighty blonde to great success. She continually calls herself dumb and the words that come out of her mouth, as well as the believing of all the drivel that comes from Curtis' tycoon (some real funny lines), prove that fact. Being that I had always heard she wasn't too bad an actress, I wasn't quite sure what to expect since my impression of her was more model used to sell seats, not any skill at the craft. While she is definitely radiantly beautiful here, I have to believe she isn't just being the pretty face. Yes, she gets top-billing, but although she isn't in the movie for that much compared to her co-stars, she does well with the time she is given. I'm not sure how successful the movie would have been without her to have the boys play off of. The glowing smile and sex appeal are one thing, but her scene of depression upon being dumped shows a vulnerability and strength through tears, yet keeping a calm, collected voice, show that maybe there really was something there.Where the film really works is with the situations brought about by the duality of our leads. Their fighting with themselves and each other, sometimes forgetting what sex they are at the moment, let alone truly are, is priceless. Lemmon's fast-talking naïveté gets him to bring the biggest laughs, thanks in part to a wonderful supporting role from Joe E. Brown as Osgood Fielding III, but Curtis is right there behind him. His machismo, used to put Lemmon in line, contrasted to his gentility, when with Monroe, is spot-on, as is the accent of affluence used to win her heart. Credit goes to Wilder for one of the best scenes from the film involving all four characters. The transitional cuts between Curtis and Monroe, attempting to let him feel love again, with Fielding and Lemmon, cutting up the tango dance floor, are absolutely hilarious. The juxtaposition of Daphne's tall, muscular frame&#151;at times leading the dance&#151;with the small, thin, elderly Brown can't be viewed without some amount of giggling.It may not be the funniest film I have ever seen, but I can totally see where people are coming from when making that statement. Released just before the 1960's, this film can be seen as incredibly influential to the comedy genre and cinema in general. One-liners are present throughout and the acting is professionally handled at all times, bringing the laughs, but also staying grounded for those moments of seriousness when relationships are failing and death seems awfully close at hand. I hope to catch up with more work from all four principals here, to view some movies of an era I am not very proficient in, and to hopefully enjoy myself as much as I did here.

This is the most cohesive, well-paced, and entertaining cut of the film, by FAR. I really hope Ridley Scott doesn't go do another cut because this one is as much as can be done without altering the script or filming new scenes.Another point I was thinking about during the film is how much of a 'theater movie' this is. I have seen the film in two forms (director's\/theatrical) a total of three times, and though I always thought it was a good film, I never quite saw what all the fuss was about. A good, solid science fiction film was what I saw each time, but I had what felt like an epiphany during this viewing. The film is easily one of THE MOST GORGEOUS things I've ever seen. Brilliantly shot by Jordan Cronenweth (and I definitely give Ridley Scott some credit for how good this looks), the film is astoundingly beautiful and effective on the big screen. When watching it one realizes that each shot was painstakingly thought out, but unlike some others I've seen, the film is so fluid that you can't stop to think about such matters.One of several flaws I still believe Blade Runner suffers from is Vangelis' then ultra-modern score, which by today's standards is so dated it's distracting. That's not to say the film isn't well-scored, but synthesizer scores always bug me because they're bound to sound dated, and this is coming from a guy who loves 80's electronic music (the good stuff, not MTV). Another distracting aspect of the score was the bizarre combination of East Asian, Indian, and Arabic music which felt completely out of place and often forced. Since I'm criticizing the movie in this paragraph I'll throw in my opinion that the script was unbalanced in points, though drastically improved over the original 'voiceover included' version. I felt that dialogue could get distractingly forced at times.Still, during this viewing of Blade Runner The Final Cut I noticed that the majority of criticism leveled at the film is a big load of rubbish. Technically speaking, there is basically nothing at all wrong with the film. Visual effects are excellent, photography and editing are accomplished, and the acting is phenomenal across the board, be it Ford, Hauer, Hannah, or Young, watching them was a pleasure.There is something the film communicates when seen on the big screen which is missing from home video viewings, and I'm not sure what it is. Is the film so visually dazzling that viewing it on a theater screen glosses over its numerous errors and some other minor flaws, or is it just that with Ridley Scott finally fully overseeing the final product the film has really improved as much as it did in my eyes? Whatever it was, Blade Runner The Final Cut is an outstanding science fiction film, not without its flaws, but still one of the most effective films in the genre I've ever seen, and though it forsakes a lot of Phillip K. Dick's philosophical pondering to focus more on the pulp-ish if quite intelligent sci-fi\/neo-noir aspect of Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, the film stands so well on its own that I left the theater overwhelmed and feeling even a bit privileged to have had the chance to view this incredible film on the big screen and learn to appreciate it more.9\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"6 January 2008","score":"7 out of 14 people found the following review useful","review":" * This comment was written following a theatrical screening of Ridley Scott's final cut of Blade Runner and is written about this newest version.Before I get started I must note that The Final Cut is a definitive cut of the film.

This is the most cohesive, well-paced, and entertaining cut of the film, by FAR. I really hope Ridley Scott doesn't go do another cut because this one is as much as can be done without altering the script or filming new scenes.Another point I was thinking about during the film is how much of a 'theater movie' this is. I have seen the film in two forms (director's\/theatrical) a total of three times, and though I always thought it was a good film, I never quite saw what all the fuss was about. A good, solid science fiction film was what I saw each time, but I had what felt like an epiphany during this viewing. The film is easily one of THE MOST GORGEOUS things I've ever seen. Brilliantly shot by Jordan Cronenweth (and I definitely give Ridley Scott some credit for how good this looks), the film is astoundingly beautiful and effective on the big screen. When watching it one realizes that each shot was painstakingly thought out, but unlike some others I've seen, the film is so fluid that you can't stop to think about such matters.One of several flaws I still believe Blade Runner suffers from is Vangelis' then ultra-modern score, which by today's standards is so dated it's distracting. That's not to say the film isn't well-scored, but synthesizer scores always bug me because they're bound to sound dated, and this is coming from a guy who loves 80's electronic music (the good stuff, not MTV). Another distracting aspect of the score was the bizarre combination of East Asian, Indian, and Arabic music which felt completely out of place and often forced. Since I'm criticizing the movie in this paragraph I'll throw in my opinion that the script was unbalanced in points, though drastically improved over the original 'voiceover included' version. I felt that dialogue could get distractingly forced at times.Still, during this viewing of Blade Runner The Final Cut I noticed that the majority of criticism leveled at the film is a big load of rubbish. Technically speaking, there is basically nothing at all wrong with the film. Visual effects are excellent, photography and editing are accomplished, and the acting is phenomenal across the board, be it Ford, Hauer, Hannah, or Young, watching them was a pleasure.There is something the film communicates when seen on the big screen which is missing from home video viewings, and I'm not sure what it is.

The 'dark and serious Bond' audiences lauded when Daniel Craig took over the show was fine for a post 9\/11 (and post Jason Bourne) environment, but in 1989 it proved to be a disaster.Personally, I have always loved this film, and somewhat relish the opportunity to point out why its dismissal was such a tragedy. The story concerns a seemingly untouchable South American drug lord called Sanchez (think Noreaga) who escapes the custody of the CIA and, by way of making a point, throws Bond's long standing ally and friend, Felix Leiter, into the waiting jaws of a great white shark. As if this weren't enough, he also has Felix's new wife (who also seems to be rather chummy with Bond) raped and murdered. Hardly the kind of premise Bond fans were expecting!When the CIA are 'unable' to do anything, Bond quits his job as an agent of her majesty's government and goes after Sanchez alone, Charles Bronson style.This is supposedly why so many people disliked and dismissed the film when it hit theatres in 1989. Cries of James Bond would never quit his job were heard the world over, ringing around thousands of empty cinemas.What these naysayers clearly missed in the 15 Bond movies that preceded this one, is that Bond had actually tried to resign more than once in the past. In fact, as recently as 'The Living Daylights', Bond says of M, If he fires me I'll thank him for it. Why was it such a surprise that he should quit and go after a man who tried to kill his best (if not only) friend?I always considered Timothy Dalton a fine Bond. His philosophy, like Daniel Craig's, was that Bond should be a real person - dark, cynical, even angry. Dalton delivered this Bond beautifully, but this Bond was not the Bond that audiences wanted to see in 1989.The tone of the film set, Bond heads south of the border (this was also a convenient way of keeping th budget down). In a plot akin to 'Yojimbo' in many ways, he befriends and manipulates Sanchez to bring about his own downfall. Robert Davi is one of the most genuinely unpleasant and frightening baddies to ever appear in a Bond film, and the tone and authentic production design (owed largely to the use of real Mexican locations and, of course, Peter Lamont's genius as a Production Designer) allow us to really get into Bond's state of mind in the scenes between them.John Glen, in his fifth effort as director, truly outdoes himself as an action director here. The finale, in which Bond and Sanchez face off while tearing down a mountainside in a fleet of tankers, is one of the most tense and most enjoyable final reels in the series.The women are typically gorgeous here too. Carey Lowell is a tad annoying as Bond's sidekick but Talisa Soto is unmissable as the femme fatale. There's even an appearance from Wayne Newton and an early performance from a particularly nasty Benicio del Toro as one of Sanchez's henchmen.Despite Bond's defection, the writer's even managed to work Desmond Llewelyn into the film. The scene's between Bond and Q have a lovely undercurrent of affection and, thankfully, the subsequent deployment of gadgetry does not go so far as to ruin the dark and dirty mise-en-scene.The only problem this film really had was that it came a good 15 years too soon. If it were released now, as a follow up to 'Casino Royale', it would no doubt be hailed as a fittingly cynical and bleak addition to the cannon of the 'New Bond'. Don't believe the hype.

I'll let you know that I was twelve years old when this movie came out but it is my favorite movie to this day, and for good reasons.First, I'll just quickly put that Tolkein's works are possibly the most in-depth works of literature ever. I say in-depth on purpose for he spent most of his life inventing the world of Middle Earth. This fantasy world had so much time and effort invested into its creation that anyone who reads the books feels as though this world is real and could only be a short hike away. Tolkein didn't just write the Lord of the Rings stories, he created an entirely living breathing world with history, lore, culture, philosophy, and religion in which many stories were able to take place in.So how does Peter Jackson transition this great masterpiece of written work into a film version you ask? With great time, precision, effort, care, and devotion in my words. Many fans of books made into movies will often complain that the movies were failures because they didn't get the same feel that the book did and they didn't have exactly the same information, but I believe that it is very possible for someone to adapt a great piece of literature into an equally great piece of film albeit it might not be a word for word representation.I expected nothing less than outstanding work on this movie, it is after all based on my favorite book, and I must say I was well pleased. If there is anyone that could have captured the look and feel of Middle Earth better than Peter Jackson did I challenge someone to show me this person because I find it hard to believe that this person could possibly exist. And the same goes for Howard Shore who invented the very sounds of Middle Earth. Everyone involved in making this film had a lot of pressure on them, because there were plenty of people out there who would have been violently perturbed had they screwed it up. What can I say, there's crazy people out there.To put it simply, everything in this movie is the exact movie form of this book. Ian McKellen IS Gandalf, Elijah Wood IS Frodo, the set for Rivendell WAS Rivendell, the theme music for the fellowship WAS the music playing behind the marching fellowship when you read the book, that prop ring WAS the One Ring, etc. Obviously those statements aren't technically true but I think this team did the best they possibly could at portraying this story on screen.I applaud them all for giving me and many others exactly what we wanted.

But ones that were drastically different from they're predecessors. The whole vampire mythos was something that seemed decidedly passé in the 80s what with flowing cloaks and hammy dialogue.So the films of this decade solved the problem by smartly bringing vampires into the present day. The best example being the extremely underrated Near Dark, one of the greatest vampire films ever made. And while I feel Near Dark has a slight edge over Fright Night, this is yet another superior film of the genre.Fright Night is a hip, witty and enterprising attempt to bring vampires up to date. It doesn't so much deconstruct the genre the way Scream did with slasher movies. Rather it reconstructs itself for a whole new day and age while still remaining true to its origins.Director Tom Holland is clearly a horror film aficionado. After all the heroes of the piece are a horror movie fan and a former horror movie star. And Holland who also wrote the script has made sure they're well versed in everything there is to know about vampires.All the traditional aspects are there. Vampires suck blood. They sleep in coffins. They turn into bats and wolves. Sunlight and stakes are deadly to them. And they can't stand crosses and holy water. The only difference is instead of living in gloomy mansions and Gothic castles, they now live in suburbia.Its a neat reversal on what we've always believed about vampires. And it turns out to be a surprisingly effective setting. The first half of Fright Night borrows a few tricks from Rear Window when our hero, Charlie Brewster (William Ragsdale) spots his next door neighbour necking a girl. Only with fangs!Jerry Dandridge (Chris Sarandon) is the vamp in question. And he soon gets wise to Charlie's Peeping Tom routine. Despite Charlie's best efforts, nobody believes his story. And when it becomes clear Charlie won't let this go, Dandridge pays him a visit. Either he forgets what he saw, or Dandridge will kill Charlie.So Charlie must turn to his hero, TV's Peter Vincent (Roddy McDowall), vampire killer (and ham actor) extraordinaire. With Charlie's girlfriend and best pal both vamped by Dandridge, Peter becomes Charlie's only ally. They must kill Dandridge before he kills them.Fright Night is a rather appealing attempt to update vampire mythology, and achieves it with a remarkable degree of success and certainty. I'm sure that's in no small part to Tom Holland's confident and assured direction, but the astutely observed performances by the cast also goes some way towards making Fright Night a winner.Holland's witty and intelligent screenplay frames its idea in very inspired dimensions. Its a knowing and very self-aware film, and that extends to the characters too. In particular Jerry Dandridge.He finds the classic vampire films of yesteryear to be more amusing than shocking. And he probably assumes the same of other people. Nobody is taking the vampire mythos seriously anymore, making it that much easier for genuine vampires like himself to go about their nightly hunting unopposed. And he never has to leave home either. It's a clever and borderline scary observation.But Fright Night is more than just a postmodern take on the genre. It's also an excellent horror film in its own right. Holland achieves a tremendous amount of atmosphere from half-lit camera angles and a reasonably effective soundtrack. Some of the selections admittedly do date the film, but some of the more subtler rhythms pulse through the background to unsettling effect.The film is also quite a tour de force of special effects work. There are FX that are staggering for 1985. Scenes that spring to mind are a vampire turning into a wolf and back again. A decomposing corpse. And Dandridge's death sequence. They're as impressive as anything you've seen in The Howling or An American Werewolf in London.But more importantly, Holland never allows the effects to blunt the horror, or the humour. Yes Fright Night is an involving scare show, but its a darkly humorous film at the same time. That's especially true of Roddy McDowall's hilarious turn as Peter Vincent. Sometimes Roddy McDowall was an annoyingly hammy actor, but with Peter Vincent he's found a character that allows him to flex his theatricality, but with the benefit of a tight script that forces him to toughen up.Also Chris Sarandon is an impressive villain. He cuts a striking figure in a long, sweeping coat. Fright Night's substitution for a cloak. And he hisses and sneers his way through the role with entertaining regard. He makes Jerry Dandridge a very charismatic, modern day vampire (with a curious taste for apples!).Fright Night is a film that set out to make a defining mark on the vampire genre, and it succeeded. Its a film that walks a fine line between horror and comedy, without ever indulging one at the expense of another. A fine and amusing redefinition of the vampire mythology that just gets better and better with age.

I've also been reading the other reviews here. For me, my Blade Runner experience began in 1984 when, at the age of 12, my friends and I were allowed to watch this R rated film by our parents. At 12 it resonated with me, particularly the philosophical aspects of the story, namely that all life is just fleeting like tears in the rain. The film instantly became one of my many favorites, but not the only favorite.As I've talked to more and more people over the years about films I find I am now in the minority when it comes to appreciating Blade Runner. I admit, and will not argue that, the film is slow paced. In fact, I'm not surprised that the slow pacing turns many people off, especially nowadays when everything has to be edit, edit, edit. As for the screenplay having inconsistencies and being too thin--well it just might. I guess what I experience when watching Blade Runner is a unique vision--Ridley Scott's vision--of a possible future where like Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, man has created androids in their own image, but they aren't happy. In fact, they are both angry and depressed that there's no purpose to life, that they have no control over when they will die and that the person who made them can't fix any of their problems.So, I disagree with reviewers that say Blade Runner offers nothing to chew on or think about afterward. Yet, my wife completely didn't get Blade Runner. She just saw it as long, boring and confusing. Her perception focused on how Deckard's character is weakly written. How Harrison Ford did a poor job of acting along with Sean Young, Daryl Hannah and several others with the exception of Rutger Hauer who she felt did an excellent job of playing his role. She didn't like Vangelis's musical score and found it completely dated and inextricably tied to the 1980's. There is discord in this household tonight! To each their own. I think this is guy's film anyway. I don't know too many females that rave about Blade Runner (not even my wife). I also think that this film has a nostalgic value. I believe if you were alive and cognizant at the time this film was originally released it has a special place despite its shortcomings. I will always enjoy Blade Runner and its pessimistic view of life, after all pessimists are realists and closer to the actual truths in people and the world.

He brings great aloofness and swagger to the character of HI (another great Coen brother's character name) and the Coens reciprocate Cage's performance by letting the camera love him. Cage is supported greatly by Holly Hunter with other great performances such as another Coen brother's favourite John Goodman. The film is superbly on what was clearly a small budget but that probably only enhances the overall quality of the move and if anything has aided the ageing process. This is a must for movie fans and a must own for Coen brothers fans ","genre":"Comedy, Crime, Drama"},{"date":"6 January 2008","score":"4 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":" Didn't see this in the theater, but a coworker told me about it.

The film is very easy to relate to and generally moves along quickly. It is easy to like the many colorful and distinct characters in this film.It is the subtext and hilarious social commentary that keeps me coming back.This is a movie that you can watch again and again with humor and subtle elements that are easy to miss the first time around so I'd go so far as to suggest buying this movie over renting it if you can find it for a reasonable price.I noticed that it's getting a 5\/10 rating (so far) on IMDb. The movie has some weak areas but they're not overwhelmingly glaring as to truly merit this low a rating. You have to take it for what it is.I'd say ask yourself the following questions before watching this movie1) Do you find the boy bands like Backstreet Boys or N'Sync to be somewhat funny? If YES, see this movie. 2) Do you think that contemporary music has become over commercialized? If YES, see this movie. 3) Are you prepared to watch a movie w\/ a somewhat predictable storyline but is FUNNY? If YES, see this movie. 4) Are you around 15-30 yrs and are SOMEWHAT familiar w\/ contemporary music scene? If YES, see this movie.The BAD - Here's why it's not a 10\/10 in my books 1) goes a little overboard at the end 2) Josie's love interest is not as well developed as it could have been - but not terrible, just not as good as it could and should have been. 3) the movie briefly slows down at a point in the movie, but then it picks up at the end. Again, not terrible at all but it does. 4) the script, although underlined with excellent social commentary on the contemporary pop-culture music scene, is Hollywood formulaic and the outcome is somewhat predictable - but the hilarious characters and humor drive it forward so it's not terribly glaring.Great cast, great direction.

There's a lot of fun in here, but I can remember being really gripped the very first time I saw this movie.Our baddie here is an entrepreneur called Max Zorin, played with huge finesse by the great Christopher Walken. Zorin, as it turns out, intends to wipe out Silicone Valley by flooding it and only one man can stop him. Okay, so the set up is fairly standard. The pre-title sequence explains Bond's involvement and provides a pleasant piece of action set in Alaska (almost ruined by a stupid and notable unfunny bit of 'surfing', complete with a cheesy Beach Boys cue).Sadly, Roger Moore looks more like he should be waiting in line at the post office than facing off against bad guys. He's pushing 60 years old here, and it really shows. If you can get past that, there are some fantastic action sequences, including a nail-biting escape from a huge fire in San Franciso's City Hall, a tremendous fire engine chase and a fierce punch-up on top of the Golden Gate Bridge.Patrick Macnee appears here for a bit of an in-joke, playing Bond's undercover ally, and some amusing dialogue ensues between them. The Bond-girl is sadly forgettable, especially when you place her next to Grace Jones as a highly original henchman. The real winner here is Christopher Walken, who literally chews the film to pieces and has some of the best bad-guy lines ever. Intuitive improvisation is the secret of genius, he sniggers malevolently.The obligatory inclusion of Q proved a tad too much here, as he appears only to introduce his latest creation - a radio controlled cat, designed for surveillance, which serves no purpose in the movie other than to try and extract a cheap giggle from the audience.Alas, it's easy to forgive the few minor gripes as this movie is largely a winner.

Don, with the help of his friends Cosmo and Kathy, hatches a crazy plan to turn their new picture into a musical success despite Lina's shortcomings ...There are certain untouchable movies the Establishment informs us we must like. I agree with some of these choices (Citizen Kane, The French Connection) and disagree violently with others (Gigi, Kramer vs. Kramer). Singin' In The Rain falls somewhere in the middle; I like and admire it, but I don't quite see what all the fuss is about. It has great dancing, some good songs (the majority of which were not written for the film), is very well made and keeps you chuckling. But for me it's not the greatest musical of all time and it's not Kelly's best movie, or even his best musical (that's An American In Paris). It's real strength I think is in the variety of dancing. Rather than either the big glamorous ballroom numbers or good-natured hot-cha-cha hoofing, it has almost every conceivable type of number; a romantic waltz, a crazy tune, a tap duet, a vaudeville stroll, a three-way jitterbug around the house, a big Broadway folie, even a ballet sequence. All of these are terrifically staged and expertly performed - the title song (originally from The Hollywood Revue Of 1929) is of course one of the most famous moments in cinema, but I prefer the zesty Moses Supposes shenanigans and the showstopping Good Morning number with all three leads in top-notch form. The film also has great art direction by MGM's design genius Cedric Gibbons, and the gentle satire of Hollywood's transition from silents to sound is nicely done, particularly by co-star Hagen (who actually dubbed herself in the scene where Reynolds is dubbing her). However, something just doesn't tickle me the way it should about this movie (and many other fifties musicals) - I dig the dancing but the romantic and melancholic aspects always seem phoney to me and pad it out. It keeps coming up with interesting moments though, like the vampy dance Charisse does or just about all of O'Connor's slapstick. It's good entertainment, but I can't help wondering if those who rate it so highly really admire it as much as they say they do. Written by Adolph Green and Betty Comden. Bizarre trivia - there are fascinatingly weird references to this movie in two science-fiction classics; A Clockwork Orange and Alien.

It has great dancing, some good songs (the majority of which were not written for the film), is very well made and keeps you chuckling. But for me it's not the greatest musical of all time and it's not Kelly's best movie, or even his best musical (that's An American In Paris). It's real strength I think is in the variety of dancing. Rather than either the big glamorous ballroom numbers or good-natured hot-cha-cha hoofing, it has almost every conceivable type of number; a romantic waltz, a crazy tune, a tap duet, a vaudeville stroll, a three-way jitterbug around the house, a big Broadway folie, even a ballet sequence. All of these are terrifically staged and expertly performed - the title song (originally from The Hollywood Revue Of 1929) is of course one of the most famous moments in cinema, but I prefer the zesty Moses Supposes shenanigans and the showstopping Good Morning number with all three leads in top-notch form. The film also has great art direction by MGM's design genius Cedric Gibbons, and the gentle satire of Hollywood's transition from silents to sound is nicely done, particularly by co-star Hagen (who actually dubbed herself in the scene where Reynolds is dubbing her). However, something just doesn't tickle me the way it should about this movie (and many other fifties musicals) - I dig the dancing but the romantic and melancholic aspects always seem phoney to me and pad it out. It keeps coming up with interesting moments though, like the vampy dance Charisse does or just about all of O'Connor's slapstick. It's good entertainment, but I can't help wondering if those who rate it so highly really admire it as much as they say they do. Written by Adolph Green and Betty Comden. Bizarre trivia - there are fascinatingly weird references to this movie in two science-fiction classics; A Clockwork Orange and Alien.

Don, with the help of his friends Cosmo and Kathy, hatches a crazy plan to turn their new picture into a musical success despite Lina's shortcomings ...There are certain untouchable movies the Establishment informs us we must like.
