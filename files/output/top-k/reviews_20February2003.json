All the praise this movie got in the trailers were from such high names as Sam Raimi, James Cameron, and Stephen King.  All of which are friends of Bill's, or friends of friends (Bill was in Sam Raimi's &#145;A Simple Plan' and he's been in just about all of Cameron's movies, and Stephen King is a friend of Sam Raimi's).  The movie was actually really good, too.  It started out kinda iffy, but as it progressed it got better and better.  The acting was pretty good, although kinda lame in some places.  The plot was awesome and pretty original with a nice twist ending.  The directing was actually surprisingly good for a debut job, too.At first, the acting, and Bill Paxton especially, was kinda lame and cheesy.  Bill almost seemed tired, which would make sense, doing double duty as director and star.  That's tough work; I can say that from experience.  Sometimes you're so preoccupied with directing, that you don't do as good at acting.  That's what it looked like was happening with him at first, but as the movie went along, he and everyone else got a lot better.  I don't really like Matthew McConaughey (which I prolly mentioned in my Reign of Fire review) but he did really good in this movie.  Very intense.  The two kids were pretty good for child actors, too.The story started out interesting but pretty average, and like the acting, just got better as things went along.  It was pretty suspenseful and just kinda nuts in some places.  That and the twist ending was really good and really made the movie.  It was really good, considering it's the first thing the writer's done.  The editing and atmosphere was well done, too.  I think I'd have liked the music better if I hadn't fallen asleep with the DVD menu on the TV and the theme playing over and over.  Whoops.Bill Paxton's directing was really good, considering the only other thing he's directed is a music video called Fish Heads in 1982, which I guess is supposed to be really weird.  But he has been in a lot of talented director's movies.  Cameron (okay, maybe not his later work, but his earlier stuff rocks), Raimi, Ron Howard, Jan de Bont&#133; no wait, he's not that good.  That and he's been in a lot of horror movies, so it's only right that he makes his feature film directorial debut with one.

Sure she may sing two tracks from her album, and she ends up becoming a singer of sorts in the story, but that doesn't seem to be the prime focus or drive of the film, but if she didn't sing, then a lot of her real fans would have been very disappointed.And people who say Britney is an AWFUL Actress should really go see some more films.

But like most ok TV Movies, they pass the time quite well, just like this one.. sure it's pretty cheesy in places, but i can see a certain age group of girls really liking this film.. it's been very well made for them.I personally would have preffered Britney's debut film to have taken itself less seriously, and be more in vein with something like She's All That, something a bit more frothy that didn't try too hard at being all grown up and mature, with teenage pregnancies and runaway mothers. A huge proportion of people who are going to see a film like this and be the key flagposts in a strong word-of-mouth campaign would be slightly older teens.. and Britney it seems would have been perfect for a well made film like that. i.e Bring It On, many guys went to see it just for the girls in short skirts, but most of them went on to recommend it to friends, because it was completely unpretensious and totally enjoyable, while appealing to both sexes.. had they coupled that with seeing Britney in her underwear, then they would have had a sure-fire hit, and a much stronger rating here.This would probably sound less offensive if i was female, but her next film should be directed by a man.. no disrespect to Tamra Davis, i LOVE Billy Madison and Half-Baked, but when it comes to handling women on screen and their sexuality, no one does it better than a man.. look at what Hitchcock did for his leading ladies!!If you are wondering whether to watch this film, and are not really a fan of Britney, but just wanted to watch a teen movie, then i would personally recommend a few others before this one.. but i wouldn't completely disregard it. Non-Cynical movie goers will find it a good enough diversion for 90 minutes. As for Britney fans (like myself) i'd off course be curious to see it, but i'll always be disappointed that it wasn't as strong a debut for her film career as it should have been.. she has obvious screen presence, and i think with the right film, she could win a huge amount of new older fans... it's hard though as her real-life persona will always interefere with the audience's pre-conception when coming into the film. Hopefully her and her team of people will learn from the mistakes of this film, and think more realistically towards a long term movie career for her, rather than just catering the fickle youngters, who gave the film 1\/10 because she didn't get naked or sing 'Baby One More Time'.

The three steamy scenes of the movie consisted of Nomi showing her breasts to a Vegas impresario, a wild sex scene in a pool (Nomi looks like a fish out of water, literally) and a brief lesbian kiss between Nomi and her main competition, Cristal Conners (Gina Gershon).Not a bad movie, if you have nothing better to watch.

It had a lot of good things going for it.  Good cast, with the exception of Keanu Reeves, good director, a good story to work from.  But even with all that, I found it to be very boring.  That could be blamed on the fact that Dracula is one of the most told stories in cinematic history, with tons of versions.  But still, it could have been done much better.  The action, what little there was, was severely lagging, and the acting talent was pretty much wasted.  However, it did have some very nicely done cinematography that was pretty interesting to watch, and the make-up effects were cool.Gary Oldman as Dracula.  That alone sounds like it'll make a good movie to me.  I mean, he's the man of a thousand evil faces.  And while he did a good job, it wasn't enough to save the movie.  And neither was Anthony Hopkins, playing Van Helsing.  I'm convinced you could put Hopkins in anything and make the movie better.  He could make a Barney movie better.  So I have to think that Dracula was a pure fluke.  So had to have been casting Bill and Ted's Ted as Jonathan Harker.  Let me speak for everyone when I say, `Huh?'  I've always liked Winona Ryder, and I liked her in this, too, as much as I could anyway.  Most of the time I was just being bored.Francis Ford Coppola&#133; he did The Godfather, and even better, The Godfather, Part 2.  Then he did Godfather 3 and that just went straight to hell.  But still, this is a guy whose done good movies&#133; wait; he also executive produced Jeepers Creepers&#133;  Okay, so maybe the guy's starting to loose it in his old age, but this was back in '92&#133; which was the movie he did right after Godfather 3&#133; wait a minute, maybe this isn't such a surprise.  Also, he did start his career working with\/for Roger Corman.  Ok, mystery solved.Then we have the story, Dracula.  Sure it's been done repeatedly, it was even one of the very first movies ever made (as Nosferatu).  There's obviously something good here, if it's being done so much.  So how come this version, with all the things that say it should be good, is so damn boring?  Maybe because it's two hours and ten minutes long.  Well, Fellowship of the Ring was even longer and that kept me on the edge of my seat, even the second time I saw it.  Maybe it's just cause somehow they messed up the flow of the movie and they had a lot of stuff going on, but nothing actually happening.Most of the time, when I do reviews, I talk about the good aspects of the movie for three paragraphs and toss in all the bad stuff in the last one.  This is a reversal of my usual way of going about things.  So, what good things were there in Bram Stoker's Dracula?  Well, through a lot of the movie, there was a lot of really cool camera work.  But even that tends to get overdone after a little while, and near the end of the movie, it just disappears.  The make-up effects were another good thing about it.  They transform Gary Oldman from young, to old, to a wolf-man, to a bat-man, to headless.  But of course, it's like any other movie Gary Oldman's in.  He never was the same look twice.Overall From everything I heard about this movie, I figured it would be great.  My uncle told me that after the opening credits, it all went downhill, and he was right.  It's more of a weird, long, boring love story then any kind of horror movie.  It's worth maybe borrowing from a friend to check out once, but that's about it.

I've always liked Winona Ryder, and I liked her in this, too, as much as I could anyway.  Most of the time I was just being bored.Francis Ford Coppola&#133; he did The Godfather, and even better, The Godfather, Part 2.  Then he did Godfather 3 and that just went straight to hell.  But still, this is a guy whose done good movies&#133; wait; he also executive produced Jeepers Creepers&#133;  Okay, so maybe the guy's starting to loose it in his old age, but this was back in '92&#133; which was the movie he did right after Godfather 3&#133; wait a minute, maybe this isn't such a surprise.  Also, he did start his career working with\/for Roger Corman.  Ok, mystery solved.Then we have the story, Dracula.  Sure it's been done repeatedly, it was even one of the very first movies ever made (as Nosferatu).  There's obviously something good here, if it's being done so much.  So how come this version, with all the things that say it should be good, is so damn boring?  Maybe because it's two hours and ten minutes long.  Well, Fellowship of the Ring was even longer and that kept me on the edge of my seat, even the second time I saw it.  Maybe it's just cause somehow they messed up the flow of the movie and they had a lot of stuff going on, but nothing actually happening.Most of the time, when I do reviews, I talk about the good aspects of the movie for three paragraphs and toss in all the bad stuff in the last one.  This is a reversal of my usual way of going about things.  So, what good things were there in Bram Stoker's Dracula?  Well, through a lot of the movie, there was a lot of really cool camera work.  But even that tends to get overdone after a little while, and near the end of the movie, it just disappears.  The make-up effects were another good thing about it.  They transform Gary Oldman from young, to old, to a wolf-man, to a bat-man, to headless.  But of course, it's like any other movie Gary Oldman's in.  He never was the same look twice.Overall From everything I heard about this movie, I figured it would be great.  My uncle told me that after the opening credits, it all went downhill, and he was right.  It's more of a weird, long, boring love story then any kind of horror movie.  It's worth maybe borrowing from a friend to check out once, but that's about it.

It had a lot of good things going for it.  Good cast, with the exception of Keanu Reeves, good director, a good story to work from.  But even with all that, I found it to be very boring.  That could be blamed on the fact that Dracula is one of the most told stories in cinematic history, with tons of versions.  But still, it could have been done much better.  The action, what little there was, was severely lagging, and the acting talent was pretty much wasted.  However, it did have some very nicely done cinematography that was pretty interesting to watch, and the make-up effects were cool.Gary Oldman as Dracula.  That alone sounds like it'll make a good movie to me.  I mean, he's the man of a thousand evil faces.  And while he did a good job, it wasn't enough to save the movie.

I would just like to say first off that this is one of the best movies based on the Vietnam War that I have ever seen.  When I first saw this movie, It deeply shocked me.  I think what interested me the most about this movie is that it was based on a true atrocity that took place during the Vietnam War instead of a fictionalized story which took place in Platoon.  In Casualties of War, the story follows Eriksson, played brilliantly by Michael J. Fox, a new and inexperienced recruit just arrived in Vietnam who is confronted with a horrifying situation when his sergeant and the other men in his unit kidnap a young girl from a village and rape her and then murder her. Fox's character is then confronted with the agonizing choice of either doing the right thing and telling the authorities and being called a traitor or doing nothing.  And when he does tell his superiors, he is told to forget about what happened and let it slide because this event will cause a major international incident and jeapordize the war effort.  Fox does a great job of playing Eriksson, the young soldier who is haunted by this one event. Sean Penn also a brilliant job of playing the sadistic and psychotic Sergeant Tony Meserve!  Penn's character starts out normal enough, but as the story unfolds, he transforms into a total and complete psycho!  And by the end of the film, you truly HATE his character and wish that he dies! What makes this crime even more horrifying is the way that Meserve justifies it.  Because he was stopped by the M.P.'s from visiting the prostitutes in town and that in his mind, she's just a gook. The rest of the supporting cast does a great job Don Harvey, John C. Reily, John Leguizamo, Ving Rhames, etc.  Don Harvey does an especially great job as Corporal Thomas Clark.  He gives off a cold and remorseless stare that just chills you to the bone.  And the things he says and the way that he acts towards the Vietnames people in the movie shows that he has utterly no sympathy and remorse as to how he treats these people.  Total hardcore RACIST!!! I bet his parents probably dropped him on his head one too many times as a child!  His is another character that you absolutely loathe in the movie. You just want to to go up to him and rip his spine out!!!DePalma does a great job of filming the scenery in the film.  It shows the natural and ancient beauty as well as the devastation and destruction that the war has brought.  The film's soundtrack is also very good.  It is very haunting and tragic and stays with you even after you're done.  The rape scenes are also very brutal and will leave you shocked and disgusted.  In the end, I think that this film is a story of morality.  It shows that we have to put bounds on our behavior or we run the risk of committing unspeakable acts.  The film also does a great job of showing how easy atrocities like this occurred because the Vietnamese were dehumanized, soldiers were taught to obey orders, and how ordinary and normal these acts became.  One dialogue that helps to show this is between Eriksson's capatain and Eriksson You just could't rest, could ya?  You had to push it.  Go to hell.  SIR!!!  One of the best lines in the movie in my opinion.  I don't think that many Americans like this film because it shows Americans in a negative light, and I think that's why it didn't get as much publicity as it did.  I think that this movie does a great job of showing that that the U.S. has a tough time admitting when we are and apologizing.  The movie shows that we are indeed a VERY arrogant nation, and we like to think that we are always right.  The atrocity that occurs in this movie also draws some similarity with the massacre at My Lai.  As with the defendants in this film, the soldiers were hardly punished.  And it took a while for the story to come out.  I also think that the movie is about redemption.  In the beginning, we see Eriksson still haunted by this event, and when he sees a girl on the train who looks just like the dead girl and tries to return her scarf.  It is clear that he is trying and hoping for redemption and forgiveness for what is done.  And after his conversation with her, the film shows that some of his guilt over this event has passed.

There is no suicide in Y Tu Mamá. Apparently that's how closely the people who disdain this fantastic film were paying attention! ","genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Drama"},{"date":"20 February 2003","score":"","review":"  (Contains a couple of wee spoilers) Things happen by a grand design. So is the point of 'Signs'. Actually its about a few other things too, but hey? Whatcha gonna do? Signs is a bit different to your usual alien invaders schtick. It actually makes you think. There is no 'God bless America' style rousing speeches, no cornball 'welcome to earth' style heroics, no 'monument lasers' or any of the other crap that's become so prevalent in the 'alien invasion' sub genre. I don't think I have enjoyed an invasion film so much since 'Invaders from Mars'. Signs is a suspense building exercise first, UFO movie second, as a result we get to see all of one alien in the whole movie. And one weapon. I know this has dissapointed most people, but it was never the intention of the director to make a heroic 'humanities last stand' type movie. He intended to, and succeeded in, creating a character driven film about a reasonably average family trying to cope with extraordinary events. Its why they don't tool up on guns, steal a space ship and take the fight to them. Its why they hide in the basement and board up all the windows. The exposition of the alien invasion is very well handled. After a series of strange goings on Graham Hess tells his kids 'no more tv', as their imaginations are running away with them. Then Graham experiences things beyond imagination and states 'lets turn the t.v on'. Which plays a pivotal part in telling them and us just what is going on. Such as the utterly marvellous scene in which Merrill sees 'them' for the first time. I also like the directing style. He seems to thrive on the mid shot, capturing so much in the frame. I was also pleased to see wonderful moments of levity in the film which do genuinely make you laugh. At the end of the day, its pretty much a no brainer to criticise Signs. Blah blah blah stupid aliens cant work a doorknob, blah blah blah why corncircles? That's not very high tech for space-faring aliens, blah blah blah earth is 70 odd % water, blah blah blah blah blah. It is, on the other hand, harder to value this film for what it is.  If you can't appreciate a movie without 200 CGI shots a minute and a 'God bless America' ending, don't watch this. You will only whine about the 'Stupid Aliens' and wonder why Graham Hess isnt capping ol' ET's ass with his M60.
