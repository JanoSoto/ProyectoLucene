It's slow death.This is the story of a cyborg cop and her team, on a mission to catch a thief. The animated movie has interesting direction, good animation, great music but a weak script.Director Mamoru Oshii goes old school, in this movie. His technique reminded me of Tarkovsky's movies. There are moments when the camera simply stops in place, lost in a long contemplation, as people go in and out of the picture. There is also the use of water. Water is a mirror, reflecting the reality above, around and beyond it.Other than that, the action scenes are well done, and during dialogues the camera has a way of focusing on the person who listens, not on the one who is talking, which may be confusing, at first, but then it becomes quite interesting. The camera moves a lot, and the director makes a point out of filling in the entire space around the characters.The animation is good, a bit dated by today's standards, maybe, but still very well done. The characters are interesting, and the surroundings are full of small, fine touches, of which some may seem like overkill, at first, but they all add to the atmosphere of the movie.The music is great. The leitmotif is haunting, it is surprising and quite stirring. It also complements very well the images on the screen.The script, however, is the weak point of the movie. It it too short and it fails to explain just what is going on in this movie. It starts well, it has great pacing and it builds nicely, but then it grinds to a halt about midpoint and it never gets going again. The main premise of the movie remains unexplained just what is a ghost and how does somebody hack into it? Are all humans cyborgs? Do they all have artificial bodies?

But I can't admit that the last thing this great soul saw, was the face of hatred and violence, as the cruelly tragic destiny of a soul that was definitely too simply noble for our sophisticated comprehension of what is right or wrong. Maybe that's what Einstein meant  Gandhi, was good on a superhuman level.But that raises a puzzling issue regarding the Mahatma's posthumous aura. A man with his magnitude sure deserves to be venerated and honored by people from all over the world. However, this contradicts the conception that Gandhi had on his own person for he never felt like being special or above anybody, not even the untouchables. Cleaning the latrines was no less honorable than being an accountant and Gandhi rejected whatever would betray his background or social category in order to banish himself from premises of comfort and luxury and make one with his people. Gandhi's ascension to power ironically coincided with an extraordinary descent into the lowest depths of Indian population, at a time where 350 millions of Indians needed the light to guide them to the Independence.Richard Attenbough's Best Picture Winner could have been one of these epics that are more excuses to display cinematic grandeur with scenes of battles, inflamed speeches and cheerful cries, but the movie elevated itself from such clichés by centering the story on the man, more than the cause, making the cause no less inspiring. The psychological dimension of the Oscar winning script invites us to follow the birth of Gandhi's political conscience in South Africa and its evolution when he would rediscover his country, struck by poverty, and the shocking injustices of the British domination. Realizing that the education of Indian elites lead to an unfortunate ignorance of the real people's basic needs, Gandhi never left the ashram (community) and progressively became the iconic figure we're all familiar with, reassembling more and more disciples and followers, among them the Pandit Nehru and Mirabehn, a British woman who devoted her life for Gandhi, intriguing the skeptical Muslim leader Mohamed Jinnah and even the British enemy, but never without some unconscious fascination.Gandhi, as any epic, doesn't lack action and thrills, but they only serve as elements that will drive Gandhi's political beliefs or influence his decisions. Gandhi's determination and defiance toward the British will clearly be reinforced after the infamous Amritsar massacre, one of the most poignant and heart-breaking parts of the film. Most of the times, we're invited to meditate on Gandhi's thoughts, and on that level, the movie has a very interesting intellectual value, changing the image of pacifist that marked the card of Gandhi. In a simple but insightful scene, Gandhi, still a young lawyer, explains to a priest his view on 'turning the left cheek' as a self-defense move. For Gandhi, it's a sign of courage and resistance more powerful than the basic use of violence, and the active non-resistance revealed itself to be crucial in the extreme circumstances when violence was expected by the British as an alibi to justify their repression.In fact, the attitude preached by Gandhi is more provocative than any act of violence or terror. And when you extrapolate this idea to our current world, you realize how visionary was Gandhi. Not to say that violence was never necessary, but have the leaders who conquered the power through violence got rid of that deadly instinct? Gandhi knew it and foresaw great tragedies. An eye for an eye will make the whole world blind A sad prediction illustrated by the civil war that torn India apart. The late scenes provided some early hints of why a man like Gandhi would be killed by his own people. It's easier to set the fire of hatred and violence but it takes a greater deal of courage to extinguish it. Gandhi firmly believed in the coexistence between the Hindus and Muslim, and the worst that could've happened was the dislocation of the territory. I was particularly moved by the Civil War sequence, not just for the historical tragedy it represented, but because it illustrated that the cause Gandhi dedicated his whole life for, was being annihilated. I was sorry for Gandhi more than anyone, how ironic that the massacred also ceased for the sake of Gandhi.As usual, the movie absorbs you in its most serene moments. When the war stops, all of Gandhi's friends, surround his frail body begging him to stop his hunger strike. Gandhi often punished himself as if he felt responsible for his people, 'Bapu' was his nickname as he was the Nation's father more than symbolically. In a significant scene, Gandhi advises an Indian, devoured by the guilt of having killed a Muslim boy as an act of revenge, to find a boy and raise him as a Muslim. This is basically, how Gandhi would have raised his people. Still, Gandhi was a man of simplicity, and perfectly embodying the spirit of the Mahatma, the simplest and quietest scenes were the best, especially those involving his tender and respectful relationship with his devoted wife Ba who, inspired by Gandhi's dedication, followed him heart and soul.

It has some megastars to say the least (and from three different worlds--Bacall from the Bogart\/crime\/noir realm, Monroe from all that she already represented by the early 1950s, and Rogers from the age of classic musicals). It is very the first widescreen color flick in contemporary terms (not including Napoleon). And it has the arch qualities of a screwball comedy--improbable matchups and improbable circumstances. But for me it just wasn't funny. The writing is pretty lame (not clever, not funny, just pushing silly buttons), and the acting is quite painful (though it might be purposely not an actor's film, but just a vehicle). The filming, with all the possibilities of the new wide format, is pretty but surprisingly stiff and dull.

Even the overall idea works pretty well, the way Palm Beach Story might have suggested in a more pioneering and hilarious way. But it seems to ride on the laurels of its stars and on the idea of being grandiose with a sexist wink. Very sexist. No thanks, not for 2010. Call it personal taste, but go into it forewarned.

It is very the first widescreen color flick in contemporary terms (not including Napoleon). And it has the arch qualities of a screwball comedy--improbable matchups and improbable circumstances.

The writing is pretty lame (not clever, not funny, just pushing silly buttons), and the acting is quite painful (though it might be purposely not an actor's film, but just a vehicle).

","genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance"},{"date":"28 August 2011","score":"","review":" Mike Nichols didn't earn my esteem. At least until I saw The Graduate. Locked and forgotten below movies such as Closer or Charlie Wilson's War, this one comes out very comic and surprisingly interesting. I pictured a annoying drama and a so-called comedy but maybe by accident, it ain't. The Graduate introduces you Benjamin Braddock (Dustin Hoffman). He's a twenty year-old who's just graduated and is very unsure about his future. His parents throw a party, inviting all their friends. Suddenly, a Mrs. Robinson (Anne Bancroft), married to a business partner of Ben's father, asks Ben to drive her home. Later at her home, she tries to seduce Ben. She eventually succeeds, but Ben falls in love... with her daughter(Katharine Ross). The topic is quite silly actually, but the movie is very enjoyable. A little less than two hours, though it could a little bit shorter, as it has one of the silliest endings of the story of the cinema. And I mean it. Dustin Hoffman does a very impressing job. Definitely my favourite between all his roles. Again, awesome music, that I think to have been written specifically to this movie, written by Paul Simon, performed by the same plus Art Garfunkel. It's very good. Go figure, its single knocked The Beatles' White Album out of the charts top. Won one Oscar for the directing, and earned three other nominations, for each of the three main actors. 8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"28 August 2011","score":"","review":" Mike Nichols didn't earn my esteem.
