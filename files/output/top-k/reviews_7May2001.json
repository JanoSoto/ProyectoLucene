There was alot of Indiana Jones...and I near died laughing when Rick and Evie were standing on the bow of the balloon-ship, (which I also don't understand.) Titanic, anyone?  And there was also the part with them running down a narrow hallway ahead of a torrent of rushing water.I could be wrong, but anyone who has ever played the computer game Diablo 2, by Blizzard Entertainment will swear that the little blowgun pygmy creatures, the creatures in the dark army, and the Rock-Scorpion king all have very obvious counter-parts in the game.I also enjoyed how the producers were able to get around The Rock's utter lack of acting talent by casting him in a role that does not require him to act.  Gotta love it.In short, this movie is not one that will go down as one of the great movies in history.

Terrible in every respect and unbearably hard to sit through.  What convinced Reeves to do this film?  It has a well-intentioned story, but it has no follow-through whatsoever.  The actors look bored with very little energy in their performances.  The Nuclear man is the lamest, repeat, lamest villian in this series, if not in any comic book movie. Other things that I noticed1.  They used the same flying shot of Superman (flying directly towards the camera) over NINE TIMES in the film (with different backdrops) 2.  Horrible continuity and editing.

I don't care who wrote it, I don't care who starred in it, and I don't care who directed it, if Ozzy hadn't been in Little Nicky, there would be absolutely no reason to watch it. Even the great Harvey Keitel, who obviously makes an excellent Satan, was ill-used if for no other reason than that idiotic deterioration that left him as nothing but a pair of arms and a mouth. Come on, people! Whose dumbass idea was that?! Anyway, Ozzy's was only one (by far the best one, mind you) of a whole series of cool cameos. We see a whole succession of great cameos in Little Nicky. Ozzy causes every rock and roll fan in the audience to jump up and cheer by biting the head off of the devil when he turns into a bat. Chubbs, Happy Gilmore's late, one-handed golf instructor shows up in a scene in heaven, along with Reese Witherspoon, who effectively plays the part of Little Nicky's angel mother who happens to also be an absolute bimbo. Rodney Dangerfield is his traditional self as the father of Satan (`Even in Hell I get no respect.'). John Lovitz has a scene early in the film where he sits in a tree spying on some woman while she changes, and he's listening to `Lady's Night,' the song that he performed in The Wedding Singer, which was obviously a much better film than this one. Even Dan Marino who, in my opinion, was made famous more by Ace Ventura than anything else, had a great part where he tries to sell his soul to the devil just to win a football game. And, of course, someone was amazingly able to get The Great Quentin Tarantino to play the part of a hideously creepy religious nut, in the second best cameo in the film (even Quentin can't compete with Ozzy). I could go on and on about the cool cameos in this movie.How about Little Nicky's room in Hell? What a great room for the son of the devil! Can I say something, by the way? The religious right attacks Marilyn Manson for every little thing he does, but I hereby officially bet any amount of money that no religious group on the planet will ever defend him by pointing out that there was not a single picture or poster of him in Nicky's room in Hell. You have to notice this when you see posters of Metallica, Ozzy (of course), Ministry, Motorhead, Korn, AC\/DC, Slipknot, Black Sabbath, etc. No one ever accused Korn of driving kids to worship the devil, yet the devil's son seems to be one of their biggest fans.There was a little too much cheesy comedy in this movie. And yes, I realize that it is a `Happy Madison' picture, and that these movies are characterized by their cheesy comedy. But the gigantic pineapple up Hitler was a step in the wrong direction. And how about that damn dog? Remember the scene where he shoots an arrow at Adrian, Nicky's evil brother? Of my GOD, that was ridiculous. And then there were John and Pete, a couple of idiot rock and roll fanatics that appear throughout the film in a series of dumbass scenes that make all rock and roll fans look bad. Although it was cool when one of them asks Nicky what was recorded backwards on Ozzy's record, and Nicky says that `the Blizzard' always delivered his message straight. Too bad they didn't use a Marilyn Manson song to do that, but as much as I respect him and love his music, he doesn't even come close to Ozzy. Little Nicky has a lot of cool stuff in it, such as an excellent soundtrack (notice the surprisingly good re-mix of Stupefy, by Disturbed, during the end credits), but most everything else is just pretty bad. And besides that, the soundtrack during the film was used as little more than to pack songs into the movie so that they could sell the soundtrack later, although some of the songs worked really well where they were put into the movie (Particularly Powerman 5000's `When Worlds Collide'). Little Nicky is sent to earth to capture his rebelling older brothers, because they escaped from hell, freezing the entrance and causing their father's deterioration. And then the Son of Satan meets some girl and falls in love with her! Everything about that little subplot was just awful, except for the way that he barely rescued her from the subway train late in the film, but it was actually a good decision to cast Patricia Arquette in this role. Except, remember when Nicky was explaining possession to her? `What do you mean, &#145;possessed?' Come on, Patricia, POSSESSION. Didn't you learn anything from starring in Stigmata? The plot of Little Nicky is of no value or interest whatsoever, it's the cameos that make it worth watching. Clearly, there can be no satisfaction derived from watching Adam Sandler's breathy performance as the son of Satan as he `releases the evil' and then `releases the good.' The plot and story are inconsequential, but the movie is still pretty funny at some points, so it's not a complete waste of time. It pays great homage to rock and roll stars as well as previous successful comedies, but if you're not a rock and roll fan or if you haven't seen a lot of these goofy comedies, you are almost sure to be disappointed by Little Nicky.

Cameron Diaz is an absolute bimbo in this movie, and although Drew Barrymore plays a relatively respectable character, her effectiveness isn't that great, especially given her whiny performances in such recent movies as Home Fries, Never Been Kissed, and The Wedding Singer. The biggest contribution that Drew made to this movie was getting her boyfriend to take a bit part in it.Despite the lack of creativity and the blatant sexual exploitation of Charlie's Angel's, there can be no denying the fact that it just had some good action and at least a few scenes that were really good. There was some fighting action that was really fun to watch, despite the fact that the cinematography was literally stolen from The Matrix, and let's not forget the fact that the Thin Man, with whom the angels had their first confrontation and who made surprisingly classy appearances throughout the film, was the guy who played George McFly in the great Back To The Future trilogy (well, part I and some of part II, anyway). Those are some of my favorite movies ever, and I haven't seen him in many other movies, so I thought it was really cool to see him in a movie again.Charlie's Angels is an un-creative action crime film that continuously and excessively exploits the hotties that star in it, and relies almost solely on their looks as well as some flashy music to push the movie along.

Those are some of my favorite movies ever, and I haven't seen him in many other movies, so I thought it was really cool to see him in a movie again.Charlie's Angels is an un-creative action crime film that continuously and excessively exploits the hotties that star in it, and relies almost solely on their looks as well as some flashy music to push the movie along. There can be no doubt about the fact that the music in the film was thrown in just to promote the soundtrack and make more money. There was hardly a second that went by that there wasn't another song playing, regardless of whether or not it had anything to do with what was happening on screen. There's so much trendy music packed into this movie that it almost overshadows everything else. Notice that they put that ridiculously popular Jennifer Lopez song (the title of which I don't know or care to know and, of course, by &#145;ridiculously popular,' I mean that it's ridiculous that it is popular) over the end credits. Some of the music was good, but it was poured on so thickly that it becomes cloying and suffocating. LL Cool J definitely said it best during the opening scene of the movie, `Walk out.'

After all, this is the not the type of film that would appeal to mainstream audiences, which is why I don't see why they fought hard to get the R rating.  This movie proved more popular among the arthouse crowd, who realize the haunting visions that Kubrick portrayed in this masterful effort.  What makes this movie so great is its unpredictability.  That's what distinguishes it from lots of the mainstream garbage that's been shoved down our throats.  Kubrick allows the audience to embark on these characters' weirdly fascinating journeys through this murky atmosphere in New York City.  This is not a sex film, like people so rudely judged it as.  Yes, it is quite rife with nudity, but it's all tastefully done, like something out of a Da Vinci painting.  Yes, it has some erotically charged moments, but never for tawdry purposes.  Kubrick helps create this atmosphere via creative lighting, and the score is absolutely brilliant ranging from symphonies that help capture the darkly comic moments to the striking piano chords that accentuate the eerie moments.  Kubrick is a master at creating hypnotic visions that suck viewers in and keep them watching with anticipation.  Viewing this movie for a second time, I was able to spot some flaws, but they're all superficial and very minor.  First of all, Kubrick shot the movie in England.  The story is set in New York.  He does his best to make it look a lot like New York and sometimes succeeds, but at other times fails.  In some scenes, Cruise is walking around at night, and you can see that the streets are clean and polished, and same with the sidewalks.  Anybody who's been to New York at night, or lived there, can spot the inaccuracy.  Those streets would've been filthy, crawling with rats and you would probably see more gangs and drug dealers in the background, whereas Cruise is often walking all-alone--unless a new supporting character is introduced.  Also, some of the very minor characters (Ex. The Waitress) are obviously hiding their English accents and doing a poor job.  I also felt some of the dialogue scenes could've been cut a tad shorter, and would've been more effective with visual aid.  For example, in the scene where Nicole Kidman describes the bad dream she just had, it would've been nice if we actually saw a dream sequence with her voice-over.Then again, the dialogue is one of the film's strong points.  About the only films that I feel strongly capture the way REAL people talk are this one and sex, lies and videotape.  In the scene where Cruise and Kidman are getting high, and Kidman reveals her dirty secret, they don't articulate what they're saying and seem to ramble on at points.  Because that's what people do when they're high!  And just like Soderbergh's masterpiece, the dialogue isn't literal, and you can tell what one of the characters is really trying to express through facial expressions, body language, etc.  This is another one of those movies that shows people don't always say what they're really thinking, and it's evident when that occurs.  Through this surreal journey, we're faced with many offbeat characters.  This sets the film's different tones of black comedy (the incident in the costume shop), drama (the mysterious hooker) and Hitchcockian suspense (the orgy scene).  Best of all, Kubrick leaves an area of mystery in each scene, allowing different interpretations from different minds.  You don't always FIND OUT why the conflicts arise in this movie!  And that's the beauty.  It leaves you thinking and gives your imagination something to do.  The whole movie has this haunting, mystical aura that just draws you in from beginning to end.  Yes, it's 2 hours and 40 minutes long, but I hardly realized the running time being that I was so wrapped up.  Never once does it fall flat, never once is it boring, never once does the intrigue fade out. Although, I fell in love with this movie the first time around, I think others might need to watch it a second time and looks beyond the surface.  As I said before, this is not a sex film!  This is a movie about lust, deception, temptation, jealousy and every other emotion that would arise from Cruise's character in this situation.  He has just learned about his wife's past sexual affair, and some think that it was a little far-fetched how Cruise reacted in that situation, but I think relationships can be flaming with jealousy--whether they're overreacting or not, it just happens.  People lose control of their emotions, and just like Cruise they get plagued by monstrous visions.  In his case, he kept seeing her in bed with the guy from the Navy.  Why he chooses to embark on this unpredictable sexual journey is not exactly expressed on screen.  Once again leaving the audience free to think what his motives might be.  It can be jealousy, it can be something else.  You never know.  Not every situation is entirely realistic, but they weren't meant to be.  This was meant to play like a dream\/nightmare that Cruise goes through, roaming the streets of NY at night and bumping into suspicious characters left and right, sometimes putting himself in danger.  Meanwhile, visions of his wife with another man continue to haunt him.I'm almost sure that Kubrick fans will appraise this virtual masterpiece.  His perfectionism really shows in every scene of this movie.  And it pays off great.  Steven Spielberg said, What's great about Kubrick's films is they're never the same.  All his movies have something different to offer.  So is the case with Eyes Wide Shut.  It's like nothing you've ever seen, even through Kubrick's eyes.

Yes, it is quite rife with nudity, but it's all tastefully done, like something out of a Da Vinci painting.  Yes, it has some erotically charged moments, but never for tawdry purposes.  Kubrick helps create this atmosphere via creative lighting, and the score is absolutely brilliant ranging from symphonies that help capture the darkly comic moments to the striking piano chords that accentuate the eerie moments.  Kubrick is a master at creating hypnotic visions that suck viewers in and keep them watching with anticipation.  Viewing this movie for a second time, I was able to spot some flaws, but they're all superficial and very minor.  First of all, Kubrick shot the movie in England.  The story is set in New York.  He does his best to make it look a lot like New York and sometimes succeeds, but at other times fails.  In some scenes, Cruise is walking around at night, and you can see that the streets are clean and polished, and same with the sidewalks.  Anybody who's been to New York at night, or lived there, can spot the inaccuracy.  Those streets would've been filthy, crawling with rats and you would probably see more gangs and drug dealers in the background, whereas Cruise is often walking all-alone--unless a new supporting character is introduced.  Also, some of the very minor characters (Ex. The Waitress) are obviously hiding their English accents and doing a poor job.  I also felt some of the dialogue scenes could've been cut a tad shorter, and would've been more effective with visual aid.  For example, in the scene where Nicole Kidman describes the bad dream she just had, it would've been nice if we actually saw a dream sequence with her voice-over.Then again, the dialogue is one of the film's strong points.  About the only films that I feel strongly capture the way REAL people talk are this one and sex, lies and videotape.  In the scene where Cruise and Kidman are getting high, and Kidman reveals her dirty secret, they don't articulate what they're saying and seem to ramble on at points.  Because that's what people do when they're high!  And just like Soderbergh's masterpiece, the dialogue isn't literal, and you can tell what one of the characters is really trying to express through facial expressions, body language, etc.  This is another one of those movies that shows people don't always say what they're really thinking, and it's evident when that occurs.  Through this surreal journey, we're faced with many offbeat characters.  This sets the film's different tones of black comedy (the incident in the costume shop), drama (the mysterious hooker) and Hitchcockian suspense (the orgy scene).  Best of all, Kubrick leaves an area of mystery in each scene, allowing different interpretations from different minds.  You don't always FIND OUT why the conflicts arise in this movie!  And that's the beauty.  It leaves you thinking and gives your imagination something to do.  The whole movie has this haunting, mystical aura that just draws you in from beginning to end.  Yes, it's 2 hours and 40 minutes long, but I hardly realized the running time being that I was so wrapped up.  Never once does it fall flat, never once is it boring, never once does the intrigue fade out. Although, I fell in love with this movie the first time around, I think others might need to watch it a second time and looks beyond the surface.  As I said before, this is not a sex film!  This is a movie about lust, deception, temptation, jealousy and every other emotion that would arise from Cruise's character in this situation.  He has just learned about his wife's past sexual affair, and some think that it was a little far-fetched how Cruise reacted in that situation, but I think relationships can be flaming with jealousy--whether they're overreacting or not, it just happens.  People lose control of their emotions, and just like Cruise they get plagued by monstrous visions.  In his case, he kept seeing her in bed with the guy from the Navy.  Why he chooses to embark on this unpredictable sexual journey is not exactly expressed on screen.  Once again leaving the audience free to think what his motives might be.  It can be jealousy, it can be something else.  You never know.  Not every situation is entirely realistic, but they weren't meant to be.  This was meant to play like a dream\/nightmare that Cruise goes through, roaming the streets of NY at night and bumping into suspicious characters left and right, sometimes putting himself in danger.  Meanwhile, visions of his wife with another man continue to haunt him.I'm almost sure that Kubrick fans will appraise this virtual masterpiece.  His perfectionism really shows in every scene of this movie.  And it pays off great.  Steven Spielberg said, What's great about Kubrick's films is they're never the same.  All his movies have something different to offer.  So is the case with Eyes Wide Shut.  It's like nothing you've ever seen, even through Kubrick's eyes.  His legacy will always be remembered, and so will this as a successful final chapter in a great filmmaker's life.My score  9 (out of 10)           ","genre":"Drama, Mystery, Thriller"}]
