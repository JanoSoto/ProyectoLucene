A man who was self aware enough to stop himself on the road to fruitless life soon enough to turn around and straighten his life out.

With that in mind, I will begin with the pros.  The Music  The sound score is so overwhelmingly brilliant it adds just the right air of classical Victorian mixed with a tenor of dominating intrigue.  It is not as well mixed as the sound-score for Interview w\/t Vampire but is definately one of my favorites. Gary Oldman's acting is the best rendition of Dracula to date.  His accent is flawless and he is politely charming and menacing all at once.  In all...his finest performance.  He can only be upstaged by Anthony Hopkins who is the first actor to ADEQUATELY portray the role of Van Helsing.  If you are familiar with the novel than you know that Hopkins' version stands truer to form than any other.  The cinematagraphy is the most amazing I have ever seen.  The camera angles, the lighting, the zoom-effects and the movement tricks are handled with such chaotic harmony that they are almost poetic.  Truly original and creative filming.  Renfield is truly the pitiable maniac that he is meant to be.  A sane man fighting for his soul. I can not offer this movie enough praise.  Every time I watch it, it scares the Hell out of me.  But...its not perfect. Alas...the cons. Keanu Reeves????????????  What were they thinking?  Why don't they get Boris Karloff?  I think Karloff could do a better acting job from the grave than Reeves did.  Reeves' performance did all but massacre the integrity of the story.  His British accent is so forced and inconsistent that it is pathetically laughable. Another bad element of the story  We seem to have gone a little overboard with the costume concepts.  Yes...I know Dracula is supposed to be a blonde. And yes I know that he should be expected to wear the cultural garb of a Wallachian Boyar.  But he was just a little too frilly and ridiculous looking.  I mean...how damn long does your cape have to be?  It's a wonder he wasn't tripping and stumbling all over the place. Lastly....a little bit of clarification.  Many people believe that Dracula is supposed to be some kind of Romantic tale set within a Gothic atmosphere. It's not.  Read Stoker's novel.  His seduction of Mina is not about Romance.  It's about power.  Pure and Simple.  One human being exerting his power over another.  It is rape. Except in this instance it is not the raping of something relatively unimportant such as a person's body.  It is a rape of the soul and that is far worse and certainly not romantic.  Mina acts in ways that are completely uncharacteristic.  She is showed as being way to prim and proper to ever cheat on her husband to be with some stranger.  Dracula dominates her entirely.  She is not seduced or corrupted but completely overpowered.  Be careful not to confuse that dominative aspect of his villainy with passion or seduction.  It's not about that at all. The film...the novel...the lore...the history...the franchise.  All excellent.  Watch the film.

If the answer is 'yes' to any of the above then chances are you're               addicted to this cult 1987 movie starring Richard E Grant.If you're a newcomer, then you'll probably be wondering what all the fuss is about so here's the lowdown It centres on a couple of out of work thesps, Withnail (Grant) and Peter Marwood (Paul McGann), struggling to make ends meet during the late Sixties.Marwood is a thinly veiled version of Robinson, a reflection of the days when he was a handsome young actor perhaps best known for his work on Franco Zeffirelli's Romeo and Juliet. The character of Withnail is based on Bruce's late housemate Vivian MacKerrell, an outrageous drunk who Robinson described as A wild aristocratic figure, highly educated.Robinson never achieved star status but went on to make a living as a scriptwriter. When The Killing Fields landed him an Oscar in 1986, Withnail and I got the green light and Bruce made his debut as director.The star of the movie is a first class coward with delusions of grandeur and a drink problem so severe he'll down a can of lighter fluid in order to get a fix - on the day of the shoot, the production team substituted the can's contents for vinegar, a fact unknown to Grant, which probably explains his stunned reaction.As research, the director had his two leads go out and get drunk so they would have a chemical memory of what it was like for future reference. Grant, a devout tee-totaller, was prepared to suffer for his art and gave the performance of his life.It may have cost next to nothing to make but the aftermath of Withnail was staggering. Jobbing thesp Grant suddenly became one of Hollywood's favourite 'English' actors - the fact that he was born in Swaziland seemed to pass most movie bosses by.On the strength of this he went on to work with some of the world's finest film-makers including Martin Scorsese (The Age of Innocence); Robert Altman (The Player) and Francis Ford Coppola (Bram Stoker's Dracula).

His Withnail follow-up, How To Get Ahead In Advertising, was an ingenious flop while US directorial debut Jennifer 8 was torn apart by the studio that backed it.These days he continues writing screenplays such as In Dreams (another costly flop) and the little-seen drama Return To Paradise.However, things seem to have gone full circle as Robinson recently made a return to acting and gives a knockout performance as an ageing rock star in recent video release Still Crazy.As with all cult movies, Withnail and I is choc full of quotable one liners, many of them uttered by Uncle Monty (Richard Griffiths) and Danny. Once heard, who could forget the immortal As a youth I used to weep in butchers' shops,? Or Danny's comment on the follically challenged I don't advise a haircut, man. All hairdressers are in the employment of the government.Hairs are your aerials. They pick up signals from the cosmos, and transmit them directly into the brain. This is the reason bald-headed men are uptight.

When she apprised him of the facts, he killed her too.Mmm hmm.So Karl spends twenty-five years in the state mental institution and then they let him go. He has improved himself and learned to read. He's read the Bible and he reckons he understands it, mostly. He meets a boy and they become best buds showering one another and the audience with idiot savant and precocious child bits of phony wisdom. Sometimes it gets so corny you just want to blush for the players. This is not to say that the script has no redeeming qualities. It does, especially the first, last and penultimate scenes-and there are some nice touches in between. But overall it's heavy-handed and insufferably preachy.The main problem is Billy Bob himself, who also wrote the script and directed. If it can be said that the man who acts as his own lawyer has an idiot for a client, then perhaps it can be said that the star who directs himself has no guidance as an actor. Thornton's performance (upper lip buried in lower, dead pan voice, etc.) is more mannerism than substance. In the beginning he had the timing down very well when Karl was saying little, but later on when Karl started dispensing all that wisdom, he had to talk faster and it started to come out phony. There's a great temptation, when writing of the down-trodden to cover ourselves with them, like the flag, and unabashedly champion the underdogs of society without regard for reality. When that happens we have a political movie, an I'm in favor of motherhood editorial instead of a film. Thornton falls into this trap as he attempts to catapult the second class citizens of our society halfway to sainthood over the straw body of bigots and the usual small town mentality. Consequently, both Karl and the boy become far too wise, too sensitive, too considerate, too loving and frankly, too saintly to be believed.I'm not sure that anything could have allowed this movie to live up to the PC adoration given it, but Thornton might have helped his cause by cutting some of Karl's more goody-goody pronouncements, and by giving more time and scope to the other characters, especially the boy's mother (Natalie Canerday) who is too narrowly presented. He had a very fine cast he should have used them more and himself less.Dwight Yoakam was properly despicable as the insufferably self-centered, woman-battering, bigoted boyfriend of the boy's mother. John Ritter was close to brilliant as a small town, thirtysomething gay. J.T. Walsh, as a psychopathic rapist\/murderer, was sardonically humorous, and Robert Duvall's cameo as Karl's falling-down poor white trash father was good (as far as it went). Lucas Black, who played the boy was excellent. In short, the cast carried the film, and if Thornton had given them more depth and himself less he might have had a work of art.(Note Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!

I gave this  movie a 1 and hope that Cruise and Kidman do better  in choosing scripts in the future and forget about  making art films.

How many movie directors in history have successfully tackled so many different cultures in so few films such a short time? The hilarious present day comedy Wedding Banquet included New York and Taiwanese characters. Sense and Sensibility was an early 19th century British costume drama treated in a fresh style. The Ice Storm looked at troubled middle class New England families in 1973. Now we have a very unusual American Civil War drama. It is not about conventional battles between large professionally organised armies. This is messy guerilla warfare on the Missouri\/Kansas border. As Lee obviously understands, professional soldiers have always detested amateur partisan bands far more than their professional opponents on the other side of the battlelines who fight in conventional ways. Spanish guerillas fighting Napoleon in the 1800s, Irish freedom fighters against the British Army in the 1920s, Italian and Yugoslav partisans against the Germans in the 1940s and the Vietcong in the 1960s all incited ferocious countermeasures. The military professionals HATE these small forces who come out of the woods and mountains, deliver sudden ambushes and melt back into their native terrain like shadows. In Ride with the Devil the savagery of this style of warfare is increased by the fact that families and communities were split down the middle over the question of slavery, with regional and racial loyalties being muddled in unpredictable ways. Lee is prepared to focus nearly all the story's attention on a Confederate band whose views on slavery and race relations will be completely anathema to most modern audiences. We are allowed to see them as human beings who are desperate to defend their families and their way of life against the alien Yankees. The poignancy of their sacrifices is compounded by our knowing that they are on the losing side and that they are dying heroically to defend an utterly unjust way of life.Yet they are also shown as ruthless predators who are prepared to kill all the men in a community and destroy all their homes and property. In contrast, the enemy women are carefully spared, even when their husbands are murdered in front of them. The merciless invaders treat the ladies with old-world courtesy. But any softness in sparing even a grandfather and his young grandson is viewed as a suspicious sign of weakness and potential treason.I cannot praise the virtues of this unusual drama too highly the outstanding performances from a largely unknown (though Oscar-caliber) cast, the beautiful cinematography, the set and costume design and the overall FEEL for the period. Unlike most historical  filmmakers, Lee understands that the past is not another time - it practically another planet, whose inhabitants' attitudes may be almost incomprehensible to 1990s man. He depicts the brutality of warfare as convincingly as Saving Private Ryan, though without that film's excessive length and preposterous plot contrivances. The scene where a wounded warrior's arm has to be amputated (without anaesthetic or medical care) because the gangrene is advancing up to his armpit is almost unwatchable. Yet Lee does not need to show us all the gruesome details which Spielberg insists on shoving in our faces.Most fascinating of all are its small details which you will probably never see in another movie. The hero is from the German-American community. Although they are the largest ethnic minority in America, you practically never see the Germans mentioned in movies, unlike the Irish, Jews, Italians, Africans and so on. The hero is a virgin on his wedding night - when did you last see THAT! The female lead breastfeeds her child; when did you last see the breast used as anything, but a sex toy?Most highly recommended - 9 out of 10.

I can also see how Chinatown is talking about the world we live in today, in a sense that in a world that is corrupt and laden with deceit and mystery, a hopeful outcome will never be.

Jack Pierce is the wizard of Hollywood make up and the transformations are so well done that they are even comparable to modern (pre-CGI) FX.  Claude Raines delivers a superb perfomance as Sir John and Maria Ouspen.a..ie..ouka...oh... MALEVA adds just the right amount of creepiness to give the film its exotic feel.  Beleive it or not there is actually a moral and cautionary tale to this story.  The moral is about neglect.  Neglect to one's values and the consequences thereof.

How can Hollywood produce these things?  Who gives producers and directors the money?  The movie promissed something, in the beginning, but one knew, after only 10 minutes, that it would turn out to be of the most idiotic things produced by Hollywood.  I made the mistake of buying the video, after all, I had not seen the movie. Big mistake. Every once in a while I make one...      It´s a shame to see William Hurt and Gary Oldman in such a terrible thing. If doubts existed about the competence (or lack of it) of Hopkins (the director), they were all cleared. The man shouldn´t direct a comercial, let alone a movie...  The special effects seemed more appropriate for a cartoon than for a movie...  The plot is a joke. The characters seemed to have been designed by a madman...  Please, if you haven´t yet seen this movie, don´t. It´s...it´s...  You´ll get sick if you see it.
