All good topics for parents to discuss with their kids (except the last one) but not topics I want in a comedy for teens! Considering that MTV has brought us THE REAL WORLD(?) and many other sexually obsessed shows in recent years, perhaps I shouldn't have been so surprised, but I still am highly offended at the marketing--it should have been marketed towards adults.Now for adult audiences, this is an excellent film--full of very dark humor and great characters. Considering that I am a high school teacher myself, I really enjoyed laughing at the broad characters--the incredibly perfect but seriously flawed over-achiever, the dumb but sweet jock, etc. About the only part that made me uncomfortable was the teacher who had sex with one of the students.

It is not always about a product that sums things up in a tidy sentence or a two hour film. It is possible to criticize this film based on the conventions of the medium, but thats besides the point. Sure the stalker is the only fleshed out character, but the writer and the scientist are not even supposed to be characters to begin with. I think its fairly obvious they are archetypes that represent a conflict. Some people have said that the science versus religion thing is tired, this is missing the point completely!!!! Its the absurdity of trying to reduce any conflict to a duality to begin with. The scene where we observe them sitting together makes it all very clear. We are observing them from the very room itself, where our innermost desires are laid bare and revealed. With this insight we can see that there is no duality to begin with, but only different ways to strive towards an understanding, the characters are joined together, their separation dissolves. Someone mentioned that this film is straining for deepness, and many a viewer will constantly feel this strain. They seemed a little confused because most films strain for this, as do most people!!!!! A successful film will always have this strain because that is part of our existence. Stalker evokes that yearning and allows us to feel it, and that is one of its best qualities I think. To actual visually embody the yearning for meaning, thats what A.T. has done here.Stalker vs. Solaris Another point of contention on IMDb, Most people seem to like a Solaris more...all I will say is this Solaris is much more obvious and much more straightforward. I guess people find it easier, but in its supposed humanism its actually quite sterile, its clean. It presents human problems but through a haze of greatness that you will find with a lot of art. Its filmed from a further distance is what I am trying to say.Stalker is the down and dirty, the swamp, the overgrowth, insects, water, rotting, rust. Its a much more dynamic world, just like our striving is much more dynamic than duality. Its dark, confusing, musty, a little frightening, but extremely beautiful. I would like to mention the use of the word pretentious. If you have you used the word pretentious in your review please read a dictionary and understand a word before you use it. That word is used constantly to instantly demonize something. It is the equivalent of calling someone an anti-semite. It is loaded and works against serious discussion and observation. THIS FILM IS NOT PRETENTIOUS BECAUSE IT DOES NOT ATTEMPT TO IMPRESS OR HOLD ANY GREAT IMPORTANCE!!!!!!! It just exists as it does and its people afterwords that attach importance to it.

I believe wholeheartedly that It's just the most extraordinary and influential film i've ever seen. the most strange thing about this film is that it doesn't really state who's good and who's bad.The film is directed in 1982 by my favourite director Ridley Scott & it's about future life. it's not innovative, but it's just shocking. The action takes place in LA , in November( my sweet month=\/ ) and the main point is humanity VS non-humanity. it's about poor replicantsThe replicants are artificial humans, indistinguishable from the real thing in every way but two they have no memories, and they have lifespans of only four years. at the beginning i thought that they had no sense too, but i was absolutely wrong.. they have sense, therefore they have wishes, and only wish they have is right to live more than their limited life gives them chance.Deckard is the main character. he is a retired Blade Runner, but then he's forced back from retirement and it's his job to terminate them.I like Sean Young too much, she plays Rachel, Tyrell's assistant.

His cerebral experiments with character and narrative in the 1960's with films such as The Silence (1963), Persona (1966) and A Passion (1968) are still as relevant and interesting today as his more conventional art films of the 1950's, of which Smiles of a Summer Night (1955), The Seventh Seal (1957) and Wild Strawberries (1957) are the most iconic and best known. He continued to make staggering films far into the 70's as well, long after many of his closest contemporaries had submitted to self-parody and over indulgence, and was still able to produce great work like Cries and Whispers (1972), Scenes from a Marriage (1973) and Face to Face (1976) even when working within the incredibly limiting confines of Swedish television.With this in mind, Fanny and Alexander (1982) would seem to be the culmination of everything that Bergman had been working towards throughout his entire career; with many of the themes, ideas, ghosts and characters that had appeared and reappeared not only in his work but also in his life and childhood being written into the script and presented on the screen. We also get many of the same narrative and thematic preoccupations here too; with innocence, death, ghosts, dreams, childhood and infidelity all featuring heavily, and with everything further cross-referenced to the films that came before. This isn't particularly surprising, since Bergman's work was always self-referential, but what does impress with this is the bold use of light, sound, design and composition, giving us bold and glowing colour where there was once iconic black and white and an enormous amount of vibrant movement where there was once static, highly rigid examination.Another impressive factor is Bergman's intelligent, self-reflexive use of narrative framing, which not only works in relation to the film and the characters therein, but in the presentation of his own life and the semi-autobiographical allusions made in the script. So, with Fanny and Alexander we have the presentation of a play within a play within a film. One play is created by Alexander, whilst the other play is created by Shakespeare, recreated by the adults and filmed by Bergman. In general, there are a lot of references made to plays and the theatre - which is very much fitting given the fact that it was Bergman's great love - with continual references made towards Hamlet, Macbeth and the work of Charles Dickens. We also have the more clear-cut, autobiographical aspect of Bergman as Alexander, the would-be storyteller and narrator of the film itself, giving us the obvious representation of innocence submitting to adulthood and warm nostalgia.The key scene for me here, the one where the ideas of the film take flight and offer the viewer something truly magical, is the sequence wherein Fanny and Alexander stay with the Jewish money-lender. The imagery here is startling and eases us into the second half of the drama in which the vaguely supernatural elements begin to accumulate, either as a result of Alexander's burgeoning imagination or as a result of the continual meta-textual reference points to the play within a play. Certainly, it may be less concise and iconic than The Seventh Seal, or seemingly less experimental than Persona, but it is still, without question, amongst the very greatest European films of the 20th century; filled to the brim with intelligent ideas, raw emotions, fun and frivolity, grand spectacle, beautiful colours, Gothic melodrama, ghosts and apparitions, music and movement and, as thus, is clearly one of Bergman's most intelligent, imaginative and visually impressive films.Although he would go in to direct numerous projects for television - including the celebrated follow up to Scenes from a Marriage, Sarabande (2003) - Fanny and Alexander remains Bergman's ultimate final word as a filmmaker, and is a wonderful culmination of the themes and ideas that had been slowly gathering and evolving throughout his impressive and distinguished career.

We also have the more clear-cut, autobiographical aspect of Bergman as Alexander, the would-be storyteller and narrator of the film itself, giving us the obvious representation of innocence submitting to adulthood and warm nostalgia.The key scene for me here, the one where the ideas of the film take flight and offer the viewer something truly magical, is the sequence wherein Fanny and Alexander stay with the Jewish money-lender. The imagery here is startling and eases us into the second half of the drama in which the vaguely supernatural elements begin to accumulate, either as a result of Alexander's burgeoning imagination or as a result of the continual meta-textual reference points to the play within a play. Certainly, it may be less concise and iconic than The Seventh Seal, or seemingly less experimental than Persona, but it is still, without question, amongst the very greatest European films of the 20th century; filled to the brim with intelligent ideas, raw emotions, fun and frivolity, grand spectacle, beautiful colours, Gothic melodrama, ghosts and apparitions, music and movement and, as thus, is clearly one of Bergman's most intelligent, imaginative and visually impressive films.Although he would go in to direct numerous projects for television - including the celebrated follow up to Scenes from a Marriage, Sarabande (2003) - Fanny and Alexander remains Bergman's ultimate final word as a filmmaker, and is a wonderful culmination of the themes and ideas that had been slowly gathering and evolving throughout his impressive and distinguished career.

It starts by throwing us straight into the story with Mattew Broderick (Steven) living in a new apartment after we learn that he has recently separated (tempararily) from his girlfriend Robyn. Then comes Jim Carrey as Chip Douglas, the strange yet harmless cable guy who gives Steven free cable. From then on, he becomes more and more infatuated with Steven and wanting to become his friend, the scene in the Cable van sticks in my mind where Chip is touched by the fact that Steven has asked him what his name is. It only emphasises his loneliness. After a tricky start, everything seems to be going well for Chip and he feels like he's found a friend in Steven before he finds out that the girl at his Karaoke party (which includes some hilarious scenes) who he slept with was in fact a prostitute hired by Chip. This sharply turns everything round for their friendship and Chip is told to leave immediately. This fires Chip in to wanting to make it up to Steven and he even patches up his relationship with Robyn for him but despite this, Steven still feels there's something not quite right about Chip and tells him that he doesn't want to be his friend in a really well acted scene by both Broderick and Carrey. This next turn fires Chip into another direction, a revenge scheme. He uses devious ways to interfere with Steven's life such as turning him into the police for accepting his stolen goods such as the huge plasma TV and Jukebox system. He visits him in prison and hilariously parodies The Midnight Express while also informing him that he's going to 'take care' of Robyn in more great dark acting from Carrey. Once Steven gets bail, Chip then loses him his job and mixes with his family while ever getting closer to Robyn who starts leaning towards Chip rather than Steven and starts to worry over Steven's change of personality. What ensues is the climax of the film in where Chip could truly change Steven's life forever and his own in a superbly acted, and also slightly moving ending. Throughout the film there is also a running back-plot which is revealed at the end and finalises with a great twist which adds to the films quality of story.To summarise, I'll start with the often slated performance of Jim Carrey. Carrey is one of my favourite comic actors but he's not only that..he's got a lot more in his locker than that and this film proves his amazing talent as an actor rather than just a zany comedian. He really does perform the character of Chip fantastically well, the loneliness and pain inside him is acted so well and at the same time is funny throughout the film. One of my favourite scenes of the film is where he leaves about 10 messages on Steven's answer phone..its funny and yet makes you really feel sorry for him at the same time. When you start feeling sorry for a character and really seeing his personality traits shine through as well as Chip's in this...you know that he's put in a great performance. So what if he's not Lloyd Christmas or Ace Ventura (Great though they are) anymore...this is something new. Something different, a new character with more too him. An edge, the creepiness, the loneliness, the strange and dark humour he has. Its a really fine performance off Carrey which is so underrated by many. Matthew Broderick also performs really well as the 'straight guy' of the film, his baby face and soft voice plus good acting really give across the feeling of Steven being a nice guy, just a genuine, helpful and thoughtful to others kind of guy. This unfortunately for him is seen by Chip who uses it and takes advantage of it. The supporting actors also play their part and its actually really well directed by Ben Stiller whose only other film I've seen (which he's directed) was Zoolander which I thought was awful. The comedy is also great in the film and isn't lost and combined with the extra edge is amazing. The only real problem or improvement that could of been made was more flashback scenes to further explore his upbringing rather than one scene being used to explain for Chip's behaviour and state of mind. Highly underrated by many, as I said before, people need to stop singling out Carrey's performance and comparing it to his other comedy films and think of it as an independent film and they should see that its not as bad as they thought. Carrey was huge in 96 (the $20 million pay cheque is only proof) and they were obviously expecting another flat out wacky comedy from the comedy man that is Jim Carrey. They weren't open to the fact that he has a lot more range in his acting ability. He's gone on to prove it many more times in films such as The Truman Show, The Majestic, Man on the Moon and The Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind etc. This was just maybe the first real sign of that acting ability and people weren't used to it and couldn't adapt to it. People who don't like change and would of preferred another Ace Ventura following from the appalling Nature Calls (1995). I loved it and I'm glad I gave it a chance. Directed well, superb acting, funny, has got an edge, creepy, dark, moving...a truly unique comedy film which is badly underrated.

Such is the power and the eeriness of this film, it was not until a few days after I had seen it that the film began to strike a cord with me. Yes, I saw it; really enjoyed it and when the climactic scene came and went, it was heart breaking but at the time I could not accept that it had just happened. Fast forward three or four days later, re-visit the theme tune as produced by Myers\/Williams and actually think about what had transpired and it is a shocking and unpleasant feeling that dawns on you.The Deer Hunter at its very core is an obvious commentary on how the Vietnam War as a whole destroyed the people who fought in it. The film is about how the war arrived just when so many people were getting in right and were enjoying themselves without a care in the world right until something as unnecessary and as brutal as the war comes along to destroy it. When Michael (De Niro), Steven (Calzale) and Nick (Walken) finish their front line duty in 'Nam, their lives are changed; so much so that despite being home or at least within the boundaries of a space that is not the war itself, they cannot or find it difficult to re-adapt &#150; Nick for psychological reasons, Steven for physical reasons and Michael just about gets by, but he is still haunted by the actions of his clumsy and now apparent immature friends.And so it is at this point that I give an opinion that will seem insulting and derogatory but is just a humble observation; The Deer Hunter viewed now, structurally, resembles that nasty little horror sub-genre called 'torture porn'. Maybe it is the recent spate of films of this sub-genre, but The Deer Hunter begins with utopia (at least for the characters) before descending into Hell and then ending with a reprieve as well as having to come to terms with what has happened once you were dragged from your utopian haven. For the first third, the characters that are the steel workers are happy and carefree with frequent trips to the bar and jokes with fellow co-workers the enjoyable level of their lives. This sequence feels warm and it feels friendly, lulling us into a false sense. Then there is the wedding; supposedly the happiest moment of anybody's life and once again, the dizziest high achievable is shown and exploited in the opening third &#150; it can only go down from here. Then there is the eerie way Nick and Michael seem to gamble; they gamble on the football game on TV but they gamble with their lives when they undertake a truck on the road &#150; this toying with fate and their lives echoes in future scenes, but it will mature them in the nastiest way possible.There is also the attitude the characters have toward the wedding; this is where The Deer Hunter edges toward the brink of being political. The manner in which the guys fool around and treat a big deal like the wedding in such a carefree manner might be echoing America's methods of dealing with the Vietnam War; 'underestimation' the key word here. But this works both ways, it can be a political statement but it can also act as a brilliant sentimental set up. I especially liked the scenes in which the guys sing to the music and play pool at the same time; it is something most men have done, play pool, whilst the apparent unnecessary action may be questioned; after later events it is something the guys will not be able to partake in ever again &#150; enjoy it and do not question it while it lasts because one day, it may be an impossibility.Then onto the second act and the war itself in which buildings are eviscerated and people are killed. Michael must torch someone alive with a flamethrower and march about seeing other such Americans lie in waste as a result of gunfights. But the capture and the subsequent 'torture' of the protagonists is what people remember the film for. The scenes work because you don't want these characters to be slapped about, treated this way and be shot. True, the 'evil' Vietnamese and the 'good' and innocent Americans are categorised here but I do not feel the representation can be criticised if it is a war zone in which the events are set, with two sides warring with one another. This roulette sequence important because it plays a large role in Nick's future mentality; the scene when he breaks down in hospital is perhaps a realisation of what he went through and for some reason, he must constantly face these demons in future roulette games.When said people do make it home, it is not the fun and games it was. Axel (Aspegren) and Stan (Cazale) are waiting there, no surprise the film did not bring the two least likable guys along with them to the war, and no surprise Michael gets agitated with them when he does, especially when Stan shows off his revolver. The Deer Hunter further intrudes into the political when it includes, I believe to be, real life images and footage of news reports during the war amongst the action. But the film will remain strong and haunting enough for time to age it in that powerful and important manner.

The film is about how the war arrived just when so many people were getting in right and were enjoying themselves without a care in the world right until something as unnecessary and as brutal as the war comes along to destroy it. When Michael (De Niro), Steven (Calzale) and Nick (Walken) finish their front line duty in 'Nam, their lives are changed; so much so that despite being home or at least within the boundaries of a space that is not the war itself, they cannot or find it difficult to re-adapt &#150; Nick for psychological reasons, Steven for physical reasons and Michael just about gets by, but he is still haunted by the actions of his clumsy and now apparent immature friends.And so it is at this point that I give an opinion that will seem insulting and derogatory but is just a humble observation; The Deer Hunter viewed now, structurally, resembles that nasty little horror sub-genre called 'torture porn'. Maybe it is the recent spate of films of this sub-genre, but The Deer Hunter begins with utopia (at least for the characters) before descending into Hell and then ending with a reprieve as well as having to come to terms with what has happened once you were dragged from your utopian haven. For the first third, the characters that are the steel workers are happy and carefree with frequent trips to the bar and jokes with fellow co-workers the enjoyable level of their lives. This sequence feels warm and it feels friendly, lulling us into a false sense. Then there is the wedding; supposedly the happiest moment of anybody's life and once again, the dizziest high achievable is shown and exploited in the opening third &#150; it can only go down from here. Then there is the eerie way Nick and Michael seem to gamble; they gamble on the football game on TV but they gamble with their lives when they undertake a truck on the road &#150; this toying with fate and their lives echoes in future scenes, but it will mature them in the nastiest way possible.There is also the attitude the characters have toward the wedding; this is where The Deer Hunter edges toward the brink of being political. The manner in which the guys fool around and treat a big deal like the wedding in such a carefree manner might be echoing America's methods of dealing with the Vietnam War; 'underestimation' the key word here. But this works both ways, it can be a political statement but it can also act as a brilliant sentimental set up. I especially liked the scenes in which the guys sing to the music and play pool at the same time; it is something most men have done, play pool, whilst the apparent unnecessary action may be questioned; after later events it is something the guys will not be able to partake in ever again &#150; enjoy it and do not question it while it lasts because one day, it may be an impossibility.Then onto the second act and the war itself in which buildings are eviscerated and people are killed. Michael must torch someone alive with a flamethrower and march about seeing other such Americans lie in waste as a result of gunfights. But the capture and the subsequent 'torture' of the protagonists is what people remember the film for. The scenes work because you don't want these characters to be slapped about, treated this way and be shot. True, the 'evil' Vietnamese and the 'good' and innocent Americans are categorised here but I do not feel the representation can be criticised if it is a war zone in which the events are set, with two sides warring with one another. This roulette sequence important because it plays a large role in Nick's future mentality; the scene when he breaks down in hospital is perhaps a realisation of what he went through and for some reason, he must constantly face these demons in future roulette games.When said people do make it home, it is not the fun and games it was. Axel (Aspegren) and Stan (Cazale) are waiting there, no surprise the film did not bring the two least likable guys along with them to the war, and no surprise Michael gets agitated with them when he does, especially when Stan shows off his revolver. The Deer Hunter further intrudes into the political when it includes, I believe to be, real life images and footage of news reports during the war amongst the action. But the film will remain strong and haunting enough for time to age it in that powerful and important manner.

The cut's new visual effects work to transition previously awkward story arcs, but can't entirely solve the at times ponderously over-told story of an alien probe in pursuit of earth.Claustrophobic performances by William Shatner et al seem all too conscious of and intimidated by the movie's grand scale, with each character working too hard to create dramatic ennui with each line. The results, at times, seem like heavy-handed direction. ONly as the film nears its end do we begin to see the regular Trek personalities emerge - but by then, the movie's almost over.

Here, director Neil Jordan skilfully manages to structure his film around a series of intricate character studies, metaphorical iconography and a plot that is never less than enthralling. Jordan, whose previous film was The Company of Wolves (1984), an adaptation of Angela Carter's meta-textual cross-reference of Little Red Riding Hood and the sexual awakening of a young woman, seems obsessed with the codes and conventions of fairy tales. Here, perverted and moved to a modern day setting, Bob Hoskins plays George, a little red riding hood-type figure, lured into a labyrinth of illicit sex and prostitution by Cathy Tyson's titular fallen angel.The film opens with the sound of Nat King Cole singing the film's signature tune, as George, lost and dishevelled, in a suit ten years out of date, saunters across Tower Bridge with a parcel under his arm. All we know about George is presented by this opening montage; giving us a confused and dishevelled character, clearly out of prison and now back in a world he doesn't understand. Added to this, his wife has left him, he's forbidden from speaking to his now teenage daughter, the criminal world has moved on to bigger things - drugs, nightclubs, pornography - and the only two people he can count on are Thomas, a poetic Scotsman who lives in a caravan inside a dockland garage, and Mortwell, a local crime king-pin. It is from the latter relationship that George is given a job driving high-class prostitute Simone and it is here, with the exception of a few twists and turns, where the crux of the story is developed.At its core, Mona Lisa is a romance. It speaks of the kind of love depicted in the golden oldies that George listens to whilst waiting for Simone to knock off some Arab diplomat or business executive. He is a character filled with longing. He longs for the England of his youth, an England without immigrants, without prostitution, he longs for his family but most of all, he longs for someone to love. In Simone, he sees the two things he hates most - not only is she a whore, but she's a black whore - yet despite this she represents something more to him, and as the two drift through the streets into the belly of the London underworld, encased in a car that becomes their own metal tomb, she becomes the only beacon of beauty in an frightening and ugly world. Here Jordan is aided by cinematographer Roger Pratt, who turns London's kings cross into an immense labyrinth of lost children and burning rubbish bins, all shot under the kind of silvery night you could only associate with film-noir at its very blackest.Acting is superb throughout. Tyson, in a part similar to the one she would play in Lind La Plant's TV mini-series Band of Gold (1985), manages to essay the role of the femme-fatal to a T. She's always in control of what is going on and more importantly, she's always in control of George. Michael Caine as Mortwell gives a performance the likes of which he hadn't delivered since Get Carter over a decade before. He simply oozes contempt, whether he's cracking jokes with businessmen in a Turkish bathhouse, or berating George for failing to come up with the goods, he always comes across as a vicious and believable villain. However the film really belongs to Hoskins, who here creates a subtle, mannered, sometimes funny sometimes-heartbreaking character' the emotional yin to Harold Shand's yang, that volatile gangster from The Long Good Friday (1980). The centrepiece of the film is without a doubt the last twenty minutes, following the couple's relocation to Brighton, wherein they take a walk along a peer. Without warning Harold's emotions spill out in a soul-destroying monologue to the love he holds for Simone that will always remain unrequited. Here Hoskins cements his reputation as Britain's greatest actor, and, as the film moves into the final bloodbath, George finds his redemption in violence. You'd have f*cking done it he screams at Simone as she points the gun at him, tears pouring down her face, before staggering out onto the empty Brighton beach, as lost and alone as he was when we first met him.This is a truly seminal piece of work, and one that goes far beyond the British Taxi Driver tag that some short-sighted critics have labelled it. Neil Jordan is one of Britain's master filmmakers. His script fizzes with character and emotion, his visuals rival those of any celebrated auteur you might care to mention, and here he has the added bonus of working with Caine and Hoskins, two of England's greatest performers. Mona Lisa is quite simply, one of the greatest British films ever made.

It speaks of the kind of love depicted in the golden oldies that George listens to whilst waiting for Simone to knock off some Arab diplomat or business executive. He is a character filled with longing. He longs for the England of his youth, an England without immigrants, without prostitution, he longs for his family but most of all, he longs for someone to love. In Simone, he sees the two things he hates most - not only is she a whore, but she's a black whore - yet despite this she represents something more to him, and as the two drift through the streets into the belly of the London underworld, encased in a car that becomes their own metal tomb, she becomes the only beacon of beauty in an frightening and ugly world. Here Jordan is aided by cinematographer Roger Pratt, who turns London's kings cross into an immense labyrinth of lost children and burning rubbish bins, all shot under the kind of silvery night you could only associate with film-noir at its very blackest.Acting is superb throughout. Tyson, in a part similar to the one she would play in Lind La Plant's TV mini-series Band of Gold (1985), manages to essay the role of the femme-fatal to a T. She's always in control of what is going on and more importantly, she's always in control of George. Michael Caine as Mortwell gives a performance the likes of which he hadn't delivered since Get Carter over a decade before. He simply oozes contempt, whether he's cracking jokes with businessmen in a Turkish bathhouse, or berating George for failing to come up with the goods, he always comes across as a vicious and believable villain. However the film really belongs to Hoskins, who here creates a subtle, mannered, sometimes funny sometimes-heartbreaking character' the emotional yin to Harold Shand's yang, that volatile gangster from The Long Good Friday (1980). The centrepiece of the film is without a doubt the last twenty minutes, following the couple's relocation to Brighton, wherein they take a walk along a peer. Without warning Harold's emotions spill out in a soul-destroying monologue to the love he holds for Simone that will always remain unrequited. Here Hoskins cements his reputation as Britain's greatest actor, and, as the film moves into the final bloodbath, George finds his redemption in violence. You'd have f*cking done it he screams at Simone as she points the gun at him, tears pouring down her face, before staggering out onto the empty Brighton beach, as lost and alone as he was when we first met him.This is a truly seminal piece of work, and one that goes far beyond the British Taxi Driver tag that some short-sighted critics have labelled it. Neil Jordan is one of Britain's master filmmakers. His script fizzes with character and emotion, his visuals rival those of any celebrated auteur you might care to mention, and here he has the added bonus of working with Caine and Hoskins, two of England's greatest performers. Mona Lisa is quite simply, one of the greatest British films ever made. ","genre":"Crime, Drama, Romance"},{"date":"9 April 2008","score":"","review":" Mona Lisa (1986) is both romantic and repugnant; a classically structured thriller that soars to Michael Kamen's minimalist score, whilst simultaneously burning with issues of loss and self-catharsis. Here, director Neil Jordan skilfully manages to structure his film around a series of intricate character studies, metaphorical iconography and a plot that is never less than enthralling. Jordan, whose previous film was The Company of Wolves (1984), an adaptation of Angela Carter's meta-textual cross-reference of Little Red Riding Hood and the sexual awakening of a young woman, seems obsessed with the codes and conventions of fairy tales. Here, perverted and moved to a modern day setting, Bob Hoskins plays George, a little red riding hood-type figure, lured into a labyrinth of illicit sex and prostitution by Cathy Tyson's titular fallen angel.The film opens with the sound of Nat King Cole singing the film's signature tune, as George, lost and dishevelled, in a suit ten years out of date, saunters across Tower Bridge with a parcel under his arm. All we know about George is presented by this opening montage; giving us a confused and dishevelled character, clearly out of prison and now back in a world he doesn't understand. Added to this, his wife has left him, he's forbidden from speaking to his now teenage daughter, the criminal world has moved on to bigger things - drugs, nightclubs, pornography - and the only two people he can count on are Thomas, a poetic Scotsman who lives in a caravan inside a dockland garage, and Mortwell, a local crime king-pin.
