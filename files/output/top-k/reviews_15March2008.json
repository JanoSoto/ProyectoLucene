I sometimes rail against the tendency of some movies to overdo character development at the expense of story, but here one of the things that put me off from the beginning was the rather sudden move right into the story. With no introduction to the characters - we don't even know the name of the main character - we're thrown right into the story, as a car driven by three girls goes off a bridge and into the river. Once she emerges from the water - to the surprise of everyone - we discover that the main character's name is Mary Henry, and it's her that we follow, although we never really learn much about her except that she's an accomplished organist. Mary was played by an actress named Candace Hilligoss in what I thought was a forgettable performance. I never got much sense of emotion from her, and the emotion the movie did try to portray seemed to me to be forced. In a movie that featured mostly underwhelming and forgettable performances, the best was probably from Sidney Berger as Mary's somewhat lecherous neighbour John Linden, and - because I thought his performance was passable, it's not surprising to me that I found Hilligoss's best scenes were probably those she shot with him.In addition to poor performances, there were a couple of points I thought were just poorly done. One is a technical point as Mary plays the organ, the problem is that the music being played doesn't at all match what she's playing if you watch her hands on the keyboard. In fact, it isn't even close. And I thought it rather strange that Dr. Samuels (Stan Levitt) would take Mary back to his office and spend an hour - according to her - in what seemed to be some sort of psycho-therapy, only to then say to her well, I'm no psychiatrist. As I said, the story is not bad. I had kind of figured out what was happening early on, but there was a fair enough feeling of creepiness that's important for this kind of movie. I would have appreciated knowing why the carnival was so important that Mary feels drawn to it long before she arrives in Utah from wherever she started out (I don't remember her starting point being identified.) That was a significant weakness to me. The plot (of a soul caught somewhere between life and death) was OK, but the mystery of the carnival's attraction was never resolved.The weak acting put me off this one, I have to admit.

I'm not quite sure what this movie was trying to say about Morrison and the band. If it was saying that Jim was anything but a crazy drug addict, then it failed, because that's the only side we see of him here. Occasionally, Stone lets us see his poetic side, but very rarely, and when it does show it's because he's tripping on acid. There's no emotional connections to any character, except maybe Morrison's girlfriend Pamela Courson, but not much for her either. So, with no emotion and no character development, what we have is the outline of what happened with The Doors, and a lot of Val Kilmer imitating Jim Morrison's singing.Everything about this was not all bad. The acting is quite good. Val Kilmer was very believable playing the hard rocker who didn't care for anyone else's opinions. Meg Ryan was good as his struggling girlfriend. Kathleen Quinlin is very good as his critic sex mate. Even Kyle McLaughlan was good as the keyboard player Ray Manzerack. Along with being a good actor, McLaughlan also had the best character, an advocate of Morrison's work, but also a sense of reason that was never listened to. Frank Whaley and Kevin Dillon play the other two band members in small thankless roles.The direction starts off pretty cool, but by the end turns into a major headache. Stone constantly uses blue and red lenses on the camera, no matter what the scene, so instead of being used to symbolize sadness, or anger, they're just there to look cool. A lot of odd zoom ins and strange camera angles are used, and again, they start pretty neat, but after you realize Oliver Stone is just throwing them about for no reason, they get tiring.

She lives in a crumbling old mansion with her butler Max (Erich von Stroheim). She refuses to believe that she's no longer remembered and will never make another movie. She gets Gillis to stay with her and rewrite Salome which she thinks will be her comeback. Gillis has no other choice and things slowly get out of hand.A VERY cynical view of Hollywood--especially for 1950. It shows what Hollywood does to people like Norma--it makes them stars, tells them that they're great and dump them coldly when they're no longer needed. It also takes swipes at directors, agents, screenwriters, even entire studios! It has a tight quick script, is appropriately filmed in gloomy black and white and is masterfully directed by Billy Wilder. Everybody thought this was a bad idea when it was being made. It was believed to be too cold and vicious for the public. Also Holden was warned it would ruin his career by playing a younger man kept by an older woman. But it turned out great and is now rightfully considered a classic.The acting is almost all good. I never thought Nancy Olson was that good. Her character is too pure and sweet to be believable. Everybody else is right on target though. Holden is just great in his role. You see the pity, anger and helplessness on his face when he realizes Norma is falling in love with him--and he's trapped. von Stroheim was equally good as Max who encourages Norma's delusions. Swanson however is just magnificent! She has a very showy role and could have overplayed it--but she doesn't. She's mad for sure--but you only see it peeking through every once in a while. When she loses it completely at the end it's frightening. If she had played it like that all through the movie it never would have worked. How she lost the Oscar that year to Judy Holliday for Born Yesterday is beyond me. This is a must see and a true Hollywood classic but VERY cold and cynical.

She lives in a crumbling old mansion with her butler Max (Erich von Stroheim). She refuses to believe that she's no longer remembered and will never make another movie. She gets Gillis to stay with her and rewrite Salome which she thinks will be her comeback. Gillis has no other choice and things slowly get out of hand.A VERY cynical view of Hollywood--especially for 1950. It shows what Hollywood does to people like Norma--it makes them stars, tells them that they're great and dump them coldly when they're no longer needed. It also takes swipes at directors, agents, screenwriters, even entire studios! It has a tight quick script, is appropriately filmed in gloomy black and white and is masterfully directed by Billy Wilder. Everybody thought this was a bad idea when it was being made. It was believed to be too cold and vicious for the public. Also Holden was warned it would ruin his career by playing a younger man kept by an older woman. But it turned out great and is now rightfully considered a classic.The acting is almost all good. I never thought Nancy Olson was that good. Her character is too pure and sweet to be believable. Everybody else is right on target though. Holden is just great in his role. You see the pity, anger and helplessness on his face when he realizes Norma is falling in love with him--and he's trapped. von Stroheim was equally good as Max who encourages Norma's delusions. Swanson however is just magnificent! She has a very showy role and could have overplayed it--but she doesn't. She's mad for sure--but you only see it peeking through every once in a while. When she loses it completely at the end it's frightening. If she had played it like that all through the movie it never would have worked. How she lost the Oscar that year to Judy Holliday for Born Yesterday is beyond me. This is a must see and a true Hollywood classic but VERY cold and cynical.

He could scare you, shock you, surprise you, enthrall you, make you think, make you smile, make you laugh, and all the while making you a part and parcel of the storytelling and action in his film. His goal was always to make the audience a part of the action and take them along for the ride. He may do this to absolute perfection in this film, NORTH BY NORTHWEST, my absolute favorite film of his. It's debatable whether or not this is his greatest film. A lot of so-called film 'critics' will swear by VERTIGO(although I'm not crazy about it), some say PSYCHO, others say NOTORIOUS, some prefer SHADOW OF A DOUBT, others REBECCA. Who knows? I just know that NORTHW BY NORTHWEST, without a doubt, is the most thoroughly enjoyable, fun, fascinating, entertaining, and eye-popping film that Hitchcock ever did. I love every frame of it. The first 30 minutes alone is more captivating, exciting and entertaining than 99.9% of the crap they throw at us nowadays in the movies.Cary Grant is Roger Thornhill, a normal, run-of-the-mill advertising agency executive. Grant deserves all praise of being the legend that he truly was for what he does in this film. Grant's Roger Thornhill is one of 'us', a fairly regular everyday Joe who gets thrust in the most convoluted of situations mistaken for a government agent named 'Kaplan' by treacherous U.S. enemies (led by the classy James Mason), Thornhill is whisked off captive one evening and his life is threatened and he is almost killed, but he thankfully escapes his captors and so the fun begins in finding out who these bad guys are and why they think he is Kaplan.The film has a kind of snowball effect. Each situation that Thornhill is thrown into or gets himself into is more dangerous than the previous one and he has to find some way to get himself out of it. Hitchcock almost seems to relish scaring the Bejesus out of this guy just to see how he will slick or cajole his way out of it. Thornhill is really an unwitting and unexpected pawn in the battle between U.S. agents and the enemy traitors. All the qualities that made Cary Grant a star shine through in this film he is handsome, classy, witty, funny, sarcastic, and surprisingly agile. Whoever thought he could pull off being an action hero after all those years of playing primarily romantic comedies? But he totally gives a convincing performance in this film.Of course at some point we are introduced to the femme fatale, in this case Eva Marie Saint, who is super-sexy and mysterious in this role. Saint's character makes you realize why so many women found Cary Grant so charming and irresistible.The film has some of the most memorable sequences and set pieces ever in history the United Nations murder, the Mount Rushmore finale, and most of all, that magnificent crop-dusting sequence smack dab in the middle of the film that forever captured the hearts, minds, and imaginations of moviegoers everywhere. The scene is all at once action-packed, scary, dangerous, exciting, and funny.For me, this Hitchcock film (first shown in 1959) can be seen as a very early example of a blockbuster summer action movie. It has all the elements a colorful look and feel, lots of outdoor scenery, nonstop action, a breathtaking pace, and a central character through which the story is told and that we could all identify with and root for.Truly a great achievement by both Alfred Hitchcock and Cary Grant, with big-time assists from a great cast of supporting actors and actresses, a witty script, and the beautiful scenery of various U.S. locations.

The rest is about as real as a film can get while still being interesting. To be two hours about a young man and his issues and to be so good says a lot about the acting and the writing of this film that it's very, very good.Hunting stars Matt Damon as the title role, the enigma that is Will Hunting. Damon is so good at capturing the broad spectrum of his character's emotions. Hunting is written to be a psychological head case who thinks he's figured out what life's about and what people are about and Damon really shows you that. It's a role that would seemingly be played by Leonardo Di Caprio, but we all know what he was busy doing in 1997.Hunting is a janitor at MIT and when he starts solving some of the most difficult of math equations, he gets discovered by Professor Gerald Lambeau (Stellan Skarsgard). Because Hunting is an orphan and spends most of his time around South Boston getting into trouble with his friends, the plot gets moving when the professor agrees to get Hunting out of jail time with the exceptions that he spend time on math with him and that he go to therapy. After therapy with several top shrinks fails, Hunting is taken to Sean Maguire (Robin Williams) and the two form a unique relationship. The film is in general about the psychological and social journey of Hunting as he begins to understand what life's really all about.Just as good as Damon though are Skarsgard and of course Robin Williams, who is in a role that seems perfect for him, or at least he makes it his own very much so in this film. His character is so honest, but also very poignant and funny.It's a simple concept really. You tell the story of a genius who was orphaned and abused as a child and you have a story of untapped potential and of letting go of the past to embrace the future. Damon and Affleck, who are responsible for the film's intelligent screenplay simply tell this in a really complex way, showing it through the relationship between Will and Sean, Sean and Professor Lambeau, and even Will and his best friend Chuckie (Ben Affleck). There's a very wide spectrum and experience there. Sometimes the dialogue does seem a bit too elitist and literary, but most of the time it's natural and just meaningful. Gus Van Sant adds some touches of his own, but this is mostly about the story and the characters, so he succeeds at his job of letting it be about them.Good Will Hunting might now blow you out of the water, but it's touching because it's so human and because the characters could be any of us.

The scene was so poignant because most daughters could clearly picture herself in Anna, the daughter's shoes, or even the mother's.All in all, this is a great movie which deals with two major issues. Even the film is from 1998, it's still just as prevalent ten years later.

It features a wide variety of a bunch of odd characters and a main story situated around a dog-show.Well, to be honest, there isn't really much story in this movie actually. It's a fake documentary, or mockumentary, focusing on the world of dog-shows and their owners. The first halve of the movie mostly consists out of fake interviews with the characters about them and their dogs, while the second halve concentrates more on the travel to- and the actual dog-show. The movie is not always made credible as a fake documentary because of its way of filming, editing and overall story-telling, so the movie is more stuck somewhere between a mockumentary and just a subtle comedy. Not that this makes the movie any less fun to watch though. It's obvious director Christopher Guest tried to make his own This Is Spinal Tap, a movie and early fake documentary he was involved with previously as an actor, song writer, composer and writer. He also does all of those things in this movie by the way and then some more as well.It's obvious director and writer Christopher Guest let his actors do a whole lot of improvisation and gave them lots of room to play. At times he just lets the camera role and let the actors do their thing. They come up with with things at times as they just go along. Some of the actors handle this better than the others. I think this is because every actor is itself is very individualistic and want to do things their way, which is not always possible when the actors opposite you is having a monologue concerning the other actor opposite and all you can do is respond to it and just go along with the other actor. Some actors on the other do know how to handle this and go along perfectly with it, such as for instance Eugene Levy.

Though Airplane is a parody of disaster films, like the Airport movies, it never actually spoofs a scene from the film. It's more like a typical disaster film.

There's no stupid voices and dumb readings, and that's one major thing that makes this a great parody film.Airplane starts off much jokier than it becomes. Once everyone is aboard the plane, all the characters are introduced through a joke scene. For example, the little boy gives this girl he likes coffee, and she says, I like men like I like my coffee...black. That is an old joke, but in context it's very funny. Any repetition in the jokes is admitted. Every time someone misunderstands what someone else has said, the actors end their sentence with, ...but that's not important right now. It's purposeful repetition that gets funnier as it goes along.Now, onto the actors. They were all phenomenal. Aside from the two main characters, who were fairly new to acting (This was Julie Haggerty's first film), everyone else was a long time serious actor. Leslie Nielson plays Rumack, a doctor who happens to be on the plane. Leslie Nielson takes the role completely seriously, never once cracking a smile to his ridiculous character.

That's because he always tried to contour the adversities, even if, in the end, that shows shaped with irony and criticism to his patrons, using the possibilities they give. That's what he does here. The results aren't so much impressive, maybe because he mixes different worlds. He basically has a romance to tell, that's why he was hired, in order to produce the romantic comedy the way he was expected, beginning of the 60' but done in the 50's fashion. But in fact, he is anguished because he feels attached and dependent of a system of film production that doesn't allow him to express freely his concerns, his themes, his own ways. He would have the last refusal late in his life, when Spielberg wouldn't let him direct Schindler's list. That's why i feel his Stalag 17 must probably be a quite personal project for Wilder, one i'll look forward to see, soon. In this process of fighting for his own expression, he created a masterpiece, Sunset Boulevard, and the less interesting Ace in the Hole. The noir served perfectly his intentions to fold his inner feelings without shouting them, and still allowing him to make the film he'd been asked to do.Here, this didn't work that much. Since he was working with the romance, he replaced the noir environment for sex. So we have a character immersed in a modern world of exploitation, where he is told what to do, has his life sabotaged by the interests of (many) superiors. This is a world Chaplin had created in Modern Times, but here he replaces the fantastically choreographed machinery of the factory for sex. The apartment is a meeting point, sex drives what happens here, all of it. So, a man caught up by a system who has to work his ways to gain his freedom of decision. Get it?Jack Lemmon is a bliss, i really enjoy his non explosive, yet intense, comedy style. He has a way to move, to walk, that strenghtens his character, and in this particular case, makes him likable and easy to believe to be a pawn in the oppressive corrupt world. He's something of a tramp here. This is not innocent. The tramp may be one the more metaphorical characters in cinema, and he always portrays things we don't get on screen. Shirley MacLaine fits well, her face isn't as enigmatic and intense as that of the Hepburns, but she moves more enthusiastically.After so many years, i think what holds this film watchable are the performances. By now i don't have Wilder's context, and i'm way too far from the audiences who praised this in its time. And the whole machinery of sex seems like a line totally apart from the romance we get to follow, it's not merged properly, i think. Nevertheless there is a tenderness in the interpretations, and a nostalgia i take to the film as i start to watch it, not because i lived those days, but because i got to see what was made of these performers, Lemmon and MacLaine.

Shirley MacLaine fits well, her face isn't as enigmatic and intense as that of the Hepburns, but she moves more enthusiastically.After so many years, i think what holds this film watchable are the performances. By now i don't have Wilder's context, and i'm way too far from the audiences who praised this in its time. And the whole machinery of sex seems like a line totally apart from the romance we get to follow, it's not merged properly, i think. Nevertheless there is a tenderness in the interpretations, and a nostalgia i take to the film as i start to watch it, not because i lived those days, but because i got to see what was made of these performers, Lemmon and MacLaine. Nostalgia is a powerful ingredient.My opinion 3\/5 http\/\/www.7eyes.wordpress.com ","genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance"},{"date":"15 March 2008","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" How likely is a whimsical romance between a classic, delusional paranoid and his doctor? Perhaps not likely, unless the paranoid is Justin Playfair, who since his wife died two years previously believes he is Sherlock Holmes (George C. Scott), and the psychiatrist hired to commit him for life to an insane asylum, who is named Dr. Mildred Watson (Joanne Woodward). The movie sounds too cute for words, but is in fact a witty, clever look at how solitary people can find all kinds of strength and affection when they come together. Well, that's true for most of the movie. There are two weaknesses, one minor and one major, to deal with before Holmes and Dr. Watson prepare themselves for their meeting with Moriarty. Playfair was an astute and wealthy New York judge, noted for his analytical mind and dedication to justice. When his wife died he descended into paranoia. Now he is Sherlock Holmes, obsessed with finding the evil genius Moriarty. He dresses like Holmes, sounds faintly British and possesses an acute eye for analysis. Half the trick in finding clues is knowing that they're there, he says. He is superb at finding clues everyone else misses. His younger brother, Blevins Playfair, is determined to have him committed to an insane asylum. Not because Holmes is a danger to anyone, but because Blevins is in debt to criminals. With Holmes institutionalized, Blevins will control the family fortune. The criminals believe that simply shooting Holmes would be a far quicker way to insure that Blevins gets the money to pay them back. Dr. Watson is the one person who must sign the documents to put Holmes away. She's not going to do this until she can examine him. The last thing Blevins wants is for Watson to think Holmes can be cured. You don't think he can be, do you? Blevins asks Watson. Cure a classic? Once in a generation. It's a marvelous disease, you know. The victim's faculties grow keener and ultra-sensitive...and he's capable of things that seem like genius. Before long, however, Holmes is on the trail of Moriarty and Watson must follow along if she's going to fully diagnosis her patient. In the process, Holmes finds a grudging respect for Watson. He's been waiting for his Watson for a long time and is prepared to accept the fact that this Dr. Watson is a woman. If I'm such a liability, she tells him with acerbity, what do you want me for? Holmes looks at her in a mildly friendly way. Oh, you mustn't feel inferior. Try saying to yourself, 'I'm adequate.' Mildred Watson, a slightly dowdy woman with a messy apartment who can't cook, is finally drawn to Holmes' integrity and passion. Will this be love? In an odd sort of way, yes, it will be. As Holmes pursues Moriarty's clues throughout New York City, he and Watson encounter a number of engaging misfits, lonely people and eccentrics. It all works until we get to the first bump in the road...that minor weakness. Taken one at a time, the eccentrics make for engaging and touching vignettes. Put all the eccentrics together, marching purposefully behind Watson and Holmes down a dark street and then rescuing the two from the police in a huge, empty supermarket, and we come dangerously close to the whimsical cutes. Then we must deal with a major question, and we encounter the major weakness. How will the movie end? Each one who sees the movie will most likely find their own answer. Perhaps that was the author's and director's intention. For me, I can't help but think that they simply couldn't come up with an effective conclusion based on the plot they had developed. Since I had come to like Holmes and Watson so much, I was left with wanting a conclusion I could smile at. What I was left with was a head scratch. Scott and Woodward do marvelous jobs in creating two lonely characters we begin to root for. As actors, they were worth every penny they were paid. For lessons in star quality and acting skill, pay close attention to Scott as he teases out of a mute patient why the man doesn't speak, and later to Woodward as she prepares a dinner for Holmes in her apartment. For a lesson in team acting by two equally matched pros, watch Holmes and Watson realize how they feel about each other at Watson's apartment. Scattered throughout the movie are some fine actors playing the eccentrics and assorted other characters, a few so quickly seen they're easily lost. Some to look for include Jack Gilford, Eugene Roche, Al Lewis, James Tolkan, F. Murray Abraham, M. Emmet Walsh, Rue McLanahan, Staats Cotsworth (of Casey, Crime Photographer fame on radio), Kitty Winn and Worthington Minor. He was the producer a long time ago behind Studio One when television every week presented live drama. They Might Be Giants is a fine movie. It's well worth watching for the skilled characterizations by two star actors and for an excellent script. While I might find the last ten minutes a bit unsatisfying, Sherlock Holmes and Mildred Watson are still worth believing in. As Holmes says as he and Watson stand together looking into the dark, We're coming for you, Moriarty. We may not look like much. We may not have your weapons. We may lack your dark allies. Why, we may even lose...I'm not invincible. But together, sir, we may surprise you!

This movie does not at all strike me as a movie that could be enjoyed by people of all ages, mostly because of that picture on the movie box. Ever since King Kong Lives I have developed an almost frightening aversion to any movie that features grinning gorillas. Nevertheless I gave this one a chance and I'm glad I did.Amazingly enough, almost immediately I discovered that this movie is funnier than most adult comedies that I've seen lately, even the good ones. There are so many laugh-out- loud moments just in the first 30 minutes that I didn't know how they could keep that up. Sadly, they don't, but even the less impressive second half is a fun romp through the city at the expense of some witless crooks. The kids are gonna love this. The similarities to Home Alone are obvious and expected, being written by John Hughes, who has an astonishing list of writing, producing and directing credits stretching over the last 35 years, including genuine classics like Ferris Bueller's Day Off, The Breakfast Club, The Great Outdoors and Home Alone. And yes, Home Alone is a classic, I don't care what anyone says!There is one scene of ridiculous bad taste, when Eddie (Joe Mantegna) is hiding the baby under his coat so the police don't find it, only to suddenly discover that he has to maintain his cool before the men in blue as the baby lights a Zippo lighter and lights his crotch on fire. For a movie that is so obviously meant for a very young audience, this one has a surprising amount of sex jokes. That is, however, the only major problem with the movie (except at the end when they discover that Baby is only acting out his favorite storybook. RIGHT).

Sure the concept of these people living on the ocean is sort of strange but it is a fantasy action movie. I think this movie got the critics wrath because of the time and money that went into making it. As I recall back in 1995\/1996, reports about this film was it was taking forever to film, was way over budget AND the Costner was coming off a big hit with Dances with Wolves. I do find the typical liberal political overtones a but tiring (references to the Enola Gay (first plane to drop the A-Bomb) and the Exxon Valdez - but what do you expect - it's Hollywierd.So if you find yourself home channel surfing and you see Waterworld on and you've never seen it. Take the leap, I bet you will surprised. ","genre":"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"15 March 2008","score":"11 out of 21 people found the following review useful","review":" What to say! I kept hearing about this film during my first few years at secondary school, as Scary Movie 3 had just come out. So I decided to watch it and I'm glad I did!

Anna Faris will most likely have a great movie career, the Wayans brothers were a nice touch, as was Shannon Elizabeth, Lochlyn Munro and another intriguing character, Regina Hall. All I can say is see this film, have some laughs and buy the sequels as soon as possible, as they are equally fantastic in all aspects of comedy and quite possibly, horror!
