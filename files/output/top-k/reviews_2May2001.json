With more production problems than my neighbor's dog has flees, I was not expecting the film to be of any extraordinary quality. It isn't. I did, considering the respectable cast and crew, expect to laugh. I did, but not enough. This is the kind of comedy where we laugh when the jokes are presented, but there are not enough of them. Therefore, we want more, but the movie never delivers-leaving us with a feeling of disappointment. With a budget of over 90 million and shooting dates that range over three years, this film should have been the pearl of the ocean. Although Town & Country has its moments of hilarity, insight, and interest, the film as a whole does not quite work.\tTown & Country stars Warren Beatty, whose previous satire Bulworth offered more biting comedy than this film multiplied by three. He plays Porter Stoddard, an acclaimed New York architect, who is having an affair with a beautiful, married musician (Nastassja Kinski). Porter has a wealthy lifestyle and a loving wife, Ellie (Diane Keaton), who suspects nothing from her husband for 25 years. The Stoddard's have a close-nit friendship with another couple, Mona (Goldie Hawn), and Griffin (Garry Shandling from What Planet Are You From?). Griffin is also committing adultery, but his wife discovers his betrayal and immediately dumps him-even though she is not exactly faithful herself. \tThe setup is basically just a clothesline from which other related situations evolve. Although often interesting, adultery isn't enough to develop a story over 100 minutes in length. The movie begins well (after some painful music during the opening credits) but stumbles very early, with its characters wandering from scene to scene with nothing much to do or say.  Then the story becomes redundant, with Porter making the same mistakes repeatedly. But surprisingly, there is very little tension involved with the plot, simply because we do not care about the characters. There is just not enough at stake here. There are a few hilarious scenes that transpire when the characters attempt to cover up their deceitful decisions, and the actors are consistently fun to watch, with likable chemistry and energy. The cast does a great job with their charismatic and entertaining performances, making this movie relatively easy to watch. But even they can't bring enough life into this otherwise desperate, deprived material.\tTown & Country is clearly trying to say that people can engage in adultery without much effort or thought, but it is not fulfilling or constructive. During the film's closing minutes, Porter explains, in a scene much too obvious for its own good, that sex has not filled the emptiness inside him. We never believe that Porter felt such loneliness, however, for several reasons1)  Warren Beatty does not do a convincing job at executing his character's emotions. All of the characters feel very external. We seldom feel anything for any of them.2)  The story runs into a particularly noticeable series of problems during its last third. When it should be calming down, focusing in on the character's emotional areas, it does exactly the opposite introduces new events completely unrelated to the material before. We also meet numerous characters that only distract us from the movie's theme. There is some funny material within these segments of the movie, but for the most part, these sequences really detour the plot.Town & Country isn't as bad as many people are saying. It is just a disappointment considering the ample potential. With 90 million dollars, over three years, and names like Warren Beatty, Diane Keaton, Goldie Hawn, Garry Shandling, Andie MacDowell, and Charlton Heston, we come to expect a whole lot more. I have seen special effects laden action thrillers made for half the cost of Town & Country and much less talent, but so much more was projected on the screen. The only thing this production does with its talent and money is prove that raunchy sex comedies can be made with older generations too.

The film was released a good five months before Tom Cruise became the next box-office draw in Top Gun.  Cruise plays the instinctive and nature born Jack, the forestboy who is in love with the lovely princess Lilly (the lovely Mia Sara).  In their perfect and innocent world lives another realm ,that is the ultimate antonym of things, the land of darkness ,black magic ,human torture and down-right evil.  Things are so black there that even the lord of this realm goes by the name Darkness.  There is a constant struggle between which realm must outlive the other , even though it is stated that neither one can exsist without the other. The fate of the realm of good and the realm of evil is in the hands (or hooves) of two magical unicorns that Jack must protect.  Now that that is out of the way, let's get to the review.  This film was the collabarative work of the some unique and gifted artists.  Tom Cruise and Mia Sara more one of the most sweetest Hollywood pairings on the screen.  The Demonic Darkness ,played by the versital and heavily under-rated Tim Curry, is not only chilling and intimidating but also romantic in his own evil way.  Curry is so convincing in this role, you'ed swear that Darkness is being played by someone else.  The storyline is your basic Good vs Evil ,but with a twist.  Instead of the an old testament style story that represents Good with attractive characters and Evil with unattractive characters, it digs a little deeper with the concept of what is good and what is evil.  Jack, Lilly, Darkness and lovestruck fairy Oona all go through their own inner struggle between good and evil.  One character ,in particular, Blunder make the effort to mend his ways to join the good fight. Speaking of fairies, this film is chock full of things that are found in a good fairy tale.  Everything from fairies to goblins, elves to monsters, unicorns to the undead zombies, heroes and villains, a beautiful princess and a foul witch. The film was not short on comic-relif.  These duties were handled well by the characters Brown Tom and Screwball (played by the late great Billy Barty).  The Irish elf Brown Tom had the most memerable lines like She was alive still when they killed me and I'm not as old as I used to be!  He even did his best Mark McGuire impression in one scene.  All of these elements are seriously underplayed by the masterful direction of Ridley Scott.  If there is one director who knows how to compose an elaborate and captivating backdrop for a film, then it is Ridley Scott and this film is no exception.  Everything element of his backdrop is so pleasing to the eye that is borders on intoxicating.  From the wilderness mountain cliff, to the black gown dance invites the audience to get a little lost in these visions.  even the oscar nomminated make-up effects boggled the mind on how genuine and surreal they looked.  You'll start clapping your hands was soon as Oona makes her entrance, to make you believe in fairies.  All of this in wrapped up in the stirring score ,done by the rock group Tangerine Dream.  Unfortunately ,no film is as perfect as the land that Jack and Lilly live in.  The film did suffer in a few areas.  The climactic sword duel between Jack and Darkness was something to be desired of a Phantom Menace or a Princess Bride.  Cruise seemed as if he merely did piroets with a sword.  Much of the fight scenes were too criptic and dark-lit.  The same goes for Jacks' confrontation with the goblin Meg.  The directors-cut shows a more complete version of that sequence.  (Yes, Cruise did all his own stunts) Honey-Thore Gump is just a little to annoying and self-ritchous to appreciate and his voice sounds a little too similar to the witch Blix.  The ending is a little confusing.  We are not to know why Jack and Lilly had to leave their community of forest dwellers or wheather the last vision of Darkness was another demon of Darkness himself sporting different color eyes.  I personally like to think that this was just a reminder of the recurring theme that there can be no good without evil ,instead of a plug to leave the door open for a sequel, because the film does fine without any kind of follow-up.  To sum up, this film is one of the more underappreciated gems that was made back in the decade of decadence (the 80's).  Knowing that a film like this was made before the digital age is a big plus.  Secondly this film is ,as said before, the last time a film like this will ever be done.  An elaboratly made fantasy film ,starring one of the biggest actors in his prime, by one of the best directors of our time ,without the use of digital technology.  True one can be optimistic about the upcoming Lord of the Rings trilogy, but for now, well can only harp about poorly done films with inept WB-type actors , all digital sets and effects ,for a less then popular film genre, with stories that have no heart and no direction , like the recent Dungeons and Dragons     For the time, one can be glad that the film in on DVD was just enjoy this masterpiece, or complain that it's just more fairy glamour.

","genre":"Adventure, Fantasy, Romance"},{"date":"2 May 2001","score":"","review":"  Ledgend is probably the last time movie fans will get this kind of combination of artists in this manner.  The film was released a good five months before Tom Cruise became the next box-office draw in Top Gun.  Cruise plays the instinctive and nature born Jack, the forestboy who is in love with the lovely princess Lilly (the lovely Mia Sara).  In their perfect and innocent world lives another realm ,that is the ultimate antonym of things, the land of darkness ,black magic ,human torture and down-right evil.  Things are so black there that even the lord of this realm goes by the name Darkness.  There is a constant struggle between which realm must outlive the other , even though it is stated that neither one can exsist without the other. The fate of the realm of good and the realm of evil is in the hands (or hooves) of two magical unicorns that Jack must protect.  Now that that is out of the way, let's get to the review.  This film was the collabarative work of the some unique and gifted artists.  Tom Cruise and Mia Sara more one of the most sweetest Hollywood pairings on the screen.  The Demonic Darkness ,played by the versital and heavily under-rated Tim Curry, is not only chilling and intimidating but also romantic in his own evil way.  Curry is so convincing in this role, you'ed swear that Darkness is being played by someone else.  The storyline is your basic Good vs Evil ,but with a twist.  Instead of the an old testament style story that represents Good with attractive characters and Evil with unattractive characters, it digs a little deeper with the concept of what is good and what is evil.  Jack, Lilly, Darkness and lovestruck fairy Oona all go through their own inner struggle between good and evil.  One character ,in particular, Blunder make the effort to mend his ways to join the good fight. Speaking of fairies, this film is chock full of things that are found in a good fairy tale.  Everything from fairies to goblins, elves to monsters, unicorns to the undead zombies, heroes and villains, a beautiful princess and a foul witch. The film was not short on comic-relif.  These duties were handled well by the characters Brown Tom and Screwball (played by the late great Billy Barty).  The Irish elf Brown Tom had the most memerable lines like She was alive still when they killed me and I'm not as old as I used to be!  He even did his best Mark McGuire impression in one scene.  All of these elements are seriously underplayed by the masterful direction of Ridley Scott.  If there is one director who knows how to compose an elaborate and captivating backdrop for a film, then it is Ridley Scott and this film is no exception.  Everything element of his backdrop is so pleasing to the eye that is borders on intoxicating.  From the wilderness mountain cliff, to the black gown dance invites the audience to get a little lost in these visions.  even the oscar nomminated make-up effects boggled the mind on how genuine and surreal they looked.  You'll start clapping your hands was soon as Oona makes her entrance, to make you believe in fairies.  All of this in wrapped up in the stirring score ,done by the rock group Tangerine Dream.  Unfortunately ,no film is as perfect as the land that Jack and Lilly live in.  The film did suffer in a few areas.  The climactic sword duel between Jack and Darkness was something to be desired of a Phantom Menace or a Princess Bride.  Cruise seemed as if he merely did piroets with a sword.  Much of the fight scenes were too criptic and dark-lit.  The same goes for Jacks' confrontation with the goblin Meg.  The directors-cut shows a more complete version of that sequence.  (Yes, Cruise did all his own stunts) Honey-Thore Gump is just a little to annoying and self-ritchous to appreciate and his voice sounds a little too similar to the witch Blix.  The ending is a little confusing.  We are not to know why Jack and Lilly had to leave their community of forest dwellers or wheather the last vision of Darkness was another demon of Darkness himself sporting different color eyes.  I personally like to think that this was just a reminder of the recurring theme that there can be no good without evil ,instead of a plug to leave the door open for a sequel, because the film does fine without any kind of follow-up.  To sum up, this film is one of the more underappreciated gems that was made back in the decade of decadence (the 80's).  Knowing that a film like this was made before the digital age is a big plus.  Secondly this film is ,as said before, the last time a film like this will ever be done.

And I thought the AFI's list was crap.  Maybe it's just me, but I don't visualize this movie beside Casablanca and Gone with the Wind in movie history.Just like El Mariachi this is another import\/experimental action flick in which style (massively) outweighs substance.  This is one of those movies I would've been impressed with if it were entered as a student film.  Its visual style is the kind you would spot in a student film, and I would give it top honors if it were submitted as a project of an amateur filmmaker. But when you view it as part of mainstream cinema...it's far from impressive.The lightning-fast pacing and sequence of events is reminiscent of Doug Liman's Go, but that film--though a bit cheesy--enabled us to get to know the characters.  In Run Lola Run the characters are no more than players in a video game.  The film's use of split screens and other techniques is fun at first, but just like the original Thomas Crown Affair it causes it to wear out its welcome.  The makers of this film were just trying too damn hard!
