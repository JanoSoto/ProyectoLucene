A detective(Willem Dafoe) is in pursuit of these two killers who have become media sensations. This film is fascinating in it's way of glamorizing these killings that these two men go on. However, instead of it being entertaining, it has strange details littered throughout that push the film into a strange field. Sure, people could try to justify the actions of the main characters, but people could also try to justify the rampage that the teenage gang went on in Stanley Kubrick's A CLOCKWORK ORANGE by pointing out how gross and nasty the attitudes are of all the victims, or the torturing and starving of the young woman in Johnathan Demme's SILENCE OF THE LAMBS judging by her careless stupidity, her over use of bad language, and selfish nature toward the climax of the film. All the people who get killed in THE BOONDOCK SAINTS are shown to be sleazy, corrupt, and mean. However, they could all have loving families who still love them. What about those people? Do they deserve to have members of their families murdered? So can a person really succeed in justify these brothers' murders? These questions and more are things that I thought about as watched this film. This is more than just an action film. In a way, it's about morality and about how hatred and low opinions are damaging factors in many people's downfalls. Sure, two people can go on a murder spree and kill bad people, but is it really okay for them to do this, even if they claim to be doing it for God?

On Danish television 15-16 years ago they would show old American classics among which The Magnificent Seven was one. It aired quite a few times after wards and my Dad and I would watch it on Saturday afternoon with our legs up on either couch...well I would watch it, my Dad would usually nod off after twenty minutes. That's why this movie, to me, is epitome of nostalgia. It is in my humble opinion that this is about as good a western as they come. I haven't seen the original movie Seven Samurai and I don't think it really matters.This is just a magnificent movie in it is own right. The all-star cast and the FANTASITIC score by Elmer Berstein lifts this movie up and beyond any other western ever made. I have never been a fan of the butch-chauvinistic-patriotic westerns starring John Wayne, as they are too much caricatures where the characters in this one come of as REAL people.The great, although sparse, dialog between the gunslingers set up the feel of the characters and their background. The whole conversation during dinner where the six experienced fighters try to tell the newbie that their lives really suck and that they NEVER can win, is just pure brilliance and completely unheard of until then.I can only regret that this classic movie was turned into a franchise with very poor sequels, and I can only wonder why Brynner agreed to do no 2, and George Kennedy as Chris in the following two is just not believable. Brynner, McQuen and Bronson in the original are really the driving forces of the group and Bronson's talent for under-acting is bone chillingly great.

I've read her autobio. She had privilege, beauty and wealth. And her feet were firmly planted for most of her life. She was ambasadoress to Italy.In my critique of The Women, it's important to separate today's greater sophistication from 1937 or '38's simpler times. (The Women also had a successful Broadway run.) However, I'm not going to bother following that rule, because it's too restrictive.Brilliant dialogue, dramas and books long preceded The Women. Writers didn't have to make their points with one-dimensional characters, or near-slapstick hysteria. So why did she write a drama with such shallow, cliché characters? I have no quarrel with the storyline; it's linear in its simplicity husband strays, wife sues for divorce, goes to Reno to establish residency, meets a gaggle of near-idiot friends, relatives and strangers; returns home to NYC, realizes that her husband is unhappy with the floozie that he married, and fights to gain him back. Roz Russell should have been locked up, she maintained such a borderline frenzied attitude; the Countess de la Whatever, easily 60 (and looked even older) was straight out of a whorehouse and with the libido of an alley cat; Paulette Goddard (smart enough to have married Charley Chaplin) always passing marital advice on to others, yet has her claws out to cat fight with Roz; Marjorie Maine (astonishingly pretty), housekeeper in Reno who sang at the top of her lungs with a voice like a parrot being strangled. --And, god, who else? Joan Crawford already getting on some - being bitchy and manipulative.I didn't like The Women. It thought itself alarmingly funny, when it was more like the Marx bros. in drag. Anita Loos helped with the dialogue. Ms. Loos and Frances Marion were the kingpins of MGM's writers. Deservedly. But not for this over-baked, over-perfumed, heavy-handed romp.

And honestly, as I watched this, I was far too entertained to care if I could tell how they did this or that. The dialog is well-written, with several clever lines. The designs are rich. The details... wow. There are some grotesque images in this, a little language, moderate and strong, and a suggestive thing or two. The DVD features a theatrical trailer and a music-only track.

The man and woman aforementioned may be a teenage boy and a 79 year old woman, but that is only surface detail that may work to draw one into the deep meaning of the connection between the two. And that connection expunges the surface detail of that long transit of age between them. The sexual revolution not only gave more leeway for the young to experiment sexually. Director Hal Ashby reminds us here that that revolution need not be just for the young, and that there should be a more holistic meaning of freedom. In the context of this movie, a freedom not limited to age. Set during the uncertain latter days of the rights revolutions in the early seventies, Maude is an original player in the social protests from the early 20th century Progressive era. To her, the Sixties hoopla is but old news, or rather universal and transcending ideas, attitudes and feelings that transmorph into new threads from olde wares. She has already participated in her collective revolution, and now she takes care of the personal. Harold is a teenage boy who finds both a dark amusement and psychologically necessary outlet in pretending to kill himself . His morbidity and her lust for life brings them together at a funeral they're both attending just for the hell&#x96;or the life (cycle)&#x96; of it one does it due to a dark obsession with death, and the other to participate in the sacred and infinite life and death cycles of nature. This mutual coming together over death provides the launching pad of their intimate and unusual relationship. The movie's uplifting call for life to be lived instead of to be moped and grieved is expressed genuinely and genuinely felt by the creators and more perceptive viewers respectively. It wins for its celebration of true love and what it really means to truly love. The transcendent qualities of love are of paramount importance here it doesn't bother Harold that the woman he loves is so sundered from him in experience and age, and it doesn't bother Maude that a young man with some serious mental issues, because want keeps them enamoured of each other extinguishes those other distances. Their quirky but perfectly natural bond is stuff that make one breath a little bit easier, with the reassuring idea that there is something someone for everyone no matter how old or weird and alienated one is. I hate describing such a nuanced film with such tired clichés; please don't let those deter you from thinking it's any good. This film is anything but a cliché; if fact, it is one of the most unique love stories before of since. I could go on and write about the subtle and naturalistic acting, like for instance the facial gestures that are crucial but often overlooked by more recent viewers, the speechless moments where communication is expressed flawlessly without speech, but I'll just leave it at that.

Kurosawa made movie to explore his inner artistry, and each movie was a different exploration of his approach to movie making. Shichinin No Samurai was different even for Kurosawa as he explored the limits of realism in movie at the time, and has not been surpassed since then by any Japanese movies. In this movie Kurosawa limited other experimentation to maximize realism, and also didn't include the twist in plot he preferred like in Rashomon or dive too deeply into personal issues like in Norainu. This is probably the reason why movie stands so well after half a century, and have such universal appeal. For instance, Kanbei's character is very believable even today as opposed to character of Chris in the Magnificent Seven which was based on this movie. It was different even for Kurosawa, and maybe the only actor who didn't understand it was Toshiro Mifune who've starred in Kurosawa's movies many times. He acts just as he does in other of Kurosawa's movies which he's played and distracts slightly from the realism. The tone of the movie is very realistic and focus on survival, as opposed to having a real war lord or a samurai. The samurai characters in this movie are actually ronin who are out of jobs and are wandering the landscape to find a lord who would hire them. So there are really no hero character in this movie (something of Kurosawa's preference). The tone is somewhat noir but the difference is, every lines are sharp and beautiful in this movie. Plot shows the agenda of each parties and person, and revolves around that. The focus is on people, and the issues and needs are immediate. There were other Japanese movies of the time where the focus were on people (such as Ozu Jinpachi's Tokyo Monogatari), but none had the immediate need of people in the central focus as in this one.These are the things that separates Shichnin No Samurai from the rest of the pack. The movie was very experimental for its time, and it succeeded. Nobody else was able to follow Kurosawa's craft as history shows, no other samurai movie achieved the kind of realism this movie did. Kurosawa himself went on to explore other areas of his artistry and never returned to this format. Which makes this one of a kind movie and a master piece from one of the great director of 20th century.

Kurosawa made movie to explore his inner artistry, and each movie was a different exploration of his approach to movie making. Shichinin No Samurai was different even for Kurosawa as he explored the limits of realism in movie at the time, and has not been surpassed since then by any Japanese movies. In this movie Kurosawa limited other experimentation to maximize realism, and also didn't include the twist in plot he preferred like in Rashomon or dive too deeply into personal issues like in Norainu. This is probably the reason why movie stands so well after half a century, and have such universal appeal. For instance, Kanbei's character is very believable even today as opposed to character of Chris in the Magnificent Seven which was based on this movie. It was different even for Kurosawa, and maybe the only actor who didn't understand it was Toshiro Mifune who've starred in Kurosawa's movies many times. He acts just as he does in other of Kurosawa's movies which he's played and distracts slightly from the realism. The tone of the movie is very realistic and focus on survival, as opposed to having a real war lord or a samurai. The samurai characters in this movie are actually ronin who are out of jobs and are wandering the landscape to find a lord who would hire them. So there are really no hero character in this movie (something of Kurosawa's preference). The tone is somewhat noir but the difference is, every lines are sharp and beautiful in this movie. Plot shows the agenda of each parties and person, and revolves around that. The focus is on people, and the issues and needs are immediate. There were other Japanese movies of the time where the focus were on people (such as Ozu Jinpachi's Tokyo Monogatari), but none had the immediate need of people in the central focus as in this one.These are the things that separates Shichnin No Samurai from the rest of the pack. The movie was very experimental for its time, and it succeeded. Nobody else was able to follow Kurosawa's craft as history shows, no other samurai movie achieved the kind of realism this movie did. Kurosawa himself went on to explore other areas of his artistry and never returned to this format. Which makes this one of a kind movie and a master piece from one of the great director of 20th century.

Started out relatively strong, but faded in the end when it got a bit to sentimental, which admittedly a lot of comedies tend to do. The story has Murphy as a Prince who is to be married to a woman who has been groomed to be his bride by following his every command. Eddie's character does not want this though, he yearns to find real love so he is off to America a place where not everyone knows who he is to find Mrs. Right as it were. He gets a job as a worker at a McDonald's rip off type joint (which to me is the funniest parts of the movie) and falls for the daughter of the man who runs this establishment all the while keeping his identity as a prince a secret. Arsenio is rather good as his faithful traveling companion as is most of the cast. They are not the problem, the fact this movie tends to lag is. Slow lengths of the film where there is not all that much funny stuff going on, the movie is under two hours, but feels more like a two and a half hour movie. I say I would have liked it more had they trimmed it down ten or so minutes and kept the laughs going throughout the whole movie as they were the first part of it.

I also first saw the film probably as early as 1995, though I'm not sure if I saw the whole thing. My clearest memory of that experience is the scene where Jim Carrey puts the mask on and says, It's party time! I saw it again a few years later, in my early teens (left with a clearer memory of it that time), and have seen it twice within the past couple years. I may not have enjoyed the second viewing of the two QUITE as much as the first, but it at least came close, and was still a lot better than the last Jim Carrey movie I watched, Liar Liar.Stanley Ipkiss is a shy bank clerk who is easily pushed around and can't seem to ever be romantically successful. However, after one unlucky day, he finds a mysterious mask floating in the water near the bridge! He takes it back to his apartment with him, where he tries it on, and it magically turns him into a crazy, powerful, tough, aggressive, green-headed alter ego, The Mask! He doesn't know this at first, but this mask is an ancient one that represents Loki, the Norse night god of mischief! As the Mask, the bank clerk begins to wreak havoc in the corridor, and then outside, where he scares off a bunch of street thugs! He then wakes up the next morning, thinking it was all a dream, but he is wrong! After this, he continues to put the mask on at night, and tends to have better luck than he did before he found it, including his luck with romance, winning the heart of his love interest, Tina Carlyle. However, nobody in the city knows who's behind this mask, and since Stanley tends to cause trouble with it on, the police are after him. Not only that, he also finds the local mob after him! The last time I watched this 1994 blockbuster, a couple nights ago, I certainly didn't find it consistently hilarious, and it took a little while for it to really pick up. The first REALLY funny part I found was when Stanley Ipkiss' borrowed car falls apart just before he finds the mask. After that, there are quite a few very funny, sometimes hilarious moments thanks to Ipkiss' green alter ego, including the part where he pretends he's dying in a mobster's arms. The Mask is a rather silly character, but that doesn't mean not funny. The humour still isn't as consistent as I had hoped, and the scene where Stanley, with his mask on, forcing everyone around to dance may be a bit overlong. However, it's not entirely the humour that's making me give The Mask an 8\/10. It also gets suspenseful at times, especially towards the end. So, I couldn't rate this film any more than a 7 if it relied entirely on humour for its entertainment value, but with the humour AND adrenaline combined, I think an 8 is more like it. Also, something I got out of this film that I obviously wouldn't have back in the mid-nineties is Cameron Diaz, who is so hot here in the role of Tina Carlyle!The Mask is not the greatest comedy ever made, and Jim Carrey's antics are not always funny, but they usually work, unlike in Liar Liar, where his silly voices, sounds, etc. got on my nerves a bit. Here, his character's alter ego is an amusing one, and is a lot like a cartoon character, so it's not much of a surprise that this movie spawned an animated series, which brings back memories, as I saw some episodes of that cartoon during its fairly brief run and enjoyed them. If you can't stand Carrey as a comedian in general, then I'm sure his performance here would be no exception to you in this film. On the other hand, for Jim Carrey fans (or those who SOMETIMES find him funny), who want a comedy, action, and fantasy adventure, this successful blockbuster from fourteen years ago could easily turn out to be an entertaining experience.

If you read the book which was written by Gen. Hal Moore himself and chronicles his first hand experience with this particular battle and other soldier's stories from another battle taking place almost immediately after this one. I would like to point out that about 80% of the events in the movie are completely historically false, and merely sought to Hollywoodize the movie. Scenes where Mel Gibson is charging across the battlefield are complete BS! If Hal Moore had really done that he would have either been 1) killed promptly or if he had somehow survived 2) courtmarshaled immediately after the battle for abandoning his duties as a general. A general's place is at his command post commanding his troops. Hal Moore rarely left his post, but I guess Mel Gibson doesn't really give a damn, he just wants to act all dramatic.There were some good things about this movie, while once again not keeping in the line with the book, the stories involving the army wives were somewhat intriguing, but since the fates of their husbands were for the large part completely fictional affairs, they fell flat for me. My suggestion is, if you want to get inside the head of a soldier, a commander, and a worried spouse at home during Vietnam, read the book We Were Soldiers Once and Young, if you don't want that, and you just want to see Mel Gibson in another mindless action movie, see this film.
