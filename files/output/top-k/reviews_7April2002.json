In the late 90s, there have been a resurgence of these films, such as the Scream movies, which started off good and then went sharply downhill with each additional sequel, Urban Legend, and I Know What You Did Last Summer (as well as, God willing, it's only sequel, I Still Know What You Did Two Summers Ago). Hollow Man is a film that takes a fantastic premise and reduces it to yet another of these cheap imitation slasher films. Sure, the whole invisible man thing has been done before. Done to death, if you include literary examples. But let's face it, the possibility of human invisibility is one of the most fascinating premises that you can possibly tell a story about. The unfortunate thing about Hollow Man was that no one involved with the making of the movie seemed to realize that. What you have here is the development of an invisibility serum (as well as a reversing visibility serum) by a brilliant scientist, who successfully uses it on a gorilla in some of the best special effects scenes to date, and then uses it on himself. Well, of course he uses it on himself, what scientist could possibly resist? And why would any scientist WANT to resist? Well, the reason may be that, evidently, invisibility serum turns even the most intelligent scientists into raving madmen. The absolutely infinite amount of possibilities for an invisible character are completely ignored here in favor of turning him into yet another bland faceless killer. This time, we may know who it is that's trying to kill people, but what we don't know is why he completely ignores the outside world. This is the greatest scientific discovery of mankind, and this bonehead decides to use it to become a peeping tom and to spy on his girlfriend. This vast and hugely unfortunate simplification of the potential for the story of an invisible man is both bitterly disappointing and more than a little insulting. As Roger Ebert mentions in his review of Hollow Man, it seems that director Paul Verhoeven, who directed such great films as RoboCop and Total Recall, seems to think that his audience is so intellectually dim that they prefer a mindless killer to the incredibly imaginative villain (or protagonist) that Dr. Sebastian Caine could have become. Hollow Man is an absolutely fascinating display of brilliant special effects, which seem to map out internal anatomy just as good as any medical textbook, and is also a great deal of fun as the visible characters desperately try to make Dr. Caine visible again, but it is a dismal failure on the story level. The film starts out with a gigantic amount of intelligence, both that required for the development of an invisibility serum and that involved in the brilliant premise of the story, but winds up in the end as nothing more than yet another mindless thriller, completely lacking in thought and intrigue.

It is fantasy at its best, is beautifully filmed, well written and well acted.  Anthony Hopkins, in particular, is fantastic.  And above all, when it comes to love, lightning should strike and we shouldn't settle. Some people (OK, most people) say this film is too long, and that is their biggest problem with it.  I think that's one of the films more prevalent attributes, so that's where I'll start.  Either you're into a film or you're not.  If you're not into it, even a 90 minute film can seem like an eternity if there's no action.  Camille, A.I., Me Myself and Irene and any James Bond movie fit that bill for me.  Therefore, this is one of those films where I won't argue with someone who doesn't like it.  It's impossible to like a film that can't sustain your interest.  Usually, unless it's just an obviously bad movie, the blame for this lies with the viewer.  However, I can concede that this film is not for all tastes and let the naysayers off the hook.I don't think the film is slow at all, I just think that Martin Brest took his time in allowing the story to unfold and the characters to develop.  Joe Black is very much a character study.  Most character studies only involve one person.  This one has two main characters and three or four more lesser characters who are all studied to one degree or another.  Cutting this film down to two hours would mean losing a lot of the insight we get into these characters.  No scene is rushed in this film.  All are allowed to develop at their own pace and continue on until they've said what they have to say.  It's a marvel, and an tribute to the film that the studio allowed it to be released at this length.  The decision makers must have had similar thoughts, or they would have chopped an hour off it.  After all, the far inferior original, Death Takes A Holiday, was less than 90 minutes, I believe.The cinematography for this film is absolutely beautiful.  It's not real hard to believe that the movie had such a large budget when you stop to notice how magnificent the settings are.Thoughts on the cast...Anthony Hopkins lends dignity and credibility to every film he's in.  His character represents another moral of this film, I think, that we should do as much in this life as possible before it's gone.  He, particularly, is the master of keep filming until I'm done talking in this film.  He's a careful man, and he chooses his words carefully.  He is not one to be rushed.  Neither is Death.  Brad Pitt certainly isn't the best thing about this film, but he doesn't hurt it any.  His take on the character is at least a fresh and interesting one.  And often funny.  Marcia Gay Harden is effective as the lesser loved daughter.  The first time I saw this film, I thought for sure Jeffrey Tambor would be a villain, as he always seems to be.  I was pleased to see him in a role as a weak, but essentially good man.  Claire Forlani is really what makes the wheels of this film turn, though.  After all, what is the premise of this film?  Death falls in love with a mortal woman.  How long has this guy been around?  How many women has he come across?  In other words, the girl better be pretty great.  One of the many weaknesses of Death Takes A Holiday is the girl that Death falls for, Evelyn Venable, is pretty weak.  I won't pretend Forlani is a modern day Katherine Hepburn, but she is incredibly beautiful and, in addition to portraying her character well, has a presence about her that Venable lacked.  She's believable as someone Death would fall for.  I guess.  How the hell do I know?  This film is a big throwback to the classic era.  I won't say it's Capraesque, since it digs a lot deeper into the characters than any of Frank's films, but the idealistic hero in an unrealistic situation is very reminiscent of Capra's films.Here's a thought that I can't really fit into any other paragraph, so I'll give it it's own.  Although the propensity of films to include an obligatory sex scene seems to have dwindled off in the last decade from it's ridiculous plateau in the 70's, I still tend to get annoyed by them in today's films.  Come on, it's the 21st century.  We know they're having sex, we don't need to see it for five minutes.  Every director seems to think he'll be the one to make his sex scene better than the others, or show us something we haven't seen hundreds of times already.  Almost always, they are wrong and the sex scene is tedious.  This film's scene is an exception.  First, it is different because we're talking about Death here.  But besides that, Brest films the scene just like he films the rest of the film.  Beautifully and slowly.  Most importantly, he concentrates the camera on facial expression, not naked bodies.  The ending is sappy and pours it on.  But I love it.  Go ahead and call me soft.  I love the fireworks.  I love the endless rendition of What a Wonderful World.  And I love the happy ending.Typically, I think remakes and new takes of\/on old films are inferior to the originals.  But this is the exception.  Meet Joe Black takes the far inferior Death Takes A Holiday much deeper.  Death Takes A Holiday portrays Death falling in love at first sight, and the whole film only lasts one night.  Fredric March is a great actor, but was extremely robotic in that role.  To do a story like this, the Death character needs to have a personality.  One of the many reasons this version is superior.

Brad Pitt certainly isn't the best thing about this film, but he doesn't hurt it any.  His take on the character is at least a fresh and interesting one.  And often funny.  Marcia Gay Harden is effective as the lesser loved daughter.  The first time I saw this film, I thought for sure Jeffrey Tambor would be a villain, as he always seems to be.  I was pleased to see him in a role as a weak, but essentially good man.  Claire Forlani is really what makes the wheels of this film turn, though.  After all, what is the premise of this film?  Death falls in love with a mortal woman.  How long has this guy been around?  How many women has he come across?  In other words, the girl better be pretty great.  One of the many weaknesses of Death Takes A Holiday is the girl that Death falls for, Evelyn Venable, is pretty weak.  I won't pretend Forlani is a modern day Katherine Hepburn, but she is incredibly beautiful and, in addition to portraying her character well, has a presence about her that Venable lacked.  She's believable as someone Death would fall for.  I guess.  How the hell do I know?  This film is a big throwback to the classic era.  I won't say it's Capraesque, since it digs a lot deeper into the characters than any of Frank's films, but the idealistic hero in an unrealistic situation is very reminiscent of Capra's films.Here's a thought that I can't really fit into any other paragraph, so I'll give it it's own.  Although the propensity of films to include an obligatory sex scene seems to have dwindled off in the last decade from it's ridiculous plateau in the 70's, I still tend to get annoyed by them in today's films.  Come on, it's the 21st century.  We know they're having sex, we don't need to see it for five minutes.  Every director seems to think he'll be the one to make his sex scene better than the others, or show us something we haven't seen hundreds of times already.  Almost always, they are wrong and the sex scene is tedious.  This film's scene is an exception.  First, it is different because we're talking about Death here.  But besides that, Brest films the scene just like he films the rest of the film.  Beautifully and slowly.  Most importantly, he concentrates the camera on facial expression, not naked bodies.  The ending is sappy and pours it on.  But I love it.  Go ahead and call me soft.  I love the fireworks.  I love the endless rendition of What a Wonderful World.  And I love the happy ending.Typically, I think remakes and new takes of\/on old films are inferior to the originals.  But this is the exception.  Meet Joe Black takes the far inferior Death Takes A Holiday much deeper.  Death Takes A Holiday portrays Death falling in love at first sight, and the whole film only lasts one night.  Fredric March is a great actor, but was extremely robotic in that role.  To do a story like this, the Death character needs to have a personality.  One of the many reasons this version is superior.

Haunted is one of the finest movies i've seen in many years, and it's really a shame that not many people have seen it.The cast is superb, with each character standing out, even those with just a couple lines (the fortune teller who reads David and Christina's palms is a good example). The stars, Aidan Quinn and Kate Beckinsale, are in excellent form, but Anthony Andrews steals the show in this one. He plays the character of Robert, the jealous and controlling big brother. There is a brilliant shot of his pale, depressed face surrounded by mocking darkness that perfectly defines the tortured-soul of the character. Anthony Andrews has such a strong, masculine English voice that makes him wonderful for all sorts of different roles. Just as entertaining is the younger brother, Simon (played by Alex Lowe), who is an obnoxious prankster with a playful soul. The late, great John Gielgud is also memorable in this movie for his portrayal of a kind, but mysterious doctor. Lewis Gilbert's direction is absolutely flawless, and i definately look forward to seeing his other films. Haunted is such an attractive movie everything looks so heavenly and enticing. In the daytime, Edbrook is such a charming place; a wonderful place to spend your childhood, but when night creeps up, it shows a perfect gothic presence. Haunted is probably the best ghost story i've ever experienced. It's unpredictable, charming, touching, frightening, and constantly entertaining. Perhaps my favorite scene is when David tries to trap a possible ghost outside of the Mariell mansion, and from out of nowhere, a cloud of dust spins in fascination. Soon after, a distorted ghost that sobs uncontrollably is conjured that floats away, beckoning David to follow it to the angry lake. This is one of the many truly magical moments found in this one-of-kind film. The sound effects are just as impressive as the visuals (the sounds of the howling wind and crashing rain are terrific).

Characters are introduced in the first 15 minutes, and we quickly learn to care less about anything that happens to these people for the rest of the movie. They aren't interesting, they aren't developed well, and I could hardly figure out anyone's motivations. For example Peggy (Laura Dern) apparently has a drinking problem. She's seen drinking wine and champagne throughout the movie, occasionally slurs, and even has one scene where she stumbles and falls in the good Doctor's office...and then that's it. We don't learn anymore about her or her drinking problem than that. Another example Connie (Tara Reid) keeps telling her dad (Richard Gere) that everything's okay with me...really, it is. at various times in the movie. For no reason at all. We have no knowledge of why she's saying that or any evidence that there's something else going on and she's really not okay and she's actually about to kill herself or something. There are many other instances such as these in the movie and it makes you say huh? more than a few times.In almost every scene involving 3 or more women throughout the entire movie, Robert Altman used some trick where he'd have all of the women talking at the same time, and would choreograph the scene so that you could still (more or less) follow the storyline. At first, it was mildly amusing to see all these women talking at once in the Doctor's office. After about the tenth time seeing women clucking infernally like hens in the Mall, the Dress store, Tiffany's, a bridal shower, etc, it became a teeth-clenching chore to watch and made me want to rip out somebody's larnyx just so they'd shutup. Hey, Altman, ever heard of enough is enough?Farrah Fawcett plays Dr. T's wife Kate, who goes crazy and strips naked in the mall, dancing around in the fountain at the beginning of the movie. She's eventually put into a mental hospital, where she stays throughout the rest of the movie. Nothing really happens with her and Dr. T never really shows much interest in trying to understand what's wrong with his wife or help her in any way. Instead, he ends up cheating on her with Bree (Helen Hunt), a golf instructor new to the town.If the first 3\/4 of the movie was barely tolerable, the last 1\/4 was absolutely, positively ludicrous. Let me tell you what happens, and you tell me if it sounds plausible1. At Daughter Dee Dee's (Kate Hudson's) outdoor wedding she suddenly decides, while standing at the altar, that she wants to be with her lesbian lover Marilyn (Liv Tyler) instead of marry her boyfriend.2. Meanwhile, it just started to rain on the wedding party. And not just any rain...a huge, stormy, thundering downpour. (seems to me that somebody having a outdoor wedding would have paid at least mild attention to the weather reports for their wedding day)3. While everyone is scrambling for cover from the rain, Carolyn (Shelley Long), Dr. T's long time office manager, runs up to him and says I've always wanted to be a pastry chef, so I'm quitting my job. Uh, right. This event doesn't seem the least bit preposterously stupid or out of place, does it?4. Dr. T suddenly decides that he wants to spend the rest of his life with Bree, whom he has known for maybe 2 or 3 romantic evenings. He rushes from the wedding, jumps in his car and drives to her house to tell her the good news. She rebuffs him, however, and he leaves in a huff.5. He's so upset about this ill turn of events that he drives out into the raging storm, where (inexplicably) there are no other cars on the usually crowded freeways around Dallas.6. But wait! Now he's suddenly driving toward a...a...TORNADO! Yes, that's right, no tornado watches in Texas, apparently, just a instant tornado. It get's better, though.7. He and his car get swept up in the tornado, twirled around so many times, then apparently dropped down somewhere in MEXICO! (so this tornado carried him at least 800 miles from Dallas to Mexico? bwahahaha!). Anyway, the storm clears.8. Some time later, 3 little spanish speaking girls find him laying near his car and they help him get to his feet (YOU MEAN HE'S STILL ALIVE?????????) and take him to their village where, as luck would have it, THE VILLAGERS HAPPEN TO NEED A GYNECOLOGIST JUST THIS VERY MINUTE! One of the local girls is having a baby and, even though none of them speak english (and he doesn't speak spanish) they all just happen to know he's a gynecologist, they let him come into their house, and wait for him to deliver the girl's baby (methinks that maybe they would have already had arrangements in place to have this baby delivered. I mean, they've had 9 months to organize themselves, right? Or maybe they were just expecting a gynecologist to magically fall out of the sky at the right moment).whew! This was absolutely unbelievable. What am I supposed to think about this movie, especially after the embarrassingly stupid ending?I thinks it stinks, and I'm going to hold a grudge for a long time about wasting my $4 and 2 hours on this horrible piece of junk movie.How could people have seriously given this movie a 5 out of 10 rating?? OMG, I feel like I'm doing charity just by giving this stinker a 1 out of 10 rating!-JamesDee ","genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance"},{"date":"7 April 2002","score":"","review":"  So what is the truth about Blade 2?
