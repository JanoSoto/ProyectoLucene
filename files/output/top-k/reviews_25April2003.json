Though the special effects looked cool, this movie still sucked and is what is wrong with the movie industry today.

It's actually quite entertaining. But it is pretty bad. I think it looks quite nice though. The cinematography is pretty nice. Most of the Visual Effects are good, so are the Sound Effects. The Aliens (the Psychlos, what a stupid name) have cool guns and look rather cool, apart from the way they sometimes have 6 fingers and sometimes only 5. And some of the framing is interesting. The problem with the film is that everything else is bad. All the characters in the film are pathetic and mostly badly acted. I really hate Terl (Travolta). He is such a boring character. Travolta overacts and seems completely unreal. He deserved the Razzie. Johnny, the hero character, is also a bit annoying and I don't like the way all of his friends apart from his stupid woman friend, who should die, die. My favourite character in the film is the Alien from the learning machine, who didn't even get credited. Some of the things people say in this film are just really annoying and stupid. Towards the end of the film Carlo starts saying `Piece a cake' all the time. This becomes a stupid joke. The Humans occasionally make weird monkey like noises, as if they had evolved into apes or something. And the Psychlos are always laughing and it's not even real laughing. It's just `Hahahaha. Haha.' laughing. After seeing this film three times, there are still some things I don't understand (Who is the guy with the weird neck supposed to be?). I think some stuff probably isn't explained in the film. Maybe it was edited out. Speaking of editing, the Star Wars style transition effects between some scenes are really unnecessary.

Our story starts off with a failed heist. Mr. White (Harvey Keitel) and the horribly wounded Mr. Orange (An excellent Tim Roth) escape to the hide out and meet up with Mr. Pink (Steve Buscemi) to try and figure out what went wrong with the heist. They slowly figure out who is the rat through stories of violence and betrayal. This movie is most famous for it's ear cutting scene but it's truly just another scene in the film. When you watch the film all through, the scene doesn't stand out much but still leaves a lasting impression. Of course, the real stand out of this film is the acting. Great actors such as Chris Penn, Michael Madsen and Lawrence Tierney all pop up and entertain us. To prove just how good the acting is Read the script and then watch the film. The script is entertaining and well written but it is the actors that really bring it to life. Quentin Tarantino has came up with a truly outstanding film that deserves all the praise that it has won over the ten years since it was released. Although Tarantino would go on to direct the superior 'Pulp Fiction' and the even better 'Jackie Brown', this film is his first film and a very impressive one at that.

I however, see all, and am big enough to push past that.Just about any movie that dares to come out with so much as the smallest recognized subversive point of view against anything, even cynicism, deserves a pat on the back.

The Bond girl here, Tatiana, is played well by Daniela Bianchi. She adds some interesting elements to the plot. This film is arguablly the most espionage out of any Bond film, but there are still several good action sequences. The two that come to mind the most are also in the list of best Bond action sequences. The first is the scene when the Helicopter chases Bond because it adds paranoia and fear that any minute he might get killed. The second is when Bond is being chased by the boats and he manages to destroy them quite ingeniously. Even though the fight between Grant and Bond on the train was good, it wasn't that exciting because it was rather short. The script is solid, but a bit faulty because there is too much mystery around the villians. Also Bond doesn't deliver any lines in this movie that stand- out, unlike Dr. No, Goldfinger, Goldeneye, etc. The direction by Terence Young is guiding enough to be very good, he pulls the cast together extremly well and if you watch the making of documentary on the special edition DVD, you'll see how he did it and why he did such a good job. The locations is another problem, Istanbul isn't exoctic enough for a Bond film.

One of the better rom-coms as of late and the best film yet pitching Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan (not that there's been many). However, there are some all-to-unavoidable flaws. There isn't that much humour present and for the most part, it substitutes charm for wit. It's never funny enough to make you laugh but it's never sentimental enough to really be taken seriously. Also, the film is too long. At 125 minutes, it would have been better had it been re-edited and packed the best bits into a welcome 90-minute fare. Thankfully, it isn't too cushy and sentimental and can be compared to modern life. Who better to cast as the two leads than Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks? They have that easy-on-the-eye quality that makes them a convincing couple. They also seem human in their respective roles and are convincing as business enemies aswell. The supporting cast isn't as fantastic but they hold the film together and most of them are good. Greg Kinnear was well cast as Meg Ryan's nerdy boyfriend. Unfortunately, Parker Posey doesn't really have much chemistry with Tom Hanks. Whether that's intentional or not? I don't know. Steve Zahn isn't usually suited to this sweet style of romance, but he's still a good (if not the only) source of comic relief.Given the scenario, predictability is inevitable but the fact that it takes till the very last scene for the realisation to occur is a bit of a drag. Usually in movies of this calibre, the premise occurs about three quarters the way through the movie. It's even a bit annoying the way it's made so blindingly obvious. But it's still an easily enjoyable and rather amusing little story. It doesn't push the limits of cinematic possibilities, but it's very good for what it's worth. I give it a 6.7\/10.

It taught that the Church's primary responsibility lay in solidarity with those who suffered most in this life, and that salvation did not lie simply in acts of faith, but also in acts of justice. Grassroots priests and lay pastors who, by virtue of their contact with the lives of their congregations, came to identify with their daily struggles, much as the Irons and De Niro characters did in the film.  The Mission is a clearly political film, and probably one that is intended to be so by its Director and Writer. It's undoubtedly a moving film, especially with its decidedly non-Hollywood ending, but I think that it's greatest political force is derived from its implicit commentary on the political climate into which it was released in 1986, and by extension, the political climate today.In 1985, the year before this film was released, Reagan declared that he would ignore a ruling of the World Court, the highest judicial body on the planet, and one whose judgements the US is bound to uphold. The ruling in question was one which ordered on the US to cease its Illegal use of Force (which is another term for international terrorism) and to pay $17 billion in reparations. The plaintiff in the case was Nicaragua, which was under attack by a proxy army armed, organized, and managed by the US. The Congress, for its part, announced immediately that our proxy army, the Contra, were explicitly authorized to attack what were called soft targets, namely undefended civilian targets such as schools, clinics, and churches. That is, our response to the charge of International Terrorism was to increase our International Terrorism.Nicaragua at the time was one of the few places in Latin America where the State actively supported Liberation Theology, which by then was very prevalent amongst lay Jesuit pastors throughout Central America. It's hardly a coincidence that so many Jesuits were killed by US proxies, especially in  El Salvador, where we even had the temerity to kill a conservative Archbishop who had dared to do his job and defend the pastors of his order. Far fewer died in Nicaragua, where the army actually acted to defend the population instead of attacking it.So while it's nice to admire the film for its various technical and artistic achievements, and it makes us feel good to lament the past history it purports to tell, for the film to become truly relevant, we'd need to make the connection to what is going on in the present, and more importantly, what we can do about it.The attack on Nicaragua succeeded, like most of the violent undertakings of the Home of the Brave.

While by no means the worst display of human cruelty I've ever seen, this one just grabs you in a way that few other films have. There are scenes in this that will literally have you on the edge of your seat, eyes unblinking. If you can only see one movie where Anthony Hopkins plays Hannibal Lecter, please look no further. This is where you see just how frightening Lecter actually is. He's not a joke like he was in the sequel, nor is he an uninspired rehash like in Red Dragon, which is funny when you think of Red Dragon as a prequel. I read a review of the film somewhere that stated how unsettling Lecter is in his stillness, almost as if he is an animal ready to attack. I couldn't have said it better. It is a nod to the fact that you may one day be sitting across from someone who may look normal on the outside and yet be a monster on the inside. There's just too much good stuff I have to say about this movie that I'm actually beginning to feel overwhelmed by it all. There are so many small nuances that you just can't catch them all in one viewing. It's in the little things like the expressions and such. I'll say this much, it is easily one of the best films I have ever seen, period. It deserved to sweep the Oscars that year. Even Hannibal (the film) couldn't ruin the memory of this film for me. Watch this, especially if you don't know too much about the story line. Rating ***** out of *****.

He spent the entire first film doing the right thing, because that's what good guys do. In this film, he gave up all that hero stuff so he could be selfish and have a life for himself. And the result almost enslaved humanity. This film shows Superman in a much more sympathetic light because we can see him struggle for the first time. He got his ass kicked in that diner, and he actually bled. He had to walk back to his Fortress of Solitude, which is in a crappy location if you have to walk.

The underlying theme, or subject of artistic representation of the film is perhaps self-doubt. The entire film is laced with some form of self-doubt on every level. Whether it is Iris who doubts that she ever met Miss Froy, or the nun, who cannot decide which side she is on, or Gilbert who in the end, is unable to remember the secret tune, thus he may have doubted his skills as a musician. This film, the Lady Vanishes is characteristical of Hitchcock, because within its theme, there are at least three things that make this a Hitchcock film.The first is Hitchcock's use of trains, this film not being the first time he has used trains in his picture. Hitchcock also used trains in his film 39 Steps and later in Strangers on a Train, Shadow of a Doubt, and North by Northwest among many others. Hitchcock loves to use trains, as they appear to symbolize unrest, industrialization, and uncertainty. Yet we can be certain that the events to unfold on any train were to be negative. It is as if the train foreshadows the notion that something `bad' is going to unravel. For those who are familiar with Hitchcock's films, one can look at 39 Steps in which the pursuit of Richard Hannay (Robert Donat) ensues, in Shadow of a Doubt, Uncle Charlie (Joseph Cotton) arrives in town on a train thus foreshadowing that `this is a bad thing'. Even in Strangers on a train, where Guy Haines (Farley Granger) and Bruno Anthony (Robert Walker) meet, this begins the unrest of their two involvements with each other. It is clear that Hitchcock uses the train as means to portray the antagonistic features of the film.The second stereotypical characteristic of this film is the plot itself; the plot against the government, the protagonist Iris Henderson (Margaret Lockwood) and the antagonist, Dr. Hartz (Paul Lukas), in which a common person discovers and foils a plot against the government. It is often stereotypical that this protagonist also takes on a counterpart of opposite sex. All these characteristics can also be seen in such film as the 39 Steps in which Richard Hannay gets involved in a plot against the government, and North by Northwest, in which Roger Thornhill (Cary Grant) too gets unsuspectedly involved in a plot against the government. Hitchcock loves the use of spies and secret agents, as used in many of his films, but more than that, he loves to build relationships under extreme circumstances with complete strangers.Strangers who fall in love are very typical of Hitchcock. His women always sophisticated and beyond their time. Even Margaret Lockwood can compare to women of our time. In Lady Vanishes, the short relationship between Iris and Gilbert becomes more important than her previous relationship with her fiancé. In many of Hitchcock's films, the woman or man strays away from their original partner. Like Alice White (Anny Ondra) chooses the artist over the Detective, and John Ferguson (James Stewart) falls in love with Madeleine (Kim Novak) over Midge in Vertigo, Mrs. Verloc (Sylvia Sidney) falls for the young detective Ted Spencer (John Loder) while straying away from her husband Mr. Karl Anton Verloc (Oskar Homolka). All of Hitchcock's films seem to have this sub plot, where lovers meet and fall in love. When Gilbert begins humming the Wedding march rather than the secret code, this could perhaps be some foreshadowing of things to come. Hitchcock's love for women is perhaps why every starring actress in his films are refined and beyond their time.One of the styles that Hitchcock used to portray different feeling throughout the film was his lighting. For example, Hitchcock always used a darker lighting tone when he was portraying Dr. Hartz. This contrast of light and dark typifies the contrast between good and evil.The entire film is laced in humor, from the two gentlemen concerned about cricket, to Gilbert, an amusing counterpart.This film is beyond its time, in both its characters and its style.
