I do all the time. Well, with The Sum of All Fears, that is exactly what they have done...and the result is surprisingly bad. Affleck aside, there are some really terrific actors on screen in this film. None get more than 4-5 lines, not enough to make us care about their characters. Entirely too much time is wasted on Ryan's asinine relationship with his Sandra Bullock-look-alike girlfriend. Not enough time is given to the truly exciting events which take place a nuclear device detonated on American soil, a US aircraft carrier attacked, a Russian airbase leveled.  All three of these events take up less than 5 minutes of screentime, which is about the same amount of time we waste on one scene between Ryan and his girlfriend in the bedroom.  Another fault the movie has no climax. You could tell everybody in the audience was waiting for a REAL climax they were tense, still waiting for the big roller coaster ride at the end of the film (it never came). Overall, a dismal production and not anywhere near as good as Ryan's first outing (The Hunt for Red October).

Al Pacino, of course, is one of the greatest actors of all time and can always be counted on for an enjoyable performance. Just as pleasing is Robin Williams who absolutely holds his own opposite Pacino. I have always liked Robin Williams as a comedian and his more recent roles in movies such as Good Will Hunting, What Dreams May Come and Bicentennial Man are quickly establishing him as a talented dramatic actor, as well. One of the things that made this movie a treat was the great chemistry between Williams's Walter Finch and Pacino's Will Dormer. Both characters are utterly believable in their roles and they play off one another quite well.The other performances range from passable to quite good. Hillary Swank gave a decent performance as Ellie Burr, a stars-in-her-eyes admirer of Pacino's character and Jonathan Jackson gave a surprisingly good if somewhat under-written performance as Randy Stetz.The main plot is entertaining and interesting and is helped along by the did Will Dormer murder his partner sub-plot.No movie is perfect and Insomnia has its flaws. One is the use of the spinning moving camera that seems to be gaining popularity in modern film. I have a strong suspicion that this is used to avoid having to pay people to choreograph the action scenes. The camera gets right in on where the action is happening and then moves around wildly while the characters on screen grunt and jump about. Very annoying. If you want a fight or a foot chase, please let us see what is going on. Fortunately, Insomnia makes sparing use of this technique but it is present. Also, the film spends a little too much time convincing us of how tired Dormer is. The show him tossing and turning in bed, hallucinating and sweating but it isn't very believable. He has supposedly been awake for six days straight but the only real effect on his actions is that he goes around looking sleepy all the time.** Warning Minor spoiler(s) ahead **Sadly, the single worst thing about this movie is the ending. It's as if the producers decided at the last minute to fire the writing staff and hire a graduate from the Hollywood School of Schmaltzy and Nonsensical Endings. Ellie is supposed to visit the bad guy (who she does not know is the bad guy) to pick up some letters from the deceased girl. So far so good. However, when she gets there, the bad guy clocks her on her dome and drags her to the back room. Where he leaves her. Alone. And not very well secured.This entire plot development is lame and unnecessary. the protagonist (Pacino) already has PLENTY of motivation to go back to the killer's cabin and this twist does nothing to further the story. The bad guy has spent an entire movie craftily manipulating the police and casting suspicion on someone else. The police have totally bought it and have the person they think is guilty under lock and key at the jail. The bad guy is in the clear, so what does he do? He attacks a cop who everyone in the entire police department know has gone to see him. The excuse for this idiotic behavior? She saw the dead girl's dress in his cabin. However, the only reason she saw the dress was because the bad guy opened the drawer right in front of her and then left it open while he wandered around the room.I like the movie, so I didn't go out of my way to make that last bit sound too bad, but it is. However, it pales in comparison to the weak and contemptible way in which this movie's writers resolve all the sub-plots and issues revolving around Al Pacino's character. They spend a whole movie building intrigue around Will Dormer; his past cases, his problems with Internal Affairs and whether or not he murdered his partner. Then, in the last two minutes of the movie they dispose of all those problems in the most pathetically convenient way imaginable. I cannot begin to tell you how unsatisfying the ending of this movie is. It almost ruins an otherwise very enjoyable film.All in all, I am not sad that I spent time and money to see this film, but I am almost angry at the filmmakers for the disrespect they show for the viewer in the film's resolution.6\/10 because of the lame last five minutes of the movie. 8\/10 if the ending doesn't bother you.

I'm sure Christopher Nolan probably would've answered Erik Skjoldbjaerg's 'Insomnia'. The problem is that Nolan took the question literally. Instead of admiring Skjoldbjaerg's film, he attempted to make it again.What happened to the great director of Memento? Did he really sell his soul to the Hollywood machine? Fans and critics would certainly hope otherwise, but unfortunately, from watching Nolan's Insomnia it seems like the British filmmaking prodigy has gone completely mainstream.Nolan's Insomnia is a heavily Americanized version of Skjoldbjaerg's femomenal Norwegian film. And when I say Americanized, I'm not just talking about the movie taking place in Alaska. Oh no, I'm talking about all the melodrama and glitter of Hollywood movies that are so difficult to avoid on the big screen nowadays. Subplots are introduced to spice up the story, relationships between characters are changed, all the original subtlety is gone, and the two principal characters lack all original depth and are pigeonholed into the Hollywood good guy - bad guy scheme.In the original Insomnia, the cop character (his name was Jonas Engstrom but I will refer to him as the cop, to avoid confusion) was a Swedish detective who was sent to northern Norway to investigate a murder. Through an overheard conversation, we find out that back in Stockholm he got intimately involved with a young witness from a case he was working on. So his assignment in Norway was a sort of punishment. In the movie, this is mentioned only once and never again. In the American version, a whole subplot about Internal Affairs investigations is introduced and it has a great affect on the relationships in the movie. In the original film, the cop and his partner are great friends. In the remake, there is a hostility between them because of the whole Internal Affairs investigation going on back in Los Angeles. So in the original movie when the cop shoots his partner accidentally, it is primarily the guilt of shooting his friend that he has to deal with.Another aspect that is completely downplayed in Nolan's version is the cop's sense of alienation in a foreign land. In the original, the cop is a Swede. He is perceived as a foreigner and an outsider throughout his entire investigation. He is never accepted; in fact, he is often ridiculed for his accent by both cops and civilians. In Nolan's film, the cop is quickly accepted by the locals. We see them chatting away about guns, drinking beer together, and at the end we get the feeling like they're almost sad to see him go.Nolan gave Hilary Swank much more screen time then her character had in the original. In Skjoldbjaerg's Insomnia, the female cop merely investigates the second murder, but never interferes with the original investigation. Yes, she does figure out that the cop shot his partner, but she doesn't do anything about it. In the American version, we see her trying to arrest the real murderer, only to be incapacitated by him - and then Al Pacino, of course, has to come to the rescue.And finally, the biggest difference between the two movies is that the character of the cop (Will Dormer\/Jonas Engstrom) has been completely polished up in the American remake. In the remake, Al Pacino plays a good cop who uses some illegal methods to bring bad guys to justice (planting evidence and such). But hey, as long as he's reeling in bad guys, it's all good, right? ) He doesn't believe in political mumbo-jumbo, he only wants to do his job right. When a local teenage girl (and best friend of the murdered girl) tries to seduce him, he wisely avoids it and instead teaches her a lesson. He despises the murderer and he tries to prevent the murderer from framing an innocent kid. In the end, he dies like a hero, killing the bad guy and saving Hillary Swank's integrity. Damn. That's one good cop!Now let's take a look at Stellan Skarsgard's interpretation of the cop character. We find out early he's already been in trouble for being unable to cross a line between his work and his private life. When he shoots his friend accidentaly, he panics and covers up his crime, but he never considers telling the truth. His only concern is his own job - he has no other motives. Remember that scene in the American version where Al Pacino shoots a dead dog in an alley? Well, Stellan Skarsgard shoots a live dog! Take that, ASPCA! Furthermore, he frames the innocent young man himself, without any assistance from the real murderer. He tries to take advantage of a young girl in his car. When talks to the murderer, we don't get the feeling that he despises him. No, we get the feeling that he understands him. And finally, in the end, he does kill the real murderer, but he doesn't die himself. His own crime is covered up and he returns to Sweden. He is a cop with many flaws. And as such, he makes a much stronger character. The point of Skjoldbjaerg's movie was to erase the line between cop and criminal. There's no good guy and bad guy in his movie. It's a psychological thriller, where the suspense isn't derived from chase sequences across timber logs, but from the complexity of the main character.These are such fundamental differences between the two versions. If you change the characters, change the relationships and change the outcome, you've pretty much created a completely different movie. And as good as Nolan's movie is as a standalone project, as a remake it utterly fails because it takes away from the original all the qualities that made it such a great film. It is unfortunate for Nolan that he has wasted his time remaking an already great film. If this was his way of proving his skills, it was completely unnecessary. We already knew that he was a talented director. But hopefully this movie will get Nolan the money and the attention that he needs in order to create a truly excellent and ORIGINAL movie - one that we can all appreciate on its own.See Erik Skjoldbjaerg's Insomnia. See Christopher Nolan's Insomnia. They're both fine films, but Skjoldbjaerg's film definitely has the edge - there's no doubt about it.P.S. Did I get that right, or did Al Pacino's character really not sleep for 6 days straight? Isn't that humanly impossible? In the original movie, I'm pretty sure Stellan Skarsgard gets some sleep occasionally. He is chronically tired, that's true, but he's not a walking zombie. Nolan, as a writer himself, must know all about insomnia, as I'm sure he's had quite a few insomniac nights himself. But he should also equally well know that after 24 hours without sleep, fatigue will catch up with anyone, regardless of the amount of light coming into your room or the number of cops you've accidentally killed.

He despises the murderer and he tries to prevent the murderer from framing an innocent kid. In the end, he dies like a hero, killing the bad guy and saving Hillary Swank's integrity. Damn. That's one good cop!Now let's take a look at Stellan Skarsgard's interpretation of the cop character. We find out early he's already been in trouble for being unable to cross a line between his work and his private life. When he shoots his friend accidentaly, he panics and covers up his crime, but he never considers telling the truth. His only concern is his own job - he has no other motives. Remember that scene in the American version where Al Pacino shoots a dead dog in an alley? Well, Stellan Skarsgard shoots a live dog! Take that, ASPCA! Furthermore, he frames the innocent young man himself, without any assistance from the real murderer. He tries to take advantage of a young girl in his car. When talks to the murderer, we don't get the feeling that he despises him. No, we get the feeling that he understands him. And finally, in the end, he does kill the real murderer, but he doesn't die himself. His own crime is covered up and he returns to Sweden. He is a cop with many flaws. And as such, he makes a much stronger character. The point of Skjoldbjaerg's movie was to erase the line between cop and criminal. There's no good guy and bad guy in his movie. It's a psychological thriller, where the suspense isn't derived from chase sequences across timber logs, but from the complexity of the main character.These are such fundamental differences between the two versions. If you change the characters, change the relationships and change the outcome, you've pretty much created a completely different movie. And as good as Nolan's movie is as a standalone project, as a remake it utterly fails because it takes away from the original all the qualities that made it such a great film. It is unfortunate for Nolan that he has wasted his time remaking an already great film. If this was his way of proving his skills, it was completely unnecessary. We already knew that he was a talented director. But hopefully this movie will get Nolan the money and the attention that he needs in order to create a truly excellent and ORIGINAL movie - one that we can all appreciate on its own.See Erik Skjoldbjaerg's Insomnia. See Christopher Nolan's Insomnia. They're both fine films, but Skjoldbjaerg's film definitely has the edge - there's no doubt about it.P.S. Did I get that right, or did Al Pacino's character really not sleep for 6 days straight? Isn't that humanly impossible? In the original movie, I'm pretty sure Stellan Skarsgard gets some sleep occasionally. He is chronically tired, that's true, but he's not a walking zombie. Nolan, as a writer himself, must know all about insomnia, as I'm sure he's had quite a few insomniac nights himself. But he should also equally well know that after 24 hours without sleep, fatigue will catch up with anyone, regardless of the amount of light coming into your room or the number of cops you've accidentally killed.

While not a perfect sequel, it is above average compared to most horror movie sequels. We follow Damien on the verge of becoming a teenager, as forces around him begin to make way for his foretold rise to power, and the pieces of the puzzle begin to fall into place. The Thorn family is portrayed with excellency once again here, as we see Damien's interactions with his aunt and uncle and cousin Mark. The story flows along nicely, which is a strong point this sequel has. Despite moments of dull, slow pacing, it manages to keep you interested. The movie almost plays like a coming-of-age story rather than a horror movie. Damien is just beginning to uncover his destiny, learning more about his place in the world and what's to come. A good deal of time is spent on the Thorn family business, giving us a taste of what's to come for young Damien. The idea that the antichrist is the nephew of a rich and powerful businessman, attending a wealthy academy is somewhat creepy. One thing that seems to have no basis in the film, however, is the fact that everyone sees Damien as somewhat of a bad seed. Where this notion came about is beyond me, because at no point in the film is Damien uncontrollable or anything resembling a problem child. In fact, he carries on quite calmly, delivering his dialogue with a tranquil oddity that hints that something is a little off with him. Lacking the stylish direction of its predecessor, the film still manages to unfold the tale of Damien's self-realization and acceptance of destiny very well. A few odd deaths come every so often, to those who suspect Damien's true nature, and don't really serve the plot much purpose. One thing that makes the film great, though, is the lack of a villain. Never in the film is Damien portrayed as an absolutely evil and malevolent force. In fact, we somewhat feel for him and what he's going through. Damien isn't the one killing people here (at least not in the first hour) and he's not acting out violently, going on killing sprees for the hell of it. This film does well to portray the purity of evil, and the fact that it can reside in the embodiment of a boy. Despite a few over-the-top deaths, this film carries on what The Omen did by not over-milking the story with upside down crosses and images of demons or gargoyles. It's all very realistic and manages to scare us with what we don't see. Watch this film to see Damien slowly succumbing to his fate, and see by the end of the film how it changes him. While not a superbly crafted film, it's well above average for a horror sequel and carries on the legacy of Damien Thorn perfectly.

It isn't constantly being bombarded with loads of stupid humor. Freddie Prinze, Jr. plays a nerdy, book-worm student as opposed to playing a super-jock in SHE'S ALL THAT. *MINOR SPOILERS* Ryan (Prinze) and Jennifer (Claire Forlani) first met on an airplane when they were fourteen. Then, after that, they seperated for four years until they reconnected in high school. After that, they seperated for four more years. And, then the two finally reconnected again in college. And when they do, they discover that they have true feelings for each other.Jason Biggs is probably the worst thing to happen to this movie. He tries so very hard to act crazy and wild and to be all I don't understand why people don't like me!. But you can tell right away that it is all so very stupid. The humorous moments between Ryan and Claire is what creates some of the funny moments. Jason Biggs just adds to the idiocy of the film.

He tries so very hard to act crazy and wild and to be all I don't understand why people don't like me!. But you can tell right away that it is all so very stupid.

","genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance"},{"date":"1 June 2002","score":"","review":"  Spiderman may have been just what everyone needed.  Some things it gets away with and some mistakes that become forgiven are marginal (such as moment when dialogue and acting were sub-par) are what I would normally say to expect out of a film like this, but then of course Batman proves it wrong.  Then there are the things that are on-par and noticeably fine, do the right things, and are necessary to the story.  Things such as Peter designing his costume, could certainly have been better, but weren't bad. And finally, there are the things that are superior, just beyond superior; then last shot of the movie could very well be one of the five most awesome moments in any action film, or film in general for that matter.  The space-cam techniques are incredible and deserve all the recognition they've gotten so far. Tobey Maguire is quite good as Peter Parker, only seeming to have missed ten years of sleep at a couple of moments as opposed to other films where he can seem like that the whole movie.  William Defoe is especially good when around the other principles, acting as a normal citizen, but the Goblin...I'm not so sure.  The laugh is good, the original intentions for his evil are very well done, and him talking to himself to show the insane side of himself are ok, but there are definitely several things very wrong with this villain.  The fact that he's insane is one, you question whether he should be killed or put in a hospital.  His mask and dialogue to match the mask are another, they are quite lame, which I would say is all you can expect, but the Joker from Batman proves otherwise.  Also, he gets his revenge early, and has really no evil scheme or idea after that, it's just sort of pointless.  Kirsten Dunst made me smile throughout the entire thing, and believe it or not, get rather emotional at the end, her presence is enough to light up the screen but she goes the extra mile to win the entire audience. Danny Elfman's score is great, with a solid theme and the most adreneline rushing sequences of music to match with the untouchable action. And the action is so free, you get the ultimate rush watching such an agile being put himself at such dangerous heights, only to freely swing to another.  Spiderman is a pleasure to watch, and really gives an exhilarating feeling of freedom, in both the characters, and of course the action.
