I love Hitchcock, and everything he has contributed to cinema, but something about this film transcends what he has contributed.  I have read the critiques of those who dislike it, and I can totally understand.  This is not Hitchcock's normal standard, it's not the edge of your seat thriller(well, not all of it), and the pace is dogged at points.  But when I sit back and watch this, I cannot help but sit back and be entranced by the pure beauty of this film.  The bridge shot, the redwoods, the revolving kiss, all are incredible, lasting images.  The delicately provocative and yet eerily haunting music is unforgettable.  And like these ideas, the theme of being haunted, plagued by some phantom ideal such as mislaid love that emcompasses every moment of your life, the obsession and self-mutilation that everyone endures because of it - every romantic can sympathize with these themes.  One thing that is often overlooked is the depth of Stewart's character, and the emotional heights which he is more afraid to fall from than tangible heights in his own life.  And when he DOES fall, and he realizes to what depths he has been tricked, he snaps, not realizing that Novak's character has as well fallen with him.  His depravity and obsession with the truth at the end as they climb the stairs is one of the greatest scenes in film - he overcomes his actual fear of heights and confronts his emotional downfall, just as the the personification of both his previous weaknesses and what helped him to overcome them.  The final image of Stewart standing atop that tower, the shadow of death tolling the bell as he looks down upon what he has lost to his vertigo, is so disturbing and haunting that it brings me to tears every time I watch it.  This is my favorite movie of all time, not simply because of any one specific element, but because it inspires in me something unexplainable, like looking at a painting or listening to poetry, only one-hundred times more potent.  I hope in another forty years the greatness of this film will be truly recognized by everyone, but if not, I'll still be watching it.

Watching this version of Key Largo more than proves Welles' point; the lighting becomes terrible in several key scenes, particularly the closing ones on the boat, to whereas before, you could see what was going on, now you can just barely tell a thing. That said, it can't destroy the fine work that this film truly is.I was led to this film by my mother, who called it one of her favorites from Bogie (another being The African Queen) and now I can see why. Leave it to John Huston, the man who was bold enough to make a true adaptation of Dashiell Hammet's The Maltese Falcon, to give us a tightly woven drama that never feels forced. Bogie's Frank McCloud is probably the most silent of all the strong-silent types he ever played, barely saying more than is necessary for the scene he's in. Such reticience leaves some large blanks for the audience to fill; though he says that he doesn't care one way or another, I really don't believe him. The feeling I get the entire time he's in the clutches of Johnny Rocco's gang is that he's just waiting for his moment. After all, you don't survive WWII's Italian campaign and not know when it's best to stay still and when it's best to make your play. That's why he threw away the gun offered to him by Rocco; no way was Rocco's gang just going to let their boss be gunned down even if the deck was stacked in Rocco's favor. The murders of the deputy and the Indians on the lam just adds to the need to take care of business.I was a little disappointed to see Bacall in such a minor role (it still had to be better than what she was given, sans Bogie, after this film, from reports I've heard), but her spitting in Rocco's face is an undeniably powerful moment. As for Edward G. Robinson, one of Hollywood's original tough guys imported from Bucharest, Romania, he literally runs away with the part of Johnny Rocco, the former big-shot with delusions of grandeur. He's a casually vicious, ruthless fount of hate, bitter over his fallen status and hungering for a comeback. But he still fails to draw an important lesson from his soused ex-galpal times change and not necessarily for the better. He may have defied a ton of police in his day or gun down a deputy in this one, but it still doesn't change the fact that the outside world (nicely symbolized by the hurricane) can and will eat him alive without the slightest trace of indigestion. All Rocco is is a dinosaur proud, strong, but too stupid to realize that his kind have become extinct.In fact, that may very well be why McCloud was such a natural match for Rocco as an opponent. McCloud had changed his spots many times in his life to fit the job situation he was in, while Rocco has never been anything else but what he is now. Small wonder that one can see the confrontation between them coming to full steam. This core element, and all the others mentioned and not mentioned here, help make Key Largo one of the great unsung classics of Humphrey Bogart AND Edward G. Robinson.

I don't know if this is or not the best movie of 1999, but, as for me, IT WAS. The greatest I saw  (that year), for sure. Very intelligent. This is not `Vertigo' or  `Scream', Why to compare?  It's something totally different. Of course, people who is too busy confronting it with another films, searching clues or waiting for scarecrows, will hardly appreciate the GENUINE FRIGHTFUL situation of a child who is feeling totally alone in THIS world. The only people who take him serious, are all DEAD and angry. No one is there to take off his fear. Not even his mother can do anything, because of his silence and because she's got two jobs, no helping hand and a small son smarter than she. All the time you wonder if he is going to become into another Vincent Grey. THAT'S HORROR,  and that's drama. I wasn't so much smart I didn't guess the end.

But they're looking for Cole's help, because they have died with fright or anger, and estimating that they could die. Instead, Malcolm died with GUILT. He's desire of bring help to Cole, it's stronger than his need of help. He had never estimated his death, he didn't see the gun before than Vincent's shot. He don't know or don't care about the bullet hole, so he don't show it, he can't. (I suppose that a ghost must look like its own idea of it self) He's neither angry or MAD, so why it supposes to be cold before the end??? (or when he suspects about his wife, of course) And, after all, how can you be sure it wasn't cold? It's really necessary to show lots of people in shiver with the cold of one only ghost?? I mean, in the restaurant or in the theater. It would be stupid. On the other hand, Cole really needs someone trustworthy. After all, he is just a child, and Malcolm is not like a ghost supposes to be, so, even if he notice something, he is who has to believe what he want , in this case.Anyway, if you remember their leave-taking, you can wonder how much did Cole really know about him.Now, think about this This has to be a great movie if people still talks about it this way. Still spends money and time on it (THIS WAY). Shyamalan is so very intelligent. He made a masterpiece of the late 90's. A turning point. He knows how to play with our mind (nicely) and, obviously, he knows what people wants. This is a simple but powerful story.And, anything else why all this prejudice about Bruce Willis? He's not a bad or less actor. He's really good doing he's part, what ever he play. This is a good performance, but is not his best. And neither a surprise.

However, over time (and by having seen the rest of the movies and learning a great deal about them) i have been put off by the lukewarm reviews given to A View To A Kill by critics and other fans. So, does Roger Moore go out with a bang in this film or is he put out by a fire extinguisher?.Roger Moore's age is probably his greatest disadvantage in A View To A Kill. You could say that this time he is somewhat laughable therefore as a British Secret Service agent but as the film goes on you tend to become used to Moore's overaged (only as 007 of course)looks.  His peformance?.  Well, it doesn't match up to the excellent one he gave in the previous film, Octopussy, but was that down to him or the script?.Although most tend to give a shake of the head to A View To A Kill, Christopher Walken and Grace Jones were definetly among it's best offerings as the splendid villans, Zorin and Mayday.  As fans as said, Zorin is arguably the most psychotic to date and Walken plays him with enormous menace and although Grace Jones may not be a particulary great actress, she does indeed have a strong presence as the mysterious, almost-silent, Mayday.It seems as though everyone dislikes the character of Stacey Sutton (Tanya Roberts). Poorly played by the model, she remains today as the least inspired or interesting of Bond's ladies but definetly the most annoying. JAMES!, JAMES!, HELP ME, JAMES!!!. And of course, there was Patrick Macnee.  This truly wonderful actor played the role of Bond's ally, Sir Godfrey Tibbet, with a large hunk of charm and shared superb chemistry from Roger Moore (possibly because they shared the screen together before in 1976 as Holmes, played by Moore, and Watson in 'Sherlock Holmes In New York').  Tibbet was sadly executed by Mayday but remains one of 007's best allies and gave Macnee another chance to show his superior skills as quitensential English gentleman like he had done in the unbeatable, TV classic, 'The Avengers'.Although i have just quickly gone over the main characters in A View To A Kill, i will give my honest opinion of Roger Moore's 007 swansong today. When you look at it as a movie, it's quite good and works welll, if not imaginatively, with the James Bond formula.

Scream 3 was definitely suffering from multiple genre syndrome. It simply did not fit neatly into any category. Allow me to explain.For all you absolute gore-loving horror fans out there, this movie will be a big disappointment. Very little blood and relatively tame violence (by today's standards) make this a walk in the park compared to, let's say, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. I know that's an old example, but hey...If you are the type who prefers more of a psychological thriller, for example, Silence of the Lambs, then you will probably love Scream 3. The truth is, it DOES provide plenty of scares and shocks. But they are all implied, a la Blair Witch. So as a thriller, it really works.Then again, if you are a Poirot-loving, Columbo-watching mystery fanatic, who loves to solve obscure crimes, don't bother with Scream 3. I HATE whodunnits, yet figured out the mystery sub-plot after an hour. OK, so I picked the wrong person\/people, but that's not the point. So if you are the kind who guesses murderers after five minutes, avoid it like the plague.But, as always, Scream 3 does have another saving grace its humour\/humor (notice that little trans-Atlantic touch?). The film is packed full of jokes, sly references to celebrities, nods to the audience about horror films, etc, etc. Not to mention a couple of excellent cameos. It's a good film to see if you like comedy. Sort of like... well, there is nothing to compare it to. Dewey is absolutely hilarious.For me personally, the film did end up a touch contrived. I was absolutely hooked for the first hour or so. As soon as the Final Act began, it got silly. When they have to resort to killing off four characters in the space of twenty minutes, you know something is wrong.I don't think there will ever be a Scream 4. I don't want there to be. I don't even want there to be a Halloween H20-type reunion in twenty years time. It was a nice series while it lasted, but it's gone now.This film is the final one of a trilogy that managed to create a whole new genre. Scream was excellent. Scream 2 was good. Scream 3 has an excellent cast, a good premise, and a bad ending.To sum upIf you love HORROR, catch it on video. If you love THRILLERS, see it, it's excellent. If you love MYSTERY, read a book instead. If you love COMEDY, this one's a hoot. If you love SCREAM, see it, but with a fresh perspective.

So as a thriller, it really works.Then again, if you are a Poirot-loving, Columbo-watching mystery fanatic, who loves to solve obscure crimes, don't bother with Scream 3. I HATE whodunnits, yet figured out the mystery sub-plot after an hour. OK, so I picked the wrong person\/people, but that's not the point. So if you are the kind who guesses murderers after five minutes, avoid it like the plague.But, as always, Scream 3 does have another saving grace its humour\/humor (notice that little trans-Atlantic touch?). The film is packed full of jokes, sly references to celebrities, nods to the audience about horror films, etc, etc. Not to mention a couple of excellent cameos. It's a good film to see if you like comedy. Sort of like... well, there is nothing to compare it to. Dewey is absolutely hilarious.For me personally, the film did end up a touch contrived. I was absolutely hooked for the first hour or so. As soon as the Final Act began, it got silly. When they have to resort to killing off four characters in the space of twenty minutes, you know something is wrong.I don't think there will ever be a Scream 4. I don't want there to be. I don't even want there to be a Halloween H20-type reunion in twenty years time. It was a nice series while it lasted, but it's gone now.This film is the final one of a trilogy that managed to create a whole new genre. Scream was excellent. Scream 2 was good. Scream 3 has an excellent cast, a good premise, and a bad ending.To sum upIf you love HORROR, catch it on video. If you love THRILLERS, see it, it's excellent.

And I had every right to be, living in the United Kingdom and subsequently having to wait three months.Anyway, the film did NOT disappoint my expectations. Yet it did not exceed them. Scream 3 was definitely suffering from multiple genre syndrome. It simply did not fit neatly into any category. Allow me to explain.For all you absolute gore-loving horror fans out there, this movie will be a big disappointment. Very little blood and relatively tame violence (by today's standards) make this a walk in the park compared to, let's say, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.
