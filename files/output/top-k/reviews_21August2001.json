I thought the humour got very old very fast and there wasn't enough good humour in it to satisfy those expecting something similar to Zucker's other efforts.  But having said that, let me say this.  Rat Race does one thing tremendously well and that is it never stops trying.  I don't think I have seen a film where almost every scene has the potential to be funny.  Many and most comedies just take their linear route and go from point A to point B and try to put in some humourous situations along the way.  Well Rat Race is ubiquitous in it's attempt to humour us.  Every scene is ripe with potential and I would only guess that if this is your type of comedy, then you will enjoy this film.  There is everything from Jon Lovitz inadvertently looking and sounding like Hitler just as he ends up on stage in a WWII veterans ceremony.  We also have Rowan Atkinson and Wayne Knight chasing after a heart after it has fallen out of a window.  You have fathers that make their little girls put their bums out the window and go while the car is still moving because of greed.  You have Whoopi Goldberg and her daughter acting like mentally handicapped people after they get off of the fastest car in the world and you have Cuba Gooding Jr. driving a bus full of winy Lucille Ball look alikes.  There is also Seth Green and his brother chasing after a cow and a hot air balloon as it almost takes out a bus.  Now if this is something that sounds appealing to you, then I guess you should rush to see this film.  There is enough humour in here to satisfy everyone and this is coming from a guy that didn't even like it that much.  If you happen to dislike this kind of comedy, then avoid like the plague. I found Rat Race to be unfunny but I can't really tell you why.  The jokes were fast and frenzied and most of the audience, including my wife, was laughing quite hysterically but I just didn't see the humour.  But as I said, if what is described above sounds funny, then you will probably appreciate the film in some or all regards.Rat Race is about a bunch of people that have to get to a bag that contains two million dollars in it.  A casino owner gets all of best betting customers together to wager on the contestants along the way.  While the race is on, we cut back every once in a while to the bettors to see what silly practices they are betting on next.  In one of the funnier scenes, Dave Thomas tells a call girl that he wants to get naked with her in a pool of Pepto Bismol and have her wear a cowboy hat and lick her feet while she shaves his butt.  She looks at him in a queer manner and then finally replies that she will do it for $3000.00  From behind the curtains all the bettors appear and they begin handing over money to the man that bet closest to $3000.00.  These guys are shameless and will bet on anything.Rat Race is a review that I am actually having trouble finishing.  I know I disliked this film immensely yet when I think about it, I know that it is zany and quite off the wall and that scores points in my books.  Maybe I was in a bad mood that day, maybe I just didn't get the humour or maybe it is really as bad as I say it is.  Whatever.

When I was finished watching the film I was left completely speechless.  I couldn't actually find the words to describe it.  I'll give it a try now.    On technical aspects of the movie, everything was solid.  It was a very beautiful film to look at.  Shot in black and white, there was very little color, except at the very end of the movie.  Also, a little color is inserted into the film highlighting the often mentioned girl in the red dress.  It is a beautiful scene, but I am a little unclear as what the symbolism of it actually was.  Even being unclear about it, one theory I saw was that it highlighted her as an individual, and in doing so it creates and individual story, showing that every person there was an individual in and of themselves.  I'm not sure if that is true, but it makes sense.  I often found myself wondering about her fate, so my theory is that Spielberg gave us a person to wonder about, if they had lived or died.  Then we may feel like all the Jewish families who were not positive of the fate of there loved ones until much later on.      There are way too many powerful, and at times sad and disturbing scenes to talk about right now.  Of these scenes, there is the all to disturbing liquidation of the ghetto.  The forced labour camp scenes as well were very disturbing.  They were mostly disturbing because of the head of the camps, Amon Goeth, a very ruthless and awful human being that just seems to shoot people for fun.  Just because.  And its disturbing to watch the disregard with which he does it.      Amon Goeth was played disturbingly by Ralph Fiennes, who should have won an Oscar, but thats neither here nor there.  He was some absolutley disturbing scenes that are just brilliantly played out.  I can point out a few, for instance a scene when he is talking with his Jewish servant(I will not tell you about what)and he does the whole conversation himself.  Watching him just change his tone, psychologically, in a matter of seconds is amazing.  Another I remember, is one when he is going to shoot a Jew in the back of the head, and his gun won't work.  Its just a terrifying scene in many ways, but Fiennes plays it in such a way that you can tell he has no morals or cares for Jews, but a blood lust.  Other than that though, his stare, his evil stare showed nothing but hatred, and I don't know how Fiennes did it, but it is a horribly evil stare.  His eyes said everything.  This was the highlight performance in the movie.    However, Liam Neeson and Ben Kingsley put together two great performances as well.  What is amazing between these two is watching their relationship change throughout the movie, until Neeson(as Schindler) is repentent and changed, and really sad he didn't do more, as he felt he could have.  Really, one of the most heart wrenching scenes in the film is when Schindler feels he could have done more and that he just didn't do enough.  In the film he goes from an opportunist to a true hero, an unselfish one.  The gift he gets from the Jews, and his embrace of Itzhak Stern(Kingsley)are truly wonderful and, apparently real moments.  Its hard not to be touched.    Not surprisingly however, the direction was absolutely brilliant.  Spielberg made a movie that was close to his heart and this was a labour of love, and it will stand as his masterpiece.  You can always tell you are watching the hand of a master, and I knew that when I started this film, Spielberg was going to give me something special, and he did.     The only mild flaw, most people seem to think, is the small portion of the film at the end that is in color.  It seems a little out of place, and that Spielberg added it on maybe for himself.  And I think he should be allowed to do so after the three hours before hand that were extremely emotional.  I didn't hate the very end like some people though, because to me it was a way to show us that this disaster, the Holocaust, happened only very recently, only fifty years ago(at the time this movie was released).  The fact is that some people who lived through this tragedy are still alive, and Spielberg, I feel, uses the end of the film to bridge that generation gap and remind us how recently this all happened.    So finally, all I can say is wow.  Not many movies has left me speechless.  This was one of the most emotional films I may have ever seen, remembering that I ended up crying a bit in three different places.  Usually I might cry once, but not three times.  It is subject matter that isn't taken lightly, and shouldn't.  Everything in its three hours are necessary and brilliant.  Everyone should see this movie once, if for nothing else than an education.  Just a brilliant film.  10 out of 10.

Being an ardent Pink Floyd fan all my life,  there are poignant bits of Waters' personal history discussed in relation to the semi-autobiographical film.

But it still has that Farrelly vibe, since J.B. Rogers worked as the A.D. in their previous works.  The movie gets off to a slow start.  The gags start off pretty lame.

Nine times out of ten, when you hear the announcer in a trailer say, from horror master Wes Craven or something of that sort, it means the well-known director is a producer or executive producer in the project, like in this case.  But it still has that Farrelly vibe, since J.B. Rogers worked as the A.D. in their previous works.  The movie gets off to a slow start.  The gags start off pretty lame.  And most of the funny parts shown were given away in the previews.  We're handed a lot of quirks, but the comedy doesn't quite gel.  We have Richard Jenkins as a wheelchair-bound father, who uses excessive profanity through a voice-box.  So far, we're pushing the envelope, but the laughs haven't entirely arrived.  I have to admit, though, the nipple-piercing scene was very funny.  Luckily, that scene wasn't completely given away in the trailers, because quite frankly--it couldn't be shown on network television.  The film speeds up the comedy with the arrival of Orlando Jones as a pilot with artificial legs and a Jimmi Hendrix hairdo.  For some reason, the Farrellys have an obsession with handicapped characters.  Jones is very funny, and brings in the film's biggest laughs.  I also think we wander into one-joke territory one time too many.  OK, the guy banged his sister.  It was funny at first.  How many times do we have to hear it repeated in the next gag...and the gag after that...and the gag after that?  But the gags improve as we go along, and I got more and more laughs.  By the last thirty minutes, I was laughing myself silly!  So I wouldn't say this comedy is anywhere near as bad as most people said it was.  Say It Isn't So isn't the best comedy of the year, but it often delivers.  And it's one of the few comedies that gets funnier as it goes along, rather than starting off with a bang and dragging on as it progresses.

The Mighty, by Peter Chesolm and starring Kieran Culkin and Elden Henson, was one of the best.Yet it follows a relatively common formula Max Kane (Henson) is a slow-witted giant of a boy who is frequently bullied at school. He lives with his grandparents (Gena Rowlands and Harry Dean Stanton) in a poor part of Cincinnati as his mother is dead and his father's in prison. He leads a stable yet unhappy life, picked on by Blade and the doghouse boys because he can't read. Then Kevin Dillon (Culkin) moves in next door. Kevin is immensely bright and has a loving mother (Sharon Stone in a rare low-key role), but he is crippled by Morquio's syndrome, a disease where his bones stop growing but his internal organs continue to do so.He is hired as Max's reading tutor and soon initiates a friendship. He introduces Max to reading and to the imaginary world of King Arthur and the Knights of the round table, effecively lending him his brain. In exchange, Max carries Kevin around on his shoulders, effectively becoming his legs. Together they roam the town as the knight Freak The Mighty, going on quests, doing good deeds and getting into trouble. Yet throughout their adventure, Kevin's disease and Max's recently paroled father loom over them like shadows.I won't tell anymore, but the end result is an extremely uplifting story about the value of friendship and the human ability to overcome hardship and sadness with the powers of love and caring. The Mighty is thus in the same league as The Cure, although it doesn't quite hold the latter's magic, maybe because it was made later.Yet it is in no way without qualities. The acting is impeccable. The supporting cast is fantastic, my favorites are Harry Dean Stanton as Grim and Gillian Anderson (not usually my favorite actress) as Loretta Lee, one of Kenny Kane's (Max's dad, played by James Gandolfini) old friends. Stanton has his usual charisma and Anderson's character is quirky and amusing. But the others are good as well. I mean, it's a stellar cast! But the real stars are, as is often the case in this kind of film, the kids. Elden Henson has the ever-important expressive face and gives a mesmerising performance. The end scene when he runs barefoot through the town is made spellbindingly emotional thanks to him. And Kieran Culkin is great as Kevin, he is smart and funny yet also encourages our sympathy and our emotion.Much better than Macauley! Together, Culkin and Henson rival Joseph Mazzello and Brad Renfro from The Cure in terms of acting talent. Yet one of The Mighty's problem lies with the actors, or more in their presentation. It has often been remarked that Miramax showed unbelievable incompetence when it came to the publicity and I would just like to add my own indignation to that of other viewers and of the cast (Culkin was annoyed that Miramax pushed back the release date, allowing Simon Birch to be released first). To advertise The Mighty as a Sharon Stone flick was a disaster. Too many studios undermine the young stars in favour of promoting the more famous supporting cast. It happened with Radio Flyer, yet The Mighty is ridiculous. Culkin and Henson's names appear after the movie's title in the opening credits! Anyway, ranting finished. Back to the positive stuff! Apart from the acting, the direction is good as well. Chelsom's camera is fluid and there are no goofs and the whole film is very pretty to look at. I would reproach a slight overdose of colour, it tends to detach the viewer from the reality of the picture, making it seem less real. But I suppose that it's to put an accent on the imagination side of things.The music is great as well. Trevor Jones' score has the right feel for the movie, with very medieval tunes and some very emotional melodies. It's up there with the scores of The Cure (Dave Grusin-fabulous) and Stand By Me (Jack Nitzsche-ditto). I also love the theme tune, 'Freak The Mighty', by Sting.All in all, this is a pure, unadulterated emotional movie. The characters are endearing, the music is touching and the story is at times humorous yet fundamentally designed to provoke thought and a few tears. Again, it's a film about friendship, which is a sacred value. It's up there with The Cure, stand By Me and The Straight Story. In fact, here's the list of my favorite emotional movies 1)Stand By Me 2)the Cure 3)=The Straight Story 3)=The Mighty 4)Central Station 5)Elephant Man 6)Simon Birch 7)Radio Flyer (I could've included the Spielberg greats, Empire of the Sun and Scindler's List, but they are part historical dramas. Also note that Central Station, Elephant and The Straight Story have more artistic value than the others, but that I'm just taking their emotional value into account.)Enough competition. The Mighty is a fantastic movie that all ages can enjoy. It is smart, funny, profound and infinitely touching. I recommend for anyone who enjoyed The Cure or Stand by Me. The acting is teriffic! 8\/10Uppers 1)The acting, especially  from Kieran Culkin and Elden Henson; 2)Chesolm's direction; 3)The music; 4)Sting's song; 5)The scene where Max runs through town at the end; 6)The dialogues and the humour; 7)The fireworks scene; 8)The very last scene with the book and the ornithopter; 9)It's incredibly emotional; 10)The scene where they walk high above the world; 11)Great chemistry between the two boys.Downers 1)Miramax's bungled publicity; 2)Why isn't it called Freak the Mighty like the book?; 3)Jingle Bells scene is a bit twee; 4)Maybe just a bit too much color.

He leads a stable yet unhappy life, picked on by Blade and the doghouse boys because he can't read. Then Kevin Dillon (Culkin) moves in next door. Kevin is immensely bright and has a loving mother (Sharon Stone in a rare low-key role), but he is crippled by Morquio's syndrome, a disease where his bones stop growing but his internal organs continue to do so.He is hired as Max's reading tutor and soon initiates a friendship. He introduces Max to reading and to the imaginary world of King Arthur and the Knights of the round table, effecively lending him his brain. In exchange, Max carries Kevin around on his shoulders, effectively becoming his legs. Together they roam the town as the knight Freak The Mighty, going on quests, doing good deeds and getting into trouble. Yet throughout their adventure, Kevin's disease and Max's recently paroled father loom over them like shadows.I won't tell anymore, but the end result is an extremely uplifting story about the value of friendship and the human ability to overcome hardship and sadness with the powers of love and caring. The Mighty is thus in the same league as The Cure, although it doesn't quite hold the latter's magic, maybe because it was made later.Yet it is in no way without qualities. The acting is impeccable. The supporting cast is fantastic, my favorites are Harry Dean Stanton as Grim and Gillian Anderson (not usually my favorite actress) as Loretta Lee, one of Kenny Kane's (Max's dad, played by James Gandolfini) old friends. Stanton has his usual charisma and Anderson's character is quirky and amusing. But the others are good as well. I mean, it's a stellar cast! But the real stars are, as is often the case in this kind of film, the kids. Elden Henson has the ever-important expressive face and gives a mesmerising performance. The end scene when he runs barefoot through the town is made spellbindingly emotional thanks to him. And Kieran Culkin is great as Kevin, he is smart and funny yet also encourages our sympathy and our emotion.Much better than Macauley! Together, Culkin and Henson rival Joseph Mazzello and Brad Renfro from The Cure in terms of acting talent. Yet one of The Mighty's problem lies with the actors, or more in their presentation. It has often been remarked that Miramax showed unbelievable incompetence when it came to the publicity and I would just like to add my own indignation to that of other viewers and of the cast (Culkin was annoyed that Miramax pushed back the release date, allowing Simon Birch to be released first). To advertise The Mighty as a Sharon Stone flick was a disaster. Too many studios undermine the young stars in favour of promoting the more famous supporting cast. It happened with Radio Flyer, yet The Mighty is ridiculous. Culkin and Henson's names appear after the movie's title in the opening credits! Anyway, ranting finished. Back to the positive stuff! Apart from the acting, the direction is good as well. Chelsom's camera is fluid and there are no goofs and the whole film is very pretty to look at. I would reproach a slight overdose of colour, it tends to detach the viewer from the reality of the picture, making it seem less real. But I suppose that it's to put an accent on the imagination side of things.The music is great as well. Trevor Jones' score has the right feel for the movie, with very medieval tunes and some very emotional melodies. It's up there with the scores of The Cure (Dave Grusin-fabulous) and Stand By Me (Jack Nitzsche-ditto). I also love the theme tune, 'Freak The Mighty', by Sting.All in all, this is a pure, unadulterated emotional movie. The characters are endearing, the music is touching and the story is at times humorous yet fundamentally designed to provoke thought and a few tears. Again, it's a film about friendship, which is a sacred value. It's up there with The Cure, stand By Me and The Straight Story. In fact, here's the list of my favorite emotional movies 1)Stand By Me 2)the Cure 3)=The Straight Story 3)=The Mighty 4)Central Station 5)Elephant Man 6)Simon Birch 7)Radio Flyer (I could've included the Spielberg greats, Empire of the Sun and Scindler's List, but they are part historical dramas. Also note that Central Station, Elephant and The Straight Story have more artistic value than the others, but that I'm just taking their emotional value into account.)Enough competition. The Mighty is a fantastic movie that all ages can enjoy. It is smart, funny, profound and infinitely touching. I recommend for anyone who enjoyed The Cure or Stand by Me. The acting is teriffic! 8\/10Uppers 1)The acting, especially  from Kieran Culkin and Elden Henson; 2)Chesolm's direction; 3)The music; 4)Sting's song; 5)The scene where Max runs through town at the end; 6)The dialogues and the humour; 7)The fireworks scene; 8)The very last scene with the book and the ornithopter; 9)It's incredibly emotional; 10)The scene where they walk high above the world; 11)Great chemistry between the two boys.Downers 1)Miramax's bungled publicity; 2)Why isn't it called Freak the Mighty like the book?; 3)Jingle Bells scene is a bit twee; 4)Maybe just a bit too much color.
