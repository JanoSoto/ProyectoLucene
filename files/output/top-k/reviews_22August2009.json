The Directing was good, as was the filming for the most part. The score was perfect for the movie. So kudos to Spielberg and John Williams. This is probably John Williams greatest soundtrack, (probably not Spielberg's greatest movie though). Those shots at the very end where The Shark is sinking the ship were especially good. The acting was also good. Richard Dreyfuss especially. It's not a film I would particularly want to watch again though.One viewing is enough to terrify one of the water, which does make Jaws serve its purpose. This might sound a bit nit picky, and I know this movie took place on the beach, though a lot of the scenes were just too bright. There was a glare in most of the beach scenes. The lighting was perfect in the scene they were trying to catch the shark with bait though. But that's not why I gave it a 6. The concept of Jaws has never really interested me; a giant shark that terrorizes swimmers.I found a couple of the scenes in Jaws to be overdone. Now I realize, these scenes were supposed to shock the viewer and add to the horror, though the movie would have been just as scary without them. I am not referring to the scene with the head popping out of the canoe, or whatever, that was well-done. The scenes I am referring to are the opening scenes; the first attack the shark makes, on the one girl swimming alone in the ocean. I thought it was one of the weakest scenes in the movie. It just went on for too long. To me, the scene could of been much better if the girl disappeared under the water, once the shark arrived. Instead we have to view her flailing and screaming for about 20 seconds. The producers did make this scene more frightening by not showing the shark in this particular scene.Another one was the scene towards the end when the shark swam onto the ship and tore that fishermen to shreds. I mean, come on was it really necessary to show the shark biting him that many times?, with streams of blood spewing out of him? I think a little editing would have been very good for Jaws, as it is a PG movie. How it was rated that, is beyond me. PG does suggest parental guidance, though only moderately. I think the parental guidance that would surround the viewing of Jaws, for children, should be much more than moderate.I also like for a horror movie to hide some of the violence, a lot of times it makes the movie more suspenseful. Jaws actually does do this in some scenes. For example, between all of the attacks, the shark is only shown a few times in the movie. So when the shark actually does appear, its all the more terrifying. These were the only scenes that bothered me though, everything else was well-done. I agree that Movies like this are classics (despite my six)and worth watching during some point of a persons life. Probably after they left all their beach years behind, as I saw this movie months ago, and have not swam in the ocean since. I was already scared enough of the ocean as it was, but Jaws just brought it too a whole new level.

I've waited a while to see it, because the description of it didn't quite interest me. So when I decided to to finally watch it....I was absolutely blown away! I've never seen anything quite like it. I had never heard of Orson Welles, let alone seen a picture by him. Since then there are a few films that has captivated me like this one, like The Trial. Even Citizen Kane hadn't that impact on me, but that was because I didn't understand it at first. Touch of evil ranked as my number one movie of all time for years to come.So, what is it than that makes this movie the way it is? First of all, the absolutely stunning photography how everything shines (note the glimmering cars), the lightning of faces, walls with indicative advertising). It's simply the most beautifully shot film ever, period! Secondly, the use of sound. In the famous opening shot you can hear the bomb ticking and while the car with the bomb is driving away, you can hear all the different noises and music coming from different corners of the street. Also the overlapping dialogue add to the realism of the film. When I first saw the movie, it was the version with the Mancini score. It is quite catchy and very appropriate for the movie, but I think I'd prefer the restored version (the opening anyway) because of Welles' use of sound. It's magnificent. Third, the camera-work (dollyshots and the extreme and creative angles). Technically, it's a very complex film. Next to the opening scene you have the interrogation scene in Sanchez' apartment, which is one long take! Some say Welles is just showing of, but they can't be more wrong. Both long takes serve distinctive purposes the long take of the opening scene greatly enhances the tension of the ticking bomb (when there were cuts in this scene, the audience would loose track of time and couldn't follow the three minutes to which the bomb is set to explode)and the long take in the apartment also greatly enhances the tension between Vargas and Quinlan (it is a crucial scene in the movie we get to know the faul tactics and the style of intimidation of Quinlan and the righteousness of Vargas, which, by the way, gets under heavy pressure towards the end of the movie).What is it about? The basic story line is fairly simple good cop meets bad cop and brings him down. The story is based upon the pulp novel Badge of evil by Whit Masterson. According to Welles himself, he didn't even read the novel but got immediately to work on rewriting the original screenplay he got from the studio. To be honest, this movie isn't about a revolving plot, but about rounding out characters, especially Captain Quinlan, played by Welles himself. He's got a touch of evil' ever since he let the murderer (a Mexican) of his wife go free, because of lack of evidence. We can understand the motives of Quinlan, but ultimately we don't approve of his methods, although he is usually (in this case anyway) right about the suspect. The fact that Vargas gets the evidence of Quinlan's corruption so easily (although he still has to get the evidence of the framing of Sanchez)is't very believable, but it still is possible. Orson Welles wrote a story about character, about good and evil and the ambiguity of it and above all...about prejudices and racism (Leigh's character's hidden racism Lead on, Poncho!).There is much criticism of the acting of Charlton Heston. I'm not a big fan of his acting, but I do think he certainly does a fine job here. He embodies the righteousness and stubbornness of the character beautifully. Yes, it isn't a great actor, but this is his best work by far. Janet leigh does a good job. She doesn't have much to work with, but she does it well. Orson as Quinlan steels the show. But I'd like to mention two other actors which are rarely mentioned in reviews of this film. Akim Tamiroff does a great job as the gangster boss Uncle Grandi. He is frightening and funny at the same time. But the most praise must go to Joseph Calleia, who, in my opinion does steel the show as a mislead friend of Quinlan. He is the most dramatic figure in the movie and plays it brilliantly.Finally, I'd like to point out, that this is not a film noir, despite of many, many references to it. I admit it has noir elements to it, but it lacks the most important ones a hasn't got a weak protagonist, who is pudding in the, also missing here, femme fatale's hands. So, for the lack of these defining film noir ingredients, we'd better call it a German expressionistic film! But that doesn't do it also, because everything about the mise-en-scene in German expressionistic films relate to the inner beings of the characters, and in Touch of evil we don't see a mise-en-scene strictly build up of straight lines. I guess the best term to define Touch of evil is 'policefilm,' 'copfilm,' or perhaps a detective drama.Touch of evil is all about atmosphere and mood I've read a commentator write on this site. That's absolutely true. THis movie has to be seen to be believed at points it is surreal, sometimes it's a bit comical, sometimes it is horrific and most of the time it's just plain beautiful. You have to see this film if you love the movies. It ranks among Citizen Kane and The Magnificent Ambersons as one of the most beautiful pictures ever made. That is...only if you really love the movies!

The basic story line is fairly simple good cop meets bad cop and brings him down. The story is based upon the pulp novel Badge of evil by Whit Masterson. According to Welles himself, he didn't even read the novel but got immediately to work on rewriting the original screenplay he got from the studio. To be honest, this movie isn't about a revolving plot, but about rounding out characters, especially Captain Quinlan, played by Welles himself. He's got a touch of evil' ever since he let the murderer (a Mexican) of his wife go free, because of lack of evidence. We can understand the motives of Quinlan, but ultimately we don't approve of his methods, although he is usually (in this case anyway) right about the suspect. The fact that Vargas gets the evidence of Quinlan's corruption so easily (although he still has to get the evidence of the framing of Sanchez)is't very believable, but it still is possible. Orson Welles wrote a story about character, about good and evil and the ambiguity of it and above all...about prejudices and racism (Leigh's character's hidden racism Lead on, Poncho!).There is much criticism of the acting of Charlton Heston. I'm not a big fan of his acting, but I do think he certainly does a fine job here. He embodies the righteousness and stubbornness of the character beautifully. Yes, it isn't a great actor, but this is his best work by far. Janet leigh does a good job. She doesn't have much to work with, but she does it well. Orson as Quinlan steels the show. But I'd like to mention two other actors which are rarely mentioned in reviews of this film. Akim Tamiroff does a great job as the gangster boss Uncle Grandi. He is frightening and funny at the same time. But the most praise must go to Joseph Calleia, who, in my opinion does steel the show as a mislead friend of Quinlan. He is the most dramatic figure in the movie and plays it brilliantly.Finally, I'd like to point out, that this is not a film noir, despite of many, many references to it. I admit it has noir elements to it, but it lacks the most important ones a hasn't got a weak protagonist, who is pudding in the, also missing here, femme fatale's hands. So, for the lack of these defining film noir ingredients, we'd better call it a German expressionistic film! But that doesn't do it also, because everything about the mise-en-scene in German expressionistic films relate to the inner beings of the characters, and in Touch of evil we don't see a mise-en-scene strictly build up of straight lines.

I've waited a while to see it, because the description of it didn't quite interest me. So when I decided to to finally watch it....I was absolutely blown away! I've never seen anything quite like it. I had never heard of Orson Welles, let alone seen a picture by him. Since then there are a few films that has captivated me like this one, like The Trial. Even Citizen Kane hadn't that impact on me, but that was because I didn't understand it at first. Touch of evil ranked as my number one movie of all time for years to come.So, what is it than that makes this movie the way it is? First of all, the absolutely stunning photography how everything shines (note the glimmering cars), the lightning of faces, walls with indicative advertising). It's simply the most beautifully shot film ever, period! Secondly, the use of sound. In the famous opening shot you can hear the bomb ticking and while the car with the bomb is driving away, you can hear all the different noises and music coming from different corners of the street. Also the overlapping dialogue add to the realism of the film. When I first saw the movie, it was the version with the Mancini score. It is quite catchy and very appropriate for the movie, but I think I'd prefer the restored version (the opening anyway) because of Welles' use of sound. It's magnificent. Third, the camera-work (dollyshots and the extreme and creative angles). Technically, it's a very complex film.

I expected to hate it but I loved it, and my husband and I sat spellbound from start to finish. The film is sometimes a dream, then it is reality, then just a dream, it totally messes with your head. Makes you think. Makes you feel.Definitely, without a doubt, Cruise's best dramatic performance. Fantastic. He starts the film as a playboy, all full of himself, charming. Then he transforms into a bitter, tortured man. Unsettling to see, whether behind the mask or with his disfigurement showing. I felt his anguish.And Penelope Cruz, long before her brazen performance in Vicky Cristina Barcelona, making us fall for her. Beautiful, heartfelt. And Cameron Diaz is convincing as the messed-up stalker girlfriend you don't quite expect to see. Earl (Jason Lee) is also good as Cruise's only friend.

But I have to say, I just didn't get it! The movie is like some kind of surreal satire on the city of Nashville, and the state of America in the 1970's. It's Nashville...but it's like an alternate universe Nashville where the people talk endlessly, on and on, about nothing! It's like Seinfeld without the jokes or character development.This Nashville is filled with people who are completely clueless about how superficial their lives are, who seem to have no idea how stupid they are. A key scene early on involves a multi-car pile-up on the interstate. But instead of running around from car to car asking Is everyone all right? Is anyone hurt?, the people in the pile-up (who are all, by strange coincidence, characters in the movie) seem more annoyed that this accident will make them late for dinner, or to whatever they have to go to. They talk with each other, exchange phone numbers, buy and sell goods, eat popsicles bought from an ice cream. Nobody seems phased that they've just been through a massive near-death experience. These are not people, they are characters in a social commentary. Altman's take on the country music industry is very strange. In this version of Nashville, there are a lot of country music singers who can't sing! I don't just mean the wannabe singers like Suleen Gay (Gwen Welles) who is too stupid to realize she doesn't have any talent. I mean established country stars like Tommy Brown (Timmy Brown), Haven Hamilton (Henry Gibson), and Connie White (Karen Black), who are singing onstage at the Grand Ole Opry, but who have limited pitch ranges, and slide their notes up and down the scale as they sing. These country stars wouldn't last 30 seconds at an American Idol audition. Simon Cowell would eat them alive and spit them out! Most of the songs in the movie seem to be country song pastiches. (One song includes the lyrics, The pilot light of our love has gone out and If makin' love is margarine, then you're a slippery spread.) Only occasionally do we get a sincere, well-sung country song, like Keith Carradine's I'm Easy. Ronnie Blakely has a good role as a Loretta Lynn-style country singer who has an onstage meltdown at Opryland. But even her onstage meltdown seems phony -- it is a caricature of an onstage meltdown written by a Hollywood screenwriter. (Did she really need to make chicken sounds onstage to make the point that she was cracking up?) The city of Nashville seems to have gone insane, but nobody seems to notice. A sound truck drives around, blaring political arguments for a populist presidential candidate. A man (Jeff Goldblum) rides around on a three-wheel motorcycle, stopping occasionally to do magic tricks. An annoying British journalist (Geraldine Chapman) keeps showing up at parties and bars and sticking her microphone in people's faces, asking them questions and ignoring their answers.And of course, people talk, non-stop, about nothing in particular, in Altman's trademark overlapping dialogue, for two hours and forty minutes. This form of movie dialogue may be considered realistic, but in this case, I found it very boring.Yes, I know, Altman was making a comment on the times, and the 1970's were a very surreal and superficial time. But the fact that Altman captured the surreal, superficial qualities of the 70's doesn't necessarily mean it's an interesting movie. I found the characters dull, the dialogue boring, and the plot fairly nonsensical. If I ever pass through this Nashville, remind me to stay on the bus to Memphis.

Playing very fast and loose with the facts of the real Ness\/Capone story this is definitely a Hollywood version of the Prohibition saga. Honestly there seems to be very little based in fact here other than that there once indeed lived men named Eliot Ness and Al Capone. So the movie isn't going to work as a history lesson. Does it work simply as a movie? Not as well as one might hope. The movie holds your attention throughout, the story is certainly compelling. But there are definitely problems littered throughout the film. You get the sense all the film's pieces never quite come together as well as they should.One of the movie's biggest problems is right at its heart. Kevin Costner's portrayal of Ness always seems a bit off. The character comes across as very bland, Costner seems to often be scared to show even a hint of emotion. He's rather boring and that's certainly not good. Meanwhile in portraying Capone we have Robert De Niro who appears to be acting in an entirely different movie than everybody else. With the film focusing mostly on Ness and his lawmen the Capone sequences often seem forced and oddly out of place. And, aside from one instance where he provides a novel use for a baseball bat, we never really see Capone's ruthless streak. In fact De Niro's Capone at times seems almost charming, likable even. Something about that doesn't seem right. Undoubtedly the best performance in the film comes from Sean Connery playing an Irish beat cop who, in the real history, never actually existed. Connery gets the lion's share of the memorable lines and certainly does well with the role.Director Brian De Palma, as is his wont, goes for the memorable visuals and the look at me, aren't I brilliant directorial touches. The famous baby on the staircase sequence? If it wasn't an homage you'd call it downright silly. Actually even as an homage it's still rather silly. And almost interminable. Unfortunately De Palma seems far too often to be more interested in filming things in a unique fashion than in making sure his story works. And sometimes the story simply isn't working. The movie is often too Hollywood for its own good. There are some things which you see up on the screen which simply aren't believable, having that only in the movies feel which takes you out of the film entirely. Most notable is when one character has perhaps the longest death sequence in film history. You can't help but find yourself saying shouldn't you be quite dead by now? Matters often aren't helped by the widely praised musical score which in actuality is at times rather intrusive and jarring. What we're left with is a movie which works in bits and pieces but which doesn't quite add up.

Some people, like myself, were fans of the original Star Trek show, but not particularly enthusiastic about the television show, The Next Generation, feeling that a Shakespearian actor for the Captain of a starship was bombastic and opposed to the show having a sense of free wheeling adventure, something that existed in the original show. As such I think that only the Star Trek films that include the original cast are worth watching more than once. I met few people who liked the first Star Trek motion picture, I put that down to people just not comprehending it. Who knows what the future may bring?

Some people, like myself, were fans of the original Star Trek show, but not particularly enthusiastic about the television show, The Next Generation, feeling that a Shakespearian actor for the Captain of a starship was bombastic and opposed to the show having a sense of free wheeling adventure, something that existed in the original show. As such I think that only the Star Trek films that include the original cast are worth watching more than once. I met few people who liked the first Star Trek motion picture, I put that down to people just not comprehending it. Who knows what the future may bring?

The plot is intelligent and the acting is perfect and it maintains continuity with the original show. I think the visuals in this film are so intricate in terms of a certain interstellar object, the mind does not register its full complexity the first time around.

Even though Hayley Mills was Walt Disney's number one star at the time, Chevalier's international status as a performer guaranteed him top billing. The younger cast members had a lot to do in keeping up with him.Robert Gwillim who is a sea captain and father to Hayley Mills and Keith Hamshere has been lost at sea for many years now and who knows where in this wide world with 5\/6 of it covered by ocean. But a swallowed bottle with a note that was found in the belly of a shark by scientist Maurice Chevalier sends the three of them in search of Gwillim's employer Wilfrid Hyde-White to finance an expedition to search. Said note leads them first to South America and then to Australia because Maurice misreads the clues. He did that a lot in this film, an occupational hazard with eccentric scientists. This was the Magic Kingdom's second dealing with a Jules Verne story, the first being the classic 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea. Sad to say while In Search Of The Castaways has some interesting moments and in spots looks more like an Indiana Jones film, it does not make it above the juvenile level. Watching it today, I expected to see Harrison Ford ride in with bullwhip cracking to save the whole kit and kaboodle of them from villain George Sanders.Maurice's first mistake took them 10,000 miles out of their way. It's not often one gets a second chance there.

","genre":"Adventure, Family, Fantasy"},{"date":"22 August 2009","score":"","review":" I give this one an eight because I think some good creative thought went into its making. It is not an overly heavy handed movie-the characterizations are realistic and the aliens are believable and interesting. I was impressed by the idea of a group of aliens attempting to blend themselves into human society in this film, with some fairly hilarious results. Many film makers have dealt with the same subject matter and not done it so effectively. I did see the television show it had as a spin off, but I didn't think the television show was all that good. Using James Caan to play a hard nosed detective was a good idea, and I think the film is probably better off for it.I have heard people criticize using him in the film. I think that is the whole point of it, the contrast between the human and the alien personality. The opening scene in the film is great. A treat for SF fans, at least, it was for me. I think newer film makers tend to shy away from trying to make originals like this movie, perhaps going for something that avoids the whole concept of alien societies. I wonder why. Maybe it is just too much work for most of them. Films like this are few and far between.

Anyway the big Swede don't take too kindly to anyone pushing him around and he soon runs afoul of the local bad guys who want his land.The movie isn't too bad nor too good.It just sort of plods it's way along to the predictable conclusion although I will give it points for being at least a little bit original in the final showdown.You'll see a few familiar faces besides Hayden and Cabot...some of those faces you'll remember from TV shows like The Andy Griffin Show and Green Acres.This movie was OK .I gave it a 5.But honestly if I catch it on AMC again I'd probably flip on by it.It's good enough to see once but not nearly good enough to sit through twice.
