This film is an original concept in that it explores this angle and leading towards World War III in a highly realistic manner similar to the Tom Clancy books, giving us a peek into the workings of true government. This is not a James Bond style silliness where racing boats and magnetic wristwatches win the day.There's humor, good acting, the dialogue is great... the fascists are a little silly but they don't appear in the film much. Please note, immediately after 9-11 when this film came out, it was seen as divisive and possibly too painful to have Middle Eastern terrorists in a film. That's why they put in fascists instead.In short I think they do a lot with a little, using real drama to move the plot forward and not needing everyone to swing from vines and ski off of cliffs constantly.I also think that, at the time this movie came out, a lot of people were fed up with Ben Affleck and his tabloid persona. Since then, Ben has matured and produced top films such as Gone Baby Gone. I hope we can leave Ben-hatred to the past.Finally, a lot of people who read Tom Clancy's book -- as I have -- seemed to feel that any film that didn't stick perfectly to the plot must be awful. It's a black or white world for them. I disagree. Re-starting the Ryan franchise (like Batman Begins or Casino Royale, which restarted the Batman and James Bond franchises) was a good idea, in my opinion, and the script neatly places the new Ryan in the center of all the action without requiring goofy coincidences.This film is the story of a possible World War III, done perhaps in the most realistic possible way that can be dramatized.

I'll keep you posted.Anyway, I am of the opinion that there is a fine line between building suspense and boring the living crap out of me. Sometimes a movie can be boring but still entertain with cinematography, like BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN.

It's just, 85% of this movie was just filler drudge I didn't need to see. Like people driving, parking, getting out of the car and walking to the next scene. Was there an editor shortage in 1963? That's not suspense, that's tedium.And you know, I'm fine with the fact that there's never an explanation offered for why the birds go nuts, that was okay.

I mean, come on. They're BIRDS. Just swat 'em down and step on 'em. They've got hollow bones and weigh less than a pound.And when the main character thinks she hears birds in the house, after everything that's just happened, and goes off on her own to investigate, and then finds a room that sounds like there's birds in it, so she manages to shut herself inside and then get attacked by birds... Frankly, she deserved to die. Though I really don't buy that you can be pecked to death instantly by birds.And how do we make our harrowing escape? Uh, the birds that just tried pretty darn hard to kill everyone are gonna just sit and watch while the movie's hero spends twenty minutes pulling the car up and walking everyone out the front door in slow motion, and then we'll just drive away. The end.Wait, what? I will say one thing for THE BIRDS, it has the absolutely most GIGANTIC telephones I've ever seen on film. And they paid for the phones, so darn it, they were gonna use 'em. This movie would've been shortened by 35-40 minutes if you eliminated the pointless phone conversations. It would've been over an hour shorter if touch-tone phones had replaced rotary dials by then.So anyway, yeah, THE BIRDS. Incredibly retarded movie.

When the shooter wounds one of the Americans, they kill him in self-defense. It's probably not the smartest move, seeing as how insanely the Norwegians were trying to kill it, but the Americans take the dog in. Little do they know it's not a dog at all, but an alien life form mimicking a dog. Soon it reveals its true form &#150; kind of &#150; and is burned to death. Unfortunately, it's a crafty organism and has likely infected one or more of the men. But how could you know? It's a perfect mimic, pretty much undetectable until it's too late. The film features some of the best special effects of its time &#150; they have not dated a bit, and are every bit as creepy and nasty as they were in 1982. The monster, when it reveals itself, is a true Lovecraftian thing that takes on all kinds of forms, probably an amalgam of the different organisms it has mimicked over its lifetime. Put the monster aside, though, and there's this great, intense study of paranoia. Nobody trusts anybody as star Kurt Russell puts it. Reminiscent of perhaps The Big Sleep, if you closely scrutinize the series of events, the plot makes no sense. There's no conceivable way the persons who eventually end up as the thing could have become it. But this lack of logic itself is part of why the movie is so horrifying. You never can tell who is or who is not an alien. Carpenter wisely never lets the audience see anything. Kudos to him for that. And also kudos to him for including two black characters who don't die in the first ten minutes of the movie, an almost unheard of feat for an African American person in a 1980s (or '90s or even '00s) horror movie!

He sure did. I would even say it is a posthumous autobiography in prospective expectation. It is an American film about America and the Americans. The grandiose grandeur of those who are dreaming America into being and the petty narrow-mindedness of those who are only defending their own interests. Which tribe is most important? No one can know. The dreamers get isolated and lonely, at times in the golden heart of wealth and money. The self-centered ones just cut the cake and are very careful to give a very thin slice to others and an enormous slice to themselves. Then they all die sooner or later and only the dreamers survive. The others disappear in the darkness of hell, the underworld of forgotten anti-history. But this film reveals, and at the time it was probably scandalous, the power of the press as for building public opinion and the absurdity of the Americans as for forbidding politicians to have a normal private life, I mean the right to have a private life of their own and only their own. The tragic dimension of this character is that he is trapped by the very first, the power of the press he had used tremendously and had even boosted up in incredible proportions, with his very private life. Then the rest is only vanity and vain pretence he tried to prove what he did not have to prove and he used other people to do so, particularly his second wife, which led to the end of the dream that had turned into a nightmare with a brain stroke and death. One can only prove what is really real and not what is virtually eventually maybe possible. Then of course we have to admire the technique of this film and the marvelous black and white finish and gloss. We also have to point out the film is renewing the genre of the biography of a great man by creating some mystery around one word, rosebud, which probably has no value at all and is there to make us look at the pictures and images with a more attentive eye, as if we were supposed to be private eyed sleuths.

Like his directorial debut, Say Anything, Singles brings us great music, a cast of unknowns we all know now, and a story with heart and laughs. Maybe it just goes to where I am in my life at the moment, but this movie really resonated with me. The fact that life relies so much on luck, whether good or bad, to shape our personal relationships, our career, and our loves is quite prevalent. Sometimes it takes an accident, an event that you were never looking for, to bring two people together, or rekindle something that was thought to be lost forever. If only I lived in Seattle right now and it was the early-90s, I wouldn't mind going through it all as much as in Buffalo. At least I could go to a club show and see acts like Pearl Jam, Alice in Chains, Soundgarden, and Citizen Dick. Now that was a music scene.Singles is about just that, a group of twenty-somethings going through that transition after college, beginning careers and looking for meaningful relationships. Most of the characters live in a small apartment complex and are very close friends, (I guess you can look past the fact that the entire five person building consists of that one age group). There is the rocker working four jobs and not able to see the perfect girl standing right in front of him (Matt Dillon); the girl who is working off her loans to go back to school and make something of her life (Bridget Fonda); the guy who has found success in work but not in life finally running into the girl of his dreams in the one place he never thought he'd find her (Campbell Scott); and that girl, tired of the games and heartbreak, trying to open herself up to him, someone she cares for, but is too afraid to risk losing everything again (Kyra Sedgwick). Each of these actors is fantastic and adds just the right amount of quirk and individuality to the film. We all know people like these and I know I started to superimpose myself with my friends into the story because it has or could happen to us. Sure it is a different decade and yes the film is dated in that way (garage openers as the new varsity letter jacket?) but at its core, this could be any year.I also really like the direction by Crowe. He is a writer and rock music fanatic by trade and attempts to infuse a lot of his own sensibilities to the work. There is a novice quality still at play and it just makes everything that much more believable and tenuous. Without the gloss and polish you feel as though it all is transpiring right before your eyes. Even his use of breaking the fourth wall, for no apparent reason whatsoever, worked for me. Splitting the film into vignettes is a nice touch too, but it is the narration straight to the camera that intrigues. I would love to say a show like Saved By the Bell owes much to this film, but sadly it predates it. So, maybe Crowe appropriated the gimmick himself, either way it works as a way of seeing inside the leads and flesh them out a bit more. The payoff of Scott yelling out the window for Dillon to be quiet as he was talking is great. He's talking to us as an aside fictionally, but I guess the guy needs his concentration. I even liked the spotting blatant material objects for each character, especially books. One is by Lester Bangs, (a future role infused in Crowe's Almost Famous); Sedgwick, of course, has Franny & Zooey (a superior novel in my opinion to Catcher in the Rye as she is looking for her Holden Caufield); and Fonda has Ayn Rand's The Fountainhead, as should every aspiring architect.And the cameos&#151;how can I not mention the plethora of bit parts, all priceless in their own way?

Having much success with cult films, I decided to take a gamble and purchase it. I'm very glad that I did so. Donnie Darko is a monumental film in its intertwining of fantasy and time travel science. The film addresses existentialism and free will as part of the human condition.The film combines a stereotypical high school (enhanced by the unimpressive Drew Berrymore) with an emotionally troubled young man. The film opens with an airplane part crashing into Donnie's home. Donnie doesn't die in the crash because he is called out of home by a mysterious rabbit. He then experiences visions from the ghostly rabbit that represents the other choice that some god could have chosen for him or that he otherwise avoided. The apparition tells him the world will end at a set time. I believe this occurs because Donnie's continued life altered the course of time. Donnie unintentionally discovers how this will happen, but it isn't obvious to either the audience or to Donnie himself. The rabbit's haunting allows Donnie to know the truth behind actions and intentions. He discovers a child pornographer's secret and realizes why Smurfit exists. Donnie is also able to see future where people will walk before they do. While this may sound trite, I assure you that it isn't. He doesn't see visions, just a celestial, amorphous figure that appears in front of the person. These images are CGI-enhanced, which is surprising for a cult film. Finally, a wormhole opens over his home and the airplane part from earlier falls on Donnie's home which kills him. This is what would have happened if the rabbit hadn't removed him from the home. I'm no theologian, but this film seemingly supports the theory that the divine has a set plan for all of us. Why then would Donnie have survived when the plane originally crashed? I have no religious views of my own, but it would appear as if Kelly may have had included his as director of this film.Jake Gyllenhall does a spectacular job as Donnie. He always has stooped shoulders as one would imagine an emotionally troubled, Casi-depressed person would. His speech appears schizophrenic and conspicuous.

Having much success with cult films, I decided to take a gamble and purchase it. I'm very glad that I did so. Donnie Darko is a monumental film in its intertwining of fantasy and time travel science. The film addresses existentialism and free will as part of the human condition.The film combines a stereotypical high school (enhanced by the unimpressive Drew Berrymore) with an emotionally troubled young man. The film opens with an airplane part crashing into Donnie's home. Donnie doesn't die in the crash because he is called out of home by a mysterious rabbit. He then experiences visions from the ghostly rabbit that represents the other choice that some god could have chosen for him or that he otherwise avoided. The apparition tells him the world will end at a set time. I believe this occurs because Donnie's continued life altered the course of time. Donnie unintentionally discovers how this will happen, but it isn't obvious to either the audience or to Donnie himself. The rabbit's haunting allows Donnie to know the truth behind actions and intentions. He discovers a child pornographer's secret and realizes why Smurfit exists. Donnie is also able to see future where people will walk before they do. While this may sound trite, I assure you that it isn't. He doesn't see visions, just a celestial, amorphous figure that appears in front of the person. These images are CGI-enhanced, which is surprising for a cult film. Finally, a wormhole opens over his home and the airplane part from earlier falls on Donnie's home which kills him. This is what would have happened if the rabbit hadn't removed him from the home. I'm no theologian, but this film seemingly supports the theory that the divine has a set plan for all of us. Why then would Donnie have survived when the plane originally crashed? I have no religious views of my own, but it would appear as if Kelly may have had included his as director of this film.Jake Gyllenhall does a spectacular job as Donnie.

More importantly, Glory is a very important movie.I'm a History aficionado, but I knew nothing about the story of the first all-African American regiment of Civil War soldiers &#150; a 600-person regiment led by a handful of white officers. More movies like this should be made because they can, frankly, help make the American people smarter about history and spur them to learn more.It's true that the individual African-American soldiers in Glory are fictional people in the middle of the portrayal of actual events, but the 54th Massachusetts Volunteer Regiment was real. If I find out that the writers had in-depth information on actual soldiers, I'll be disappointed. In the meantime, I'll praise the history lessons imparted by the movie.Glory does an excellent job portraying the different kinds of whites and blacks who lived in the Civil War era &#150; abolitionists, anti-black Union soldiers, corrupt Union officers, educated free blacks, uneducated blacks, and blacks who were understandably angry and rebellious after years of slavery and other moral outrages.Although the individuals portrayed are fictional, their character types can be used in a classroom to teach Civil War history. Glory is not exactly JFK &#150; an abomination that has dishonestly taught ignorant young Americans lies about history.Glory, though, would be a great movie even if it wasn't a valuable history lesson. The movie is a storytelling masterpiece. It does a splendid job of introducing the main characters and focuses on just the right amount of people &#150; four black soldiers and three white officers. All these characters are strongly developed, and the writing lures viewers into following their progress.The strong characters set up a long list of interesting character conflicts that dominate the movie and kept me riveted. My list includes the regiment's white abolitionist commander vs. his deputy\/lifelong friend, the commander vs. a white officer who harshly disciplines blacks, the commander vs. an educated black man he knew in Boston, an angry black man vs. the educated black man, and the angry black vs. the leader of the blacks portrayed by Morgan Freeman.Each of these conflicts is bolstered by well-written dialogue that often includes dramatic and intriguing confrontations.There are also at least three supporting characters in the Union Army that the lead character, Col. Robert Gould Shaw (played by Matthew Broderick), has conflicts with as he fights for the rights of his African-American troops to have adequate equipment and fight the Confederates.In addition, there are group conflicts that fit seamlessly into the plot &#150; white officers trying to train black soldiers, blacks fighting to be treated as equals, white bigots vs. white non-bigots, Union soldiers and officers persevering despite Confederate threats to execute them for race mixing, and the North vs. the South.Actual letters written by the real Shaw are used as voice-overs. They give an insight into a man who is empathetic to blacks, has hopes and fears about the Civil War and his regiment, and makes observations about his soldiers' off-the-field culture and camaraderie. His letters make his behavior even more interesting as he evolves into a commander who is often tough toward his trainees.Although Col. Shaw becomes strong and principled, the evolution of the educated (Thomas) and angry black (played by Denzel Washington) men are even more interesting. Thomas evolves from a privileged man who is a terrible soldier into a profile in courage who overcomes gun wounds to save the life of his personal enemy, Washington, and becomes an outstanding warrior.Washington is in one great scene after another as he evolves from a selfish, angry man who initiates fights into a war hero who learns how to channel his excessive energy. I generally don't comment on acting, but Washington is spectacular. He earned his Best Supporting Actor award!! I felt like I was watching his character, not him, particularly as he maintained his composure while staring at Col. Shaw as he gets whipped in one of the five best movie scenes I've ever seen.Washington's intensity in the whipping scene and others (fighting for equal pay, challenging racist white soldiers, lecturing Thomas) leaps off the screen. Sean Penn is a very good actor, but I'm consciously aware it's him when I watch him, and I get the impression he's calibrating how intense he can be without losing his credibility.Glory was even better when I watched it for a second time.

Don't let the fact its about Nazis put you off - Peckinpah makes his characters truly universal and often sympathetic, despite never once depicting their actions in a positive light. It ain't subtle, but like many other great political films, it doesn't need to be. The lack of subtlety makes it a more powerful picture in the end.Peckinpah's direction is terrific as usual. He has all the same trademarks (slow motion violence, intense dialog), but they never seem to get old. Its quickly paced like most of his good films, making the disturbing content rather entertaining. The acting is uneven, but the four stars are all fantastic. James Coburn, a very underrated performer, gives possibly his greatest performance. Unlike the Flint films of the late 60s, he doesn't attempt to look cool and instead concentrates on the nuances of his complex role.

The Wild Bunch is rightly regarded as being a classic, Straw Dogs is still mired in controversy, and Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia is finally getting the critical reevaluation it's deserved after all these years. However, this, Sam Peckinpah's last great film, is almost completely forgotten. Thats a shame, because its a nearly perfect anti-war film, one that effectively examines the deadening effects the battlefield can wield on a man's soul. Don't let the fact its about Nazis put you off - Peckinpah makes his characters truly universal and often sympathetic, despite never once depicting their actions in a positive light. It ain't subtle, but like many other great political films, it doesn't need to be. The lack of subtlety makes it a more powerful picture in the end.Peckinpah's direction is terrific as usual. He has all the same trademarks (slow motion violence, intense dialog), but they never seem to get old. Its quickly paced like most of his good films, making the disturbing content rather entertaining. The acting is uneven, but the four stars are all fantastic. James Coburn, a very underrated performer, gives possibly his greatest performance.

I guess it was good for them stretching it, but as an all in all movie it's really sucks. George C Scott delivered a brilliant performance like always, but the all around story sucked, pretty much forgetting the first two movies and just taking the surviving characters and throwing them in a whirlwind of religious crap and cheeky slasher ideas. The book Legion was far better and just wish William Peter Blatty could've done a better job with the third installment. Two thumbs way down. I think there was one mention of the previous movies and in where does any of it fall the battle between Legion and Father Morning. It was all completely missed and they just added it for time filler. I think the only redeemable part of this movie was the return of Jason Miller as Damien Karris, however how was it missed that his body was never laid to rest, or the fact that he remained under the care of a hospital wing for oh so long?? And what of the fact that the demon has a personal grudge with the surviving cast members of The Exorcist. Instead of going after the little girl and her mother who managed to stop it in it's tracks, it just decides to weed through everyone else in Georgetown. It just left too many questions for it being a third installment. The first is brilliant and I know it's suicide for a sequel to compare it to the original, but damn you can only go so far before it's impossible to compare a little. The darkness and morbid settings of the first one were brilliantly constructed, whereas this one they just filled a cheap rip off of The Zodiac Murders, and slapped Exorcist III in the title.

But the black and white makes it extra eerie. Also, the music and dark tone of the movie makes you on the edge of your seat. There are lots of small things that make the mood. Like Marion's lingerie is white in one scene but black during a much more eerie scene. The storyline is fairly simple but in 1960 was very original. Nowadays, every wannabe movie has the same idea but this is the movie it all originated from. The kills are very VERY memorable. Particularly the first one. Even 50 years later they are remembered. I must say, this movie shocked me more than many other much more recent horror films, not to say none others scared me but I will go so far as to say Psycho is scarier than much of the crap we see nowadays, like The Ring or The Grudge.I recommend this film to...everyone. You cannot call yourself a movie lover if you do not see Psycho! Watch the original, not the crappy 90's version! This movie deserves a 10\/10. ","genre":"Horror, Mystery, Thriller"}]
