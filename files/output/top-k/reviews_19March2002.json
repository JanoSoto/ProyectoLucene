Do not see this movie if you are feeling emotional and do not see this movie without tissues. That said, this is a wonderful movie, filled with the flaws of human nature. And much like our human flaws this movie's flaws are in the vagueness and unpredictable nature of the characters. In essence a very good slice of a life I hope none of us ever have to experience. It begins with the odd and very strained relationship between father and son, Peter Boyle and Billy Bob Thornton. Then moves to the heartbreaking relationship between another father and son, Billy Bob and Heath Ledger. We follow one painful relationship after another, and when we meet Halle Berry, the pain begins all over again. Her husband is about to be executed (played very calmly and not too badly by Puff Daddy) and her overweight son compensates for his lack of a father and a mother constantly on the edge of poverty by binge eating on candy he keeps hidden in his room. Okay with out giving away actual plot points that sums up the basic characters of the story. As for performance, all four main characters were riveting. Peter Boyle is so very good at being nasty, Heath Ledger is painful in this very unglamorous role, but very very good.  Billy Bob is amazing in his confusion over his son, and his love for a black woman when he has spent his life under his father's shadow, as a racist. And miss Halle Berry... wow, she made me cry at least three times, she was wonderful. She does not deserve the Oscar because she is the first black woman to be nominated for best actress, she deserves it because she earned it. Denzil Washington said it best, (paraphrasing) well I hope we three (Will Smith, Halle Berry, and Washington) are nominated because we deserve it, not 'cause we're black and as far as I can see, the media can press the black issue all they want, but all three deserved the nominations they received for their performances. so in a new rating system I will give it four out of a possible five stars, and this simple warning, yep the sex is explicit so if you are uncomfortable with that, wait for video and then run to the bathroom during that scene. It is very obvious when it is about to happen. But don't expect glamour, this scene is not about how beautiful Halle Berry is, this is not sex with hollywood style, it is about the pain and devastating loss of love and what we do to get a small amount of relief from a very painful reality. Very well done. ","genre":null},{"date":"19 March 2002","score":"","review":"  Two things must be said right away.

This is a movie that will hit you hard.  It was incredibly shocking and disturbing at times but it presents some great themes and isn't to be labelled as simply another anti-drug movie or a film that's only purpose is to make you feel miserable.  Before I talk about the movie's themes though I just want to quickly praise some of the other brilliant features of the film. First, the cinematography is amazing.  This is probably one of the best shot movies that I can think of.  The director does an amazing job here and I think that this is what has some people passing the movie off as just some artsy film with no real message.  Not true however. The acting in the film is top notch as well.  All actors deliver amazing performances, surprisingly, including Marlon Wayans.  He should really consider moving on to more dramatic performances.  Jared Leto is excellent and the woman that played his mother should have won an oscar.  You'll have to watch this movie to get the full idea of this as words alone cannot express how good she was.  Jennifer Connelly also gives an amazing performance. Now, onto the themes of this movie.  This movie is by no means simply an anti-drug movie. The director is smart enough to realize that there is enough anti-drug films out there.  He wouldn't have made this movie if his sole intent was just to dissuade people from taking drugs.  To put it simply, this movie is anti-that which gives us false hope.  There is a reason that the mother in the film loves watching TV and dreams about getting on that show.  Whether it be drugs, the media, or anything else, the director is pointing out that these things, which brainwash us, are wrong. While they may give us a temporary sense of hope, in the end, they only crush our dreams and our lives.  Look at the title of the movie Requiem For A Dream.

Mostly, the soundtrack worked the pumping dark techno added to the futuristic suspense, but everytime there was a song with lyrics, it cheapens the film.2.  CGI.  Not having ever played RE, I don't really see what the mutants really contribute to the movie.  I'm sure the sequel will make this make more sense.  Personally the zombies were much more scary than the tongue monster.  When is hollywood going to learn that audiences are not scared by CGI monsters, we say, wow that's cool, and then get scared by something as cheap as someone grabbing another person in a tense situation.  But anyways.The GoodThe zombies were fantastic.  Some people think that they were cheap looking. Have you ever seen one of the best horror movies ever?  Dawn of the Dead? The zombies in that are little more than people with grey pancake makeup on. In RE the zombies have creative makeup, and most have some icky wounds.  I loved the scene where they opened the door and all the zombies came rushing out (ripped off of dawn of the dead, but its about time someone ripped off a good movie for once instead of scream), it was one of the best scares, eventhough anyone who's seen Dawn knows whats coming.Milla was also great.  She kicked major butt!  And she did it wearing the least amount of clothing possible.  If that's what women will be wearing in the future, build me a time machine.  The supporting actors, while underdeveloped, added to the story (except for Rain, who was annoying, and i couldn't wait for her demise).The flashbacks Milla had were also wonderful.  Very very eerie, especially the lab scene and the graveyard.  By the way, the german chick playing Lisa, we American audiences need more of her.  She would've made a great zombie.The other really great thing  The red queen.  The film makers have stumbled upon the best horror theory  little girls with english accents are beyond creepy.  If you don't believe me, watch the others, or the innocents.With the exception of minor flaws, this was a good movie, not a classic, but for a video game inspired plot starring a supermodel, this movie went way above my expectations.Please be warned though, seeing Milla nude at the end of the movie is not sexy at all.  Don't expect to pop some wood, amazingly the filmmaker has managed to make us repulsed by her nudity, you'll understand once you've seen it.7.5 out of 10 for a horror 9 out of 10 for a video game inspired movie (even that can't make me forget the CGI monster) ","genre":null},{"date":"19 March 2002","score":"","review":"  Resident Evil.
