Even those who aren't die-hard time-travel film fans will enjoy the quirky plot points such as the world's oldest long-distance stock tip as well as the genuinely tender moments between father and son in both the 1969 scenes and over the radio receiver.The ending itself was acceptable and fit in with the plot, but the music that accompanied the very last scene was a distraction. In fact, a negative comment about that country music was the first thing I heard when the lights went up. This is nothing against country music, but after all, the film took place in Queens, NY. The ending cries out for an instrumental version of Take me out to the ball game, which would have been just as moving - perhaps more, because of how prominent baseball figured in the plot. Maybe they should change it in the video release. Despite this small flaw, Frequency is a nine, and well worth seeing in the theaters. DO NOT MISS THIS FILM!

He has a peculiar, disturbing, raw and perverse vision of the humanity, and in great part of his motion pictures, explosive and controversial themes like rape, incest, murder and homosexuality are analyzed in a cold and honest way. The Fly's main character is Seth Brundle (Jeff Goldblum, giving his career's  best performance), a brilliant scientist who works with insistence in the Telepods two capsules that supposedly are capable of disintegrating a body and transport it to another capsule in which it is reintegrated. Seth meets an attractive and ambitious reporter (Geena Davis) in a party and the two fall in love. She starts to share with him the experiences, but something comes out wrong when Seth uses his own body for the experiment - his genetic cells are mixed up with the DNA of a fly. This is the beginning of a nightmare that will throw Seth in a mutation process. The mutation will turn him progressively into an implacable monster. Cronenberg made a film that doesn't follow the basic formulas of the gender. The Fly is not exactly a horror movie, but a mixture of drama, romance and, of course, a lot of violence, blood and gore. The Fly is so violent that makes Hellbound Hellraiser 2 look like a Disney film.The magnificent special effects took home the Oscar in 1987, and even after 14 years, the scenes in which Goldblum progressively melts down,  shocks for its realism. The director doesn't spare the audience and, unlike The Blair Witch Project, that scared just suggesting, he maintains the cameras in focus, documenting exaggerating cruelty scenes. Jeff Goldblum never delivered such intense acting in all of his career after The Fly. Without a doubt, this film deserves to be a part of any movie lover's collection  - buy the movie. Twentieth Century Fox  did with The Fly the same thing they did for Alien (1979), they released with a lot of excellence a terrific DVD, bringing extras, back stages and an excellent image and sound.

The movie was being pitched as the latest and greatest Roman Empire film of all time, a modern return to the days of Cecil B. DeMille and the old epic films. The scale of the film is impressive, and some scenes do breach the pale and reach moments of genius, but unfortunately they are few and far between, and for the most part the film plays like just another period action flick. However, though it doesn't reach the heart and spirit of BRAVEHEART, the film achieves moments of greatness and admiration which defy overtly sentimental nostalgia.  In the end, the film is about a man who defies great odds in his quest for justice and peace.  It is the story of a man of honor and integrity who must overcome tyranny, deception, injustice, brutality and even his own insatiable hunger for revenge.  It succeeds on this level.Russell Crowe (THE INSIDER, LA CONFIDENTIAL, VIRTUOUSITY) does well as General Maximus who is cast into slavery and who must fight and kill to survive as a gladiator in late second century Rome.  Add into the mix a dabble of cliche' political intrigue (an unworthy Roman despot Caesar Commodus -- played to a tee by Joaquin Phoenix (8MM, CLAY PIGEONS, INVENTING THE ABBOTTS) -- kills his ailing father who just happens to be Caesar Marcus Aurelius (played by the venerable Richard Harris (UNFORGIVEN, A MAN CALLED HORSE, MUTINY ON THE BOUNTY) in order to succeed to the throne.  Like Shakespeare's HAMLET, this act of familial homicide fuels the plot and drives the characters to their eventual destinies in the Coliseum.Other players of worthy mention  the lovely Connie Nelson (MISSION TO MARS, PERMANENT MIDNIGHT, DEVIL'S ADVOCATE), who plays Lucilla, daughter of Aurelius, sister and near love slave to Commodus, his successor; and Oliver Reed (THE BRUCE, THE THREE MUSKETEERS, TOMMY and a bunch of great Poe adaptions and Hammer films).  Unfortunately, Reed died during production, but his performance on screen as gladiator turned gladiator-owner Proximo is superb and one his best!  Easily.The music for the film surpasses a great many period-piece scores which border on the pretentious and uninspired.  This score for Gladiator is at once moving, powerful, emotive and  most importantly interesting.  It doesn't attract attention to itself, yet it manages to support the story quite nicely. Composed by Hans Simmer (CRIMSON TIDE and THE ROCK) with assistance by ethereal vocalist Lisa Gerrard, much of the music approaches the greatness of those soundtracks which stand on their own as great pieces of music vis-a-vis Peter Gabriel's THE LAST TEMPTATION OF CHRIST.My biggest criticism of the film has to do with Ridley Scott and the cinematography.  Most of the action scenes, especially the battle scenes are all close-ups and tight shots.  This lends to visual confusion, blurriness and a general lack of clarity.  While such an effect might lend itself thematically to the heat of the battle, it does nothing to aid the viewer who is watching the film and looking for details, clear images and who is trying to pay attention to what is happening.  Even the gladiator matches themselves were all tight shots, and though well choreographed, they were at times difficult to follow and even tiring on the eyes.  The medium and long range shots of the great epics were absent.  The look of pictures by DeMille which helped propel films like THE TEN COMMANDMENTS, SAMSON AND DELILAH or Sam Zimbalist's BEN HUR into epic status were left out of Ridley Scott's vision, and for the most part the picture remains on the level of MAD MAX or even Scott's previous epic, 1492 CONQUEST OF PARADISE. Interestingly enough, Scott used cinematographer John Mathieson whose previous work includes French films LOVE IS THE DEVIL and VIGO, but nothing to the scale of vision GLADIATOR deserves.  Someone like Vilmos Zsigmond (GHOST AND THE DARKNESS) could've really brought a sense of bigness to the visuals which is lost in GLADIATOR.In any case, the film is worthy of a solid three stars.  It's predictable as hell, but it's great action.  The violence is graphic and nasty, but thoroughly essential to the plot and none of it is gratuitous.  The players perform at a high level and are believable.  Costumes and sets are well made and create a brilliant setting for the film.  One other criticism is the use of hokey floating dream sequences which, like the lackluster cinematography, undermine the grand scale of the picture.  With a budget of $100 million and both Dreamworks and Universal Studios behind the picture, the film could have gone without the cheesy Roger Corman \/ Fred Olan Ray style effects.  They really are distracting and detract from the overall effect of the film.

Connie Nielson is also well cast as Lucilla. A real beauty, (think Sharon Stone), her scenes with Maximus are first rate. The other cast members did a good job as well.  I would point out the boy who played Lucius only to say that he is a far better child actor than the one who played Anakin Skywalker in The Phantom Menace.  As for Joaquin Phoenix, I wanted him to be more psycho, in that while he succeeded in making Commodus disturbing, I found myself laughing at him more than I was scared of him.  There were times when I simply wanted to tell Commodus to go to his room, and I would've done it without fear of reprisals, but I'm not sure if that's Phoenix's fault so much as it's the script's.The costumes are wonderful!!!  Especially Lucilla's outfits, and her jewelry and makeup are perfect as well.  The battle gear and gore make-up are also well done.Visual effects-wise, the inside of the Colosseum is great, but the rest of Rome seems so fake.  While breathtaking, it is obviously computer generated. As for the battle\/action scenes, they seem rushed and choppy.  The opening scene for example, both visually and audially (esp. the arrows) reminds me of Star Wars for some reason, but I digress.

The rest of the action scenes seem to follow the same pattern--great general set-up, horrible follow through.  The lighting however was well done in terms of when and how it was used to fit the theme of the movie.While obviously leaning on the action scenes with its epic proportions and gory grandeur to draw in and entertain the movie-going audience, the movie would have been better off focusing on the more intimate and human interest side of the story.  The best scenes in the movie were the ones that took place out of the sight of glorious Rome with its architectural wonders, its mob-like masses, and its moral corruption.  Those shot in dark, dank corners between two or three people, esp. those between Maximus and Lucilla, were fantastic and did more to draw me into the lives of the characters, where the real story should take place, than any that dealt with the fate of Rome.The Gladiator is still a movie that I would recommend to others however, if only to make sure that Russell Crowe and Connie Nielson get the recognition that they deserve.

I thought that Phoenix played a great part as Commodus giving the role a certain amount of believability compared to some of the derranged depictions of Roman Emporers that have gone before. Russell Crowe also makes his character come to life holding the whole movie together. On the accuracy side the film gives a very accurate depiction of the colliseum but the other shots of Rome in the background are fanciful to say the least.The first gladiatorial sequence gives a real feel for the total lack of value placed on human life by the Romans however I don't think the true horror of the collisseum comes through in this picture. The typical day at the colliseum was split in three with the first part of the day belonging to the beast hunts. Where up to a hundred lions, bears, bulls elephants etc would be made to fight each other and teams of besterai(beast fighters) also convicted criminals and slaves would be lead into the ring in chains, the chains would be removed and the person striped naked and forced to meet the lions etc by poding with red hot branding irons often the people would be hung from different types of contraptions to make it more difficult for the animals to get a clean kill. Death by a lion was considered a clean kill as the animal would kill its victim in short order, smaller carnivores where often used and the victim would be hardly recognisable as a human before the death blow was finally administered by the staff to enable the later shows to continue. Midday brought out the slightly more favoured criminals who where made to fight each other to the death the winner staying on until he meet his death. Once again the application of branding irons to reluctant victims ensure entertainment for the masses. The afternoon brought the Gladiatorial fights as depicted in the movie. The bodies of the victims where branded to ensure death. If any life was left a blow was applied to the cranium to finish the job, a hook was then stuck in the carcasses gut and a horse was used to drag out the body and was thrown into large pits near the colliseum kept for such purposes.I am not sure that this sort of horror could be depicted in a modern movie as not only would it be censored but it is so outrageous that a modern audience would think it lacked credulity. Commodus also as depicted in the movie was a more loveable character than the one described in the histories of the times but yet again his depravities would not suit the censors.All in all great entertainment though.

Harry Dean Stanton and Annie Potts play the adult roles of substance. Have you ever seen Stanton so sympathetic? A very upbeat soundtrack keeps the movie flowing and helps you feel the atmosphere. Don't write this off as just another teen movie. Highly recommended.   ","genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance"}]
