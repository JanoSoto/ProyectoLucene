Then came Thunderball which, in my opinion, is the worst (yes, even behind Diamonds are Forever).It's just too slow and too long. Although, when I check the running time, it's not that much longer than other Bond movies (past and present). It just feels much longer. Some of the 'action' scenes are painfully slow - largely because 'underwater' features heavily in the film's plot (about Spectra trying to blackmail the world governments using nuclear weapons). What you get is 'action' scenes set underwater, therefore they're - by definition - slow moving and it's hard to tell who's who with all the scuba gear. They just go on forever and should have been cut (in my humble opinion).I would leave it there by saying that Thunderball is my least favourite Connery Bond film, however, upon reading the other reviews, I find that I'm actually in the minority.

Then a rescue mission is quickly launched, which also go awry...The movie is still nice and entertaining, but up to a certain point. The entire sequence with the first landing on Mars was excellent. It was nicely constructed, filmed and put together and there was a sense of thrill and excitement to it all. And when it went awry, you really were struck down as you root for the astronauts here. But moving on... As the second landing is on its way, the movie still manages to uphold its grasp on the audience, because it is equally exciting and thrilling. And so was it when they go to Mars. Right up to the point where they entered the giant stone head structure. From there on it just was like the air deflated from the balloon very quickly.The sequence with the pre-history of Mars was interesting and it was an interesting aspect and approach to take on the barren planet. But the alien creature? Seriously? That was when the movie slipped beyond any chance of salvation, and to make matters worse Jim decides to stay in the alien craft and travel home. Yeah, that was just really great! (Read the irony here!)Storywise, then Mission to Mars is great and it is well executed on the screen. The story easily picks up the audience in its grasp and doesn't let go before the very well. Well, for me, about 10 to 15 minutes or so before the end (as they went into the structure).They had some good talents in the movie as well, especially Tim Robbins put on a great performance here, and was perhaps the most memorable of all characters in the entire movie. But with a cast that also included Gary Sinise, Don Cheadle and Connie Nielsen it was just a good ensemble.As for the effects, well I will say that they pulled it off quite nicely, and it does give off the sense that the people were on Mars. Well, aside from the gravity issue going on. But hey, let's not dwell on details.I was thoroughly entertained by Mission to Mars, but I just wished for an alternate ending, because that ending was just preposterous.

But the alien creature? Seriously? That was when the movie slipped beyond any chance of salvation, and to make matters worse Jim decides to stay in the alien craft and travel home. Yeah, that was just really great! (Read the irony here!)Storywise, then Mission to Mars is great and it is well executed on the screen. The story easily picks up the audience in its grasp and doesn't let go before the very well. Well, for me, about 10 to 15 minutes or so before the end (as they went into the structure).They had some good talents in the movie as well, especially Tim Robbins put on a great performance here, and was perhaps the most memorable of all characters in the entire movie. But with a cast that also included Gary Sinise, Don Cheadle and Connie Nielsen it was just a good ensemble.As for the effects, well I will say that they pulled it off quite nicely, and it does give off the sense that the people were on Mars. Well, aside from the gravity issue going on. But hey, let's not dwell on details.I was thoroughly entertained by Mission to Mars, but I just wished for an alternate ending, because that ending was just preposterous.

Then a rescue mission is quickly launched, which also go awry...The movie is still nice and entertaining, but up to a certain point. The entire sequence with the first landing on Mars was excellent. It was nicely constructed, filmed and put together and there was a sense of thrill and excitement to it all. And when it went awry, you really were struck down as you root for the astronauts here.

I was entertained when I saw it, but also somewhat disappointed; an odd mix. Viewing it again last night I was wondering if I'd have the same impression and the answer is yes.The story revolves around a group of young-ish scientists (who are too edgy and hip to be believable) working on a serum for the government that can make people invisible. Their secret lab is underground in an industrial sector of Washington DC. They've been experimenting on animals, including a gorilla, with some success, but the group leader, Sebastian (Kevin Bacon), wants to take the next step by prematurely experimenting on himself. Havok ensues.Elisabeth Shue and Josh Brolin play key teammembers, Linda and Matthew. Linda is also Sebastian's ex-girlfriend who's secretly seeing Matthew, which stirs Sebastian's jealousy when he finds out. (But why should he care since he's no longer seeing her?) I don't know if it's the fault of the director or writer, but they go a little overboard in trying to make the protagonists edgy (overkill cussing, etc.) to the point that the characters somewhat lose the viewer's sympathy. Thankfully, it's just a little overboard because most of the rest of the researchers are likable beyond Sebastian. And Linda and Matthew weren't really doing anything wrong by seeing each other since, again, Linda was no longer Sebastian's babe.Even though one member of the team morphs into the villain, he's not without interesting qualities in the first half of the movie. In fact, I can't help but respect his we're the originators of this project so we make the rules attitude and his consequent refusal to submit to the manipulative authorities over him.While there are some outside sequences (shot in DC and L.A.) the bulk of the film is confined to the underground lab, shot on sets in Culver City. The good thing is that these sets are excellent, as far as underground labs go, but it makes for a one-dimensional viewing.Memorable and amusing parts abound, however, like the excellent F\/X of the partially appearing\/disappearing gorilla and, later, Sebastian. Also, the amusing way invisible-Sebastian has some fun with a couple of kids in another car. There's also a laugh-out-loud joke about Superman, Wonder Woman and the Invisible Man, crude though it may be. I also like the double meaning of the title Sebastian isn't just a hollow man literally, but also due to his ignoble character -- arrogance, lust, etc.While Hollow Man is a sci-fi\/thriller it takes on horror elements and clichés in the final act as the researchers are wiped out one by one. Who will survive? So, while Hollow Man is worth watching, it's far from great, mainly because it fails to take advantage of the promising material and essentially becomes a one-dimensional boogeyman movie.GRADE B- ","genre":null},{"date":"12 September 2014","score":"","review":" I remember really looking forward to Hollow Man when it came out in 2000 because the idea of becoming invisible is intriguing.
