Basically the film opens in Ancient Egypt with Ema 'Emmy' Hasure (Sex and the City's Kim Cattrall) hiding in a pyramid to get away from her mother (Phyllis Newman) who is forcing her to get married, so she prays to the gods to send her to her true love, and she disappears. Forward to present day Philadelphia, where Jonathan Switcher (Andrew McCarthy) is a young artist, who starts out with a job making mannequins, but when he is fired he can't seem to find a job that he can keep. He made his perfect mannequin that makes him feel happy, and he is really surprised to see it in the window of the Prince & Company department store, and he happens to save the life of the old Claire Timkin (Estelle Getty) who owns it, she rewards him with a job as stock boy. One night staying late in the store Jonathan has a conversation with what is normally an inanimate dummy, but the mannequin he made comes to life, possessing the soul of Emmy, and she knows that he is to be her true life, he just sees her as a new friend. The next day he wakes up to see a very artistic setup of mannequins posing in the store window, and everyone assumes it was him, so he is put in charge of designing more of them to bring in more business. At first Jonathan assumed he was hallucinating the dummy coming to life, but Emmy does come to life again, and he realises that she helped create the setups, so every night they make these, have fun, and get closer. While customers are fascinated by the artistic store windows setups and being drawn to the store, there are the people who are saying he is getting too close to his mannequin, including his supposed girlfriend Roxie (Carole Davis) and Richards (James Spader) who wants to fire him, but camp and eccentric Hollywood (Meshach Taylor) knows his dummy means a lot to him. There obviously comes the point when rival stores try to cash in on Jonathan's success with their own similar ideas, Jonathan is taken away from the store, and Emmy is taken to a plant to be destroyed, but love prevails when she comes to life during the day (instead of night like usual), and they get married to live happily ever after. Also starring Police Academy's G.W. Bailey as Felix, Steve Vinovich as B.J. Wert and Christopher Maher as Armand. I can agree slightly that McCarthy is a bit more plastic than the mannequin he is in love with, Cattrall is nice and sweet as the dummy that comes to life and falls in love with him, and I personally didn't think Taylor was that annoying as his highly camp, bizarrely dressed and exuberant friend, I thought he was pretty funny, it doesn't have many great jokes, but it is a nice sweet film, and the song at the end of the film is worth waiting for, an alright romantic comedy. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Song for Starship - Nothing's Gonna Stop Us Now (it was also nominated the Golden Globe). Okay!

I have no doubt that one movie could possibly focus on everything that happened in the Civil Rights era, but I doubt it could do a very good job. Spike Lee has chosen one of the most unsung leaders of the movement, and has constructed, from the ground up, a film over three hours in length on him showing his humble beginnings, his rise to power, his self-assessment, and his tragic death.The leader is Malcolm X. But before he was an historical figure, he was Malcolm Little, a small-time thief who would concoct schemes to steal money with his best friend, Shorty. He was a smart boy, with a preacher for a father and a white woman for a mother. Despite being very smart, he was ostracized by white teachers who said that his dreams of becoming a lawyer wouldn't happen and that he should stick to working with his hands. Little's adolescence consisted of running around with white girls and devising burglaries with them and Shorty. This streak didn't last long, with Little and Shorty being arrested and sentenced to eight years in prison. Without a doubt, prison benefited Little in unlikely ways. He was taught the ways of Elijah Muhammad, the leader of the Nation of Islam, and got help for his addiction to cocaine by a fellow inmate.Muhammad's teachings eventually inspired Malcolm to become a motivational speaker, before becoming one of the many voices in the Civil Rights movement. He adopts the name Malcolm X, he claims, because X in mathematics represents the unknown. For a while, X preached the direct opposite from Martin Luther King Jr. King believed in integration, that would hopefully result from a nonviolent practice. X thought integrating with the enemy was not intelligent, and questioned why would we want to integrate with a group that has subtracted our rights, raped our women, and has dehumanized us? For a while, the only thing X said he liked integrated was his coffee. I tried to put myself in the shoes of a middle aged African American, living in the south, in the 1960's, and contemplated who I, myself, would've sided with. King would probably have been the initial person I would've sided with, but after many months that proved little to no success, I would've likely started to follow X and his teachings of self defense and segregation.The entire film is marvelous in every sense of the word. Spike Lee has proved himself to be one of America's greatest directors with one stellar drama after another, focusing mainly on racial tensions. Here, he brilliantly documents an underrated leader whose philosophy may have been sketchy, but wrote speeches that were undeniably powerful.X is portrayed by Denzel Washington, who utters every line with sophistication and always occupies a convincing state. The whole tone of the film can be summed up in one scene that comes rather late in the film. It shows Malcolm X walking up the stairs to Columbia University, where he is stopped by a white woman asking what she could do to further his movement. He coldly replies nothing before marching on his way. The camera is left focusing on the frozen, heartbroken woman. The great thing about a scene like this is that it wasn't motivated by a comic relief. Lee adds hints of comedy throughout the film, but not many seeing as this is a touchy subject. He feels he should attack it with brutal honesty rather than turn the whole movement into a laugh riot. Other performances, like Angela Bassett as Malcolm's wife, and Al Freeman Jr. as Elijah Muhammad, provide the film with some of its strongest material as well.I believe the reason the character of Malcolm X was so interesting is because he is capable of delivering self assessment and self criticism. Not many leaders are still developing their beliefs, but are rather wholly confident in what they preach. X finally realized he had flaws as a human, and went through a change of heart upon traveling to Mecca, an event that is captured beautifully in the film, and came back a whole different person. Instead of attacking Civil Rights leaders, mainly Martin Luther King Jr., and making them feel inferior, he agrees to work with them to pursue the dream of equality in the world.Malcolm X is one of the most surreal and extensive biopics I have yet to see. Its script is extremely powerful, and refuses to become dry and noneventful. Lee's direction is pitch perfect, and the tone either feels coldly realistic or unsettling even in when it reaches its brightest instances. Just like the man himself, Lee's film has proved to go under the radar, not boasting a great deal on the surface. But when put into an intricate focus and dissected delicately, it is one of the best films that deals with racial tensions, next to De Niro's A Bronx Tale, and one of the smartest films of the nineties decade.Starring Denzel Washington, Angela Bassett, and Al Freeman Jr. Directed by Spike Lee.

Despite being very smart, he was ostracized by white teachers who said that his dreams of becoming a lawyer wouldn't happen and that he should stick to working with his hands. Little's adolescence consisted of running around with white girls and devising burglaries with them and Shorty. This streak didn't last long, with Little and Shorty being arrested and sentenced to eight years in prison. Without a doubt, prison benefited Little in unlikely ways. He was taught the ways of Elijah Muhammad, the leader of the Nation of Islam, and got help for his addiction to cocaine by a fellow inmate.Muhammad's teachings eventually inspired Malcolm to become a motivational speaker, before becoming one of the many voices in the Civil Rights movement. He adopts the name Malcolm X, he claims, because X in mathematics represents the unknown. For a while, X preached the direct opposite from Martin Luther King Jr. King believed in integration, that would hopefully result from a nonviolent practice. X thought integrating with the enemy was not intelligent, and questioned why would we want to integrate with a group that has subtracted our rights, raped our women, and has dehumanized us? For a while, the only thing X said he liked integrated was his coffee. I tried to put myself in the shoes of a middle aged African American, living in the south, in the 1960's, and contemplated who I, myself, would've sided with. King would probably have been the initial person I would've sided with, but after many months that proved little to no success, I would've likely started to follow X and his teachings of self defense and segregation.The entire film is marvelous in every sense of the word. Spike Lee has proved himself to be one of America's greatest directors with one stellar drama after another, focusing mainly on racial tensions. Here, he brilliantly documents an underrated leader whose philosophy may have been sketchy, but wrote speeches that were undeniably powerful.X is portrayed by Denzel Washington, who utters every line with sophistication and always occupies a convincing state. The whole tone of the film can be summed up in one scene that comes rather late in the film. It shows Malcolm X walking up the stairs to Columbia University, where he is stopped by a white woman asking what she could do to further his movement. He coldly replies nothing before marching on his way. The camera is left focusing on the frozen, heartbroken woman. The great thing about a scene like this is that it wasn't motivated by a comic relief. Lee adds hints of comedy throughout the film, but not many seeing as this is a touchy subject. He feels he should attack it with brutal honesty rather than turn the whole movement into a laugh riot. Other performances, like Angela Bassett as Malcolm's wife, and Al Freeman Jr. as Elijah Muhammad, provide the film with some of its strongest material as well.I believe the reason the character of Malcolm X was so interesting is because he is capable of delivering self assessment and self criticism. Not many leaders are still developing their beliefs, but are rather wholly confident in what they preach. X finally realized he had flaws as a human, and went through a change of heart upon traveling to Mecca, an event that is captured beautifully in the film, and came back a whole different person. Instead of attacking Civil Rights leaders, mainly Martin Luther King Jr., and making them feel inferior, he agrees to work with them to pursue the dream of equality in the world.Malcolm X is one of the most surreal and extensive biopics I have yet to see. Its script is extremely powerful, and refuses to become dry and noneventful. Lee's direction is pitch perfect, and the tone either feels coldly realistic or unsettling even in when it reaches its brightest instances. Just like the man himself, Lee's film has proved to go under the radar, not boasting a great deal on the surface. But when put into an intricate focus and dissected delicately, it is one of the best films that deals with racial tensions, next to De Niro's A Bronx Tale, and one of the smartest films of the nineties decade.Starring Denzel Washington, Angela Bassett, and Al Freeman Jr. Directed by Spike Lee.

Even without understanding Danish, the body language and clear emotionality with the actors was convincing and I believed the progression of events and it made it feel as though the characters themselves were moving forward in their lives and not being fed lines by a director. The wildly contrasting emotions depicted were startling but effective; there would be moments of truly uncomfortable silence at the dinner table then the brother screaming at the top of his lungs. Sound was an interesting aspect of emotions for the film and differed for each character. Michael always had his emotions on the surface (especially anger) and would yell and curse constantly, and it is hard to watch him as a character disrupt Christian's emotionally charged silence. After the movie progresses and Christian calmly breaks that secretive silence, suddenly seeing Michael run about in chaos and fury is not so bad compared to the deep emotional pain inside Christian. The interesting Dogma style film angles and hand held techniques supplemented the realistic feel of the family interactions. The hand-held filming reinforced the Danish standard for artistic films as well as an added sense of realism in the storytelling. The family is rather strange and a bit crazy, but are believable in their characterization and the way the truths of the past emerge through the woodwork of a long family dinner wraps the viewer up into the plot and slowly reveals the darkness this family holds within them. The lack of a background score definitely supports the emotional transitions in the film; the vivid and natural sounds would lose some of their subtle power if there were instruments to distract from it. The lighting and carefully chosen settings of natural light help to remove any feeling of these terrible events being dreamlike. Keeping the story real-feeling puts the emphasis on how the abuse portrayed is not something just seen in this film, but also something that can happen to any of us. I appreciated how there was nothing miraculous that saved them from the horrors within their family, that fixing anything would have to come from within them. The mother as a witness to the abuse is an interesting and familiar figure; when she witnesses the abuse, does she act? Repress it? She simply goes on with her life, but that also rests some blame on her shoulders for not protecting her children. The little abuses grow into larger ones and they are all layered into one very dysfunctional family. The theme of denial or repression was one that pairs nicely with the one of abuse. At first when Christian reveals his dark relationship to his father, the family pretends it didn't happen and tries to continue on with the dinner rather than face reality. They do this several times, but once it becomes apparent that Christian is not lying, they are forced to face the discomfort. In the Dogma style, there is not supposed to be any superficial violence, and I would like to know more about how the violent scenes were filmed since I couldn't tell if they were genuine or not and it detracted from the realistic feel. Other than details like that, I felt the movie had few drawbacks beside the discomfort of viewing such a dark film. For a story full of such dark, horrific truths, the Dogma style was perfect to play out this story because it removes many of the Hollywood-esque techniques that make films larger than life. Without extra music, sweeping film angles, or manipulated settings the story is given a realistic quality that would otherwise be impossible. The Dogma style requires every event to have as little superficiality as possible, nothing fake or superimposed. In the world of films such as Avatar and Harry Potter which bend reality into fantastic alternative possibilities, a film such as Celebration has such a stark realism that strikes deeper than an epic adventure. This story could happen, and the movie-making technique doesn't have to manipulate what is depicted to convince the viewer of the film's realities beyond the acting. The themes of abuse, relationships and repression are portrayed skillfully in this realism and avoid the obstacle of believability that cookie-cutter films must overcome. The commentary this realism evokes on the health of relationships, owning up to truth and abuse is quite pungent and important.
