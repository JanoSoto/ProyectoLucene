I volunteered to go with my 29 year old sister to see this (because she loves Keanu), and it was a laughing riot!  I especially liked the characters Jon Favreau and Orlando Jones (the infamous 7UP guy) played.  The ensemble of the cast actually works and blends very well, despite their differences in looks and behavior.  Keanu Reeves displayed pretty decent acting as the teams leader.  It was hilarious, as a comedy is meant to be.  The soundtrack is also incredible!  How hilarious is a bunch of guys dancing to Gloria Gaynor's I Will Survive?  Twice?  Very.  I can't wait until the CD is released.  On a final note, you can be a football junkie or not, and still enjoy this movie, which is good to appeal to a bigger audience.  I personally think that this is Keanu's best, next to Speed and The Matrix.  A must-buy for any fan on video.

It is hard to imagine that he was not even nominated for best director in 1960.  I suppose his final satisfaction must have come in the endurance of this film's popularity after all the other nominees faded into obscurity.'Spartacus' is one of the great Hollywood epics and Kirk Douglas' defining role.  It is a brilliantly written screenplay that combines the struggle for freedom from oppression with a compelling love story in a setting that accurately depicts the majesty as well as the corruption of the Roman Empire.  The scenes depicting the political maneuvering of the Senate were priceless.Kubrick's work was nothing short of brilliant.  His attention to the details of the period was wonderful.  The orchestration of tens of thousands of extras in the battle scenes was phenomenal.  His presentation of the love scenes between Varinia and Spartacus were sensitive and compelling.  I was most impressed with his treatment of the slave army.  He put a human face on the slaves by showing mothers with their children and scenes of Spartacus walking among the people.  This completely wins the affections of the viewer.  His pacing was perfect and despite the film's length at over three hours, it did not seem to drag since there was always something fascinating on the screen.Kirk Douglas gave a powerful performance and created a character that was bigger than life.  He was strong and inspirational while simultaneously being gentle and kind.  Laurence Olivier gave a riveting performance Crassus.  He was cunning, imperious, consumed by ambition and utterly heartless.  It is hard to imagine a more nefarious bad guy.Jean Simmons has had an impressive acting career that has spanned more than 50 years.  She is both a great beauty and an enchanting actress.  She gave Varinia dignity, strength of character and a quiet seductiveness that played well off the power exuded from Douglas.  Their screen chemistry was both passionate and touching.Rounding out a great cast were Peter Ustinov who was terrific as the sniveling and cowardly Batiatius always conniving to profit from someone else's misfortunes, and Charles Laughton as the astute and duplicitous Gracchus, manipulating the Roman senate to his best advantage.This is among the best epics ever made and certainly among the top three films about the Roman Empire.  I rated it a 10\/10.  This film should be on every film buff's list of required viewing and is highly recommended for its moving story to anyone who hasn't seen it.

That's right - imagine a New York City before the arrival of Rudy Guiliani as mayor in 1994. 'Death Wish' was released in 1974 accurately portraying the condition of the city during the 1970's. The sequels to the original are complete rubbish, but the original was a hit. The movie was a commercial success while at the same time it was being crucified by critics for being too violent. Remember, this was over 25 years ago.Charles Bronson plays Paul Kersey, a typical Upper West Side liberal who <snicker> believes that criminals are not responsible for their actions and are victims or by-products of society. Unfortunately, this archaic point of view is horribly challenged when Mr. Kersey's family is brutally attacked by a group of ruthless animals. His wife is murdered, while his daughter is raped and left in a catatonic state. The police don't have enough manpower and evidence to catch the gang even though they sympathize with Mr. Kersey's plight.Kersey, overcome with grief and anger goes to Arizona for a desperately needed vacation. In Arizona he learns how to use a handgun and along with that the power and determination to fight back at the criminal element that took his beloved family away from him.The rest of the movie deals with Mr. Kersey's adventures in the city when the sun goes down. Soon, the overall crime rate plummets as criminals are shocked to learn that their victims are actually fighting back; the criminals are unable to deal with this and sulk back into the sewers where they come from. Meanwhile, the police do their best to find and capture this vigilante despite the decreasing crime rate.From this review, readers might this movie is a simple violent flick. This could not be further from the truth. 'Death Wish' offers viewers some profound questions to answer Would Mrs. Kersey and her daughter be all right if they owned a firearm? With all the hoopla over gun control recently, it's been proven time and again that people who arm themselves are less likely to be a victim of a violent crime, such as rape. Another question deals with the notion of revenge are Mr. Kersey's  actions wrong and unethical? Perhaps they are. However, if a close family member of yours was brutally assaulted, what would you do to preserve your state of mind as Mr. Kersey did.Ultimately, 'Death Wish' asks why bad things happen to good people. And why are the good people crucified for fighting back against those who they fear? As James Madison said, government wouldn't be necessary if all men are angels. However, not every person is not an angel. Unfortunately, Mr. Kersey learned that truth the hard way.
