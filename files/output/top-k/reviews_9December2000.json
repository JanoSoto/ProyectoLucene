It's set out like a vampire movie, but it's a lot more original than your typical vampire movie. If you're a gorehound, or horror fan getting a bit tired of vampire movies, this cannibal movie will make a pleasant diversion. It undeservedly flopped at the box office, and it's one of the underrated movies of last year. 7.5\/10.
