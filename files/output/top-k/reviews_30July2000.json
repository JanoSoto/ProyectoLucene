Take every element of the film process and insert the word bad before it and you'll get the idea. It boggles the imagination how a studio could bankroll something like this, release it, advertise it, and actually get it shown by theaters. What an incredible waste of resources and viewer's time.

The scenes of Reagan when she was becoming more and more possessed by the devil are absolutely horrifying; I don't think they can ever be outdated. Those of you who don't think those scenes were scary have apparently had too many encounters with Satan yourselves and are just too used to that sort of thing! Or, maybe you just thought it seemed too fake. But that kind of thing really happens to people - maybe not the distortion of their faces and voices in such a way - but that's why there are so many evil people in the world. Anyway, I've never seen anything so scary but it was awesome watching God, the GOOD supernatural force on the other end of the spectrum, working to protect Reagan and the others in the movie. The only thing that bothered me about this movie that I couldn't get past was that the doctors who first examined her when she was starting to act strange didn't seem at all horrified by the way she was acting - and more notably, by the way her voice was changing! They seemed puzzled by it, but that was about it. Only her mother seemed rightly horrified by it, and even she didn't freak out as much as I would expect a mother with a Satan-possessed child to!

Instead I came out of the movie with a new all-time favorite. I can't decide where to start on what I liked most. The acting was absolutely brilliant. I have a great amount of respect for Russell Crowe now, due to the strength and compassion he put into this film. However, I feel that Joaquin Phoenix did the best job in acting. He took a character that could have been one huge cliche, and turned him into a sadistic and cruel villian that you actually had a reason to despise.This preformance alone has turned me into a huge fan. All people involved in this film are deserving of any awards they might receive. The manner in which the film was shot was breath-taking. From Germanian forests to Rome, the scenery in this film is amazing. I am also a huge fan of the soundtrack. Rarely has a soundtrack nearly brought me to tears, but this one does almost any time I hear it. Listening to it alone brings back emotions that I've never felt listening to a soundtrack. It's about time that there is a film out there now that makes you want to cheer for the hero, hiss at the villian and see the movie over and over again. Hopefully Hollywood will follow suit with more films like this in the near future.

There *are* some decent cast carry-overs from the original movie but they are wasted (as is just about everything else about this movie). I'm sure they must have later regretted lending their considerable names to this disaster.I have rarely heard so many forgettable (read terrible) songs in one movie. Don't waste your time on this one. Stick with the original. It's incomparably better.

I remember responding to those who did not like either film and challenging them to describe what the point of the two films are.  Nobody gave much of an intelligent response.  Many focused solely on the rape scene in Orange, and a few did not realize that in Strangelove, Peter Sellers played Mandrake, the President, and Dr. Strangelove. Upon explaining certain aspects and targets of Strangelove and Orange, I usually received an oh, now I get it.  I am certain that the very same brilliant individuals who initially had contempt for those two movies are blasting Eyes Wide Shut.  Not very surprising.Eyes Wide Shut is, as most Kubrick films are, a brilliantly shot movie and well-acted, and although the story did drag a little longer than I wished it had, it still was an excellent movie.  There were no real incredible acting performances, but incredible acting has always been an accident in most Kubrick films.  Kubrick makes films that are technically perfect and well-acted.  Only a handful of performances in his films could be called brilliant.  George C. Scott, Sterling Hayden, Peter Sellers, Slim Pickins, Malcolm McDowell, Michael Bates, Patrick Magee, R.

The fact is that Entrapment is not a great film, nor a bad one.

In resume Entrapment is a (very) flawed film, but one that doesn't bother you for its lack of quality.The story... Well, let's not worry about the story. But one thing I found really peculiar (in the bad sense) was how they introduced Catherine Zeta-Jones' character. You know where she works, what she does, how she dresses, what are her plans... You just don't know a single detail her name. One of the newsgroup critics noticed the same thing as me, and it clearly shows how full of holes this movie is. But it doesn't mean it is bad. The chemistry between Zeta-Jones and Connery is pretty fine. Both of them are charming, both of them are limited actors. Even with that, they are a delight together, helped by the great style of the movie.Entrapment starts off slow, has many disposable scenes, but its climax is the worst part.

RIPLEY this past weekend. I had heard rumors from others who were dissatisfied with this film, unhappy with their reaction to Anthony Minghella's follow-up to his majorly successful The English Patient. Just the fact that Minghella directed it made me quiver. English Patient has to be one of my most hated films for which much praise was received. However, something compelled me to pick it up. Maybe Minghella deserved another chance in my books. This time, he was using marquee actors of a more popular nature, rather than artsy-type thespians like Kristin Scott Thomas and Juliette Binoche. The moment I popped the DVD in and viewed this picture, I was hooked and enthralled. The Talented Mr. Riply uses just the right amount of artistry and goes thick on plot and method acting to create a thriller which the great Hitchcock would have been proud of.I must admit the previews made me take interest in this film before I considered looking at it. The plot seemd so fascinating, and it surely is. I'll only mention the minute details of it so as not to spoil anything for those who have not seen it, and also so I don't screw up some of the descriptions. Tom Ripley (Matt Damon) is a bland, ordinary individual who longs to become someone else other than the nobody who is himself. He gets that opportunity when a man named Greenleaf (James Rebhorn) offers him $1,000 to retrieve his son from Europe, whom he suspects is frittering his money and his life away. Ripley takes on the assignment, and surprisingly, as soon as he meets up with Dickie Greenleaf (Jude Law), he immediately tells him his intentions and quickly becomes his best buddy. His girlfriend, Marge (Gwyneth Paltrow) is also very impressed with their new acquaintance. Little do they know that Tom Ripley's main talent is impersonating people around him, taking on their identities and making them his own. Dickie's will be his first one to capture.I mentioned that Sir Alfred would have been pleased to see this film if he were alive today, and while I was watching Ripley, I couldn't help but be amazed by the technical and narrative similarities to Hitch's archetypes, which today are endlessly duplicated. I found it riveting how the plot and the director focus in on the scheming of Ripley, allowing the audience to be swept up in his improvisation and daring manner of always running under the knife. I don't know if the DVD technology is a considerable enhancement here, but Minghella's direction also takes on a life of its own. The purposeful shading and camera angles take on almost a voyeuristic quality, as if we the viewer are objectively but holistically involved in Ripley's feats of derring-do. The cinematography is fancy, but not overly distracting. Its viewpoint is always set on the characters and how they relate with each other.The performances are carefully choreographed but consistently drawn to look natural and of-the-moment. Such aspects are especially important in the case of Matt Damon, who takes the character of Tom Ripley and subtly makes him look pathetic but endlessly interesting to watch. Jude Law plays such a three-dimensional character here that his might be the most difficult one to play among the key players. Dickie Greenleaf (the real one) must be outgoing and friendly but also cold and disheartening. We may be repelled by him, but his fate never seems warranted, even during his most tragic hour. Gwyneth is beautiful as always, but also finds the right note for a woman who is unrightfully left behind and deceived by both these leading men. Cate Blanchett also has a small and thankless role as an innocent European traveller who happens upon this happy throng, totally unaware of the deception and indecency that is going on. She was probably my favorite character of them all, a symbol that Hitchcock created many years before.When critics and film fans remarked that the end of 1999 saw some of the best films in a blue moon hit theaters, I am inclined to believe them. Along with other favorites of mine like The Green Mile and American Beauty, I would vote for The Talented Mr. Ripley as one of the best films of the year. It is smart, visually and narratively creative, and on a whole, a truly satisfying entertainment. For thinking viewers, it is a special treat. For casual moviegoers, I believe there is still much to behold in this film, even if you are not one who is used to letting movies soak into your system. Minghella takes his time unwinding this ingenious tale, but the unfolding of the plot and the eventual pay-off is a chilling and fulfilling movie experience.

RIPLEY this past weekend. I had heard rumors from others who were dissatisfied with this film, unhappy with their reaction to Anthony Minghella's follow-up to his majorly successful The English Patient. Just the fact that Minghella directed it made me quiver. English Patient has to be one of my most hated films for which much praise was received. However, something compelled me to pick it up. Maybe Minghella deserved another chance in my books. This time, he was using marquee actors of a more popular nature, rather than artsy-type thespians like Kristin Scott Thomas and Juliette Binoche. The moment I popped the DVD in and viewed this picture, I was hooked and enthralled. The Talented Mr. Riply uses just the right amount of artistry and goes thick on plot and method acting to create a thriller which the great Hitchcock would have been proud of.I must admit the previews made me take interest in this film before I considered looking at it.

Rating Four stars ","genre":"Crime, Drama, Thriller"},{"date":"30 July 2000","score":"","review":"  Scream 3 is the supposed climatic ending to the supposedly legendary Scream franchise.  While Scream packed a wollup on its first viewing, it didn't hold it's fear factor much on any viewing after that.  Scream 2 was a much more by-the-numbers horror film, and while it's ending was a bit more predictable, it had a few genuine shocks and scares.  Scream 3 has none of this, in fact the only highlight of this movie was the cameo of Jay and Silent Bob (Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith).Neve Campbell reprises her role of Sidney, who has moved into hiding in a secluded part of California (the H20 hideaway Kevin???).  She has changed her name to Laura and become a women's crisis center operator.   Not quite what her first two performances in this series were, but good enough for this one.The other vets returning for this one are Liv Schreiber, Courtney Cox-Arquette, David Arquette.  All play their respective characters just passable enough to say that they actually pretended to care.I'm not gonna bother with the supporting cast much except to say that Scott Foley (Felicity) obviously can act better than Noel shows, and that Kelly Rutherford deserved better.  Most of the characters were forgettable and dull.  Jenny McCarthy killed her career with her role in this one, and I'm gonna let those words serve as the proverbial final shovel of dirt.Nice touch again with Jay & Silent Bob and I do have to give kudos for the videotaped return of Randy...his character was one of the better ones in the series, and it was so great that they included him in this.Were the multiple script rewrites to blame for this one turning out as badly as it did?  Probably pretty likely.  It would be very hard as an actor to care about the film after the writers themselves change it time and time again.  I've heard rumors of Scream 4, could it be because Wes Craven wants to try to end the series on a good note?  Will we have to endure Wes Craven's New Scream???  Only time will tell, but God willing, we'll be able to take Wes at his word and say that this scream will be the last.1\/2 out of 5 ","genre":null},{"date":"30 July 2000","score":"","review":"  Scream 3 is the supposed climatic ending to the supposedly legendary Scream franchise.
