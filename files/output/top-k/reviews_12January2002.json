Not enough background history and a shoddy ending makes this movie much less complete. Im sure that this is true to the book, but the movie lacks the storyline to stand alone in theaters.

I did this and at first I thought the movie was a disappointing.  I found the story to be complicated and I didn't understand the actions of the characters.   I decided to watch it againIt took me 3 viewings to get a total grasp of the plot and character motivations, which is what I think a good movie should do.So, you MUST PAY ATTENTION to the story.  If you leave the film for even a minute, and you may be confused throughout the rest of the film.So what if there isn't one good guy in the whole cast.  Isn't everyone sick of that formula hollywood c**p?  If you want good guys vs bad guys go watch a Michael Bay film.  Each character is played perfectly and the script is top-notch, better than the pop-culture conversations you find in Tarantino's overrated movies (all of them).  The action sequences take place as part of the plot and I thought they were very clever and innovative.  The gun usage and the sounds of the guns were very accurate.  The soundtrack is way cool and the direction is first class, especially for a first-time director.  I loved some of the camera placements that were used, with effective uses of zooming out to change the nature of the scene.I hope to see more from McQuarrie and hear more from Joe Kraemer (music) in the future.

However, Argento is not a good storyteller. In almost all the movies I've seen by him, I was either bored or confused by the story. Suspiria is one of the better ones on that account. It's considered a horror masterpiece, but while I do not agree with that, I appreciate certain scenes and definitely Argento's style.The scene for example where the blind man walks on the piazza with his dog is perfect. It's scary, beautifully photographed and masterly edited. There are other sequences that stand out. But overall, I was still disappointed. It was the first movie I've seen by Argento. I didn't like it much the first time I've seen it (the uncut version by the way). Later, I've watched other Argento movies and returned to Suspiria. I liked it more the second time around but finally decided that Argento is highly overrated and he is not my kind of film maker. Suspiria might be his best work, but it's still not a great movie.Rating 6\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"12 January 2002","score":"4 out of 8 people found the following review useful","review":"  Dario Argento is the film maker horror fans have picked out to find recognition among mainstream critics & film fans His style is amazing, his choice of music remarkable, the atmosphere he creates genuinly creepy and the gore very well integrated into the story.

Ryan Gosling gives a brilliant performance as Danny an exceptionally bright young Jewish man who lives a double life, when he becomes involved with weird right wing 'neo nazis' and conceals his Jewishness from them. Danny's rejection of the religious and moral strictures of orthodox Judaism has a narcisstic and nihilistic edge to it, he says the Jews 'are nothing'. He becomes close to a creepy 'intellectual' right-wing couple and becomes attracted to their daughter Carla (Summer Phoenix) and has an affair with her. Unlike her stepfather and mother, Carla has some degree of sensitivity and questions Danny's anti-semitic views.In the meantime, Danny has to keep his Jewish past hidden and he is rumbled a journalist whom he threatens with his own suicide if the story is published. He becomes deeply involved with racist skinheads and plants a bomb in a synagogue. It is here, when Danny sees the damage and desecration to the Torah that his 'Jewishness' returns. He tells his fellow skins not to damage the Torah and takes it home with him. Danny repairs the damaged scrolls, and Carla starts to become curious about his behaviour. What stretches my incredulity in this film is when the naked Carla is reading the holy book and Danny demands that she put her clothes on. All of a sudden Danny is transformed back to being an orthodox Jew demanding that a woman should not be naked infront of a man. Danny's intimate knowledge of Judaism raises suspicion amongst his skinhead colleagues. He is also sent on 'sensitivity training' as an alternative to prison for the desecration of the synagogue. He hears horrific stories from Holocaust survivors but mocks and insults them. This scene I found hard to bear, particularly the idea of the State posing as a sensitive and neutral arbitrator on the issue of racism.The films premise lacks credibility and it is hard to sympathise with Danny and his destructive self-hatred, which he seems to blame on the rigid inflexibility of his religious upbringing. In spite of his religion, Danny lives in New York, a modern secular city. Why would such a bright person want to get involved with right-wing cranks when there are far more opportunities available to him in modern American society? Also, the concept of 'Jewishness' as a cultural identity, is awkwardly posited, one minute Danny is a repulsive fascist convert and then suddenly the sight of the Torah and religious garments turns him back into a Jew. Danny's demise when he blows himself up at a synagogue does not arouse much sympathy with me, as he, and nobody else, has willed on his own destruction. The film is confusing in its narrative structure and it forces issues down the viewers' throats. Anti-semitism is not a major social problem in America and most Jews and other ethnic groups are not under threat by a ramshackle bunch of racist, 'neo nazi' non entities. In fact Jews are one of the most assimilated groups in modern America and the idea of a perpetual, endemic anti-semitism is as ridiculous as the cranky right wing conspiracy theory about the US government being a Zionist Government of Occupation.
