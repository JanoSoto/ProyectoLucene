Unfortunately, the beloved owners of the camp (Jerry Stiller and Anne Meara) sell the place to a fitness guru who is more than a little obsessed, seeing as how he once weighed 300 pounds but is now normal weight.  New, tough counselors are brought in (Pat is reassigned within the camp and replaced with a man who talks like Arnold Schwarzenegger but is not nearly as good an actor).  The candy must go, of course.  The boys' lives are made miserable, and it gets worse when they can't meet their weight loss goals. Another problem  competitions with the other boys' camp, including an exciting one at movie's end.

As they devise a way to get the car up to 88 MPH, Marty end up picking a fight with Biff's ancestor, and Doc falls in love.The plot works well, and part 3 is every bit as good a movie as the original (I thought the second was wholly lacking in the plot department until the final act), but this installment is decidedly less fun.  In fact, it would be difficult to categorize this in the action-comedy style of the first two.  Part of the reason is that there are fewer jokes this time around, but even the jokes we do get are overshadowed by the darkness of the plot.The first movie was a fun romp in the past as Marty discovered that his parents actually were typical teenagers in their day.  Yes, we had the death of Doc Brown, but when that happened at the beginning, we didn't have an emotional investment in him, and as the movie went on, we got the feeling that some way, somehow, things would turn out okay in the end.The second movie had a very dark middle portion, but the movie didn't remain there long enough for it to cast a shadow over the rest of the film.

But regarding adaptation to the screen  is ANY book ever completely (CAN any book be?) converted to the screen with 100% accuracy?  I'm sure upon its release, the filmed version of 'Gone With The Wind' similarly had its complaints from purists.  The opening narration of the storyline hooked me (maybe it was because of that milky\/sultry woman's voice).  The visualswere spectacular, and even the obvious computer effects - which usually irritate me for their unnatural fluidity - didn't bother me too much. However, I did tend to roll my eyes somewhat at those ape-like Orcs (or goblins or whatever they were -- how stereotypically-acted, and that dumb make-up!).  The art-direction was phenomenal (I even found it in my heart to excuse the at-times look of Thomas Kinkade paintings); the cinematography and the gorgeous New Zealand scenics all combined into a world that I enjoyed giving myself over to.  (I never knew that New Zealand was *SO* beautiful!!  What a great advertisement this film makes for the director's homeland!)Before watching the movie (on DVD), I first watched all the behind the scenes 'extras.'  While watching all that, I thought to myself, Aren't hobbits supposed to be short?  (I saw actors of essentially the same height on the set.)  Then I started the movie and was surprised to see that, indeed, the filmmakers somehow managed to make all those hobbits all squished-down looking (with cute chubby faces).  Amazing.

","genre":"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"},{"date":"21 January 2003","score":"","review":"  Here's a point of view from someone who is bored by the 'fantasy' (and 'sci fi') genre  I really can't stand all those wizard\/princess\/Star Trek\/SciFi\/actors-in-too-much make-up movies.  So here's the bottom line that *I* liked this movie makes it a triumphant success!I read half of 'The Hobbit' literally decades ago, but stopped there; I never read the further LotR trilogy. Therefore, I cannot make an 'expert' (and nit-picky) review of what's been done to the story, as some have done here.  But regarding adaptation to the screen  is ANY book ever completely (CAN any book be?) converted to the screen with 100% accuracy?  I'm sure upon its release, the filmed version of 'Gone With The Wind' similarly had its complaints from purists.  The opening narration of the storyline hooked me (maybe it was because of that milky\/sultry woman's voice).  The visualswere spectacular, and even the obvious computer effects - which usually irritate me for their unnatural fluidity - didn't bother me too much. However, I did tend to roll my eyes somewhat at those ape-like Orcs (or goblins or whatever they were -- how stereotypically-acted, and that dumb make-up!).  The art-direction was phenomenal (I even found it in my heart to excuse the at-times look of Thomas Kinkade paintings); the cinematography and the gorgeous New Zealand scenics all combined into a world that I enjoyed giving myself over to.  (I never knew that New Zealand was *SO* beautiful!!  What a great advertisement this film makes for the director's homeland!)Before watching the movie (on DVD), I first watched all the behind the scenes 'extras.'  While watching all that, I thought to myself, Aren't hobbits supposed to be short?  (I saw actors of essentially the same height on the set.)  Then I started the movie and was surprised to see that, indeed, the filmmakers somehow managed to make all those hobbits all squished-down looking (with cute chubby faces).  Amazing.  As far as acting goes, I really don't think any actor (the men of the Fellowship) was much challenged, so no one much impressed me EXCEPT Ian McKellan and Peter Cushing and Ian Holm (who also recently impressed me in From Hell).  All three of these were fantastic; really, the only performances that I didn't think were walked-thru.Yes, the ending left me feeling as if suffering an interrupted interlude with my girlfriend (that is, unfinished) and wanting more.  But I know that I'll see my girlfriend again (when the other two movies are released, and I'll finally claim my relief).  I can excuse the abrupt ending because I went into this knowing that there are three films; aren't 'the movies' a business, after all?  They have every right to want us to return for the rest of their product.And a final note regarding director Peter Jackson  wotta guy!  I was shocked to see (here on IMDb) that he's made so few movies.  To be entrusted with such an undertaking as this really says something (either about him and\/or the studio\/producers).  Maybe the studio executives, like myself, have been impressed with his abilities on those few movies he's made. Myself, I've liked this guy's style since seeing my first Peter Jackson flick  'Heavenly Creatures.'  I look forward to much more from him.

Becoming a dreamy idol of lust for young women across the world in such a short time must be tough.  I'm guessing it was PEARL HARBOR that sealed the deal.  Affleck is beginning to show his age, and with young chiseled Hartnett standing beside him, the girls in the audience found a terrific relief pitcher.  Going from one Bruckheimer film to the next (BLACK HAWK DOWN) made me wonder if young Josh was already solidifying himself as an action star.  Guess I assumed too much.  In 40 DAY AND 40 NIGHTS, Hartnett plays the humble Matt Sullivan. A devoted boyfriend to a woman he's romantically dedicated his mind to.  The film opens with a montage of home movie footage showing Matt and Nicole (played by Vinessa Shaw) in what appears to be some happy and loving moments.  These precious memories were filmed by Matt's roommate Ryan, played by ROAD TRIP's Paulo Costanzo.  But we quickly learn that Matt and Nicole are no more, and our hero is doing his best to move forward sexually, only without the best results.  As Matt continues to accompany Ryan on chick hunts night after night, he comes to the realization that Nicole has ruined him for other women.  Sex doesn't work anymore, and he has constant nightmares to remind him of what's happened.  Things get worse when he finds out Nicole is now engaged to someone else.  After consulting with his priestly brother John, played by Adam Trese, Matt has an epiphany.  He decides to give up sex and any type of sexual conduct for 40 days and 40 nights.  His brother warns him of the difficulty and actually tries to dissuade Matt from the attempt.  Despite the odds, our hero begins his valiant mission, and at first things look rather good.  His friends at work soon catch wind of what's going on, and even start a betting pool on when Matt will falter.  His boss, played by a semi-manic Griffin Dunne, finds the act to be somewhat inspiring.  Unfortunately for Matt, it isn't long before EVERYONE finds out what's going on, thanks to his untrustworthy friends. To make things more difficult, a casual night at the local Laundromat leads to a romantic meeting with a beautiful girl named Erica, played by Shannyn (A KNIGHT'S TALE) Sossomon.  Matt falls madly in love with her, making his mission next to impossible.  She also falls madly in love with him, and can't understand why he refuses to get close.  Erica's roommate Samantha is concerned that she'll wind up hurt in similar fashion to her previous relationships.  Problems build as all of Matt's co-workers begin taking highly unfair steps to try and thwart his objective, and his former love tries to rekindle their now dead relationship.  Can Matt make it?  Will he find true love in the process?  Will someone give me a break?40 DAYS AND 40 NIGHTS isn't a bad movie, but we've seen this kind of thing before.  Hartnett plays the earnest hero in appropriate form, but exhibits one major flaw.  His emotions seem unaffected for the most part.  Oh sure, he frets and sweats and even gives us that shocked look time after time when he's tested.  But in the face of his supposed friends and their cruel attempts to screw him up, he does nothing.  No shouting, no angry looks, not even a single punch.  There lies the biggest problem.  The film has no payoff for the characters that deserve it.  We wait for it, but it never comes.  The humor, which is mature humor, works fairly well.  There are several moments of uproarious laughter, but most come with a that's so wrong mentality.  Most audiences might expect this to be a chick flick, and to some extent it is.  Surprisingly enough, there are PLENTY of hot women, bare boobs, and guy humor to make the unwilling boyfriends a bit more comfortable in the theater.  One scene involving a copier is worth the ticket alone.  The movie is funny, though not consistently enough. Hartnett proves his comedic ability, which is good, as he'll most likely get a wider range of scripts offered to him after this.  Director Michael Lehmann, who's helmed everything from HEATHERS to HUDSON HAWK, shows a subtle comedic touch here.  There are no over the top camera shots, and no need for there to be. Sossamon has a sexy yet demure look to her, which must be her obvious appeal.  She's that cool chick we all know, and wouldn't mind getting to know better.  Paulo Costanzo seemed underplayed for some reason, never really doing the funny things we'd expect him to in this role.  Vinessa Shaw is sexy and manipulative as Nicole, providing the antagonist character nicely, but like many of the characters in this flick does not get what she deserves.  Perhaps this was the film's way of saying real life isn't always fair, but you should still do the right thing.  Good guys must endure, in order for the rewards to feel deserved.  Either that or I'm just too darn old to get it.On a scale of ONE to TEN, 10 being the best, I give 40 DAYS AND 40 NIGHTS a 7.

Back when the movie came out, the set looked fine enough for kids to enjoy, but with today's technology some of it does look sort of cheesy and cheap.  Gene Wilder is perfectly cast as Willy Wonka, the holed up genius responsible for the factory's success.  Wonka has personality and charm, but also backbiting humor.  He is looking for an unselfish child to run his factory one day. He puts every winning ticket child to the test by inviting them to visit his factory so he can see their true character and motives.  He sees right through people's selfish motives and the accidents they cause in his factory are all the children's doings (or undoings).As a child, I didn't pay a lot of attention to the message of the oompa lumpahs and spoiled bratty kids.  I wasn't allowed to watch much TV and we didn't have much money so that's probably why I didn't think they were singing to me.  Adults will get the message and appreciate it.  A movie about good kids finishing first is always uplifting.  Many baby boomers and generation x-ers look fondly back on the movie and the effects the fantasy had on their childhood.  My boyfriend never saw the movie and I know he wouldn't enjoy it as an adult (he particularly loves car chase movies). It's a movie that's best seen for the first time as a child.

In this movie his ways prove no less unique.  This is not a great movie but it is a powerful statement on civil rights and the state of the country today.  Damon Wayans plays a TV executive who is hounded by a Vice President of the Network that fancies himself to be black.  Jada Pinkett plays Wayans' secretary. Michael Rapaport plays the Vice President excellently.  It is hard to say why this movie is so good.  The plot is unbelievable.  While the movie suffers a little bit from perhaps taking on too much the movie explores some deep issues.  Delacroix is the name of Wayans' character.  He comes up with what is a modern day minstrel show to broadcast on TV.  He intends it as a wake up call, but it ends up going completely out of control.I will not give away the rest of the plot.  The movie makes many statements about the way America views minorities, women, television and so forth.  While there are many pointed criticisms of the way America treats minorities there are many more of the television industry in general.  Tommy Davidson and Savion Glover have good roles in the movie. Davidson who is known mostly as a comedian turns in an excellent dramatic performance here.  Glover who is known as a dancer does a great dramatic job as well as an acting job.What amazed me about this movie are the scenes with the show.  Those are quite intense.  What is even more amazing is that a group of Americans were looked at in that negative of a light.  I think part of Lee's message is that perhaps minorities are still looked at in such a negative light.  When you look at the very end, you will see some amazing things about our society.  Michael Rapaport's character is great.  HE is one of the standouts in this movie.Also my hat is off to veteran Paul Mooney who plays a small part as Pierre's father.  He adds a lot of class to this movie.  But the movie says so much about race as well.  There are so many different kinds of characters in this movie, all of which represent some different aspect of America and how minorities strive and survive in a world that is not made for them, according to Spike Lee.  Perhaps he is right, but Lee has an excellent style of making films, and this one like almost all his others is very very good.  This is a disturbing and great film.  In relation to Spike Lee's other works this is not as good, but this is still excellentMos Def is very good as well in this part. He proves himself to be a very good actor.  The finale is such an odd but appropriate ending.  The New York flavor that is in Lee's movies is also very good.  When I saw this movie all the people in the movie were carrying on and I couldn't hear what the movie was saying.  The movie disturbed them so much in some parts they said nothing.  The part where that happened the most was during the commercials with &#145;Da Bomb' and &#145;Tommy Hilnigger.'  Perhaps Spike Lee is telling everyone to wake up in this movie as he often does.  This is an interesting view of the world, but like all of Spike Lee this movie is not for all tastes.

What can you do but laugh. They're American, I guess everything with an intrusive R sounds English to them.

But this film left me disappointed. Let me just comment a few things1) Johnnys accent. On the dvd version, the directors gave compliments to the fact that he was able to switch from Irish to Cockney to posh English, and they were so impressed that they didn't think he needed much coaching. What can you do but laugh. They're American, I guess everything with an intrusive R sounds English to them. Let the specialists be the judge of whether Johnny's accent was British or not, and let him get the help he really needs. I'm a native Swede, and I thought it was was terrible. And that says a lot. (I especially hated his mock Sean Connery thing, pronouncing s as sh.)2) London in the 1800s was dirty and smelly. Why are the streets so clean, and especially why is Heather so squeaky clean? And another comment Heather's character is so obviously much more pretty than the other prostitutes. This could be credible, if only someone would have commented upon it. At least her friends should have teased her about it  or something. Or she would be making more money than the others. It doesn't make sense.3) Johnny is supposed to be investigating a murder. I understand that the methods are much more refined today, but come on... Most of the time he just wanders around looking sad, alternatively surprised.4) When I heard the directors' comments on the film, I lost whatever respect I may have had for them. Laughing, one of them said he'd cast one of the girls because she had such darn sexy collarbones. Duh. And all of you looking for nudity on the dvd version, one scene which was cut out can be seen, where a very well shaped and beautiful female body lowers herself into a bath. I agree, she looks terrific. So why was she cut out? The answer is obvious. She was only there as a decoration, had nothing to do with the film, and I found that fact a bit offensive.

But past that point, the movie drifts off, fixating on Mark Borchardt's family life, which isn't very interesting.  Hell, neither is my family life, but you don't see me releasing my home videos for the whole viewing public to see.  Borchardt's rantings are often funny (sometimes you're laughing with him, other times at him), but sometimes they get annoying.  I would compare Mark to Ed Wood in his perseverance, but other than that (and the fact that both their films are beyond terrible) they're quite different.  Mark is very paranoid, and if he doesn't get the shot the way he likes it, he throws a fit.  Ed was very confident and if the first take would turn out halfway decent, he'd yell Cut and print!  I mean, if you're gonna be a bad filmmaker, act like a bad filmmaker.  Don't pretend like you're Stanley Kubrick.  But those are my criticisms about Mark, and not the movie.  The movie isn't bad, but the first 45 minutes are the best and the rest is pretty much downhill.  I don't care about Mark passing out on the couch watching the Oscars or watching the Green Bay Packers play on television while he sips beer like no tomorrow.  In a way, documentaries are good, because they hold a mirror up to reality, and we don't see enough reality in mainstream film.  But reality isn't always interesting.  If you want to see a consistently interesting documentary, watch Roger and Me, which contains a wide variety of characters who are each quirky and amusing in their own ways.  All I really cared about was Mark's pursuit in making the great American movie, no matter how far from great it really is.  So if the movie concentrated on that, and the running time was trimmed, I would've found it much more fascinating.

Sadness and tragedy are in the air right from beginning, you can feel them all the time, even when things start getting better for the two protagonists you know it can't last...because they are doomed, losers, not meant to be happy together. And yet the love they share is the purest and most devoting love I have ever seen on screen; it stunned me how true Jude was to Sue, and how brave Sue was, accepting Jude jr. as one of her own, no questions asked. Many people might find the scene of Sue giving birth and being watched by Jude jr. disturbing, yet it is essential to understand his later deeds, at least partly. The climax of the tragedy is so emotional and so immensely cruel it rips your heart out. I felt the theatre was falling into pieces and so were we, watching this emotional tornado, weeping like possessed. The experience of this movie will make you ponder life, love and death, it will make you understand how important it is to teach your children well and never make them feel undesired. It will make you realize how important it is to always think twice before commiting yourself, even in the modern world flooded with divorces.

Watch Stallone's body language at the beginning of the film when he meets the wife of his former team member. His pain is intense.  Rambo's final speech in the police station is probably Stallone's best single scene in any of his films.  Listen to what he says.
