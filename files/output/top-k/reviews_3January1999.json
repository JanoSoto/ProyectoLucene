[{"date":"3 January 1999","score":"","review":"  Elizabeth, the story of the first stormy years of Elizabeth I's ultimately gloriously successful reign, is a masterpiece.  Without being too untrue to the period, it manages beauty, suspense and great dialogue.  Cate Blanchett is Elizabeth in a way that few actors manage to portray real people.  I was overwhelmed by the richness of the values and the intelligence and complexity of the story.  This is a movie for adults - go and see it right away.

Maybe I should just buy myself a copy. It's among my top five movies of all time and perhaps my favorite Shakespeare adaptation.  It's stunning, brilliant, and beautiful. If you like your Shakespeare with every forsooth and thee and thou spoken by actors poncing around in doublets, you'll want to avoid it.  If you're a bit more daring, rent it.  For the unbelievably gorgeous costumes and sets.  For the modern fascist spin that gives the whole thing disturbing contemporary relevance.  But most of all for the performances--from McKellan's mesmerizing turn as Richard to Nigel Hawthorne's sweet and simple Duke of Clarence.  Even the smaller roles are perfectly cast. I enjoyed Adrian Dunbar's sadistic assassin, Domenic West's dashing Richmond, and Robert Downey Jr. as the playboy Earl Rivers.  Annette Bening, I must say, is terrible as Queen Elizabeth.  Completely unconvincing down to her wandering pseudo-aristocratic accent.  I keep imagining her betters tittering with embarrassment every time the lesser-light Bening exited the stage.  A minor flaw, however, in a stunning movie.  Rent it.  Again and again!
