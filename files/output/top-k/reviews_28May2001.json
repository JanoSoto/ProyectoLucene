If you liked the off-kilter humor of The Princess Bride, then this is the movie for you.Shrek takes place in the mythical kingdom of Duloc, ruled over by the evil, vertically-challenged Prince Farquaad (John Lithgow).  Farquaad wants to build the perfect kingdom, but to do that he thinks he has to root out all of the fairy-tale creatures who inhabit his land.  Where do they go? Into the swamp, which just happens to be the home of a curmudgeonly ogre named Shrek (Mike Myers).  Joined by Donkey (Eddie Murphy), the poster boy--er, equine--for logorrhea, Shrek makes the journey to Farquaad's castle.  (This scene alone--Farquaad's castle bears an uncanny resemblance to a certain Happiest Place On Earth, complete with turnstiles and You Are Parked Here signs--had me reduced to helpless guffaws.)  Shrek is sent on a quest to rescue damsel in distress Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) and return with her so that she can marry Farquaad.  But Shrek doesn't count on falling in love himself.  Fiona, in turn, has her own secrets.Shrek has a few things to say about inner versus outer beauty, and unlike the Disney fables Beauty and the Beast and Hunchback of Notre Dame, actually has the courage to see it through to its logical conclusion.  But that's just one of the things I liked about it.  It also has a strong message of self-determination, as Fiona goes from behaving the way she thought women should behave (pliant, weak-willed and subservient) to learning that her life should be lived on her own terms.  I also loved an hysterically funny torture(!) scene involving Farquaad and the Gingerbread Man, as well as Shrek's reaction to the fairy-tale creatures invading his home (upon seeing Snow White in her glass-covered bier, he shouts, No, no! Dead girl off the table!).  And a forest duet between Fiona and a bluebird cracked me up.  Even the de rigueur toilet humor elicited a chuckle or two.Now, I do have some minor quibbles with the animation   objects sometimes seemed to float above the background, especially objects moving away from the camera.  There also seemed to be a little disconnect between a person handling an object and the object itself.  However, these are minor complaints compared to the lush detail crammed into every frame, the beautiful colors that pop out at you, and the overall supple and fluid movement of every leaf on every tree.And so, to sum up this too-long review  Shrek marks DreamWorks' coming of age as an animation studio, as well as being flat-out funny.

For one and a half long hours you rub your eyes, not quite believing what you're seeing. It's amazing somehow, but you never quite believe it. Maybe that's not the best comparison, but can you tell me an event which makes you as speechless as such a movie?To call it a movie seems to be wrong anyway. It's a 90-minutes crazy, absolute over-the-top Rodman-thing with no sense at all.Usually I start with the story, but how could I do so with the total lack of one here? It pretends to be about some villain getting some kind of disc for some kind of weapon and to say this is more than you get from the film. Rodman plays a agent for Interpol it is said, although I'm not quite sure these are Interpol's working methods. Let's get this straight. Rodman is an agent in a french town with two monks as companions. They all live in a cellar under a church and have more crime to fight than the CIA in the whole US. Their gadgets include a CGI-fly, which can be directed in any direction and delivers an excellent view, a super-motorcycle which can drive up walls and ceilings and a lot of weapons.The two monks are obviously insane, as they sing and dance and laugh all the time very madly. One is fat, the other black. Your turn to make something of this.Rodman's other companion is another lunatic named Nick. He appears suddenly and stays without reason or explanation. Even more unreasonable is that Rodman lets him stay. Looking at this guy talking and 'acting' (sorry, but I got no other word for it), makes you wonder if there was a director who actually filmed him. In his first 10 minutes of screen time he impersonates three animals so unconvincingly and hilariously, that it's hard enough for itself. But seeing him 'doing the raptor' for about 30 seconds is just painful.There is also a woman which half of the movie fights against Rodman and the rest fights and sleeps with him at the same time. Where she comes from and who she remains a mystery.We also have a villain, so mad, it would be an understatement to call him a caricature. He always smiles, makes little jokes only he laughs about and gets scared the first time when his car is blocked by a sheep's herd. And he has maybe the first computer ever, which has not only a little animation looking like him, but this one can also talk for itself and change visually in order of the things happening around it. When the villain gets electrocuted, the animation gets to. Amazing.Which leaves us with a bunch of actors who laugh, dance and make crazy noises all the time, no story and the most unrealistic action sequences since Moses went through the Red Sea. Rodman lets himself fall down a long column, while he holds himself onto it with his legs, because he needs his arms for shooting. As I said, he also drives with his motorcycle up a wall and along the ceiling in a tunnel. And I can't forget the most hilarious sex-scene ever filmed, involving Rodman and his girlfriend\/enemy, a strobo-light and a see-through bed.Movies like this leave me kind of exhausted. I'm a fan of bad movies, but bad movies are only enjoyable if they take themselves seriously. Simon Sez tries to be both a comedy and an action-flick and fails desperately at both. The classic bad movie Double Team was funny because van Damme was so damn serious all the time (not to mention Mickey Rourke). Rodman playing crazy was just an addition to the serious stuff and made this film perfectly bad. But here everybody just plays crazy. It's Batman & Robin mixed with Double Team on drugs. And when you succeed in watching the movie in full length without running away, you can be sure to feel as crazy as the whole crew must have felt to make this film. So, in a way you're get in contact with the filmmaker's emotions. There are just aren't enough emotional movies out there. Here's a new one. Who wants to cry anyway when you just as well can become crazy?

For one and a half long hours you rub your eyes, not quite believing what you're seeing. It's amazing somehow, but you never quite believe it. Maybe that's not the best comparison, but can you tell me an event which makes you as speechless as such a movie?To call it a movie seems to be wrong anyway. It's a 90-minutes crazy, absolute over-the-top Rodman-thing with no sense at all.Usually I start with the story, but how could I do so with the total lack of one here? It pretends to be about some villain getting some kind of disc for some kind of weapon and to say this is more than you get from the film. Rodman plays a agent for Interpol it is said, although I'm not quite sure these are Interpol's working methods. Let's get this straight. Rodman is an agent in a french town with two monks as companions. They all live in a cellar under a church and have more crime to fight than the CIA in the whole US. Their gadgets include a CGI-fly, which can be directed in any direction and delivers an excellent view, a super-motorcycle which can drive up walls and ceilings and a lot of weapons.The two monks are obviously insane, as they sing and dance and laugh all the time very madly. One is fat, the other black. Your turn to make something of this.Rodman's other companion is another lunatic named Nick. He appears suddenly and stays without reason or explanation. Even more unreasonable is that Rodman lets him stay. Looking at this guy talking and 'acting' (sorry, but I got no other word for it), makes you wonder if there was a director who actually filmed him. In his first 10 minutes of screen time he impersonates three animals so unconvincingly and hilariously, that it's hard enough for itself. But seeing him 'doing the raptor' for about 30 seconds is just painful.There is also a woman which half of the movie fights against Rodman and the rest fights and sleeps with him at the same time. Where she comes from and who she remains a mystery.We also have a villain, so mad, it would be an understatement to call him a caricature. He always smiles, makes little jokes only he laughs about and gets scared the first time when his car is blocked by a sheep's herd. And he has maybe the first computer ever, which has not only a little animation looking like him, but this one can also talk for itself and change visually in order of the things happening around it. When the villain gets electrocuted, the animation gets to. Amazing.Which leaves us with a bunch of actors who laugh, dance and make crazy noises all the time, no story and the most unrealistic action sequences since Moses went through the Red Sea. Rodman lets himself fall down a long column, while he holds himself onto it with his legs, because he needs his arms for shooting. As I said, he also drives with his motorcycle up a wall and along the ceiling in a tunnel. And I can't forget the most hilarious sex-scene ever filmed, involving Rodman and his girlfriend\/enemy, a strobo-light and a see-through bed.Movies like this leave me kind of exhausted.

One of the two gets shot down, he's believe to be dead, yadda yadda yadda, something something, they do it in some hanging parachutes and then... the real reason we paid what we did to see this flick the attack.You know, you gotta tip your hat to the Japanese military when you realize the sheer scope of the attack (hundreds of planes - broken up between high-altitude bombers, fighters and torpedo planes) and the damage they wrought (2,000-plus dead and more than a dozen ships hit in less than 2 hours).The entire attack - more than 30 minutes long but it seems like 10 minutes - is amazing. A few critics said the fx was worse than those seen on Titanic - I disagree. The aerial combat was breathtaking. The bombing and raking of Americans in the water was done extremely well. I found myself ducking from the bullets spat from the diving Zeros, much like I did during the opening of Saving Private Ryan. And some of my favorite war footage didn't occur over the skies of Hawaii, but rather over Britain, when British and the American Eagle Squadron jumped from lumbering Nazi bombers near the British coast. Great footage - puts anything seen in Memphis Belle to shame in a hurry.OK, there were some cheesy points two American fighters manage - ala Star Wars - to out-fly, out-gun and out-fx 7 Japanese Zeros, which of course was great to watch but totally bogus in real life. Sorry, when the odds in aerial combat are 3-1, the 1 will lose everytime. But that scene was balanced with Cuba Gooding's shootdown from the deck of a stricken ship of a diving torpedo bomber - great effects.Once the battle is completed, there is somewhat of a letdown, and it seems too long of a pause from when the bombs finish dropping over Oahu and when Doolittle's bombers drop American bombs on Tokyo. Still, this raid has seldom been touched by Hollywood, and it was refreshing to see.My favorite scenes from the whole movie were, of course, the ones shown on the previews months ago - tiny snippets of Americana throughout the Hawaiian Islands rudely brought up cold by these menacing - and yet beautiful - Japanese planes. A woman with wet clothes from a clothesline; boy scouts on a tromp through the hills; a baseball game.

We get clues that there was a murder in 1970 at the same hotel, and later that something similar must have happened around 1921 with the strange coincidence that the top dog of the hotel back then looked like Nicholson.  We also have a series of strange hallucinations seen thru the eyes of Shelley Duvall's character that lead us to believe the place has been haunted for awhile.  This type of uncertainty seems to prevail in many of Kubrick's movies so I guess I should have expected this, but it seems that more information(possibly in  King's novel) should have been included.  But as a scary movie, with a knockout performance by Nicholson, as well as most everyone involved,  there ain't too many pictures of this type that beat this.  Sometimes the way to determine whether a scary movie does it's job is if you don't want to watch the movie again -- which happened to me, so I guess Kubrick did what he intended.

Does that excuse it from being mean-spirited? boring? ugly? anti-female? aimless? incomprehensible? unentertaining?The first scene has our two heroes hitching a ride in a red cadillac convertible.  Because of all the drugs in their system, they hallucinate being attack by bats.  The scene went on and on with no pay-off.  Well, that scene didn't work, I thought to myself.  And it went on from there.  Like grown up children, these two bums feel they can get away with everything, from harrassing\/threatening every female they meet to destoying their hotel room.It's just another one of those movies where the central character is really cool and everyone else is a jerk.  Much like any Robin Williams flick.I almost could excuse this mess...IF IT WAS FUNNY!!!!  BUT IT'S NOT!!!Every scene is the same.  Duke and Gonzo appear on the scene (no matter where) and either insult or injure the people there.  And it goes on and on and on like that.There's a short scene in the desert between Duke and a highway patrolman played by Gary Busey.  You can almost imagine Gilliam thinking, Now how can we make this cop look like an ass AND get a laugh?  Of course, he'll ask Duke if he can kiss him.  Haw HawIt doesn't work.

From the reviews I've read, they make it sound like Pearl Harbor is the worst movie this side of `Dude, Where's My Car?' It's not going to win `Best Picture,' but it's entertaining nonetheless.There are several things that prevent this movie from being great. It's filled with cheesy lines (`I think World War II just started!') and pseudo-inspirational quotes (`I'm not anxious to day, sir, just anxious to matter.'). The worst thing about this film is probably the transition between the Ben-Kate-Josh love triangle and the Japanese and Military Officials. It often felt like I was watching two different and unrelated movies.The best thing about this movie is probably the superior special effects once the attack starts. The first half of the film is slow at times and I wondered when the bombing was going to start, but at the same time that sort of helped illustrate how unexpected the attack was and how unprepared the Navy was. Once it starts, you get a real sense what it was like and how devastating the attack on Pearl Harbor was.As for the cast, there's not shortage of attractive young people. Most of the secondary characters are an interesting and funny supporting cast. I have seen Ben Affleck act better, and his character Rafe is rather cardboard, but Josh Hartnett plays the younger and less confident Danny very well and gives him a little depth. Kate Beckinsale manages to rise above her limited material, and shows promise for future roles. *Warning Female Gushing Ahead!* I find it funny that when you look at the voter breakdown, Females rated this film an average of two stars higher than males. You may ask why, and the reason is Josh Hartnett. This guy is a good actor, not to mention gorgeous and super sexy, and I came out of the theater thinking, `I must see every Josh Hartnett movie EVER.' (Which is like 3). Ladies, you will not be disappointed if you see this movie. *End Female Gushing!*It will probably have to settle for a couple MTV Movie Awards nominations, but it will entertain you. I've seen my share of bad movies, and this isn't a bad movie. Like most movie, you can't read too much into it. Just sit back, don't scoff too much at the cheesy lines and enjoy the eye candy. I give it 7 out of 10  ","genre":null},{"date":"28 May 2001","score":"","review":"  The first thing I have to say is this movie isn't as bleak as all the `respected' critics make it sound.

It is directed skillfully, full of eye candy to watch and substance galore.  Many cuts were made to fit the vision and most of them work. This movie is moody, to say the least.  So the cuts are wise.  A four hour version of this movie would have been overweighed with mood.  The acting, for the most part is sublime.  Sam Shepard, Liev Schriber and Bill Murray score serious points.  Diane Venora lends her talents to another complicated and much debated Shakespearean woman (see her Lady Capulet in Baz's ROMEO AND JULIET....she is very enjoyable.)  Ethan Hawke plays his part with gusto and scores for the most part, with heavy emphasis on the melancholy part of the dane. Many transpositions work well.  Setting in Hotel Elsinore and making everything big business really fits well.  The commonly viewed theme of Ophelia as a pawn come into frutition well in the get thee to a nunnery scene by using Ophelia as planted agent tapped and wired.Some falling point in this movie lie in several moments.  Many of the cuts leave much needed dialouge missing.  In the aforementioned nunnery scene Hamlet, in a full-text version, really shows his tempestuous side letting Ophelia have it with all four barrels.  In this version, you are never sure, at first, if he is castigating or seducing her. Julia Stiles attempts Ophelia well but comes up lacking.  Much of her dialogue had been cut and was left to give mournful glances and forced to play love torn.  The to be or not to be speech works to a point, but never reaches quite the effect that it could.  That speech should pull Hamlet in every direction.  He is contemplating suicide and decides that his mind will not decide.  So Hamlet reasons not to kill himself at that moment. That much needed motivation is missing in this movie.  I believe Ethan Hawke's Hamlet could kill himself at any moment and the ground would not shake much. As a whole, the film works, beautifully filmed and visually stunning.
