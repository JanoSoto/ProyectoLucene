There, if you go up to someone and say you're killin' me Smalls! or call someone an L 7 WEENIE, and tell someone that it will take FOR-E-VER, the person will more than likely start laughing and know exactly what you're talking about.  It's one of the movies that I, and many other teenagers in my school, will never forget. Its one of the best parts of our childhood.  However, I feel as though if you did not grow up with this movie, you will never truely appreciate it for it's greatness.  Basically, they just dont make movies like this anyone. Pure classic.
