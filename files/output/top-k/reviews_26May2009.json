[{"date":"26 May 2009","score":"10 out of 11 people found the following review useful","review":" Having to compete with Disney, Dreamworks and Pixar, Warner Brother's animation has never been at the forefront of the animation industry. Apparently all they needed was the brilliant Brad Bird to quell any doubt about their capabilities. The Iron Giant is one of the final films to be presented in the traditional animation form, but even this flick had begun the transition to computer generated visuals. A number of characters, including the giant, were inserted digitally over the hand drawn background, taking special care to perform this imperfectly so as to contrast the rougher backdrop. The finished piece is a visually flawless and captivating film and ranks among the best animated features to ever grace the screen.Brad Bird who began with significant role in The Simpson's cartoon, marks his feature film debut, and would follow up with the even superior films The Incredibles and Ratatouille. The Iron Giant is part political statement, part satire and part family fare, but contains more substance then most children's films, containing passionate and is reminiscent of classics such as ET and The Lion King. Based on the book by Ted Hughes, the tale tells of a young boy in Rockwell, Maine named Hogarth Hughes voiced by unknown Eli Marienthal who, if you must put a face to the voice played Stiffler's younger brother in American Pie, in Cold War era 1958. His mother voiced by Jennifer Aniston, works late shifts at a local diner, his father has been killed (presumably in combat, as we see from a photograph he was a fighter pilot) and Hogarth who has been moved up a grade, finds himself lonely and misunderstood.On a stormy night, a mysterious object crashes off the coast, which to Hogarth's surprise (and everyone's for that matter) is a giant metal eating robot. Finding the creature to be as harmless and confused as a young boy, he befriends the behemoth, stashing him away in a local scrap yard, who the owner (voiced by Harry Connick Jr.) is not especially pleased about. After the giants shenanigans begin to be noticed, a federal agent, brilliantly voiced by Christopher McDonald, comes to investigate ands comes to suspect Hogarth may know something.The scenes where Hogarth attempts to hide the creature are the most hilarious, one sequence after the giant loses his hand (which can walk on its own once severed) our young protagonist attempts to sneak it out of the house. But don't be fooled, the iron Giant is less comedy then it is bold statement, but don't let this turn you off either.Bird's piece is riddled with political commentary on the Cold War and its effect on America and the society's obsession with warfare, weapons and at what cost freedom can be obtained, issues such as morality and death, and explores the human gift of free will, as both a blessing and as a means to do harm. The Giant, despite having every few lines is surprisingly layered and human, and has an innocence covering an inner evil turmoil. The message that you are who you chose to be is reminiscent throughout the whole film, but it never for a second feels preachy. The climax is a thrilling as any action picture, which I will say may be slightly too violent for younger children, and the closing act is as touching as any committed to celluloid.The Iron Giant is a dazzling tale and complex experience which is bound to keep you involved, entertained and will give you something to think about after leaving the theatre. Ranking as one of the best films of 1999, if The Iron Giant marks the end of the reign of the traditional animation style, I say that no finer adieu could be given in this world, or any, dare I say it, beyond this Earth.Read all my reviews at http\/\/www.simonsaysmovies.blogspot.com ","genre":null},{"date":"26 May 2009","score":"10 out of 11 people found the following review useful","review":" Having to compete with Disney, Dreamworks and Pixar, Warner Brother's animation has never been at the forefront of the animation industry.

But to my surprise and pleasure I found that I actually thoroughly enjoyed it.Christopher Lee, as promised, is excellent, aided by an intriguing script which enlists audience sympathies on his side in the pre-credit sequence before we are made aware of his identity, and which presents him as, frankly, rather more resourceful and in control than Roger Moore's Bond. The obligatory sequence in which the villain has Bond in his power but carelessly omits to kill him is given an interesting new twist by the revelations about Scaramanga's actual assassination intentions, and Lee's subsequent performance makes the final showdown psychologically credible.At this stage of Moore's tenure, his portrayal of Bond had yet to settle down to its later self-caricature, and in fact I found that the character is not depicted in this film as especially sympathetic this is effective as a lot of the humour here is at Bond's own expense. I can see that real Fleming aficionados might find this 'disrespectful' approach alienating, but as I had always found Moore's Bond rather annoying I have to say that I enjoyed watching his misadventures and the quips at his expense it was only with the re-approach of the smug action-hero element towards the end of the film that my tolerance began to fade.The women, I'm afraid, were rather a disappointment. Britt Ekland might have fared better as an exotic temptress but seemed wooden in the unrewarding role of the English-rose agent Mary Goodnight, although the plot does provide a plausible rationale for having her spend the entire last act running around in a bikini.

The English Patient contains very much of what made those films so powerful. It has that glorious feeling, a stretched running time that hardly seems long at all, and fascinating characters with pasts and stories.The English Patient, based on a novel by the same name by Michael Ondaatje, is like The Godfather Part II (1974) in the sense of how it's constructed. It's a blending of two stories the past and the present and it all revolves around the titular character an English patient in the post years of World War Two. Ralph Fiennes plays the English patient, who has been scarred for life by a plane crash, and being taken care of in an isolated church by a single nurse played marvelously by Juliette Binoche. Apart from bonding with her raspy-voiced, troubled patient, Binoche comes to learn about his past when a stranger (Willem Dafoe) arrives and the two men appear to know each other.That's just one of the two beautifully crafted stories that shape this film. The other one, told in flashback, is the patient's past, before he was scarred and dying in a bed. The story of the present mixed with the patient's past and his love affair that tragically changed his life forever.To be blunt, The English Patient is a love story blended with a sweeping epic sensation and it blends magnificently. What I really admired about the love story between Ralph Fiennes and Kristin Scott Thomas was how passionate, how obsessive, how enchanting it was shown on screen. Usually in love stories, such as Minghella's later Cold Mountain (2003), the romantic elements seem far more lustful than obsessive to me. Some of the love scenes feature elements that may tend to be associated more with lust than love, but still, because it is so well developed and not rushed and not exploited out of proportion, we can believe that there is a sure, true love between these characters. It reminded me a lot of Vertigo (1958) in how well the filmmakers and performers convinced us that these were two actual human beings who truly fell in love with each other.Performances all around were great. I was especially enthralled by the performance by Juliette Binoche, who took home the Oscar for her performance the following year. I also liked Willem Dafoe playing the sort of cynical, questionable character that he's always quintessential at playing. And of course I can't leave out Fiennes and Scott Thomas and their portrayals of two very passionate lovers.Despite my enormous enthusiasm for this epic, I would be dishonest if I were to describe it as a perfect film. There are two flaws that I cannot glance over. Number one, it is a little too long and the reason for this is my second complaint, there are a few unnecessary subplots. I was not enchanted or particularly interested with the second love story between Binoche and a bomb specialist played by Naveen Andrews. My research has led me to assume that this plot element comes from the original book and I'm sure it worked perfectly in there, but in the film, it just seems a little&#x85;distracting and the relationship between the two characters didn't fascinate me. I was far more interested by Fiennes character and his relationships with his two leading actresses.Nevertheless, these two flaws are easily forgivable even if they do slow things down a bit. Those put aside, The English Patient is an extraordinary achievement of film-making. To me, it was sort of like an insane mix up between Casablanca (1942) and Lawrence of Arabia (1962), two remarkable and better films, and this effective blend proved to be well worth my time.

I remember receiving this as a Christmas gift when I was around fourteen and I enjoyed then but wondered how well it might hold up now that I was older. The answer, surprisingly enough, was rather well.For one thing it has a good cast. Harrison Ford makes the potentially unbelievable role of President\/action hero seem believable. Ford handles the action sequences well and helps get the action hero side of the equation seem real. Ford then brings some acting talent forward as well as he comes across believably as the President of the united States in scenes like his introduction\/speech in Moscow towards the beginning of the film. Even more intriguing (and rare in a Hollywood action film) Ford plays the personal side of the action hero President just as well. In short Ford gives a believable and well-rounded performance.Gary Oldman makes a fantastic villain in the form of Ivan Korshunov. It can be easy for an actor to take a role like Ivan Korshunov and turn into a cliché part but not Oldman. Oldman's performance seems real and becomes a study in a fanatical terrorist. This is especially true in Oldman's performance when he first calls the Situation Room and when talking to the President's daughter. Oldman also handles the action sequences believably and there isn't a moment where he seems unbelievable. In short Oldman gives a fine performance in what could have been a cliché ridden role.The supporting cast is good too. Of particular mention is Glenn Close as the Vice President, Wendy Crewson and young Liesel Matthews as the First Family who (like Ford and Oldman) take potentially clichéd roles and make them into nice performances. Noted character actors including Paul Guilfoyle, Xander Berkeley, William H. Macy and Dean Stockwell all give good performances in their various roles. There's also a nice non-speaking, cameo like role for Jürgen Prochnow as General Radek. There's also some good performances from numerous other actors that help to fill out the world of the film.Air Force One is an action film and does well at it. From the opening commando raid to the takeover to the plane and beyond, the film features some well-choreographed sequences. Not to mention numerous fight scenes including the climatic and highly impressive fight between the film's two leads. The film also features some exciting if at times unbelievable aerial sequences as well though some of the CGI work is rather unconvincing (particualry in the ending). Otherwise it's as impressive as any action film out there if not better.The film also features good work behind the camera as well. It features rather convincing sets from Production Designer William Sandell which (more then anything else) help to sell the reality of the film. The camera work of Michael Ballhaus gives Air Force One much the same claustrophobic feel of director Wolfgang Peterson's 1981 classic Das Boot despite the plane being much bigger which, when coupled with the editing of Richard Francis-Bruce, gives the film the feeling of being both a claustrophobic thriller and an action film all in one. Last, but not least, the script by writer Andrew W. Marlowe is fairly good though it does feature some glaring plot holes yet it works for the most part.All together under the direction of Wolfgang Pterson the result is a movie considerably better then most of the stuff that Hollywood produces on a regular basis.One of the film's highlights is the score. Unhappy with the score originally created by prolific composer Randy Newman, director Peterson turned to one of the true masters of film score Jerry Goldsmith. What Goldsmith (with the assistance of Joel McNeely) is truly up to the standards of Goldsmith's previous cores. it is loud, epic, personal, epic and patriotic all in the film's two hour running time.

I remember receiving this as a Christmas gift when I was around fourteen and I enjoyed then but wondered how well it might hold up now that I was older. The answer, surprisingly enough, was rather well.For one thing it has a good cast. Harrison Ford makes the potentially unbelievable role of President\/action hero seem believable. Ford handles the action sequences well and helps get the action hero side of the equation seem real. Ford then brings some acting talent forward as well as he comes across believably as the President of the united States in scenes like his introduction\/speech in Moscow towards the beginning of the film. Even more intriguing (and rare in a Hollywood action film) Ford plays the personal side of the action hero President just as well. In short Ford gives a believable and well-rounded performance.Gary Oldman makes a fantastic villain in the form of Ivan Korshunov. It can be easy for an actor to take a role like Ivan Korshunov and turn into a cliché part but not Oldman. Oldman's performance seems real and becomes a study in a fanatical terrorist. This is especially true in Oldman's performance when he first calls the Situation Room and when talking to the President's daughter. Oldman also handles the action sequences believably and there isn't a moment where he seems unbelievable. In short Oldman gives a fine performance in what could have been a cliché ridden role.The supporting cast is good too. Of particular mention is Glenn Close as the Vice President, Wendy Crewson and young Liesel Matthews as the First Family who (like Ford and Oldman) take potentially clichéd roles and make them into nice performances. Noted character actors including Paul Guilfoyle, Xander Berkeley, William H. Macy and Dean Stockwell all give good performances in their various roles. There's also a nice non-speaking, cameo like role for Jürgen Prochnow as General Radek. There's also some good performances from numerous other actors that help to fill out the world of the film.Air Force One is an action film and does well at it. From the opening commando raid to the takeover to the plane and beyond, the film features some well-choreographed sequences. Not to mention numerous fight scenes including the climatic and highly impressive fight between the film's two leads. The film also features some exciting if at times unbelievable aerial sequences as well though some of the CGI work is rather unconvincing (particualry in the ending). Otherwise it's as impressive as any action film out there if not better.The film also features good work behind the camera as well. It features rather convincing sets from Production Designer William Sandell which (more then anything else) help to sell the reality of the film. The camera work of Michael Ballhaus gives Air Force One much the same claustrophobic feel of director Wolfgang Peterson's 1981 classic Das Boot despite the plane being much bigger which, when coupled with the editing of Richard Francis-Bruce, gives the film the feeling of being both a claustrophobic thriller and an action film all in one. Last, but not least, the script by writer Andrew W. Marlowe is fairly good though it does feature some glaring plot holes yet it works for the most part.All together under the direction of Wolfgang Pterson the result is a movie considerably better then most of the stuff that Hollywood produces on a regular basis.One of the film's highlights is the score. Unhappy with the score originally created by prolific composer Randy Newman, director Peterson turned to one of the true masters of film score Jerry Goldsmith. What Goldsmith (with the assistance of Joel McNeely) is truly up to the standards of Goldsmith's previous cores. it is loud, epic, personal, epic and patriotic all in the film's two hour running time. Goldsmith was great at creating themes which were not only memorable but fitting and his main title theme for Air Force One remains one of the great examples of his talent. it might not be the greatest score of Goldsmith's long career but it is certainly one of his best.All in all Air Force One is better then a lot of Hollywood's other action films.

However, in the musical-murder tale, we have the typical Romeo and Juliet spin off. Maria (Natalie Wood) and Tony (Richard Beymer) are the star-crossed lovers in this tale -- she the sister of a Puerto Rican Shark, he a grudging member of the Jets. They don't come from wealthy, feuding families, but from racial groups deeply resentful of one another. The high point of the musical is the big love scene which plays out on a fire escape, outside Maria's room. For a first watch, this movie plays out exactly like Romeo and Juliet; two different parties having conflict with each other and then there are two individuals that fall in love with each other. However, these two love birds come from the conflicting parties. Highlights of the movie were the dances and songs. The acting between the main characters seemed to be realistic. It's a classic love story that will be remade in every which way. I didn't think that the costume choices were that great, the colors were too bold and bright for a movie that took place in New York City. Along with the actual clothing, the girls had dramatic frilly dresses and it seemed like all the girls did was sew dresses they would be wearing later that evening. The length of the movie was a bit lengthy as well. It turned out to be one of those movies you find yourself moving around in your chair to find some comfort. First time seeing this musical, I made perfect distinction as of who was on each side. They made the American gang dress in blue jeans and light colors with a jacket over it. The Puerto Rican side wore more on the darker colors, usually black or dark purple slacks and a dark solid color t-shirt to match with it. The accents from both sides fit well. The conflict between the two teams was perfect, the build up and dramatics weren't too much. I also liked the fact that they over exaggerated the characters, individually, making them seem like they were top dog in their environment.I'm not a musical fanatic, but West Side Story turned out to be a great watch and I think the fact it has parts from Romeo and Juliet will make it easier for audience members to watch and it'll keep them wondering, Oh, what's next? or  Let's see if things relate like they did in Romeo and Juliet.
