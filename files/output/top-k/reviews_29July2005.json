Sure, it has all the romantic comedy contrivances, and relies on a series of clichéd coincidences and well-worn shots of New York to get the audience to the satisfying ending. It by no means has re-invented the wheel here. Instead, it's just an above average wheel, one that you'll enjoy if you buy into the formula.The main reason why this film works where other romantic comedies fail is the cast. John Cusack proves there is no movie he can't class up by his presence, being the guy that women find attractive and smart, while guys identify with. He's the everyman for the hipster crowd. Cusack's Jonathan Trager is a funny, self-deprecating, engaging lead whose charisma carries the film. The gorgeous Kate Beckinsale plays Sara Thomas, the object of Trager's affection, being the cute, funny hot girl that would make a guy gladly jump through all the crazy hoops she places in front of him for a shot at her affections. They are both affable leads with solid chemistry that clicks well enough and fast enough that the audience becomes reasonably invested in their separate pursuits of each other through the rest of the movie (as they spend most of the movie apart from one another).Cusack's best friend Jeremy Piven plays the same best friend character he does in most of Cusack's movies, this time as Dean Kansky. As much chemistry as Cusack and Beckinsale manage in this movie, it can't help to match the chemistry Cusack and Piven have. It's their antics in the movie that cause Serendipity to rise above the otherwise average romantic comedy it should be, as they manage to be truly funny without resorting to the usual bumbling moron buddy tricks that lesser comedies fall back on. Adding to the mix is Eugene Levy, who steals every scene he's in as a Bloomington's Salesman who helps Trager and Kansky track down Sara.Another reason this movie stands out for me is that the respective significant others for Cusack and Beckinsale in the movie are both perfectly good people who care for their partners. Too often in movies like this one, the significant others that keep the main couple apart are portrayed as unlikeable people, the women are mousey shrews or controlling bitches, and the men are complete jerks. This is designed to make the audience cheer harder for the main couple to eventually get together. Unfortunately, it ends up making the main characters look stupid. Why would these people choose such beasts to be their girlfriend\/boyfriend\/fiancée? Are they that blind? Not so with Serendipity, where Bridget Moynahan brings a sweetness and genuine concern to Trager's fiancée Halley Buchanen and John Corbett does the same with Thomas' fiancée Lars Hammond. Corbett does a great comedic job with Hammond, a new age musician in the Yanni mold, who is a little weird and a little preoccupied with his career, but still a loving boyfriend. It's not that their other loves aren't good people, it's just that they're not the right people.I've watched this movie dozens of times now, and it only grows on me more each time. I still laugh out loud at many parts in the movie, and am always won over by the characters and the pursuit each time. In the hands of lesser performers, there's a good chance that it would be terrible. But it's not, it's simple and winning, even Molly Shannon is tolerable in it, playing a toned down version of the same character she always plays, this time as Sara's best friend Eve. If you're looking for a nice, warm romantic comedy, but aren't willing to accept the usual dumbed down offerings of the genre, than Serendipity is an excellent choice.

King of New York had the potential to be something great but in the end it only manages to frustrate you.The whole plot in itself is amazingly simple. I mean, where's the originality? A guy called Frank White (Cristopher Walken) gets out of prison, kills everybody just like that (I guess it's that easy, huh) and then he rules New York. Then some cops get angry with Frank because he's a criminal (that's the most deepest part in this movie, cops are supposed to be complex individuals...) and they decide to kill him. Then there's some shooting and more shooting and finally everybody's dead.A plot could actually be that simple if there was something extra in it - something interesting to spice things up - a great character, interesting details or ultimately anything to separate this film from the masses. Unfortunately King of New York doesn't have anything to offer in that area. They have obviously tried to deepen Walken's character but they fail miserably. In fact that's the case with all the other characters too. Walken's supposed to be this guy who cares about the poor but this is shown in what, two scenes? Same thing with the police, when they all get killed I don't feel anything because I haven't related to them. Furthermore the dialog is mediocre at best and you can't really call it original.The biggest problem of this movie is that it's not coherent at all. The scenes are in many occasions completely unattached to each other and the whole movie ends up being like a mess. The atmosphere in the film is good - Ferrara is able to depict the brutality and the overall mood well but otherwise the directing is just average. For example the opening scene is way too long. I'd understand it if the movie was an epic or a masterpiece but now it just seems completely irrelevant and tiring to spend at least five minutes following a guy who gets out of prison without dialog. Same thing with the final scene - it drags too long. I guess if you enjoyed the movie the final scene could work but for me after a messy 1,5 hours it just works as an icing in the cake what comes to frustration.I guess the main point I'm trying to say is that this movie had potential but it never delivered.

The film opens with a spaceship returning from exploration on Mars with a woman and a man with green slime on his arm. She, through some hokey plot contrivances, begins to tell what happened on this fateful trip as almost all the tapes seemed to be magnetically wiped off. Four astronauts take on this journey a military type played by Gerald Mohr, a poor man's Humphrey Bogart who enjoys saying the word Irish and has the acting savvy of a codfish, then there is Naura Hayden, a beautiful redhead and only female crew member on flight with three men wearing the most formfitting suits possible to accentuate all her curves, next, Les Tremaine, a wonderful character actor from cheap sci-fi films like this as the egghead, and last, Jack Kruschen as Sammy - the guy from Brooklyn with jokes and doesn't seem too bright although chosen for his expertise in electronics. None of these performers are really any good, and all of them say their dialog with little conviction. Watch Tremaine as he utters that scientific nonsense! Really, the best out of the four is Kruschen - and that really says a lot about this film. But bad acting aside, the movie just falls apart when they land on Mars via flashback. The Angry Red Planet had a real cheap budget because Mars is really the American Southwest with a heavy red tint over it. When the story calls for something that might look Martian, there are drawings placed with a heavy red tint over them. You can tell they are drawings The monsters are perhaps even worse as we get a Bat-rat-spider with a size upwards of 40 feet that looks like some kids got together piecing dead animals together. The other significant creature is a giant amoeba with an oscillating eye. Whew! These are bad. There is a nice drawing of a Martian city, but there just was not enough of this in the film. Despite all these big problems, The Angry Red Planet is a fun bad film. It is really fascinating to see how far we have come as a civilization. Most of the stuff they used in the movie is so outdated. One guy is using an electric razor with a cord and I thought they can get to Mars but they are still using cords.

Making the world's most expensive movie ever is always to tempt fate; the film which had previously held that distinction, the Kevin Costner vanity project Waterworld, had been a disaster in both financial and artistic terms. Even before Titanic was finished, rumours were circulating that it would be equally disastrous; the critics began preparing their sinking ship metaphors in anticipation of its failure.In the event, of course, the critics were confounded; the film was a great success, both at the box office and with the Academy, who awarded it eleven Oscars including best picture and best director. It became the most talked-about film of 1997. Eight years on there have been other films on a similar epic scale and some of the excitement it provoked has died away. Nevertheless, even today it stands out as a fine achievement.Titanic combines two quite different genres, the disaster movie and the heritage costume drama. The late nineties saw a modest revival of the disaster picture, that quintessentially seventies genre, with Twister in 1996 and Dante's Peak and Volcano the following year. Cameron took the basic formula for such films and applied it to a real historical event, making a film on a grand scale with lavish attention to period detail. The real Titanic sinking had a number of features which fitted the genre; it is something of a convention of disaster movies that the disaster should be caused, or at least exacerbated, by the incompetence or complacency of those in authority, an element emphasised here. Bruce Ismay, the Chairman of the White Star Line, proudly proclaims the ship unsinkable, then causes the disaster by urging the captain to steam at top speed through an ice-field. To make matters worse, the company have neglected to provide sufficient lifeboats for all on board.Cameron also imported into the film some of the conventions of heritage cinema. That genre has often been used to examine the British class system, often in films which feature romances between individuals from different social backgrounds, such as Losey's The Go-Between or Merchant-Ivory productions like Howard's End. Cameron takes the same concept and uses the film to examine the historical roots of the American class system, of which the ship, with its first, second and third class passengers, is a microcosm. Intertwined with the story of the tragedy is the story of the romance between Rose Dewitt Bukater, daughter of an aristocratic Philadelphia family, and Jack Dawson, a struggling artist from a working-class background.The America that we see is not, as is sometimes said, a classless society, nor even one where class is solely determined by wealth. The Dewitt Bukaters, for all their old-money pretensions, are in financial difficulties, and Rose's late father died heavily in debt. Rose's mother Ruth sees that the only way to maintain the family's social status will be if Rose makes a good marriage to a wealthy man, and a seemingly ideal candidate has presented himself in the shape of Cal Hockley, the son of a nouveau-riche industrialist. Unfortunately, Cal is an arrogant, selfish snob, and Rose cannot bear the thought of marriage to him. She considers suicide by throwing herself off the ship, but is dissuaded from doing so by Jack, and the two fall in love.Some have criticised the film for concentrating on the romance of Jack and Rose, arguing that this focus is somehow demeaning to a real-life tragedy in which over a thousand people died. This is not a criticism with which I would agree. It would clearly have been impossible to tell the personal stories of all those who died; Cameron's aim was to put the disaster into context and heighten its impact by giving us two characters we can care about and to make their story representative of the stories of all those caught up in the drama, thus heightening the film's emotional impact.The film has a number of weaknesses. The liberties taken with historical accuracy, such as the denigration of the character of William Murdoch (who in real life died bravely), can sometimes seem offensive. The opening scenes and closing, which deal with the attempts of a modern salvage team to recover from the wreck a valuable jewel given by Cal to Rose, were possibly unnecessary and certainly overlong, and could easily have been pruned. The acting is not always very good; I was less than impressed by Leonardo Di Caprio as Jack. (In fairness it must be said that he has greatly improved as an actor since 1997, having given a good performance in Catch Me If You Can and an excellent one in The Aviator). Kate Winslet as Rose was better, although even she fell short of the brilliance she had shown in Heavenly Creatures.The weaknesses are, however, greatly outweighed by the film's strengths. A special mention must go to James Horner's evocative score and Celine Dion's song My Heart Will Go On. There are a number of good performances in minor roles, from Kathy Bates as Molly Brown, shunned as vulgar by her fellow first-class passengers but more good-hearted than any of them, Bernard Hill as Captain Smith, a decent man but without the strength of character to stand up to Ismay's bullying, and Frances Fisher as Ruth, a woman who puts her social status ahead of her daughter's happiness. In the end, however, this is not a film one watches for the acting. I would agree with the reviewer who said that the real star is neither Kate nor Leo but rather the great ship itself, particularly during the spectacular scenes after it hits the iceberg. The success of Titanic gave Hollywood back the self-confidence to make pictures on a grand scale with daring, energy and imagination, leading to recent epics such as Gladiator and Troy. 8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"29 July 2005","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" It was brave of James Cameron to attempt an undertaking on this scale.

I was overwhelmed by the power of the performances, the staging of the scenes, the locations, and the power that the simple story had with such complex circumstances. Then I saw it again, and a third time, and I know that this is one of the best films ever to come out of Germany- it's a powerful statement about protecting our children (if you're looking at it as a message movie), but in reality it is just a piece of cinema heaven. Thrillers today only wish they could draw a viewer into the mystery elements, and have such unconventionality of the times. Boiling down to this, M is about a child Killer - the legendary character actor Peter Lorre in his first major role - who snatches children when their parents don't watch, and continues on until an investigation goes underway. But as the police investigate overly thoroughly into the real criminal underworld, they know something is up, that this is someone far more gone than they could ever be, so they join in the hunt. This all leads to one of the supreme dramatic climaxes in any thriller.On the first viewing I just went straight for the story, which is able to suck one in enough to make you feel dizzy. But on the multiple viewings it becomes even more interesting as one can study the intricacy, and indeed full-on artistry, of Lang's camera. He puts it in unusual places at times, and adds for good measure shades of dark and gray in many of the night scene (this is, by the way, a precursor to 'film-noir', which Lang later became an important director in the 40's and 50's). On top of this, there is a very modern sense of style in the editing- I remember a couple of scenes that surprised me editing wise. One is where the cops (I think it was the cops) have an argument about the investigation- two of them get into a shouting match, and we get medium close-ups of them going back and forth. This is done quickly, with a kind of intensity that isn't even captured in today's thrillers. There is also the hunt for Lorre in the digging of the house, where Lang cuts around constantly, heightening the tension between the predators (the criminals) and the prey (Lorre), until it's almost too much to take.The disturbing aspects of the story, of child abduction and murder, have become benchmarks of a number of today's thrillers, where the cop is usually the subject and the killer left more in the shadows, in cat & mouse style. This doesn't happen here, and because of it by the time we get to the final scene, with Lorre being interrogated and giving his I can't help it speech, it becomes something poetic, tragic, frightening. Lang doesn't leave his message so simplistically, he makes sure we know Lorre's side too, however twisted it has become, and the antagonist is shown as human as opposed to these present-day thriller where the killers are barely given one dimension let alone two. There were reports that during filming Lang put Lorre through torture, ultimately causing the two to never work together again. But nevertheless, out of this comes a towering performance of a small, wild-eyed criminal in the midst of an extremely well-told and unpredictable mystery story. In short, if you don't know what you're in for when you hear that whistle, those several infamous notes, you may not at all.

First off--the title. Bram Stoker's Dracula. Oh really? I've read the book multiple times--this is NOT the book at all. Just the opening with how Dracula became wasn't from the book at all. It gets worse when they switch to 1897 London...and you see Jonathan Harker is played by Keanu Reeves! We all know Reeves can't act but seeing him trying to imitate an English accent was just jaw-dropping. He was TERRIBLE! He goes to Dracula's castle to help him move to London. There we met Oldman in terrible makeup giving one of his worst performances. He also seems to be wearing Japanese robes (for some reason). And he looks ugly--Dracula is supposed to be handsome. Also the shadows in the castle don't move with the people (???). It all leads to a stupid scene full of pointless female nudity where three female vampires attack Reeves. Reeves pretty much disappears after that (this is a good thing).We cut to London--Dracula comes aboard. Mina (Winona Ryder) is watching for Jonathan, her boyfriend. With her is her good friend Lucy (Sadie Frost). She behaves like a nymphomaniac--not in the book. Also there's a huge rainstorm when Mina and Lucy run around giggling and end up kissing. WHY? It leads to nothing and isn't in the book either. Then Dracula shows up, turns into a wolf man (???), lures Lucy out of her bed and rapes her (????) on top of a tombstone. Bites her too. Then Mina shows up and she is (sigh) the reincarnation of Dracula's dead wife. OK--that is the oldest, stupidest cliché in horror films and, again, not in the book.Lucy starts to slowly die--poor Frost has to wither around in bed with her breasts constantly being exposed. Her boyfriend (Cary Elwes) and suitors stand around and watch--they're given nothing to do. Also Dr. Seward (Richard E. Grant) pops up too and--for no reason--he's shown as a drug addict. Why? Again--not in the book. Then Van Helsing (Anthony Hopkins) is called in. He realizes what's happening. Lucy dies (after being raped by a wolf) and returns as a vampire (one of the few effective sequences). Of course she vomits blood on Van Helsing--for no reason other than to gross out the audience. She's killed (again) and Dracula starts romancing Mina in some truly boring sequences that drag on forever.It all leads up with the guys trying to get Dracula away from Mina and kill him. And the very end is (again) changed completely.OK--let's deal with the acting. Oldman--just dreadful. He's a good actor but not here. Let's put it this way--when somebody mentions cinematic Dracula do you think of Oldman? Ryder was actually very good but, purportedly, her and Oldman hated each other--it comes through loud and clear. Poor Frost is forced to be topless a lot and act sex-starved--she DOES pull it off however. Reeves--just the worst here--and that's saying a lot. Hopkins--what the HELL was he playing? He's acting like he's in a comedy--not a horror movie. Elwes and Campbell are given nothing to do. Grant is just OVER OVER the top (and annoying). Tom Waits is forgettable as Reinfield.The movie is chockful of visual tricks and stunning color--but it did nothing for me. It was nonstop and I got the impression that director Francis Ford Coppola was just showing off. Also it got tremendously annoying--I almost turned it off a few times. The special effects ARE good however (except for the stupid green mist that seduces Mina--don't ask). Also the music score is loud and overbearing. And what was with the costumes? An Asian man did them and Dracula seems dressed as he just popped in from China! Perhaps the gentleman should have been told Dracula is from Transylvania NOT China. I don't blame him though--Coppola probably told him to do that to add more color to the film.The script was hopeless--constantly straying from the novel. The title should be Francis Ford Coppola's Dracula or James Harts' Dracula (he was the screenwriter). Also--it wasn't scary at all. Not even a little (but Frost ALMOST makes it work in her vampire getup). My main problem is this tripe about Mina being Dracula's long-lost love (or something). Crap like that was clichéd back in the 1940s--it's almost insulting that this was stuck into a 1990s movie.This was a huge hit in 1992 (most likely cause it was advertised nonstop and Coppola did it) but now it's, rightfully, almost forgotten.

","genre":"Fantasy, Horror, Romance"},{"date":"29 July 2005","score":"6 out of 15 people found the following review useful","review":" Dracula (Gary Oldman) attacks London.OK-there are so many things wrong with this film it's hard to know where to start. First off--the title. Bram Stoker's Dracula. Oh really? I've read the book multiple times--this is NOT the book at all. Just the opening with how Dracula became wasn't from the book at all. It gets worse when they switch to 1897 London...and you see Jonathan Harker is played by Keanu Reeves! We all know Reeves can't act but seeing him trying to imitate an English accent was just jaw-dropping. He was TERRIBLE! He goes to Dracula's castle to help him move to London. There we met Oldman in terrible makeup giving one of his worst performances. He also seems to be wearing Japanese robes (for some reason). And he looks ugly--Dracula is supposed to be handsome. Also the shadows in the castle don't move with the people (???). It all leads to a stupid scene full of pointless female nudity where three female vampires attack Reeves. Reeves pretty much disappears after that (this is a good thing).We cut to London--Dracula comes aboard. Mina (Winona Ryder) is watching for Jonathan, her boyfriend. With her is her good friend Lucy (Sadie Frost). She behaves like a nymphomaniac--not in the book. Also there's a huge rainstorm when Mina and Lucy run around giggling and end up kissing. WHY? It leads to nothing and isn't in the book either. Then Dracula shows up, turns into a wolf man (???), lures Lucy out of her bed and rapes her (????) on top of a tombstone. Bites her too. Then Mina shows up and she is (sigh) the reincarnation of Dracula's dead wife. OK--that is the oldest, stupidest cliché in horror films and, again, not in the book.Lucy starts to slowly die--poor Frost has to wither around in bed with her breasts constantly being exposed. Her boyfriend (Cary Elwes) and suitors stand around and watch--they're given nothing to do. Also Dr. Seward (Richard E. Grant) pops up too and--for no reason--he's shown as a drug addict. Why? Again--not in the book. Then Van Helsing (Anthony Hopkins) is called in. He realizes what's happening. Lucy dies (after being raped by a wolf) and returns as a vampire (one of the few effective sequences). Of course she vomits blood on Van Helsing--for no reason other than to gross out the audience. She's killed (again) and Dracula starts romancing Mina in some truly boring sequences that drag on forever.It all leads up with the guys trying to get Dracula away from Mina and kill him. And the very end is (again) changed completely.OK--let's deal with the acting. Oldman--just dreadful. He's a good actor but not here. Let's put it this way--when somebody mentions cinematic Dracula do you think of Oldman? Ryder was actually very good but, purportedly, her and Oldman hated each other--it comes through loud and clear. Poor Frost is forced to be topless a lot and act sex-starved--she DOES pull it off however. Reeves--just the worst here--and that's saying a lot. Hopkins--what the HELL was he playing? He's acting like he's in a comedy--not a horror movie. Elwes and Campbell are given nothing to do. Grant is just OVER OVER the top (and annoying). Tom Waits is forgettable as Reinfield.The movie is chockful of visual tricks and stunning color--but it did nothing for me. It was nonstop and I got the impression that director Francis Ford Coppola was just showing off. Also it got tremendously annoying--I almost turned it off a few times.

The sense of doom in the squad of white-helmeted men, as their ship is swallowed up by a Star Destroyer and they wait for an attack they know they can not hold off, is presented in a short sequence of images that gives early notice of the film's stellar editing as well as direction and photography.

Garrett as adaptation to the screen and to Ben Hecht and David Selznick for the screenplay. Th sterling cinematography was done by the great lee Garmes, Harodl Rosson and Ray Rennahan, with production design by J. McMillan Johnson and art direction by James Basevi. Costumes were the work of famous designer Walter Punkett. Dimitri Tiomkin did the music and producer Selznick spared no expense to make this project work. He also quarreled with Vidor over the production, and is probably responsible for the literate but needless fatality element and narrated prologue that alter the production a bit but do not harm it badly. The argument by so-called critics has been about scale. Selznick, trying to repeat his triumph with Gone With the Wind they argued, kept trying to make his films 'bigger'--as if that were the key to an even-greater achievement in cinema for Selznick. But in this novel, the author is the one who suggested that the saloon in which the central character's mother dances was very large; I believe Selznick took this and the size of the desolate country within which the action takes place as cues for him to increase the physical scale of the drama. And for the most part, his decision seems to me to have been unarguably a good one. Many of the shots from Vidor and the other directors are legendary--riders racing along the tops of hills in silhouette against colorful skies, spacious interiors at the Spanish Bit ranch, the sump-hole sequence, the great dance sequence that ignites the action at the film's beginning, the train wreck disasters and many more... The story-line can actually be stated rather swiftly. Pearl Chavez is the daughter of an exotic female who dances and is married to a ne'er-do-well cultured fellow, a distant cousin of the wife of Senator McCanles, owner of a huge ranch in the 1880s. After her father kills his mother over a lover, and is hanged, Pearl is sent to live with the McCanles family. From the first, one son, Jesse, a lawyer, is attracted to her and she to Lewton, the wild cowboy scion of the family. She worries a lot about sin, but to no avail, since the viewer never sees any. What happens is a land dispute, which alienates Jesse from the senator and sends Lewt on a rampage against the railroad who has challenged his father's empire of cattle and dictatorial pseudo-benevolent despotism. he is also angry that Pearl has sent him away after being his lover. Realizing that she is as responsible as anyone for what Lewt has become, blaming her own sexuality for his wrongness, she goes after him and they shoot each other to rags on a desolate hillside, as they were perhaps fated to do in a U.S. mental environment of pseudo-Christian surrealism that helped make the Judge, Lewt and Pearl what they felt they had to be--and also set Jesse, the normative mind in the piece, as an outsider watching the dissolution of their hopes. The critics who have called the film never-dull, bizarre and a product of Selznick's tampering with the script have all been obviously correct; but as some have noted, when it is big the film is very good and memorable. From the great theme song to the powerful scenes, much of this re-engineered-fatalistic drama works. In the leads, Gregory Peck is handsome and showy, which he needs to be, to outshine his attractive but less-charismatic brother, very ably portrayed by Joseph Cotten. Lionel Barrymore does well as the dictatorial senator, and Lillian Gish as his wife proves to be very skilled indeed. Herbert Marshall as Scott Chavez and Tilly Losch are extremely fine; other very able supporting actors in the large cast who show to advantage include Walter Huston as a sin-killing preacher, Charles Bickford, Sidney Blackmer, Butterfly McQueen, Joan Tetzel, Scott McKay, Harray Caray and Otto Kruger. The central performer in the film is Jennifer Jones. I found her quiet and intelligent portrayal to be outstanding in every regard; she was lovely, repressed, sensual, bright, feral and tormented by turns. If Selznick intended this film as a showcase for his wife's wide range of acting abilities, I suggest it worked just about as intended. What is 'bizarre' about the film as a project, I suggest, apart from Selznick's torturing a simple melodrama into an epic drama and very cleverly too is that he then tried to reduce his splendid project to a diatribe against sensuality in order to turn its ending into a work of fate, or a commentary on human weakness. The two strains work against one another in the film at certain times, diminishing however only a little of the film's unusual power, only channeling it toward occasional exaggeration.

The critics who have called the film never-dull, bizarre and a product of Selznick's tampering with the script have all been obviously correct; but as some have noted, when it is big the film is very good and memorable. From the great theme song to the powerful scenes, much of this re-engineered-fatalistic drama works. In the leads, Gregory Peck is handsome and showy, which he needs to be, to outshine his attractive but less-charismatic brother, very ably portrayed by Joseph Cotten. Lionel Barrymore does well as the dictatorial senator, and Lillian Gish as his wife proves to be very skilled indeed. Herbert Marshall as Scott Chavez and Tilly Losch are extremely fine; other very able supporting actors in the large cast who show to advantage include Walter Huston as a sin-killing preacher, Charles Bickford, Sidney Blackmer, Butterfly McQueen, Joan Tetzel, Scott McKay, Harray Caray and Otto Kruger. The central performer in the film is Jennifer Jones. I found her quiet and intelligent portrayal to be outstanding in every regard; she was lovely, repressed, sensual, bright, feral and tormented by turns. If Selznick intended this film as a showcase for his wife's wide range of acting abilities, I suggest it worked just about as intended. What is 'bizarre' about the film as a project, I suggest, apart from Selznick's torturing a simple melodrama into an epic drama and very cleverly too is that he then tried to reduce his splendid project to a diatribe against sensuality in order to turn its ending into a work of fate, or a commentary on human weakness. The two strains work against one another in the film at certain times, diminishing however only a little of the film's unusual power, only channeling it toward occasional exaggeration. A splendid piece of film-making by Vidor and every one of the actors and creators involved in its realization ","genre":"Drama, Romance, Western"},{"date":"29 July 2005","score":"9 out of 13 people found the following review useful","review":" More critical nonsense has perhaps been written about Duel in the Sun than about any other U.S. made film. It is a big, intelligent and well-acted western. It had the great King Vido as the director for much of its beautiful footage,, plus contributions by several other very-fine directors. it was adapted from a good little novel by Niven Busch, with a script credited to Oliver H.P. Garrett as adaptation to the screen and to Ben Hecht and David Selznick for the screenplay. Th sterling cinematography was done by the great lee Garmes, Harodl Rosson and Ray Rennahan, with production design by J. McMillan Johnson and art direction by James Basevi. Costumes were the work of famous designer Walter Punkett. Dimitri Tiomkin did the music and producer Selznick spared no expense to make this project work. He also quarreled with Vidor over the production, and is probably responsible for the literate but needless fatality element and narrated prologue that alter the production a bit but do not harm it badly. The argument by so-called critics has been about scale. Selznick, trying to repeat his triumph with Gone With the Wind they argued, kept trying to make his films 'bigger'--as if that were the key to an even-greater achievement in cinema for Selznick. But in this novel, the author is the one who suggested that the saloon in which the central character's mother dances was very large; I believe Selznick took this and the size of the desolate country within which the action takes place as cues for him to increase the physical scale of the drama. And for the most part, his decision seems to me to have been unarguably a good one. Many of the shots from Vidor and the other directors are legendary--riders racing along the tops of hills in silhouette against colorful skies, spacious interiors at the Spanish Bit ranch, the sump-hole sequence, the great dance sequence that ignites the action at the film's beginning, the train wreck disasters and many more... The story-line can actually be stated rather swiftly. Pearl Chavez is the daughter of an exotic female who dances and is married to a ne'er-do-well cultured fellow, a distant cousin of the wife of Senator McCanles, owner of a huge ranch in the 1880s. After her father kills his mother over a lover, and is hanged, Pearl is sent to live with the McCanles family. From the first, one son, Jesse, a lawyer, is attracted to her and she to Lewton, the wild cowboy scion of the family. She worries a lot about sin, but to no avail, since the viewer never sees any. What happens is a land dispute, which alienates Jesse from the senator and sends Lewt on a rampage against the railroad who has challenged his father's empire of cattle and dictatorial pseudo-benevolent despotism. he is also angry that Pearl has sent him away after being his lover. Realizing that she is as responsible as anyone for what Lewt has become, blaming her own sexuality for his wrongness, she goes after him and they shoot each other to rags on a desolate hillside, as they were perhaps fated to do in a U.S. mental environment of pseudo-Christian surrealism that helped make the Judge, Lewt and Pearl what they felt they had to be--and also set Jesse, the normative mind in the piece, as an outsider watching the dissolution of their hopes.

Depp is what made this movie what it is. The plot is too ordinary and by far not unique enough. Even though I had never seen it before, I had felt like I saw it prior to the first time I actually did. However, Johnny Depp's character is what gives this movie its value, even though Christopher Walken is excellent in this movie too. A man named Gene Watson (Depp) and his daughter face a great deal of peril when two criminals who want the governor dead use Watson as a scapegoat and drastically blackmail him in the process. They kidnap his daughter and threaten to kill her by 130 if he doesn't kill the governor by then. They give him a job to do, and he desperately attempts to escape it by seeking out help by other people, but one of the criminals (Walken) stalks him and appears to be everywhere he tries to go. The final showdown is excellent and magnificently performed. This is a decent thriller, and I recommend it to anyone who likes Johhny Depp and expects a good action-packed and adventurous ride. 8\/10!

Their energy is also spent on things that are not important, day after day. They too , deep inside, have the urge to FIGHT.
