I had boycotted it for years, thinking it was too anti-Christian to support with my money, either renting or buying it. Finally, in the summer of 2005 I took a look after seeing several Burt Lancaster films and being reminded how good an actor he was. Well, he didn't disappoint here, either, with a fantastic performance as those of you who have seen this already know. Lancaster is absolutely mesmerizing as Elmer Gantry. At times I wondered if he wasn't overacting, but his character called for a very animated salesman-type person. So, I'll give him the credit and assume he was just playing his role, not hamming it up too much as it often appears.Gantry gave the best speeches in this film and even though many people think he was the charlatan all the way through, I disagree. I think he had changed in the end. At any rate, Lancaster made him into a believable person.He certainly was a lot more believable than Jean Simmons' female evangelist, Sister Sharon. Anyone who knows Scripture, knows that NO evangelist - real or not - would say or do some of the things she said-did in here. Nonetheless, Simmons gives just as riveting a performance as Lancaster, her character just being lower-key than the fiery Gantry.The most shocking role to me was played by wholesome (can you say Oklahoma!?) Shirley Jones, who only appears in the last part of this long film but plays a memorable character a hooker who had past encounters with Elmer Gantry and now wants to expose him for the womanizing heathen she thinks he is, and succeeds in doing so but is ashamed of her actions in the end. Arthur Kennedy also is fascinating as the skeptical atheist-type newspaper reporter who softens quite a bit at the end. Meanwhile, the big-city businessman George Babbitt (Edward Andrews) was the only really annoying and overblown character in the film and typical of what Hollywood does today when they want to make a relgious person look bad.I mention all these actors before remarking about the story because the acting and the characters are what make this movie so well-done and entertaining. As for the story, I don't believe this film is the expose and critical critique of evangelists Liberal film critics would have you believe. In fact, compared to filmmakers in the following decade - the '70s - they were quite tolerant. Sister Sharon was basically a sincere - if not misguided in spots - evangelist and a Believer and so was Elmer as he says at the end of the film.Yes, there is some theology nonsense in here that simply isn't Scriptural and there is an obvious Hollywood bias against evangelists, but I expected far worse. To be fair, there were a lot of Biblically-sound lines in this script, too. And - by the way - not all evangelists are corrupt, despite what you see on film. (Don't hold your breath waiting for Hollywood to do a bio on the most famous one of them all Billy Graham.)As a Christian, I still don't trust the intent of the filmmakers but I found the film fascinating overall and think it's excellent work. I'm glad I got the movie. Better late than never!

Watching a Bond movie was an event in people's lives and the next day they would spend hours recounting every cheap thrill, every bedded women and every fight to the death in the office or the playground. Looking at it now, you say very well made and structured - but hard to take seriously. Bond is - as usual - both very smart (according to the back story) and very stupid at the same time. Missing obvious clues and relying on luck to stay alive. In short, the polar opposite of what any real agent would do.Connery is an ex milkman from Edinburgh. He looks every woman's dream with his glue on hair and hairy barrel chest, but he is clearly a man that has never driven past a university no matter got a double first. He fights in a strange way too - always going for the chin and never working the downstairs first. All powerless - in real life - slappy arm punching.You have to admire the 1960's women's hairstyles and glasses. Puts about ten years on any woman. Did they have something against hair that moved in those days?

If you were a contestant on a TV game show and the producers offered you a load of money to do a fixed show where you're given the answers in advance, would you do it? Or would you turn your back on the producers and walk away? In this film, Charles Van Doren does not walk away, but he does hesitate. As played by Ralph Fiennes, he's a bright, likable fellow who seems like a good man despite his willing participation in a fraud.The film is smartly written, tightly plotted, and populated by interesting characters. It is also entertaining. It unfolds like a great detective story, except that no murder has taken place. There isn't even any crime. As shocking as it may seem, there were no laws against rigging a quiz show back in the 1950s, because no lawmaker had considered that such a thing would ever happen. When the scandal came to light, those working behind the scenes who engineered the fraud managed to survive with their careers intact, and the people who suffered the harshest consequences were the contestants, who were simply pawns. That says something about the distortions of television culture, but this theme, among others, is nicely understated in the film.Director Robert Redford has a gift for finding the drama in seemingly mundane topics, but not in a contrived or manipulative fashion. The '50s quiz show scandal is the sort of topic that could easily have made for a preachy and artificial TV movie. It's a great credit to Redford's film that it doesn't contain any long moralizing speeches. Though the movie has many great quotes, the characters talk like real people, and the situations grow out of their personalities. We end up rooting for several characters at once. We want Richard Goodwin (Rob Morrow), the lawyer sent to investigate the show, to succeed in uncovering the scandal. But we also feel for Van Doren, who almost comes off as a tragic hero. We even feel a little for the pathetic and unlikable Herb Stemple (John Turturro), the whistle-blower who's been bamboozled and humiliated by the producers.The movie works on the most basic level as simple drama, the high points being those scenes where Goodwin uncovers each new layer to the case. The first time I saw the film, I was put in mind of a detective story like Colombo. There's no mystery, of course, since we know from the start who the perpetrators are, what they did and how they did it. But the labyrinth of corruption that Goodwin must probe is fascinating to behold.Goodwin naively assumes he's practically taking down the network (the movie hints that the scandal goes to the very top) even though no laws were broken. The situation has the feel of a conspiracy, the people talking in euphemisms like they were mob bosses or something (For seventy grand you can afford to be humiliated). The contestants themselves are no dummies they are smart, knowledgeable people who could very well have been used honestly on a trivia show. The producers simply wanted to control the responses to make the show more dramatic. What made this unethical was the amount of deception it required. It's one thing to have entertainment that everyone knows is fake (e.g., pro-wrestling), it's quite another to pass off something phony as something real. Of course now I'm getting preachy, something I praised the movie for not doing. But that's exactly my point. In a lesser movie, there would have been characters explaining the distinction. Here, it's left to us to assess the situation. That's the best kind of movie, the kind that invites further discussion.Above all, the movie is about integrity and what defines it. Goodwin (in a classic reversal of our culture's typical view of lawyers) is the boy scout in the story, who says at one point that he would never have participated in the fraud if he were in Van Doren's shoes, and we believe him. But a large part of the film involves his relationship with Van Doren, a man he likes and doesn't want to hurt. His desire to protect Van Doren (but not Stemple) from ruin while bringing down the true perpetrators of the scandal leads to one of the movie's most memorable lines, when Goodwin's wife calls Goodwin the Uncle Tom of the Jews, because he's sticking up for a corrupt Gentile. We respect Goodwin and admire his reluctance to hurt Van Doren, but we, too, wonder whether he's handling the case with the proper objectivity.The movie has some interesting subtexts dealing with the anti-Semitism coming from Jewish producers themselves. In one scene, producers Dan Enright and Albert Freedman basically explain to Van Doren, in so many words, that Stemple is too Jewish for the show. This is a phenomenon I've rarely seen dealt with in the movies, possibly because there aren't too many films depicting the history of television.The film is often criticized for departing significantly from the facts of the case. For example, the real Goodwin actually played a minimal role in exposing the scandal. I can understand why those involved in the case may have resented these inaccuracies. But filmmakers do have dramatic license. Probably this film should have changed the names of the characters from their real-life counterparts, to reinforce the fact that it's not an exact account of what happened. The purpose of movies isn't to duplicate real life, but to reflect on real life, to gain fresh insight, and Quiz Show achieves that purpose with dignity and style.

But love makes you do silly things and due to a recent change in my circumstances (like getting engaged), I felt maybe it was time for something mushy. However, those of you expecting a regular light-hearted rom-com might be disappointed as this is actually a bit of a downer movie and hankies might be needed by the end.Sandra Bullock plays southern belle Birdee Pruitt, former Texan beauty queen and married to former college quarterback star and high-school sweetheart Bill (Michael Paré). But when it's revealed on national TV that Bill is having an affair, Birdee returns to her hometown of Smithville with her daughter Bernice (Mae Whitman) to stay with her mother Ramona (Gena Rowlands). As Birdee becomes ever more despondent, her life is held together by her eccentric mother and the affection of her old school buddy Justin Matisse (Harry Connick Jr).While considerably better than the last Bullock movie I saw (the woeful Fire On The Amazon), I wasn't expecting much and I wasn't disappointed. Bullock is totally upstaged by the impressive Whitman as her troubled daughter struggles to cope with this most public of break-ups. Perhaps Bullock should have paid more attention to the youngster and learnt how to have played her role a bit better. The plot, such as it is, isn't too bad but is certainly less rosy than I had expected. As Birdee's problems multiply and her despair grows ever more, you struggle to see where the happy ending will come from - until the gangly cowboy Lothario of Connick Jr appears. The romance is strictly predictable, even if it is a little hard to swallow given Birdee's initial reluctance. But the whole thing is not exactly my cup of tea, although even I will watch a film like this that is any good, like Notting Hill. But Hope Floats is neither a romantic comedy or a traditional weepie like Dying Young and spends most of its time treading water and going nowhere.For a film that goes nowhere for ages, I can still see why some (female) viewers will enjoy this like my fiancé. But for me, I prefer a romantic film that makes me feel warm and fuzzy on the inside. Sadly, Hope Floats makes me feel sleepy instead.

It also fails to make any decent points about the impact of sensationalist TV on those who appear to air their dirty laundry in public. Any questions that are asked come mainly from the performance of Ms Whitman.

While I don't think Psycho should have been touched, we all know how the movie industry is. If there had to be a sequel this was a relatively interesting idea.

It is impossible to be judicious about it. If you see a thriller that doesn't thrill, you just shrug your shoulders. But if you see a comedy that doesn't make you laugh, you feel insulted. You hate the movie and you hate the fact that other people think it is a riot.Actually, it is not all comedies that polarise reactions in this way. If the comedy arises naturally from the characters or the situations then movies can be enjoyable, even if they elicit no more than the occasional smile. The problems arise when the characters or situations have no rationale except to be funny. That is the problem here.I find this movie a hopeless, exasperating experience because nothing in it exists except to get laughs and for me it doesn't.The characters are infuriating. Katherine Hepburn never looked better. She is so beautiful it could make you cry, but within about ten minutes I was praying for Cary Grant to strangle this impossible, self-centred, gibbering chatterbox. It probably took Hepburn years to live down the ill-will this movie generated.Cary Grant fares nearly as badly. He was completely emasculated and playing against type. When the Hepburn character falls in love with him you feel she must have been watching his other movies because this ineffectual wimp couldn't possibly have attracted her.Charlie Ruggles is just pathetically begging for laughs. They don't come.Similarly, all the 'comic' situations are painfully contrived. It is one of those movies where people are constantly being misunderstood and constantly doing things that baffle other people. But the comedy is not generated by the perplexing situations in which the characters find themselves. It derives from the fact that nobody can explain any of their actions intelligibly, nobody listens to what anybody else says and nobody is allowed to finish a sentence. If they could or did, it would instantly defuse the situations and kill the comedy. But comedy that relies on relentlessly improbable or unreasonable behaviour is the laziest kind of comedy.To make things worse, the movie has no focus. There are three almost independent comic threads. Firstly, Hepburn is trying to prevent Grant from marrying. This is problematic, because for most of the movie she has no reason to suppose that Grant doesn't love his fiancé; that she doesn't love him; that she is wrong for him; or that Grant really loves her. If this plot element was isolated, the Hepburn character would be left exposed as a highly unsympathetic, manipulative bitch.Fortunately, this dubious premise is diluted with the business of the dog and the loss of the 'intercostal clavicle' (the best comic idea in the picture). Then, on top of that, we get the roaming Baby and the confusion with the second leopard. But rather than this being a rich comic mixture, the picture seems overstuffed and directionless. To paper over the cracks, the movie races along without any variation in pace or tone and seems much longer than it actually is. It might have some good lines in it, but they are all lost in the machine gun delivery that everybody effects. All this frantic activity is trying to cover for a lack of real comic invention. It sweats desperation from every pore.Comedy probably dates more quickly than any other sort of entertainment. We cannot always judge the impact of a comedy film by our responses today. However, this film cannot be excused in that way. It was given the thumbs down by audiences when it was first released.I have to applaud their good judgement.

","genre":"Comedy, Romance"},{"date":"23 October 2006","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Pretty Woman came at the end of the decade that gave us the greed is good mentality and the concept of the yuppie, so it is perhaps fitting that the male lead, Edward Lewis, is a ruthless millionaire businessman. Lewis specialises in taking over companies, splitting them up and selling off the profitable parts. While in Los Angeles to conclude a deal, he gets lost while driving in his car and stops to ask directions from an young woman named Vivian, who just happens to be a prostitute. Edward's work involves a good deal of socialising, but being divorced and having recently split up with his girlfriend, he has no female partner to accompany him. Much taken with the attractive Vivian, he offers her $3000 to be his escort for the week. Of course, this being a romantic comedy, they end up falling in love with one another. As has often been pointed out, that is not a realistic story line. Indeed, this film has been criticised for its lack of realism, but romantic comedies, especially that sub-category of the genre dealing with love between people of different social backgrounds, are not generally supposed to be exercises in kitchen-sink realism. Contrary to what we might have been led to believe by Maid in Manhattan, for example, most Republican senators (or Democrat ones for that matter) are not married to Latina chambermaids. Nor (pace Richard Curtis in Notting Hill) do female Hollywood superstars generally find the love of their life working in small bookshops in West London. It is a historical fact that no British Prime Minister has ever married his tea-lady (not even Palmerston, whose appetite for working-class girls was legendary), so it seems that Mr Curtis got it wrong in Love, Actually as well. Like Maid in Manhattan and Love, Actually, Pretty Woman is a modern dress version of all those old fairy tales about the poor girl who falls in love with a prince. The film has also been criticised by certain moralists for giving an excessively romantic and glamorised picture of prostitution. Certainly, it is not exactly realistic to suggest that every prostitute is a beautiful, healthy, carefree Julia Roberts lookalike who ends up marrying a handsome millionaire. On the other hand, the moralists' preferred position on prostitution- that every prostitute is a drug-addicted disease-ridden crack whore living in squalid poverty who ends up either dying of AIDS or being murdered by a modern Jack the Ripper- is equally unrealistic. Vivian is an example of the tart with a heart, a stock character who has been part of the literary tradition going back at least as far as La Dame aux Camellias (when Vivian and Edward go to the opera together, it is to see La Traviata, based upon Dumas's story) and part of the cinematic tradition since at least the sixties, when film censorship began to be relaxed. (Think, for example, of Audrey Hepburn in Breakfast at Tiffany's). Julia Roberts's performance in this film was reminiscent of Audrey Hepburn in another way. Hepburn had the ability to seize hold of any film and, through the force of her personality, make it entirely her own so that one just cannot imagine any other actress in the leading role. That is just what Roberts does here. Vivian may be a tart, but Roberts makes her so lovable, playful and full of life that the audience instantly fall in love with her. (The use of the Christian name Vivian may have been deliberately significant on the part of the scriptwriters- it is derived from the same Latin root, meaning living, that gives us the word vivacious- the word that best sums up Roberts's character). There are thematic links with two other Hepburn films, Sabrina and My Fair Lady, which also feature poor girls who fall in love with wealthy men. (Vivian is seen watching a fourth Hepburn film, Charade, on television). The relationship between Vivian, who gradually learns social graces under Edward's tutelage, parallels that between Eliza and Higgins in My Fair Lady. In this film, made when she was a promising starlet, Roberts plays a woman in love with a high-status man. By the time she made Notting Hill nine years later, she had become an established star, and the roles were reversed; her character, Anna, is the high-status woman in love with a man from a humbler background. In both films, however, it is the lower-status character who is mentally stronger. Anna is beautiful and successful but insecure. Similarly, Richard Gere's Edward has been immensely successful in business and outwardly appears confident and self-possessed. Underneath, however, he is also insecure, going through a crisis of conscience about his dubious business ethics and worried by the fact that he makes his money through financial sleight of hand, without ever producing anything tangible. He admits that his main psychological motivation has been anger against his father, from whom he was estranged. There is a sub-plot involving Edward's attempts to take over a family-owned shipbuilding firm; he gradually comes to respect the elderly patriarch who has built that company up, and there is a suggestion that he has come to see the old man as a substitute father. Pretty Woman may be an unrealistic, cliché-ridden story, a fairy-story in modern dress, but, like Notting Hill, it does have some psychological depth. Moreover, it was so well done, and Roberts and Gere both play their parts so well, that I couldn't help enjoying it. 7\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"23 October 2006","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Pretty Woman came at the end of the decade that gave us the greed is good mentality and the concept of the yuppie, so it is perhaps fitting that the male lead, Edward Lewis, is a ruthless millionaire businessman.

Well, who am I kidding, I knew it was going to be crap, but this was bad even for a Friday 13th Movie. I mean, come on! Jason X = Friday 13th Part 10!? The plot is basically this. In the year 2000 they have Jason all tied up so scientists can examine him, to figure out why this dude simply can't die (they tried gassing him, electrocuting him, hell, even hanging him but nothing seems to work) but Jason escapes and kills five of the six right off. He chases one girl into a freezer room, where she tricks him and locks him in. But alas, he drives his machete right through the wall and into our hero who's name I cannot even remember and personally don't care. This sets off some alarm, and the room which contains the freezer room shuts down, and they both freeze.In 2455, a group of scientists discover the frozen bodies and they take them back to the ship. They find out they can resurrect the girl, but not Jason. They bring the girl back to life, and update her on the last 455 years (basically the earth was destroyed so humans inhabited another planet, or something like that) But they accidentally bring Jason back to life and he goes on a pointless killing rampage, with no original deaths. In fact, the only difference in this movie than to any of other Friday 13th movie is that they're on a space ship. They only thing that even made me smile slightly is a scene when a soldier backs up onto one of the spaceship walls, and Jason stabs him through the stomach, impaling him in the wall. The scene goes like thisIts gonna take more than a poke in the ribs to kill this old soldier (another knife comes through his chest) That outta do it Didn't laugh? You wern't amused?

Hitler, too, had encouraged such bullying, to either weed out or toughen the weak, although I would have to give even if not especially him at least enough credit to where, much more probably, no such double standard would have been so piously, rancorously enforced, under his jurisdiction! . . . The physical education instructors, especially, were always emphasizing militarism, and encouraging their closest friends among the students to relentlessly pursue their favorite sadistic pastime, of systematically destroying the self-images of every nerd on campus, so as to feed off the condition of degradation which resulted! . . . Moreover, most females, who otherwise whine about brutes, are characteristically at the vanguard of this persecution; until it's hardly any wonder that so many males symbiotically cleave, sexually, to other males, where they can both play the female role, with relation to one-another! Many females also aspire to being men, while feeling smugly certain they can have it both ways! . . . Such cleverly amusing satire may, however, only succeed, overall, at unoffensively smoothing out too many of the roughest edges! Thus, for a much more grimly candid portrayal of the kinds of damage people succeed at doing to one-another, until it's sometimes vomited right back out, Charles Bronson's Ten to Midnight deserves much more scrutiny!

However, it's actually James Dean, in Rebel Without a Cause, which is my own much more realistically normative Cup of Tea! I struggled, in school, and at home, with exactly the same problems! The details of what Jim Stark had to endure, internally, too, as the kind of person he was, were all very accurately portrayed, with relation to me; save, that is, for his most tragically climactic experience, in the middle, as well as the hopefully promising ending. Parenthetically, Plato (All Remember Sal Mineo, Don't They?), too, was a Dismally Unheeded Warning, Even To This Very Day, and Despite So Many More Of Them Now! Moreover, I Had To Experience What Plato Felt, Too; But, Again, Thank God, Not The Kind Of Thing He Finally Ended Up Doing!!! . . . Even My later experience, as Cal, in East of Eden, shall continue, Thank God (minus any doubt about what He Wills!), keeping me as intact as it did him, since I haven't yet reached the very end of it. But, as for Giant? I'm just lucky enough, at least, never to have had the money--or the racism!!! For another glaring view of this kind of problem, compare the difference between the Jonas Cord, Sr., of Brian Keith, in Nevada Smith, and Leif Erickson, in The Carpetbaggers! Consider, also, a very old man, in Amadeus, who never could quite grasp the answer to a question which had been perpetually in front of his very nose! Burt Lancaster's Robert Stroud, the Birdman of Alcatraz, was a more valuable gift of longevity, bestowed by Woodrow Wilson; although Cordell Walker, Texas Ranger, wasn't so lucky with a little boy he had just about talked out of suicide, before the boy slipped accidentally and tragically to his death! Many continue to ask why the Lord, if there really is one, after-all, permits such senselessly wasteful tragedies to occur; while, at the same time, He's undoubtedly asking why almost everybody permits such expensively vital lessons to go no less thoroughly to waste! Kirk Douglas said it well, several years ago, in a television ad Prospective suicides don't really want to die, they just want to stop the pain!!! But as for Mark Twain's Sid Sawyer? There's real nerd, the kind who is just looking for trouble.
