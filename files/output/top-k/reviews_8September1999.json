In this movie, a heroic president (Bill Pullman), a crackerjack fighter pilot (Will Smith), and a computer programmer (Jeff Goldblum), with some help, manage to defeat the combined efforts of an entire species that has been scoping Earth out for decades in. . . two or three days.Words cannot describe how stupid these aliens are.  We'll leave aside the unlikelihood that a species thousands of years ahead of us technologically still hasn't advanced culturally beyond the rob-and-pillage society of the 13th-century Mongols.  It seems unlikely, but you have to admit that we humans have kept on being pretty brutal to each other despite our advancing technology.  But why would such aliens do something like blast Earth's cities, building by building, to get rid of us?  That's something like trying to exterminate ants by stomping on them one by one.  If the aliens wanted to get rid of us, they'd just bioengineer a microbe specifically bred to eliminate only humans, or whatever species they wanted to eliminate.  Humans are only a hundred years at most away from being able to do this; to highly advanced aliens it would be routine, especially when they've putatively been spying on us and experimenting on us for decades.  They expose their flying saucers to attack from Earth's combined air forces, for no visible reason.  It's enough to make you wonder how these aliens ever lasted this long in the planet-conquering business.Then, of course, there's Goldblum using a computer virus to defeat the aliens, which makes about as much sense as the idea of using ENIAC to sabotage a Cray.  No, make that less sense.  And there's an alien that keels over at one punch from Will Smith but then kills half a dozen scalpel-armed lab technicians a few scenes later.  This goes beyond any reasonable suspension of disbelief; it's just plain lazy writing.Jeff Goldblum's acting is wooden and unappealing, and the characters are extremely one-dimensional.  I know some will say to forget about these matters and just be entertained, but that's not the point; I *need* to see some interesting people to be entertained, and the feeling of having my intelligence insulted makes for a less entertaining experience.  By the same token, thoughtful scripts and fleshed out characters aren't just more prestigious and more arty; they're a lot more entertaining, too!Anyway, there are some good points to INDEPENDENCE DAY.  Aside from Goldblum, the acting is mostly pretty good.  Will Smith is passably cocky and arrogant, and Bill Pullman has some charisma as the president.  Judd Hirsch is so good that he manages to give some life to his cliche character.  There are some humorous one-liners such as Welcome to Earth! and Nobody's perfect.The special effects truly are breathtaking at times, as when the shadow of the alien ship creeps over whole cities at a time.  I truly did feel as the Carib Indians must have felt when Columbus landed on Hispaniola and confronted them with something totally outside the range of their experience.  Off the big screen, this effect would be lost, so I don't recommend renting this movie on video tape.A man like Whitmore could never be president of the United States, but I can see what Emmerich was trying for; this is the guy a lot of Americans wish they had as president, instead of the snake-oil salesmen we usually get.  And while it's totally unrealistic, even given his pilot's experience, that Whitmore would fly in combat, it sure would be nice to have a president who knew that the country would survive just fine even if he died.  (America has had five presidents die in office; the country survived each time none the worse for wear).Oddly I feel compelled to defend this stupid movie from its detractors in at least one respect; its American patriotism.  Patriotism, American or otherwise, is not in and of itself a bad thing to have in a movie.  CASABLANCA is loaded with French patriotism (they play La Marseillaise at least twice); THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING is chock full of British patriotism; the Oscar-winning MRS. MINIVER is also full of British patriotism;  EXODUS is to a great degree an exercise in Israeli patriotism; and the much-hailed ALEKSANDR NEVSKI is a celebration of Russian patriotism.  Americans should be allowed their own patriotic movies (though preferably higher quality than this one).  Pullman has repeatedly been excoriated for suggesting that July 4 would become an international holiday, completely missing the point that such a holiday would be celebrating not American independence, but rather the combined efforts of *all* the world's countries to fight off the alien scourge, an event that certainly would deserve international commemoration and which happened to occur on July 4.Lazy, dumb, overblown and insulting, INDEPENDENCE DAY is not worth renting.  But it is not as worthless as some would have you believe, and if by some chance it returns to the dollar theater, you could do worse than see a little humor and some good special effects on the wide screen, if you're in a tolerant mood.Rating ** out of ****.

Whoever you are... you have no creativity, and your mind is about as open as the gate to Area 51. But then again, we're all entitled to our own opinions, right? ;)This movie broke all the rules. Those who went to see it expecting chainsaws and gore or things suddenly leaping out at people are in for a surprise. I'm not saying movies like the Alien series or Scream, etc., aren't good...

However, this isn't one of those movies that rank in a class above others.  Kramer vs. Kramer is a very good movie that could be placed in the good movie class.  But if anyone is to say that it's excellent, it's natural that they would say that for Hoffman's Oscar-winning performance  Hoffman is Ted Kramer and Meryl Streep is his wife.  The movie begins in the middle of the night.  Meryl Streep walks into her son's room as he sleeps and wakes him up to tell him goodbye.  We automatically guess that she is going to leave her husband and her son.  The only problem is that Ted doesn't much time with his son so he doesn't know what he likes and hates.  And so begins Ted's true discovery of his love for his son.  However,  his wife comes back after a while and asks Ted to be allowed to have the boy back for a short while.  After his refusal, Meryl Streep takes Hoffman to court demanding custody of the child.  The end of the movie is probably the best part of it.  The trial scenes are excellent and the ending is one of the sweetest saddest and yet happy endings ever.  The best scene of the movie has got to be the ice cream scene.

Stark is a good word - but it is effective, and also beautiful. Bjørn Floberg also turns in a solid performance as the prime suspect.

It wipes the floor with most of them.Ok, this is not the most brilliant movie ever, but it´s a very, very, very good one. Much, much better than the unimaginative cr@p that they make this days. This has tons of special effects, but it has a very good story wich keeps us interested up untill the end. And it´s full of small references to the original Bram Stocker - DRACULA novel, wich makes another motive to see this a couple more times, just to spot them.This must be the best mix between sci-fi and horror movies ever. ALIEN was excelent, but LIFEFORCE is much more fun to watch, it might not have the same suspanse, but when London gets invaded by zombies, this movie becomes a very tense experience.Just for the destruction scenes of London, this movie is worth seeing. The guys who made this, realy did depict a very good version of an apocaliptic end of the world ! I would love to see another movie like this, but this time with much more than London being devastated.The initial scenes set in space are great. The atmosphere is incredible, and we keep waiting for something real bad to happen, during the whole thing. Then the movie almost completely changes it´s style and becomes one of those old english sci-fi mysteries for a while, then suddenly hell breaks loose and it changes into a doomsday apocaliptic scenario where everything can happen. And everything happens right up untill the last moment !Great stuff and very chilling sometimes also. Oh and the vampire girl could suck my energy anytime. -)The apocalypse is a fantastic theme for a story, but up untill now, no one except the makers of LIFEFORCE managed to create such great depiction of a final chaos on a movie screen.So watch this movie. It might have lots of flaws, but who cares, the story is great, its original, it´s very well made, it´s scary, it´s erotic, it has exelent action scenes, and the zombies are very good. This is a perfect mix of lots of genres put togheter. I only wish this movie was much longer than the 90 minutes it has. Anyway it has everything !And it should have more people watching it.

Patton's diary entries and letters edited by Martin Blumenson.  Having seen the movie, I think that no actor has ever better captured the spirit of a man better than George C. Scott, nor has any movie better portrayed that spirit than PATTON.Patton was a man who lived for war.  World War II was the high point and culmination of his life.  He didn't fight for any principles, he didn't fight to defend freedom or democracy or any abstract idea; he fought because he loved fighting.  In his diaries you can read of his fear of flunking out of West Point; the prospect terrified him because he was certain that he would never be good at anything except being a general or a leader of a country.  As a leader of men, he was exceptional.  His speech at the beginning of the movie is vintage Patton, an almost exact reproduction of a speech Patton actually gave to Third Army.  It's tough, and no-nonsense; Patton lets you know in no uncertain terms that he is here to win, to destroy the enemy, and by God you'd better be too.  I don't know if Patton actually directed traffic on the roads as he is shown doing in the movie, but it was a very Pattonish thing to do.  Patton did on at least one occasion get out of his staff car and join a squad of G.I.'s in heaving a vehicle out of the mud.  Try to imagine Montgomery doing that; the very thought is hilarious!Patton's character explains his treatment of his men.  To those who had been wounded fighting for him he was always kind and considerate.  But to those whose minds could not stand the horrible strain that war imposed on them, he was merciless; he could not comprehend the fact that other people didn't share his love of violence for violence' sake.  PATTON shows this aspect of his character very well.Karl Malden's Omar Bradley is shown in an almost father-like role; he sees and recognizes Patton's immense talents as a general, and uses them in spite of Patton's natural ability to antagonize everybody around him.  Not shown in the movie is Patton's unloveable characteristic of turning on his subordinates once they surpassed him in their careers.  Patton had nothing but good to say about Bradley, until Bradley was promoted over Patton's head, whereupon Patton savaged Bradley in his diary.  Patton did the same to Eisenhower.A general can have no higher compliment than the fear and respect of his adversaries, and as PATTON demonstrates, Patton was more feared by the Germans than any other Allied general, at least on the Western front.  As one German officer observes all too prophetically, the absence of war will destroy him Patton.  And although mankind's single greatest stroke of good fortune in the 20th century was that Russia and America never came to blows, it is still hard not to feel sorry for Patton as he desperately seeks his superiors' approval to carry the war on eastward into the Soviet Union - anything, just to have a war to fight.  Patton is like an addict to a destructive drug.Hollywood has rarely given us such a textured and human portrait of a great man cruel, often foolish in his relations with others, rude, and psychopathically attached to violence, but brave, dedicated, and loyal.  Certainly those who, like myself, have Jewish blood, or who were otherwise marked for death by the Nazi state, all owe him a great debt of gratitude for his pivotal role in destroying that state.  And yet, had he been born German, Patton would surely have fought just as devotedly for the Nazi side.  I'm glad he wasn't.Rating **** out of ****.

And yet, had he been born German, Patton would surely have fought just as devotedly for the Nazi side.  I'm glad he wasn't.Rating **** out of ****.

However, it is also a movie with a terrible script and a very disappointing performance by one of those actors (namely Nicholas Cage). There is no discernible story arc or character arc, leaving the viewer with a very pretty almost-was of a romance. There were several disturbingly implausible parts that really hurt the over- all credibility of the film. (Yeah, I know, what about the angels?, etc.) For an angel in a world where there really is a God, Cage seems much too eager to become human. He falls prey to lust much more quickly than you would believe a guardian angel could. His angel friend seems to be almost completely uncaring about Cage's feelings, except for odd moments like his sitcom laugh while watching Cage in the ocean. Meg Ryan's character adapts very well (and rather confidently) to this strange man who wears all black, knows her name, and pops up EVERYWHERE she goes. You'd think that, especially in a city, any woman would be VERY careful, if not outright scared of such a man. The moment when she realizes he cannot bleed cries itself into five minutes of ambiguity. What does she make of it? Is that a frightened, confused, or sad reaction? Why does a guardian angel, a being made to protect people, not have a clue how to handle this one person? This leaves the viewer to wonder if anybody (including the screenwriter) knows what's going on anymore. As far as Cage's acting, it seemed to me that the blank, staring eyes and toneless speech were not an artistic rendition of what he thought an angel would be like, but rather it was the bored look of someone who is getting millions of dollars to walk through a piece of trash movie. The one bright spot was the solid performance of Dennis Franz. Meg Ryan was her usual charming, otherwise unremarkable self.

I remember it being released in America sometime in 1994 or 1995, and from the plot and the reviews it looked brilliant.

This movie is a candidate of the list of films which everyone seemed to love, but why?It was like a cult musical. In the begining, the two girls are running around and singing to the soundtrack in the background. The movie (and this scene) supposedly stressed obsession and what it could lead to, but it never really introduced how these two got together or what the obsession was caused from. They were deeply in love with eachother. Why? How? And so what? It may have been based on a true story, but how about a little more insight on the character's personality and what really caused one another to commit such a heinous act? Melanie Lynskey was the most believable character in the movie. She had emotions that were believable and she acted her age. Kate Winslet was wooden, cold, and looked like she was in her early 20s. Instead of best friends just into each other's own world, Winslet was the domineering one and a contributing factor as to why this incident happened.Peter Jackson's trademark in all his films is to sickeningly move the camera around like a roller-coaster, and to use special effects to gel with the plot.
