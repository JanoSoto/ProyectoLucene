Or rather I should say, I enjoy the first half or so of this movie. As is typical of John Hughes 2-3 year golden period in the 80s, this movie kind of peters out for me about midway through, probably around the time they all get high. That said, I am under no illusions about the quality of this film. The cast, all young actors who became bastions of the decade's films but struggled outside of the eighties, are as laboured as ever in these stereotyped roles. Each one is, admittedly, being expected to play up to their 'title' in the movie to a certain degree. However, when given an emotional range to portray, each one of these kids flubs it (does anyone buy for a second the 'tender side' of Judd Nelson's character?). The direction is typical Hughes, for the time and beyond. It's hard to imagine he does much more than set up the camera and say 'Action!' most of the time, because those rare occasions he tries anything inventive it goes awry (e.g., the pan shot around the stoned circle that gets obscured for several seconds by the rail). But he's never needed to stretch his directorial muscle and nobody's ever wanted him to we see his movies to be entertained by quirky, endearing characters, not to be stunned by his camera work. And that's what he does here. This is, likewise, a typical Hughes story. A group of kids are thrust together in an unlikely circumstance (in-school suspension is typical to teenhood, sure, but at least three of these kids effectively chose to be there). They find a little bit of themselves in each other, and vice versa. All come out (perhaps) changed by the experience. This is what Hughes does...or did, anyway he designs likable characters, in spite of their flaws, who you want to see pull it together by the end of the film. We do, and they kind of do. I'd like to believe that it's just that this movie came out when I was their age that makes this a more poignant and precise picture of teenage mentality. I don't think, however, that there has been another movie that attempts to draw a broadly outlined picture of the teenage personality and does it sympathetically. Most teen pictures within the past 15 years do, of course, specialise in the broadly drawn characters...but you as a viewer are rarely expected to sympathise with any but the 'hero.' Unfortunately, this movie has grown extremely dated in the time since its release, and I'd be surprised if most teenagers today could find any reason to watch it. A shame, truly, because a film like this becomes a significant pop-cultural milestone for its generation, and every generation should have one.

Welcome to the Dollhouse is not one that most find meddling around somewhere in the middle mainly because this is a difficult film to watch. This is not to say that the direction is bad or the acting is atrocious, but instead its deep roots deal with issues that are difficult to swallow. Dawn Wiener is not your typical hero in which she is redeemed at the end of the film and praised as the newest addition to the popular crowd. There is no big entrance, there is no singing school band, in fact, there is very little of anything except the Weiner family's excitement of being on television. We, as audience members, want to feel bad for Dawn, but we cannot just laugh her off as a comedy character. She reminded me of Napoleon Dynamite. While most laughed at the actions and words of Napoleon (Jared Heder), it was actually very sad the situations surrounding him. The same can be said of Dawn. When I talk to friends about this film they typically (after already getting excited about the discussion or denouncing the entire film) say that it was a humorous film. Dawn is a funny character. Even film sites label this film under the category of comedy, and while there may be small elements of humor sprinkled throughout the film, I think it is far from being a laugh-out-loud comedy. Welcome to the Dollhouse is a tragedy about society, family structures, and being the outcast that never quite fit in.Todd Solondz has single-handedly created a masterpiece that will be studied and respected for years to come in the film community. He has taken elements so cliché in our cinema society and twisted them a bit to give us sincerity and anxiety compiled together. His choice of both music and camera placement only further develop these intense emotions. We want to laugh at this film, we don't want to feel sympathy for Dawn, but Solondz forces us to almost immediately. It feels during this film that Solondz actually may have gone to school with all of us, watching our moments of embarrassment and writing them down for future reference. I loved the sounds that Solondz used to define this film. That wild mix of guitar and drum create a feeling that something is going to happen, thus keeping us all glued to the edge of our seats. While Solondz obviously makes Dawn the center of this film, it is his attention to detail with the surrounding characters which really make Welcome to the Dollhouse more than you typical Hollywood fare. I wanted to see more of Dawn's older brother; I thought he was a tight juxtaposition between Dawn and her sister, Missy. He was also ignored by his parents, but he seemed to be comfortable with it. He knew his role, and while he wanted to escape it, he also fit well within. I don't believe than any actress could have pulled Dawn's mother off any better than Angela Pietropinto. Her facial expressions and impeccable timing demonstrated to us that Dawn's pressures did not just evolve at school, but also continued at home. I just thought that Solondz created a real family with the Wieners. One that most films are afraid to capture on film, but seem very real to the audience.Finally, I would like to add that I believe this to be a pivotal film in our film culture. While others may disagree, I think that Solondz has created a masterpiece. I didn't realize this at first, and for most I will suggest more than one viewing, but the final chapter to this film is really a powerhouse of great acting, promising discovery, and a horrifying truth. You will not end this film with butterflies and song, but instead realism, which is the honesty that Solondz bring to the table with Welcome to the Dollhouse. The acting is a bit amateurish, but what puts a smile to my face is the ability that Solondz had to make this work. Dawn is not an actor playing a teenage, but instead feels like a teenager playing herself. Solondz typically uses unknown actors (in the films that really pack a wallop) which allows us to look past the acting and deeply into the story, which is why I didn't focus too much of my review on the acting. It seemed natural, and for me I was more interested in what Solondz wanted to do, and not so much how his cast wanted to say it. This was a Todd Solondz film.As you watch his later work, you will see Solondz evolve a bit (Happiness), and go a bit mainstream (or at least as much as he can with Storytelling), but will come back full circle giving us a match to Welcome to the Dollhouse avant-guard cinema with Palindromes. He is a masterful director, but not one that mainstream Hollywood is willing to embrace (thankfully!). His work, especially with this film, creates uneasiness in you that you cannot shake after watching. He creates visions and impressions that remain with you long after the final credits have rolled, but he is an acquired taste. Solondz is not for everyone, but for those willing to give him a chance, watch his films without the panoramic explosive eye; than I think you will find that there is nobody else like him out in our film community. I cannot wait to see where his vision will take us next as well as I cannot wait to add Welcome to the Dollhouse to my film collection.Grade ***** out of ***** ","genre":null},{"date":"23 August 2006","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" This film is one that you will either desperately hate, or you will scream your excitement to your friends at any given opportunity.

This was a Todd Solondz film.As you watch his later work, you will see Solondz evolve a bit (Happiness), and go a bit mainstream (or at least as much as he can with Storytelling), but will come back full circle giving us a match to Welcome to the Dollhouse avant-guard cinema with Palindromes. He is a masterful director, but not one that mainstream Hollywood is willing to embrace (thankfully!). His work, especially with this film, creates uneasiness in you that you cannot shake after watching. He creates visions and impressions that remain with you long after the final credits have rolled, but he is an acquired taste. Solondz is not for everyone, but for those willing to give him a chance, watch his films without the panoramic explosive eye; than I think you will find that there is nobody else like him out in our film community. I cannot wait to see where his vision will take us next as well as I cannot wait to add Welcome to the Dollhouse to my film collection.Grade ***** out of ***** ","genre":"Comedy, Drama"},{"date":"23 August 2006","score":"4 out of 8 people found the following review useful","review":" I have an astonishing confession to make I have never actually read the book written by Bram Stoker. However, I do have a vague idea of how the story goes. There's this alarmingly mysterious character that lives in a castle in Transylvania who goes by Count Dracula. He possessed some dude he met named Renfield to secretly find some victims with fresh, delicious blood and to eat nothing but insects and thrive on their souls. Dracula picks the wrong girl to bite (Lucy) and after her health and behavior become questionable (along with Renfield's actions), her peers seek the help of Professor Van Helsing, not a Broadway-loving Australian but a doctor who specializes in the abnormal. Lucy dies and rises again as a bloodsucker, only to be murdered again by the VH crew. Van Helsing says she was the victim of a vampire and that the ringleader of the vampires must be killed for this chaos to end. They figure out it's Dracula, and after a heated battle, a stake is driven through Dracula's heart, thus putting an end to his terrorizing, and everybody else live happily ever after. (I'd like to thank my clearest source, the Mel Brooks film Dracula Dead and Loving It.) This film, directed by Francis Ford Coppola, succeeds in educating the audience about the mostly unmentioned, and therefore unknown, elements of the story, but its weakness of containing a mostly undevoted, undedicated, and cluelessly unaware cast damn near overpowers any knowledge that can be learned by having the audience focus on glaring errors rather than interesting tidbits.The most horrible work is brought to the table by that often-mocked thespian Keanu Reeves. The man of Whoa! plays Jonathan Harker, an Englishman who takes it upon himself to investigate Dracula's castle and is held captive for quite a while. Read that sentence again. Keanu Reeves plays an Englishman. Imagine Reeves not even trying to discipline his surfer ways and deliver lines in a British dialect. Now multiply that monstrosity by two, and you have his laughable performance. Still can't imagine it? Read this line aloud I've seen where the bawsterd sleeps! Also, I suppose out of fright and terror, Harker's hair turns white, which looks ridiculous with Reeves' golden tanned face. In Reeves' defense, I will say this These days, he has at least shown a little improvement in his movies since Dracula.To be blunt, the actors that disappointed me a bit more than Keanu were the dread pirate Cary Elwes (as one of three guys who wanted to get in bed with Lucy) and respected Oscar-winning thespian Sir Anthony Hopkins, who played Van Helsing. Before I dis Elwes' performance, I will say he has done much worse (see Saw), but Dracula is another example of his bad habit of overacting from time to time. Perhaps he was trying to upstage the other two horndogs after Lucy; ultimately, none of the three are interesting in the least. As for Hopkins, he disappoints his new found fans from his first go at Hannibal Lector by taking a juicy role like Van Helsing and sleep-acting throughout the film.The best performance of the film belongs to Gary Oldman (surprise, surprise) as the title role. His dialect actually sounds Transylvanian, as opposed to Bela Lugosi's more famous Hungarian dialect, and he brings the perfect doses of sensuality and blasphemous vengeance to the role. My favorite scene is in the beginning, when the not yet undead Dracula, a warrior returning from battle, finds his love (Winona Ryder, briefly playing Elisabeta) has committed suicide and takes the matter personally, in powerful anger, with God. Oldman, through an odd mix of hatred and sympathy, has the audience eating from the palm of his hand from that point on, and he delivers his tortured lines in another language! Watching the movie, I actually felt sorry that the phenomenal actor put more thought, research, and heart into the film than anybody else in the cast and the director did. Had this been a better movie, Oldman would have better roles on his resume and more nominations under his belt.Tom Waits, who plays bug-munching Renfield, is always delightfully mad fun, but I wish he had more scenes. As for Ryder, her Mina participates in some great seductive chemistry with Oldman, but her scenes with Keanu slump in appeal. Finally, Sadie Frost, who does a fine job of moaning, rubbing herself, and showing her bare chest as Lucy, would have had a great career in porn after this movie if she had pursued it - too bad I don't remember or recognize anything else she has done (I know, I know; she was married to Jude Law once. So what?).Oscars were received for the costumes and sound editing, and while the costumes were creative and colorful, they did not seem to match the realism the film was going for. The award-winning makeup for the vampires was absolutely astounding and reminded me of much later creatures made for the Lord of the Rings trilogy. On the other hand, to make the film all the more uneven, the visual effects and set design were sadly dated, relying on tricks from the '60s, like black silhouettes battling in front of a red-lit backdrop. Overall, the movie is heavily weighted down by its faults, but thanks to Oldman, this bat is still barely in flight.

But, I think there are some problems with the movie. I think I know why Mel Brooks had these problems He didn't want to do a straight re-enactment of scenes and characters from major science-fiction movies (mainly Star Wars)--with the exceptions of Dark Helmet, Dot Matrix, and Yogurt. He also didn't want to copy the costume look of any movie in particular (except with said exceptions). Some parodies are so slick that you'd think that the crew started shooting right after the genuine movie crew (or along side) but they're not that clever. However, that's where the problems arise When the scenes aren't based on the Tattooine planet or on board a starship, Mr. Brooks has a tough time getting the look right for a space movie. He also had costume problems. Again, it's doubtful that George Lucas would've let him borrow ship or costume designs (for the most part), and Mr. Brooks, probably, had a tough decision to choose between futuristic space or fake Star Wars costumes. So, basically, Lone Star wears a leather jacket and drives a Winnebago. Perhaps, a ship design that looked too closely like a Winnebago would've been better. There's also no space fight, and the music is a little flat. The genre Mr. Brooks is spoofing usually pays attention to the music. Joan Rivers doesn't have much room for her own jokes as Dot Matrix and Barfolomew--Barf is kind of a wasted gag for John Candy's character. Having said that, the movie is very funny, and you can't wait to find out what dumb thing the Spaceballs are going to do next. Rick Moranis brought his 'A' game as Dark Helmet--in fact the best scenes involve the Spaceballs. Yogurt does a fine send-up of the whole Lucasfilm Ltd. world, and I also enjoy John Hurt's cameo. Mel Brooks may have problems with outer space fiction, but Spaceballs still proves that he knows comedy.

Most would say that some foreign film that nobody has ever heard of is the best. Though I had several film courses on a university level, I don't consider myself some scholar. I like what I like. My DVD collection is filled with Criterion titles and foreign films which I love, but it somehow all comes back to Rocky. It is one cliché after another, but it's brilliant in it's simplicity. How can you not root for this underdog? People say how stupid Rocky is, that he's an oaf, etc. Rocky ISN'T supposed to be some nuclear physicist, he's just a down on his luck, poorly educated boxer with a big heart. Take the sequence when he goes on his first date with Adrian. They are both nervous as nervous can be, but as we watch, they slowly start to open up to each other. A great example of this is when they're at the ice skating rink. The way they communicate and laugh is fantastic, one of the most real scenes I have ever seen in movie. Adrian says Why do you fight?, Rocky says Because I can't sing and dance.. EXACTLY. The dialogue is crisp, they say exactly what they should say in that situation. Look at the ending, the scene where the winner is decided is a mere two second shot. Rocky isn't even paying attention, he's looking for Adrian. The scene where she's standing in the tunnel and starts to run to the ring after the fight still gets me misty after all these years (and I know I'm not the only one who gets like that!). This is a film about inspiration and not backing down. When Rocky gets up after the 14th round, his right eye swollen shut, his face looking like it was run over by a truck, he never backs down. He gestures to Apollo, as if saying Come on, bring it.. Apollo just shakes his head. Apollo may know he has already won the match, but Rocky won it all. He won self respect, the respect of Mickey, the respect of the country, and the love of Adrian.

","genre":"Drama, Sport"},{"date":"23 August 2006","score":"","review":" I know, I know, most people yawn when they hear about the next Rocky sequel, but these movies stand the test of time. The first Rocky movie, in my opinion is one of the greatest movies of the past 35 years. All those film students out there will be up in arms saying that is not possible. Most would say that some foreign film that nobody has ever heard of is the best. Though I had several film courses on a university level, I don't consider myself some scholar. I like what I like. My DVD collection is filled with Criterion titles and foreign films which I love, but it somehow all comes back to Rocky. It is one cliché after another, but it's brilliant in it's simplicity. How can you not root for this underdog? People say how stupid Rocky is, that he's an oaf, etc. Rocky ISN'T supposed to be some nuclear physicist, he's just a down on his luck, poorly educated boxer with a big heart. Take the sequence when he goes on his first date with Adrian. They are both nervous as nervous can be, but as we watch, they slowly start to open up to each other. A great example of this is when they're at the ice skating rink. The way they communicate and laugh is fantastic, one of the most real scenes I have ever seen in movie. Adrian says Why do you fight?, Rocky says Because I can't sing and dance.. EXACTLY. The dialogue is crisp, they say exactly what they should say in that situation. Look at the ending, the scene where the winner is decided is a mere two second shot. Rocky isn't even paying attention, he's looking for Adrian. The scene where she's standing in the tunnel and starts to run to the ring after the fight still gets me misty after all these years (and I know I'm not the only one who gets like that!). This is a film about inspiration and not backing down. When Rocky gets up after the 14th round, his right eye swollen shut, his face looking like it was run over by a truck, he never backs down. He gestures to Apollo, as if saying Come on, bring it.. Apollo just shakes his head. Apollo may know he has already won the match, but Rocky won it all. He won self respect, the respect of Mickey, the respect of the country, and the love of Adrian. I've started jogging in the past few months and every time I'm at the park I try to push myself a little bit further. A film like Rocky shows us that we can all go the extra mile. This is a great film and not to be missed.

Annie Hall is one of what I regard as Woody Allen's five truly great films, the others being (in chronological order) Love and Death, Manhattan, Hannah and Her Sisters and Crimes and Misdemeanours. If Manhattan is Allen's most penetrating analysis of human relationships, and Crimes and Misdemeanours is his film with the greatest philosophical depth, then Annie Hall must surely be his funniest. It has a script that is sparklingly witty even by Woody's standards, containing such classic Woodyisms as I was thrown out of N.Y.U. my freshman year for cheating on my metaphysics final, you know, I looked within the soul of the boy sitting next to me and the unforgettable Don't knock masturbation. It's sex with someone I love.Like Manhattan, Annie Hall is a study of relationships set among New York's bohemian classes, but is simpler in its structure. Whereas Manhattan was centred around a sort of eternal quadrangle that at times threatened to become a pentagon or even hexagon, Annie Hall is very much based on the relationship between one man and one woman. It is probably Woody's most autobiographical film. His character is named Alvy Singer; the name Alvy, short for Alvin, was probably chosen because of its closeness to Allen. Diane Keaton, who was his real-life girlfriend at this time, plays Alvy's lover, Annie Hall. (Hall is Keaton's real surname). Like Woody, Alvy is a Jewish New York comedian. Like Keaton, Annie is a Gentile, originally from the Mid-West, and is working in New York as an actress and singer.As is normal in Woody's films, the two main characters are very different. Alvy is the typical neurotic Allen intellectual, meeting every situation with angst-ridden humour. Like many Allen characters he can be described as passive-aggressive, but perhaps with less passivity and more aggressiveness than most. (Annie and his other girlfriends frequently characterise him as hostile). Annie is both more extrovert and more easygoing, and Alvy often envies her more relaxed attitude. Keaton, in what was probably her best performance in a distinguished career, plays her with great naturalness and charm; her Best Actress Oscar was well-deserved.The plot is a simple one; it chronicles the development of Alvy and Annie's affair from their first meeting to their eventual break-up. (Alvy compares their relationship to a shark which dies if it cannot keep going forward). Annie then becomes involved with a Hollywood producer and Alvy travels to California to see if he can win her back. (Woody clearly does not care much for California in general and Los Angeles in particular; the film contains some of his most barbed contributions to the East Coast\/West Coast culture wars, along the lines of I don't want to move to a city where the only cultural advantage is being able to make a right turn on a red light.) The simplicity of the plot, however, does not mean that this is a simple film. The story of Annie and Alvy's relationship is told in a non-linear manner with numerous flashbacks, including some to Alvy's two earlier marriages. Woody also makes very effective use of such devices as a split screen (in order to show Annie and Alvy simultaneously when they are not together) and subtitles (in order to show how his characters' true feelings do not match their words). There is even a brief cartoon sequence.Annie Hall was, of course, the film that beat Star Wars to the Best Picture Oscar, something that was very controversial even at the time. Woody himself won Best Director ahead of George Lucas. Like any film lover I frequently have my disagreements with the Academy (such as when they failed even to nominate Manhattan in 1980) but I have to say that 1978 was one year when they got things completely right. I have nothing in particular against Star Wars itself, which is a well-made and entertaining science-fiction adventure, although I do dislike some of its sequels and the quasi-religious cult which has grown up around it. Annie Hall, however, is far superior in its script, its characterisation, its acting and in its innovative techniques. Star Wars is superior only in its special effects, and the day when the Academy starts handing out Best Picture awards on the basis of special effects alone will be a sad one for the cinema.The irony is that Woody Allen probably appreciated his Oscar far less than George Lucas would have done if he had won. He famously absented himself from the ceremony, preferring to attend his regular jazz session instead, and the film itself contains some satire at the expense of such prizes. (What's with all these awards? They're always giving out awards. Best Fascist Dictator Adolf Hitler.). In a sense, however, Oscars do not just belong to those who win them.

He famously absented himself from the ceremony, preferring to attend his regular jazz session instead, and the film itself contains some satire at the expense of such prizes. (What's with all these awards? They're always giving out awards. Best Fascist Dictator Adolf Hitler.). In a sense, however, Oscars do not just belong to those who win them. They also belong to all those who appeared in or worked on the film and, in a wider sense, to all those who love it. On behalf of all those who, like me, admire Annie Hall and Woody's work in general, I hereby thank the Academy. 10\/10 ","genre":"Comedy, Romance"},{"date":"23 August 2006","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Jason X is basically the same as the nine previous Friday the 13th movies, except that Jason has been resurrected from cryogenics in the year 2455, and is going on a rampage on a spaceship instead of Camp Crystal Lake.

","genre":"Comedy, Musical"},{"date":"23 August 2006","score":"","review":" Bottom lineThis is a preposterous, ridiculous, and absolutely unrealistic action film. Bottom lineIt's VERY, VERY entertaining action film which never lets you catch a breath. If you try and read the realism of an action film which has Arnold just dodge a damaged wing propeller of an airplane, will himself to a falling parachute pack, shoot out the windshield of said airplane while it is flying towards him, dodge hitting the plane again as it drifts away when bullets blow holes and intense air into the pilots' face, get his parachute all tangled around his legs, unwind the tangled parachute, loose that parachute, but unearth the emergency parachute, and finally land on a junkyard car bending the entire top, yet barely bat an eyelash. Okay, have I made that pretty clear. The film takes..umm..liberties with the limits of what one man is able to do. Arnold Schwarzenegger plays US Marshal John Kruger..a man who erases the identities of people under the special witness program. We see his impressive work early as he rescues Johnny Castelone(Robert Pastorelli, who is very funny)and his wife from certain death at the hands of gangsters working for a mob boss he plan to squeal on. We watch him defuse the situation rather easily. He's good at his job and shows that this kind of operation, if placed in the trustworthy hands of Kruger, that a person can escape possible doom. He receives a new person to relocate..Lee Cullen(the always beautiful Vanessa Williams), a woman who uncovers the plans of her company, Cyrez, in the possible sell of military hi-tech weaponry). Kruger's boss, Chief Beller(James Coburn), informs him that there are some high-level people that will be effected greatly by Lee's witnessing at a trial in regards to her Defense Corporation, Cyrez. We soon discover that even the Undersecretary of Defense Daniel Harper(Andy Romano)is a major player in arms selling. But, nothing would prepare Kruger for the ultimate betrayal of his mentor, US Marshal Robert Deguerin(James Caan), who is behind the works of getting the operation all set up and balanced without complications. Deguerin, unfortunately, isn't able to finish off Kruger in the plane(he needed him to guide them to Lee)and creates some real trouble to his almost too smooth plans in setting up the selling of a major load of state-of-the-art, electromagnetic rifles for $52 million. The problem Kruger faces is not only keeping Lee alive but convincing Beller that Deguerin is the mole of WITSEC(the official name of the witness protection program Kruger works for). The film shows countless scenarios where by all true rights, Kruger would never make it out alive. Every time the screenplay stacks the deck, Kruger superhumanly brings himself out safely. The film provides some real humdingers in the way of complications..there is an unlimited supply of dead meat for Deguerin to send into the grinder to kill Kruger. Check out the most famous scene, in the zoo sequence where Kruger shoots out the alligator tank and these reptiles eat several men trying to kill them. In a ball-busting escape from an alligator, Kruger shoots it in the mouth and proclaims, You're luggage. The film has lots of fast-moving chases where we ponder momentarily how Kruger and Lee will ever accomplish their mountainous goals of taking down the evil corruption of those willing to sell weaponry to a dangerous terrorist. I liked how Kruger uses Castelone to get into the Cyrez building to access information about what is on the disc that she copied at the beginning of the film that got her into such trouble to start with. I thought the entire sequence was unbelievable, but so is the rest of the film so why quarrel with such things. Ultimately, the film is a cat-and-mouse between teacher and student. Kruger has to find ways to outsmart the man that taught him all the ways of being an Eraser. So it's up to the two of them in understanding how each others' mind works to determine how thee whole difficult situation will be played out. The film is never boring, always on the run with few chances to unleash those horrible moments of characterization. All we need is the non-stop, jaw dropping, exhausting action to keep out heads from towering over in sleepy slumber. This delivers, though, what it sets out for..it is a blast to watch even if you don't believe a bit of it. ","genre":null},{"date":"23 August 2006","score":"","review":" Bottom lineThis is a preposterous, ridiculous, and absolutely unrealistic action film. Bottom lineIt's VERY, VERY entertaining action film which never lets you catch a breath. If you try and read the realism of an action film which has Arnold just dodge a damaged wing propeller of an airplane, will himself to a falling parachute pack, shoot out the windshield of said airplane while it is flying towards him, dodge hitting the plane again as it drifts away when bullets blow holes and intense air into the pilots' face, get his parachute all tangled around his legs, unwind the tangled parachute, loose that parachute, but unearth the emergency parachute, and finally land on a junkyard car bending the entire top, yet barely bat an eyelash. Okay, have I made that pretty clear. The film takes..umm..liberties with the limits of what one man is able to do. Arnold Schwarzenegger plays US Marshal John Kruger..a man who erases the identities of people under the special witness program. We see his impressive work early as he rescues Johnny Castelone(Robert Pastorelli, who is very funny)and his wife from certain death at the hands of gangsters working for a mob boss he plan to squeal on. We watch him defuse the situation rather easily. He's good at his job and shows that this kind of operation, if placed in the trustworthy hands of Kruger, that a person can escape possible doom. He receives a new person to relocate..Lee Cullen(the always beautiful Vanessa Williams), a woman who uncovers the plans of her company, Cyrez, in the possible sell of military hi-tech weaponry). Kruger's boss, Chief Beller(James Coburn), informs him that there are some high-level people that will be effected greatly by Lee's witnessing at a trial in regards to her Defense Corporation, Cyrez. We soon discover that even the Undersecretary of Defense Daniel Harper(Andy Romano)is a major player in arms selling. But, nothing would prepare Kruger for the ultimate betrayal of his mentor, US Marshal Robert Deguerin(James Caan), who is behind the works of getting the operation all set up and balanced without complications. Deguerin, unfortunately, isn't able to finish off Kruger in the plane(he needed him to guide them to Lee)and creates some real trouble to his almost too smooth plans in setting up the selling of a major load of state-of-the-art, electromagnetic rifles for $52 million. The problem Kruger faces is not only keeping Lee alive but convincing Beller that Deguerin is the mole of WITSEC(the official name of the witness protection program Kruger works for). The film shows countless scenarios where by all true rights, Kruger would never make it out alive. Every time the screenplay stacks the deck, Kruger superhumanly brings himself out safely.
