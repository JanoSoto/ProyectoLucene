Their performance in Alice Springs wins no prizes but Weaving acquires the cheerfully accepting wife and son he'd left behind, and Stamp can quit worrying about wrinkles because he's found a nice, good-natured bloke to settle down with.I'd imagine that one of the problems in making (or appreciating) a movie like this is what you do after the initial shock of seeing three guys prance around in fancy costumes wears off. Stephen Elliott, the writer\/director, has generally gotten past the problem. The three guys are soon individualized. Weaver is the anxious, uncertain guy with the odd ball eyebrows. Pearce is flamboyant and chipper. Stamp is somber and worried about what will happen now that his looks have faded.But turning three fairies into persons is the easy part. The Boys In The Band did it with a snap of the fingers. The tough part is laying out a story with some substance to it. Otherwise the viewer is liable to be bored listening to the bitchy insults and improbable displays. Elliott and the cast give the story just enough juice to get us all through it happily, aided immeasurably by the incandescent magnificence of the Australian outback. You have never seen such sere and blasted vistas. Well, not since Lawrence of Arabia.What really worried me was that this effervescent flick would turn serious in the end -- sentimental and sloppy.

Their act consists of appearing on stage in kaleidoscopically gaudy outfits and make up and making believe they are singing and dancing to a recorded song. The songs aren't bad, by the way. You won't get boiler maker's gap from listening to disco or pop songs from the 40s. Stamp and his frown look completely out of place under a mop of plastic hair. His settling down was little loss to the act. Weaving doesn't look bad as a prismatically groomed young woman. And Pearce doesn't look bad at all until you get down to the muscles, which remind you that he is a more slender simulacrum of Arnold Schwarzenegger.

Wilson from source stories by Ian Fleming. It stars Roger Moore, Carole Bouquet, Julian Glover, Topol, Michael Gothard and Jill Bennett. Music is scored by Bill Conti and cinematography by Alan Hume.Bond 12 and 007 is assigned to locate the whereabouts of the ATAC, a secret device that transmits orders to Polaris carrying submarines. He must do so quickly because the Soviets are also in pursuit, and they appear to be aided by a wealthy shipping magnate.In spite of the gargantuan box office garnered by Moonraker, Albert Broccoli was hurt by criticism that it had strayed too far from the basic 007 formula. Making good on his word to get Bond back to reality, he mostly succeeded in making For Your Eyes Only a stripped back thriller. Gone is the over reliance on hi-tech wizardry, Moore (in his best performance as Bond) is back to being down to earth, being a Bond using his wits and toughness to get out of tricky situations, and the film goes for short sharp shock action scenes instead of giant battles enveloped by even bigger sets. There's much tension as well, none more so than with the finale, where again the big bang pyrotechnics have been replaced by a mountain peak accent and assault; where Bond uses a boot lace to save his skin! Now that's the Bond we love and admire. We even get the return of a bit of flirting between Moneypenny (Lois Maxwell) and Bond, while Q (Desmond Llewelyn) is on witty form.Characters are strong, a major plus point in the film. Topol (charismatic and on scene stealing form) and Glover offer up fascinating characters, with Glover excellent as Kristatos, providing the franchise with a cultured and believable villain. Melina Havelock (Bouquet convincing) is tough and driven by revenge for her murdered parents, adept with a crossbow she makes a sturdy accomplice for Bond, and thankfully their union isn't bogged down mid mission by the between the sheets angle. Elsewhere, 007 editor John Glenn directs the first of his 5 Bond movies, impressive first outing with the underwater scenes particularly striking. Hume brings Corfu to life via his colour lenses and Conti oversees one of the series' best title theme songs, song with deep emotional beauty by Sheena Easton. His overall score is merely adequate, with decent nationalistic flavours, but the theme song is so strong it lingers to this day in the memory of all Bond fans.It's not all great in this stripped back Bond world, though. The pre-credits sequence makes the terrible mistake of negating Bond's visit to the grave of his late wife, Tracy, by then having him jostle and jape with a bald villain in a wheelchair (is it meant to be Blofeld?) with unconvincing lines and delivery in the mix as well. Lynn-Holly Johnson's Bibi Dahl character is as pointless as it gets, out of place and superfluous to the plot. While some chase sequences, as fun and pulse raising as they are, are over extended and stretch the running time to longer than required. No mind, though, with Bond back to being a man again instead of a button pusher, and brilliant scenes like the keel-hauling peril, For Your Eyes Only was a major hit that raked in over $195 million at the World box office. James Bond's appeal, and that of the man playing him, was very much in vogue. 8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"14 June 2012","score":"6 out of 7 people found the following review useful","review":" For Your Eyes Only is directed by John Glen and adapted to screenplay by Richard Maibaum and Michael G.

While some chase sequences, as fun and pulse raising as they are, are over extended and stretch the running time to longer than required. No mind, though, with Bond back to being a man again instead of a button pusher, and brilliant scenes like the keel-hauling peril, For Your Eyes Only was a major hit that raked in over $195 million at the World box office. James Bond's appeal, and that of the man playing him, was very much in vogue. 8\/10 ","genre":"Action, Adventure, Thriller"},{"date":"14 June 2012","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Greetings again from the darkness. Often cited as one of the all-time great films, I was fortunate enough to catch this one again in a limited theatrical release ... a staggeringly beautiful and crisp print. The look of the film is so clear it looks new, and the updated subtitles make sense and are easy to read. As amazing as it looks, the real value is in the film itself.Directed by the great Jean Renoir, the story takes place during WWI and shows a much different viewpoint than what we would normally expect from a war movie. But then, this is not really a war movie ... or a POW movie ... or a Political statement. The real core of this story is the respect and gentlemanly nature exhibited by the men from opposing sides of the war. It is a reminder that war itself is the grand illusion. We also see the results of class differences. When German pilot von Rauffenstein shoots down a couple of French planes, he tells the recovery team to invite them to lunch if they are officers. And then we see the similarities of the aristocratic officers as von Rauffenstein and Captain de Boeldieu discover their common bonds.The influence of this film is quite obvious in two scenes. The digging of the escape tunnel and subsequent emptying of pockets on the prison grounds were borrowed in The Great Escape. Also, the singing of La Marseilles to annoy the Germans was used quite effectively in Casablanca. We also see a quite daring bedside death scene with the pure admiration between opposing officers who decide dying in war is a good way out for their types. Powerful stuff. There is also much commentary on differences aristocrats, working class, Jewish, Germans, and career soldiers. We even see cross-dressing (with a purpose) in a couple of scenes, one of which provides an unforgettable visual as the soldiers sing It's a Long Way to Tipperary.As great as the movie is, the backstory is almost as fascinating. Released as WWII was brewing, it was one of the first things Goebbels seized when the Germans took France. The original negative was shipped to Berlin and presumed destroyed. However, it ended up in Russian archives and was re-discovered in the 1990's. This was after Renoir attempted restoration from numerous copies in the 1960's. Unfortunately, he did not live to see this most recent restoration that brought the film back to it's original glory. Renoir's camera work is something to behold - subtle movements for extended shots. By the way, Jean Renoir is the son of the famous French Impressionist Pierre-Auguste Renoir. I believe they call that good genes.Silent film director Erich von Stroheim's iconic turn as von Rauffenstein is truly movie magic. You will recognize von Stroheim as the man servant in Sunset Boulevard. Boeldieu is played by Pierre Fresnay, Marechal is played by Jean Gabin, and Rosenthal by Marcel Dalio. Marechal and Rosenthal have a remarkable segment at Elsa's farm house. Elsa is played by the stunning Dita Parlo. This sequence provides a nice contrast to the POW portions of the film.This work of art is now 75 years old. It is highly recommended that you see it at least once. Also, check out Renoir's other masterpiece The Rules of the Game.

It's an extremely difficult one to rate because like Stephen King's Thinner critically it deserves a categoric 1\/10 for it being absolutely one of the worst films I've ever seen in terms of acting, screenplay, directing, special effects etc. However, we've all heard of the old cliché 'it's so bad it's good' and this directly applies to Freddy's Dead. I had an absolute ball watching this film and it had me in stitches from start to finish.Freddy's Dead features some of the worst deaths imaginable. And I don't mean that in a gruesome way, I mean that in a really crazy\/weak idea way! I mean Freddy playing with a deaf boys hearing is pretty un-PC in the first place, but the way it's executed is one of the funniest things I've ever seen! Why would dropping a pin from a great height onto metal be something torturous? It only gets worse when Freddy begins to claw a chalk board with his iconic knife hand! It is brilliant. It only gets funnier when a boy is transported into some sort of Sega video game which Freddy controls. You can only imagine how bad that turns out.However, these death scenes actually become something truly memorable because of how unintentionally hilariously bad they are! All of the characters are completely wooden and the script is one of the cheesiest things I've heard. The directing is equally as awful and the dream sequences are completely incomprehensible, it is literally impossible to tell what is going on. It doesn't help by the horrendously awful special effects that resemble something more from the early 60's than 90's! Some of the animation is absolutely atrocious, as is the make-up effects. The original's effects were far better than this! The final showdown is equally as terrible. It's such a pathetic fight scene, I can't believe they even bothered to film it! Although it doesn't help that Freddy has been camper than ever screaming lines such as You give it back you bitch! and giving pathetic punches to his own daughter. The screenplay also decides to break its own rules throughout to which you just have to let it go and enjoy the entertaining mess which caresses your screen.It's obvious from the ending that the film makers really did want this to be the final sequel, but thank God it wasn't! Because what a terrible end for someone as iconic as Freddy. The writing is so lazy that it decides to take the ideas from the first film about killing Freddy, only this time it works. It's awful. Luckily when Wes Craven came in for a new sequel with New Nightmare it was actually a really good film, the final Freddy film to date Freddy Vs Jason was also a particularly fun instalment. So Freddy isn't dead, but a horrendously bad sequel lives on. I laughed until my sides hurt, but you might react differently. My advice is to take it as it comes!

It showed the future of space travel to standards of people who just found out about space travel. The lead character is played by Sigourney Weaver who played in all three sequels of Alien and has also plays Dr. Grace Augustine in Avatar. These sequels are Aliens, Alien 3 and Alien. In each of these films Sigourney Weaver is the only recurring character which fights for survival and tries to keep the alien from getting back to Earth. However she didn't play in the two prequels Alien vs. Predator and Aliens vs. Predator Requiem. Ridley Scott has directed many other movies of which the most recent one is Prometheus.Alien starts with a true Star Wars beginning, a big view of outer space and one small spaceship approaching. This spaceship is the Nostromo coming home from a mining expedition for the Company. The crew of the ship is in a hibernation state when the ship's main computer answer a distress signal coming from a nearby planet. The crew sets out to find the source of the signal because they are supposed to react to a possible life form and bring it home to planet Earth. After bringing in the alien and accidentally letting it escapes. This result in a fight for survival while they are being hunted down one by one. This makes it a typical thriller movie.The setting of the movie is has been chosen really well, both the Nostromo spaceship and the alien spaceship feel like a real spaceship. However since this movie was made during a time when technology was still developing, this causes a lot of old effects in the movie. For example the instrument panel contained a lot of blinking lights and weird buttons which look really childish. This childish effect makes the technological aspects of the ship look very cheap. They even had to use children to play scene where they needed a bigger set than they could afford. These children did a great job playing the astronauts.Throughout the movie music plays an important role to create suspense. In a thriller movie this is very important because if you play a child's song during an attack of the alien you will not be scared, but you will laugh at the alien. The music is able to create suspense or make the actors move quickly. This makes you feel like the alien is also right behind you and it makes you want to run away as quickly as possible.A movie is not just about how the movie is edited, but mainly if the actors are able to convince the audience that their fear or joy is real. In this movie the different type of actors create a perfect mix to make everyone have one person to relate to. The character of Lambert played by Veronica Cartwright is the type of person that is scared of everything. She does this very well and her screams sound real and convincing. One of her screams is in fact real, because the director did one scene without telling the actors exactly what was going to happen. Then during the filming when the unexpected explosion of blood occurred she almost fainted because of fear, but luckily the rest of the actors stayed in their role while being scared at the same time by the blood. This created a true illusion of fear.In this movie costume design is very important. The costume for the alien, the space suits for both the children and adults and the normal day clothes had to be made to perfectly match the scene of the movie. The alien's costume was very difficult to make because they wanted to create something that did not look like a humanoid alien. They were not very successful at this, but through using other techniques like camera work they were able to compensate for this problem. The spacesuits of both the children and the adults were other big problems because of the high temperature and the lack of oxygen in the suit. This was major concern because the people in the suits would only be able to perform for a short while in the suits without fainting. In the end the costumes look great in the movie.In a movie where not everything is perfect camera work is very important. This is because the camera is able to make things look different than they really are. The camera work in this movie is used very effectively. This is most noticeable in the scene with the children. They used a different distance than they normally would use to create an effect where everything looked bigger than it was in reality. Also in the close encounters with the alien the camera is never pointed directly at the alien to make the humanoid features of the alien less noticeable.Overall the movie is a good combination of different techniques. The use of special effect was outstanding when the movie was first made, but nowadays the special effects look really normal and sometimes even old. However if you look through these special effects you will see a terrifying movie which shows a possible future of space travel which we are still not capable of nowadays. The actors did a very great job in transferring their fear towards the audience.

In John Hughes 1985 drama, The Breakfast Club, five high school students meet in Saturday detention. The brainy Brian Johnson (Anthony Michael Hall), the princess, Claire Standish (Molly Ringwald), the criminal, John Bender (Judd Nelson), the athlete, Andrew Clark (Emilio Estevez), and Allison Reynolds, the basket case (Ally Sheedy). From seven in the morning to four in the afternoon the teenagers delve into their problems at home and prove that they're bigger than their respective stereotypes, while trying to evade their villainous principal, Richard Vernon (Paul Gleason). At the beginning of the movie Andrew and John immediately go at it after John mocks him and Brian, and sexually harasses Claire. Gradually the group begins to open up to each other, revealing that they all have unpleasant relationships with their parents. Andrew's father wants him to be a winner, and won't take anything less. Claire's parents use her to get back at one another, while Allison's parents ignore her. John's life at home is full of violence and rage. Brian is seen as the perfect kid, but he is under intense pressure to keep his grades up. The teenagers are then shown together, dancing all over the library, their stereotypes no longer holding them back from one another. The movie has amazing dialog that plays a large part in setting up the characters and gives the movie verisimilitude. Claire (Ringwald) tells Vernon (Gleason) at the beginning of the movie Excuse me sir, I think there's been a mistake. I know it's detention, but I don't think I belong in here. This simple line has a subtle snobby air about it, with a slight hint that she thinks she's better than the people she's with, that the audience can relate to hearing with the own popular kids in their school. When Vernon asks if the kids care to return to detention Brian (Hall) stands up and says Uh, you know I can answer that now sir. That'd be a no, no for me. Being the nerd, this line makes it look like Brian is trying to get on Vernon's good side, which is stereotypical of the nerd type, always being the teachers favorite. Bender's (Nelson) dialog in the movie is constantly sarcastic and mocking, which makes the audience believe that he really is the one kid that doesn't care about school and is always getting into some sort of trouble. An example of this is when he asks Vernon Does Barry Manilow know that you raid his wardrobe? This quote makes people think back to the dropout or burner they knew in high school, the one who was always getting into some sort of trouble. The same type of verisimilitude is given off when Andrew, the jock (Estevez), tells Brian You ask me one more question and I'm beating the sh*t out of you. This line shows the typical jock, the one that uses his fists to settle things and scare people. Another wonderful aspect of the movie is the costume design for the characters. The costume design seems to fit perfectly to the type of stereotype each of the actors is playing. Allison (Sheedy), the basket case, is wearing something that looks like bag lady clothes. She has on really baggy clothes that are dark colors. Her hair is slightly disheveled and she has very dark eyeliner. Her clothes make her blend into the background, which adds to her being a sort of recluse. Claire looks like the standard rich prep, with an expensive leather jacket and diamond earrings. Her makeup is light and pretty and she has a sort of innocent look about her. She looks very put together with a skirt and a light pink shirt paired with boots. The audience can tell that she definitely comes from a family that has money. Bender, the criminal, has a grungy look to him. He has an overcoat, leather biker gloves, with black combat boots that have bandannas tied around them. He has a jean jacket over a half unbuttoned plaid shirt. His hair is long and carefree. He looks like someone you wouldn't want to mess with. Brian looks like a typical nerd. He has a respectable haircut with khakis and a green sweater. He has an air of innocence while you know that he's the one sitting in the front of the class hanging onto the teacher's every word. The jock, Andrew, comes in with his wrestling letterman jacket on, displaying loudly and proudly that he is an athlete. Under that he just wears jeans with a muscle shirt, showing off his toned biceps. All of the costumes pull together, yet while being completely different at the same time. Overall, this film is one of my favorite films of all time, and was an instant hit with me. I loved the witty dialog, the characters, the setting, everything. The one aspect that really stuck with me was how I could completely relate to almost every character in the film, knowing at least one person who acted in the exact same manner. I would definitely recommend this film to anyone who is in high school, or who has ever been in high school. On my list, The Breakfast Club will always be a 10 out of 10.

Fargo is a 1996 American dark comedy-crime film produced, directed and written by brothers Joel and Ethan Coen. It stars Frances McDormand as a pregnant(?) police chief who investigates a series of homicides, William H. Macy as a car salesman who hires two criminals to kidnap his wife, Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare as the criminals, and Harve Presnell as the salesman's father-in-law.The film earned seven Academy Award nominations, winning two for Best Original Screenplay for the Coens and Best Actress in a Leading Role for McDormand. It also won the BAFTA Award and the Award for Best Director for Joel Coen at the 1996 Cannes Film Festival.Fargo opens with a title card proclaiming This is a true story. The events depicted in this film took place in Minnesota in 1987. Earnest journalists who went in search of the real woodchipper murders were outraged when, after months of wild goose chases and increasingly deadpan obfuscation by the film-makers, they finally admitted that the title card was actually an elaborate hoax - their way of poking a hole in the true story balloon, according to William H Macy.So Fargo was not, in fact, based on a true story. None of it really happened. There is no real Jerry Lundegaard out there. Back to the film William H. Macy is the best actor in this film, closely followed by my favorite Steve Buscemi. Peter Stormare complements him well in his role as the murderous Gaear Grimsrud. Not to forget the awesome cameos by Steve Reevis as Native American ex-convict Shep Proudfoot.The person I hate in this film is Frances McDormand(Darkman). This b*tch has no acting talent whatsoever and spoils the mood of the film. In this film you will hear her (and some of her buddies) repeating a common phrase OH YAH! OH YAH! YAH! YAH! This gets on your nerves after a while.One thing makes me wonder how the hell can a PREGNANT local police chief be allowed to work during her pregnancy? This part I DO NOT AGREE ON.The core of the film is based on a botched up kidnapping which affects the lives of many persons. The motive for the kidnapping is money (a.k.a. GREED). Greedy persons in the film are Jerry Lundegaard, an indebted car dealer who hires two men to kidnap his wife. Carl Showalter, a small-time crook hired to kidnap Jerry's wife and his psychotic partner Gaear Grimsrud.Best scenes in the film Shep beating Carl & Carl getting mince-meated during the films end.This is for me the 2nd best film by the Coen Brothers, the best or 1st ranking Coen Brothers film for me is No Country For Old Men.
