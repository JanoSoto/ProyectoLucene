[{"date":"1 October 2009","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Cure (1997) (By Kiyoshi Kurosawa)This was a good forerunner to the films of the modern Asian horror bloom. A bleak and creepy detective horror. Sometimes it's a bit odd, with seemingly happy music playing in scenes you would associate with deep sadness or pain. And the director has a certain feeling for details that you would not expect to find in such a film, at times giving what would otherwise be very ordinary scenes a special meaning. For example when our main character takes a simple buss-ride to visit the mental hospital. It is subtle, but the way the clouds are made, as seen in the back windows of the bus, among other things, perfectly conveys the feeling of a soothing, almost a tad dreamlike journey - as a momentary break on a doomed and hopeless day... But most of the time it plays like any Asian horror film, only this one is very dark. When you watch it it's like you are helplessly confined within it's universe and there is nothing to do but submit to it and follow the story. This is why it's uncomfortable even though it's relatively light on horror or true dread, and it reminds me a lot of Kairo for this reason.In passing, the ideas and themes that it explores poses questions about our inner nature, and not least the nature of morality. It's intriguing and creepy at the same time, even if things can get a bit confusing - and i find that the film plays a lot in the dark so that can contribute to that effect as well - but hey, what Asian horror movies doesn't get a little weird? Anyway, you always roughly understand what happens however so it's no big deal.The murders are gruesome but pretty schematic. Without them it would hardly be the kind of film it is, but I feel that most of the tension in the movie derives from its main character (the detective) and his inner frustration, as well as from the psycho(really the mysterious Mr. X) which is the suspect he interrogates. The detective's life is a mess, his wife and love suffers from mental illness, and his job doesn't make it easy for him as it is. Be sure that the overly intelligent, illusive bad guy takes advantage of as much as he can of this. He frustrates and manipulates, but with a power over people that even Hannibal Lecter cannot compete with. But the film isn't about getting someone convicted. It explores the inexplainable, incurable evil that cannot be undone. The ending is ambiguous and we don't exactly know if things will sort out now or what will happen.A very good, dark crime horror from Kurosawa. Maybe you could call it horror for grownups? Very recommended, but expect a very slow-paced and meditative film.
