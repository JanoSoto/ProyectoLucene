These days there aren't many thrillers that have the balls to be different. With the exception of the masterpiece Mulholland Drive and The Salton Sea most thrillers are pretty standard. Mostly the story line involves a protagonist who is searching for a faceless antagonist because they have committed a crime or for other personal reasons. That said I have just described the story behind Memento. Now just hear me out because I am anything but a hypocrite. Leonard is trying to hunt down the person who raped and murdered his wife. During his investigated two people fade in and out of his mind (Teddy and Natalie) faster than he can even process. Neither of them clam to know the other but they sure seem to know a lot about each other, both are also very suspicious characters in a world where no one can be trusted. But this film has one twist that will make this film genius to some and unbearable to others. The twist is that Leonard has a condition that allows him to remember everything up to the death of his wife but can't create any new memories. It is like every time Leonard opens his eyes a whole new world has been crated around him. He knows who he is but not what he has become. He knows what he is doing but not whom he is doing it for. Now you are probably wondering how a simple characteristic like short-term memory loss makes a film unbearable to some. This is where director Christopher Nolan comes into play. Nolan has decided to take a simple concept and tell it in one of the most original fashions I have seen in a film noir. He allows the entire film to unfold backwards! We open the film with a scene showing Leonard killing the man he thinks responsible for the death of his wife. We then move back in time to see how he came to the opening scene (the ending). Instead of giving the audience a situation and letting them figure out the mystery, Nolan has give us the conclusion and the basic story elements and lets the audience figure out if Leonard's actions are justified. Another interesting concept is that whenever a scene ends by meeting where the previous one started we cut to a black and white scene showing Leonard in an anonymous room, taking an anonymous phone call. He tells the caller of his days when he had to investigate a man named Sammy Jankis who suffered from the same condition as him. This is where the film gets tricky. See the black and white scenes provide a means of characterization and basic insight into what is, has and will happen to Leonard in colour. It also lets us understand Leonard's condition more thoroughly to strengthen the plot immensely with the audience even knowing. The thing that makes these scenes tricky is that while the one in colour run backwards, the black and white ones run forward in time until the finally meet at the end to provide a whole new light on everything. This is a very impressive piece of work for a first time director such as Nolan who also wrote the script. He makes everything seem visually stunning without the use of any special effects or trickery. He also creates a world where everything said and done is significant to the films outcome. If you don't pay attention to something because you think it isn't important or is boring than you may as well stop watching because everything that the eye can see is important to take in. Nolan also keeps everything thought provoking and edgy at all times. There is not one moment in this film that allows you to stop thinking and take a break. Nolan hardly gives you enough time to even blink and even the lighter scenes in the film have an eerily suspenseful ness to them. There are also some bits of dark humour thrown in but instead of being a break from the tension they only maximize it. To me this humour came off as a dead irony and just helped build onto Leonard's character. Both Carrie-Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano give great performances as Teddy and Natalie but it is Guy Pearce as Leonard who gives a career making performance. Never once did he allow anyone to forget about his condition and rely simply on the story because this character is the story that he doesn't know he is telling and working in the world that he doesn't know he is living in. In fact this character is the centre of the universe in this film. Everything revolves around him. He is more than just a character; he is a reminder of reality because if you don't remember what order the scenes come in then you will not understand this film at all. What better way is there to feel like your living in a characters shoes than that? Pearce does a fabulous job of keeping everything in tact and getting off his character as likeable but still a very real person. It is nice to know that when David Lynch is gone there will still be someone who isn't afraid to make a film that doesn't merely focus on the story but more on how the audience interprets it.

The Country Bears is basically a combination of two movies  THE MUPPET MOVIE and THE BLUES BROTHERS.  Like The Muppet Movie, the audience SHOULD have been introduced to the Bears in their natural habitat perhaps in an entirely Bear world with Bear audiences, Bear storekeepers, Bear families, and Bearhound buses to help make the puppets seem real.  Once the audience believes in this fantasy world (think The Flintstones), have them venture out like Kermit from his pond to meet humans.  Instead, we are thrust head-on into a world where a few bears live with people with all but one kid seeing that they are actually bears.  The first scene is of the all-bear band playing for a stadium filled with screaming human teens.  I couldn't help think why were they attending a Barney-type concert?  Why were they watching grown men prance around in kiddie costumes?  Only humans were in the audience so apparently this was not in a fantasy world where bears and humans co-exist.  Also, the music, which was nice, wasn't something that would have brought this audience to it's feet.  It was really difficult believing they were real bears at this point since we were not introduced to their fantasy world.  Were talking bears common or were they unique and therefore that's why they were a big draw?  The next scene is of a young bear who lives with a human family (think of the dynamics of the little mouse STUART LITTLE who lived with a human family).  Dressed in an open short-sleeved shirt and jeans he looks a lot like Michael J. Fox in TEEN WOLF.  At least that film took it's time to introduce the story.  Like the Muppet Movie (and it's best sequel, A MUPPET CHRISTMAS CAROL), The Country Bears tries to be hip balancing act between entertaining kids as well as adults.  The film does a pretty good job of doing this but it seems an uphill battle.  Since the audience is never given a chance to see the bears as more than merely guys in costumes the jokes require blocking out all the damage the first fifteen minutes of the film has brought.  The first ten minutes of a film is crucial and here it is a death march.  The rest of the film is basically a re-working of THE BLUES BROTHERS as we visit one small country town after another trying to gather up the band for a big reunion concert which will save the day.  We get great music and great musical cameos to make this a long form music video more than a film (which is the nature of this genre and not a bad thing).  These bits are entertaining for the music but the presence of men in large bear costumes does make it difficult.  Kids under six won't mind, but if they were the only target, why the attempt at hip jokes, cameos only adults would know, etc...  A better beginning would have made a better film.  Perhaps on repeat viewings it wouldn't be so bad.  Then again, there isn't enough here to get most adults to watch it again.  If you want to see good country concert footage watch CMT or buy your favorite artist on video.  If your kids like Barney they will like this film too.

The other being the lead detective Cassie, played by Sandra Bullock, dealing with her dark past.The first plot is mildly more interesting, with a couple of kids plotting a murder with all the forensics details planned out so as to confuse the investigators.  What makes it interesting is the dynamics between the two kids, both from vastly different background, mutually coming together because of their one thing in common resulting in their constant need to be depended on each other.Beyond that, other parts of the story does not go so great.  Such as when one of our calculating killer who studied every aspect of forensic evidence and how to forge them, happens to vomits while dumping the body and forgets to clean up after himself.  And they plant evidence so as to produce a conflicting profile of the killer, while letting the trail lead to a suspect that is complete opposite of what the investigators were expecting, leading to suspicion.  Not very good if you want to have an open and shut case pointing to a third person.Compared to the much more realistic NYPD Blues, the dual interrogation that takes place looks pretty lame, with the investigators laying out their theory and expecting a confession.  Getting none, they slowly start floating the idea of the first one to snitch gets to live.  This is done, as opposed to playing off each of the perpetrators by revealing their theory as the other suspect's admission.  It is much more effective to let the suspects think the incriminating information is obtained from their criminal counterpart as opposed to some wild thing that the detectives dreamed up. As the lawyer for one of the kid shows up and gets him released, they could continue to play the second kid until he breaks down instead of releasing him.I thought the high tech stuff in the interrogation rooms was going to delve deeper into the suspects than what could be seen with they naked eye, like voice stress analysis, IR camera for heat distribution in the body and perspiration buildup.  But none of those things were there.  It was a lot of gadgety setup over nothing.The detective's work seems pretty shoddy for someone who is the best. Missing the ring on the suspect in the first place, apprehending the suspects by telling one to come over and forgetting the other one.  They were all critical things in which it affects the story, so I guess they were written in that way.As to the second plot, it is a total waste of time.  It is about Cassie, being a victim herself in the past, and having it rule her life.  Turning her into some character in which her co-workers label as hyena.  There is almost no purpose to this subplot, except for the fact she now automatically identifies self-centered rich kids as suspects because she thinks they think they could get away with anything.  More of a convenient feature so she could jump from A-Z without investigating the B-Y part.There were a few too many of those `Don't go there scenes' for my liking, turning it into one of those cliché ploys used in slasher movies.  And the final climax with the fake suicide, sudden burst of strength from a person on the verge of passing out and dying, the collapse of the porch, and of course the handling of the stick.  It was just too over the top.The acting was forgetful by Sandra Bullock, she seems to either knows how to play romantic comedy or tomboy roles, with nothing in between.

What makes it interesting is the dynamics between the two kids, both from vastly different background, mutually coming together because of their one thing in common resulting in their constant need to be depended on each other.Beyond that, other parts of the story does not go so great.  Such as when one of our calculating killer who studied every aspect of forensic evidence and how to forge them, happens to vomits while dumping the body and forgets to clean up after himself.  And they plant evidence so as to produce a conflicting profile of the killer, while letting the trail lead to a suspect that is complete opposite of what the investigators were expecting, leading to suspicion.  Not very good if you want to have an open and shut case pointing to a third person.Compared to the much more realistic NYPD Blues, the dual interrogation that takes place looks pretty lame, with the investigators laying out their theory and expecting a confession.  Getting none, they slowly start floating the idea of the first one to snitch gets to live.  This is done, as opposed to playing off each of the perpetrators by revealing their theory as the other suspect's admission.  It is much more effective to let the suspects think the incriminating information is obtained from their criminal counterpart as opposed to some wild thing that the detectives dreamed up. As the lawyer for one of the kid shows up and gets him released, they could continue to play the second kid until he breaks down instead of releasing him.I thought the high tech stuff in the interrogation rooms was going to delve deeper into the suspects than what could be seen with they naked eye, like voice stress analysis, IR camera for heat distribution in the body and perspiration buildup.  But none of those things were there.  It was a lot of gadgety setup over nothing.The detective's work seems pretty shoddy for someone who is the best. Missing the ring on the suspect in the first place, apprehending the suspects by telling one to come over and forgetting the other one.  They were all critical things in which it affects the story, so I guess they were written in that way.As to the second plot, it is a total waste of time.  It is about Cassie, being a victim herself in the past, and having it rule her life.  Turning her into some character in which her co-workers label as hyena.  There is almost no purpose to this subplot, except for the fact she now automatically identifies self-centered rich kids as suspects because she thinks they think they could get away with anything.  More of a convenient feature so she could jump from A-Z without investigating the B-Y part.There were a few too many of those `Don't go there scenes' for my liking, turning it into one of those cliché ploys used in slasher movies.  And the final climax with the fake suicide, sudden burst of strength from a person on the verge of passing out and dying, the collapse of the porch, and of course the handling of the stick.  It was just too over the top.The acting was forgetful by Sandra Bullock, she seems to either knows how to play romantic comedy or tomboy roles, with nothing in between.  The only person who was good was Michael Pitt, who played the mysterious recluse genius Justin.All in all, nothing great about the film, but watch-able except for some of the hollywood add-ons.

I saw a preview for this film in a theater, and truth be told, I wasn't too keen on seeing it. Still, I'd read some great reviews and I wanted a good movie for the kids. I am glad I took a chance on it.Ray Romano heads an all-star cast of voices as Manfred the mammoth. The story takes place during the ice age, where primitive man and ancient animals are going head to head. Denis Leary provides the voice of Diago, a cunning saber-tooth tiger who kidnaps a human baby as revenge against the humans for destroying some of his pack. Manfred and his dorky sidekick, Sid (John Leguizamo) get ahold of the baby, and vow to return it. Diago has plans to thwart their good intentions. Along way, Manfred, Sid, and Diago learn about the goodness that lies in every heart, but they also learn some important lessons about themselves.I love this movie for three reasons A) The pathetic squirrel chasing after the nut, almost a totally unrelated tangent to the story, is hilarious. B) Unlike a great many animated films, there are no disgusting bad guys to beat up. The premise of the story is simple and not too complex for little kids to figure out. There is also a very positive message that you don't have to dig around to find. C) The cast of voices, which also includes Goran Visnjic, Jack Black, Cedric the Entertainer, Diedrich Bader, and Jane Krakowski, are wonderful.I am not sure that all adults would like this movie, but my neice and nephews LOVED it. I really liked it too, and I would recommend it to any parents who want a nice, refreshing break from hard-core violence and glittery, overactive animation.

As Julia feels increasingly hurt at Henry's neglect, who should swoop in but the mysterious, charming Dudley (Cary Grant), telling Henry he's an angel who's there to answer Henry's prayer. Henry can't quite believe this even as Dudley seems to make himself quite at home in Henry's life, charming the wife, the child, the maids... even the taxi driver Sylvester (James Gleason). It's all a bit too much for Henry when Dudley finally brings the cathedral's biggest patron Mrs Hamilton (Gladys Cooper) around to the idea of donating the money to the homeless instead of to the cathedral. Is there anything left of Henry's life that he can salvage? And can he really compete against an angel who has God and little miracles on his side?THE BISHOP'S WIFE is a sweet little romantic dramedy, perfect for a Christmas night curled up before the TV set. You have to give it credit for packing in a lot more story and real, human characters than you'd expect--it's not stock Christmas heart-tugging schmokum (did I just make up a word?), but a story that's quite genuinely intelligent and real. It's not perfect (what is?), but its presentation of the characters, especially Dudley and Henry, ring true. You can believe that Henry, underneath his bitterness and myopia, really loves his wife. He's just... forgotten his direction in life, is all. Niven does an excellent job with the character, keeping him just this side of prim but making him sympathetic especially when he asks Dudley to put up his fists for Julia. My favourite secondary characters are Sylvester, played impeccably by Gleason, and the slightly dotty Professor Wutheridge (Monty Woolley). They're actually real *people*. Actually, they even fare better than Julia herself, whom I didn't particularly warm to. I wasn't annoyed by her, but nor did I feel that it was very likely she could get a reverend and an angel to almost come to blows over her. It's a shame that Loretta Young spent most of the film looking pensive, and even in her character's moments of joy--say the ice-skating scene--she simply fails to leap off the screen and run away with the audience's hearts.Cary Grant has no such problem, however. From the moment he strolls onscreen as Dudley--the guardian angel every girl wished she could have--he has everyone's attention. He makes Dudley just a little bit roguish, a little bit dark. You couldn't really take Grant seriously if he's all decked out in an angel's costume, halo and harp and all, but you *can* imagine him as a sort of very human kind of angel. Which is exactly what Dudley is. It's mostly the smaller moments Grant sneaks into the film and his own performance that make THE BISHOP'S WIFE compelling viewing, and if you came to this film as a Grant fan, you certainly won't leave it disappointed.All in all, the final film is well-drawn-together, cleverly written and directed, and benefiting from its two powerhouse male leads... Niven cleverly underplaying his part, and Grant suffusing Dudley with the charm and deep, hidden vulnerability he can suggest in all his characters without so much as faking a pained expression. It's definitely a great way to spend a Christmas night, and perhaps any other night. 8\/10.

Thanks to the game's high production values (at the time), and a very recognizable cast, it's one of those rare game series that would have always fit perfectly into movie form with little changes in design or plot line. Of course, Christ Roberts has to go and mess up a good thing, so he went out and found a younger cast (I would imagine to be more accessible to the young people who weren't really old enough to remember much about the games), completely redesigned the ships (not a good thing, for the games' designs were truly inspired for the most part, especially when compared to the WWII-inspired heaps in this film) and basically threw in a pseudo-religious subplot to muck things up a bit.In case you weren't able to gather it from above, I really wasn't expecting much of this film, and frankly, after having watched it, I'm rather pleasantly surprised. The CGI, while not up to par with what you'll see today, is quite respectable, particularly wide space combat and HUD shots (this is probably what Wing Commander would look like on the X-Box), and the acting is actually quite competent, with the possible exception of Prinze, who while not terrible, just doesn't seem cast all that well here. Tchéky Karyo is the consumate actor as always, taking a role that could easily be taken for granted and fleshing it out quite well, while Matthew Lillard manages to be a bit less nauseating that usual, even bordering on the endearing.This isn't a film without flaws.

It's fortunate that they're only seen a couple of times, because while they're onscreen you can't help but think that it could have been done far better.All in all, while a classic by no means, Wing Commander actually surprised me, and as far as modern sci-fi movies go (though it must be said that this is actually more of an old-fashioned war movie set in a sci-fi setting), this managed to please much more than I had expected.

The supporting cast includes Demi Moore, Kevin Pollack, Wolfgang Bodison, Kevin Bacon, Keifer Sutherland, J.T. Walsh, and Cuba Gooding Jr.The acting is mediocre. Not very good. The script is written poorly as the movie is not very suspensful, but yet it is still aired on TV almost every week out where I live. I find it hard to believe that this movie got nominated for several Academy Awards and yet, the far superior RULES OF ENGAGEMENT did not win any. There is some bad cinemetography and some cheesy wannabe suspense scenes which make this seem almost like a made for TV movie, but still the film is good.

The supporting cast includes Demi Moore, Kevin Pollack, Wolfgang Bodison, Kevin Bacon, Keifer Sutherland, J.T. Walsh, and Cuba Gooding Jr.The acting is mediocre. Not very good. The script is written poorly as the movie is not very suspensful, but yet it is still aired on TV almost every week out where I live. I find it hard to believe that this movie got nominated for several Academy Awards and yet, the far superior RULES OF ENGAGEMENT did not win any. There is some bad cinemetography and some cheesy wannabe suspense scenes which make this seem almost like a made for TV movie, but still the film is good.

Having seen nearly all of the Friday the 13th series and been more and more disappointed with the efforts of each it was fantastic to see a film take itself so lightly. As usual there was a fair amount of gore and teenage lust but the script has some, without trying to sound clichéd, killer jokes. The acting left a lot to be desired but this has come to be expected with this particular slasher series. The story is based around the context that Jason has been frozen in cryogenic stasis while the world around him has fallen to pieces and mankind has deserted the earth. That of course doesn't stop some meddling students on an interstellar field trip finding and defrosting him. Great idea kids! The result is a fiendishly funny and not entirely unscary film. It has its moments of corny dialogue (man falls on top of giant screw and twists down it - he's screwed is the line) but this is offset by some laugh out loud jokes. One especially good one is near the end so hang around even if your not enjoying it. I can only recommend this film to anyone looking for good solid entertainment and a film that takes itself lightly.

It shows what still is true, prejudice and racism are well alive worldwide.I have no complaints about the story but I do think that the script lacks quality. It has way too much pathos for my taste and does the conflict it tries do depict no justice. It doesn't want to tell us about the oppression of ethnic groups, we should be well aware of that anyhow, it is happening all the time. It tries to depict the fate of an individual and as such it utterly fails.DeNiro and Cuba do not work too well together, either. There's no chemistry. It always feels like Scene 08, Take 15. I do like DeNiro and Cuba usually and regard them as being fine actors but maybe they should read the script a little closer next time before hopping aboard...Just because the story is true and just because the issue depicted is still a problem today - not only in the states but worldwide - still does not merit any higher rating than a 5 and that mostly due to the craftsmanship of the 2 main actors.
