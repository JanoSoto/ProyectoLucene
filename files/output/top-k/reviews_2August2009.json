The special effects, CGI, story, every aspect of this film is something fresh and original, even today, ten years after it was originally released. To use an analogy, The Matrix is what I like to call the Kurt Cobain of films, as my review title says. Any fans of 90s rock music should understand my comparison. That being said, if you are like me, you won't find this film to be anything truly special the first time you watch it. It's kind of like The Godfather, in a sense. The more times you view it, the more things you will pick up on and you realize that you missed so many things when you watched the movie the first time around. The first time I sat down and watched The Matrix, I finished it and said to myself- Okay, that was good. Great? Not so much. Then, a couple months later, I watched the film for the second time. When I re-watched The Matrix, I came to realize how truly great it is. There were several things that I came to understand that I didn't understand when I first watched The Matrix. The acting is excellent in all three Matrix films, but it was easily superior in this installment in the trilogy. Keanu Reeves plays Neo well, you simply have to love Laurence Fishburne in his role as the enigmatic Morpheus, Carrie-Anne Moss did well as Trinity, but the show was stolen by Hugo Weaving, who is completely AWESOME as Smith. These films aren't for everyone. But if you are looking for something original and revolutionary, The Matrix is the way to go.

I went to see it, first run - 1966, on a double date. This was back in the days when you could walk in anytime and stay as long as you wanted.So, we got there, sat down and (Spoiler coming), it's almost the end of the previous showing, and I'm thinking, OK, the climax must have happened about 5 minutes earlier and this is the denouement (concluding scenes winding down).So we watch the entire movie and I realize as we get to it, that I saw the climatic scene when we first got there - they have abandoned ship (the Proteus) and are shooting through a mass of tangles and then make it through the optic nerve to the eye and are rescued. That was the climax.Was I let down. It was actually interesting to that point - even Stephen Boyd's almost wooden acting, and Raquel Welch doing her best to look all sciency and proper. It was a nice average mid-60's SF movie, nothing special, but adequate.I watched all Raquel's movies during this time - Fathom, Biggest Bundle. etc. She sure gave Jill St. John a run for iceberg queen.

I had viewed this one as a child and I remember certain parts of the film, but after re-watching it, I cannot believe my parents let me view this one. This is not due to the monsters or the gore, but there is a lot of nudity in this one and the monsters rape their female victims! Granted, the rapes never take that much time so they are not on screen for long. The film, reminds me of a combination of other films of the era. It is a rather good horror film featuring monsters though as the monsters do look good, there is some good gore and the ladies are all quite lovely. The only thing that really pulls the film down a bit is a subplot featuring a cannery coming to town where the local redneck battles the local Indian. Just pads the film out, but they really could have fleshed out the monsters a bit more to accomplish this.The story starts out with a bang. Some fisherman go out on their boats and are soon attacked by something. A little boy is the first to go in very surprising fashion. The boat blows up leaving no evidence of the attack for the authorities. This part reminded me a bit of Jaws II and the attack of the shark on the two people in the boat that end up blowing up. Soon, dogs are being killed left and right and then we go on to a dance where an Indian against the coming of a cannery comes in and we see his dog is dead too, though chances are it is because the local redneck killed it cause he does not care for the Indian's opposition to the cannery. Well soon, people are being attacked by strange fish creatures and women are being raped. A scientist at the cannery seems to know something, but will she figure things out in time to stop the creatures from killing everyone? Like I said, it was a rather good horror film. If not for the padding, I would have given it a higher score. The monsters look sort of like the creature from the black lagoon, only nastier and more real. In fact, I find them more realistic than the scene where a man is able to coax a woman out of her clothes using a ventriloquist dummy! The movie has its slow parts, but then really has a good finale as the monsters are attacking this festival in full force, but we also see the main character's wife have to endure an attack from these nasty creatures too. Then it kind of ends in unspectacular fashion as people are just kind of wandering here and there after the fair. Then one last scene that lets the film end on an unpleasant, but familiar note.

But since this is a war film about humans fighting against bugs, it is indeed challenging in a way that you got these two different races from different worlds fighting each other. So it is very unlike those historical war films that we saw before about Vietnam war, and World War II. Those kinds of films are more easier for people to relate with because of the human emotions, there's the drama or a look into the human psyche when people are killing each other. But its difficult to see that in Starship troopers because all we ever see is just the actions in battle. The perspective was pretty much focused on the humans of course, while the bugs are just being portrayed as totally villainous. Which for me, it's pretty narrow, as it appears to be like you know, We humans must slaughter them all since they attacked us.. this would be OK if this film is to be watched or enjoyed under the light of purely entertainment, because to me this film only portrays the human side. As I watched this film, I kept on asking myself, What good are the humans? We have our own pathetic weaknesses too, but in the end, we as humans still enjoy the outcome of the wars when we blow our enemies into bloody pieces. There's a lot of blood and ore in this film, but never really show the professional maneuvers of the military. I do not feel it is real because I do not feel being part of the combat. I've seen older war films that has done a greater job than this one, because in those war films its just never about the guns and the shouting, and all the blood. You actually get to experience the psychological horror or shock coming from the actors, but in this film, you don't really see that. All we see is the joy of blowing the bugs into pieces and killing them. We don't see the actual emotional experiences of how war might have any effects on the character's mental state. Maybe just little bit at the beginning when Rico discovers how terrifying the bugs are, but their encounter with the bugs are always the same. The same kind of tension, the same kind of challenge, and there's really nothing new other than the flying and giant new monsters. I do not feel like being in a battle field because the humans are just running all over the places and shooting the bugs in bundles. I would enjoy it more to see the humans actually are attempting to accomplish certain orders on the battle field under the command of somebody. I like the drama, and the girl who played Carmen, she's gorgeous and it really makes me to dislike early on because of her character and I really wanted to see her to be with Rico again, but somehow it didn't really work that powerful. It becomes like I really don't care anymore about them because I don't really see a lot of conflict between them. I really wanted more out of them. Maybe all this is little too much for this film, and maybe its because I've seen some of the war films already that were pretty much better than this one. So this could be biased. Overall I think its alright...for just purely entertainment.

Well technically i didn't REALLY pick it up because it's movie number 20 in the Chilling Classics Box set. So how does it stack up? isn't that the million dollar question.This movie was odd. That's the best word i can use to describe it. It was a disgusting gore fest, but at the same time, meant to be a comedy. And there were a few moments where despite myself i had to go ok, that's kind of amusing. but for the most part i was so busy trying not to vomit that i really didn't find too many of the jokes to be at all entertaining. Was the fact that Peter's skull kept opening supposed to be a joke? cause i just found that really disgusting and unsettling.I mean, i really like horror movies, but i guess to the extent that less is definitely more. This movie wasn't meant to terrify, but to completely gross you out. i can't think of any other reason this movie exists. The movie would have been fine on its own without all that unnecessary gore. If they cut out all the gore, the movie would have been fine. I mean it's not that hard to re-edit it, cutting out all the over the top stuff. If they were going for a comedy, all they had to do was cut that stuff out. I don't like being horrifically grossed out while they're attempting to make me laugh. No thanks.

I had never seen anything like it. It was magical. The film took hold of me from the first minute and didn't let go before the film was over. Perfect. As the film was actually the director Stanley Kubrick's project, a film he had planned for 20 years, he didn't get to finish it because of his death. The film is based on a novel by Brian Aldiss from 1969 (Supertoys Last All Summer Long). After Kubrick's death in 1999, his wife asked Steven Spielberg if he would bring her deceased husband's vision to the screen. Spielberg had spoken several times with Kubrick about the film, and he accepted the task. The result is a mixture of Spielberg and Kubrick, two of the greatest geniuses in film. The film is a mixture of the sentimental Spielberg, a commercial, family film and Kubrick's detailed, thought-provoking and visually stunning talents. It is the mixture of heart and brain. A perfect film. Haley Joel Osment, who proves he is one of the best child actors ever in this film, plays David; he is actually a robot, but he looks like, behaves like, feels like and shares love like a human being. The son of Henry and Monica is in a coma, and they decide to take in David as a kind of substitute for their own son. Monica establishes a maternal love for David, and decides to activate him, so he gets the same love for her. But as he has been activated, he can't ever be deactivated.

Now when David is not familiar with anyone, he has no one to give his unconditional love to, the movie really blossoms. A.I. is filled with amazing special effects and many visual moments as David tries to find out who he really is. The film ends in a great, beautiful and heart wrenching way. I sat there after the end, with the underlying questions What makes us real? Is it the ability to love and to be loved that makes us human?

His surrealist and unique style, along with his typical filming way and nonsensical dialogues gave him a mixed reputation. What some might call a wacky, stupid and disconnected movie is regarded by fans and followers of the director as a visionary and revolutionary film. And the meaning of revolutionary is also revisited in Mulholland Dr. The plot is a little complicated. It transmits to the watcher a sensation that something is going on, some mystery is in the air. From the moment the film begins, following a young actress arriving at L.A. filled with dreams, to the bare end, this big feeling of mystery, of some meaning on every scene to be understood and solved, follows the mind of spectators, who are subliminally told to make their own theories about the movie. One of the most characteristic traces on Lynch's way of making his movies is the 'cult' atmosphere. This atmosphere is reinforced by the professional acting, the uncommon scenes and the insertion of some apparently disconnected situations in the movie. Here on Mulholland Dr., these traces are strong and remarkable. The elements and the feeling of watching a thriller are reinforced by the Lynch elements. The expressivity of the nonsense here is a proof that a movie is not always a way of telling a story. The pure cinema art of David Lynch is the art of touching the spectator, of expressing feelings and ideas even with no coherent story. And this creates the atmosphere I'm talking' about. That's an allegory to the real plot of the thriller, those metaphors, those apparent useless bullsh*t to uninitiated people. The coolest thing about this surrealism here in Brazil is the fact that some stupid translator changed the title of the film to 'Cidade dos Sonhos' (City of Dreams), which is somehow allusive to the dream-like sequences that appear sometimes. The last piece on Lynch's masterpiece is all the mystery around the plot. We are introduced to new things, to new elements and new characters by the end of the movie, which are there to help on fulfilling our need to explanations&#x85; in part. Because Mulholland Dr.'s ending isn't conclusive at all. Lynch opens the door so we can enter and finish the story with our own theories and versions. For people who like solving problems, the director left ten clues to solve the thriller and find his own version of the story. But that's not really necessary to like Mulholland Dr. or any other Lynch movie. You don't necessarily have to understand one of his movies to like them. You have to watch and immerse yourself into the film, I guess. And that's why Mulholland Drive is really a fantastic thriller, which's worthy of watching many times so you can make your own version and get clues that reinforce it. All the pieces of a multiple combination puzzle are there on a brilliant plot. Along with great acting, shooting and arranging of sounds (another trademark of Lynch's movies, the experimentalism of sounds to make a scene), this is what makes watching Mulholland Drive a remarkable experience of the senses, and elects this film to a status of pure expressive art.

Bond's mission takes him to sunny Jamaica, where he meets an assortment of interesting characters, some more welcoming than others.Connery is basically the Bond by which all other Bonds are measured, so it should come as no surprise that his performance here is up to par.

The movie's female lead, Ursula Andress, is routinely singled out as one of the best Bond girls of all time despite the fact that her dialogue was dubbed by another actress. Admittedly, the dubbing is well done and Andress has undeniable sex appeal. Meanwhile, we get memorable support from Joseph Wiseman, Anthony Dawson & Jack Lord, among others, including our introductions to recurring characters M (Bernard Lee) & Miss Moneypenny (Lois Maxwell).The script is full of the usual twists and turns that we've come to expect from an espionage thriller. The movie may not be as bombastic as later entries in the franchise but there's something fresh and appealing about its relative simplicity. On the technical side, the direction by Terence Young is nicely handled and the vibrant Technicolor makes for plenty of luscious visuals. The film also introduces the iconic Bond theme in the opening credits while mixing in music with a Jamaican flavour from time to time as well.In conclusion, whether you're a Bond fan or just a fan of action films in general you shouldn't miss out on Bond's first outing.

Meanwhile, we get memorable support from Joseph Wiseman, Anthony Dawson & Jack Lord, among others, including our introductions to recurring characters M (Bernard Lee) & Miss Moneypenny (Lois Maxwell).The script is full of the usual twists and turns that we've come to expect from an espionage thriller. The movie may not be as bombastic as later entries in the franchise but there's something fresh and appealing about its relative simplicity. On the technical side, the direction by Terence Young is nicely handled and the vibrant Technicolor makes for plenty of luscious visuals. The film also introduces the iconic Bond theme in the opening credits while mixing in music with a Jamaican flavour from time to time as well.In conclusion, whether you're a Bond fan or just a fan of action films in general you shouldn't miss out on Bond's first outing. It may seem a bit quaint today given the franchise's later excesses but it still has all of the ingredients that have made the series such a success for over 50 years.

Its his writers that have gone down hill. If you want to see how unfunny Adam really is watch this movie. This is Adam raw and not directed. This is worse then the longest yard but a long yard.

The script itself is nothing special, but the actors make it touching and unique, the characters sympathetic and real. I thank this film for introducing me to one of Hollywood's best actors, Kevin Kline. His portrayal of George is nothing short of perfection. It makes me wish he was my dad. Jena Malone is hilarious and sweet as the flirtatious and Lolita-esque Alyssa. But the one who really shines here is Hayden Christensen. His performance as the troubled and angry Sam is moving. In the beginning he's just so cold and mean that you can't help but hate him. But as the film goes on you learn about the sense of abandonment and betrayal Sam feels at the hands of his father for leaving him alone with a detached and selfish step-dad who obviously is not fond of him. By the middle of the film Sam suddenly becomes vulnerable and opens up and you can't help but root for him and wish him success. And as a child from a divorced family I can definitely identify with him and understand his pain. For those who think Hayden is nothing more than a pretty face with no acting skills, I say watch this film and say that again. This is his best performance to date. Christensen and Kline have amazing father-son chemistry and their relationship in the film is presented beautifully.And I absolutely love how the drama in the film is balanced with comedy. At some points you might cry, but at others you will cry from laughing so hard.The Bad The sexuality here is good, to a certain point. It is a coming of age story so naturally there will be horny teenagers, and the sexual experimenting between Sam and Alyssa is integral in Sam's journey .Sam's opening masturbation scene is hilarious as well, BUT... It gets out of hand by the second half of the film. I really didn't need to see the sex scene between Somerhalder and Steenburgen.

Spielberg took a huge step in turning the events of Schindler and the Jews he put on his list to work for him that would ultimately be saved by him. Spielberg executes this very sensitive topic by putting so much emotion in it. The first time I watched this movie was in my junior year in high school in American History class and throughout the movie it was amazing to see the different expressions of shock, stunned, and tears in the eyes of even high schoolers. The movie, although very long, keeps your attention.

This may owe more to a poor script than Stanley Kubrick, who stepped in for original director Anthony Mann during the production due to a fight with Kirk Douglas. Had it been the other way around with Mann been kept on and Douglas fired, I doubt this CLEOPATRA-style grandiose-yet-awkward film would have suffered. Actually it might have been much better and more cohesive as too much feels as though the director lacked interest and most of the best scenes are more Mann-ish than Kubick-esquire.The film starts off traditionally enough &#x96; Spartacus is raised in the slave pits and makes a seamless transition to gladiator. Somewhere along the line he manages to figure out a sense of unbreakable moral virtue and never strays from it the rest of the film, thus making his character 1-dimensional and unfortunately pretty boring. Despite all this, the film is fine up until the standout slave break-out scene where Spartacus begins his rebellion and our plot lines diverge. The film then cuts back and forth from following Spartacus's army to the political rivalry between Laurence Olivier and Charles Laughton as Roman senators looking to profit from the whole mess. It turns out that these extremely charismatic villains are much more interesting to watch than bland Kirk Douglas, who is completely overshadowed with his subdued Heston performance and Christ-like central character.The film does highly benefit from many colorful supporting characters and great performances. Some highlights include Peter Ustinov as a stressed-out slave trader, Woody Strode as a stoic gladiator who snaps, Herbert Lom as a Phoenician pirate (!), and Charles McGraw as a hateful veteran gladiator\/instructor. John Ireland and Tony Curtis don't get to do much as Spartacus's right and left hand, though Curtis has a disturbing yet slightly amusing scene where Olivier (extremely well-dubbed by Anthony Hopkins for the reissue) attempts to seduce him. Jean Simmons (no, not one from KISS) is quite restrained and bland as Douglas's love interest, though she isn't really given much to do either.Usually epics like this are redeemed by massive battle scenes but (despite some heavy gore for the time) the big show-stopping fight is not the best of the genre, owing some to Alex North's pedestrian score and Kubrick's apparent disinterest. All throughout you'll be wondering if Kubrick really had much input on this movie at all as it contains almost none of the touches he brought to his films before or after this one. Add to that the fact that this true story really oversimplifies, skimps, and downright lies in its complete dearth of historical accuracy, this film may actually make you dumber having watched it. SPARTACUS is just a big disappointment all-round, despite some great performances and costuming.
