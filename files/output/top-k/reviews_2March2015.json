[{"date":"2 March 2015","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" The year 2000 brought us two very different films centering around drug addiction and the war against drugs.Traffic is a sweeping epic that flawlessly weaves three separate stories together in an incisive examination into the war against drugs and how it is a battle that, no matter what we do, we will continue to lose.One story revolves around a judge, played by Michael Douglas, who is appointed by the President of the United States to be the new Drug Czar and as serious as he is about his job, his neglect of his home life is revealed to have its own consequences as it is revealed that his own daughter has become addicted to crack cocaine, an addiction that has led her to selling her body to a drug dealer in order to continue getting high.Another story involves the pregnant trophy wife of a major drug trafficker (Catherine Zeta-Jones), who has tried to turn a blind eye to what her husband does, but when her husband is arrested and facing serious jail time, she opens her eyes and takes charge up to the point of ordering a hit on the primary witness against her husband and continuing to negotiate international deals to keep her husband's product moving.Benecio Del Toro won a Supporting Actor Oscar for his role in the third story, a somewhat corrupt Mexican border cop who finds out his new boss is not who he thinks he is and how his work has put himself and his best friend (Jacob Vargas) in serious danger.Director Steven Soderbergh blindsided Ridley Scott by winning the Best Director Oscar for his brilliant weaving of these stories together, which also includes riveting turns by Don Cheadle and Luiz Guzman as cops assigned to keep their key witness against Zeta-Jones' husband in one piece. Though Del Toro won the supporting actor Oscar, I personally would have given it to Cheadle, who is just magnificent here. Erika Christensen is very effective as Douglas' daughter as is Dennis Quaid as Zeta-Jones' husband's sleazy attorney, who has always had his own agenda regarding his boss and his boss' wife. Miguel Ferrer also scores as the witness Cheadle and Guzman are assigned to protect.Soderberg proved to be a master cinematic storyteller with this compelling drama told on a large canvas that sustains interest and stirs emotions in equal doses, a sobering indictment regarding a war that we continue to be in denial about losing.

Even though Leon The Professional is the best of the foursome, they're all very worthy in terms of quality. In the case of La Femme Nikita, we need to realize that even though many situations are deemed implausible and to just sit back and enjoy some jaw-dropping action that will likely leave you in shock until the final credits roll.Anne Parillaud stars as Nikita, a rebellious, drug-addicted teen who hangs around with the wrong crowd. One night, these miscreants decide to rob a pharmacy in which one of the members' father owns the store. When the owner\/father arrives on the scene with a gun, and notices his son and his friends stealing items in the store, things start to get real ugly. The father is shot to death and the police arrive on the scene where a stand-off takes shape. The gang is all shot dead with the exception of Nikita who surprisingly blows away a cop who was trying to revive her.Nikita is now incarcerated for life. While serving her time, Nikita is manipulated by her captors that she was contemplating suicide by a tranquilizer overdose. when she awakens, she is greeted by sharp clad man named Bob (Tcheky Karyo) and offers her an ultimatum. She is now under the care of the DSGE she can either be an assassin or go by way of row 8, plot 30 (her grave). She chooses to become an assassin and has excelled in the craft quite impressively. She even becomes computer savvy, skilled in martial arts and weaponry and even appears quite like a businesswoman like in appearance. After fulfilling her first missions, she is transferred to Paris as an enforcer to when the DSGE needs her. While in Paris, she meets a guy named Marco (Jean-Hughes Anglade) and they start a relationship with him oblivious as to what her profession is. Marco is puzzled as to why she has no family, friends or any kind of connection whatsoever. Bob gets invited to dinner as poses as her Uncle Bob and offers them two tickets to Venice, Italy as an engagement gift.But the trip and the moment of happiness comes to an end when Nikita receives a call about going on a mission with a sniper rifle in the bathroom. There she kills a woman and leaves her disappointed.The film ends when someone named The Cleaner (Jean Reno) who was sent to destroy all the evidence which at cost leaves him wounded by the embassy guards and gets killed while trying to escape from them. Marco eventually knows about her secret life and that draws concerns over her psychological scars, he decides that what's best for her is to vanish forever. Feeling that she abandoned the DSGE, Bob and Marco discuss what's in store for her, they agree she will be missed.With the exception of the rushed conclusion, this is an otherwise exciting start to the expectations of Besson's other commercial films especially Leon The Professional. I guess at the time Besson was still trying to master his craft as a filmmaker and though even if the pacing was contrived at times, the set-pieces were still something quite noteworthy; Nikita's induction hit, the assassination mission in Italy plus every scene featuring The Cleaner are primary examples of how dynamic Besson really is. The Cleaner is one of the coolest characters in this movie and make no mistake about it, he was the inspiration to the character Wolf from Quinton Tarantino's Pulp Fiction who was played by Harvey Keitel after Keitel played The Cleaner in the American 1993 Nikita remake. In Leon The Professional, Leon is believed to be a distant cousin to The Cleaner.The movie itself spawned many remakes and imitators over the past couple of decades. John Badham directed a pretty decent remake titled Point of No Return with Bridget Fonda playing Nikita who's name was changed to Maggie. In Canada, Joel Surnow directed a TV series starring Peta Wilson in the lead that lasted for five seasons (1997-2001). And Warner Brothers distributed a television series starring Maggie Q in the Nikita as she defected from her employment from the agency is now plotting to bring them down.The movie here was quite stimulating. Besson's direction was well executed, but the performances were quite memorable. Parillaud was Cesar winner for performance and Karyo was very convincing as Bob. But the finale was way too hurried it might leave one demanding for a sequel otherwise, it is a bit of a letdown.Overall I recommend this film with the exception of a poorly hurried finale that was anti-climactic. But the action and the performances are truly one you'll likely treasure. For those who love action films and girls with guns, you're in for a real treat.

","genre":"Action, Thriller"},{"date":"2 March 2015","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Lars von Trier's Breaking the Waves tells the story of Bess McNeill (Emily Watson), a young Scottish woman burdened by psychological issues and the judgments of a frigid, Calvinist community that clings to the traditional teachings of the church. By traditional, I mean classic gender roles and little to no expressive freedoms outside the home can be enjoyed and embraced by females. Bess, like most women in the village, marries young, to an oil rig worker named Jan (Stellan Skarsgård), an atheist who provides Bess with the kind of warmth and acceptance she's not used to, not even from her own family. Bess's relationship with Jan is one of the most significant relationships she has in life, tied only with God, who she prays to each day and converses with Him using her own voice. More on that later.When Jan takes a job out of town, Bess becomes incredibly lonely, one day praying for Jan to come home. Following a serious, nearly-fatal accident at an oil site that leaves Jan paralyzed, Bess curses herself for being selfish and wishing for Jan to return home. Because of this, she submits herself to the mercy of Jan, who instructs her to go out in the world and seek the highest form of human pleasure, sexual intercourse, for he feels like a failure of a man for never being able to provide her with such sensations and feelings ever again. The film follows Bess's sexual awakening, as she's caught between the cold shoulders of her family and her village along with the desire to please Jan and adhere to the teachings and expectations of her almighty creator.Von Trier illustrates from the beginning that Bess carries the crippling weight of harsh judgment on her shoulders from numerous different individuals, and downplays the idea of mental illness in favor of showing the repercussions of such pressure. If you were living in a traditional village, already a minority being a female, limited in your rights as a human being, felt ostracized and unloved by your family, harshly criticized no matter what choice you made, and the only person you were able to unconditionally love who loved you back sat on the teetering edge of death and lackluster quality of life, I think you'd be hardpressed not to have a mental breakdown. Von Trier illustrates the Bess character as someone not easily written off as a whiny, insecure twit nor somebody crippled by a mental illness, but somebody tired and worn, and who will only grow to be more exhausted as time goes on.Her conversations with God are the most interesting because, as I stated before, she acts as God responding to her prayers and requests. Her comments as God reflect an assumed bitterness about the Almighty's general attitude towards her and her decisions that seems to more or less be made up of the general opinion of her in her village. This explicitly shows that she has predicated her idea about God's opinion of her thanks to the false, perverted teachings of her Calvinist church and the rejection of her family. It's an ugly way to see life, but who could blame her for not bearing even a shred of confidence after all that she has been through in life? Breaking the Waves follows Bess closely for all one-hundred and fifty-nine minutes, rarely including a scene without her and rarely losing sight of her as a character. Metaphorical interpretation of the character could potentially see her as Jesus Christ himself, somebody well-worn with the responsibility of providing solace (or saving in a grandiose sense) to the one she loves, and putting up with a great deal of mistreatment amongst her peers, especially as she turns to prostitution. A key parallel between Bess's story and the life of Christ is when Bess is walking her bicycle through her village, in torn leggings, looking disheveled and moments from collapse, as young children walk behind her, throwing rocks at her and hurling insults. This scene directly mimics widespread interpretation of the Romans taunting Christ as he carried his cross to his death, and in this particular scene, Bess is made so powerless and feeble that the children that tail her are seen as more powerful and worthy than her.The film is shot in the 1990's style known as Dogma 95 which was characterized by immediacy, naturalism, and the lack of artistic credit. The film is shot with a hand-held camera, using natural, available light and nothing more, and neither von Trier nor any of the actors involve receive credit in the form of opening or closing titles within the film. This provides Breaking the Waves with an additional later of blunt realism, capturing the ugliness of life as is and not tweaking or modifying its appearance to fit some kind of cutesy disposition or inauthentic portrayal of mood. Dogma 95 is a style that effectively communicates ugliness and it does nothing but elevate this film to a grittier height.Whether you're viewing it as a surface exploration of a battered character driving herself off a cliff she's long rested on the edge of or a story that mirrors the life of our lord and savior, Breaking the Waves is a fantastic motion picture, heartbreaking and, not only brutal, but convincing in its depiction of depravity. Von Trier masterfully contrasts the beauty and intimacy sex can bring and the horrid, unexpected consequences it can bring when practiced in a shallow and unsafe manner, along with putting emotionally complex characters on screen for us to evaluate in several different ways. The 1990's was a decade that allowed for revolutionary cinematic movements far and wide, and amidst incredibly pivotal voices of Richard Linklater and Spike Lee, was Lars von Trier, who showed it like it was in a way nobody wanted to see, but needed to.

","genre":"Drama, Romance"},{"date":"2 March 2015","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Lars von Trier's Breaking the Waves tells the story of Bess McNeill (Emily Watson), a young Scottish woman burdened by psychological issues and the judgments of a frigid, Calvinist community that clings to the traditional teachings of the church. By traditional, I mean classic gender roles and little to no expressive freedoms outside the home can be enjoyed and embraced by females. Bess, like most women in the village, marries young, to an oil rig worker named Jan (Stellan Skarsgård), an atheist who provides Bess with the kind of warmth and acceptance she's not used to, not even from her own family. Bess's relationship with Jan is one of the most significant relationships she has in life, tied only with God, who she prays to each day and converses with Him using her own voice. More on that later.When Jan takes a job out of town, Bess becomes incredibly lonely, one day praying for Jan to come home. Following a serious, nearly-fatal accident at an oil site that leaves Jan paralyzed, Bess curses herself for being selfish and wishing for Jan to return home. Because of this, she submits herself to the mercy of Jan, who instructs her to go out in the world and seek the highest form of human pleasure, sexual intercourse, for he feels like a failure of a man for never being able to provide her with such sensations and feelings ever again. The film follows Bess's sexual awakening, as she's caught between the cold shoulders of her family and her village along with the desire to please Jan and adhere to the teachings and expectations of her almighty creator.Von Trier illustrates from the beginning that Bess carries the crippling weight of harsh judgment on her shoulders from numerous different individuals, and downplays the idea of mental illness in favor of showing the repercussions of such pressure. If you were living in a traditional village, already a minority being a female, limited in your rights as a human being, felt ostracized and unloved by your family, harshly criticized no matter what choice you made, and the only person you were able to unconditionally love who loved you back sat on the teetering edge of death and lackluster quality of life, I think you'd be hardpressed not to have a mental breakdown. Von Trier illustrates the Bess character as someone not easily written off as a whiny, insecure twit nor somebody crippled by a mental illness, but somebody tired and worn, and who will only grow to be more exhausted as time goes on.Her conversations with God are the most interesting because, as I stated before, she acts as God responding to her prayers and requests. Her comments as God reflect an assumed bitterness about the Almighty's general attitude towards her and her decisions that seems to more or less be made up of the general opinion of her in her village. This explicitly shows that she has predicated her idea about God's opinion of her thanks to the false, perverted teachings of her Calvinist church and the rejection of her family. It's an ugly way to see life, but who could blame her for not bearing even a shred of confidence after all that she has been through in life? Breaking the Waves follows Bess closely for all one-hundred and fifty-nine minutes, rarely including a scene without her and rarely losing sight of her as a character. Metaphorical interpretation of the character could potentially see her as Jesus Christ himself, somebody well-worn with the responsibility of providing solace (or saving in a grandiose sense) to the one she loves, and putting up with a great deal of mistreatment amongst her peers, especially as she turns to prostitution. A key parallel between Bess's story and the life of Christ is when Bess is walking her bicycle through her village, in torn leggings, looking disheveled and moments from collapse, as young children walk behind her, throwing rocks at her and hurling insults. This scene directly mimics widespread interpretation of the Romans taunting Christ as he carried his cross to his death, and in this particular scene, Bess is made so powerless and feeble that the children that tail her are seen as more powerful and worthy than her.The film is shot in the 1990's style known as Dogma 95 which was characterized by immediacy, naturalism, and the lack of artistic credit. The film is shot with a hand-held camera, using natural, available light and nothing more, and neither von Trier nor any of the actors involve receive credit in the form of opening or closing titles within the film. This provides Breaking the Waves with an additional later of blunt realism, capturing the ugliness of life as is and not tweaking or modifying its appearance to fit some kind of cutesy disposition or inauthentic portrayal of mood.

I really like Hayden Christenson. I think he's a decent actor, rather unfairly blamed in this film for giving the performance his director asked for. And Anakin is painful in this one. from his misplaced arrogance towards Obi-wan to his cringe worthy attempts to get Padme into bed, and Natalie Portman isn't much better. Padme has been established as a strong character, and in this one we need to start believing that she is Leia's mother, but for 75% of this she is flirting with Anakin and then shutting it down, flirting with Anakin and shutting it down. Repeat cycle. It's left to Ewan McGregor, as Obi wan to carry the story, and he does an awesome job. If there's one actor who looks completely at home in the prequel trilogy, it's McGregor. Obi-wan is the one left to discover the clone planet and then track Jango Fett.It's in the last act, with their love established, that Anakin and Padme come to the party and start being interesting. We can finally see some of Leia in Padme as she takes over the situation and runs headlong into battle. Anakin in the meantime has continued his journey towards the dark side by slaughtering a tribe of sand people. And we can see a bit of Luke in Anakin as well. And not just the annoying whining. He's basically being faced with the same choices as Luke in the original trilogy and either making the opposite decisions to Luke (getting involved in a romance, slaughtering a tribe out of vengeance) or making the same bad decisions (running off here with Padme is as bad as Luke running off to Cloud City in Empire), so Lucas isn't doing it well, but he is establishing some sort of parallel path between the parents and their children.Anyway Windu and Yoda get to kick some ass, and Christopher Lee gets to run around as Palpatine's apprentice and act like an Evil Sith, which looks like a lot of fun for him, while Palpatine manipulates Jar Jar into giving him executive powers (Senator Amidala showed very questionable judgment by making Jar Jar her replacement, and here he is, destroying democracy). This is kind of clever as it turns the much maligned Binks into a tragic character, but it isn't that clever.We end with Anakin and Padme having a forbidden marriage and the clones flying off into the stars in early versions of star destroyers. The Republic is taking shape and the Jedis, while knowing there is a fight coming, are oblivious to Palpatine's duplicity.You can see what Lucas was trying to do here, and he's made a good movie, albeit with a painful love story and some disgraceful dialogue. Attack of the clones is not a bad film, just one that could have been far better. At least Lucas now had all the characters where he wanted them for Part 3, which was a film so good, it completely justified the prequel trilogy.

But he's long since broken free of that frame, assuming he ever needed to. He is a harbinger of fear, that great primal substance that sent people scurrying from their televisions, from their beaches and from any signs of water in 1975, and brought them back again in their rushes of adrenaline and wonder and the masochistic human need to subject themselves to something more powerful or terrifying or that which we can't entirely understand. And he still encourages this process if not in adults then in new generations who are for the first time dipping their toes into that great foreboding water. Because whatever you believe of his cinematic credibility or enjoyment, his indomitable presence cannot be understated. In that carnivorous madness, he not only ate the limbs of unfortunate swimmers, but of last legs of the old Hollywood machine and in that bloodied wake was born the summer blockbuster. In this enduring legacy he's an icon; a symbol of change and the cinematic talent that struck the hearts of enough filmgoers to bring about that. I caught this film on the TV a few weeks ago, about 10 minutes in, and put it on not so much out of a nostalgic indulgence but out of intellectual curiosity to see how I'd immediately respond to it with a mind freshened over the years since I'd last seen it. Within about five minutes, I'd downloaded the film and began watching from the beginning. I don't know what I expected. As much as this is the kind of film that you revisit frequently, playing memory hopscotch as you jump from scene to scene registering the quirks, quoting your favourite lines and waiting for those 'big' moments, whether a scare or some catharsis or triumph of character, it's still ultimately a Spielberg film and that means there's always more to discover each and every time. Great cinema is timeless yes, but his name almost guarantees the film will have a longer life expectancy. Being in a Spielberg film, we are of course almost immediately introduced to a family, and one that will be core to which the protagonist gravitates, because of course there's more than just the audience's composure on the line in this film, there's the family unit to maintain. I like how in Spielberg's '70s families exist somewhere between a 1950s nuclear family and the Wonder Years era of freedom and discord and strife that became more apparent in the domestic environment. Introducing our timeless Chief Brody, unwitting hero, the man whom I seem to recall earned much adoration from me as a child, wakes up alongside his wife, bathed in the radiant summer glow, checks the window to ascertain the whereabouts of his kids, and trades quips with his wife and then leaves. It's fairly standard stuff, but it's great in introducing the warm domestic heart of Amity, Brody's life, and the man himself. This is what is being threatened constantly throughout the film, and we take much delight in that. Chief Brody is a perfect character with which to embark on this adventure, because he's neither particularly macho or domineering or timid and inhibited. He's played by Roy Schieder with both composure and hesitance, his glasses and his patience carry a bookish reticence to him, but he's also firm and resolute, like every good hero, and I dedicate this paragraph to him because I've always been drawn to the guy. I think as a child I had some sort of Freudian complex with his character, because to me he always emanated paternal qualities. Glasses, cigarette and black turtleneck are eminently respectable. Perhaps the wife, is a little underdeveloped, as she's really more of figure of quiet domestic life, and extension of Brody's family responsibility than much of a character herself, and maybe some of Amity itself, like the Mayor (played with shady-contempt and-a-thin-façade-of -beach-front- good-guy-with-that-bloody-sports-coat-of-his by Murray Hamilton who I actually recognised from an episode of the Twilight Zone), is a little underexplored, who insists on keeping the beaches open, innumerable times, despite his children also being there, but then, Spielberg knows to keep this film focused on the actual terror driving its way through the narrative, and that all the other stuff is there to keep us involved in the world and actually care beyond visceral thrill, but not start wondering in-depth about it all. It's a tight picture, and like Aliens what is does is initially suggest at the terror, which we know is there but can't be certain of, introduce us to the characters and see their dynamics unfold naturally, all whilst the tension slowly coils up, then thrusts these characters into danger, as that tension snaps violently in our faces. People may be surprised how little Jaws is actually seen, as the film taunts us with his presence and consequence but not a physical sighting and in one case the carnivorous beast becomes a floating pier, which is simultaneously hilarious and terrifying. Of course the immortal dynamic of this film is in the troublesome trio of Brody, Hooper and Quint, the latter two played by Richard Dreyfuss and Robert Shaw. The former is an animated dramatic-exposition- unloader, played to a wonderful point where he almost seems unhinged in his love of sharks, and the latter really needs little introduction, except to say that the monologue never diminishes in power, partly because Shaw in playing such a haggard and crude man is utterly arresting when he's quiet and haunted, and the silence that hangs over that seen is so heavy, and it's both a brilliant move in humanising a character and furthering the horrific mythology and possibility of this shark, and thus the sense of dread that becomes so palpable.

In this enduring legacy he's an icon; a symbol of change and the cinematic talent that struck the hearts of enough filmgoers to bring about that. I caught this film on the TV a few weeks ago, about 10 minutes in, and put it on not so much out of a nostalgic indulgence but out of intellectual curiosity to see how I'd immediately respond to it with a mind freshened over the years since I'd last seen it. Within about five minutes, I'd downloaded the film and began watching from the beginning. I don't know what I expected. As much as this is the kind of film that you revisit frequently, playing memory hopscotch as you jump from scene to scene registering the quirks, quoting your favourite lines and waiting for those 'big' moments, whether a scare or some catharsis or triumph of character, it's still ultimately a Spielberg film and that means there's always more to discover each and every time. Great cinema is timeless yes, but his name almost guarantees the film will have a longer life expectancy. Being in a Spielberg film, we are of course almost immediately introduced to a family, and one that will be core to which the protagonist gravitates, because of course there's more than just the audience's composure on the line in this film, there's the family unit to maintain. I like how in Spielberg's '70s families exist somewhere between a 1950s nuclear family and the Wonder Years era of freedom and discord and strife that became more apparent in the domestic environment. Introducing our timeless Chief Brody, unwitting hero, the man whom I seem to recall earned much adoration from me as a child, wakes up alongside his wife, bathed in the radiant summer glow, checks the window to ascertain the whereabouts of his kids, and trades quips with his wife and then leaves. It's fairly standard stuff, but it's great in introducing the warm domestic heart of Amity, Brody's life, and the man himself. This is what is being threatened constantly throughout the film, and we take much delight in that. Chief Brody is a perfect character with which to embark on this adventure, because he's neither particularly macho or domineering or timid and inhibited. He's played by Roy Schieder with both composure and hesitance, his glasses and his patience carry a bookish reticence to him, but he's also firm and resolute, like every good hero, and I dedicate this paragraph to him because I've always been drawn to the guy. I think as a child I had some sort of Freudian complex with his character, because to me he always emanated paternal qualities. Glasses, cigarette and black turtleneck are eminently respectable. Perhaps the wife, is a little underdeveloped, as she's really more of figure of quiet domestic life, and extension of Brody's family responsibility than much of a character herself, and maybe some of Amity itself, like the Mayor (played with shady-contempt and-a-thin-façade-of -beach-front- good-guy-with-that-bloody-sports-coat-of-his by Murray Hamilton who I actually recognised from an episode of the Twilight Zone), is a little underexplored, who insists on keeping the beaches open, innumerable times, despite his children also being there, but then, Spielberg knows to keep this film focused on the actual terror driving its way through the narrative, and that all the other stuff is there to keep us involved in the world and actually care beyond visceral thrill, but not start wondering in-depth about it all. It's a tight picture, and like Aliens what is does is initially suggest at the terror, which we know is there but can't be certain of, introduce us to the characters and see their dynamics unfold naturally, all whilst the tension slowly coils up, then thrusts these characters into danger, as that tension snaps violently in our faces. People may be surprised how little Jaws is actually seen, as the film taunts us with his presence and consequence but not a physical sighting and in one case the carnivorous beast becomes a floating pier, which is simultaneously hilarious and terrifying. Of course the immortal dynamic of this film is in the troublesome trio of Brody, Hooper and Quint, the latter two played by Richard Dreyfuss and Robert Shaw. The former is an animated dramatic-exposition- unloader, played to a wonderful point where he almost seems unhinged in his love of sharks, and the latter really needs little introduction, except to say that the monologue never diminishes in power, partly because Shaw in playing such a haggard and crude man is utterly arresting when he's quiet and haunted, and the silence that hangs over that seen is so heavy, and it's both a brilliant move in humanising a character and furthering the horrific mythology and possibility of this shark, and thus the sense of dread that becomes so palpable.

But he's long since broken free of that frame, assuming he ever needed to. He is a harbinger of fear, that great primal substance that sent people scurrying from their televisions, from their beaches and from any signs of water in 1975, and brought them back again in their rushes of adrenaline and wonder and the masochistic human need to subject themselves to something more powerful or terrifying or that which we can't entirely understand. And he still encourages this process if not in adults then in new generations who are for the first time dipping their toes into that great foreboding water.

Chances are that you already know the man, even if you've never seen the movies; Bond's image and swagger have permeated through pop culture for the past five decades, crafting the classic archetype and stereotype of a British special agent (look no further than Austin Powers, Archer, or Kingsman for many fine examples of how far and how long the Bond image has persevered). He is timelessly appealing through his smooth combination of charm, sophistication, and ruthlessness.Dr. No introduces us to the rough and romantic adventures of Bond. It's nowhere near as action-packed as other movies in the series, but its simplicity as a spy thriller is what makes it elegant. There are just a few fights and chases; when they happen, they are modestly satisfying and thrilling. Most of the film's appeal will be in the smaller details; the way Bond dives into the mystery and sidesteps henchmen at every turn is expert and cool. It gradually builds up to an outlandish climax, in which Bond confronts the titular Dr. No in his secret lair, and has to stop his evil schemes. This becomes the fundamental template for future Bond films, but Dr. No stands out with its fair share of iconic scenes, including Bond's introduction during a game of Baccarat, a certain scene at a beach where Honey Rider makes her appearance, and a memorable dinner scene with the villain.The story follows after Ian Fleming's novel faithfully, although many parts of the story are changed. The story unfolds pretty neatly, gradually introducing the audience to Bond, the various characters he encounters, and the exotic world he inhabits. The plot has a satisfying structure, filled with just enough thrills and mystery to keep it moving. Even though Bond himself is an alluring character, most of the people in the film are one-dimensional; hardly anything is revealed about their motivations to make them stand out above the definitions of their archetypes. However, they all have a worthy presence and are likable to some degree. The film overall plays out as a fine piece of adventure and escapism, but it's only a small taste of even greater things to come.The film sports very good photography and editing. Acting is swell; Sean Connery is perfectly charismatic and iconic as James Bond, embodying all the right aspects to make his character shine even to this day. Joseph Wiseman is pretty stiff and robotic as the villain, but for interesting effect. I felt Ursula Andress was somewhat unlikable in her role; she's best seen for her looks. I enjoyed the performances of Jack Lord and most other players. Writing is not too shabby. This production uses very exotic and interesting locales. Sets, props, and costumes are quite old-fashioned, but still very slick. The music score features a lot of really funky calypso music, but Monty Norman's main theme is an instantly recognizable tune that resonates to this day.Dr. No is one slick thriller. Future Bond films will take the character to even more exciting adventures with even bigger stakes and bolder expressions, but this is the film that started it all, and it deserves a watch at least once.4\/5 (Entertainment Pretty Good | Story Good | Film Very Good) ","genre":null},{"date":"2 March 2015","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Not counting the 1954 made-for-TV rendition of Casino Royale, the film adaptation of Dr. No is where the cinematic saga of James Bond truly begins.

The movie takes place in England at a time where monarchy prevailed and divorce was frowned upon. The film also has a main theme saying that silence sometimes can be louder than words. The film may be character- driven, but it is certainly a fascinating study of this time period. As a history buff, I can appreciate the kind of art this film is. People may find this dry, but I find it fascinating. This film is about a man named Sir Thomas More and his infamous silence opposing the corrupt King Henry VIII when he ignored the Roman Catholic Church in regards to divorcing his wife Catherine in order to marry Anne Boleyn. The film has a fine cast and they all do an excellent job. Paul Scofield was masterful as Thomas More and he breathed life into his character as we, members of the audience, learned how big silence can be. Robert Shaw gave a likable, over-the-top performance as King Henry VIII. Orson Welles delivered a fine performance as the cardinal. John Hurt, in one of his early roles, was great as the young Rich. Overall, A Man for All Seasons makes for a fine history lesson. Being somewhat familiar with this time period, I was able to gain more in- depth information about the kind of man Sir Thomas More was. The script was dialog heavy, but I felt like that was appropriate for the kind of film it is. I had a rich experience watching the movie and I hope others can appreciate this history lesson.

This is the story of Secundo and Primo, a tight pair of Italian brothers who run an intimate Italian bistro in 1950's Brookyln who are facing bankruptcy until a business associate, so impressed with their food, promises to have his good friend, jazz musician Louis Prima, come to the restaurant for dinner and it is the preparations for this big night that send the brothers and everyone in their orbit into a tailspin. This joyous celebration of everything that is Italian-American completely envelops you with an almost voyeuristic atmosphere and characters who vividly touch your soul.The brothers are flawlessly played by one of our most solid and underrated character actors, the brilliant Stanley Tucci and Monk's Tony Shaloub and neither actor has ever been more appealing on screen. Tucci's Secundo is smart, sexy, charismatic, and generous of soul and Shaloub's Primo is an arrogant boob who always remains likable. Tucci co-wrote and directed this gem with actor Campbell Scott, who also appears briefly as a slick-talking used car salesman and Tucci and Scott's one scene together is a standout, but it is the atmosphere and rich characterizations that take center stage here...Ian Holm steals every scene he is in as the brothers' benefactor and Minnie Driver, Isabella Rosellini, and Allison Janney are impressive as the women in the brothers' lives. This movie is a joy from start to finish and made me wish that I was Italian. If you've never seen this one, please, treat yourself...and don't see it while you're hungry!

Not a good way, I think, to start a human-interest drama. But then, Shelley Winters supplies her own brand of whiny low-comedy as the sex-starved Charlotte. Then too, many of her pointless scenes with Humbert add up to a further drag. So, by the time Humbert and Lolita take off together, his thematic obsession with the sex-kitten is severely diluted.

On one hand, when Chinese elements, such as jade cups and Li-zhen's Qipao, are intertwine with western elements, such as Spanish songs and western food, the social context of Hong Kong is then artfully revealed, for Hong Kong was under the influence of the United Kingdom but located within China. On the other hand, the exotic and semi-joyful feeling of the song conveys a sense of uncertainty and desire between the two characters. As they both are deeply hurt due to their spouses' betrayal, they yearn for a genuine relationship which could rescue them from their sorrow. However, since such a relationship is morally forbidden, while they desperately want to embrace each other, they also intentionally keep each other at a distance to avoid hurting each other. In another scene, as Mo-wan is waiting for Li-zhen in a hotel, Li-zhen first arrives at the hotel but eventually chooses to leave. The song playing in the background is Cole's Quizas, Quizas, Quizas, meaning perhaps, perhaps, perhaps. Both the tile and the melody of the song indicate the fate of their subtle, splendid and yet fragile love the beauty of the love could only stay in a specific period of time with a particular group of people. Everything at that time could trigger their best memories, and everything at that time was in uncertainty. As Mo-wan once said to his buddy, the secrets of the past are forever buried under a handful of clay. ","genre":"Drama, Romance"}]
