It uses different techniques to bring upon compelling material in an audience. These techniques are fresh and entertaining, but do not necessarily allow this film to have the chance to be a standout movie in its gender. So there you have it, an avowed overview of the content of this review a film that stands as good, but is still nothing to get exited about.The picture stars Matt Damon as Rudy Baylor, a novice lawyer who has just recently finished  law school. His character narrates the film, and at times, explains a little too much of the story to us. He has chosen to become a lawyer not because of his father, who used to beat him and his mother up, but because it has been his lifelong dream to become one. In fact, he is so desperate for work, Rudy excepts a job from a corporate fraud in which the only other standing attorney in his firm is a short and suspicious man named Deck Schifflet. The two of them soon become partners forming their own independent law firm with next to zero cash in hand. The next step in forming an attorney? Finding a client. And that is exactly what Rudy and Deck intend to do. The two of them stumble opon an insurance company scandal featuring a young man dying of a curable disease, with his parent's near bankruptcy restricting him from receiving treatment. Rudy claim's the insurance company refused to pay them medical insurance. The company claims it was all a misunderstanding. The fat cat lawyer in charge of the defense is Leo F. Drummond, who is played perfectly by Jon Voight, who has about a dozen other powerful attorney's representing his client as well. During a particularly effective scene where the two opposing sides meet to discuss matters at banquette room, we see the prosecution in the hands of inexperienced Rudy alone, representing an underdog in over his head. While the defense side represents ignorance and experienced power by expressing many experienced and mighty lawyers. This scene serves as a golden moment in the film.The film offers a good, constant point of view through Damon's position. Before the movie is over, he'll induce a love story that belongs in a different film. In it he helps eliminate the troubles of a young woman. Even as this romantic subplot distracts our attention away from our main focus, the big trial case of insurance fraud, the movie manages, through a distinct view point, to overcome this problem and turn it into something engaging. Matt Damon is a little shaky in his leading role here. But then again, under the circumstances, his character should be a little on the nervous side.The success of The Rainmaker' is backed up with a cast of confidence. As I've already said, Damon is somewhat iffy in his role, but Danny DeVito, his accomplice, offers hilarity and relief. Young actress Claire Danes is at home here as well, appropriately portraying her character with confusion and hardship. Veteran actor Jon Voight offers just the right amount of overpowering material to allow his character to challenge the audience. And even the minor role from Danny Glover, as the main judge, has some fun with his character. Overall, The Rainmaker covers fresh ground in its gender of trial dramas. It has a lot of fun with its plot, and is held together with consistency and a firm structure. The story is at first a bit unconvincing, but before the end of the production, it is as involving as A Civil Action (1998), or even Night Falls on Manhattan, (1997). Although clearly not as good as that film, or many others, it is still a prevailing attempt at an overly familiar subject.Brought to you by Paramount Pictures and Constellation Films.
