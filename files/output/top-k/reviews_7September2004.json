[{"date":"7 September 2004","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":"  'Rounders', directed by John Dahl and starring Matt Damon and Edward Norton, deals with two childhood friends who are poker players; Worm (Norton) has just gotten out of prison and is content with being a small-time hustler who has to dig himself out of the hole he got into with debtors before he went into prison. Mike McDermott (Damon) is his buddy who, after losing all of his money in one hand to KGB (John Malkovich) nine months prior, has decided to get out of the cards racket and concentrate on law school; more to please his girlfriend than anything. Of course, within ten minutes of picking Worm up from prison, he is back to playing cards, and his girlfriend promptly leaves him. In a bid to save both of their necks, Worm and Mike must earn 15K in five days, so they do what they know best, play poker.The biggest problem with 'Rounders' is that it tries to create a multi-faceted story where there really is nothing but poker playing as a plot. The audience is supposed to contemplate the bonds of friendship, the struggle in relationships, etc. but these plot lines are so weak in favor of the poker playing that the film would have been better off had these elements not been introduced at all. Instead, there are many plot holes and a couple of moments where I was left saying 'So what?' The poker scenes were indeed very interesting and well done; they probably should have been either expanded on or toned down a bit in favor of stronger and more clearly defined conflict lines in terms of the supporting story. Having said that, the acting in 'Rounders' was quite good &#150; Matt Damon was, well he was 'Matt Damon' and Edward Norton, who is always good, was good as the degenerate hustler. The greatest acting, however unsurprising as it is at this point, was the small but effective role of KGB, played by Malkovich.He is virtually unrecognizable beneath baggy clothes and a big beard, and his accent, though I'm not an authority, was flawless. Malkovich is best in his small, quirky roles, and this was absolutely no exception. His acting was the high point of the film, despite the fact that he was on screen for perhaps fifteen minutes total. 'Rounders' is not a bad movie because of its flaws, but unfortunately its one-dimensionality makes it only a decent film. I liked its low-budget, art house feel, and I always have to respect an actor, no matter how big they are (though Damon and Norton weren't as prolific at this point) for being in an independent film. 'Rounders' isn't a great film, but it is an entertaining one.--Shelly  ","genre":null},{"date":"7 September 2004","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":"  'Rounders', directed by John Dahl and starring Matt Damon and Edward Norton, deals with two childhood friends who are poker players; Worm (Norton) has just gotten out of prison and is content with being a small-time hustler who has to dig himself out of the hole he got into with debtors before he went into prison.
