First and foremost, it has the edgy realism that began to slip away in the Kill Bill films (which I still very much praise and enjoy), and was completely discarded in his recent film Inglourious Basterds. It's like recently Tarantino let his fame go to his head and just went all out without thinking about if what he showed on screen made any real sense. This film of his, basically his first three, are the ones I admire the most. Not to mention the way the story is told, it's just very intriguing from the start. We see only brief glimpses of what actually happened at this bank job that apparently went very, very, bad. The cast was phenomenal throughout and this film had the chemistry to really make the tension play out realistically and brutally later on. The atmosphere is solid and full of well acted malice and is pretty unpredictable. In fact, amidst all the insane and gruesome scenes which some may struggle to sit through (Can you hear me now?)is a very nicely paced plot that in reality is probably one of the greatest crime\/thriller pieces ever written.The talent here is undeniable, and every performance is just awesome. The ones I really admired the most were that of Harvey Keitel as Mr. White, and definitely Steve Buscemi as Mr. Pink. And where as I believe every individual character stood out quite well, the two that stirred up the most in me was Tim Roth as the nefarious Mr. Orange, but over all Michael Madsen as the sadistic Mr. Blonde. I will never forget Madsen as the soda sipping psychopath. Tarantino does well himself I must admit, and kudos to the often over-looked performance of Kirk Baltz as the unfortunate Officer Marvin Nash.With its tremendously talented cast breathing life into these characters we know so little about, coupled with its very involving story and well placed music, it all comes together as arguably Tarantino's most refined work.

Then I grew up and quickly forgot everything I ever knew about him. Then along came a movie called Quiz Show, about the game show scandals of the 50's, where one of the plot points revolved around a game show question pertaining to this movie winning Best Picture and Ernest Borgnine winning Best Actor. And I thought to myself, is this made up? What could the guy from McHales Navy possibly do to win an Oscar for Best Actor? It seemed ridiculous. A fluke. Possibly made up for the movie Quiz Show. After passing up numerous opportunities to see this film over the last 40 plus years I finally saw it on TCM and I am schooled. Everyone in their lives, no matter how beautiful they are, or think they are, has felt like these characters at some point. It is the universal feeling of loneliness and alienation and it is explored thoughtfully and sympathetically here. It also explores the casualties of love. A daughter gets married, equals a Mother loses her son. A guy falls in love with a girl, equals his best friend loses companionship. Falling in love shifts everything around it and not always gently. Love is messy even at its borders. So here we have Ernest Borgnine and Esther Minciotti, son and Mother in the film, giving truly once in a lifetime performances in this tiny little movie. Their kindness towards each other, far beyond the script they're working from, is touching. Jerry Paris, pre Dick Van Dyke show, is remarkable as another son with his own set of relationship problems. The sarge from Gomer Pyle is in this too. It's a proverbial cavalcade of upcoming '60's television. But at it's heart it is a touching movie that everyone should see. I wish I hadn't waited so long. Ernest Borgnine was given the chance of a lifetime to play Marty. Though terrific in everything he ever did, nothing before or after Marty gave him the opportunity to show what a truly gifted actor he is. Thank God someone was smart enough to cast him.

The problem is the last 45 minutes seems far too rushed for comfort. Ben's stalking of Elaine in Berkeley, her marriage subplot etc. could've been taken slower & the first hour with Mrs.Robinson could've been cut short but of course, that would've changed the movie for better & worse. On the bright side, the parting shot is one of the best remembered moments in film history although you could attribute it more to Hoffman & Ross.

Don't worry, I'm not some crazy auteurist; I'm not talking about themes or symbolism, just the changing relationship between the camera and the material. In 1970 Akira Kurosawa suffered the disastrous commercial and critical failure of Dodesukaden, a picture he had poured a lot of his own funds into producing. Soon after this lifelong humanist made what we can assume was an earnest but thankfully unsuccessful suicide attempt. Dersu Uzala was his the picture he made next.Dersu Uzala is often categorised as an anomaly in the Kurosawa filmography anyway, as it was his only feature made outside his native Japan. This adaptation of a Russian explorer's memoir is a potentially serious departure for a director who previously wrote all his own scripts and always seemed to have his finger on the pulse of Japanese society. Still, the wilderness setting and interaction between humanity and landscape in the story ultimately makes this a tale that could be of any time or place. The largely Russian film crew seems particularly in tune with the Japanese director's sensibilities. The musical scoring by Isaak Shvarts has that beautiful haunting quality of Mussorgsky and Rimsky-Korsakov, which Kurosawa would no doubt have appreciated. His long-term director of photography Asakazu Nakai works with a pair of Russian cinematographers to great some wonderful images that have the warm softness of impressionist painting.This last point is particularly important for the late-period Kurosawa. He had long been an accomplished amateur painter, but never has this been more apparent in his film work than in Dersu Uzala. We now see in him a desire to create smooth tonal patterns for the screen, creating compositions that are primarily for aesthetic value, even something as mundane as the shot of sleeping soldiers before they meet Dersu, in which everything is arranged in harmonious diagonals. Howard Hawks once derided the widescreen format as being a bad move because it was a shape rarely chosen by painters, but Kurosawa manages perfectly with it.

Don't worry, I'm not some crazy auteurist; I'm not talking about themes or symbolism, just the changing relationship between the camera and the material. In 1970 Akira Kurosawa suffered the disastrous commercial and critical failure of Dodesukaden, a picture he had poured a lot of his own funds into producing. Soon after this lifelong humanist made what we can assume was an earnest but thankfully unsuccessful suicide attempt. Dersu Uzala was his the picture he made next.Dersu Uzala is often categorised as an anomaly in the Kurosawa filmography anyway, as it was his only feature made outside his native Japan. This adaptation of a Russian explorer's memoir is a potentially serious departure for a director who previously wrote all his own scripts and always seemed to have his finger on the pulse of Japanese society. Still, the wilderness setting and interaction between humanity and landscape in the story ultimately makes this a tale that could be of any time or place. The largely Russian film crew seems particularly in tune with the Japanese director's sensibilities. The musical scoring by Isaak Shvarts has that beautiful haunting quality of Mussorgsky and Rimsky-Korsakov, which Kurosawa would no doubt have appreciated. His long-term director of photography Asakazu Nakai works with a pair of Russian cinematographers to great some wonderful images that have the warm softness of impressionist painting.This last point is particularly important for the late-period Kurosawa. He had long been an accomplished amateur painter, but never has this been more apparent in his film work than in Dersu Uzala. We now see in him a desire to create smooth tonal patterns for the screen, creating compositions that are primarily for aesthetic value, even something as mundane as the shot of sleeping soldiers before they meet Dersu, in which everything is arranged in harmonious diagonals.

As she starts to get to know the town the birds mysteriously attack in force. The Birds might well be the first official nature-runs-amok flick, which were made hugely popular a dozen years later with the release of Jaws, the film that opened the Pandora's box to creatures-on-the-loose flicks. I believe The Birds should be enjoyed at face value as a simple story of birds mysteriously attacking a coastal hamlet, but a more allegorical interpretation is that Melanie (Hedren) represents modern ideas that attempt to infect the rural communities where people live and think in a simpler, more conservative way. The village is not ready to accept and incorporate these new concepts and so nature itself attempts to vomit out the infection, irregardless of hometown damage and casualties. Yet this interpretation seems to be rejected by the film itself in the restaurant scene where the mother with two kids hysterically rebukes Melanie for supposedly causing the bird attacks; when Melanie slaps the mother, this irrational notion is 'slapped' out of the viewer as well, as if to say, That's stupid. Melanie is not the cause of this, literally or figuratively. WHAT DOESN'T WORK (supposedly) - For the better part of an hour the story plays out as a slow drama, which will likely turn off those with ADHD. Personally, I find this approach refreshing in light of the frenetic editing and absurd action sequences of modern blockbusters. Films like The Birds seem almost daring by comparison; in fact, it's startling. Besides, the beautiful Bodega Bay photography provides some nice backdrop eye-candy to help maintain one's attention with the soap operatics.- One obvious plot hole is Why do Melanie, the schoolmarm and the kids flee the schoolhouse? Wouldn't it be wiser to simply blockade themselves in an inner room with no windows? Or maybe there isn't such an interior room big enough to fit all the kids; after all, it appears to be a fairly small schoolhouse.- Complaints about Melanie's supposedly lame prank on Mitch (Taylor) are nitpicking at best; and criticisms of Melanie foolishly searching for the source of a mysterious sound -- even though she must know what it is -- can easily be chalked up to curiosity killing the cat (for instance, while stopping by Point Pleasant, WV, on vacation in 2005 I went into an old abandoned building that used to be a home for troubled kids back in the day; my wife refused to go any where near the creepy domicile but I HAD to go in and look around; even the satanic graffiti and shocked birds flying out the windows didn't deter me!).- After recently seeing films like the remake of Dawn of the Dead and The Exorcism of Emily Rose, I can hardly find The Birds horrifying, although I certainly find it very entertaining. Really, the creepiest aspect of the movie is Mitch's hovering, suspicious mother, played by Jessica Tandy -- whoa, is she scary.- The age difference of Mitch and his sister seems off. Taylor (Mitch) was 33 years-old during filming, although he looks to be more like 40 or older, but his sister in the story (Veronica Cartwright) was only 13. That's a twenty-year difference. I could see her being his daughter, but his sister? Also, if Veronica is 13 that means his creepy mother had sex a mere 13 years before -- and that's a really scary thought! WHAT WORKS - As noted above, the slow dialogue-driven drama of the first hour is actually appealing in light of the modern glut of moronic cgi-laden, frenetically-edited drivel, not to mention the awesome coastal Northern California cinematography.- Viewing the film is like going back in time to the early 60s. It's entertaining to see the clothing and decor styles, as well as social interactions, etc.- Although I don't find Tippi sexy, I do enjoy her facial expressions. I know this is an odd comment, but she does have that Paul Stanley pouty lips rockstar expression down pat.- Suzanne Pleshette's in the cast -- now SHE's sexy.- There are numerous memorable and thrilling sequences -- the various bird attacks, the guy with no eye balls, the phone booth scene, etc. I also enjoyed the interesting discussion on birds in the diner sequence.- !!END SPOILER!!

Their job to collect the screams of little children. Screams are what power Monstropolis, so every night the monsters must enter the world of humans in order to scare the children as they fall asleep.But the children are not the only ones being scared. The monsters believe that children are poisonous and that just one touch from a human child will kill them. So when a two year-old girl follows Sulley back through her closet door into Monstropolis, the monsters' world is turned upside down.The Good As with many Pixar films, friendship and looking out for others is a major part of this story. The relationship that grows between Sulley and Boo is very sweet and he goes to great lengths to keep her safe. This is a wonderful example of what we should be willing to do to protect widows, orphans, and all those weaker than ourselves. Also noticeable was the contrast between good and evil and the lesson that laughter and joy are more powerful than fear.The Bad This film is very clean. Besides a few monster kisses and one use of the word darn, there's really nothing offensive here. One thing parents of young children may want to keep in mind, however, is the fact that the film is about monsters who come out at night and scare little children. While this is resolved nicely in the end, some young children may find a film about monsters to be more scary than funny.Conclusion While Monsters, Inc. may not be a very deep film, it is an extremely entertaining one! If you're looking for a delightful way to spend an evening, and you are not afraid of monsters, Monsters, Inc. may just fit the bill.

The film takes clear glee in tossing a young American girl head first into a fierce cauldron within a foreign place further still within a foreign nation, plunging her into the pouring rain that greets her as she makes her way beyond the international boundaries marked by way of an airport's exit and then into what will come to form a bleak proverbial mire. The howling wind and driving rain makes it tough to keep dry and retain a normalised, balanced look; she drags her luggage through the conditions made tougher with little in the way of other people around to help; then, upon tyring to obtain access to a taxi, she is shunned by the mechanical-like driving past of various cabs until, finally, one stops to pick her up. Salvation? Not really - even communication with the driver is difficult through the language barrier.Once at her destination, you'd think the worst of it was over; the trekking out from where she's from and limping through the initially difficult stages of getting there only to, at last, get to where it is she's going. Not so, as further confusion over the intercom at the entrance to the locale follows, before a girl not that much older flees from the door in an hysterical and garbled mess. Away from what the lead female is able to witness, but perversely informing a continuously watching audience thus informing us and not her that something is definitely wrong with this place, someone or something catches up with the escapee, and she is dispatched in a less than pretty display. There begins 1977 film Suspiria, and the two key items that will come to act as foundations for the film; namely, that notion of a young woman being in a foreign locale in which she will struggle or suffer hardships, along with the catalyst in the form of overlying terror and unnerving ambiguity, particularly in regards to the mystery as to what's actually unravelling behind the scenes in this place.The film is one of such which revolves around a girl in a location she has every right to be wary of and initially struggle through before getting a grip on the situation and rising to what it offers. Jessica Harper plays the lead, a young and fragile looking American named Suzy Bannion. She's a dancer, one of whom has showed such promise in recent times back home that enrolling at a prestigious school in West Germany beckons; that notion of, not West Germany, but Europe in general being a locale of both culture and academia rearing its head once again &#x96; when intelligent American characters need to journey somewhere so as to study something at a higher level, Europe always seems to be the place they either travel to or strive to travel to.After night-set shooting and blood red hues dominating the frame during Suzy's arrival and the young girl's death, we are greeted by fresher, bluer and more welcoming tones the following morning. All appears well at the dance school, the employees are welcoming and quick to dismiss any of the foulness raised from the previous night. The other girls appear in relatively stark contrast to Suzy, her one confidant in Sara (Casini) already at a stage in her own paranoia which will see things on that particular strand effectively unravel later on. The school comes across as somewhat of a female dominated zone, one female student encapsulating the feminine empowerment at the place in her strutting around a dormitory room whilst bare legged and whilst in a loose white gown of some description, wielding cigarette holders in a sultry and fetishistic manner. The male students few-and-far between amidst all the female ones, and the school is a place in which most of the men appear to do either the menial work or exist to purely serve the woman in some form. One of these men arrives in the form of an apparently mute Romanian butler, a male charged with moving items to and from locations therein in an unfussy and subdued manner, while a blind pianist must play what he is told to until he himself can take it no longer and is then punished for his disobedient transgressions.Suzy's eventual clashing with the school in this and mostly every regard is seemingly obligatory, Argento's film a very gradual; bleak, brooding and ruthlessly effective little number covering substantial ground in both the thriller, horror and mystery genres. The entire film arrives with a pumping and pulsating musical score upon which first heard appears to be a chorus of Islamic prayers acting as a coating to some high pitched breathing and gasping, all the while accompanied by blaring bursts of throbbing acoustic guitar combining wonderfully and acting as a fantastic over-tune to proceedings. The film builds to a quite chilling culmination, the notion of building and brooding your way to something and providing us with an attentive enough attitude towards character evident and working with the film as it concludes with a large payoff; there is nary a sign of dunderheaded schlock frills for eighty minutes before the cheap wrapping of everything off. Suspiria is good fun, a playful and well made little film delivering on a number of levels as it covers its lead's descent into the uncanny unknown.

Broccoli and Harry Saltzman present. Suddenly the dots turn into the insides of a gun-barrel with a well dressed man wearing a hat walking along, the gun-barrel following his steps. Suddenly the man turns and fires a gun towards the audience, blood flowing down the inside of the gun-barrel just as a soon to be iconic piece of music begins to play. This of course is the iconic opening of the first James Bond movie Dr. No nearly fifty years ago. With Dr. No, a movie that cost a little more then a million dollars to make and featured a cast of relative nobodies, a movie franchise was launched. Looking back nearly fifty years, and twenty-two movies later, how well does this opening hold up? Perhaps the thing that holds up the most is Sean Connery's debut as James Bond. From the moment he says his first line leading into perhaps the most famous introduction in movie history, the then unknown actor becomes James Bond. Connery's Bond is a Bond who can be believable in a tuxedo at the beginning of the movie, fine suits throughout much of the rest of the movie yet beaten and roughed up towards the end. This is a Bond who is seductive and charming towards any woman he meets yet cold-blooded with a sharp wit. As a result, this is a hero who is utterly believable yet somehow fantastic at the same time and Connery gives the part that quality.This is all the more important since Connery is without two Bond movie elements the Bond girl and the villain. Ursula Andress as Honey Ryder finally appears 62 minutes into a 109 minute movie while Joseph Wiseman as the title villain, Dr. No doesn't make an on screen appearance until there's only 25 minutes left (in a shot of his hands and legs!). While neither role is particularly large, both Andress and Wiseman make the most of their appearances. These range from Honey's now iconic introduction to Wiseman's sparking dialogue with Connery's Bond. Both of them set the standard for all those who follow both for the 1960s and beyond.The supporting cast does a fine job as well. Making their debuts in the franchise are two later stalwarts of the series Bernard Lee as M and Lois Maxwell as the ever faithful Miss Moneypenny who both firmly establish their character's in the space of a few minutes. Helping out Bond on this first adventure is future Hawaii Five-O star Jack Lord as CIA agent Felix Leiter and John Kitzmuller as Quarrel, a role that seems both a bit racist and dated fifty years on but one that Kitzmuller does a pretty good job with nonetheless. Rounding out the supporting cast are Anthony Dawson as Professor Dent, Eunice Gayson as Sylvia Trench, Peter Burton as Major Boothroyd (aka Q, the role that Desmond Llewelyn made famous), Louis Blaazer as British diplomat Pleydell-Smith and Zena Marshall as the mysterious Miss Taro. All around Dr. No is blessed with a fine supporting cast.Given that Dr. No effectively had a low budget, it looks splendid for its time. Ken Adams production design gives the movie a larger then life quality that perfectly suits the movie, even if it does get the design of a nuclear reactor just slightly wrong. The production design is aided immensely by the cinematography of Ted Moore which not only shows off Adams sets (such as the single shot that shows off Doctor No's dining room) but also gives the movie a strong sense of menace throughout. The editing of Peter Hunt keeps the movie moving in what could otherwise be dull moments. Even the limited amount of action sequences are well staged and stand up fairly well even now. There are also some good special effects in the form of model shots, those some of the back projection shots are just a bit too obvious. The score from Monty Norman also seems to be a bit lacking, especially with its repetitive use of the James Bond theme, though it has some effective moments such as the tarantula scene or the final confrontation between Bond and Doctor No. All of these elements, under the supervision of Terrance Young make for a film that stands out production value wise.Which brings us to the script. Adapted from Ian Fleming's sixth James Bond novel, the script is for the most part faithful to the original novel though it does lose perhaps the most cinematic sequence of the novel. The plot and the villain's plot are perhaps simplistic compared to some of the world threatening ones of later movies of the series agent 007 is sent to Jamaica to investigate the disappearance of a British agent who was investigating the potential sabotaging of American rocket launches (keep in mind this was 1962 and the space race was still in full swing). It is the script that also dates the film most heavily. It is the casual racism used towards the Jamaican character's, especially with Quarrel and Bond's interactions with him, that do that the most. Those moments, like Quarrel's belief in a dragon on Doctor No's island or taking Bond's command to fetch my shoes, are cringe worthy today and help to show how far not just Bond but perhaps the world has come in nearly fifty years.Despite some flaws, Doctor No holds up well. From Sean Connery's perfect debut as Bond to the effective performances of the rest of the cast and good production values that hold up well decades later.

Basically it is set in the modern day, focusing on the world of America's growing war on drugs, seeing the users and addicts, the narcotics trade, and of course those trying to fight against it, using multi-strand storytelling and three main plots connected in subtle ways. Robert Wakefield (Michael Douglas), a Supreme Court judge from Ohio, has appointed a new drug tsar for his nation, but his position is made daunting when he discovers his teenage own daughter Caroline (Erika Christensen) is addicted to cocaine (and maybe some other drugs). Montel Gordon (Don Cheadle) and Ray Castro (Luis Guzmán) are DEA agents pursuing Helena Ayala (Golden Globe nominated Catherine Zeta-Jones), the wife of kingpin husband Carlos (Steven Bauer) who is in jail, as she takes over his business, including of course the involvement of drugs. Javier Rodriguez (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe winning Benicio Del Toro) is a corrupt but dedicated police constable in Mexico who struggles to make the right decisions when he finds out his boss may not be against the drugs market. Also starring Dennis Quaid as Arnie Metzger, Clifton Collins Jr. as Francisco Flores, Miguel Ferrer as Eduardo Ruiz, Topher Grace as Seth Abrahms, Amy Irving as Barbara Wakefield, D.W. Moffett as Jeff Sheridan, Albert Finney as Chief of Staff, James Brolin as General Ralph Landry, The Mask's Peter Riegert as Attorney Michael Adler and Salma Hayek as Rosario. Douglas is good as the father struggling to control her daughter's crack habit, his wife Zeta-Jones is really good as the unknowing and concerned pregnant wife of a gangster, and of course Del Toro gave a calmer and sensitive performance rather than gritty villain like usual. Every once in a while one of the stories blends in to one of the others, only very slightly, it was a little hard to understand each story individually, but I understood some of what was going on, so from what I gathered, it is quite a worthwhile crime drama. It won the Oscars for Best Editing for Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material Previously Produced or Published, and it was nominated for Best Picture, it won the BAFTA for Best Adapted Screenplay, and it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Editing, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Screenplay, and it was nominated for Best Motion Picture - Drama.

Basically it is set in the modern day, focusing on the world of America's growing war on drugs, seeing the users and addicts, the narcotics trade, and of course those trying to fight against it, using multi-strand storytelling and three main plots connected in subtle ways. Robert Wakefield (Michael Douglas), a Supreme Court judge from Ohio, has appointed a new drug tsar for his nation, but his position is made daunting when he discovers his teenage own daughter Caroline (Erika Christensen) is addicted to cocaine (and maybe some other drugs). Montel Gordon (Don Cheadle) and Ray Castro (Luis Guzmán) are DEA agents pursuing Helena Ayala (Golden Globe nominated Catherine Zeta-Jones), the wife of kingpin husband Carlos (Steven Bauer) who is in jail, as she takes over his business, including of course the involvement of drugs. Javier Rodriguez (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe winning Benicio Del Toro) is a corrupt but dedicated police constable in Mexico who struggles to make the right decisions when he finds out his boss may not be against the drugs market.

That said, it's great to see Walter Matthau in a comedy from an era when comedic leads weren't forced to be maniacal slapstick stick figures&#x85; Matthau plays it cool and smart, which lends the film an extra touch of class.If the script had been re-written once or twice more with a focus on comedic tempo and extra punchlines, Hopscotch might be a classic. As it is there are simply too many minutes that slip by without any jokes, too many talky scenes featuring men in suits, sitting, and too much repetition How many times can we watch Matthau taunt his pursuers while they do slow burns in frustration?Sam Waterston makes an appearance in the film, proving that he was always 45 years old, and Ned Beatty plays some sort of furious bloated midget who somehow got to be head of the CIA.
