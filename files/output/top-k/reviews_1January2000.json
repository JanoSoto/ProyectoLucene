I remember coming out of the theater the night I saw it not knowing how to feel.  Should I laugh?  Should I cry?  Be happy or sad?  It was unbelievable!  The idea of a man's whole life being televised and scripted is certainly an original and creative one, and on the whole, an upsetting one.  It's hard for me to watch Truman Burbank, brilliantly played by Jim Carrey, suffer and be so blatantly deceived and lied to by those he crosses and even lives with.  He doesn't know that his whole life wasn't under his control, until things in the show don't quite go as planned.  A piece of equipment from the set falls from the sky, Truman bumps into his dead father who wandered into the set, and he learns his wife actually hates him.  What really upset me about the film was having to watch all those actors and actresses lie, betray, and deceive Truman.  Worse yet, the fans of the show are cold hearted and cruel enough to keep watching, even at the peak of Truman's suffering.  Of course, that's what people do with movies and TV, watch people go through their trials and tribulations, pains and sufferings.  The only difference here is that the star of the show isn't pretending.  Luckily, he takes action and initiates an escape, while the shows creator battles to keep him on the set.  Finally, in a devastating scene, Truman comes to terms with reality, that he never had a life.  Thankfully, it was redeemed when he proudly walked out of the set and ventured out into the world.  What you may not know is that The Truman Show is actually a film about God.  The creator's name is Christof, related to Christ, and he orchestrates every day of Truman's life.  Don't worry about tomorrow, because God has already taken care of it for you.  Also, I didn't think Christof was playing God.  I thought it a satirical way, he really was God.  He was the creator of a show that gave hope, joy, and inspiration to millions, as did God with the world and his son Jesus.  His wrath and anger was inflicted upon Truman when he tried to leave the set, or the Garden of Eden, and learn the truth about his life, thus receiving the fruit of knowledge.  Christof throws a violent, Biblical storm at Truman, and after Truman survives the storm, he screams out Is that the best you can do?, on his sailboat the Santa Maria, or the Holy Mary.  The ultimate is the ending, where Truman appears to be walking on water towards the stairway to Heaven, not knowing if he is dead or alive or if it's reality or nightmare.  Christof speaks to Truman through the clouds in a deep, God-like voice, telling him that he has been watching him his whole life.  Another aspect of Christof's God-like qualities is that he isn't actually evil, and all he wants is to do what he thinks is best for Truman.  In my world, you have nothing to fear.  A couple of times in the film, Christof pets Truman on the TV screen, a sign of gentleness and love.  Finally, Truman gracefully bows before God and walks out of the set, and into the unknown world, thus Adam and Eve leaving the Garden of Eden and venturing out into the real world.  The whole awesome power of the climax brought tears to my eyes on more than one occasion.  It's the first time in my life that a film could have such a strong, inspirational impact on me.  It really shook me up!  I was deeply upset that this film got a disappointing 2 Academy Award nomination, neither of which won.  Jim Carrey wasn't nominated, although looking back on his career as the rubberfaced maniac who talked out of his ass in Ace Ventura, it's amazing that he was even involved in such an earth shattering film, let alone play the main character.  But he did it.  He gave Truman a likeable, intelligent, curious, and sad quality.  I remember seeing the trailer for the first time in theaters and thinking, Oh boy.  Another Jim Carrey comedy.  How wrong I was!  This film was a serious, provocative, and inspirational one that put away all the laughter with the exception of the man in the bath tub.  I remember desperately trying not to cry at the climax, watching Truman bang on the wall of the set, learning in a painful instant, the reality of his life.  What would have been really sad is if he never escaped, although an ending like that would be pointless, because the message and the meaning would be lost.  Hopefully, the AFI(American Film Institute) will put this on their list as one of the best films ever made, which I strongly would stand up for and believe it to be true in every sense of the word!

Anthony Perkins in Psycho could be another, if you consider him a villain. But when someone mentions Matt Damon, you don't really picture him being a memorable villain in a movie. That is, until you've seen The Talented Mr. Ripley.The Talented Mr. Ripley begins when Tom Ripley (Matt Damon in his best performance yet), borrows a Princeton blazer to play piano at a rooftop party in Manhattan. Tom tells us in a monolog that the whole thing started with the borrowing of the blazer, and he's right. A rich couple see Tom wearing the blazer and assume that since he supposedly went to Princeton, that he must know their son, Dickie Greenleaf. Tom agrees with them with them on this.The couple are concerned about their son, Dickie, who has moved to Europe and doesn't plan on coming back home. The father of Dickie, Mr. Greenleaf makes a deal with Tom Ripley They will pay him $1,000 if he can bring their son back from Europe. They will even finance his trip to Europe.Once Tom arrives in Europe, he meets Dickie and his girlfriend, Marge Sherwood (Gwyneth Paltrow). Dickie doesn't remember Tom from Princeton, but he accepts him anyway. It is apparent early on in the movie that Tom wants to be Dickie Greenleaf. His talent is that he can impersonate just about anyone, from their voice, down to their signature. In an early scene in the movie, Dickie asks Tom what his talents are, Tom replies Forging signatures, telling lies and impersonating almost anyone.Tom then proceeds to tell Dickie why he has come to Europe. Dickie does not want to go back to America, instead, he and Tom become best friends, or brothers, they start to do things together every day. Then comes along a friend of Dickie's named Freddie Miles (Philip Seymour Hoffman). Tom notices that Freddie has come between him and Dickie. That is the furthest I will go into the plot, so I don't spoil anything that I already haven't.The movie works for several reasons. First of all, everyone in the movie gives excellent performances. Even pretty boy Matt Damon, who I could never see as a villain, does a remarkable job of being creepy in his role as Tom Ripley. Gwyneth Paltrow gives another great performance to follow her last one in Shakespeare in Love. The movie is also very entertaining at times, and at some parts, even has you rooting for Tom Ripley, the villain of the movie.

Although there has been much written about Jimmy Stewart not deserving the Oscar that year, if it was given for the Academy passing over his performance in Mr Smith Goes to Washington, then it was well deserved. Cary Grant deserved a nomination, and Kate definitely should have taken out the prize for the year. I could be going to extremes, but I think this was definitely the movie that deserved to take home the statuette for Best Picture of 1940. I have seen both Rebecca and The Grapes of Wrath, movies highly acclaimed that year, but neither has ever come close to The Philadelphia Story. The first time I watched it I missed not only most of the witty one-liners, but the whole point of the story. It was the first movie I watched with each of the three stars. Almost a year later after I viewed it again I couldn't believe how I could have passed over such a rare gem. As a fourteen year old, I can't be pretentious in definitely knowing the real themes of the movie. Maybe something in the way of humility and degrees of acceptance, I'm not so sure. I have thought about it a lot, but have only reached the conclusion that it is one of those 'feel good' movies that is re-watchable. There are things about it, even close to my tenth viewing, that I am still picking up on.

Yes it is based on a script by Tarantino and directed by Robert Rodriguez, both not easily accepted as 'high-art' directors and by the Academy. Who cares ? Just ask yourself as to how many times since Hitchcock's 'Psycho' has one seen a plot jerk as unexpectedly into a totally different vein as in this movie. For those who complain that a gritty gangster story suddenly turns into a fantastic horror saloon brawl - that is exactly what makes this movie so good.

The Cider House Rules is gorgeous to look at, providing a real feel for the seasons and the beauty of Maine; its gorgeous close-ups reveal the heart of the characters.       The Cider House Rules is simple and subtle.  It doesn't provide a treatise on abortion, its rights and wrongs, nor does it actually SHOW you the gory details.  Instead, you see the faces of the doctors and patients reacting to the process, like Mr. Rose's horrified face as he watches his daughter put through it.  You feel how grotesque abortion can be, even for a doctor like Larch in favor of it, his anger and addiction to ether revealing his own repulsion for the procedure.  Irving's characters and scenes show rather than tell, which I suppose is the secret of the miracle of moving from printed page to silver screen.  I am personally and politically pro-choice, but at the same time I'm against the death penalty.  One runs into a lot of conflict for holding these two seemingly contradictory positions let the guilty felon live for he is a human being, but the innocent child may be sacrificed.  This film brought up that moral conflict in me once more.         However, the Cider House Rules is not meant to be so controversial.  It is meant to stir emotions and compassion, which it does incredibly well.  Tobey Maguire, Michael Caine, Delroy Lindo, and Erykah Badu all do fantastic work with their characters, miraculously bringing out the humanity of people who perform acts that many of us would find morally corrupt, incest, adultery, abortion, yet they force our compassion instead of our criticism.      I don't think the Cider House Rules will receive any big award in the end except perhaps Best Adapted Screenplay, which it certainly merits.

Atticus Finch is the country attorney who takes on the defence of Tom Robinson.  Atticus is a well-respected man, but lawin' fer niggers is not going to make life in Maycomb County easy for him or his family.     To Kill A Mockingbird is one of the best, and best-selling, American novels of the twentieth century, and hardly needs any introduction here.  The story is recounted by Scout, Atticus' tomboy daughter, who is six years old at the time of the events which she describes.  Her adored older brother Jem is her constant companion, and the narrative evokes (in both book and film) the distinctive world of childhood.    When I first saw the film, the novel was already a much-loved part of my mental furniture.  I felt that Gregory Peck's Atticus was right from a cinematic perspective, but wrong in terms of fidelity to the novel.  To me, Atticus was older and more frail, and yet somehow less grave.  On a second viewing, however, I have revised my opinion.  Peck is an outstanding Atticus, and this is borne out by the IMDb trivia section, which usefully explains that Harper Lee was so pleased with the way Peck captured her father's essence that she made a gift to him of Atticus' watch.    It is not putting it too strongly to describe 'Mockingbird' as the first film of the American nouvelle vague.  With their clean, unpretentious images, the opening credits could have been filmed by Truffaut.  This is a style which suffuses the whole film.  Everything is shot with an unfussy clarity and a complete absence of fancy tricks and fancy lenses.  Russell Harlan deserves credit for his intelligent cinematography.    All the novel's major incidents are here.  Scout rides the tyre onto the Radley porch, Jem loses his pants on the fence, Walter souses his vegetables in syrup and the lynch mob is disarmed by Scout's innocent but apposite remarks.  If the Tom Robinson saga seems hurried into the film, as compared with the book, this is entirely understandable - a movie has ninety minutes in which to do the work of three hundred pages.    As Scout the narrator introduces herself, Scout the protagonist swings into camera shot.  This elegant efficiency is characteristic of the whole film.  The energy of the children, and their excitement and confusion on Scout's first day at school, are beautifully in the breakfast scene, with the staccato banging of the screen door.  The Walter Cunningham lunch is terrific, with Peck admirably putting across the deadpan wisdom of Atticus.  Mayella's mendacity, and the wretchedness of her position, are exposed by the very simple but very effective zoom-in during her cross-examination.  As the good ol' boy prosecutor questions Tom, the US flag stands between them, symbolising both the gulf which separates the two cultures and the enlightened work of bridging the chasm being undertaken by the federal government.  This was the era of civil rights agitation, and of the progressive outlook of the Kennedy administration.  It is shocking to the people in the courtroom that Tom should pity Mayella, but for us it confirms his integrity as a man.    Elmer Bernstein's music is, as always, classy, subtle and designed to enhance the meaning of the film.  The opening credits are accompanied by the lone voice of a child, humming.  This was revolutionary for the time, but perfectly-judged, being in keeping with the film's nouvelle vague style, and highly evocative of the child's-eye-view.  The 'creepy' theme for the night raid on the Radley house is brilliant, the piano and clarinet combination producing a memorably haunting effect.    Dill, the little boy whose return signals the advent of lazy summer days as surely as the flowering of the cotton, is an interesting character in his own right.  In real life this youngster was Truman Capote, Harper Lee's childhood friend.  Here he is played by the excellent John Megna.  All three child actors (Mary Badham as Scout and Phillip Alford as Jem) are simply marvellous.  Scout's mixture of self-assurance and childish vulnerability, and Jem's leadership qualities, are captured perfectly.    I accept that I may be wrong in this, but it seems to me that the film hints at a sexual relationship between Atticus and Cal (Estelle Evans), the black woman who runs the Finch menage.  After all, it would make thematic sense.  For all practical purposes Cal is a mother to the children and a wife to Atticus.  Man and woman share a bond of mutual respect which is never voiced because it does not need to be.  At one point, something crops up and Atticus asks Cal to stay the night.  She agrees without hesitation.  Symbolically, this union (enlightened white with decent black) will bear fruit in a future America.  Peck seems to go for a 'Clark Kent' look for Atticus, and my guess is, it's deliberate.  Atticus is Superman, the totally benign, totally capable American hero.  That he can couple with the flower of black womanhood is implicit in, and important to, the film's meaning.    The cramped little 'Huck Finn' courthouse with its imposing facade is wonderful, as is Scout's familiar neighbourhood, with its mature trees and creaking verandahs, flawlessly evoking the Maycomb of the book.    'Boo' Radley is played by the always-admirable Robert Duvall, here making his first feature appearance.

Scout rides the tyre onto the Radley porch, Jem loses his pants on the fence, Walter souses his vegetables in syrup and the lynch mob is disarmed by Scout's innocent but apposite remarks.  If the Tom Robinson saga seems hurried into the film, as compared with the book, this is entirely understandable - a movie has ninety minutes in which to do the work of three hundred pages.    As Scout the narrator introduces herself, Scout the protagonist swings into camera shot.  This elegant efficiency is characteristic of the whole film.  The energy of the children, and their excitement and confusion on Scout's first day at school, are beautifully in the breakfast scene, with the staccato banging of the screen door.  The Walter Cunningham lunch is terrific, with Peck admirably putting across the deadpan wisdom of Atticus.  Mayella's mendacity, and the wretchedness of her position, are exposed by the very simple but very effective zoom-in during her cross-examination.  As the good ol' boy prosecutor questions Tom, the US flag stands between them, symbolising both the gulf which separates the two cultures and the enlightened work of bridging the chasm being undertaken by the federal government.  This was the era of civil rights agitation, and of the progressive outlook of the Kennedy administration.  It is shocking to the people in the courtroom that Tom should pity Mayella, but for us it confirms his integrity as a man.    Elmer Bernstein's music is, as always, classy, subtle and designed to enhance the meaning of the film.  The opening credits are accompanied by the lone voice of a child, humming.  This was revolutionary for the time, but perfectly-judged, being in keeping with the film's nouvelle vague style, and highly evocative of the child's-eye-view.  The 'creepy' theme for the night raid on the Radley house is brilliant, the piano and clarinet combination producing a memorably haunting effect.    Dill, the little boy whose return signals the advent of lazy summer days as surely as the flowering of the cotton, is an interesting character in his own right.  In real life this youngster was Truman Capote, Harper Lee's childhood friend.  Here he is played by the excellent John Megna.  All three child actors (Mary Badham as Scout and Phillip Alford as Jem) are simply marvellous.  Scout's mixture of self-assurance and childish vulnerability, and Jem's leadership qualities, are captured perfectly.    I accept that I may be wrong in this, but it seems to me that the film hints at a sexual relationship between Atticus and Cal (Estelle Evans), the black woman who runs the Finch menage.  After all, it would make thematic sense.  For all practical purposes Cal is a mother to the children and a wife to Atticus.  Man and woman share a bond of mutual respect which is never voiced because it does not need to be.  At one point, something crops up and Atticus asks Cal to stay the night.  She agrees without hesitation.  Symbolically, this union (enlightened white with decent black) will bear fruit in a future America.  Peck seems to go for a 'Clark Kent' look for Atticus, and my guess is, it's deliberate.  Atticus is Superman, the totally benign, totally capable American hero.  That he can couple with the flower of black womanhood is implicit in, and important to, the film's meaning.    The cramped little 'Huck Finn' courthouse with its imposing facade is wonderful, as is Scout's familiar neighbourhood, with its mature trees and creaking verandahs, flawlessly evoking the Maycomb of the book.    'Boo' Radley is played by the always-admirable Robert Duvall, here making his first feature appearance.  Onscreen for a matter of seconds, with no dialogue, he sears onto the viewer's memory the definitive image of Boo, the unlikeliest of guardian angels.

Situations are set up, conflict arises, but none of it really matters because we know that the good guys will always win the big game at the last second. However, although Any Given Sunday becomes fairly predictable toward the end, there's a unique world-weary tone that I've never seen in any other sports movie....ever.          Throughout the first two-thirds of ANY GIVEN SUNDAY, the tone is very downbeat, presenting an expose about the ways that greed and selfishness have wrecked professional football. There are players who are eager to get on the field only because multi-million dollar bonuses are tied to their salaries. There's a quarterback who changes plays in the huddle to make himself look better, and of course, there are conflicts abound between the coach and the owner, realting to business reasons. It seems that football has been ruined ever since TV got involved, judging from ESPN's support of turning a timid player into a jerk, all because of stardom.    OF course, none of these elements are particularly startling all by themselves, but they're delivered well thanks to powerful acting all around. Al Pacino is simply doing what he does best turning up the heat and intensity in front of the camera. Cameron Diaz has a strange role this time around, offering her the chance to really turn nasty at times. Jamie Foxx is superb as Willie Beamen, the third-string quarterback who lets stardom go to his head, and it is a tough role despite how simple it sounds.    Despite the terrific one-on-ones with various actors shining brightly, there is a second dramatic element that is, in a word, overblown. It's impossible not to notice that during the game coverage, Oliver Stone embodies the MTV approach. There are quick cuts, slow-motion shots, fades to black-and-white, shots of a pass spiraling in the air, and about a dozen other tricks. Obviously, some people will eat this up, thinking that more style means better style. Sorry, but I can't agree there. Most of the plays in the game are relatively incomprehensible, and there's rarely a single play that can be understood clearly from beginning to end. Perhaps this is all done to turn up the intensity, but really, although it's eye-pleasing, it's also distracting.     Ultimately, I'm reccomending ANY GIVEN SUNDAY on the strength of its powerful dramatic elements, not the overblown ones. Although the film runs too long by about 20 to 25 minutes and is overambitious, it's nonetheless a smart sports movie that has wonderful ideas and a freshness of presenting all-too-familiar movie cliches.

His first, The Great Gatsby, was probably the best anyone could make of that Great American Novel, thanks to expert casting, period-perfect production values, and a script by a truly great scenarist, Francis Ford Coppola. His second attempt, Something Wicked This Way Comes, was in trouble before he even called action! Ray Bradbury, adopting his own novel, should have backed out of the project and bought back the rights as soon as Clayton said SWTWC wasn't cinematic enough and that the screen play would have to differ from the book. Clayton must have been looking at Cliff Notes or the inside of a bottle (or both) because few books are as visually stimulating from scene to scene (no, from word to word) as is Bradbury's. The witch in the balloon is just one vivid memory which would have been visually stunning. But Bradbury succumbed and while the movie is mildly interesting, it's so far afield of what it could have been that this bafflement is grave indeed. Mr. Dark (Pryce does his best) doesn't have the necessary fear of good as he does in the novel (note the Bible tearing scene), which gives his evil an omnipotence that lacks for drama when it needs it most. The second major fault of the film is the tossing of Georges Delerue's music. This is usually a bad sign that the film makers, upon glaring at the mess of a rough cut, lack faith in their own product and hope music will save their film (in this case, NEW MUSIC!).  SWTWC is no exception and if they'd only hired someone of Delerue's talent (or realized that music wasn't the problem and kept his), they would have at least had a good score.
