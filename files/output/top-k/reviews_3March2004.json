This leads to that and that leads to something else and that leads to this and so on. What is special about this film, is that everything is connected. This is not Tarantino nonsense, that has no point and simply tries to rely on gimmicks and witty dialog. This is a clever thriller. The story centers around Corky, Violet and Caesar, who in one way or another, are involved in a plan to scam the mob. Of course, scamming the mob is never a good idea. Issues of trust, loyalty, love, violence and everything else are covered. There are very arousing sex scenes and scenes of disturbing violence, utilizing pruning shears. All of it choreographed beautifully by two very talented brothers. However,it is Joe Pantoliano who steals the show. He plays a wiseguy that gets caught in a downward spiral that can only finish one way, but he does his best to delay it. How he was omitted by the Academy is beyond me. To the pompous nitwits that peck away at this film, I have one question. What Hollywood films in the last ten years can you reel off that were nearly as clever as this film? Yeah, I thought so. **** out of ****, a simply brilliant motion picture.

Comedies, Dramas, Suspenses, Horror films, even documentaries. This was such a film written at the best archetypal pace and yet, has validity and stands on it's own as a Superman film. Supergirl was one of the best ideas to hit the big screen. The Superman formula had been worn very thin by the egregious Superman III, and the world needed a new style and direction of the series. Alas, this film was conceived, with the best special effects crew and a cast that could take home the Oscars like Lord of the Rings Return of the King in a limousine on a gravel driveway. But the film was not well received, because many believed it to be a bad film and criticized it with out even seeing it. The film, a Superhero's story, is about Kara-El, Superman's cousin, who must go to earth and save mankind from a witch who is going to take over the world, to save millions and most importantly, to do what's right. Very major events take place and important life lessons are learned.The film is not only a great film of Superhero wonder and mystique, it is a completely written archetypal story with wit, charm, and heart to it. The story begins in the inner space where a city has been built to store all the citizens that survived the Krypton explosion. This is where not only the movie, but the archetype begins. With the biblical dressed people of ArgoCity, and the people whom inhabit the story. then, the magical symbol for eternity is introduced as an omegahedron. It is lost by a young Kara, who is introduced as the soon to be Supergirl. This is where our both heroin and initiate is introduced. She loses the omegahedron and must go to earth to retrieve it. From here we are taken on the famous dual journey The Journey of physical sanctity, but also the journey of self discovery. When Kara goes to earth and becomes Supergirl-Woman of steel, she is naive to all the ways of earth, and is new to all the ways of technology. This is buttressed by her bracelet she carries with her to help her track the omegahedron, which brings us to our next archetype. Selena is a power hungry witch who wants no more than to rule the world. This is not just your average villain, but with needs and clauses to be treated like a person, but knows not how to obtain these things. This gives Selena great depth to add to her fueling anger towards mankind for not getting her what she wants. There are characters all over the place symbolizing the archetype of the accomplice or friend who helps the heroin through the beautiful but difficult journey. Then you have the mentor of the story, zaltar, the founder of Argocity and the one who is paying for Kara's mistake by sending himself to the phantom zone. This is a powerful moment of truth and justice when he and Kara are in the archetypal moment in the movie where the heroin and the mentor are faced with death and crossroads and must come through new people-all done greatly and masterly in the frighteningly tense phantom zone scene which Kara displays great courage in the face of death. Finally the archetypal battle of the villain and hero ends with the villain in white and getting a comeuppance of great justice to the hero. Then the hero returns home knowing that she is a new person and has learned both lessons of life and lessons about herself. And in the perfect archetypal ending, she enters the inner space zone through water-symbolizing the cleansing of her soul and mind. So one sees, Supergirl has much to be praised about being a Superhero film with terrific acting and a great cast, but a script that seems to be dumped on the most. Everyone attacks the script but does anyone really think about it? IT is a very intelligently written script about finding out what you can do and looking inside yourself to see the beauty within. All attackers of the writing if this greatly done archetype masterpiece will one day have their comeuppance like the villain Selena does. And one day this film will, I believe, receive the best treatment for which is so rightly deserves. Helen Slater, Faye Dunaway, Peter O Toole, Jeannot Szwarc, Jerry Goldsmith, and Ilya Salkind all did their absolute best to make sure that this film is a thrilling experience, and I think they have done their job. Plus all the rest of the cast and crew which did their time and effort to make this works. It does.

But you know what? I'm not here to really promote this movie, or analyze it... I'm here to write my love letter for it. We're all here to share our movie-going experiences, aren't we? Well, f*ck it, here's mine.I still remember being a little prepubescent boy sitting in the theater watching this movie, totally amazed and astounded by what I saw. Seeing this wacky cartoons going through a routine Tom-and-Jerry-type episode... and then... it was amazing how these movie actually tricked you, convinced you to believe that human and cartoons can exist in the same universe and dimension of reality. There are many a great pleasures and moments in this movie, one of them is the duet at a toon night club called The Ink & Paint Club where Eddie goes to get information about Roger's wife, and the opening act is a dueling duet on the piano featuring two great legends, Daffy Duck and Donald Duck (I doubt there's any biological relation there) together at last. Why did it take so long for these two to get together? Well, they are rival entertainers for rival studios, so... But of course, the dueling duet ends in an all-out war. Come on, we both know the hatchet wasn't going to stay buried very long.The whole movie is worth renting just to see the two great legends, Daffy and Donald, put their differences aside for one memorable dueling piano duet ALONE. Roger Rabbit pioneered not only animation and film-making style, but acting, writing, directing and a meshing together of different genres. Imagination, luck, brilliance, skill... it's all been blended so perfectly here... just like the animation and live-action.Funny, sharp, satirical, smart, thrilling, skillful, bright, bold, hard-boiled, colorful... at even at times, a little scary.It one three Oscars, not to mention an Honorary Award for it's Technical Advancements. Hell, it deserved every single Oscar it got! And a few it didn't. It should've won every single Oscar that year. Maybe some from others...God, you know, I still remember finding my little Rescue Ranger toy in my pocket and running in back-and-forth through my fingers... I remember being very careful not to loose it as I watched this. And it was hard, damn it, all of what was going up there on the screen.There's the best of the everything here. Everyone should see it, pure and simple. It's a movie... for pretty much everybody. A masterpiece in more ways than one.So help me God, I cannot think of a better actor for the role of the classic, hard-boiled, rock-bottom, not-too-smooth P.I. than Bob Hoskins. I don't think he's ever played a better role in his whole life. He seems to be a strange collision of Sam Spade and W.C. Fields, in some strange way.Christopher Lloyd proves yet again (as he does in all his roles) that he's one of the most underrated actors in the business. He's known for playing the bizarre, the crazy, the wired. But his ability to play villains, particularly more sedate and low-key ones, is overlooked so much, it's grounds for a discrimination lawsuit.Kathleen Turner is damn perfect as Roger's Mrs; especially considering that all she does here is a voice.Roger Rabbit pioneered not only animation and film-making style, but acting, writing, directing and a meshing together of different genres. Literature purists and scholars (yes, I mean geeks) will note that this movie is adapted from a novel by Gary K. Wolf, who specializes in science-fiction. For those of you who are enamored with this movie and just learning this, are actively considering dropping this review right this instant and running to your nearest library and bookstore to pick up a copy to read as an addition to the movie or just out of curiosity, I should warn you that the movie is completely unfaithful to the novel. Oh, both are clever and well-written spoofs of the whole hard-boiled private-detective mystery noir genre, but the two are so completely different, in writing-style, character dialouge, plot, theme, even ending, you wonder why they even bothered to get Wolf's permission and pay him a royalty. Gee, usually these Hollywood types are a little more snaky and know how to exploit all these loopholes.You've no doubt heard the old saying, You can't please everyone, so don't even bother. Because when you try, you wind up ultimately pleasing no one. Least of all, yourself. It's strange, this movie seems like an exception to that one little rule. I mean, I know there's an exception to every rule, but this is one you're sure is completely iron-clad. This is a movie for everyone. This is a movie that will please everyone. And you know what else? It never got the credit for that. Think about what a big train-wreck this movie could have been. How many things could have gone wrong. How many years Disney and Warner have been at war, all this time, money for a experiment that could have gone worse than than the killer bees and the atomic bomb. And yet, glory be, it didn't.

But his ability to play villains, particularly more sedate and low-key ones, is overlooked so much, it's grounds for a discrimination lawsuit.Kathleen Turner is damn perfect as Roger's Mrs; especially considering that all she does here is a voice.Roger Rabbit pioneered not only animation and film-making style, but acting, writing, directing and a meshing together of different genres. Literature purists and scholars (yes, I mean geeks) will note that this movie is adapted from a novel by Gary K. Wolf, who specializes in science-fiction. For those of you who are enamored with this movie and just learning this, are actively considering dropping this review right this instant and running to your nearest library and bookstore to pick up a copy to read as an addition to the movie or just out of curiosity, I should warn you that the movie is completely unfaithful to the novel. Oh, both are clever and well-written spoofs of the whole hard-boiled private-detective mystery noir genre, but the two are so completely different, in writing-style, character dialouge, plot, theme, even ending, you wonder why they even bothered to get Wolf's permission and pay him a royalty. Gee, usually these Hollywood types are a little more snaky and know how to exploit all these loopholes.You've no doubt heard the old saying, You can't please everyone, so don't even bother. Because when you try, you wind up ultimately pleasing no one. Least of all, yourself. It's strange, this movie seems like an exception to that one little rule. I mean, I know there's an exception to every rule, but this is one you're sure is completely iron-clad. This is a movie for everyone. This is a movie that will please everyone. And you know what else? It never got the credit for that. Think about what a big train-wreck this movie could have been. How many things could have gone wrong. How many years Disney and Warner have been at war, all this time, money for a experiment that could have gone worse than than the killer bees and the atomic bomb. And yet, glory be, it didn't. We all live for days like this, filmmakers, film critics... and film lovers. The best part? After it was all over... Roger and Baby Herman went on to star in several of their own cartoon shorts before the movie for real (Dick Tracy and Honey, I Shrunk The Kids). Good for them.--In Honor of Roger And His Pals, Dane Youssef ","genre":"Animation, Comedy, Crime"},{"date":"3 March 2004","score":"2 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":"  This is by far and away one of my favorite movies.  Aside from all of that top 100 ranking nonsense this is one of the richest, genuine forms of film. The casting is simply perfect.  Hill's direction along with the impact of a witty, thoughtful script make this a movie admirable throughout the ages. The poker scene on the train with the exchanges between Lonnegan and Gondorff is worth seeing by itself.  The soundtrack makes the movie as well, and one of my favorite parts is at the end when Redford and Newman exchange glances and head out after the con is played while the entertainer starts up slowly in the background.  In a way i think its unfair that Redford hasnt been more decorated by the academy or his peers.  I think because of the fact that he is so picky with his roles that critics to tend to over analyze him.  With that said I still think Redford should have one his best actor award that he was nominated for that year.  Redford absolutely nailed the Hooker character and his ability to convincingly play both sides between Lonnegan and Gondorff certainly had me fooled the first time i saw the movie.  But there is no question that Redford's character was made better by Paul Newman.  The two playing off each other is classic and i think Paul Newman was grossly overlooked for his role as Gondorff.  Unfortunatly Newman is so talented that i think we tend to take for granted his greatness. Robert Shaw as Doyle could argued as the best character in the movie.  His mannerisms and style make you want to see him get conned.  But its the subtle things about the character that Shaw hits perfectly.  Such as the way that if you look at his face during the poker scene you see the growing distaste for Gondorff.  Or the fact that he only smiles twice in the movie (when he boasts 4 nines and when he tells of putting the 1\/2 million on lucky dan) both times he gets conned!  The rest of the cast rounds out well, my personal favorite being Kid Twist.  His scenes with Redford while they string Lonnegan along are believeable even though Doyle is skeptical of the operation.

SUPERMAN THE MOVIE director, Richard Donner, was fired from SUPERMAN 2 after shooting something like 75% of the film. The producers hired Richard Lester and shot many new scenes that were to be combined with some of the scenes Donner directed. The end result is that the film looks like a terrible patchwork of many things and SUPERMAN 2 just feels like a HUGE sloppy production.As an aficionado of movie mistakes and continuity errors, the only thing I can say about SUPERMAN 2 is that it's a feast for my eyes. It's really fascinating to watch. In the Richard Donner scenes, Margot Kidder looks healthy and beautiful. In the Lester scenes, Margot looks positively gaunt and anorexic. The effect of seeing Margot change from unhealthy to healthy and back to unhealthy throughout the movie is jarring. Then there's the slight alterations that were made to the villains costumes from the Donner shots and the new Lester shots. Notice Ursa's costume is more revealing in the Donner scenes than in the Lester directed ones. Also, Terence Stamp looks much thinner in the Lester shots. And the villains also have less white makeup in the Lester directed shots.But even if the jarring effect of watching the Donner and Lester scenes coexist together is enough to make one's head spin, the individually directed scenes of SUPERMAN 2, mainly the Lester ones, can only be described as all round sloppy. For instance, the whole Paris scene. In Metropolis, Perry White tells Clark that Lois Lane is in Paris covering the story of terrorists with a hydrogen bomb, but the scene after that one we see Lois in Paris, talking to the police officer and she's told by the police officer that there's a hydrogen bomb in the Eiffel Tower and Lois acts surprised, like she was just told about it for the first time. I'm sure the scene with Lois in Paris was supposed to appear first and then followed by Perry telling Clark about Lois in Paris. But as it is in the film, the order of the scenes doesn't make any sense.When Superman and Non chase each other over the water, we actually see the wake of the boat filming the footage of the river and cityscape. This shot shouldn't have made it in the final cut. Why did Lester leave it in? It's really bad. There there's the whole battle at the end, which is played strictly for camp. People losing their wigs. Ice cream flying into people's faces. Phone booths falling with people inside. A-ha...not. Note to Richard Lester this is not a Beatles movie.For a film that cost $50 million, everything about SUPERMAN 2 feels cheap.Cheap production values, like the moon set or the NY city street set, the village set, etc. The village set is probably the least convincing movie set ever built for a major movie. Cheap use of stock footage, from the first SUPERMAN movie, such as when Clark and Lois return from the north pole and the car driving through the Rockies is actually the car that's flipped over in SUPERMAN THE MOVIE. Or the use of fly over footage taken from the first movie which was used for the rockets is now used for the villains when they fly towards the village.Cheap special effects, like the dreadful animation when the phantom zone thingy goes through shockwave from the nuclear blast. Zod walking on water and you can clearly see the plank underneath the surface of the water. The helicopter being tossed around by Ursa's kiss. The use of little dolls for Superman or the villains flying all over NY city scape. There are some good FX here and there (my favorite is when Non goes through the buildings) but most of the special effects are *really* bad, even for that time.Sloppy writing. The inconsistent use of superpowers. In SUPERMAN THE MOVIE, Superman could fly super fast and affect time itself. But in SUPERMAN 2, it takes Superman forever to arrive in Paris. The villains (and Superman) have bizarre powers like levitating objects with their eyes or by just pointing their fingers. When Ursa is bitten by the snake, it hurts her. The snake must have fangs made out of steel. Zod easily destroys cars with his laser eyes but it takes him forever to blow up a tanker truck. Non and Ursa throw a bus at Superman, which crushes him like a ton of bricks. But didn't Superman change the direction of the rotation of the earth in SUPERMAN THE MOVIE? What's a bus compared to the gravitational force of a whole planet?Then there's the whole stupid moment in Niagara. Who came up with this stupid script?!?! And some of the dialogue is just painful. And to make things even worse, there are tons of product placement throughout the movie.By reading this, you might think I hate the movie. And to a certain extent, there's something about SUPERMAN 2 I just don't like but I admit that the spirit of the film is goofy. The awe and majesty of SUPERMAN THE MOVIE is replaced by schlocky, stupid fun. Like the producers just didn't care about anything and decided, What the hell. Who cares about all of this. Let's make fun of it all.The one thing I really like in SUPERMAN 2 is URSA. Sarah Douglas is the best thing in the movie. Ursa ROCKS!!!!!!! The highlight of the film is when Ursa flips a manhole cover and throws it mercilessly at Superman. Cool.Anyway, my main problem with SUPERMAN 2, aside from the really stupid script, is that's it's just cheap looking. It's the cheapest looking big budget movie of all time.

They're generally good for a special effects film made in 1978 (even if it feels dated today). The feel of the movie is epic and majestic, thanks mainly to the cinematography and the rousing score by John Williams. What's really poor in SUPERMAN THE MOVIE is the episodic script. 3\/4s into the film, and we're still being introduced to new characters and situations, with no story in sight. Puzo (and other writers) should have written a better, tighter script with a focus on a main story. In SUPERMAN, the film goes like this we see Krypton. Then Krypton explodes. We're then introduced to the Kents. Then dad dies. Young Clark goes to the north pole and becomes superman. We're then introduced to the Daily Planet, and Lois Lane, Perry White, Jimmy Olsen. Then that's it for the newspaper world. We're introduced to Superman as someone who captures crooks, saves airplanes and helicopters and a cat from a tree. The super-heroic stuff is quickly left aside because we're heading into romantic comedy, with Lois interviewing Superman. She even sings about him in her head (?!?!) as they fly together in the sky. Then the romance bit takes a back seat to yet another element, as we are introduced to Lex and company. Then we're introduced to the scene of Larry Hagman and the missiles, etc. The film goes on and on like this. It's very episodic. It's tries to cover a lot in so little time that we never get a whole aspect about anything. Just snippets of Clark as a young man. Clark as a goofy newspaper reporter. Superman catching villains, etc.When the movie finally focuses on a story, it's lame Lex Luthor wants to sink California. In SUPERMAN THE MOVIE, Lex's character is reduced to that of a demented real estate agent with two really goofy sidekicks. And when the earthquake hits California, which results in the death of Lois Lane, Superman turns back time by flying super fast around the earth. Okay.

The evidence is there to behold in this, his breathtaking debut feature length film. Filmed on a micro budget over the course of a year, `Following' is a guerilla filmaking masterpiece. However, the foundations for such a masterpiece were laid even before Nolan took to the camera. The complex, non - linear plot, borne in a well crafted scripted, is truly remarkable. I have come to expect this from Nolan, after seeing his second film, `Memento'. It is not hard to understand why independent film companies and actors Pearce, Pantoliano, and Moss signed up for `Memento' after Nolan made this. He weaves a complex, thoughtful and provocative tale in an accomplished manner that demonstrates perfect timing and a natural masterful control of the medium of film.    `Following' is too deep and has too many twists to describe the plot in much detail. The central character is Bill, a lonely, unemployed, would be writer in his mid &#150; twenties, living in Greater London. Part of his strange lifestyle is his `Following' &#150; whereby he picks a person out from a crowd at random and follows them.  The film starts with a montage showing him doing so, edited with him being interviewed by what we later learn is a police officer, and Bill explains how he has rules that he keeps to, whilst he was shadowing, such as the fact that he will only follow each person once. Obviously, things take a dramatic turn when he breaks this rule, and is confronted by the party concerned, Cobb. Bill tells himself he does this as research for a book he will eventually get around to writing. It is obvious that he has an interest in people, like an outsider looking in, and Cobb seemingly is the same. As Cobb gets him into breaking into houses, and Bill gets to know a woman, events occur in a non &#150; linear way. We see Bill at three different stages in the story, which intrigue us because of a different in hair cut and clothes at times, and the fact that he has obviously been beaten up. Here, Nolan encourages audience to ask questions about what has happened to make these changes and in what order, but he cleverly times the answers so that the format of three different periods in time never becomes redundant or boring. It is always effective, and the three threads come together towards the end in that truly masterful way that Nolan loves to write and direct. I have studied short stories where it is important that not a word, never mind a sentence is wasted &#150; everything is there for a very relevant and direct reason, and this is the case with Nolan's film. Everything you see and hear will be important in some way, though you don't realise it at first. A film like that is truly great. `Following' is.   This being a micro budget film, in black and white, with fairly drab and unsavoury locations, the picture and sound is not brilliant, even on DVD, but it really does not matter, and I actually think it adds to the atmosphere of a film. It feels gritty, it feels like art rather than pure entertainment, it feels like true film making at its rawest, purest form. And in any case the genius of this film does not lie in a blatant visuality, it lies in the plot, the script, the acting and the general narrative, in terms of editing and camera work ,which  tell the story and capture the moment, without being the focus of it.    Like all great films, this bears hallmarks of influence by earlier classics &#150; the idea of a lonely guy, living in a run down apartment, in the middle of a not &#150; to desirable place &#150; who seeks a way to consolidate his loneliness is something that those who have seen `Taxi Driver' will know about. I would bet that Nolan saw `Taxi Driver', and was impressed by it. But, like all great films, whilst there is evidence of influence, this is far outweighed by the originality and freshness of this particular film. `Following' is maybe not as mind &#150; blowingly original as Memento, but it is very fresh, and very interesting, and very much Nolan's film.   `Following' is low key and had a low key release, mainly travelling festival circuits, but thanks to the success of `Memento' and `Insomnia', it has been limitedly re &#150; released on an interesting DVD, and is slowly becoming noticed. So it should be. All those involved in the film deserve some recognition. Jeremy Theobald, also a producer, gives a fascinating and absorbing turn as the central role, Bill.

The evidence is there to behold in this, his breathtaking debut feature length film. Filmed on a micro budget over the course of a year, `Following' is a guerilla filmaking masterpiece. However, the foundations for such a masterpiece were laid even before Nolan took to the camera. The complex, non - linear plot, borne in a well crafted scripted, is truly remarkable. I have come to expect this from Nolan, after seeing his second film, `Memento'. It is not hard to understand why independent film companies and actors Pearce, Pantoliano, and Moss signed up for `Memento' after Nolan made this. He weaves a complex, thoughtful and provocative tale in an accomplished manner that demonstrates perfect timing and a natural masterful control of the medium of film.    `Following' is too deep and has too many twists to describe the plot in much detail. The central character is Bill, a lonely, unemployed, would be writer in his mid &#150; twenties, living in Greater London. Part of his strange lifestyle is his `Following' &#150; whereby he picks a person out from a crowd at random and follows them.  The film starts with a montage showing him doing so, edited with him being interviewed by what we later learn is a police officer, and Bill explains how he has rules that he keeps to, whilst he was shadowing, such as the fact that he will only follow each person once. Obviously, things take a dramatic turn when he breaks this rule, and is confronted by the party concerned, Cobb. Bill tells himself he does this as research for a book he will eventually get around to writing. It is obvious that he has an interest in people, like an outsider looking in, and Cobb seemingly is the same. As Cobb gets him into breaking into houses, and Bill gets to know a woman, events occur in a non &#150; linear way. We see Bill at three different stages in the story, which intrigue us because of a different in hair cut and clothes at times, and the fact that he has obviously been beaten up. Here, Nolan encourages audience to ask questions about what has happened to make these changes and in what order, but he cleverly times the answers so that the format of three different periods in time never becomes redundant or boring. It is always effective, and the three threads come together towards the end in that truly masterful way that Nolan loves to write and direct. I have studied short stories where it is important that not a word, never mind a sentence is wasted &#150; everything is there for a very relevant and direct reason, and this is the case with Nolan's film. Everything you see and hear will be important in some way, though you don't realise it at first. A film like that is truly great. `Following' is.   This being a micro budget film, in black and white, with fairly drab and unsavoury locations, the picture and sound is not brilliant, even on DVD, but it really does not matter, and I actually think it adds to the atmosphere of a film. It feels gritty, it feels like art rather than pure entertainment, it feels like true film making at its rawest, purest form. And in any case the genius of this film does not lie in a blatant visuality, it lies in the plot, the script, the acting and the general narrative, in terms of editing and camera work ,which  tell the story and capture the moment, without being the focus of it.    Like all great films, this bears hallmarks of influence by earlier classics &#150; the idea of a lonely guy, living in a run down apartment, in the middle of a not &#150; to desirable place &#150; who seeks a way to consolidate his loneliness is something that those who have seen `Taxi Driver' will know about. I would bet that Nolan saw `Taxi Driver', and was impressed by it. But, like all great films, whilst there is evidence of influence, this is far outweighed by the originality and freshness of this particular film. `Following' is maybe not as mind &#150; blowingly original as Memento, but it is very fresh, and very interesting, and very much Nolan's film.   `Following' is low key and had a low key release, mainly travelling festival circuits, but thanks to the success of `Memento' and `Insomnia', it has been limitedly re &#150; released on an interesting DVD, and is slowly becoming noticed. So it should be. All those involved in the film deserve some recognition. Jeremy Theobald, also a producer, gives a fascinating and absorbing turn as the central role, Bill.

She knows one song (a Maoist propaganda song) and that not very well. She hasn't a clue about how to manage a classroom. Her arithmetic is suspect and her people skills are those of a self-centered beginner. It's not even clear that she wants to do the job. In fact she seems more concerned about the 50 yuan she's supposed to get than anything else.Thus acclaimed Chinese film maker Zhang Yimou sets the stage for a most compelling fairy tale which illustrates how the determined spirit of a little girl might triumph over poverty, ignorance, and the hard-headed reality of the post-Maoist bureaucratic society.And is she determined! She is given 30 pieces of chalk and warned not to waste any of it. The lesson plans are to copy some lessons on the chalkboard and to get the students to copy the copy. That's it! Both the regular teacher and the town's mayor point to the other as the one who will pay her. When the regular teacher starts to leave without paying her, she chases after him. She is told she will get paid when he returns, and if all the students are still enrolled, she will get a ten-yuan bonus.Thus we have the movie's title and the source of Teacher Wei's determination. When one little girl is picked to go to a sports camp because she can run, Wei hides her from the authorities. When Zhang Huike, the class trouble-maker (played by Zhang Huike), quits school and heads for the city to find work, Wei schemes ways to get him and bring him back.At this point the magic begins. With this common goal both teacher and the kids figure out ways to raise money to send Wei by bus to the city and back.They figure the cost for Wei's round trip and for Zhang Huike's one-way trip back, with the kids themselves taking the initiative at the chalkboard with the math. Wei makes them empty their pocketbooks, and when there is not enough she takes them on a field trip to a brick-making factory and together they move bricks to raise the cash. Again they calculate how many bricks they must move at so many cents per brick.I mention all this because what is demonstrated, by the by, is some real teaching and learning taking place. In fact the mayor comes by and peeks into the classroom and is delighted to see that the substitute teacher knows how to teach math!This sequence of events is very moving and is at the heart of the film. Any teacher anywhere in the world will recognize how brilliantly this is done. The kids become so eager to learn that they learn effortlessly, which is the way it is supposed to be. Furthermore, one of the phenomena of the profession is exemplified that of the real teacher learning more (partly because she is older) than the students from the lessons they encounter.Now, it is true that director Zhang Yimou does not show us the real poverty that exists in China nor does he point to the horrid dangers encountered by children who go to the city to work. Neither the little boy nor Teacher Wei is preyed upon in the manner we might fear. Recapitulations of the baser instincts of human beings are not part of Zhang Yimou's purpose here. This is in fact a movie that can be viewed by children, who will, I suspect, identify very strongly with the story. Zhang Yimou is talking to the child in all of us and he does it without preaching or through any didactic manipulation of adult verses child values. It is true he does manipulate our hearts to some degree, but with all the ugliness that one sees in the world today, perhaps he can be allowed this indulgence.Although I would not say that this film is as good as Zhang Yimou's internationally celebrated films such as Red Sorghum (1987) (his first film) or Raise the Red Lantern (1991) (which I think is his best film) or The Story of Qiu Ju (1991) (which this film resembles to some extent), it is nonetheless a fine work of art exemplifying Zhang Yimou's beautiful and graceful style and his deep love for his characters and their struggles. And as always his work rises above and exists in a place outside of political propaganda as does the work of all great artists.Perhaps more than anything else, however, one should see this movie to delight in the unselfconscious, natural, and utterly convincing amateur performance by Wei Minzhi as a most determined and brave little girl. She will win your heart.(Note Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote! Get it at Amazon!)

She will win your heart.(Note Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote! Get it at Amazon!) ","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"3 March 2004","score":"32 out of 37 people found the following review useful","review":" Wei Minzhi (played by Wei Minzhi, essentially playing herself) is a 13-year-old peasant girl pressed into being Teacher Wei at a small rural elementary school when the regular teacher must take a month off. She knows one song (a Maoist propaganda song) and that not very well. She hasn't a clue about how to manage a classroom. Her arithmetic is suspect and her people skills are those of a self-centered beginner. It's not even clear that she wants to do the job. In fact she seems more concerned about the 50 yuan she's supposed to get than anything else.Thus acclaimed Chinese film maker Zhang Yimou sets the stage for a most compelling fairy tale which illustrates how the determined spirit of a little girl might triumph over poverty, ignorance, and the hard-headed reality of the post-Maoist bureaucratic society.And is she determined! She is given 30 pieces of chalk and warned not to waste any of it. The lesson plans are to copy some lessons on the chalkboard and to get the students to copy the copy. That's it! Both the regular teacher and the town's mayor point to the other as the one who will pay her. When the regular teacher starts to leave without paying her, she chases after him. She is told she will get paid when he returns, and if all the students are still enrolled, she will get a ten-yuan bonus.Thus we have the movie's title and the source of Teacher Wei's determination. When one little girl is picked to go to a sports camp because she can run, Wei hides her from the authorities. When Zhang Huike, the class trouble-maker (played by Zhang Huike), quits school and heads for the city to find work, Wei schemes ways to get him and bring him back.At this point the magic begins. With this common goal both teacher and the kids figure out ways to raise money to send Wei by bus to the city and back.They figure the cost for Wei's round trip and for Zhang Huike's one-way trip back, with the kids themselves taking the initiative at the chalkboard with the math. Wei makes them empty their pocketbooks, and when there is not enough she takes them on a field trip to a brick-making factory and together they move bricks to raise the cash. Again they calculate how many bricks they must move at so many cents per brick.I mention all this because what is demonstrated, by the by, is some real teaching and learning taking place. In fact the mayor comes by and peeks into the classroom and is delighted to see that the substitute teacher knows how to teach math!This sequence of events is very moving and is at the heart of the film. Any teacher anywhere in the world will recognize how brilliantly this is done. The kids become so eager to learn that they learn effortlessly, which is the way it is supposed to be. Furthermore, one of the phenomena of the profession is exemplified that of the real teacher learning more (partly because she is older) than the students from the lessons they encounter.Now, it is true that director Zhang Yimou does not show us the real poverty that exists in China nor does he point to the horrid dangers encountered by children who go to the city to work. Neither the little boy nor Teacher Wei is preyed upon in the manner we might fear. Recapitulations of the baser instincts of human beings are not part of Zhang Yimou's purpose here. This is in fact a movie that can be viewed by children, who will, I suspect, identify very strongly with the story. Zhang Yimou is talking to the child in all of us and he does it without preaching or through any didactic manipulation of adult verses child values. It is true he does manipulate our hearts to some degree, but with all the ugliness that one sees in the world today, perhaps he can be allowed this indulgence.Although I would not say that this film is as good as Zhang Yimou's internationally celebrated films such as Red Sorghum (1987) (his first film) or Raise the Red Lantern (1991) (which I think is his best film) or The Story of Qiu Ju (1991) (which this film resembles to some extent), it is nonetheless a fine work of art exemplifying Zhang Yimou's beautiful and graceful style and his deep love for his characters and their struggles.

He gets there and finds out quickly that it isn't going to be easy--he goes through one degrading experience after another.  At the end of his rope he hooks up with crippled, sleazy Ratso Rizzo (Dustin Hoffman).  Together they try to survive and get out of the city and move to Florida.  But will they make it?Very dark, disturbing yet fascinating movie.  Director John Schelsinger paints a very grimy portrait of NYC and its inhabitants.  In that way it's dated--the city may have been this bad in 1969 but it's cleaned up considerably by now.  He also uses every camera trick in the book--color turning to black & white; trippy dream sequences; flash forwards; flash backs (especially involving a rape); shock cuts; weird sound effects...you name it.  It keeps you disoriented and off center--but I couldn't stop watching.There isn't much of a story--it basically centers on the friendship between Rizzo and Buck.  There is an implication that they may have been lovers (the final shot sort of shows that).  It's just a portrait of two damaged characters trying to survive in a cold, cruel, urban jungle.This was originally rated X in 1969--the only reason being that the MPAA didn't think that parents would want their children to see this.  Nevertheless, it was a big hit with high schoolers (back then X meant no one under 17).  It also has been the only X rated film ever to win an Academy Award as Best Picture.  Hoffman and Voight were up for acting awards as was (mysteriously) Sylvia Miles who was in the picture for a total of (maybe) 5 minutes!  It was eventually lowered to an R (with no cuts) when it was reissued in 1980.Also the excellent song Everybody's Talkin' was introduced in this film--and became a big hit.A great film---but very dark.  I'm giving it a 10.  DON'T see it on commercial TV--it's cut to ribbons and incomprehensible.
