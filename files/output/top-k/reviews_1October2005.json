In contrast in TPM we have the unspeaking, storyless Darth Maul and no explanation of the opposition of the Sith and the Jedi. And anyone who found Darth Sidious exciting has to be pretty stupid. That side of things gets minimal time in the film, and it's just a case of Oh right so that's the Emperor then. It's like Lucas made all three prequels without managing to really cover any of the interesting stuff.Lucas destroys the mysticism of the Force with some pointless midiclorian idea, and then conversely can't be satisfied with Vader being a human who turned bad and makes him in to some kind of counter-Christ virgin birth figure. I have no problem with Anakin being a child, and the podrace thing has a certain logic to it, as well as the scene of him leaving his mother, but from there on it's impossible for the central character to exhibit any character or realistically participate in any action. It would have been far more sensible if there were at least some negative aspects of the future Vader's childhood life, or if he had some residual Jedi abilities (or if he was a bit older).An earlier reviewer suggested that Lucas is being castigated for trying new ideas instead of remaking the originals. On the contrary. He chose to use old elements, such as CP30 and R2D2 and the planet tatooine, when this would only give the films a feeling of gimmicky fakeness. Anyone with a brain would find it odd that 3PO forgot that he had been made on Tatooine or met Obi Wan, or that Obi Wan would completely forget the droids I don't seem to remember ever owning a droid. Then Lucas creates new elements such as Amidala and Jar Jar, who are just poor analogues of characters from the originals. The gunguns were basically the ewoks (natives!) in even more annoying form, and Amidala just an insipid and wooden version of Leia! (Jar Jar = Chewbacca).The most amazing thing of all was that Lucas actually denied us what we came to see amazing battle scenes. The final space battle scene was rushed and undramatic. The one on Naboo was choreographed, cartoony and unrealistic. The blaster shoot out in the palace was perfunctory and pedestrian. At no point was there EVER a sense that the good guys might not win. And to cap it all, Lucas goes against the entire spirit of the originals by making the good guys win by pure chance, not through any striving or ability! ANH thrived on the fact that the audience was rooting for the underdog against all odds. TPM was basically the opposite of everything a straight forward blockbuster should be, whilst completely lacking the depth of character, acting, plot or action sequences that it would need to be anything more.Lucas focused on the Darth Vader story, which we all wanted to see, but did not develop it at all, so that we were left totally unsatisfied at the end. As a result the rest of the film was just a pointless, meaningless background with no adversity at all.This is probably the worst film ever made.

She is there to help identify a large tooth found inside the corpse of a diver who was chewed in half while underwater. When it is revealed to be that of a very large crocodile, she teams up with numerous game wardens, a wild life officer (BILL PULLMAN) the town sheriff (BRENDAN GLEASON) & members of his department & an eccentric thrill seeking mythological professor\/millionaire (OLIVER PLATT) who dreams of swimming with crocodiles, mainly because crocodiles were highly worshipped in many nations in centuries past. While together, they decide to camp out by the lake in an effort to draw out the beast & hopefully trap it. However when they come fact to face with the carnivorous creature, they discover that the traps they have laid out in order to capture the beast may be to small, as it turns out they are dealing with a monstrous 30 foot predator with an appetite for carnage to match!LAKE PLACID is everything a really good monster movie should be, exciting, gory, funny, sharp & witty, with good acting, direction, special effects & snappy dialogue, plus it has a good plot, fun characters & even gets a bit schlocky at times (but in a good way). To be truthful though, despite it's (then A- list) cast & huge theatrical treatment, LAKE PLACID is basically a glorified B movie (at least in terms of it's plot) but for the most part the film is very well handled, especially when it comes to the direction, as Steve Miner manages to keep the film moving at a quick pace & captures the gorgeous lakeside & wooded scenery very well on camera (it's utterly breathtaking & so beautiful to look at!) the suspense is very well handled, with one moment in particular towards the climax should bring the most strongest of wills onto the edge of the their seat! another thing I liked was the twist ending, which reveals that there was not just one crocodile eating people, but rather two! & unlike most creature features, the beast is never killed at the climax, instead it's shipped away to a zoo. It's definitely a change from the norm, that I will give them, it's just to bad the same thing couldn't be said for the other croc, who winds up having his head blown off! (in a scene that pays tribute to JAWS). The acting is really good here, especially Beatty White as an eccentric elderly housewife, who winds up feeding most of her live stock to the beast. The rest of the characters are pretty funny as they all have a pretty good biting wit about them. But it's Oliver Platt who steals almost every scene he's in, as the eccentric millionaire. The monster attack sequences are not only quick, but brutal & gory & many times come in moments you would least expect them too. The creature effects (a mix of both practical & CGI) are very well done & realistic looking (the practical effects were done by the late Stan Winston, a friend of director Miner). Plus the creature is taken very seriously here.On the downside however, the film never really amounts to much, at least not where most creature features are concerned, as the film really doesn't do anything too new with the material (at least nothing that we haven't seen before) minus adding the quirky characters & humour (the latter of which does get a little juvenile at times) & the climax is somewhat disappointing, especially considering the momentum the film had going in when building towards it's climax & I wasn't to thrilled with the romantic angle between Bill Pullman's character & Bridget Fonda, it just felt out of place for the movie & cheapened it somewhat, thankfully Miner doesn't seem too interested in it either & downplays it through most of the film. The script by The Practice\/Ally McBeal writer David E.

She is there to help identify a large tooth found inside the corpse of a diver who was chewed in half while underwater. When it is revealed to be that of a very large crocodile, she teams up with numerous game wardens, a wild life officer (BILL PULLMAN) the town sheriff (BRENDAN GLEASON) & members of his department & an eccentric thrill seeking mythological professor\/millionaire (OLIVER PLATT) who dreams of swimming with crocodiles, mainly because crocodiles were highly worshipped in many nations in centuries past. While together, they decide to camp out by the lake in an effort to draw out the beast & hopefully trap it. However when they come fact to face with the carnivorous creature, they discover that the traps they have laid out in order to capture the beast may be to small, as it turns out they are dealing with a monstrous 30 foot predator with an appetite for carnage to match!LAKE PLACID is everything a really good monster movie should be, exciting, gory, funny, sharp & witty, with good acting, direction, special effects & snappy dialogue, plus it has a good plot, fun characters & even gets a bit schlocky at times (but in a good way). To be truthful though, despite it's (then A- list) cast & huge theatrical treatment, LAKE PLACID is basically a glorified B movie (at least in terms of it's plot) but for the most part the film is very well handled, especially when it comes to the direction, as Steve Miner manages to keep the film moving at a quick pace & captures the gorgeous lakeside & wooded scenery very well on camera (it's utterly breathtaking & so beautiful to look at!) the suspense is very well handled, with one moment in particular towards the climax should bring the most strongest of wills onto the edge of the their seat! another thing I liked was the twist ending, which reveals that there was not just one crocodile eating people, but rather two! & unlike most creature features, the beast is never killed at the climax, instead it's shipped away to a zoo. It's definitely a change from the norm, that I will give them, it's just to bad the same thing couldn't be said for the other croc, who winds up having his head blown off! (in a scene that pays tribute to JAWS). The acting is really good here, especially Beatty White as an eccentric elderly housewife, who winds up feeding most of her live stock to the beast.

As a thriller it is good. The tension in the movie is at times really notable and has a very realistic feeling. Also as a character study this movie works. Not that often do we get to see the side of- and sympathize for a bank robber in a movie. The character of Sonny Wortzik gets really deepens out in the movie and we get to see him from many different sides in the movie. That he also has an homosexual affair is really daring for the time when this movie was made but director Sidney Lumet doesn't make this a prominent element in the story and is just one of the sides of Sonny Wortzik. I think that is a really good approach towards the character which works really well for the movie. If it was made a big deal in the movie that Sonny had an homosexual affair, it would had only worked distracting from the main story and for the character as well. The fact that everything in the movie is also based on a true story only makes the movie more interesting.The movie sounds heavy but thank goodness it isn't. Dog Day Afternoon is a very fun movie that is filled with some comical situations and dialog, without making this movie look ridicules or entirely comical. It makes Dog Day Afternoon a light movie to watch, even though it still has some heavy moments in it of course. Therefor this is a movie that should be appealing and watchable for everyone.The movie is filled with a very realistic atmosphere- and camera-work by Victor J. Kemper. The movie has a gritty depressing like atmosphere which makes the movie its story work really well.There is no holding back Pacino! He puts lots of effort and passion in his character. It truly is one of his most memorable roles. I especially like the scene's between him and actor Charles Durning who plays Det. Sgt.

Small details, like - The president of the U.S. being emotional and taking a personal vendetta? - Isn't it naive to pretend to win a war against drugs with a commando force and taking down some drug lords? - Hollywood's ability to investigate and simulate real locations is frankly embarrassing. The have an ability to make fool of themselves for erratic representations and show their big ignorance with the way they show life in underdeveloped places. Bogota is characterized as a dusty, hot and poor city. Bogota is not dusty, not ugly and is cold. I've never seen places even close to the ones showed in the movie. They shoot in places in Mexico, but guys Not everything below the great river looks like Mexico. Not every Colombian is a drug dealer, as I guess not every American is a junkie or an ignorant, neither stupid. But if we take what Hollywood shows looks that way. They might shoot the Bogota scenes in Mexico City, it is a lot more similar to the real Bogota. -You can see soldiers everywhere you go to. They show Bogota as a place where you can get killed by a sniper in any minute. Far away from the real thing, taking off the credibility of the movie, and also creating a false and erratic image of a whole country. - This lack of investigation from people involved in the representation of tropical countries is not new, and not over. The fockers is even more embarrassing, show a even bigger ignorance of how a country really is. For a production costing several millions of dollars, they might take the hassle to investigate a little more (at least investigate) and not to make fool of themselves. -A high rank CIA officer going to the jungle to rescue some soldiers and fist-figthing drug lords? Come on!And for the record paramilitaries, guerrillas and Colombian soldiers use nice uniforms, in some way very similar to the U.S. soldier's ones. After all, those uniforms are made here too.. ;). And drug lords don't use bodyguards with cheap formal suits. They dress casual and classy too. Military Police uniforms were accurate, at least something good. Like it was said in the first part of the movie as long as there are consumers, the will be someone providing you drugs, no matter where they come from. That's why I liked the movie, it is a realistic story. Not very well represented (at least the Colombian part), but I've seen worst.

Forget the content or the message, for now, let's just look at the picture.First, using a sepia tone for all the Mexican scenes. This was great, giving a perfect emotional tone to the moral and physical poverty that is Mexico. It was also an easy but clever way to let us know when we passed from one side of the border to the other.The shot of the helicopter landing in Mexico City &#150; what a great shot!!! That right there is a tour-de-force of the imagination. To make something mundane like a helicopter landing and turn it into something artistic is a small triumph, and this picture is full of such small triumphs.Shooting the picture in a semi-documentary style at times lent a powerful immediacy to many scenes.Note something you won't note while watching the film the score. Why won't you note it? Because it is almost non-existent. Since silent pictures movie makers have used the power of music to emotionally manipulate audiences. We have heard these emotional musical cues so often we now respond to them automatically like Pavlov's dogs.But in this picture the score is almost non-existent, yet the picture is still powerfully gripping. This let's you know just how great the acting, directing, editing, casting, scripting, is. Everything that needs to go right in a film went right in this one.Now, to the message content. Many say this picture is not preachy. I must disagree. The message is nihilism. That the whole war on drugs is pointless, so why fight it? The only smart thing to do is to sell drugs, after all, the drug dealers are winning anyway. That's the message.I must disagree.

I accepted them as they were. The one character I did want to slap the crap out of was (Michael Douglas' on screen daughter) Caroline Wakefield's boyfriend, Seth. What an amoral, self satisfied, conceited, spoiled little brat. That shows what a good, well drawn character, he is; as was the social worker.

Sure, the special effects looked pretty neat to my young eyes.

But I couldn't make sense of the long, philosophical chit-chat that passes between Maximilian Schell's mad scientist and his unwanted guests aboard the spacecraft Cygnus. Furthermore, the final sequence in which the heroes travel through the titular black hole left me totally bewildered. Having recently re-watched the film as an adult, I found it rather more comprehensible and in some aspects quite interesting, but the thing I just couldn't come to terms with was the fact that a film made with children in mind could allow itself to get bogged down in so much complex talk, and could end with such a metaphysical final sequence.The space shuttle Palomino is travelling through space when its crew unintentionally stumble across along-lost spaceship called the Cygnus. Stranger still is the fact that the Cygnus seems to be parked on the edge of a huge black hole, yet is somehow resisting its tremendous gravitational pull. The Palomino's crew - Captain Dan Holland (Robert Forster), Lt. Charlie Pizer (Joseph Bottoms), Dr. Kate McRae (Yvette Mimieux), Dr. Alex Durant (Anthony Perkins) and Harry Booth (Ernest Borgnine), plus their droid Vincent (voiced by Roddy McDowall) - board the Cygnus to investigate. Dr. McRae in particular is keen to get to the bottom of its mystery, as her father was one of the Cygnus's crew when it was last heard from 20 years previously. Once aboard, they find that the whole spaceship is under the command of Dr. Hans Reinhardt (Maximilian Schell), an eccentric genius who claims that most of his crew left the Cygnus to respond to an order to return to earth. He says that he is the only surviving member of those who chose to remain. Dr. Reinhardt's plan seems to be to take the Cygnus into the black hole and to become the first man ever to learn what lies beyond....There are some dependable names in the cast, and they give enjoyable if undemanding performances on the whole. The special effects are generally quite impressive. John Barry provides a really memorable score which sounds similar to some of his work for the James Bond films. Where The Black Hole comes undone is in its very time-consuming and complicated talky scenes - in particular, a heck of a lot of time seems to be taken with Schell imparting his philosophies to his unexpected guests. Also, the final sequence reveals that black holes are gateways to heaven and hell. While this is an intriguing idea, it is very deep and metaphysical for kids to get to grips with.... and the sequence is rather clumsily put together anyway, so that it seems more muddled than clever.

Looking back, it ruins the continuity, but luckily as a little kid I didn't care. I even enjoyed the widely panned sequel, yeah it wasn't as good as the original, but it is still funnier than much of what Hollywood releases today. Not to mention the numerous memorabilia such as bed sheets, lunch box, and action figures.The movie also introduced me to the comic geniuses that are Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, and Harold Ramis. Keep in mind that Saturday Night Live, Caddyshack and previous movies they were in were before my time or were in movies that my parents wouldn't let me see at the time. Murray plays Dr. Peter Venkman, the reluctant leader of the group who would rather pick up some hot chick than further his science career. Aykroyd is Dr. Raymond Stantz, the naive one of the group who enjoys his work a little too much. And Ramis, the perennial straight man, plays Dr. Egon Spengler. All of them hit each joke perfectly.In addition to the main cast, the supporters are just as perfect. First is the scene stealer, Rick Moranis as an accountant turned Keymaster. Sigourney Weaver, who did look good back then but the frizzy hair hasn't aged well, is Venkman's love interest turned Gatekeeper. Then there are Annie Potts as the token New Yorker secretary and Ernie Hudson, the only ghostbuster without a Dr. in his name that keeps the group grounded and keeps thing in perspective from a regular guy's point of view.The movie itself maybe not be as quote worthy as other 80's classics and some of the CG has not stood the test of time (where George Lucas when you need him) but the movie as a whole is still worth watching especially with Halloween coming up. So fire up the DVD and let the Ray Parker Jr. blare (which I don't think sounds anything like Huey Lewis' I Want a New Drug). And don't forget to roast some Staypuft Marshmallows over the fire.

Looking back, it ruins the continuity, but luckily as a little kid I didn't care. I even enjoyed the widely panned sequel, yeah it wasn't as good as the original, but it is still funnier than much of what Hollywood releases today. Not to mention the numerous memorabilia such as bed sheets, lunch box, and action figures.The movie also introduced me to the comic geniuses that are Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, and Harold Ramis. Keep in mind that Saturday Night Live, Caddyshack and previous movies they were in were before my time or were in movies that my parents wouldn't let me see at the time. Murray plays Dr. Peter Venkman, the reluctant leader of the group who would rather pick up some hot chick than further his science career. Aykroyd is Dr. Raymond Stantz, the naive one of the group who enjoys his work a little too much. And Ramis, the perennial straight man, plays Dr. Egon Spengler. All of them hit each joke perfectly.In addition to the main cast, the supporters are just as perfect. First is the scene stealer, Rick Moranis as an accountant turned Keymaster. Sigourney Weaver, who did look good back then but the frizzy hair hasn't aged well, is Venkman's love interest turned Gatekeeper.
