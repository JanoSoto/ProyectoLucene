[{"date":"26 April 2008","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Kenneth Branagh's Love's Labour's Lost does exactly what it was intended to do Turn Shakespeare's play into a thirties American Musical. The result is just that. No more, no less. It is as bad as any of those miserable American musical from the late thirties-late fifties. The fact that it's Shakespeare does not arrange anything Branagh is only really interested in the thirties aspect. Like any of those musicals, it is corny, completely artificial, has no depth. But it also funny, charming, and mostly entertaining. There are occasional times where you will laugh like a madman (one must admit that it's much better than As You Like It) Branagh's scream as the King of Navarre pushes the ramp Branagh is on, every second with Timothy Spall, who is hilarious (Boy, what sign is it when a worthy man grows mel-an-choly- Hilarious, and the whole I Get A Kick Out Of You musical number), Miss Marple's monologue and version of The Way You Look Tonight , and other things. Overall, this film is nothing more- nor less- than an American Musical, worth seeing just to see how well Branagh pulled off the idea of making Shakespeare's play be exactly like a musical.
