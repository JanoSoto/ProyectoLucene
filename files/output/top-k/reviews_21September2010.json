[{"date":"21 September 2010","score":"","review":" Shrek is a 2001 computer animated comedy that tells the story about a grumpy ogre (MIKE MYERS)who lives in a swamp. He befriends an annoying ass named Donkey(the hilarious EDDIE MURPHY). As his place is under attack by some fairytale creatures like Snow White,The 3 little pigs and the bad wolf,Cinderella etc Shrek goes to Dulock to see the King Farquad who sents Shrek and Donkey off on an adventure to rescue a princess named Fiona(CAMERON DIAZ) who is actually an ogre. As Shrek saved Fiona from the guarded dragon and on the highest room in the tallest tower he begins to see a different side to her and you can tell what's going to happen. Every time I watch this movie I think of it as the male version of Enchanted as they both take the mickey out of other fairy tales like Snow White,Sleeping Beauty & Cinderella and they both contain hilarious sidekicks Donkey in Shrek and Edward & Pip in Enchanted. I loved Shrek since I first saw it back in 2001 and my favourite charcther would be Donkey or Fiona, Shrek comes in after that. I'll give it a 9\/10.
