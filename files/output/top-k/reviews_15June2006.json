Extremely gripping and almost has educational value I would not object to schools showing this to kids in the mid-teens.But I have three complaints (the last two cost it one star).First, Ed Norton being overlooked for the Oscar for his performance in this film simply goes to show you what a wank the Oscars really is. I'm sure that Roberto Benigni's performance in life is beautiful would have been terrific, but I'm prepared to hand the Oscar to Norton without even seeing Life is Beautiful for one simple reason transformation. Acting a character who's personality and eccentricities are constant (eg.. Forrest Gump) is not nearly as difficult as playing a character who starts out as one type of person and transforms gradually to another throughout the film. Norton performs this to a tee and is, to date, the most under-rated actor to grace Hollywood - (did anyone else see his top-notch performance in the People vs Larry Flynt?) Second, there is an unnecessary addition to the story. At the end of the film, Norton walks his brother, Danny, to school and they stop off at a diner. Then the school principle and another guy rolls in and tells Norton that some of his old neo-Nazis mates were beaten up last night and he needs to re-infiltrate the group. Norton was protesting saying that his old friends are probably looking to do him in. I didn't really understand how this fitted into the story. What exactly were they trying to achieve with this extra piece of story that seemed somewhat out of place or superfluous to the film? All I can think is that they were re-iterating the fact that Norton won't so easily walk away from his old life, but this still seems unnecessary to me.Third, I think the film was just a bit too peachy pie in some respects. From the moment that he starts folding sheets in jail with the likable and funny black guy, you know that somehow these two are going to strike up a friendship and this will play a pivotol roll in helping Norton to see the light and turn his life around. But the problem is that everything just happened too perfectly. First, he is raped by his neo-nazi friends for dissin' them and playing basketball with black guys. Just didn't seem to be credible in a way, but then again, i've never been in prison and shared a cell with Ben Dover and Bob Downe. Nonetheless, the fact that the neo-nazi's raped him instead of another group of inmates makes his ultimate rejection of neo-nazi ideology all the more.... perfect. I'm not a neo-nazi advocate by the way. But what about this after he diss's the neo-Nazis, they no longer protect him and in turn, he is beaten and raped by some random guy. See that is credible! But the writers desperately wanted him to be raped by his own so that his rejection of them and his transition to being a good and accepting person is peachy pie perfect.I also found that the shooting of Danny at the end of the film was partly an attempt to ensure that the film doesn't have too much of a peachy pie perfect ending. As a result, I felt like there was something too deliberate about it and come to think of it, I think that the scene in the diner with Norton (as I mentioned above) was probably a distraction, so that we were more surprised by the fact that Danny was shot only a few minutes later. Even if I'm wrong, it seemed a bit too contrived and cost it a star.Otherwise, brilliant film ","genre":null},{"date":"15 June 2006","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" This film is a gem and a rather intelligent and poignant story.

By plain I don't mean boring or uninspiring. I call it plain art because even to consider this genius work in the same category as other movies is risking comparison, and placing this movie beside another movie is almost unfair, because no movie has ever come close to being as unique.2001 A Space Odyssey is by far the most original piece of cinema ever created. It not only represents an idea so creepy and so realistic, but also breaks barriers in movie storytelling. Everything, from a 3-part narrative to an ending that makes you think for hours, wows the audience and sends their heads flying back in shock. It's a movie that a few may find weird, disjointed and pretentious, but every good movie is criticized by the public.The movie tells the story of a major transition between apes, humans and technology. Apes evolve into humans, and humans give birth to artificial intelligence. Probably one of the most memorable scenes in cinema history, as an ape smashes bones and throws one up into the air, director Stanley Kubrick carefully crafts a flawless transition from a bone into a space ship. Kubrick then takes us through some creepy ideas about unexplainable events and technology taking over humanity. Though we see three different stories, they are all connected the apes show the first sign of evolution into humanity as they become more aware of their surroundings and learn the nature of mystery. Then, fast-forwarding thousands of years later, we see the story of a spaceship traveling to the moon on a commercial craft, and as they arrive they are shocked to find a monolith, which then transitions into a couple of months later when a newer spaceship is traveling to Jupiter.Kubrick really shows his genius in this movie, as he both directs the movie and the special effects. For the year it was made, 2001 A Space Odyssey completely shocked the audience with one of the most advanced and complex effects ever seen, which wows viewers even to this day. In an age where special effects were all done by hand, 2001 A Space Odyssey makes many people skeptical as to how they achieved some of the scenes without computer help. Aside from the stellar special effects, the score is the most haunting and unique piece of music ever put on the big screen. It so closely fits in with the movie with some major key scenes.The movie plays like an opera. It sways the audience in an inspiring music frenzy while also focusing on a story. And as we watch this movie brought to life, we question our own faith and our own motives in terms of creating artificial intelligence and traveling to foreign planets. What if one day our own race creates a HAL 9000 (a supercomputer with the ability to think and feel)? Questions like this are very much discussed upon watching this terribly amazing movie.Stanley Kubrick's best direction and one of my top movies of all time. It makes any other movie about space travel or artificial intelligence look shameful.

However, what Hitchcock presented in this film is much more than just one of the biggest suspense movies of all time, it's a true representation of our own desire to look into the private lives of others. It's a story about a realistic approach to voyeurism and the outcomes that follow. At first, leading man Jimmy Stewart denies his own boredom by sitting by his apartment window observing his neighbors, but soon realizes it may have been for the best.L.B Jefferies (Stewart) is a professional photographer who broke his leg and is strapped to his chair with minimal capability to enjoy any activities. With nothing to do, he spies on his neighbors who he knows nothing about. He becomes more skeptical of his neighborhood as one of them becomes delusional and depressed, attempting to take her own life. Also, higher up in the building, a businessman suspiciously gets rid of his invalid wife, leaving Jefferies to believe he had killed her. Gene Kelley plays Stewart's eccentric girlfriend who at first thinks Jefferies has gone too far by spying on his neighbors, but soon plays a big part in his game when she too suspects a murder in the building across.Hitchcock cleverly orchestrates a vision so realistic and powerful that we dare not ever look in the wrong direction again. The entire film is set in one location Jefferie's apartment. Every shot of the neighbors, buildings, and strangers is shown from Jefferie's point of view, making it all the more claustrophobic and realistic. We know almost nothing about the neighbors, and very little about Jefferies (for example, how he broke his leg), which only adds to the urge to know more about others and the irony that we know it's wrong yet we can't help but to look away.The directing is superb and we can almost instantly see Hitchcock's influence on huge directors such as PT Anderson and Quentin Tarantino with his endless tracking shots and flawless choreography of one seemingly endless scene. Hitchcock also chooses a perfect set-design, helping to create a very open yet confined space. The score may not be as good as other Hitchcock films but it fits the mood quite well. We hear both internal and external music, which Hitchcock intelligently connected in order for us to feel the mood he is conveying and to understand the realism of the movie.Rear Window has to be one of Hitchcock's best movies. More than just a clever suspense story, we are exposed to an entire social conflict that resembles our own lives. Our own flawed behavior gets hidden behind closed doors but as we see this film we start to understand the complexity of the characters and how they relate to us.I'll give this movie a 9\/10 because of my very minor problem with the score and that I just can't help but compare it to the flawless work of Hitchcock's Psycho and Vertigo.

I missed a few parts so I really wanted to see it again. I looked through all my movies and there it was! Someone had recorded it a long time ago. I watched it again and wow! Patrick Swayze is so sexy in this movie! I wish I was Baby so I could dance with him! Oh, and I looked up Patrick Swayze's age. I can't believe he's 54. That's unreal. I want him to be the same age he was in Dirty Dancing and always look that great! He's really hot!Anyway, I watched it 2 more times in 24 hours. I'm obsessed but what can I say, I love it!

Not in recent memory -- the lot of them are average looking, handsome women that are better with words than with their looks, and anyway, they're not in it for the sexiness inasmuch as for getting paid for typing tens of thousands of words compiled in paper and Times New Roman print.Paul Verhoeven is a boy with a lot of dreams. Looking into his movie BASIC INSTINCT, itself a remake of an earlier movie he directed DE VIERDE MAN which told the similar story where a blonde woman stalked and insinuated herself into a man's life with dubious intentions, you would think he was trying to splash his fantasies on the big screen.He succeeds. Here the blond is not Renee Soutendijk but Sharon Stone, and Stone looks, talks, and acts quite a bit like Kim Novak at the time she made VERTIGO. Stone is by far the best thing in the movie and would it that she'd been born twenty years earlier Hitchcock would have had a field day with her. She's the ideal cool blonde for the Nineties, the woman that is sensual but can be cruel and detached and men just love her the more for it. She's a fantasy waiting to explode unto men's pants, and she is fully aware of her power. I don't think that there's ever been such an actress, and it's too bad she hasn't been allowed to shine in memorable roles there's an old Hollywood about her, something that says she's above it all, inaccessible, glamorous even when unkempt, the stuff that makes female icons. In Catherine Tramell, whether she liked it or not, she found her best role to date, and even though she would go on to CASINO, her work there is uneven but devours her male co-stars anyway.As Catherine Tramell Stone throws herself into the role and makes it her own. She has one of the most memorable movie entrances as a dispassionate woman who could care less what the authorities thought of her -- that if you don't count the first scene, which evolves from an abstract mess to a ferociously coupling man and woman whose blond hair covers her face. She later takes full control of an interrogation scene, and from then on, the movie is basically hers and no one else's. Michael Douglas has little to do other than act angry, bewildered, be in danger, lose control, and show that he had to work his a** off -- literally -- to compete with Stone's rock-solid body. Stone, on the other hand, had that voice, that thing around her swirling like moths to a flame, that just ignited the screen around her. It's never really a mystery as to the whodunit, but Verhoeven is fulfilling a fantasy of his own and letting the audience in on his dirty little secret. All he wants to do is to tease, bring in two more young babes, and let the sparks fly.And fly they did. A good yarn despite the plot holes, sudden hairpin turns of the story, and its ultimate resolution, BASIC INSTINCT is erotic in a raw, aggressive way that sets it light years from the more cerebral works of eroticism. It's great fun, because nothing can spawn more enchantment than seeing a battle of the sexes with the odds in favor of the woman, and in this case, a woman who is in power, in full command of her body, her mind, and willing to go to inhuman extremes to get what she wants.

However, Curtis Hanson, a director who after this would move on to one more suspense movie, THE RIVER WILD, before cementing his status in Hollywood as a powerhouse director capable of telling acute stories in any genre, had in his hands an okay story. What he did with it, is something else.Two women are unknowingly at the heart of a tragedy when one of them, Claire, gets touched inappropriately by her gynecologist and suffers an asthma attack. She sues, he commits suicide, and his wife suffers a miscarriage. But she's decided not to let matters heal by themselves. No. Peyton Flanders has more up her sleeve than anyone will imagine. She's going to make Claire's life a living hell. And take over her life, her husband, and her little baby.So off she goes to the Bartel household in Perfect Suburbia, and manages to get herself hired as their nanny. Of course, she's so absolutely sweet; she basically is a walking ad for Stepford niceness. Anyone would have a go at her as a nanny, or anything else. Andrea Yates, move aside. Peyton is in the house.What Claire and Michael (Matt McCoy) don't know is that little by little, Peyton is taking over the house. (It's always like this the targets never know they're in danger until the water is up to their neck and rising quite rapidly.) And it's little things. The baby seems to be happier with Peyton than with Claire, but that's okay, apparently she has a good hand with babies. Then again, the nursery has been changed and looks surprisingly like another nursery. Of course, anyone who has seen through Peyton's charm might be well advised not to walk into the family greenhouse. Or leave aspirators unattended. Marlene (Julianne Moore, then unknown), a family friend, warns Michael on Peyton, but it leads to more confusion.Rebecca De Mornay never had a role as good as this one and never has had one since. With Peyton she could have even garnered an Oscar nod, but maybe it wasn't her time. All she could hope for is that audiences see her controlled features, always ready for a smile, hiding an insane rage that explodes in one spellbinding sequence as she destroys a bathroom -- such is the intensity of the hatred her character feels towards Claire who only reported an incident, not knowing it would lead to this.Annabella Sciorra has an equally difficult role to do because her character is the victim. There's an elegance in the way she reads her lines -- she comes across as very poised -- and her way of playing into the rising disquiet within Claire is pretty keen. It's the first of a short cycle of roles she would play where she would be the victim; here, however, she is first-rate, the camera loves showing her from different angles as if observing her go from calm to progressively worked up to all-out insane.Curtis Hanson has made an excellent, sharp thriller that rises well above the trashy material that it originates from. It's easy to forget the coincidence involving the two women, and as I've stated before, it would have been best not to explain or show the real meaning behind a person's rage, but have it exist, making that person even creepier. Even so, Hanson constructs his movie carefully, never allowing for any Boo! moments to come through until the moment when events lead to graphic violence make way for a couple of them, even then controlled.

In this early effort, Alfred Hitchcock shows why he would one day become arguably the greatest director ever. You want mystery &#150; The 39 Steps has got it. You want comedy &#150; The 39 Steps has got it. You want intrigue &#150; The 39 Steps has got it. You want a little romance &#150; The 39 Steps has got it. It's all here and wonderfully done. And the best part, it's aged rather well. The actors speak in a natural tone and rhythm and it doesn't have that stagey feeling that so many early mystery\/thrillers seem to have.And talk about influential. I doubt it was the first, but The 39 Steps sets out the blueprint of the wrongly accused man on the run trying to find the truth that has been copied countless numbers of times. The number of films that have followed this formula is staggering. Even Hitchcock himself would revisit this formula over and over again. Why mess with a winner? The only negative thing I can say about The 39 Steps and the only reason I don't rate it a 10\/10 is my problem with the lead actor, Robert Donat.

In this early effort, Alfred Hitchcock shows why he would one day become arguably the greatest director ever. You want mystery &#150; The 39 Steps has got it. You want comedy &#150; The 39 Steps has got it. You want intrigue &#150; The 39 Steps has got it. You want a little romance &#150; The 39 Steps has got it. It's all here and wonderfully done. And the best part, it's aged rather well. The actors speak in a natural tone and rhythm and it doesn't have that stagey feeling that so many early mystery\/thrillers seem to have.And talk about influential. I doubt it was the first, but The 39 Steps sets out the blueprint of the wrongly accused man on the run trying to find the truth that has been copied countless numbers of times. The number of films that have followed this formula is staggering. Even Hitchcock himself would revisit this formula over and over again. Why mess with a winner? The only negative thing I can say about The 39 Steps and the only reason I don't rate it a 10\/10 is my problem with the lead actor, Robert Donat. It's not that he's particularly bad, but he's just not a very likable guy.

I was skeptical at first -- Hamlet in 2000? But Michael Almereyda pulls this off. In many ways it is more accessible than traditional Hamlets. The film has its staccato-like moments, which adds to the tension, and much of it is filmy and dream-like. Add superb acting and directing (you believe Hamlet's father was killed by his sleazy corporate brother, Ophelia's confusion, Hamlet's wonder at the situation) and you have a winner. I especially love the way Bill Murray does Polonius's speech to Laertes and Ethan Hawke's get thee to a nunnery speech to Orphelia. I would suggest high school students watch this version for another view of the masterpiece-- Hamlet. Highly recommended.

The movie points out how one name can bring down an entire empire. It's been said that there are 2 things you cant kill 1. an idea and 2. one's Name. Throughout the movie Maximus shows so much integrity it's overwhelming towards the end of the movie. It makes you heart grow as you see how people that barely know you are ready to die for you because you stand for a symbol not because you did them a favor or saved their life.It's a man's movie in my own opinion because it punctuates some valors that women don't need. Valour, Honor, strength, loyalty.If you have the chance to see it more than once pay attention to the faces of key actors during key moments and you will actually re-discover the movie.
