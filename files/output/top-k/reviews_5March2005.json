You really have to have an appreciation for Stanley Kubrick to appreciate this film.The movie is supposed to be set in NYC,, but one of its biggest flaws was , it was apparent it was filmed in another city (London to be exact). Tom Cruise plays a physician, Bill Hartford.

It's almost like this movie sends a subtle message- don't cheat or even think of cheating or they will get you! This is all proved by a series of strange coincidences throughout the film, including the prostitute that Dr. Hartford attempts to hook up with. Sydney Pollack has a role in this film as a friend of Bill Hartford, seemingly normal, but then he too is involved in orgy-like escapades that involves people wearing masks,, another part of the film I thought was creepy.The music played during the orgy scenes, believe it or not, is hauntingly beautiful. There is a lot of speculation as to whether Dr. Hartford is dreaming the entire time the film takes place. I honestly do not know and this never occurred to me the many times I've seen this film. Also, I couldn't figure out the purpose of the scene involving the Rainbow Fashions shop owner,, who apparently allows his underage daughter to seduce older men. I guess Mr. Kubrick is just telling us that the world is full of perverted sickos. I think, overall, this is a fine film but you have to be open minded about it.

Such was the case with Primary Colors. Based on the 1996 novel written by Joe Klein that fictionalized the growing pains of Bill Clinton's run for the Democratic presidential nomination four years before, the movie stars John Travolta as Gov. Jack Stanton, a compulsive eater and sleeper-around, and his long-suffering, highly ambitious wife, Susan, played by Emma Thompson.As seen through the eyes of idealistic campaign worker Henry Burton (Adrian Lester), Stanton falls from one boiling pot to another, from taped conversations with a bimbo who is clearly based on Gennifer Flowers to other scandals with less obvious a Clintonesque parallel, especially one involving the underage daughter of Stanton's favorite barbecue chef. For Stanton, winning the nomination is everything, and Burton finds himself struggling to keep his head up over the sludge.While the performances range from pretty good (Lester, Thompson, Kathy Bates as a dustbusting lesbian working damage control on Stanton's character miscues) to fair (Travolta imitating Phil Hartman imitating Clinton, though giving good presence) to flat-out lost in the editing room (Maura Tierney and Billy Bob Thornton, solid as campaign officials until suddenly pulling Houdinis in the final third), the real problem is the script. Eileen May's adaptation struggles to represent every plot twist in the novel's Byzantine storyline, but it fails to capture the wonderfully jaded, wise, and amusing narrative voice of Klein's book, and squeezes in so much the end result is an overcooked soufflé of melodrama.While Primary Colors the novel works as an over-the-top black farce with hints of real pathos, Primary Colors the film gives us a lot of agony and little of the fun. At nearly two-and-a-half hours, this makes for tough sledding.May and director Mike Nichols were the team that did The Birdcage, a fine, outrageous comedy, two years before. Primary Colors would seem a worthy candidate for the same light touch, but except for two sequences, one involving Rob Reiner as the soporific host of the radio show Schmooze For Jews and the other with Tony Shalhoub offering the goods on one of Stanton's opponents, you don't get that here. There's a lot of screaming instead, and talking, and more screaming, and more talking. Staffers blob out on hotel beds and whine about what's going wrong, crises are averted, then something else goes wrong. And everything is played soooo seriously.The movie takes some liberties from the book, not good ones. An outrageously funny Al Sharpton character who rags on Burton for neglecting his black roots is omitted. Tierney's Daisy Green character is locked in a romance with Burton that is central to the novel (will ambition trump love?) but just presented and abandoned, along with Tierney, in the movie. Most important, the novel's ambiguous ending is spelled out with a scene that feels flat and self-congratulatory.The truth is Stanton is hard to place as a good or bad guy, not because he's supposed to be Clinton, but because he's not Clinton. He's his own character, complex, decent, venal, idealistic, funny, greedy, selfish, and worth valuing for all that. Travolta gets the smoothness, but not the underneath part. Nor do Nichols and May, a great comedy team back in the 1960s who seem, for at least this one film, to have misplaced their senses of humor.If I hadn't read the book, I might have liked this more. Maybe I'm docking the film more than I should that way. But given how condensed everything is, I probably wouldn't have understood the movie without reading the book.

See it if you are at all interested in Elmore Leonard or John Frankenheimer, or anyone in the terrific cast, especially John Glover who's admittedly brilliant. But the book--a slow-burning, noir thriller with lots of pulp--should have translated into an Oscar-contending film instead of this dud that couldn't figure out whether it should faithfully portray the hard-boiled, gritty crime story of the book, or opt for a 1980s Schwarzenegger shoot-em-up spree. Shifting the scene from the original locale in the book, Detroit (an area where Leonard has resided for years and knows very well), to Los Angeles makes for a substantial problem that Leonard tries to fix in his script, but ultimately can't. It was, for example, a clever device making Mitchell's wife a City Councilwoman (she had no job in the book), if you think about it that's the only way you could ever plausibly blackmail someone in a sex-crazed city like 1980s Los Angeles for adultery, or any type of potential sex scandal. Even then, it's more plausible in a more conservative Eastern state like Michigan to believe that a) its tiny porno industry is a sleazy, money-grubbing hell where three losers could desperately set up a not-so-stupid upper-middle-class fellow going through a mid-life crisis, and b) adultery alone might be something you could blackmail someone with, if their upstanding careers and old-fashioned wives couldn't handle the shock. As consultant Ron Jeremy will tell you, 1980s Los Angeles was a colorful, stylish porno Mecca, more like the movie Boogie Nights than Leonard's dark, shadowy world of hijacked tourist buses, grimy apartments, and drug deals in depressed urban squalor. Then again, Los Angeles could be the backdrop of such a tale if one arranged the scenery more carefully--there are still plenty of dark crannies and psychopaths there. Unfortunately, Roy Scheider's Harry Mitchell comes off in the film as a sexy, handsome Uebermensch dancing through his problems without even working up a sweat. In the book he was fending off a jerk union official while struggling with a business that was failing. He also had a skeleton in the closet during the war involving friendly fire that he was responsible for, but never appeared to come to grips with. Elmore Leonard's stories usually have a central image involving a bizarre civility between criminal and law-abiding citizen. Here, Harry Mitchell sitting in his office with his blackmailer, Alan Raimy, turning over his financial books to him and negotiating a more practical ransom, makes for such a central image. Glover's blackmailer plays the scene with convincing intelligence, but Scheider portrays the victim here as a cocky good guy, in charge of the situation as if he were more a Rambo with an M-16 than the everyman barely staying afloat as his world crumbles around him. 52 Pick Up ends with one of the worst throwaway conclusions ever, considering all the thought that went into the original story and then the film. Trapping Raimy inside Mitchell's Jaguar and blowing him up with marching band music blasting out along with a sadistic monologue by Mitchell, plays to an audience wanting the sweet revenge conclusion of a Chuck Norris movie, not the intelligent balanced world of Leonard's book, where Mitchell barely escapes in the end and the conflict between good and evil could easily go either way.

Simply because this film quite accurately depicts the life and behaviors of (perhaps ALL) teenagers.I recently read a comment made about this film (a negative one) and i found myself developing the image of an insecure 35 year old who had no fun at high school, irregardless of this, how can someone be watching American Pie for the first time in 2002...American Pie 2 was already released then...Behind the times, yes, perhaps.Overall to come onto IMDb and write a review of what IS a CLASSIC and the STANDARD for any teen movie to this date is just quite funny actually, i have met many types of people with all kinds of personalities and not heard one thing wrong or negative about this film.I do not believe in comparing one teen movie to another because each are their own films, with their own plots\/sub-plots, one liners etc etc.But in order to accurately draw up some sort of conclusion and\/or list of titles in order of the better, then this must be done AND as much as i love the PIE Series of films i have many other favorites that in my opinion don't add up to feel as fresh and funny as the PIE's but FUNNY they very much are.If you watch this movie and feel totally disgusted\/disappointed\/bored\/sick\/revolted\/annoyed even, well think of this, MAYBE it's something to do with YOU and your personality, remember this IS entertainment, NOT REAL LIFE! If it were it would be totally boring.A lot of people (Peeete from UK for one) say the creators were being dishonest etc about the story and it's world far from reality!? What did you do with your friends at school? i agree there is a lack of real behaviors i.e bullying etc but if you take time to hear what the film-makers have to say you will realize you are out of your own depth, Adam Herz clearly states in the making of... that his school-life and friends had an OMAGE feel to it....The point i am making is MY SCHOOL felt like this....Yes some people hate each other BUT it's cast away in the shadows when you bring to light the togetherness feel everyone has.American Pie  Stifler is the (somewhat more verbal less physical) bully.It's all there for your real world eyes to see but when you directly compare this Flick to your actual life then YOU ARE OF COURSE GOING TO BE Disappointed!

Excited about the possibility of showing up their snotty peers who tormented them in high-school, Romy and Michele borrow a fancy car and head for their class reunion. On the way they hatch an elaborate success story....they are going to tell everyone that they invented post-it notes. Sounds easy enough. Nobody really knows who invented post-it notes, right? Wrong. Janeane Garofolo's character eventually shows up in the middle of this conversation and spoils their plan, embarrassing them in front of the A-crowd, which they were trying to impress.

They really make their characters believable, albeit they are only playing dumb blonds. Still, if you like nothing else about 'Romy and Michele's High-School Reunion'(it's only medium-funny), then you'll at least enjoy the subdued work of Kudrow and the cuteness of Sorvino and her accent.

And let's face it, there was enough popular talent involved, including Alison Anders, Alexandre Rockwell, Robert Rodriguez and, last but not least, Quentin Tarantino, for it to have been hailed as an instant cult classic. Instead, it was bashed into submission and retreated very quickly to the back of nearly everyone's resume. With retrospect most of this reproach was probably ill-deserved - 'Four Rooms' does have its blatant moments of weakness, but then again so do a lot of the more half-baked cookie-cutter comedies which have somehow garnered more admiration than this. On the whole it's a very unusual and interesting combination - an offbeat, frisky and strangely feel-good comedy with some sinister undertones and lots of weird, intricate little details. Consisting of four 20-minute segments, each assembled by a different director's hands, it takes us through the various happenings inside separate rooms of the same hotel on New Year's Eve, as experienced by Ted, the only bellhop still left standing for the night shift. There is the slight feeling of inconsistency in moving from one directing style to the next, and a couple of attempts to interconnect the segments are a little self-contradictory. Some of it works and some it doesn't, but the end result is an episodic anthology that, if nothing too spectacular, still proves itself to be very likable in the long run.'The Missing Ingredient' and 'the Wrong Man' are often credited with constituting the weaker half of the film, and I can't really say I disagree. 'The Missing Ingredient' tries hard to be risqué, but falls pretty short - for a story concerning a coven of bare-breasted witches trying to extract an unwilling man's semen for use in a ritual, it's remarkably innocuous and fluffy, and the visual effects only add a layer of tackiness to boot. 'The Wrong Man' is a tad more snappy and sports some stylish direction (the shot where Sigfried grabs the ringing telephone is right-on), but is ultimately swallowed up in its frenzied editing. We can vaguely understand what's happening in this segment (if not, then Ted does drop a pretty big hint later on in the film), but it makes itself unnecessarily incoherent, with bizarre imagery that adds nothing but extra confusion (the baby flashback, anyone?). It's almost as though Alexandre Rockwell isn't sure whether he wants us to be in on the whole set-up with Sigfried and Angela, or confused and in the dark like Ted, and in the end tries to accommodate both perspectives, which doesn't really wash.It's once we reach the second half that the true quality really starts to seep its way in, and the film suddenly becomes very rewarding. 'The Misbehaviours' is a spirited little contribution that combines a moderate dose of macabre darkness with its cartoon-like innocence. Antonio Banderas certainly hits a good spot as the no-nonsense father who appoints Ted to keep an eye on his two young children while he's out, whilst the children themselves are rebellious but not irritating, all making for a surprisingly sharp and sophisticated slice of knockabout. 'The Man from Hollywood', meanwhile, is equally brilliant - Tarantino's vibrant, well-scripted take on Roald Dahl's chilling short story, 'the Man from the South', which pits Ted in the same room as cocky Hollywood director Chester Rush (and it's always a treat to see Quentin himself tackle such a winking, self-depreciating role). It manages to be tense and enjoyable, with the usual smart direction that any Tarantino fan should be able to appreciate. Overall, there's enough vitality in these particular segments to just about redeem the shakiness of the first half.Besides, we have Tim Roth playing our hapless protagonist throughout, and, yes, that is a lot. He proves himself to be very capable in a comic performance, bringing enough gentle magnetism to his character Ted the bellhop, through his good intentions, perseverance and various neurotic mannerisms, to get us genuinely attached to him. It is hard not to come away with the impression that all four directors had a slightly different take on Ted's disposition - he goes from being timid and impressionable to obtuse and jumpy, then highly-strung and a little devious, and finally composed and relatively rational - but Roth does well in single-handedly bridging these gaps and, with the many mishaps his character has to endure over the course of the night, ensures that all changes in temper seem understandable. He retains his good-natured lovability for the entire running time, and, for anyone who can really relate to poor Ted (like yours truly), he'll have you rooting for him to the very satisfying end.To my knowledge, there was never any other film quite like 'Four Rooms' and, judging by just how unwelcome this one was made to feel when it arrived, there probably won't be another for quite some time. It remains an ambitious and not entirely successful little sleeper, but has a good deal going for it nonetheless, and I urge all fans of Tarantino, Rodriguez and Roth in particular not to be put off by the bad press and to give it a chance.

The song, nearly word for word, describes the inner turmoil that the characters of The Graduate face. They are lost and confused, stuck on the bridge of life, two crossing into adulthood, and one into old age. And that's just one way to look at it. The Graduate is one of the best films I have ever had the pleasure to witness, and I only wish I were alive when it was first released. Dustin Hoffman, in his first major film role, plays Benjamin Braddock the epitome of the confused and isolated young adult male. He sits in his room and does nothing. He lies around in his parent's pool for hours on end. Ben, who has just graduated from college, is home for the summer. Then, after an awkward sexual encounter with a friend of his parents named Mrs. Robinson, a one night stand turns into a summer romance. But betrayal soon follows as Benjamin falls for Mrs. Robinson's daughter, Elaine. Nichol's directorial genius (he won an Oscar for the film) really shows in the opening party sequence celebrating Ben's arrival home. There is a close-up of Ben's face as he stumbles his way through the event, listening to advice and shaking hands with the faceless (much like his future) masses. The camera moves in such a way that a feeling of claustrophobia comes over the viewer. They are overcome by what is going on around them, much like Benjamin is at this crossroads in his life. Another example is when Ben first arrives at the fateful hotel where he meets Mrs. Robinson for sex. He walks around the lobby, suspicious that the desk clerk is on to him, and then he attempts to walk into a room. Only a large group of the elderly walks out, and Benjamin stands there holding the door for them. Then he proceeds inside, only to be passed by a group of high school students. This image once again reinforces the crossroads that Ben is at in his life. After finally viewing this classic, I realized that many of my favorite directors to emerge from the 90's (mainly Wes Anderson) were greatly influenced by this film. What's more interesting is that The Graduate was a landmark film for American cinema and the decade in which it was released, sharing the same themes that Benjamin experiences throughout the film. Most of American cinema was very conventional up until the 60's. Nothing extremely scandalous was shown in a film, and many serious topics were not widely addressed through cinema&#133;yet. The Graduate is the perfect mix of old and new. It's the 'bridge' that separates the standard American films from the more experimental ones that would emerge all throughout the 1970's. The same can be said for the decade of the 1960's. America lost its innocence the day Kennedy was assassinated on November 22, 1963. For the next five years, the country went through a spiral of events that led to the sexual revolution of the late 1960's. And The Graduate separates the white picket fences of the 50's and early 60's from the Rock and Roll and drugs of the late 1960's and early 70's. It's a crossroads in the middle of the most turbulent time in American history. In one of the films most ironic images, a tired and lonesome Benjamin slumps on a bench on the Berkley campus (an important place for the sexual revolution) under an American flag blowing in the wind. The flag still waves, but Benjamin is beat. He represents the fall and eventual metamorphosis of the American dream. But aside from all its serious themes and deeper meanings, The Graduate is a comedy at its heart. It contains one of the funniest and most exciting climaxes in cinema. And the final image is a knockout. It shows Benjamin and Elaine sitting at the end of a bus filled with elders, looking ahead blankly, at the road and at their future. Then the bus drives off in the distance. They do not know where their future is headed, or where the bus is even going. It was the same circumstance for America in 1967.

That picture was a Rebecca. However, I am sad to say, this film is not Hitchcock's best. In fact, of the Hitchcock films that I have seen, this is the worst. Oh the irony. But, being as good as Hitchcock is, this does not mean that this is a bad movie.The beginning of Rebecca is atrocious. The acting sucked, the direction was nothing special, and the dialogue took us nowhere. We feel like we are watching some cheesy romantic movie written by a 16 year old girl, and directed by some Hollywood jackass. We begin to wonder Where is the Hitchcock I know? Well know this He is coming. About 30 to 40 minutes through Rebecca, the film begins to excel, and the true Hitchcock comes through. In fact the film becomes so good that it makes up completely for the beginning of the film&#133;almost. The beginning still holds the film back from utter greatness.The script of Rebecca is horrible. It makes the acting seem bad when it really is not, because the lines are so unspeakable. As an actor, I know this is a very bad thing. The story however, is quite genius. Maxim De Winter (Laurence Olivier) had just suffered a tragic loss. His wife Rebecca has just died, and he lives alone. That is until he meets a new woman (Joan Fontaine) who is an assistant to a pompous old fat lady. Maxim and this new girl (her name is never said, we will call her the new girl, at least for now) fall in love, but the new girl must leave to New York, after only knowing Maxim for a week. Hearing this news Maxim asks her to marry him, and come stay at his legendary estate Mandalay. They get married and move to Mandalay, but upon arrival, the new Mrs. De Winter realizes that the servants are still very much attached to the old Mrs. De Winter, Maxim's old wife Rebecca.Hitchcock's style of directing really begins to emerge during the second half of the movie. In the beginning he uses cheesy shots of Laurence Olivier (Maxim De Winter) and Joan Fontaine (The Second Mrs. De Winter) falling in love, and it is almost cringe worthy. Plus Joan Fontaine's acting is horrible. She always bears this expression the is suppose to be love, but looks more like she is looking at a Cow with three legs. But don't worry, she improves. Laurence Olivier is always good, as usual. His style is very male chauvinistic, which is really great. During the film's beginning we also see many very annoying scenes of the soon to be Mrs. De Winter courting Maxim. They are very redundant scenes, and immediately we wish that they would just break up and kill each other. The Film continues in this way for a while, simple, cheesy, and overdone. But then, about 40 minutes through, it changes.When Maxim and the new Mrs. De Winter arrive at Mandalay the film vastly improves. It becomes a thriller, which Hitchcock is so good at. The acting and dialogue improves, and we almost forget the horrible beginning. Joan Fontaine, who was so bad before, becomes great. Her look of fear as she hears more and more about Rebecca is perfect. Also the cast of servants and other characters add a wonderful flair to the film. My theory on why the beginning was so bad? Because Hitchcock makes thrillers, thrillers that are alive, and keep us watching. The script in the beginning was so dull that there was really nothing he could do with it. Plus he did not have a lot of creative control, and that is crucial to a Hitchcock film.Overall a good movie, I would not see it unless you have seen a lot more of Hitchcock films first, because you will get a bad first impression, and as we all know, first impressions are everything.

The first half of the movie, when John discovers he's talking to his long dead father on the ham radio, deals purely with the love between a father and son. Cue many scenes of Frank bonding with both son in present and son in future, full of warmth and feeling that make the viewer think 'Ahh, how nice. This is going to be film filled with plenty of I love you son', I love you too Dad tender moments.' Then suddenly, the film changes direction, from a family drama to an exciting thriller, where John and Frank have to deal with the (inevitable) consequences of their actions.The idea of 'change one thing, change everything' is certainly not a new one. It has been done before in time-travel films like the 'Back To The Future' trilogy and 'Peggy Sue Got Married', and more recently the (far inferior) 'Butterfly Effect'. All the unexpected surprises are there &#150; John accidentally saves his father's life, which should surely be a good thing except that this sets off a chain of events (naturally!) that in this case leads to the murder of seven women, including John's mother; John and Frank try to put right their mistake, and it seems to be working, up until the point where Frank is arrested for one of the murders. But what is good about this film with its not-unfamiliar plot, is that it resists the urge to go in the direction that the viewer anticipates. When it appears that John and Frank's good intentions are not working, and everything they do just seems to be making the situation worse, I was anticipating an unhappy, unresolved ending, one that certainly involved Frank's death. A sort of 'the only way to put the universe right is for Frank to die again, to make up for not dying in the first place' kind of ending, where the lesson is clear don't mess with the past. However, happily for me, 'Frequency' resisted this idea, and ended in such a way that it transformed the whole movie into a feel-good experience.Whilst John and Frank are certainly punished for their actions, incredibly they manage to sort it all out and everybody's happy &#150; although I'm not sure if I agree entirely with the ethics of the subplot involving John turning his friend Gordo into a multi millionaire by giving the 8 year old Gordo the idea for Yahoo! I thought this was rather out of keeping with the rest of the film and the character of John he has learnt the hard way that it is a bad idea to try to change past events, yet here he is consciously altering the destiny of his young friend's life!

Then suddenly, the film changes direction, from a family drama to an exciting thriller, where John and Frank have to deal with the (inevitable) consequences of their actions.The idea of 'change one thing, change everything' is certainly not a new one. It has been done before in time-travel films like the 'Back To The Future' trilogy and 'Peggy Sue Got Married', and more recently the (far inferior) 'Butterfly Effect'. All the unexpected surprises are there &#150; John accidentally saves his father's life, which should surely be a good thing except that this sets off a chain of events (naturally!) that in this case leads to the murder of seven women, including John's mother; John and Frank try to put right their mistake, and it seems to be working, up until the point where Frank is arrested for one of the murders. But what is good about this film with its not-unfamiliar plot, is that it resists the urge to go in the direction that the viewer anticipates. When it appears that John and Frank's good intentions are not working, and everything they do just seems to be making the situation worse, I was anticipating an unhappy, unresolved ending, one that certainly involved Frank's death. A sort of 'the only way to put the universe right is for Frank to die again, to make up for not dying in the first place' kind of ending, where the lesson is clear don't mess with the past. However, happily for me, 'Frequency' resisted this idea, and ended in such a way that it transformed the whole movie into a feel-good experience.Whilst John and Frank are certainly punished for their actions, incredibly they manage to sort it all out and everybody's happy &#150; although I'm not sure if I agree entirely with the ethics of the subplot involving John turning his friend Gordo into a multi millionaire by giving the 8 year old Gordo the idea for Yahoo! I thought this was rather out of keeping with the rest of the film and the character of John he has learnt the hard way that it is a bad idea to try to change past events, yet here he is consciously altering the destiny of his young friend's life! Other than that, I'd give this film 8 out of 10. ","genre":"Crime, Drama, Mystery"}]
