It is a metaphysical story about being, freedom and the human mind, characterized by psycho-sexual associations, studying existence and the vanity of life. By using music, sounds and extreme close-ups in an innovative manner, Teshigahara succeeds to truly touch us. His reflection of an incredibly distressing reality achieves to create an enduring and haunting experience of unforgettable images and cinematic bliss which will not be forgotten.The story begins when an entomologist travels from Tokyo to the sand dunes of Japan to study the life of certain insects. However, his three-day long journey takes a turn when the local community traps him into a domicile at the bottom of a vast sand pit. There, living with a lonely woman, he must try to survive as he goes through an unending and useless battle against the infinite nature.As the film unfolds on the screen, it begins to get even surrealistic features and grows out to be a story about an individual fighting for survival in a hostile environment. Furthermore, it includes an extraordinary sexual tension and an odd emotion of yearn and melancholy within. On one level, it depicts the Japanese mental landscape but could also be seen as a comment on the sudden affluence of Japan in the postwar era. In fact, the film drills down to the social themes of alienation and loneliness quite well while it offers a perverse picture of pathological mankind where the power game between the rulers and the oppressed continues.However, more important than the social aspect is the film's visual aesthetics and its relation with the themes. The vast and endless dunes almost resemble expressionistic art where distorted picture of reality reflects an inner vision. In the middle of Antonionian landscapes, people feel lost and trapped. Teshigara has tapped into this situation perfectly with regards to the poetics of space as the surrounding dunes and quicksand create a prison of mind where there is no way out. Thus, the visuals beautifully indicate the existential experience and agony of man.I think it is fair to say that Teshigara's zen-aesthetics is partly Bressonian -- drama stripped to essentials -- where only the most integral part of the image is shown. The close-ups of wet and dry skin, sand and water are really almost erotic. In fact, the inertia felt in the middle of brutal nature is associated with sexuality, which is another intriguing theme in the film. As the relationship of the man and the woman evolves, the sexual tension tightens and the yearning of touch becomes more vivid and concrete. In this process, the protagonist is stripped down both physically and morally when his conception of humanity is put to test in the chaotic wilderness.

The story of a newspaper tycoons life and how a reporter try's to find the meaning of his last word. Directed and starring Orson Welles.It pains me to say it but I found this film disappointing. I tried to go through my mind after the film searching for why I didn't enjoy it and I considered that maybe it was because of the age of the film, but then I remembered that there were many films from this era that I loved so that didn't stick. The only thing I could say is that maybe it was because it was literally the first big film after the new era of sound and at its time was considered groundbreaking while now it seems tepid. Even this reason doesn't really feel right with me and honestly I think it's down to the following reasons why I truly found this film a let down.The biggest hit to this film for me is the acting, it mentions at the credits that this film gave a first break for some of the actors and it really does show. Firstly though Welles acts his role perfectly as the love starved Kane, perfectly finding his electricity and his need for people to love him. Other than Cotton (perhaps the lead female deserves credit) I found the supporting cast poor in general but this is really to be expected as looking back to most pre 1960 film there are not normally more than two good actors in a film. This does not sound like much of bad point but I coming to why the acting in this film ruins it for me. There is one pivotal scene in the movie, the scene where the child is taken away towards the start. This scene was supposed to show the child's carefree nature and then how this is ripped from him by the corporation coming in and removing him from his family. The scene annoys me, the child actor does not portray the feeling of this emotion correctly and you watch feeling like it could of been done so much better and without this scene being done properly the metaphor for the film is lost. Now you may say this is harsh on the child actor but the people who made this film should have seen this and either re-shot with a different actor or thought of a different idea on how to work the loss felt by the child into the film.My second criticism of the film is partly to do with the way it is filmed, splicing different segments of his life story in different order due to them being told by different people. While I must firstly say this sort of thing in 1941 is groundbreaking and perhaps the fact that they even attempted it shows my following to be a moot point, but I still wouldn't expect this from the Greatest Film Ever Made. Because of this way of film making the scenes with Kane himself are short and sharp, showing change in character very quickly, see scene with his first wife having dinner, this doesn't allow a true character arc. With more time spent in each scene perhaps a feel for the character or an understanding of why he changes could be seen. Also I would of preferred the film to have been perhaps 30 minutes longer to allow for more of Kane's character to be seen with perhaps some delving into his childhood or more of why he no longer ran the paper.I would like to make clear that while I did not completely love this film it must be seen as a groundbreaking film for its time and at the time, the best film ever made. It's use of camera angles and focus is far beyond anything seen in that age with some absolutely amazing cinematography. Two scenes stick out for me, but it must be said that there are many scenes throughout the film which look fantastic. Firstly where Kane is finishing Leland's review of his wife's performance and Leland slowly walks towards him from the distance showing Kane's madness and Leland trepidation of approaching him in one perfect shot. Secondly a scene where Kane signs away his newspaper shows Kane becoming smaller as he walks towards the window and then underneath it. It shows to our perception that the window is bigger than we think and that Kane himself has shrunk in stature.Lastly I would just like to add that after reading the film I read several posts on this films wall wondering why more was not said about Charlie's son. The people on the boards point to it as a flaw in the film while I claim it to be probably it's biggest success. The lack of attention to the child by Kane and the film overall(more so as a metaphor in terms of the film) is down to Kane's own loss of childhood. Being taken from his family and forced to grow too quickly causes Charles Kane to becoming a wreck, a man who will do anything to be loved. He buys possessions and creates a temple, he tries so hard to help the working man by promising to remove corruption and bring truth, he does anything for his wives but in the end does not listen to them thinking only selfishly. All of these thing's he does for love and attention but in the end the loss of his family and childhood leaves a gaping hole in a young Charlie and though he tries to fill this void he cannot, showing the true meaning of this film, and of of rosebud, money cannot buy you happiness. 7\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"2 May 2012","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Citizen Kane has been labelled as one of the greatest movies ever made.

This is not just a diorama kind of 3D conversion; watching the movie it's hard to believe it was not shot in 3D originally. Even in real life action scenes Cameron stems the task of creating realistic 3D perspective throughout the movie. It must have been hell to mesh all the fringes in each and every of the frames. Well, as I learned now, it took 60 weeks and 18 Million dollars to work on this. That gamble payed off very well.Not to mention all the emotion that comes with the story. Cameron is a wizard of timing. One moment the audience is just deeply moved by romance, when it gets torn out right the next moment by fear, anger or laugh.This is a very emotional film.

It's so utterly sweeping to watch this huge vessel rising up in the screen. Cameron outstandingly managed to shoot his sequences comparing sizes against each other which - by their contrast - brings so much emotion to something we only perceive in real life size.After watching the movie, I can't believe this is a 2D to 3D conversion. This is not just a diorama kind of 3D conversion; watching the movie it's hard to believe it was not shot in 3D originally. Even in real life action scenes Cameron stems the task of creating realistic 3D perspective throughout the movie. It must have been hell to mesh all the fringes in each and every of the frames. Well, as I learned now, it took 60 weeks and 18 Million dollars to work on this. That gamble payed off very well.Not to mention all the emotion that comes with the story. Cameron is a wizard of timing. One moment the audience is just deeply moved by romance, when it gets torn out right the next moment by fear, anger or laugh.This is a very emotional film. There are so many different fates one can as easily think his\/her way into. In 1997 I have been crying about what I saw in a movie - I was baffled, because this happened for the first time in my life... Now in 2012 I was crying, laughing, fearing so much all the way again, together with my girl friend.We personally feel so much like Rose and Jack. There are so many details in the movie that match our situation, up to tiny things like dancing barefoot or the butterfly as a symbol for freedom at heart and escape from family's restrictions.To all those who don't like the movie, here's my advice NEVER watch this film on TV! You can only appreciate this precious work of art in a movie theatre. - I never saw this movie on TV and I never will. But when it'll come back to the theatre's in a couple of years, I'll be right back to watch it there.

Indeed, Visconti well and truly transcends his dubious source material to create an innovative film that, to some degree, reflects the darkness, brutality and turmoil of Fascist Italy.Relying on minimal lighting, a small cast and a large amount of location shooting, a sense of realism is conveyed though, at times, this clashes with the melodrama of the sordid narrative. Also, at times, there is a threat that Visconti will veer into film noir territory though, thankfully, he never quite does so.The acting is solid though the character of the husband, a fat capitalist, is more of a caricature than anything else.Unfortunately, pacing problems ultimately undermine the story and any tension that may be building in the narrative dissipates due to the slow tempo.The bleak scenery of poverty-stricken rural towns and dock sides reflects the moral squalor of the characters and perhaps shows how one feeds on the other, with economic downturns leading to a break-up of the social fabric.Nevertheless, the brutally ironic conclusion reinforces the theme of the transience of life and how suddenly violent death can ensure.The music is suitably minimal and the acting is serviceable but ultimately the film lacks any kind of moral centre. Later neo-realism would rectify this shortcoming in the character of the young son in the Bicycle Thieves and the eponymous hero of Umberto D. but here Visconti presents a totally amoral world with only the largely characterless police representing a distant authority that can enforce any order. Perhaps rightly given the political circumstances under which the film was made, they are a remote, almost mechanical presence.Ultimately this is a strong film but one that is almost fatally undermined by its slow pacing. Still, most people will gain something of interest from it provided they do not expect a masterpiece of anywhere near the same calibre as the Bicycle Thieves.

Standing out from the countless B-grade pulp science fiction films produced in the United States throughout the 1950s, its beautiful, subversive message remains as pertinent as ever.A stunning critique of the military and imperialism, it subverts the threat of the alien outsider, making him the truly benevolent one, whilst the earthlings are the dangerous threat, seeking to hunt him down and only too eager to preserve their power through the use of guns.The film truly conforms to theorist Darko Suvin's notion of science fiction being about cognitive estrangement the audience looks at their own humanity through the eyes of Klaatu, the alien outsider, and sees all that is wrong as he sees it. We condemn ourselves.The opening scene establishes this theme by depicting a military base. The first humans to track Klaatu's spaceship are, by their nature, murderous aggressors.Next, in one of the film's most famous scenes, when he lands and emerges, his attempt to offer a gift is met with more brutal violence at the hands of a soldier who guns him down.At the hospital, he sees the futility of trying to deal with a world of political opponents whose rivalry is such that they cannot even agree on a meeting place. As a visitor who has traveled across space to this tiny planet, he sees the futility of their squabbling as do we through his eyes.His escape leads to his chance encounter with a child and it is here, through the innocent eyes of the youth, along with the eccentric, misunderstood scientist, that the only real hope for humanity is found.Besides being an outsider, there are clear Christ parallels in the figure of Klaatu. He adopts the pseudonym Mr Carpenter and is murdered by the military authority only to be resurrected at the film's end before ascending to the heavens. He offers a compassion world-view, far larger than that the earthlings can grasp yet he also sits in judgment of the world and its empires.Ultimately, it is a pessimistic film. Klaatu feels humanity cannot become pacifist of its own accord and thus leaves behind the robot policeman Gort as a threat over the heads of men as a way to force peace and as an indictment of humanity's total depravity.Wise's direction is stunning throughout. The black and white cinematography is excellent. One memorable scene is that of Klaatu\/Carpenter's first appearance at the boarding house, shrouded in ominous shadows, only for his absolute normality and compassion face to emerge as he steps forward into the light. This thereby develops the notion that the outsider should not be instinctively feared.Though the cast is small, Wise conveys the global impact of Klaatu's landing, the feud between politicians and the impact of the power cuts.In one of the few cases of electronic music being used effectively, the film's score remains a classic and evokes a mysterious atmosphere.Michael Rennie is perfectly cast as the compassionate outsider\/Christ figure who is far more humane than the humans he meets.Ultimately, this remains one of the great pacifist films of all time and one of the few great science fiction films to emerge from Hollywood. It is a wonderful, albeit pessimistic tale that condemns the militarisation of the globe and all forms of state-sanctioned violence. Highly recommended.

The actors and the production crew did a great job at portraying each characters emotions and struggles. The plot is also very well written as it draws the audience into its midst and captures everyones attention. One thing that I want to focus on is the character Maximus. Obviously being the main character, Maximus is the star of the movie. He is for one, courageous and strong, never giving up and always fighting for his freedom. He is also a respectful and very humble man. He never shows disrespect to those above him and he never brags about his strength and power. In a quote from the movie he is asked what he is saying to his family who is in the afterlife. He states, To my son - I tell him I will see him again soon. To keep his heels down while riding his horse. To my wife... that is not your business. With a sense of humor he respects his family and remains pure at most. Maximus also never gives up. He understands that he has to keep fighting to stay alive. Anything less and he is a dead man. In explaining this to another character he says, I am required to kill, so I kill. That is enough. Wow. He does it because he has to. If he didn't have to, he probably wouldn't harm a fly. He seems to be the most kind and considerate person, but on the other side of things, understands what is necessary to stay alive. One of my favorite lines from the movie is this, What we do in life echoes in eternity. While not all of us in this world believe in life after death, there is truth and meaning to this for us who do believe. Maximus has has faith in something far more greater then what is here on earth. I love how the movie is constantly showing how Maximus is looking towards the afterlife. When things get tough and there seems to be know way out, this thought of the afterlife, keeps him going. Maximus understands that there is something greater, and he will one day be able to reunite with his family which he loves greatly. I also love the character that Maximus plays because he is constantly keeping one eye on eternity. In the old testament of the Bible, Ecclesiastes 3, verse 11 says that, He has made everything beautiful in its time. He has also set eternity in the human heart; yet no one can fathom what God has done from beginning to end. What a great reminder that this life isn't all that there is. There is more to live for then living a good life, having a good job, and making lots of money. I am not only saying that these things are not important, but they shouldn't control us. What is also very neat in this movie is that the glimpses of the after life are not fully visible. They are not completely clear as to what is happening in these scenes but it is obvious that these scenes of the afterlife are way better then the times during this movie. These glimpses are not completely seen; but we know they seem to be full of life and satisfying. In 2nd Corinthians, the writer says, So we fix our eyes not on what is seen, but on what is unseen, since what is seen is temporary, but what is unseen is eternal. What is unseen is eternal. We don't think like that everyday. But we should.Way to go for this film becoming a top favorite movie for many people. But even cooler, intentionally or not, how it uses its main character to highlight on greater things to come.

What i enjoyed most about this film was the way he attempts to put himself and the audience along with him, inside of his memories. The idea of putting his present self literally in the scene of his memories is one thing, but to have his present self talk directly to the audience when this is happening is something I found really interesting. Not to many people have done this in my opinion and its a unique way to add some comic relief. This film, unlike many of the other films composed in New York City, gave the city life style a more positive look. Many of the city films consist of anger and violence while this one took a more emotional approach.

I won't tell you the in depth story of the film but I will tell you the story before it is actually all revealed, the trailer gives far too much away of the final act which breaks the surprise of the conclusion.The film starts with Kevin Lomax (Reeves) defending a paedophile school teacher who is clearly guilty. Lomax manages to win the case and it is then revealed that he has won every case he has fought in. After winning this latest one, he heads out to celebrate with his wife Mary-Anne (Theron) where he is approached with an offer from a firm in New York who want his help picking a jury. Due to the financial gain, Lomax and his wife take the plunge and move to New York, where Lomax's great work in picking a jury see him lead the line defending a possible triple homicide case and moving into a top end fifth avenue apartment. This is a man at the pinnacle of his career, with a gorgeous wife and now a glorious apartment in one of the most attractive cities in the world. What could possibly go wrong?As Lomax begins to grow into his new job, and work under the supervision of his new boss John Milton (Pacino) things do take a turn for the worse. Mary-Anne begins to feel lonely and craves the baby that could make her life complete, however Kevin's concentration remains on his job. This forces Mary-Anne to socialise with the other lawyer's wives and partners. One day when they are out shopping, Mary-Anne begins to hallucinate and the wives begin to turn into demonic figures. She decides to lock herself in her apartment, where things start to become much worse for her in the hallucination stakes, as well as in the neglect from her preoccupied husband. On the side of his concentration on his job, Kevin begins an infatuation with a co-worker, who he envisions whilst having sex with his wife. His neglect doesn't go unnoticed by Mary-Anne and she slowly begins to free fall into possible schizophrenia, with her ending up in a metal hospital. Has Kevin let his life spiral out of control due to his job, his new boss, or himself?The film is very clever, even if it does become a little supernatural at the end. The courtroom set up works really well, and the fact that the 'demons' belong amongst lawyers seems to be sending out a hidden message. The story here has been developed well and the writing is top drawer. There are many twists and turns in the film, and I'm sure many of you are aware of the outcome, that slowly bring the story to its final conclusion. At several points throughout it is hinted towards what is going on, and the only person that doesn't see it is Kevin. You will find out when you watch it why that is though. Everything pulls together well and it is a real intriguing watch.Al Pacino is fantastic as John Milton, and when you hit the conclusion you will understand how brilliantly he portrays his character. The cinematography also aids in his character with many red lights and dark shadows really highlighting him, as well as Pacino's devilish smile. Theron is also great as the psychologically frail wife. Her emotional ride is clearly visible as the film goes on and she also shines in possibly the most horrific scene in the film, one that forced my jaw to the floor and my hand over my mouth. It was shocking. Keanu Reeves on the other hand plays Keanu Reeves. At times his portrayal works, especially in the final half of the film, however his accent becomes more of an annoyance and his delivery of his line make his performance even more wooden. Another actor may have done the character more justice, but Reeves is known for acting like that. The first half of the film is very slow, and it isn't until about half way through that it really starts to kick in. The hallucinations at times are freaky and it is at this point where you really will become hooked. The story is intriguing and is thoroughly enjoyable considering it is a slight courtroom drama. The twist of the film may not be a surprise, but it does hit you hard and it makes much of the film make more sense. The tension is high throughout the long running time and it had me gripped from start to finish.

That particular doll winds up in the hands of a street pedlar who then sells it cheaply to Karen Barclay, a department store clerk who has been searching for a Good Guy doll as a birthday gift for her son Andy. Andy is excited to get the doll, calling it Chucky. But the doll comes alive & starts exacting his revenge on the people who got him killed. Chucky then attempts to transfer his soul again, this time to Andy. Can Karen & the detective on the case stop him?Film Review Ever since the 1929 effort THE GREAT GABBO, the possessed doll has had a number of appearances in the horror genre. The idea had its best airing in the portmanteau film DEAD OF NIGHT back in 1945, which is still regarded as the final word on the subject. In the 1980s, director Tom Holland, who had made the vampire classic FRIGHT NIGHT, decided to contemporise the story using the visual effects technology of the day.With a story that hangs its plot on the concept of a serial killer transferring his soul into a child's doll & then using the doll's body to commit further crimes, I wasn't expecting Child's Play to be scientifically plausible &#x96; one of the things about the horror genre is the required suspension of disbelief &#x96; but this film really drags the idea through the intellectual gutter that most of the Friday THE 13TH films inhabit (what is quite ironic about Child's Play is that with its wisecracking killer doll, it is similar to A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET which came out only four years earlier).That said, the film works better as a parody, mainly setting its sights on the late 1980s trend of Cabbage Patch Dolls that drove both children & their parents crazy &#x96; the dolls didn't do anything, only they looked quite cute & had their own birth certificates! What better way to scare the public at the time then to exploit their worst ideas about those ridiculous dolls. Quite cynical really.However, with the commentary & all, Child's Play is really quite stupid. Besides the whole soul-transferring-into-doll business, the film throws in some absurd plot devices where Chucky's body slowly turns more human the longer the killer's soul inhabits it, as well as the most obvious idea of forcing Chucky to transfer his soul into the body of the first person he revealed his secret to (in this case, young Andy Barclay). Let's not get into the whole business that is the scene where Chucky confronts his mentor, a voodoo priest, & kills him using a voodoo doll.The shocks are well-staged, particularly the scene where Catherine Hicks discovers Chucky's secret (he's been walking, talking & killing without any batteries!) & the first two kills are suspenseful. But the film loses momentum with its action set-pieces, most notably the part where Chucky tries to kill his police nemesis while he's in his car, which is one of the most unintentionally funny scenes in the whole film. The climax is an amusing scaled-down parody of THE TERMINATOR but ruins itself with the climax going into overtime with Chucky proving to be quite hard to kill &#x96; he's a doll, it shouldn't be that hard to kill him!On the acting front, Catherine Hicks & Chris Sarandon are quite competent, but the film really belongs to Brad Dourif, who makes the role of the killer doll his own, a role he would polish in the sequels.

I took my father to see it on his birthday back in the seventies, because I thought he would get a kick out of seeing someone who, like himself didn't speak much, but when he did, made it count. I think he fell asleep here and there during the film, but then, he was just a man holding down a full time job and taking care of his family.I remember first reading the novel, which I rated as a cultural curiosity somewhere in quality between 'THE DAY OF THE JACKAL' and 'MANDINGO'. The film we enjoyed because of Brando's at that time offbeat performance and the strong ensemble cast. When I went to see 'NOTHING BUT A MAN' with my friend Donald Mack, besides him commenting to me, -this ain't no movie, this is real-, I remember Ivan Dixon telling Gloria Foster in the movie that he was turning out to be just like his father. The manner in which Al Pacino portrays Michael Corleone you see this process of transformation rather than hear the character tell of it. Though in the original screenplay that I was fortunate to read recently, Michael does indeed tell his father, -and now I'm just like you.Francis Ford Coppola has made many interesting statements about this unlikely and serendipitous masterpiece he has wrought. Some of the reviewers have compared it to 'DEATH OF A SALESMAN' complete with a spaghetti dinner, and Coppola himself once compared Don Vito Corelone to King Lear, a man whose void will be hard to fill ere his Kingdom is to be kept from collapsing. Michael, as we come to discover, has the cold Machiavellian cunning, Santino has the muscular viciousness, Fredo the sweetness of a kindly sense of compassion, and Tom as the adopted son the calm deliberation for moderation, and yet not one of these individuals has all these attributes so harmoniously blended into their personality as the Don himself.And who is this Don Vito Coreleone? A man alone with his own thoughts who well realizes he could have been more than he is given an uplifting childhood environment and better circumstances. A natural leader who is even something of a statesman to hear Mario Puzo tell it in his novel, who yet and still played by Brando is a walking shell of a man able to offer his family nothing beyond their material success other than an incremental spiritual decay. Should you doubt this, review the endings of 'THE GODFATHER-II' and 'THE GODFATHER-III again. Now that I look back on it, I don't believe 'THE GODFATHER' would have become the success it is today were someone else to have acted Brando's role. There is an intelligence and a liveliness to all the portrayals from Diane Keaton to Robert Duvall to James Caan and others, but there is something haunting and understated about Brando's performance in this film that speaks to the mystery of unfulfilled human potential. Of all the performances that I revisit in this movie from time to time his is the only one that seems to have grown in stature over time. Sure, I understand better now what a tight spot Michael was in with the death of Santino, and now sitting at his father's funeral, watching Barzini shake hands with his colleagues as though he were the heir apparent, he realizes that he is just the next item to be checked off on the list in a power struggle he inherited more than signed up to fight. That is, unless like Telemachos, he can carry out the plan he and his father designed before Don Vito went off to his grave.I know my girlfriend at the time felt cheated and disappointed with Brando's performance. She wanted more of Stanley Kowalski's animal vitality or the roaring declaiming of Brando as Mark Anthony in 'JULIUS CAESAR'! But I understood, even though I was not at first viscerally affected by it so much, what Brando was doing. The acting that Brando does in 'THE GODFATHER' is the acting of personal presence altitude. The power of his portrayal comes not from what he says or does, but from what he doesn't say or does. It is an understated performance that evokes and causes you to add your own connotations to what he is doing. Here is a self made man who somehow worked himself through material success from something to nothing and is puzzling to himself how he got there, but he is not going to let you see him doing it.I know and have read how Pacino and many others thought he should have been nominated for Best Actor honors along with Marlon Brando and whether he should have or not is more than I know. All I do know is that there were times when the action got hot and furious, and that I was tensely waiting for Don Vito Corelone to appear again, not say or do anything particularly, just appear, and somehow by just appearing stabilize the narrative and bring some kind of sense and order to his surroundings. There are people like that, you know. I remember when I would watch 'Young Abe Lincoln' there was a point in the story where Lincoln played by Henry Fonda would not be physically in the scene, and yet you could feel his shadow over the entire proceedings. Brando's Don Vito Corelone is the moral inversion of all of this. When he lays his plans with his son Michael, you glimpse the roles that Brando could have played; Socrates, Ernest Hemingway, and even Black Elk. The roles of idealism that James Coburn berated him for not playing. And who can say there wasn't time, there just wasn't time?

I took my father to see it on his birthday back in the seventies, because I thought he would get a kick out of seeing someone who, like himself didn't speak much, but when he did, made it count. I think he fell asleep here and there during the film, but then, he was just a man holding down a full time job and taking care of his family.I remember first reading the novel, which I rated as a cultural curiosity somewhere in quality between 'THE DAY OF THE JACKAL' and 'MANDINGO'. The film we enjoyed because of Brando's at that time offbeat performance and the strong ensemble cast. When I went to see 'NOTHING BUT A MAN' with my friend Donald Mack, besides him commenting to me, -this ain't no movie, this is real-, I remember Ivan Dixon telling Gloria Foster in the movie that he was turning out to be just like his father. The manner in which Al Pacino portrays Michael Corleone you see this process of transformation rather than hear the character tell of it. Though in the original screenplay that I was fortunate to read recently, Michael does indeed tell his father, -and now I'm just like you.Francis Ford Coppola has made many interesting statements about this unlikely and serendipitous masterpiece he has wrought. Some of the reviewers have compared it to 'DEATH OF A SALESMAN' complete with a spaghetti dinner, and Coppola himself once compared Don Vito Corelone to King Lear, a man whose void will be hard to fill ere his Kingdom is to be kept from collapsing. Michael, as we come to discover, has the cold Machiavellian cunning, Santino has the muscular viciousness, Fredo the sweetness of a kindly sense of compassion, and Tom as the adopted son the calm deliberation for moderation, and yet not one of these individuals has all these attributes so harmoniously blended into their personality as the Don himself.And who is this Don Vito Coreleone? A man alone with his own thoughts who well realizes he could have been more than he is given an uplifting childhood environment and better circumstances. A natural leader who is even something of a statesman to hear Mario Puzo tell it in his novel, who yet and still played by Brando is a walking shell of a man able to offer his family nothing beyond their material success other than an incremental spiritual decay. Should you doubt this, review the endings of 'THE GODFATHER-II' and 'THE GODFATHER-III again. Now that I look back on it, I don't believe 'THE GODFATHER' would have become the success it is today were someone else to have acted Brando's role. There is an intelligence and a liveliness to all the portrayals from Diane Keaton to Robert Duvall to James Caan and others, but there is something haunting and understated about Brando's performance in this film that speaks to the mystery of unfulfilled human potential.
