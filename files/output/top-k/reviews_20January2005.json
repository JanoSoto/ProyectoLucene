[{"date":"20 January 2005","score":"3 out of 11 people found the following review useful","review":" I learned of the Ultimate Matrix DVD set last year, near Christmas, which was undoubtedly what it was intended to be purchased for. Since I'm in sobriety, as of River Phoenix's autopsy signature date, November 15, 1993, I have taken a keen interest in his, his family's, his friends', and colleagues' histories. He was with Keanu Reeves, as many of you know, in My Own Private Idaho, in the early 90s, where they did drugs to do the sex scenes, from which River never fully recovered, and this ultimately led to his OD, outside The Viper Room, in LA, on Halloween morning, 1993. I could write on and on about the Matrix series, which is most likely what Keanu Reeves is now known best for--and before that, it was the Bill and Ted movies. He and River tried to escape their teen idol images, by being in Gus Van Sant's horrible movie. I have a limited time, on-screen, at present, as I'm at the library and I need to get to a meeting in Mill Valley, now.To cap, I find the Matrix movies to be too violent and sexy. It should be a rating--and then, the movie wouldn't get made that way. I just did a little research on the Wachowskis, at this humongous and prominent site, where I've been harassed routinely for my November 15th story, and I just found out that Andy Wachowski's wife, Thea Bloom, filed for divorce in late 2002, because he was leaving her for a professional dominatrix, who had made him his slave! Keanu Reeves owes an apology to us, if I may be so bold. I didn't think I'd demand this, publicly, as I write him, clandestinely, via Paulie Kosta of Becky, the band they're in together with Rebecca Lord and Rob Mailhouse, but I never hear back directly anyway, so here goes!I could get much more deep, as I just heard the commentary by Cornel West and Ken Wilbur, with which I did not always agree, since I feel you cannot justify such violence and graphic sex in movies. Most out of Hollywood are this way for me--and the sex scenes in My Own Private Idaho led indirectly to River's OD. Is anyone in sobriety as of that, but me? I just think these people were lucky if they survived the Wachowskis. What is not covered in the very long DVD ultimate series is the fact that Jennifer Syme, Keanu Reeves' girlfriend, who gave stillbirth to their daughter, Ava Archer, on Christmas Eve, 1999, is not mentioned. After their break-up over this, shortly thereafter, she died in an apparent DUI, where she was the only one driving, after coming from Marilyn Manson's mansion in LA, where there'd been a party! She'd been with Reeves, apparently, just the day before, having lunch in San Francisco at Crepes on Cole, which I've never heard of, near where the burly man scene was being shot for Matrix Reloaded, among others in Alameda County! Manson's obscene music is on the first movie's soundtrack, and a video of it is included in the DVD series, unbelievably! Jennifer's mother, Maria St. John, sued Manson for wrongful death, about a year later, but he apparently has so much money that I think she lost, since he denied charges. The architect scene was filmed at that time, and it was later used in an MTV movie awards ceremony introduction, starring Justin Timberlake, which was foul about women, in this case Trinity--and made fun of Gloria Foster's role in the movies, too. Reeves gave his approval to use his image from these scenes, and it was not OK with me! Gloria Foster died of a sudden heart attack, during shooting, and Aaliyah died in a plane crash, too, that year, as well as the terrorist attacks occurring. A reason I am concerned about Reeves, in particular, when it comes to the Matrix series, is because he has been in a number of DUIs, most notably one in the 80s, where he shut his headlights off on his bike in Toganga Canyon, where he apparently lost his spleen, according to the Hardball directors' commentary! Hence, my demand for an apology!One good thing that has come of all my writing is that last fall, Johnny Depp finally gave his controlling share of The Viper Room to Anthony Fox's daughter. Fox disappeared mysteriously, after suing Depp for money. A judge was trying to shut down the club. I wrote him about my getting into sobriety, as of River's autopsy, coincidentally. I don't think it's a coincidence, really. If you look at this date in history, it is significant, and I feel the spirits convened for me.

I think after 23years I may be close to fully understanding the film. The first to be infected\/ imitated is Palmer..... When Nauls is told to turn the music down by Bennings, the suspect dog is looking for a host to hide within. We only see a shadow as he turns to the doorway to see the dog but I'll explain why it has to be Palmer. Until the blood testing scene Palmer shows no sign of infection, then just as he's blood is about to be tested, he shows the look of my game is up..... he transforms to take Windows and both are destroyed by flame throwers. So how does the Thing remain living? After it takes Palmer it can rely now completely on the diversions of the others' to remain anonymous, no-one suspects that someone else could be imitation (except Blair but not for very long) for he is quickly overtaken... as he analyzes the dogs' remains he unwittingly uses his pencil to point out that That's not dog. It looks like dog. But it ain't dog. It's imitation. Then touches his lips with the same pencil- he has started to transform from that very moment. No- one realises at that time. Blair begins to destroy the camp and shoot up the place to limit the chances of outside contact or escape for anyone, but it doesn't like the Antarctic either and has to leave to survive, and so dismantles the chopper to construct his own means of escape. That is another story how Blair can orchestrate his imprisonment so he can remain alone to engineer plans for departure out of that hostile land in which survival comes from residing in the humans or dogs which are offer no protection at all to the Arctic conditions. Both Man and Thing are equal here. Both have to fight to survive here. Not only the environment but each other to live on........anyway, We see Blair running from the helicopter, then again prior to taking Garry thats it he is part of the 75% he computes at the beginning. The computers..... we know The Chess computer is a cheat? It makes mistakes....can Blairs computer be as unreliable? Think about that one. His ploy is to remain totally unsuspecting to all, whilst destroying the camp, the transport, the blood stocks. He also sets up his only threat, Macready, by placing his torn clothing around the camp, Blair left Macready's cabin light on as well. I have more to discuss about The Thing. The fact it wasn't a hit was because it wasn't a fairytale, where everyone lived happily ever after. It looks like no-one lives even the Thing. No-one won the battle to survive. Or did they\/ it? I like to think Macready remains human, he has to be when no-one is left to fight, he still continues to finish off The Thing.... with ...k you too! and some dynamite. But if Childs had seen Blair in the final scenes there is a real chance that when he goes outside to investigate that Blair deals with him there. So Macready is a doomed human destined to be frozen with or as a monster. Regards Marty. P.S John Carpenter offers us a chance to look outside the box and think about what we see.

It isn't that we LEARNED to like the 3-part structures; but because with 2 points, you can only draw a line; for anything 3-dimensional, you need another point, a reference. If at least the first and the second part were of equal length, the movie would have been better, although it would have still felt like 2 movies.

If the point of the director was exactly to trivialize the first story, he should have arranged his movie differently, because it doesn't flow well as a movie.In fiction, we learn that any nonfiction written as a story becomes fiction. The young author is not being true to herself out of confusion; she thinks she needs to be cool to write, and is trying way too hard; her insecurities are crushed by those same people she's trying to use to achieve coolness.In nonfiction, we see a guy who wanted to be an actor when he was a teenager, succeed in making a hit documentary about a boy who wants to be an actor; the documentary feels real but funny, while the boy's life is completely artificial. But I can't make a clear parallel with fiction. Is it that any story drawn from a fiction is a non-fiction? Or is it that in this case simply life is unreal and story is real?

True this sequel really wasn't needed, much less necessary, since it's story was pretty much all told & finished with HELLBOUND HELLRAISER II, but what is here makes for a highly enjoyable entry. Many fans of the series have scoffed at this entry, since it is quiet different in tone & execution from that of the first two films, but I found the new direction in terms of it's story & execution to be a breath of fresh air & at least made it not only different than most sequels, done to popular horror franchises, but also thankfully refrains itself from merely treading the same old grounds as it's predecessors. What's interesting is how the film doesn't create new cenobites or new hells as one would have thought, another sequel might explore, especially since all the villains that populated the first two were all dead by HELLBOUND HELLRAISER II's end, but rather just expands on the originals story, relocating it from Britain to New York City (Although it is never explained why the forces of darkness chose this location, rather than staying where they were). The acting is strong here & the characters were well thought out & interesting. The major stand out is the character of J.P. MONROE, who bears a strong resemblance to the character of Frank in the first two films. A man who's sexual lusts knows no bounds, or can ever be satisfied & who is quiet a spiteful character (he even betrayed & murdered his own parents in order to obtain his vast wealth) in fact he even utters a line Frank uttered in the original film Come To Daddy as he tries to lure his naive teenage girlfriend into his clutches, to use her as a intended sacrifice to Pinhead. Speaking of Pinhead, he takes centre stage here & is shown quiet a bit, wherein the first two entries saw his appearances limned along with his followers. With the battle between him, Joey & Pinhead's good side, Elliot Spencer, being the centrepiece of the film, which makes HELLRAISER III HELL ON EARTH, a much more dualistic film than the previous entries. I really enjoyed Bradley's performance here, it's easily one of his best portrayals of Pinhead yet. You can tell he is really having a fun time in the role. He delivers his sadistic one liners with such unholy relish & sadistic glee that one almost considers it a shame, how badly his character was misused, in a series of increasingly mediocre sequels that were to follow. The direction by ANTHONY HICKOX is really good, as he is able to deliver several cool shots & captures the carnage that Pinhead & his cenobites unleash at all the right angles. The kills are cool & the gore is nice & plentiful & while Randy Miller's score is really good (We also get some of Christopher Young's musical cues from the first two films as well) a rock soundtrack mostly dominates the film, with MOTORHEADS HELLRAISER rock song being a nice fit (Rocker OZZY OSBOURNE also assists with some of the music). Another thing that a lot of fans didn't like was the Cenobite creations, calling them silly, I disagree, I thought how they were created was interesting, while it does disappointingly stray away from the chain embedded in flesh like creations of the first two, each cenobite is cleverly fashioned, based on their human indulgence & loves in life, such as a bartender who mixed & lit cocktails is turned into a fire breathing coenobite, a character who loved smoking has cigarettes lodged in her hands & throat, a cameraman has a camera turned weapon lodged in his head etc. The box itself here is no longer used as a key to enter into the dark beyond, but rather serves (this time) as more of a crucifix that would be used to ward off a vampire, as Pinhead seeks to destroy it, an act that will leave him free to terrorize mankind for all eternity. The film's budget is certainly bigger, not only is the picture slicker looking, but also featured plenty of good chase scenes & explosions. Thankfully the film doesn't make the mistake of it's predecessor, by humanizing Pinhead & going to deep into a back story. While does it does not ignore what happened in HELLBOUND HELLRAISER II, I consider it a feather in this film's cap, that it was able to take that idea (which I never liked by the way, I felt it cheapened the character & liked it best when in the original film, we assumed he was a demon that had guarded & walked up & down hell for centuries) & make it work.All in all, I highly recommend HELLRAISER III, not only does it expand on the HELLRAISER mytho's, it takes this entry in a much fresher direction & while that could so easily have spelled disaster for the film, the great news is, it doesn't hinder the franchise at all. HELLRAISER III HELL ON EARTH is just a fun, popcorn monster movie, delivering plenty of great stunts, carnage, fun characters, interesting villains & most of the series trademarks to make fans happy.

Apocalypse Now is set during the Vietnam War. It follows the quest of a man called Captain Willard who receives orders to travel up river and locate a renegade officer, the mysterious Colonel Kurtz. Once located Willard is ordered to 'terminate his command with extreme prejudice'. The only problem with this is that as the quest progresses Willard begins to see parts of himself in Kurtz and begins to identify with is intended victim.With an infamous reputation and a cast to match, I built Apocalypse Now up to be a life changing experience. One thing I can say about it is that it stands out among the bombardment of films that my brain has been subjected to over the years. It had a reputation as being a bit of a let down in Coppola's eyes as he spent far too much money for what the film eventually grossed at the box office. To be fair to Coppola, anything that follows a film as prolific and influential as the Godfather would be hard pushed to surpass its predecessor. I believe that Apocalypse Now does this and at the risk of making myself unpopular with all you film buffs out there I believe that Apocalypse Now is twice the film The Godfather is. It is a film that I attempted to watch numerous times but just couldn't concentrate on it, dare I say it I found it tedious. I just couldn't understand how it had the reputation it does. As a film man I very rarely switch a film off but I did this one, at least the first ten attempts. I then was sitting bored the other night and swore to myself that it was something I just had to do so I sat down, stuck the DVD on and started drinking a large cup of coffee. Two and a half hours later I was mesmerised. Some may say it was the coffee, I say it was the film, but never the less that night I just could not sleep with excitement. Apocalypse Now is one of the most disturbing and powerful films of all time, it reflects the true limits of the human mind and demonstrates ideally how our ideology changes in different situations.

Viewing these titles there are numerous errors to be found in it 1. It ain't humorous. 2. GM did not 'destroy' Flint. 3. The title should be Me, Me, Roger and then Me again.Let's take all these points by the hand. First off, there is little humor to be found in 'Roger and Me'. It seems Moore doesn't really have his wit or originality from The Awful Truth yet, and it shows. As voice-over, he makes some supposedly humorous observations, but everybody can do that after-wards. It's when confronted eye-to-eye Moore should be at his best, but here he's more of an observer than questioner, until after-wards he finds his tongue back in the voice-over room.The second point of which I am protesting is the claim that 'General Motors, and it's president Roger Smith in particular, destroyed Flint', the town Moore grew up in. GM simply decided it would be cheaper to move it's factories to Mexico. It's a simple, and logical, business decision, made by Smith because he is being payed to generate as much profit as he can for General Motors. Now, if Moore would have his way, then 1. Business should not do the economically best thing. 2. The USA should shut it's border for foreign products. 3. Workers should come before stockholders. Now, I am not claiming such a system to be 'communist, therefore bad', but it is a *change of system* he would want to happen, not a change of a single decision by a single company. So he shouldn't seek up Roger Smith for that, but the US president, congress, he should have held a referendum. In other words, he should be fighting politics, not cooperations.The third main problem, and we've seen it in his recent documentaries, is that Moore is a smug 'look at me, I'm so socially and politically correct' kinda person, who offers some questions but never seeks out to truly answer them. Within this documentary he follows the routine 'Rich and mean guy shuts down factories. Honest and good poor people suffer. Poor people forced to sit around doing nothing and having problems with the police because of rich guy'. End of story. There is never a true analysis, as said before, of the system, it's just picking an easy target to blame for everything that has gone wrong. And that's the end of the story. The title itself is misleading as well, as Roger Smith barely speaks a few words. In honesty, Moore tries but Smith refuses, over and over again. But years later, watching Moore unjustly slamming a good-willing Charlton Heston in 'Columbine', I'm sure Smith (if he's still alive), will see the justification for that refusal.So, what is Roger and Me then? Other than one-sided (which was to be expected), it's also a pretty boring experience. If 'Columbine' had some humor and 'Fahrenheit' had an interesting issue at an interesting time, 'Roger and Me' fails on all accounts for making a good documentary. 3\/10.

However, the film is so average and unnecessary that it feels more like the writers were perhaps so disillusioned by their assignment that they decide to see how much taking the p*ss they could get away with. Almost totally ignoring the irony of the plot, the film sets up an idiotic thriller involving the smuggling of lost paintings into the US but only really does anything with it in the final 15 or so minutes.

Meanwhile Gigi is a fresh-faced young girl who's family want her to fit into this same society and have her in ongoing training to be an eligible young lady around town; even if she doesn't understand the Parisians one little bit and can't bring herself to care about the many society rules and pieces of etiquette. While Gaston tries to rejoin the society of women and whimsy, he develops a platonic friendship with Gigi &#150; but is that all it will ever be? Following the success of My Fair Lady comes a film that has a great deal in common with it visually and in regards the songs; you could nearly blend the two together and, plot aside, at times it wouldn't seem that strange a mix. Of course, for those who loved the former then this will be a good thing and indeed, the film is pretty good if not what I had hoped for. I think it may be because I have heard the songs and have heard good things about Gigi that I maybe expected it to be more than a colourful musical &#150; but that is really all it is. The plot is very thin and it didn't engage or interest me very much at all; the songs are memorable and well written and it is they that kept me interested. The story relies heavily on the lead characters of Gaston and Gigi, which is a problem because, although they have the usual pluck required by musicals, they were never real people that I cared about.Of course the whole film looks great &#150; colourful and lavish with a nice sense of humour and I did quite enjoy it, but I couldn't shake the feeling that it didn't have much substances behind all the tunes, colour and humour. The cast try hard and mainly provide the sort of performances you would expect from the genre at the time. Caron is quite charming as the title character and does well, delivering a tomboy while also being feminine and a possible romantic interest. Jourdan is a bit flat and didn't impress me that much &#150; although that may have been part of his character rather than performance. Of course Chevalier pretty much steals every scene he is in with a delightfully comic performance and many of the best songs.Overall, fans of musicals (specifically My Fair Lady) will find much to enjoy here. I'm fairly indifferent to the whole genre but I did find it reasonably enjoyable. The songs are good and the performances are as required but it is hard to shake the feeling that a very thin plot is stretched out to a running time that it cannot comfortably fill.

Neil Howie, a sergeant with the West Highland Constabulary, arrives on Summerisle, a small Hebridean island, to investigate the case of a young girl named Rowan Morrison who has been reported as missing. To his surprise, however, the local people prove to be unhelpful to him in his search, either evading his questions or deliberately misleading him. An even greater surprise to Howie is the discovery he makes about the religious beliefs of the locals. They have abandoned Christianity and, encouraged by Lord Summerisle, the local laird, adopted a form of paganism. Howie starts to suspect that Rowan may have been murdered as a sacrifice to the island's pagan gods.The film raises some interesting philosophical issues about the nature of religious belief. Howie is a devout Christian, and is shocked by the paganism of the islanders. He is shocked partly by their open attitude to sex which conflicts with his own puritanical views, but mostly by their callousness about human life. Although the film was made in the hippy era of the early seventies, with its growing interest in alternative forms of religion, it is not a celebration of paganism. The faith of the islanders is not a benign nature-worship but rather a cruel, superstitious, mechanistic fertility cult, devoid of any genuine spirituality.The view one takes of the religious issues raised by the film will probably depend upon one's own religious views and also upon how one sees the ambiguous character of Howie. On the one hand he comes across as deeply unsympathetic- narrow-minded, dogmatic and priggish. On the other, he is the only representative we see not only of law and order but also of decency and morality. He may be a prig, but he is also the only character in the film who objects to human sacrifice on moral grounds. It seems to me that two quite different interpretations of the film are possible. On the one hand, it could be seen as a humanist critique of religion. On this reading, Howie's Christianity could be seen as merely a watered-down variety of the islanders' fierce paganism, more socially respectable but no more rational. When Howie challenges him about his beliefs, Lord Summerisle retorts with some sharp comments about the Christian doctrine of the Virgin Birth.On the other hand, it would be possible to see this as a Christian film, an exemplification of Chesterton's dictum that when men cease to believe in God, they will not believe in nothing, they will believe in anything. Summerisle and his followers do not merely reject Christianity, they also reject the entire rationalist tradition of the Enlightenment. They believe that human sacrifice will ensure the success of their harvests and that illnesses can be cured by placing a toad in the sufferer's mouth. Howie stands not only for orthodox theology but also for orthodox science. Religion and science are sometimes portrayed as being in conflict, but it can also be argued that science has had a beneficent effect upon religion; by removing material affairs such as the cure of the sick and the fertility of the soil from the hands of priests and shamans and entrusting them to doctors and agronomists, it has freed contemporary Christianity from these concerns and enabled it to concentrate more on spiritual matters.I normally like films that tackle weighty themes and ask difficult questions without necessarily providing easy answers, so I am disappointed that I did not like The Wicker Man more. It seems unfortunate that so many versions exist; I have seen two on British television, both different from one another and neither the full director's cut. I will therefore reserve my comments on the direction until I have seen the definitive version, but neither of the versions I have seen flowed easily. The famous ending is genuinely shocking (as Goya said, the sleep of reason produces monsters), but what leads up to it does not always tell the story with any fluency.The acting was too often wooden and lifeless. In the case of Edward Woodward as Howie this was presumably deliberate, as his character is supposed to be a stiff, formal individual who finds it difficult to show emotion, but none of the other characters seemed any more animated. Christopher Lee as Summerisle had too much of the urbane British gentleman about him and not enough of the religious fanatic. The worst contribution came from Britt Ekland, who wandered through the film as though she did not know what she was doing in it. Come to that, I wasn't sure what she was doing, either. A body double was used for her dance scene, her singing voice was dubbed and (according to some accounts) her speaking voice was too, apparently because she could not manage a convincing Scottish accent. She was presumably only hired because the film-makers thought that to have a glamorous international star in the cast-list would be good for the takings at the box-office.Despite these weaknesses, the film is often thought-provoking, and there is enough of interest to make it worth watching. 6\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"20 January 2005","score":"32 out of 55 people found the following review useful","review":" Although The Wicker Man is sometimes classified as a horror film, it starts off like a standard police detective drama.

Not Another Teen Movie is one of those movies where you sometimes cringe from the gross humor, but it also has some good written scenes. It's spoofs movies from the 80's and 90's, so it's not based only around the 90's teen movies. It spoofs such movies as The Breakfast Club, Pretty In Pink, Varsity Blues, Ten Things I Hate About You, and the movie they spoof the most, She's All That. Joel Gallen is the director for this movie, and I have to say, for his first movie, he did pretty good. Some parts are hard to watch though. Like the scene when the 3 teen boys climb through the vent, trying to spy on girls in the locker room and bathroom stalls. They end up spying on a girl going to the bathroom, and fall through the ceiling into the stall, where they fall into a classroom, where the poo shoots out from the toilet onto them. It is a pretty hard-to-watch scene, but most scenes are funny, although I wouldn't recommend this movie to older adults or younger kids. The actors perform pretty well, with some good cameos, especially from Molly Ringwald from The Breakfast Club.

However his own brother, Edward holds the throne and Richard is only in line for the throne after Edward's two sons and his brother Clarence; so he plots to remove all those that stand in his way but reach the throne with no suspicion aimed at him. While trying to get to grips with the difficulties of delivering Richard III to a modern audience, Al Pacino shows us the rehearsals with American actors as well as discussions with scholars and fans on their thoughts about Shakespeare's play.This film sounds like a hard sell, and indeed, with the majority of the modern audience never having seen or read Richard III, it seems unlikely that a documentary about the production of the play would be anything other than a love-in of sorts. However Pacino manages to translate his enthusiasm for the subject into an enjoyable film that interests and entertains on several levels. The first thing the film does tis to provide an abridged version of the play, with explanation throughout; this works because it shares the passion for the play with the audience &#150; a play, it must be said, that is very difficult to fully understand. I remember the last time I saw a version of it was in New York in a $1 cinema; I saw it with my friend and a group of others &#150; I remember that the Latino girl who was in the group was simply lost and couldn't keep up with the dialogue &#150; of course I struggled a bit as well but I wasn't going to tell her that since she was ****ing gorgeous! Anyway, while doing this the film also looks at the deeper meaning of the play as well as taking time to talk to all sorts of people about the wider issue of Shakespeare to a modern audience.I would love to be knowledgeable about Shakespeare because I do try but the truth is that I do find it difficult and will usually read the play after I see a production (cinema or theatre) of it. So to me, this was a great film simply because it did give me an understanding of the play while also providing lots of interesting discussion. Some of it doesn't totally work and bits of it feel like they have been semi-staged (pardon the pun), meanwhile the actual play is delivered in a very sparse manner but, considering how wide the film grasps, these minor problems can be forgiven. Of the cast involved (which are stellar) Pacino is the standout; whether he is playing Richard or walking the streets talking to all manner of people his enthusiasm comes through in every scene and the film is very much his baby. He is ably supported by a cast of actors that includes Ryder, Spacey, Baldwin, Conway, Quinn, Yulin and many other recognisable faces. Commendable is the way that the film does give time to all sorts of people &#150; those that know nothing but are bluffing opinions, scholars, academics or, amusingly, people who can kindly be described as colourful.Overall this is a great film that maybe doesn't sound that good but honestly is.

Largely unintentionally, it is hilarious. Casino is probably the blackest of black comedies. After I'd seen it about the fourth time or so, I found myself cracking up over the non-stop cursing, the meanness and pettiness, and the over-the-top violence.

A crew of oil workers on a submersible drilling platform, led by Ed Harris, are reluctantly asked by the U.S. Navy to assist in a rescue operation involving a sunken nuclear submarine. So far so good. Then a violent hurricane cuts them off from the surface and the rest of the outside world leaving the survivors stranded underwater in their now damaged rig. Still good.Then this wet, otherworldly aqua-phallic thing shows up and this is where things start to go downhill. This movie would have been much better as a straight up action\/adventure yarn but no, Mr. Jim had to crap it up with these Sci-Fi elements that in my opinion just don't work. Don't get me wrong, I really like Science Fiction, but it just didn't belong in this movie. The filmmakers tried too hard to give us a sense of wonder and all I got out of it was a sense of embarrassment. Especially when Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio spits out the line, It's the most beautiful thing I've ever seen!. She actually had to shut her eyes for that one.I dunno, maybe I'm being too hard on it. The cast is good. The production design and FX are first rate. I just wish it hadn't ended on such a cutesy\/corny note.

You are on your own to try to figure out - everything you need to know is right there), and funny (Yes, Greenaway can be funny!) art film - the perfect example of an art film. It combines the elements of social satire with murder mystery, meditates on the power of art and role of an artist, studies family drama and mothers &#150; daughters love and understanding, perfectly wraps it in sensual pleasure - and what the pleasure it is. I know I will watch it again because it is a feast for eyes (I've seen big budget movies that looked plain comparing to this one shot on the limited funds), ears (Michael Nyman wrote one of the best score ever for this film) and for brain - there are mysteries and puzzles in every frame and in every dialog.There is couple of Greenaway's thoughts on his first film and on the films that influenced him from the interview that was published in L'Avant-Scene Cinema, No 333, October 1984 Majority of my films may be viewed on several levels. Thus, in The Draughtsman's Contract there was the desire to open the symbolism of plants and fruits, to study the connections between the aristocrats and the common people, the conflicts between the worlds of gentlemen and of servants. With my films, I hope to generate interest, to stimulate imagination, to wake feelings...I consider that 90% of my films one way or another refers to paintings. Contract quite openly refers to Caravaggio, Georges de la Tour and other French and Italian artists...Before the work on the film began, I did not explain to film crew what I wanted, but I showed them five European films Fellini's Casanova, The Last Tango in Paris by Bertolucci, The Marquise of O by Eric Rohmer, Chronicle of Anna Magdalena Bach by Jean-Marie Straub and, most importantly, Last Year at Marienbad by Alain Resnais which has been the most influential film for me.

As the real Santa Claus the man (Kris Kringle) steps in and summons the police &#150; but finds himself escorted away. However, when the drunk can't do his job, Kris steps in and is so good that he is offered the job of store Santa by Cole's toy store. Taking the job, Kris is in his element but cannot convince his boss's daughter that he is the real deal. Things get worse when a rival store, so worried by the business Kris is drawing to Cole's, set out to set him up and taking him to court to get sectioned. Can Kris prove he is Santa, not only to Susan but also to New York State.It is a weakness of Christmas TV that so many interesting movies are wheeled out on so many channels that, in late January, I'm watching a movie that never really sees the light of day outside of the month before Christmas. Anyway, when this came out I ended up going to see it at the cinema and felt that it worked as a Christmas movie but was somewhat lacking as a film. Watching it on television now it seems a lot more serviceable, feeling more suited to the small screen rather than the large. Of course you could question why anyone felt the need to remake the original film but, now they have, I suppose at least it is reasonably good. The plot starts enjoyably enough and features an enjoyable court case, it is only in the sentimental conclusion where it became an average film; up till this point it is structured enough to be enjoyable even if it is a bit straight but at the end it succumbs to the season but does it too late to really do damage.Slighter older children will enjoy it even though I felt like it could have had more of an edge for adults to appreciate as well. The cast are good, although the film noticeably drops when Attenborough is offscreen. He is an affable character and creates a sense of wonder that the film really benefits from; he is well matched by a cute but enjoyable performance from Wilson. The rest of the cast don't have it so good and Perkins and McDermott are really left with a difficult serious narrative that is only going to mush. The supporting cast has a lot of well-known faces who are interesting even if they only have minor roles; Walsh, Remar, Prosky, Janney and Ackland all provide an interesting cast even if the whole film belongs to Attenborough.Overall this is an OK film that will play well to older children as well as undemanding adults. Parts of the film are overly sentimental and devoid of the clever modern touches that it could have really had if it had not done it so straight. Hardly earth shattering stuff but has enough festive cheer to do the job, partly thanks to a performance from Attenborough that adds a sense of wonder to it.
