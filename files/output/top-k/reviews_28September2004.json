","genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Fantasy"},{"date":"28 September 2004","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":"  I will be honest. When I first began this film, upon seeing the first ten minutes, I was frightened. Not because there was anything to be frightened about, but because of the low-grade production value that was very clear. The cheap sets, the cheesy actors with horrible English dubbing, coupled with a soundtrack that could easily raise the dead, I was ready to watch this film crash and burn. Oddly, this only happened within the first ten minutes, once Harker gets to Dracula's castle, we are handed huge portions of the meat and potatoes of this film. Nosferatu transforms right in front of your eyes from a cheesy horror flick to a mind-bending horror classic that deserves the cult following it has obtained. This was one of those films that you should sit and enjoy throughout the entire film, and do not judge it on just the first few minutes. Get into the story, and I think you will be impressed.There were two parts that stuck out the most in my mind. These were two scenes that proved to me that I was in fact witnessing cinema in its rawest form. The first is when Dracula is running down the streets of Virna seemingly random, but imaginatively pure. He is searching for the woman he dreams about, Lucy Harker. He has the expression of a kid in a candy store for the very first time. This is classic avant-garde film-making at its best. You could tell that money was tight for this production, but somehow the masterful eye of director Werner Herzog kept it all together. His scenes were, to say the least, brilliant. There were some very starchy moments, but all together he kept a very vivacious spirit alive in this film. Again, it just took about ten minutes to get into the full package of Nosferatu. The second favorite scene of mine is the stoic Last Supper scene that confused me at first, but after finishing the film made much more sense. The plague was infesting this little town, and the citizens knew they were going to die &#133; immorality was a desire of only one person, Dracula, so why not celebrate in the best way possible. I know there are other ways to see this scene, but I just saw a hopeless class of people living life for the possible last time. It was visionary and beautiful all at the same time.While these scenes really helped create the aura of the film, it was purely the work of the actors that kept my mind focused on the screen. My favorite of all the characters presented was Roland Topor's portrayal of Renfield. His sinister, yet uncontrolled, laughter spooked me. His face was goofy, and believable. He embodied the sense of insanity and used it well for his character. Second, was Kinski as Dracula. Where did they find this guy? I do not believe that vanity was anywhere included in his vision of Dracula.He was scary, curious, and insatiable all at the same time. His portrayal of Dracula beats Gary Oldman any day (I have not seen the 1922 version with Shreck &#133; so I stand to what I say &#133; for now). Overall, everyone from Lucy Harker to a very unused Van Helsing was superb and really carried this film off the ground.The only disappointing aspect of this film was the DVD. Normally, I can look past horrible reproductions of film as they gradually make it to digital format, but this was uncalled for. Here we have a beautiful film with some very good acting and direction, and all we have is a Chapters menu and Start Film. I was sad to see this.

When I first began this film, upon seeing the first ten minutes, I was frightened. Not because there was anything to be frightened about, but because of the low-grade production value that was very clear. The cheap sets, the cheesy actors with horrible English dubbing, coupled with a soundtrack that could easily raise the dead, I was ready to watch this film crash and burn. Oddly, this only happened within the first ten minutes, once Harker gets to Dracula's castle, we are handed huge portions of the meat and potatoes of this film. Nosferatu transforms right in front of your eyes from a cheesy horror flick to a mind-bending horror classic that deserves the cult following it has obtained. This was one of those films that you should sit and enjoy throughout the entire film, and do not judge it on just the first few minutes. Get into the story, and I think you will be impressed.There were two parts that stuck out the most in my mind. These were two scenes that proved to me that I was in fact witnessing cinema in its rawest form. The first is when Dracula is running down the streets of Virna seemingly random, but imaginatively pure. He is searching for the woman he dreams about, Lucy Harker. He has the expression of a kid in a candy store for the very first time. This is classic avant-garde film-making at its best. You could tell that money was tight for this production, but somehow the masterful eye of director Werner Herzog kept it all together. His scenes were, to say the least, brilliant. There were some very starchy moments, but all together he kept a very vivacious spirit alive in this film. Again, it just took about ten minutes to get into the full package of Nosferatu. The second favorite scene of mine is the stoic Last Supper scene that confused me at first, but after finishing the film made much more sense. The plague was infesting this little town, and the citizens knew they were going to die &#133; immorality was a desire of only one person, Dracula, so why not celebrate in the best way possible. I know there are other ways to see this scene, but I just saw a hopeless class of people living life for the possible last time. It was visionary and beautiful all at the same time.While these scenes really helped create the aura of the film, it was purely the work of the actors that kept my mind focused on the screen. My favorite of all the characters presented was Roland Topor's portrayal of Renfield. His sinister, yet uncontrolled, laughter spooked me. His face was goofy, and believable. He embodied the sense of insanity and used it well for his character. Second, was Kinski as Dracula. Where did they find this guy? I do not believe that vanity was anywhere included in his vision of Dracula.He was scary, curious, and insatiable all at the same time. His portrayal of Dracula beats Gary Oldman any day (I have not seen the 1922 version with Shreck &#133; so I stand to what I say &#133; for now). Overall, everyone from Lucy Harker to a very unused Van Helsing was superb and really carried this film off the ground.The only disappointing aspect of this film was the DVD. Normally, I can look past horrible reproductions of film as they gradually make it to digital format, but this was uncalled for.

In Richard Kelly's case, even more, since he was a first time director, with a cast of mostly unknowns and a plot beyond comprehension, for some. The masses rejected it, but just like Lynch, Kelly found his audience. Which i now, know, is more than just a cult. Donnie Darko (Jake Gyllenhal) is a trouble teen, living in small town America, among other troubled teens. What's special about Donnie is that, he has visions, which kind of translates to him waking up in strange places in the morning and visiting a psychiatrist. The rest of the story is more or less the usual, the new girl (Jena Malone) comes into town etc... Well, the thing is, the world kind of ends and an engine falls into Darko's bedroom. Not so usual. Weirdness ensues...I won't get into the trouble of actually explaining what it all means. Donnie Darko is one of those awesome movies, like 2001, which can translate into anything you want them to. Obviously, there is some point, which the director intended--(SPOILER)it is all leading to sacrifice(SPOILER), but the rest of the void, you have to fill in as you like. People have said, it is a meaningless, confusing garbage or something close to that. All i have to say to them is that they maybe can't fill their own void, let alone Donnie Darko's... To me this movie is a real journey(or a trip if you like) and as i grow up and obviously watching this over and over, i find myself discovering new things, but ultimately i just discover myself. And that's the beauty of it and ultimately all the movies in general. I have to mention of course, the work that has been done by the cast and crew. Kelly, for whom i foresee a great future, has a magnificent eye for detail and a taste that even though it did estrange me just a tine bit at first, after repeated viewings, i became really familiar with it. And he certainly knows a lot about how to set the mood for a film, this puppy just grabs you from minute 1 and doesn't let you go... even when it's all over. It also has a very handsome photography, nicely dressed sets, effective special F\/X and a cool soundtrack. And of course, kudos to Drew Barrymore for supporting this flick, she did the cinematic world a huge favor and she may have discovered a new Orson Welles. By now, we all know that MAggie and JAck ( Gyllenhal) are the new Joan and John(Cusack) of the decade--able to carry a movie on their shoulders and having the charisma to look adorable while doing it! Basically the entire cast of Donnie Darko deserves a praise, but they are just too many to mention here, great acting all around. Finally, i just like to say that if you actually have yet to see this movie and you agree that Kubrick is THE MAN, Leone KICKS ASS, Gilliam ROCKS and Whedon is a GENIUS and obviously KElly is the next Welles, then i think you'll just have a life changing experience.

So was Keitel's. I didn't like either, and that's actually pretty rare. There's almost always a redeeming quality in even the worst of characters. These two were cold fish. The only one I felt even the slightest bit for, was Ruth's mom. She might have been the caricature many say she was, but at least I understood her. She didn't even try to be like, so complex and all that.I also didn't understand why the women were so attracted to Keitel's character. Maybe there was a danger aspect that somehow failed to come through? Even so, I couldn't help but guffaw when all these beautiful women threw themselves at him. Please.

Was this whole bi-thing there just to show how out of control she is? To show how much of a lost soul she is? Just because she kissed a girl? That's a bit old fashioned, don't you think?And the big pee-scene. You who claim that we just don't get it, could you explain what it means? Why did she pee herself? Somekind of animal thing? People often lose control of their bladder\/bowel when they die or face death. Is this a symbolic death? Maybe I should email the Campions.The rest of the movie is pretty gross. I can't get a hold on the characters, they are annoying, petty and disturbed. The sex was unnecessary, and the plot was going every which way.

I have a great deal of respect for the man and all that he's accomplished, but let's face it, he's tried on a number of different levels and comedy simply isn't his forte.Marisa Tomei's performance was refreshingly amusing, but not nearly enough to make the film worth watching, much less earn her an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress. This brings me to the first of two reasons that I decided to Contribute my two cents toward such an awful movie. I recently saw a film in which Tomei plays a similar comedic yet provocative supporting role.

The fact that the case was closed with no evidence other than the positive traction tire marks from a crime scene photograph is absolutely ludicrous, not to mention an insult to anyone who knows better.The film was released in 1992 and set in the same time frame.

Of course Julianne Moore's performance was great because, basically, it always is.

Along with Labyrinth he had another great, wondrous film that was frowned upon by critics, The Dark Crystal. But I guess not many appreciate the great minds that come with creating movies like Labyrinth. I remember watching Labyrinth when I was just nine years old and then a few years after that. It was a family thing to sit down when it played on the cable movie channels. Now that I am a Mom and a lot older, I think more people today should appreciate the effort and great minds that go into making these original characters, making them come alive. When I first seen the movie I was infatuated with David Bowie just for the fact he seemed so sexy but I didn't even know who he was.After graduating high school I grew to appreciate David Bowie's past and current musical triumphs along with his portrayal of Jereth in Labyrinth. Every song was genius and about 95% were created by Bowie himself. My ultimate fave song in the whole movie is As the World Falls Down and the scene itself was enchanting. It seemed a world you wouldn't want leave. But throughout the movie it just made me laugh and just hypnotized me. I know the late Jim Henson was proud of all his achievements with the muppets and his creations such as Labyrinth. Though it was looked down by the movie critics Labyrinth is a masterpiece, a perfect example of the genius minds of Jim Henson and Frank Oz, also all the performers and master of doll making. I would suggest anyone to allow their children to have the pleasure of viewing this movie. As my daughter has also. I believe it shows that with a brilliant imagination and extreme talent you can make the biggest fantasies come true and be so real you are caught up in the world itself.

Along with Labyrinth he had another great, wondrous film that was frowned upon by critics, The Dark Crystal. But I guess not many appreciate the great minds that come with creating movies like Labyrinth. I remember watching Labyrinth when I was just nine years old and then a few years after that. It was a family thing to sit down when it played on the cable movie channels. Now that I am a Mom and a lot older, I think more people today should appreciate the effort and great minds that go into making these original characters, making them come alive. When I first seen the movie I was infatuated with David Bowie just for the fact he seemed so sexy but I didn't even know who he was.After graduating high school I grew to appreciate David Bowie's past and current musical triumphs along with his portrayal of Jereth in Labyrinth. Every song was genius and about 95% were created by Bowie himself. My ultimate fave song in the whole movie is As the World Falls Down and the scene itself was enchanting.

O'Toole's Henry is not merely larger than life, he's Macy Balloon sized larger than life. Oh God, but I do love being king! O'Toole bellows at one point, and it is clear O'Toole loves playing one as well. It takes an actress of the caliber of Katherine Hepburn to not disappear alongside a performance like that.Henry, in love with his mistress Alais who is promised by treaty for the marriage of his oldest surviving son Richard, anxiuos for the succession to the throne for the sake of the empire he has built, calls to a palace in his French possessions his three sons, Richard, a fierce and determined warrior who is his mother's favorite - and a favorite of the King of France, as it turns out - the deep-revolving, ignored and unloved middle son Geoffery, and the dull witted youngest son Johnny, his father's pet and choice for succession. He also temporarliy frees the Great Bitch from her prison, his wife, Eleanor of Acquitaine, who he has kept walled up in a castle for ten years, and calls Phillip, the youthful King of France and the son of Eleanor's first husband, in for negotiations. As soon as all five arrive at the castle, they begin to plot with and against and for each other, with Alais, the crown, and Acquitaine as the pawns. No one in tha family likes anyone else, no one is loyal to any one else, and all are willing to betray anyone to win.Are they so different from any unhappy family, whose uneasy alliances and betrayals occur over subjects less momentous to outsiders than a crown? Well, as Eleanor put it, what family doesn't have its ups and downs? All of the major actors - O'Toole and Hepburn, John Castle, a very early Anthony Hopkins and Timothy Daulton, stoop-shouldered, drooling, self pitying Nigel Terry - attack their roles with evident relish. The screenplay sometimes descends to faux profundities and leaden pronouncements, but never for too long. The dialogue sparkles with wit and verbal imagination.But crowning it all off, of course, are Hepburn and O'Toole.
