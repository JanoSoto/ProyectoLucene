I've seen a lot of movies, a lot of bad movies, but this one is at the top of the list and nothing else is even close. Oh, of course there are movies that are much worse-made in all aspects, but when you consider the 'Friday the 13th' franchise being utilized and the results obtained, nothing compares.There is not one single redeeming quality in this movie. Not only am I surprised this did not go straight to video, it should never have even been given that honor. 'Jason X' reeks of bad-TV-movie from beginning to end. I don't even know that I would go so far as to say TV-movie. It reminds me something that would be categorized as the worst episode of the worst sci-fi series ever. From the terrible camera work, to the horrible special effects, to the embarrassing over-acting, to the ridiculously cheesy soundtrack, to the childish script, this movie has 'amateur' written all over it.When it goes for laughs, it fails miserably. The only laughing you will do during this movie will be unintentional on the part of the director, I guarantee that. On the other hand, there are absolutely no worthy scares. Of quite possibly the cheapest way to get scares - jump scenes - I counted one. And as I said, they are cheap. As for gore, there is nothing here that is worth anybody's time. I would guess that on half the kills, the camera cuts away just before the money shot. This is the business of a PG-rated movie, not an R-rated Jason film. Inexcusable. What gore they do show is laughable at best.In horror movies, you are supposed to like the characters and be rooting for them to survive. When characters then do die, it is that much harder to watch. In 'Jason X', you are rooting for everyone to die as painful a death as possible.and you don't even get that satisfaction.And on top of everything is the complete implausibility of the whole situation.

Among them were Mike Myers and Dana Carvey who created some of the most memorable characters Wayne Campbell and Garth Algar. A bunch of Saturday Night Live movies were released, some were gigantic hits like Blues Brothers and some were misses Coneheads(which I loved by the way). Wayne's World was nothing on Saturday Night Live but two stoners who just ragged on things, how could you make it into a full feature length film? Not only did Penelope Spheeris do it, she knocked it out of the ball park with Wayne's World. It's one of the funniest movies that you could ever see with one of the most memorable scenes in comedy history making Bohemian Rhapsody by Queen shoot back up to number one on the charts.Wayne Campbell and Garth Algar are the hosts of Wayne's World in Aurora, Illinois, where they ogle pictures of beautiful celebrity women, play air guitar and drums, and interview local people, indirectly making fun of them over. One day Benjamin, a television station executive, when he finds out how many people watch the show, he instructs his producer Russell Finley to find out where the show is taped, telling him they may have an opportunity for a huge sponsorship. Benjamin shows up next week in Wayne's basement and introduces himself after the show ends. He offers to buy the rights to the show and to keep Wayne and Garth on for what he describes as a huge salary. Little do they know that they are about to be sold out.The cast had this absolutely amazing chemistry that made this film work in all the right places adding new characters with Tia Carrere, Rob Lowe, and Kurt Fuller. I love this scene where Wayne and his girlfriend Cassandra go into a music store and he starts the riff on the guitar playing Led Zepplin's song Stairway to Heaven and the sales associate points to the sign that says No Stairway to Heaven, thank you for that message! I love Wayne's reaction to it as well No Stairway? Denied!, too funny. Also they meet Alice Cooper, who I met as a little girl, and he is one of the most intelligent people you could meet in real life and I loved how they captured it in this movie showing that Alice is a character, in real life he's incredibly intelligent, gentle and cool. He tells Wayne and Garth to hang with them and they just get down on their knees screaming We're not worthy! and he leans his hand out so they could kiss it! I nearly died laughing at the scene where the T2 pulls Wayne over showing him the picture of John Conner Have you seen this boy?. I loved the multiple endings. There isn't a thing I would change with this movie, it's a great comedy that is just guaranteed to make you laugh till your sides hurt.

It is wonderful, and I am glad not to be the only one to recognize that Pacino's character's name is a joke by the Devil.On that point, I just want to say that I think this movie provides one of the most convincing portrayal's of the Devil's character I've seen or read since the wonderful one crafted by Milton himself (Paradise Lost, the greatest single piece of English-language literature of all time).  As in Paradise Lost, the Devil's Advocate gives the Devil a realistic personality, something almost never done in any venue.  Yes, the character is so passionately acted that some have accused Pacino of overacting, but a spirit so passionate as to actually vow eternal war against God, whom he knows from personal experience to be Omnipotent, has got to be pretty fiery (if you'll pardon the term).  In Devil's Advocate, like in Milton, the Devil's statements and arguments are pretty persuasive if you're not careful, and you might be halfway convinced that the writer is on his side. This is important, because at first glance it's hard to imagine why a supernaturally intelligent being would commit himself to a hopeless battle against his all-powerful Creator.  Because of this, I at least always have the sneaking misgiving that the Devil must be a moron, at least when you consider things practically.  This movie presents him as a being who can be pretty convincing, almost idealistic, in his reasons for rebelling, though no doubt he's not being completely honest.As far as the people who keep putting down Keanu Reeves, I agree with the writer of the primary commentary that he is an underrated actor and wrongly maligned.  True, he is not an a par with Pacino, but he certainly can hold his own with him.  There must be something there, because he's been in many movies with some of the best actors in the business, and always comes across just fine.  For those people who have some axe to grind against him I have the following advice  Don't go to see his movies!In summary, I really loved this movie, even more than eating large quantities of chocolate.

For those people who have some axe to grind against him I have the following advice  Don't go to see his movies!In summary, I really loved this movie, even more than eating large quantities of chocolate. ","genre":"Drama, Mystery, Thriller"},{"date":"18 November 2003","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":"  Possible spoilersI just want to agree wholeheartedly with the primary viewer assessment of this movie.  It is wonderful, and I am glad not to be the only one to recognize that Pacino's character's name is a joke by the Devil.On that point, I just want to say that I think this movie provides one of the most convincing portrayal's of the Devil's character I've seen or read since the wonderful one crafted by Milton himself (Paradise Lost, the greatest single piece of English-language literature of all time).  As in Paradise Lost, the Devil's Advocate gives the Devil a realistic personality, something almost never done in any venue.  Yes, the character is so passionately acted that some have accused Pacino of overacting, but a spirit so passionate as to actually vow eternal war against God, whom he knows from personal experience to be Omnipotent, has got to be pretty fiery (if you'll pardon the term).  In Devil's Advocate, like in Milton, the Devil's statements and arguments are pretty persuasive if you're not careful, and you might be halfway convinced that the writer is on his side. This is important, because at first glance it's hard to imagine why a supernaturally intelligent being would commit himself to a hopeless battle against his all-powerful Creator.  Because of this, I at least always have the sneaking misgiving that the Devil must be a moron, at least when you consider things practically.  This movie presents him as a being who can be pretty convincing, almost idealistic, in his reasons for rebelling, though no doubt he's not being completely honest.As far as the people who keep putting down Keanu Reeves, I agree with the writer of the primary commentary that he is an underrated actor and wrongly maligned.  True, he is not an a par with Pacino, but he certainly can hold his own with him.  There must be something there, because he's been in many movies with some of the best actors in the business, and always comes across just fine.  For those people who have some axe to grind against him I have the following advice  Don't go to see his movies!In summary, I really loved this movie, even more than eating large quantities of chocolate.

Just because it is such a loved film, how could you not love it? It has action, romance, revenge, sword fights, true love, humor, friendship, etc. I was only 2 when this film was released, but I still remember how much I was in love with this film at 4. I would rewind the tape and watch it over and over again, the funny thing was my parents wouldn't mind watching it with me, it appeals to children as well as adults. I think the reason why this was such a fantastic film was due to the fact that it was the perfect mixture of a fairy tale with humor, action, and romance. Rob Reiner really knew what he was doing when he made this movie; and it all starts with a grandfather simply reading his favorite childhood story to his sick grandson.Buttercup and Wesley are two farm people who eventually fall deeply in love, but in order to get money to get married, Wesley goes off to find a job and start a life for them. But when Buttercup hears of Wesley's death by pirates, she is taken away by Prince Humperdinck who is about to make her his bride. She is then kidnapped by three rebels who wish to start a war with the prince, Vizzini, Fezzik, and Indigo Montoya(who is on a revenge streak to kill the six fingered man who killed his father). But she is saved by an unknown pirate who later reveals himself as Wesley who escaped death, but Buttercup is taken once again right as she and Wesley are reunited by Prince Humperdinck. The prince orders to torture Wesley and kill him to keep him away from Buttercup, but Wesley ends up being saved by Fezzik and Indigo who will help him save Buttercup.The Princess Bride is a classic film that will never be forgotten. It has classic lines like Hello, my name is Inigo Montoya, you killed my father prepare to die. And of course INCONCEIVABLE repeated constantly by Vizzini. The acting is perfect and the sets are just amazing. Of course who could forget Billy Cristal and Carol Cane's great performance of the miracle worker and his wife? They were just priceless. Please watch this movie, it's one of those movies that's just impossible not to like, why not to like it would be inconceivable.10\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"18 November 2003","score":"57 out of 78 people found the following review useful","review":" The Princess Bride is one of those rare, but very perfect films that everyone once in their life time has seen.

I was only 8 years old and I had no idea what I was in for when I watched this movie. I was terrified but so enchanted by this world. Steven Spielberg brought back the dinosaur genre, a genre that was only used with caveman movies. Not to mention did it with incredible special effects. I remember seeing this movie for the first time and asked my mom if the dinosaurs were real or if they made giant robots. Those dinosaurs not only looked real but were absolutely terrifying. But what an adventure we took with Jurassic Park, the land where anything could happen with a crazy billionaire and upset employees who pretty much destroy the world for a nickel. One of the most memorable movies of all time that still holds up to this day, Jurassic Park is a film not to be missed.Billionaire John Hammond, has recently created Jurassic Park a theme park populated with dinosaurs cloned from the DNA extracted from insects preserved in prehistoric amber. After a park worker is attacked by a dinosaur, Hammond's investors, demand that experts visit the park and verify that it is safe. Gennaro invites Dr. Ian Malcolm, a mathematician, while Hammond invites paleontologist Dr. Alan Grant and paleobotanist Dr. Ellie Sattler. They are joined on the island by Hammond's two grandchildren Tim and Lex. Hammond asks Malcolm, Grant, and Sattler what their thoughts are about having recreated dinosaur species. The group sets off to explore the park. The head computer programmer, Dennis Nedry, is secretly in the employ of one of InGen's corporate rivals, and has been paid to steal fertilized dinosaur embryos. During his theft, Nedry deactivates the park's security system, allowing him access to the embryo storage. The group is now parked in front of the T-Rex's cage and now they are fighting for their lives in Jurassic Park.I think one of the most memorable scenes is definitely the raptors chasing the children in the kitchen. What a tense scene that made you hold your breath the whole way through. You have to love Jeff Goldblum in this movie, when he tries to save the children from the T-Rex and instead pretty much gets his butt kicked, he gets saved later and as they are chased in the car by the T-Rex the only thing he can say as this giant monster is catching up faster and faster with each footstep, he says must go faster so calmly, how funny! But there is a moment that scares me more than the dinosaurs that I'm surprised no one noticed in the editing room, the granddaughter is scared to death screaming at Sam Neill that the lawyer left them and he replies with a dark look that's not what I'm going to do. I responded that with I have much darker plans for you, I mean his look was just so creepy! I digress, Jurassic Park is still a very fun movie that is the ultimate adventure. It's timeless and I can't wait to show my kids one day, what a great movie with wonderful effects and a wonderful cast and crew.9\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"18 November 2003","score":"34 out of 37 people found the following review useful","review":" My first epic movie to see on the big screen was Jurassic Park.

Now granted I know that there was a few flaws with this film as I grew up and noticed that maybe Kevin Costner's accent wasn't so British or Christian Slater's. But if we all always complained about accents, I think we wouldn't enjoy movies as much. I love Robin Hood because it has action, adventure, romance, horror, magic, everything you can imagine is in this film. Not to mention that I think we got pretty darn good performances. My personal favorite is out of Alan Rickman as the Sheriff of Nottingham, he is absolutely hilarious and a terrific villain. This is my favorite Robin Hood story of all time.Robin of Locksley, an English nobleman, is captured and jailed in a dungeon in Jerusalem along with his comrade, Peter. With their execution inevitable, Robin engineers an escape, saving the life of a Moor, Azeem in the process; Peter dies in the attempt and has Robin swear to protect his sister Marian. Robin makes the long journey back to England with Azeem, who claims he must accompany Robin until the debt of saving his life is repaid. In England, with King Richard I gone, the cruel Sheriff of Nottingham rules over the land with fear, aided by his brute cousin, Guy of Gisbourne along with the precognitive evil witch, Mortianna , and the corrupt Bishop of Hereford. At Locksley castle, Robin's kind father Lord Locksley has been killed by the Sheriff's men, after refusing to join them for the Sheriff's unknown but treacherous scheme. Robin and Azeem arrive to find Robin's formerly luxurious abode of Locksley Castle destroyed and his father, murdered. Lord Locksley's loyal servant, Duncan, has survived, though his eyes were removed. With his lands and reputation gone Robin swears to avenge his father's murder. Robin then begins by seeking out, Maid Marian, the cousin of the king and his childhood friend. He is immediately attracted to Marian, although she does not return the feelings, which poses a problem because Nottingham also has his sights set on her. While Robin, Azeem and Duncan escape the revenge seeking Gisboune and his soldiers, they seek shelter in the Forest of Sherwood, where they come across Little John, and a large group of woodsmen, all of whom were outlawed through the tyranny of the Sheriff. After proving his skill in single combat, Robin is accepted into their group and eventually becomes their leader, though Will Scarlet, one of Robin's men, is constantly undermining his leadership. Robin encourages his men to fight back against Nottingham and begins to train them to defend themselves while they build weapons and homes in the forest, it's their time to take it back.If you haven't seen Robin Hood Prince of Thieves I highly recommend that you do, honestly I don't know why anyone would not enjoy this film just a little bit. Like I said, it has everything to make a film great. My favorite scene, hard to choose from so many, is the ending battle scene where they discover that Robin Hood is alive and he is there at the castle to save his beloved Marian, it's a great scene that keeps you on the edge of your seat. So please just get past the accents, give this movie a chance, it's a terrific story and a wonderful movie that I will still watch and probably will even more so as I grow older. Besides I have to just to see Alan Rickman threaten Robin Hood with a spoon, lol, greatest threat ever.10\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"18 November 2003","score":"82 out of 101 people found the following review useful","review":" Robin Hood Prince of Thieves is a movie that I've watched since I was a little girl and I still to this day absolutely adore it.

At Locksley castle, Robin's kind father Lord Locksley has been killed by the Sheriff's men, after refusing to join them for the Sheriff's unknown but treacherous scheme. Robin and Azeem arrive to find Robin's formerly luxurious abode of Locksley Castle destroyed and his father, murdered. Lord Locksley's loyal servant, Duncan, has survived, though his eyes were removed. With his lands and reputation gone Robin swears to avenge his father's murder. Robin then begins by seeking out, Maid Marian, the cousin of the king and his childhood friend. He is immediately attracted to Marian, although she does not return the feelings, which poses a problem because Nottingham also has his sights set on her. While Robin, Azeem and Duncan escape the revenge seeking Gisboune and his soldiers, they seek shelter in the Forest of Sherwood, where they come across Little John, and a large group of woodsmen, all of whom were outlawed through the tyranny of the Sheriff. After proving his skill in single combat, Robin is accepted into their group and eventually becomes their leader, though Will Scarlet, one of Robin's men, is constantly undermining his leadership. Robin encourages his men to fight back against Nottingham and begins to train them to defend themselves while they build weapons and homes in the forest, it's their time to take it back.If you haven't seen Robin Hood Prince of Thieves I highly recommend that you do, honestly I don't know why anyone would not enjoy this film just a little bit. Like I said, it has everything to make a film great. My favorite scene, hard to choose from so many, is the ending battle scene where they discover that Robin Hood is alive and he is there at the castle to save his beloved Marian, it's a great scene that keeps you on the edge of your seat. So please just get past the accents, give this movie a chance, it's a terrific story and a wonderful movie that I will still watch and probably will even more so as I grow older. Besides I have to just to see Alan Rickman threaten Robin Hood with a spoon, lol, greatest threat ever.10\/10 ","genre":"Action, Adventure, Drama"},{"date":"18 November 2003","score":"0 out of 11 people found the following review useful","review":"  Ok movie.

He now brings us Dracula Dead and Loving it, one of my favorite guilty pleasures. I know there is a bit of hate for this movie because a lot of people say that Mel lost his touch and this isn't as funny as his older films. Let's face it, Mel peeked pretty early in his career with Young Frankenstein, which is one of my favorite films of all time, but everyone is naturally going to compare every film that he made at that point with his greatest movies. But if you seriously are telling me that there was not one scene that you didn't laugh at then you need your funny bone checked.The year is 1893, solicitor Thomas Renfield travels all the way from London to Transylvania to meet an important client. As he nears the end of his journey, the sun sets, and the stagecoach driver refuses to take him any further. Kindly villagers plead with him to turn back, but Renfield explains that he is expected. Renfield arrives safely and meets Count Dracula, a charming but rather strange man who is, of course, a vampire. Dracula signs the papers finalizing the purchase of Carfax Abbey in England, and Renfield retires for the night. He wakes up when two Brides of Dracula come gliding seductively in. Dracula then casts a hypnotic spell on the suggestible Renfield, making him his slave. Dracula and Renfield soon embark for England. He goes ashore, leaving Renfield behind. When Renfield is discovered alone on the ship, he is confined to a lunatic asylum. Dracula introduces himself to his new neighbors Doctor Seward, owner of the asylum where Renfield is being held, and a believer in enemas as a sovereign remedy for mental illness; Seward's assistant, Jonathan Harker; Seward's beautiful daughter Mina; and Seward's ward, the equally pretty Lucy. Dracula flirts with Lucy and, later that night, he feeds on her blood. The next day, Mina discovers Lucy still in bed late in the morning, looking strangely pale. Seward, puzzled by the odd puncture marks on her throat, calls in an expert on obscure diseases, Dr. Abraham Van Helsing. Van Helsing is convinced that Dracula is a vampire and that they must destroy him before he gets to Mina next.Dracula Dead and Loving It may be a bit silly at times, but seriously, you can't help but laugh. It's certainly a lot better then most spoof movies today. How could you not love Leslie Nielson as Dracula? He was so hilarious, but who truly stole the show? Peter MacNicol as Reinfield, I can't tell you how hard he made me laugh, if one laugh supposedly makes you loose 3 calories, I think I lost 15,000 calories with just his scenes. Reinfield being seduced by Dracula's brides, him trying to save Dracula's coffin on the ship from hitting the walls back and forth, him sneaking under Lucy's bed sheets to peak at her, to the ending, actually every scene with him is non stop laughs.

Mike Myers comes up with a lot of creative characters and he hit the nail in the head with Wayne Campbell and Garth Algar. After the huge success of Wayne's World, it was pretty obvious that they could go for another round. Unfortunately Wayne's World 2 wasn't as big of a splash as the original, but it still made me laugh so hard. As stupid as it was and some of the jokes were a little recycled, I still had such a great time watching this movie. It's silly and over the top, but how could you not have fun with Wayne and Garth? This is a fun sequel that should be given a fair chance.Wayne and Garth are a year older and everything has stayed basically the same, except Wayne has moved out of his parents' house and lives with Garth in an abandoned factory loft in Chicago. Wayne has a dream where he meets Jim Morrison and a weird naked Indian, in which Morrison tells Wayne that his destiny is to organize and put on a big concert. Cassandra, meanwhile, spends a lot of time out of town where she is working with record producer Mr. Big on recording music. Her new producer, Bobby Cahn, slowly tries to seduce her away from Wayne. After Wayne admits that he was spying on her, Cassandra breaks off the relationship and hastily gets engaged to Bobby on the rebound. Garth meets a beautiful woman, Honey Hornee, at the laundromat, and she quickly ropes him in with her charms. Wayne and Garth re-enter Wayne's previous dream and meet Jim Morrison again. They decide to go for one more try and make Waynestock a success, get Cassandra back, and see if Garth can find real love since his new girl is kinda homicidal.Honestly if someone asked me if Wayne's World 2 is worth the watch, I'd definitely say yes. This is always guaranteed a good laugh, just Garth's story alone with Kim Bassinger as Honey Hornee is worth the look. I also love the scene where the guys end up in a gay bar and end up singing Y.M.C.A. song, I nearly died laughing. Also Christopher Walken is in this movie, what more do you need to watch a movie? Christopher was such a great addition to the characters and made a great villain. It was great to see all the characters back together and this was a fun sequel, so if you need a good laugh, don't hold back, this is a movie that is sure to tickle you're funny bone.7\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"18 November 2003","score":"14 out of 18 people found the following review useful","review":" In 1992 we were given the comedy classic, Wayne's World, it was stupid, immature, and silly, but it's what we needed for a great laugh.

Cassandra, meanwhile, spends a lot of time out of town where she is working with record producer Mr. Big on recording music. Her new producer, Bobby Cahn, slowly tries to seduce her away from Wayne. After Wayne admits that he was spying on her, Cassandra breaks off the relationship and hastily gets engaged to Bobby on the rebound. Garth meets a beautiful woman, Honey Hornee, at the laundromat, and she quickly ropes him in with her charms. Wayne and Garth re-enter Wayne's previous dream and meet Jim Morrison again. They decide to go for one more try and make Waynestock a success, get Cassandra back, and see if Garth can find real love since his new girl is kinda homicidal.Honestly if someone asked me if Wayne's World 2 is worth the watch, I'd definitely say yes. This is always guaranteed a good laugh, just Garth's story alone with Kim Bassinger as Honey Hornee is worth the look. I also love the scene where the guys end up in a gay bar and end up singing Y.M.C.A. song, I nearly died laughing. Also Christopher Walken is in this movie, what more do you need to watch a movie? Christopher was such a great addition to the characters and made a great villain. It was great to see all the characters back together and this was a fun sequel, so if you need a good laugh, don't hold back, this is a movie that is sure to tickle you're funny bone.7\/10 ","genre":"Comedy, Music"},{"date":"18 November 2003","score":"14 out of 18 people found the following review useful","review":" In 1992 we were given the comedy classic, Wayne's World, it was stupid, immature, and silly, but it's what we needed for a great laugh. Mike Myers comes up with a lot of creative characters and he hit the nail in the head with Wayne Campbell and Garth Algar. After the huge success of Wayne's World, it was pretty obvious that they could go for another round. Unfortunately Wayne's World 2 wasn't as big of a splash as the original, but it still made me laugh so hard. As stupid as it was and some of the jokes were a little recycled, I still had such a great time watching this movie. It's silly and over the top, but how could you not have fun with Wayne and Garth?
