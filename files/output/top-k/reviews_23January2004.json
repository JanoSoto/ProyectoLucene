Some critics have bashed the film, saying that it is nothing more than a special effects orgy riddled with cheesy scenes and cliches.  Although the film is crafted in the fashion of the summer blockbuster, it is impossible to deny that it was an important gain in the field of cinema as a whole. It is an enjoyable film with many suspenseful moments and helped pave the way for the further development of CGI in order to dazzle film audiences.I read the book after seeing the movie (I was about 10 years old at the time), and I couldn't help but feeling how the movie would have been so much cooler if they'd included some other scenes.  These include the aviary scene with the pterodactyls, the whole rafting journey, the raptor nest, and the eventual destruction of the island.  However, it is understandable that many of these scenes were cut out due to time and money constraints.  In most cases, the books hold more gold than the movie versions anyway and edited scenes are sometimes better left to the imagination.  Thus, the lack of consistency with the book has certainly not detracted from my view of this movie as a whole.The obvious strong point of the film is the groundbreaking work in computer effects.  This was the first time that computers were able to realistically portray animals in full sunlight and weather effects in a film.  The most striking aspect of this milestone is that the animals created are enormous.  Dinosaurs have always permeated the imaginations of countless people because of their gargantuan size and the mystery surrounding them.  We have all been reduced to seeing pictures of the dinosaurs as they might have looked millions of years ago, or seeing their fossilized remains in museums.  Jurassic Park was able to bring the huge beasts to life, created a strata of terror, gentleness, and above all sheer size.  The earth shakes under the weight of a 100 ton Brachiasaur coming down on all fours after feeding on a tree and as the Tyrannosaur chases down a jeep.The dinosaurs as character elements are equally amazing.  The Tyrannosaurus Rex is one polarity of terror, melding enormous size with speed and a deafening roar that makes a lion sound like a kitten.  On the other pole are the absolutely terrifying velociraptors.  They are small, but their high intelligence and ability to hunt with precision in a pack make them creatures of nightmares.  The hunting scene in which Lex and Tim are trapped in a kitchen with two raptors is very effective.  Perhaps equally as scary are the dilophasaurs small dinosaurs that appear playful at first, but become almost demonic, blinding prey with a paralyzing secretion that they spit.  The creators took a few liberties with the dinosaurs (velociraptors are actually smaller and dilophasaurs are 10 feet tall), but these are mere details that won't harm the experience of even a dinosaur nerd like myself.The emphasis stays with the dinosaurs and their ability to awe the audience, as it rightfully should.  There are some very good actors in this movie, which is interesting for a summer blockbuster.  Also, critics should be able to acknowledge that the acting is above average in this film.  To back this up, I point to the sequel The Lost World.  That movie had talented actors as well such as Julianne Moore, but the writing and acting was very sub par.  Sam Neill plays his part well, portraying a paleontologist who is both excited beyond his wildest imagination, and saddened by the fact that his profession will soon become obsolete.  Laura Dern plays a good counterpart to him, and Jeff Goldblum shines as the eccentric mathematician Ian Malcolm.Jurassic Park does contain many cliches.  The whole journey of Sam Neill towards becoming a father figure for the two children is somewhat heavy towards the end for example.  Also, the whole scene with the lawyer getting what he deserves by being bitten in half after cowering on a toilet is rather ridiculous.  However, the movie is filled with very memorable gags that remind the viewer that this movie was made to entertain. The T Rex nearly bites off the rearview mirror which reads objects in the mirror are closer than they appear and at the conclusion of the film, a banner that reads the when dinosaurs ruled the earth flutters down amidst his bellowing roar.  It is simple elements like that which provide an amusing feel to the film without having to rely heavily on spoken quips.In conclusion, Jurassic Park taught us that things of our imagination could be realistically portrayed on the screen in a way that can both dazzle and scare.

Legend has it that Dustin Hoffman sat in his dressing room prior to filming and screamed at the top of his lungs for an hour in order to gain the raspy voice of a 122-year-old man for the voice-over soundtrack of the film.I don't know if that's true or not, but regardless of the methods he may have used to gain his coarse voice, it works like a charm. Until the very end, I doubted whether it was even Hoffman doing the voice-over at all. And speaking of the ending, it is purely and simply one of the greatest ever made.The story is something that Hollywood likes to do a lot; only this time it's the best version. Having just watched The Last Samurai, I realized the similarities between both films -- a man is taken in by his potential enemies and treated as one of their own. Then, when faced with the possibility of war, he must choose which side to fight for. And, as I said in my review of The Last Samurai, both films similarly bash General Custer.In that movie, samurai warriors captured the hero. In Little Big Man, the hero is captured by Indians -- or, more correctly, saved. After being massacred in a sandy desert by the Indians, a young boy named Jack Crabb is kidnapped by one of them and the Indian brings him back to their camp.As a small child, Jack is raised as one of their own. As he grows older, the Human Beings affectionately name him Little Big Man. As anyone can guess, he doesn't fit in with the Indians, but the Chief of the Cherokees (Chief Dan George, who died 11 years after the film was made) takes a liking to Little Big Man. Jack refers to him as Grandfather, even up until the end of the film.Much to the chagrin of some Indians his own age, Jack begins to grow into an adult -- he looks a lot like Dustin Hoffman, too. When he hits adulthood, Jack leaves the Indians and heads out into civilization, where he meets Mrs. Louise Pendrake (Faye Dunaway) and his sister, Caroline (Carole Androsky), who fled from the safety of the Indians one night years before, leaving Jack by himself.Jack, as an adult, even joins General Custer and is present at the infamous Custer's Last Stand, where he has to choose whether or not to fight against his own kind or become a traitor to the Indians.In between we follow Jack's adventures as he tries to make a living a number of different ways -- by helping an old man sell fake medicine to townspeople, to going out into the wild to find his kidnapped wife. (He eventually ends up finding her years later, only to see her as a wife to one of the Indians. She doesn't even recognize him.)This is an amazing, beautiful movie, filmed and released at the height of Cowboy and Indian movies. The message isn't gooey and sentimental like it could have been handled -- it seems very real. We become so affectionate towards Jack's character that when small things happen to him we feel sad or happy, or even laugh at the small humorous quirks. (Such as the irony that Mrs. Pendrake becomes a prostitute after having preached to Jack years before about the importance of avoiding Satan's temptation.)The director, Arthur Penn, stands back and lets things play out in old fashion film-making style. No quick cuts or awkward camera angles during action sequences -- this feels like a real old-fashioned western movie, even though it was released in 1970, the decade when the westerns started to increasingly diminish.The political correctness of the film is easily overlooked. For once it seemed as though Indians were not portrayed as the type of tree-loving mythical warriors in such films as the terrible Pocahontas (Disney version). No, here we get a lot of Custer bashing, which probably had to do with the fact that the Vietnam War was going on at the time of release. Custer's attack on the Washita was perhaps intended to trigger thoughts of the Calley massacre at My Lai, the trial of which was going on the same year as the film.And I seriously doubt whether Custer was quite as crazy as Richard Mulligan portrays him in Little Big Man. Egotistical, yes, but I don't think he suddenly started calling people Mr. President at the Last Stand and tried to murder them.But the film is also a subtle satire of the west. Besides, the film will sweep your thoughts away into other terrain before you have time to get mad over some of the inaccuracies and stereotypes.Example? The acting is marvelous, and full credit goes to Dustin Hoffman, who carries this film from beginning to end. I don't usually think of Dustin Hoffman as one of the best actors ever made, but I think that's because he so often disappears into character. He rarely plays himself. In Tootsie he plays a woman, in Rain Man he plays a mentally challenged individual, and in Little Big Man he plays a sort of hybrid between an Indian and a cowboy. He doesn't know what he is, and his journey to find out is what holds us, as an audience, so interested in the story.My two votes for best westerns ever made would go to Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969) and Little Big Man (1970).

Jack refers to him as Grandfather, even up until the end of the film.Much to the chagrin of some Indians his own age, Jack begins to grow into an adult -- he looks a lot like Dustin Hoffman, too. When he hits adulthood, Jack leaves the Indians and heads out into civilization, where he meets Mrs. Louise Pendrake (Faye Dunaway) and his sister, Caroline (Carole Androsky), who fled from the safety of the Indians one night years before, leaving Jack by himself.Jack, as an adult, even joins General Custer and is present at the infamous Custer's Last Stand, where he has to choose whether or not to fight against his own kind or become a traitor to the Indians.In between we follow Jack's adventures as he tries to make a living a number of different ways -- by helping an old man sell fake medicine to townspeople, to going out into the wild to find his kidnapped wife. (He eventually ends up finding her years later, only to see her as a wife to one of the Indians. She doesn't even recognize him.)This is an amazing, beautiful movie, filmed and released at the height of Cowboy and Indian movies. The message isn't gooey and sentimental like it could have been handled -- it seems very real. We become so affectionate towards Jack's character that when small things happen to him we feel sad or happy, or even laugh at the small humorous quirks. (Such as the irony that Mrs. Pendrake becomes a prostitute after having preached to Jack years before about the importance of avoiding Satan's temptation.)The director, Arthur Penn, stands back and lets things play out in old fashion film-making style. No quick cuts or awkward camera angles during action sequences -- this feels like a real old-fashioned western movie, even though it was released in 1970, the decade when the westerns started to increasingly diminish.The political correctness of the film is easily overlooked. For once it seemed as though Indians were not portrayed as the type of tree-loving mythical warriors in such films as the terrible Pocahontas (Disney version). No, here we get a lot of Custer bashing, which probably had to do with the fact that the Vietnam War was going on at the time of release. Custer's attack on the Washita was perhaps intended to trigger thoughts of the Calley massacre at My Lai, the trial of which was going on the same year as the film.And I seriously doubt whether Custer was quite as crazy as Richard Mulligan portrays him in Little Big Man. Egotistical, yes, but I don't think he suddenly started calling people Mr. President at the Last Stand and tried to murder them.But the film is also a subtle satire of the west. Besides, the film will sweep your thoughts away into other terrain before you have time to get mad over some of the inaccuracies and stereotypes.Example? The acting is marvelous, and full credit goes to Dustin Hoffman, who carries this film from beginning to end. I don't usually think of Dustin Hoffman as one of the best actors ever made, but I think that's because he so often disappears into character. He rarely plays himself. In Tootsie he plays a woman, in Rain Man he plays a mentally challenged individual, and in Little Big Man he plays a sort of hybrid between an Indian and a cowboy. He doesn't know what he is, and his journey to find out is what holds us, as an audience, so interested in the story.My two votes for best westerns ever made would go to Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969) and Little Big Man (1970). Both films are very different. Both are very amazing.4.5\/5.

Set in a sort of Gotham meets Metropolis (the movie, not Superman's city) city in which there are many many subtle incongruencies which may not be noticed immediately by the average viewer. This movie demands a second viewing. The story is at the same time unique and yet grounded in certain staples of Sci-Fi and Noir. Although it opens with some cryptic background, it truly begins with a man waking up in a bathtub and realizing he has totally lost his memories. This provides a great clean slate on which to let the viewer experience his search for answers in this bizarre dark city. The script although confusing is well written with hundreds of little intricacies to be noticed on the second and subsequent viewings. The acting is on the whole quite good, Rufus Sewell pulls off the confused but slightly angry John very well, probably his best role in film. Jennifer Connelly (whom you may recognize from her Oscar winning performance as Alica Nash in A Beautiful Mind) plays John's sort of love interest, tackling the complex character of Emma and lending her real emotion, it's easy to see how great an actress she is, and indeed she finally won the laurels after this movie with a string of great performances. Keifer Sutherland manages a great creepy character, his sort of breathing problem at first may seem overacted but ends up adding a sort of pace to his scenes, an urgency if you will. Richard O'Brien is just straight up frightening, honestly I don't think they did enough with his character, he could have been so much more menacing than they ended up using him for.Overall this film is an EXCELLENT one for any fan of sci-fi, noir, or really anyone who likes a great underrecognized film. I made it through without comparing it to the Matrix so far, but I have to say something first off, it came out BEFORE, so none of that matrix copy crap, and no I'm not saying the matrix copied IT, the movies have too much dissimilarity (especially in quality, Dark City is sooo much better than the Matrix) to throw around accusations of imitation.When was the last time you remember doing something during the day?

The first is a comedy buddy movie between Pitt and Norton that takes about the first half of the movie. Intertwined into this is a psycho love story between Norton and Carter, taking about the same parts. Project Mayhem is where the horror\/thriller begins, along the lines of Invasion of the Body Snatchers.Part of what makes this movie unique is the juxtaposition of three non-cliched cliche storylines. It's a sick, twisted buddy movie. It's a sick, twisted love story. It's a tame horror\/thriller (where other than Meat Loaf's head-bullet and Norton's neck wound, nobody gets seriously hurt.)I love you....Sir.What makes it work is the comedy. The funny parts make the ludicrous parts more realistic and bring a very unusual level of reality to the actors and the situations. Dark comedy or black comedy is most often used to describe this film, although few dark comedies reach the levels of hilarity this film does.To avoid spoilers, let's say that for most people, the first viewing is nowhere nearly as rewarding as the 2nd, 3rd, or 40th viewing. And then, once you think you've figured it all out, you discover even more hidden caveats in the DVD commentaries.One tidbit at the end of the actor's commentary is that Norton approached Pitt and they talked about making movies that stand the test of time. While some movies still in print are still in print for mysterious and unknown reasons, in literature, classic books are those that contain universal themes, often while reflecting culture and society of the time.Fight Club definitely has a lot of philosophy, a lot more than say The Matrix. A short list Fathers, fatherhood and a father's responsibility the existence, real or imagined, of God the Feminization of men Anger vs. aggression friendship, relationships, and love mental and spiritual strength vs physicalHowever, the philosophy here has not reached the mass appeal of say Yoda-isms from The Empire Strikes Back nor The Matrix, probably because of realistic context, homeoerotic overtones, or general weirdity. But, are they universal? Definitely. Does it reflect the culture of the day? Of course.The 4th rule of movie reviews make up your own words like 'weirdity.'So, should you watch Fight Club? There's a 50\/50 chance to either really love it or really hate it after the first viewing. If you already hate it, maybe it's time to watch it again. There's a level of maturity that is required to really enjoy it and get past the repulsive surface features, frat boy mentality, and toilet humor.You haven't watched a movie this f*cked since grade school.

Project Mayhem is where the horror\/thriller begins, along the lines of Invasion of the Body Snatchers.Part of what makes this movie unique is the juxtaposition of three non-cliched cliche storylines. It's a sick, twisted buddy movie. It's a sick, twisted love story. It's a tame horror\/thriller (where other than Meat Loaf's head-bullet and Norton's neck wound, nobody gets seriously hurt.)I love you....Sir.What makes it work is the comedy. The funny parts make the ludicrous parts more realistic and bring a very unusual level of reality to the actors and the situations. Dark comedy or black comedy is most often used to describe this film, although few dark comedies reach the levels of hilarity this film does.To avoid spoilers, let's say that for most people, the first viewing is nowhere nearly as rewarding as the 2nd, 3rd, or 40th viewing. And then, once you think you've figured it all out, you discover even more hidden caveats in the DVD commentaries.One tidbit at the end of the actor's commentary is that Norton approached Pitt and they talked about making movies that stand the test of time.

There's a 50\/50 chance to either really love it or really hate it after the first viewing. If you already hate it, maybe it's time to watch it again.

The character is fascinating because he can be looked at from so many different angles. Is Travis really just a passive man who is influenced by other people's opinions, and how far is he willing to go to please others? DeNiro brilliantly captures this idea and is always questioning the audience where Travis is a needlessly violent man or a lost, lonely one.--That twist...My God, it just surprised the crap out of me. It completely surprised me, and made a whole lot of sense while doing it (I'm talking about the twist at the end of the film of course). Scorsese's storytelling twists are always marvellous, this is probably his best plot turn yet.--As Travis gets the job as a taxi driver, we follow him through his misadventures of New York city life, and I found it really intriguing to see how well Scorsese captured the nightlife of this city. The atmosphere was always there, and seeing the happenings on the mean streets from so many perspectives was fascinating.--I loved the score for this movie. It really involved me. The music was wonderfully conducted, sometimes shocking and at others delightfully moving.--How can I do a review of Taxi Driver without mentioning that classic 'you talkin' to me?' scene?! I love that scene! It's just got that unforgettable classic feel to it, and is very realistic - who wouldn't be like that if they had those kickass guns and neat-o accent?--The film does drag slightly in the second half (mentioned below), but once Jodie Foster's character comes into the mix, the movie becomes instantly more involving. Her inclusion allows for us to see Travis' interactions with others, it shows how he communicates with others. Foster's performance is also very entertaining, she's excellent and effective...especially at this young age, it's quite an achievement.THE BAD--The middle part of the film shows Travis not doing all that much, some scenes drag slightly and aren't all that interesting.RATING9\/10 - There's no denying Scorsese's focus or DeNiro's amazing characteristics, and there's also no denying that Taxi Driver is a deservedly well-respected classic.IF YOU LIKED THIS MOVIE I RECCOMENDAmerican Psycho (7\/10) Bringing Out the Dead (9\/10) Fight Club (10\/10) Gangs of New York (10\/10) Raging Bull (8\/10) ","genre":null},{"date":"23 January 2004","score":"","review":"  TAXI DRIVER (1976)THE GOOD--Robert DeNiro's performance as Travis Bickle is purely unforgettable - this is the role for which he will be remembered (though there are a bunch, let's not forget Jake LaMotta in Raging Bull).

Foster's performance is also very entertaining, she's excellent and effective...especially at this young age, it's quite an achievement.THE BAD--The middle part of the film shows Travis not doing all that much, some scenes drag slightly and aren't all that interesting.RATING9\/10 - There's no denying Scorsese's focus or DeNiro's amazing characteristics, and there's also no denying that Taxi Driver is a deservedly well-respected classic.IF YOU LIKED THIS MOVIE I RECCOMENDAmerican Psycho (7\/10) Bringing Out the Dead (9\/10) Fight Club (10\/10) Gangs of New York (10\/10) Raging Bull (8\/10) ","genre":"Crime, Drama"},{"date":"23 January 2004","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":"  This is probably one of my favorite movies of all time.
