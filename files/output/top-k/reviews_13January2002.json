Science fiction aficionadosshould take note that, unlike the original PLANET OF THE APES,this non-remake makes no effort to lay any kind of logicalconnection between the different time frames alluded to in the plot.If you have ever seen any time travel films before, even mediocreones, you will have come to expect some logical inconsistencies(reflecting that time travel is theoretically impossible in the firstplace), but Burton seems intent on simply giving the finger to anysemblance of logic here. If you haven't seen the film yet, you haveprobably been told to expect a surprise ending; I would tell you toexpect a surprisingly stupid ending that is surprisingly insulting tothe audience's intelligence.Burton's fondness for dark sets is apparent here,  but instead ofthe decadent, wildly overgrown urban landscape of his GothamCity,  all you get here is sensory deprivation and an urge to nod offduring one of the film's frequent and lengthy periods of inactivity.The ape makeup, which was groundbreaking at the time of theoriginal film, has not really improved much. Some of it is quitegood (Tim Roth as Thade), but it is otherwise uneven, as is theacting.Burton makes much of the difference in strength and agilitybetween apes and humans, but the way he shows this is not byendowing the apes with natural animal-like grace, but by loadingthem onto hidden catapults and launching them into the scene.

Scorsese's directing is on top just as are Deniro's and Liotta's performances.  Joe Pesci plays the perfect psycopath and Deniro as usual gives a great performance as  he does in every other Scorsese film.   New generation, old tradition, that's exactly what this movie is all about.   In the old tradition a wise guy would never kill a made guy, in the new tradition, a wise guy does kill a made guy but he can't get away with it.Does the Godfather deserve to be in the same category as Goodfellas?  I say Yes.  There are three reason's why I think this is true.  1. The directing in both movies captures the reality of mob life and how their lives end.  2. The acting in both movies is superlative 3. The two movies depict the same subject but with  different stories. I have to admit I think Goodfellas is much better than Godfather because the murder scenes in  The Godfather are too stylish and too made up. Goodfellas on the other hand is based on a true story and the violent scenes look real and you get that feel of reality in those scenes because it really did happen.   I'm not about to say Martin Scorsese is a better director than Coppola, but I feel that Scorsese's film Goodfellas has more emotion than Coppola's film Godfather.   Remember that scene in Goodfellas when Deniro, Liotta, and Pesci are beating the life out of that made guy in the bar and you hear the music getting louder? That's what Scorsese does with his films. He uses music to enhance emotion in his movie's.   Coppola does not do that, no music, no feeling, just a scene and a person.  Some people may not like the ending of Goodfellas.  To tell you the truth, I didn't like the ending at first, but I saw it five more times and I like it now. I know the ending doesn't give us a reason not to be a gangster, but Scorsese didn't want this film to have a sad ending like Blow.

All the so called horror movies have had basicly no story, and bad teenage caracters who really suck at acting. OK, watching one or two of them might be ok but after a while they are all the same. So as I walked around the video store I looked at movie after movie but there was nothing that really appealed to me. But then on the top shelf there was Sleepy Hollow, it looked different from all the other horror movies so i hired it. That Day I sat doun to watch it and it keept me intrigued the whole movie. Even though it probley wasnt the most realistic movie, I didnt laugh or comment onece that there was somthing stupid or unrealistic about this movie. Thats because the movie was so wel l made that it made you belive that there could be a headless horseman for that houre and a half when you watch this movieWell any way the movie starts of when Constable Ichabod Crane (Johnny Depp) is sent to Sleepy hollow to investigate three murders that have occurred over the last fortnight all three victoms were decapitated. When he gets there more people get decapitated and the people in the toun belive it is the headless horseman. But Constable Ichabod Crane dose not belive them untill he sees the horseman with his own eyes. Now with the help of Katrina Anne Van Tassel (Christina Ricci) and Young Masbath (Marc Pickering) he must find out who controls the headless horseman and in what significant order the horsman is killing in!You may ask me why I think this is the best horror movie ever, well because it has a great story line, its got great actors and its the most intriguing horror movie I have seen. Overall I'll give it 10\/10!

The story is supposed to be about how a man reclaims his life and finds himself, but by the end of the movie, you wonder if that really happened and you don't care anyway.

How does that justify a murder? And how does anyone know what really happened? The wife could have been lying because she was tired of living with him. The one time we meet her she's drunk, bitter, and berating HIM. Oh WHATEVER! (MORE SPOILERS) The trashing of the one fellow's boat and home by his friends left me scratching my head in puzzlement as to why.

Polanski is a genius at making his characters so much larger than life, almost caricatures of real people. I think that he does this by choosing just the right costumes and accessories (in Corso's case it was the satchel, the glasses and the woolen tie), and then filming the characters up close so that they seem to fill up the whole screen. This gives a very personal feel to the movie.A number of reviewers have commented on the lack on an ending, or the lack of explanations to many questions. I found the ending to make sense, and I found no unanswered questions. As another reviewer pointed out that Polanski admitted he didn't have a real ending for the film, perhaps my understanding of the ending has nothing to do with what Polanski had in mind.Towards the end of the film, Balkan solves the enigma of the Nine Gates by reuniting all of the Lucifer engravings, and reads the riddle to himself (and a watching Corso). The riddle (as far as I would make out) is `To travel in silence; by a long a secretous (confusing?) path; to brave the arrows of misfortune; and fear neither noose nor fire; to play the greatest game and win; foregoing all expense; is to make a (something?) of faith; and gain at last the key; that will unlock the ninth gate.'If you watch the film closely, you will find that Corso does indeed, albeit unknowingly, follow the instructions in the riddle. He travels discretely; the path certainly is confusing; he had many misfortunes, but persists; when confronted with his dead friend (on the noose), and in several places fire, he is not afraid; he certainly played the game of looking for (and getting) the engravings; he spared no expense, notice the bribes and tips that he passes around; and at the Baroness's library he proclaimed his failing faith.Perhaps Balkan had also done similar deeds, but since the last engraving was a forgery, and gave the wrong instructions, he failed to open the Gate.Who made the forgery? Obviously the Ceniza brothers. When Corso met them, they showed ample knowledge of what was required to forge a book like the Nine Gates. Their solution was to forge only a single sheet in the book. Being specialists in antique bookbinding, they could very well have replaced the page. You can make up your own mind why they did it. Was it because they knew the power of the book and wanted to make sure that anybody who tried to open the Gate would fail, or were they agents of Lucifer who wanted to be able to choose whom (s)he allowed to access the Gate?What was behind the Ninth Gate?

Who actually saw him at the murder scenes? In New York it was the taxi driver who would probably not find out about the murder anyway. In Portugal, Fargas lived by himself and probably didn't tell anyone that Corso was visiting him. In France there were two witnesses, but they only caught a glimpse of Corso fleeing the scene, and even if they did recognize him, the police still had to find him, and he skipped town pretty soon after.All in all, I think that there are answers for just about any questions you could ask about the film.

While I absolutely loved The Matrix and Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon - the violence in those films was - well, just not as stupidly splatteringly relentlessly in-your-face.  While this film had some stunning shots and cinematic techniques they did not make the movie watchable.   I am concerned because it looked to me like the wolves in the wolf slaughter scene were real and could have been injured.  There was no Humane Society disclaimer at the end and if they indeed used trip wires (which is what it looks like) to get some of those shots, the movie should be banned in all civilized countries.  And even if that is not the case, the movie should be better promoted and labeled. I am very disappointed that not one reviewer mentioned how totally over the top the gore was.  While it is clear (and disturbing) that there is an audience for this, some of us would have liked to avoid it. This is NOT Bruce Lee!!  It is gore, gore, gore and just stupid.  The fight scenes were pale rip-offs of scenes in way better movies.  Slow, dull, unwatchable.
