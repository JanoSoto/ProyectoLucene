Through watching various anime and reading graphic novels, I've come to the conclusion that the Japanese, at least partially, may view the afterlife as determined by the individual.

Something remarkable about the film is that it doesn't distinguish its characters by developing them, but with the unique nature of the memories they have. Furthermore, their memories are realistic and touching. Some people wish to cherish the memory of a lover; while others (especially those who were young when they died) choose a memory of childhood.

What I loved about my version was how it looked like old TV reruns from the 70's faded, scratchy, well-worn...and dirty. I'm sure the new widescreen, digitally remastered version looks sparkling by comparison, but who wants to watch a gritty film with all the grit buffed out? I want my Dirty Harry filthy.The movie itself is pretty much what you'd expect if you've never seen it or (like me) haven't watched it in a very long time. The crooks are scumbags, the bureaucrats are pussies and the law is the blast shield these weasels all hide behind. Enter Harry Callahan (Clint Eastwood) and his best (and only) friend Mr. 44 Magnum (Smith & Wesson). When Harry is finished, this same blast shield resembles a splintered, bloodied and hollowed out exit wound to the back of a human skull. Early on, Harry, gun extended, asks a wounded bank robber I know what you're thinking. Did he fire six shots or only five? Well, to tell you the truth, in all this excitement I kind of lost track myself. But being as this is a .44 Magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world, and would blow your head clean off, you've got to ask yourself one question Do I feel lucky? Well, do ya, punk? Immortal words. As far as characters go, there's not a lot of depth to Harry. We get the hint his wife has been killed and that no one on the police force really likes him, they simply fear him. Harry is ice cold, trigger happy, racist, misanthropic, cynical and is incapable of spelling due process, let alone defining it. In other words, this guy embodies the typical American in the early 1970's, a collective soured by the senseless carnage of the Vietnam War. In fact, Harry is a right winger's wet dream where the crooks are corpses long before they get a chance to beg for habeas corpus. I suppose in many ways, Harry embodies what the typical right-wing American wishes they could have done to the Viet Cong blow em' away and put an end to this mess. But sadly, this is a movie and, wish fulfillment aside, things in the USA would get far worse (mounting Vietnam casualties and Watergate) before they would get better. In the end, Harry's six gun justice leaves him as disillusioned at the end as he was at the beginning and aside from some blood lust being served, the audience has to ask the same questions they must have been asking about the Vietnam War Why?What is refreshing about watching a movie like DH today is its disdain for political correctness and its balls out ability to show society as a cesspool in need of a good scrubbing. They don't make movies like this anymore and I'm shocked they don't considering how easily the Neo-Cons have made Watergate seem like a petty political prank and how Iraq is fast becoming our generation's Vietnam. The truth is, we could use a revamped and retooled version of Dirty Harry. Maybe this time around he could be a blood thirsty Secret Service Agent who snaps and goes on a rampage in the oval office.

It should be a space zone. It should be akin to this future world devoid of human organisms. A world in which nature is completely controlled. The formal severity of a film like 2001, the immaculateness, the restrained camera, which is in fact used in a lot of Kubricks films, really inspired me visually. - Todd HaynesThough similar in tone to Antonioni's Red Desert and Kubrick's 2001 A Space Odyssey, Todd Haynes' Safe remains one of the most unique and interesting films of the 90s.Carol White (Julianne Moore) is a wealthy housewife who lives in suburban Los Angeles. She has a rigid and ordered live, in which all her basic needs are catered for. But gradually Carol begins to develop Multiple Chemical Sensitivity, and literally becomes allergic to her surroundings. Whether this illness is biological or psychological is left ambiguous.Carol turns to various doctors for help, but they're unable to cure her. It's just a neurotic episode, they say. It will pass. But it doesn't. In frustration, Carol turns to a New Age cult who operate a healing camp out in the wilderness. Cutting herself off from the world, we watch as Carol's sphere gradually grows smaller and smaller. In the end, Carol finds herself all alone in a white domed tent, staring at herself in a mirror. Her allergies cease only when she finds total alienation.Though titled Safe, this disturbing and powerful film is anything but. At once intimate in its depiction of a woman losing control and apocalyptic in its scope, Safe plays out like a roadmap of End-days paranoia (minus the politics).Carol is essentially an unfulfilled housewife in an uncaring world. She wants to get away, to escape the triviality of late-capitalism, and so her subconscious creates phobias and allergies, her body reacting to its environment. Get me out of here, it says.The first act of the film shows Carol surrounded by nauseatingly normal and dangerously apathetic, well-to-do people. Indeed, until the onset of her illness, Julie herself is nauseatingly normal. It's to Haynes' credit that, after having so skillfully established his lead character as the epitome of bourgeois WASP elitism, he still manages to make us feel for her.But the films turns horrific in the second act, as Carol becomes hypersensitive to the chemicals in her everyday world. This triggers frightening and intense allergic reactions. Watching Moore in these reaction scenes is riveting. The film combines a Kubrickian sense of menace with a spooky level of detachment.Eventually Carol decides to take matters into her own hands, and, for the rest of the film, we follow her down a strange road of discovery in the traditional self-help fashion which, terrifyingly, leads nowhere. Her last hope is Wrenwood, an isolation camp run by a cult leader. But Wrenwood is as flawed in its own way as are the doctors of the outside world. Wrenwood offers encouragement, support and singalongs, but precious little else. The cult leader pretty much defines the attitudes of the patients at the camp when he confesses that he's stopped reading the newspapers and watching television.Like the proverbial ostrich, the patients at Wrenwood have their heads in the sand because, ultimately, it is not only the chemicals of the outside world that effect them, but the entire postmodern experience. These are victims of the Twentieth Century, Haynes says. Even isolated from the crime, stray bullets and flaming riots of the inner city, this well-to-do and insulated woman is still unsafe.The film also resonates nicely with Kubrick's The Shining. While the Shining portrays the stifling nature of the family unit in an increasingly individualistic and alienated human context, Safe examines the terrors of being an individual outside of a family context. Kubrick says there is something about the traditional family that is doomed to unravel. Haynes says that, without some kind of spiritual\/blood connection to a family of some sort, we as individuals are flawed and doomed to unravel.The Shining examines the breakdown of the nuclear family and the destructive power of the obsolete and meaningless roles in which that unit forces us to conform. Conversely, Safe examines the problems of individuals in societal free-fall, with no inbred moral tether, no real family support. At the end of Carol's journey, in a cold, white bubble that is an exterior reflection of her own barren soul, we begin to suspect the terrible truth that there is no cure for her kind of sickness. She has, consciously or not, abandoned humanity. Therefore her humanity has abandoned her. Belong or die. Thus, the film ends with Carol totally and utterly alone. I haven't seen as frightening a final image in a recent film as the sight of a weathered Julie, staring at herself in the mirror, telling herself unconvincingly I love you...I love you.Alone, she has only herself. In an apathetic world, only her love for herself is real. Or perhaps it's just another fragile attempt to mask self hate.9\/10 - This is arguably Todd Haynes' greatest film. While Haynes has a university masters in semiotics, Kubrick was a student of semiotics professor Umberto Eco. Both directors seem to approach film in the same way, depicting the world through signs and formal structures. Strangely, the rest of Haynes' filmography seems to have degenerated into silly postmodern pastiche.

She wants to get away, to escape the triviality of late-capitalism, and so her subconscious creates phobias and allergies, her body reacting to its environment. Get me out of here, it says.The first act of the film shows Carol surrounded by nauseatingly normal and dangerously apathetic, well-to-do people. Indeed, until the onset of her illness, Julie herself is nauseatingly normal. It's to Haynes' credit that, after having so skillfully established his lead character as the epitome of bourgeois WASP elitism, he still manages to make us feel for her.But the films turns horrific in the second act, as Carol becomes hypersensitive to the chemicals in her everyday world. This triggers frightening and intense allergic reactions. Watching Moore in these reaction scenes is riveting. The film combines a Kubrickian sense of menace with a spooky level of detachment.Eventually Carol decides to take matters into her own hands, and, for the rest of the film, we follow her down a strange road of discovery in the traditional self-help fashion which, terrifyingly, leads nowhere. Her last hope is Wrenwood, an isolation camp run by a cult leader. But Wrenwood is as flawed in its own way as are the doctors of the outside world. Wrenwood offers encouragement, support and singalongs, but precious little else. The cult leader pretty much defines the attitudes of the patients at the camp when he confesses that he's stopped reading the newspapers and watching television.Like the proverbial ostrich, the patients at Wrenwood have their heads in the sand because, ultimately, it is not only the chemicals of the outside world that effect them, but the entire postmodern experience. These are victims of the Twentieth Century, Haynes says. Even isolated from the crime, stray bullets and flaming riots of the inner city, this well-to-do and insulated woman is still unsafe.The film also resonates nicely with Kubrick's The Shining. While the Shining portrays the stifling nature of the family unit in an increasingly individualistic and alienated human context, Safe examines the terrors of being an individual outside of a family context. Kubrick says there is something about the traditional family that is doomed to unravel. Haynes says that, without some kind of spiritual\/blood connection to a family of some sort, we as individuals are flawed and doomed to unravel.The Shining examines the breakdown of the nuclear family and the destructive power of the obsolete and meaningless roles in which that unit forces us to conform. Conversely, Safe examines the problems of individuals in societal free-fall, with no inbred moral tether, no real family support. At the end of Carol's journey, in a cold, white bubble that is an exterior reflection of her own barren soul, we begin to suspect the terrible truth that there is no cure for her kind of sickness. She has, consciously or not, abandoned humanity. Therefore her humanity has abandoned her. Belong or die. Thus, the film ends with Carol totally and utterly alone. I haven't seen as frightening a final image in a recent film as the sight of a weathered Julie, staring at herself in the mirror, telling herself unconvincingly I love you...I love you.Alone, she has only herself. In an apathetic world, only her love for herself is real. Or perhaps it's just another fragile attempt to mask self hate.9\/10 - This is arguably Todd Haynes' greatest film. While Haynes has a university masters in semiotics, Kubrick was a student of semiotics professor Umberto Eco. Both directors seem to approach film in the same way, depicting the world through signs and formal structures. Strangely, the rest of Haynes' filmography seems to have degenerated into silly postmodern pastiche.

It should be a space zone. It should be akin to this future world devoid of human organisms. A world in which nature is completely controlled. The formal severity of a film like 2001, the immaculateness, the restrained camera, which is in fact used in a lot of Kubricks films, really inspired me visually. - Todd HaynesThough similar in tone to Antonioni's Red Desert and Kubrick's 2001 A Space Odyssey, Todd Haynes' Safe remains one of the most unique and interesting films of the 90s.Carol White (Julianne Moore) is a wealthy housewife who lives in suburban Los Angeles. She has a rigid and ordered live, in which all her basic needs are catered for. But gradually Carol begins to develop Multiple Chemical Sensitivity, and literally becomes allergic to her surroundings. Whether this illness is biological or psychological is left ambiguous.Carol turns to various doctors for help, but they're unable to cure her. It's just a neurotic episode, they say. It will pass. But it doesn't. In frustration, Carol turns to a New Age cult who operate a healing camp out in the wilderness. Cutting herself off from the world, we watch as Carol's sphere gradually grows smaller and smaller. In the end, Carol finds herself all alone in a white domed tent, staring at herself in a mirror. Her allergies cease only when she finds total alienation.Though titled Safe, this disturbing and powerful film is anything but.

I love the medium just as much as I love movies, but when a couple of people up at Hollywood decided to merge the mediums together, 9 times out of 10 the merge turns out to be a waste of time and money. Your money, that is. This movie is nothing more than a cheap cash-in on a great series of games. It is a huge disappointment on a vast array of levels.The only area this movie prevails in is it's action, but even that area is in really rough shape. The action is violent, gory, and devoid of all intelligence. The action ranges from some neat zombie vs. human confrontations, such as being the human's being trapped in a sewer and zombies are approaching from all possible sides, but at other times there are some real stupid sequence taking place (Kung-Fu lady vs. Zombie Dogs!) that are really embarrassing. Plus, the action gets really stupid when the CG starts to kick in, given that the CG looks dated compared to today's modern video games. No joke.All other areas in the film really suck. The story is bogus, disjointed, and incoherent. The acting is bad (probably intentional, given the voice acting in the games is bad as well), and the production values are not as high as they should have been. To top it all off, you get Paul W. S.

His stupid one-liners, dumb cinematography, bad editing, and pitiful script should be the prime examples in this country's film schools on how NOT to make a movie.To be honest, I had a little fun with this dumb movie. With all the absurdities and such, I just decided to make a joke out of the movie and not take anything serious at all.

Nineteen Eighty-Four the film almost completely ignores this final chapter. The Bookdoes far more to explain the aftermath of winstons treatment, and this is crucial to our understanding. Granted, the Books end can be perceived very different between individuals. I personally found it redeeming and hopeful of the future. The party meant to stamp the emotion, cognitive ability, and love right out of winston. Instead, they taught him how to really love, think about the world around him, and feel good natured emotion. To become a better man. The Ministry of Love had created in all their efforts exactly what they were trying to destroy. The party was fallible. It might fall, but Winston felt great gratitude towards Big Brother for teaching him these things. Winston loved Big Brother for it. Not in the way the party intended, but would he rise up against them? I do not know. The film did little to express the ideas of this chapter, and I would have had no way of formulating this idea of the novels conclusion based on it. I do not believe any viewer could come to an accurate conclusion of their personal theories of the novels final chapter based on the film. Some changes may always be necessary, even if just for keeping the running length below 3 hours, but this final chapter IMO needed to be shot word for word, scene for scene, in order, with every action meticulously displayed. The film even leaves out the crucial 'I betrayed you' comments by Winston and Julia to each other.Many other small situational contexts were changed throughout, such as the timing of events, and characters involved. George Orwell set out events in the Book in a particular order for a reason. The changing of the timing of these events blurs the ideas a little, but not to the point of serious detriment. The film does however, botch up dealing with the Brotherhood. Little mention is ever made in the film about the Brotherhood. It was my interpretation that the Brotherhood was organized and controlled by the party. An ultimate form of control. Consider the line in the book referring that the party makes the revolution to establish the dictatorship. None of this was touched upon in the film. Winston does not bring Julia to see O' Brian, and the conversation between the three does not take place in the context of the Book. In fact, a viewer who has not read the Book may not even grasp that O' Brian is claiming to be part of the Brotherhood at all.There are numerous other little changes I will not touch on. These two are the most important, and most detrimental to a film that is among the greatest ever made in the fields of acting and cinematography\/directing. The scenes involving a crowd watching the telescreen are classics of cinema.So my verdict? Do not see this movie if you have not read the book. You will not get an accurate representation of the most important concepts with which to formulate an understanding of the material. Even Winstons time in the Ministry of Love is portrayed on a level minimal to the length of coverage given in the book.

There hasn't been a murder in Washington state for over six years & the program has a 100% success record. Chief John Anderton (Tom Cruise) runs the PreCrime unit but is shocked when the PreCogs predict he will kill a man named Leon Crow in less than a day, a man Anderton has never even met. The PreCogs have never been wrong so Anderton goes on the run in an attempt to discover who set him up, why, how & change his future...Directed by Steven Spielberg & based on a short story by sci-fi author Philip K. Dick this dark & gritty big budget sci-fi action film can be considered amongst Spielberg's best, definitely not Spielberg's very best but not too far off it. The script by Jon Cohen & Scott Frank isn't typical Spielberg, there is a real edge to it with the leading hero a drug addict, a subplot involving child abduction & a vision of the not too distant future where murder can be predicted & those deemed responsible are put away for life without actually doing anything. The film makes the point that the future isn't set, that we choose our own destiny's & there's a strong anti technology message too.

The violence is fairly low, there are some fights & shoot-outs plus a couple of surgically removed eyeballs in a plastic bag.With a budget exceeding $100,000,000 Minority Report looks fabulous as one would hope & expect, Spielberg know's how to turn in a great film & it show's here in an almost perfectly judged sci-fi action thriller that actually makes you think. The CGI computer effects are superb & some of the best out there, they actually add to the story as well as the look & the feel of the film. The acting is good, Cruise puts in a good performance (although I am not sure he was worth his reported $25,000,000+ salary) as does veteran actor Max von Sydow.Minority Report is an excellent sci-fi thriller with plenty of spectacular action & a very absorbing & fairly intelligent script, add all that to a little Steven Spielberg magic & you have a great film. My only real problem with it is the length & once you have seen it & know the twists I am not sure how much replay value it has, I doubt I will want to see it again anytime soon.

The first Evil Dead was funny in a morbid way. It had some very dark humor, and was more of a horror film than a comedy. This movie has many horror elements to it, including several jump scenes and a very creepy atmosphere, but this a comedy. People who take this as a horror movie will probably be disappointed, but most people it seems in the first few minutes will figure out that this is meant to be funny, not scary.To (sort of) retell what happened in the first film, the first 10 minutes of the film show a different but similar story as the first movie, including leaving off exactly where that one did. Ash (Bruce Campbell) is stuck in the woods in a cabin haunted with Deadite demons that possessed his girlfriend and caused him to dispose of her. The demons are brought to life through a professor's recording of the Book of the Dead, and the professor's and a few others end up in the cabin with Ash. Blood, guts and hilarity ensues.Some say this is a remake of the original, and it's not, though it is similar to the first. Both take place in the cabin, though this one obviously takes place right after the first. Where most sequels pale in comparison to the originals, this one was even better than the first. The special effects were amazing. The over the top direction and acting were hilarious, including one scene where a moose head in the cabin begins to laugh and it's obviously infectious because soon the whole cabin including Ash in uproariously laughing. Weird and funny creatures are around every corner, as are the one liners from Bruce Campbell that go with them. There's little plot, but that's a good thing here so we get to see more creatures. One problem in this is the ending. It's a great, though bizarre cliffhanger, so make sure to have a copy of Army of Darkness to pop in right after to pick up where this leaves off.Overall, this is a hilarious, sort of scary comedy\/horror film that takes from many genres making it an extremely fresh film. It's probably the best of the Evil Dead trilogy.My rating *** 1\/2 out of ****. 80 mins. R for violence.

For that, you'll have to credit an eclectic casting decision matching Dean Martin as a drunken deputy with the Duke himself, and nineteen year old teenage heartthrob Ricky Nelson as a sharp shooting gunslinger who throws in with the good guys. Round it out with Walter Brennan's finely tuned stereotypical turn as a real McCoy deputy sheriff and you've got the ingredients for an entertaining Western. And oh yes, I don't want to forget Angie Dickinson as the romantic interest for Sheriff John T. Chance (John Wayne), but at twenty eight, she didn't look like the kind of girl who'd go for the fifty two year old Duke, looking more like ten years older. I think if you play the picture in your head without her, you'd still have a decent outcome, even if someone else had to throw the flowerpot.Say, could you have picked two better Western character actors than Claude Akins and Myron Healey to challenge the Dude (Dean Martin) with the old coin in the spittoon trick? You know, they weren't on screen very long, but if you follow the genre as a fan, it's always a kick to pick out the players in even the most minor roles. Then there's John Russell, someone I'll always remember first as the Lawman, but for some weird reason, I think I like him better as a villain. Trouble is, his screen time here wasn't nearly long enough to establish a sinister presence like the role of regulator Stockburn in Clint Eastwood's Pale Rider a couple of decades later. Still, I'll take him in a heartbeat if it means facing down the guys in white hats.The only thing that really catches you off guard in the story is when the good guys are holed up at the jail, and Dino breaks into song accompanied by Rick Nelson on guitar. Roy Rogers used to do that a lot too, even when he was behind bars! It's a nice diversion even if not very believable, especially when Stumpy (Brennan) knows the words to the song too! I guess what makes the picture work above all is the way Chance stays behind his guys through thick and thin, even when it looks like he's throwing them over. Especially effective are the scenes with Stumpy, played for comic effect, but always with some introspection and wise advice laid in between the lines. On the surface, it's not the kind of team you'd select if you were choosing sides for a pick up game, but when the dust settles, it's the one you'll have the most fun with and still win the contest.

I was instantly intrigued, I mean, a movie with George Lucas's name attached called Howard THE DUCK??? I just had to see it. Before I put it on I have had a glance at the IMDb boards and found that this was a very expensive film that bombed miserably at the box office and has been panned to death by critics and buffs alike. Why???I just finished watching it and I thought it was great, no masterpiece by any means but it gave out exactly what it promised. For all you people who hate this movie, you didn't really expect Gone with the wind or The sound of music from a film about a talking alien duck did you?Sure it was cheesy as hell, and some of the jokes were just terrible but the charm it oozes comes at you in bucket loads. The movie is over 20 years old and yet some of the special effects are better than in some of the dross out nowadays, and are definitely better than most movies out in the 80's. The humour is hit and miss at times but I thought it far funnier than anything the likes of Adam Sandler has done to date. The big no no for me was the music which I have to admit was really pants. Not so much the songs the band play during the film but the actual score itself. But that's just a minor gripe.Tim Robbins was so over the top and Jeffrey Jones was a hoot, so c'mon people, it's a kids movie about a talking duck. On that score it delivers on every level. 3.9 is mega harsh a score in my book so I've given it a 10 (not that it will make that much difference) my honest score would be a solid 7.Amusing, cheesy, plenty of fun action, decent effects for the time, ridiculously over the top and packed to the hilt with an 80's nostalgic feel, I'm sorry but I have to say it is a very good movie for what it is.

For all you people who hate this movie, you didn't really expect Gone with the wind or The sound of music from a film about a talking alien duck did you?Sure it was cheesy as hell, and some of the jokes were just terrible but the charm it oozes comes at you in bucket loads. The movie is over 20 years old and yet some of the special effects are better than in some of the dross out nowadays, and are definitely better than most movies out in the 80's.

I would submit that the public's views on Vietnam have changed since Kubrick made his film. Many Vietnam vets are now retiring and in recent years have finally been getting recognition for their service. The public's current determination to support the troops downrange, fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan, is a reflection of the shame we feel for the way we treated Vietnam vets back during their war. Even those who bitterly oppose the current war are quick to say they still support the troops---which to me his hypocritical, because how can you support people who are doing something you despise?I bought the movie after my brother linked me to a YouTube cut of the opening scene in the barracks where the gunny dresses down the maggots. A fan of Gunny Ermey, I enjoyed his performance, but from what I know of today's recruit training from TV documentaries and talks with current troops, many of Sgt. Hartman's methods would never be allowed in today's Marine Corps or other services. The training is tough and demanding and it must be so, because on the battlefield there is no room for sissies or cowards and attention to detail and willingness to follow orders are often life-or-death matters. Discipline is a must in a military unit and very few of today's young people, or those from any era, who enter the military have much in the way of self-discipline. The second half of the movie, depicting the Marines in Vietnam during Tet, has anti-war imagery that is almost too obvious. The Marines are now shown to be less than orderly in their discipline and sometimes close to being psychotic. They have little or no regard for the Vietnamese people and have no compunction about wasting civilians. The only Marine who shows empathy for the natives is Joker, who conspicuously wears a peace button in violation of direct orders from his superiors (and is apparently never reprimanded). The South Vietnamese culture is depicted as corrupt, as the only South Vietnamese we meet are thieves, pimps and prostitutes. By contrast, the only North Vietnamese soldier we see is a teenage girl, who prays as she is dying, something no American is shown doing. (How can she be a loyal communist and still be religious?) The message is clear the communists were noble patriots seeking to overthrow the corrupt Saigon regime which was being propped up by the imperialist Americans. Yes, there is the scene of Joker and Rafterman at the mass grave of South Vietnamese who have been murdered by the NVA, but the impact of the scene is lessened---indeed, its message completely turned around---when the officer describing the atrocity continually smiles for the camera and then the colonel upbraids Joker for wearing the peace button. What kind of message would Kubrick have sent had he shown the officer weeping as he described the murders, or had the angry colonel rip the button off Joker's vest and toss it into the grave, saying something like, These people could've used your (expletive) button, Marine. Then the peace-loving freedom-fighters would've left them alone, wouldn't they? It's been said that historical perspective about an event or era can only be achieved some fifty years after the fact, especially once many or most of the principals have died and so more objective accounts of their lives and contributions can be written. Now some 35 years after the end of our Vietnam involvement, we are beginning to see some of this. The Tet Offensive, launched by the NVA and VC during the holiday truce, was a sign of things to come; after all, Hanoi blithely ignored the Paris accords once their own military and infrastructure had sufficiently recovered from the pounding it received from us in the early '70s and Nixon, who had no qualms about sending armadas of B-52s over the North, was out of office.Kubrick was undoubtedly a good filmmaker, but his films seemed often to be almost too cerebral for the average viewer, visually stunning but conceptually muddled.

At that time to me, it was one of the best war movies I had ever seen. Due to my prior readings on the battle, I knew it followed the history fairly well, and I was able to tune out the romance sub plot. The look of movie was something that was something I was not familiar with in war movies up to that point. The indoor officers were in nice neat uniforms, while the pilots, Marines, and common sailors had a weary rumpled look. And the language! I had not yet heard so much cursing in a war movie (it was 1976 and for the most part John Wayne type movies were the norm). But I loved it all! I knew most of the planes shown on screen were not accurate, and much of the combat footage was from later in the war. But it showed a different type of war movie. The Japanese were strong, smart, and nearly invincible. Not monsters or maniacs, but allowing overconfidence at times to cloud some decisions. The Americans were brave, novices, unsure of themselves at times, yet determined not to fail, no matter the cost. Not the overpowering unbeatable force of years to come later in the war. Watching during the initial phases of combat as obsolete US planes were shot down one by one by the superior Japanese fighters, I was captivated by the self sacrifice(a year later the ending dogfight in Star Wars would make me think of Torpedo 8). Then the tide turned as events, luck, and timing change the course of battle. In the end, the US wins, the Japanese are defeated, and survivors ponder the results and reasons why briefly. Flash forward 32 years later and I watch this movie again on my DVD copy on the 66th anniversary of the battle. This movie holds up not too badly against the test of time. Much time has passed in by movie making and in my gaining knowledge of this subject. To me the strengths still hold, as do the weaknesses. The interracial romance subplot is certainly a 70s addition. Certainly not believable in a historical context. The stock footage of aircraft certainly still glares in error as well. Color footage was shot during the battle and released in a documentary. A small amount was incorporated into the movie. Much more could have replaced other sequences that were used in the movie. Many of the Tora!Tora!Tora! conversion aircraft were still local to Universal Studios at Orange County or Chino airports at the time of filming. Some were used in the Midway Island bombing sequence, but not in the Yorktown attacks. Too bad they did not make more use of them for a better look. The Japanese film sequences from Storm Over the Pacific actually worked very well for their capturing the look of the Japanese carriers and the activities on board. As did the lifted opening from 30 seconds Over Tokyo. Much of the dialog on film is true to life with certain quotes historically accurate. Look at that b*****d burn, was the first radio message clearly heard on the US carriers letting them know any of the air strikes had made contact and been successful. It also holds up sticking fairly close to the time line of actual events, but there are several events omitted. Finally the effects were not bad. For pre CGI the choices are to build full scale mocks ups, use an area or item that has a resemblance or miniatures. All three methods were used to good effect. And the results were for the most part just as good as, if not better than the more modern (film making wise) CGI heavy Pearl Harbor.

He's not drunk in the film, he's perfectly in control of his little audience, telling dirty jokes and getting them to cough up for Jesus at the same time.

Elmer's pickup shares his bed that night but she's certainly drunk, face-down and still fully-clothed in the morning, Hollywood moving on but tentatively.. Elmer's a man of the flesh with a grounding in faith, an ex-divinity student expelled for transgressing with the dean's daughter. He joins the congregation in a black church, leading the singing enthusiastically. A man of the people who understands their needs - and the gain to be had from exploiting the Great Mystery. With Sister Sharon's high-pressure operation he becomes the star-performer, a preacher without credentials or commitment, a Player King without a throne. Sharon's sights are fixed on Heaven with her own tabernacle to boost her claim but Elmer persuades her to tarry awhile and share more basic pleasures.

Elmer's a man of the flesh with a grounding in faith, an ex-divinity student expelled for transgressing with the dean's daughter. He joins the congregation in a black church, leading the singing enthusiastically. A man of the people who understands their needs - and the gain to be had from exploiting the Great Mystery. With Sister Sharon's high-pressure operation he becomes the star-performer, a preacher without credentials or commitment, a Player King without a throne. Sharon's sights are fixed on Heaven with her own tabernacle to boost her claim but Elmer persuades her to tarry awhile and share more basic pleasures. (When he leads her into the darkness we get a crashing melodramatic chord that sounds awfully corny today. A bolt of lightning as a follow-up wouldn't have been a surprise). A sweet setup - but when Lulu's back in town for a slice of the action the demands of Heaven and Earth get all snarled up and the edifice starts to crumble.. Sharon dies in the fire because she chooses to martyr herself, consumed by the moment into obeying a perceived destiny that finally puts her beyond all human reach. The crowd, accordingly, deserts her in panic and it's the crowd - the people - that prevent Gantry from saving her. When he leaves town at the end to return to the road selling 'fridges to Eskimos the newsman says See you, brother, to which Gantry replies emphatically See you in Hell, brother. This exchange was censored on the grounds it showed he hadn't 'reformed'. Rather it confirms him as an honest sinner with no illusions about where his own destiny will take him. This cut creates an ugly jump and an awkward silence, marring the film's final effect. Why can't the Restoration boys work a 'miracle' and plug this embarrassing gap ? Burt got his own back in the Seventies by using the line for Ned Buntline's farewell in BUFFALO BILL AND THE INDIANS. I tend to agree to an extent with some comments on Simmons - lovely, skillful, intelligent, deserving of her status but a little too English in her American roles. She never suggests Katie Jones from Shantytown here (any more than Audrey Hepburn did Lulu Mae Barnes in BREAKFAST AT TIFFANY'S) She did become Mrs Richard Brooks soon afterwards so I presume he was biased ! But it's an enthralling grown-up movie with Lancaster in full sail and a special nod to Arthur Kennedy.

In her short life, with the support of her parents and husband, the vivacious young Selena lived the dream of every girl. Nava does a fine job of telling the story. He shows us how happy Selena was with her life (even though there were ups and downs) and she lived it to the fullest. In her short 23 years she achieved what would take a lifetime for some. This was a life that wasn't a waste because Selena knew hot to live life.But the best thing about 'Selena' is Jennifer Lopez. Those were the days when Lopez acted her heart out on screen as has also been apparent in 'Out of Sight' and 'Blood and Wine'. Not only that, but Lopez looks stunning. Many prefer the way she looks today but in 'Selena' there's an innocence and honesty about her beauty and this coupled with her natural and spirited performance is a delight to watch. The supporting cast that includes Edward James Olmos, Jon Seda and Constance Marie are all very good too.I loved the way the soundtrack was used in the film and it brings a lot of energy to the story. The cinematography is quite good but I did not like the 3 split screen.Even though we know the tragic fate of Selena, this film reminds us that it's more important to live a big life than a long life. Make full use of what you have and take your chance. That's what Selena did. She was loved by her friends and family and won the hearts of millions. Strongly recommended.

He turned a seemingly generic card-themed flick into something magnificent I don't even know where to start.

It turns out the game was rigged and the four of them ended up owing Harry half a million pounds and they have a week to come up with the money. Their genius plan to come up with the money draws the ire of some notable figures of London's underbelly like marijuana-dealer Rory Breaker, old school London thug Dog and debt collector Big Chris. The events that will follow is either a) funny, b) hilariously funny, c) wickedly entertaining or d) just pure black comedy genius.This film is just too darn good. Its a healthy mix of black comedy, style, flair, wickedness, dark humor and awesome, magnificent turn of events. The casting and characterization is perfect, and Ritchie isn't afraid to move the cameras around; no pretense is really made here at realism - Ritchie doesn't mask the fact that it's a film and he runs with it.The dialogs were perfect that is if you understand what the hell they're saying. At first if you don't understand the dialogs, just be patient because you'll get used to it.The last 30 minutes or so is probably the highest point of the film. All these colorful characters collide each with their own agendas and you will be laughing until the end. The closing frame of the film will either shock you or leave you in a cliff, hanging. The ending of the film is probably one of the greatest movie endings of all time with the accompaniment of that catchy song, this film is overall one heck of a treat.

The movie gives a glimpse into the life of Carlo Roschi (better known as Farinelli) - one of the great opera singers of the 18th century. Farinelli (played by Stefano Dionisi) was a castrato - castrated as a young boy in order to preserve his brilliant soprano voice. Admittedly, it's a bit off putting to see a male portrayed as singing soprano (I say portrayed, because I assume Dionisi was lip-synching, since we don't have castratos today.) But while Farinelli's singing was the centerpiece of the movie, what's really being portrayed here (and, from what I've been able to glean, not entirely accurately, although I'm no expert on 18th century opera singers!) are the complex relationships in Farinelli's life - especially his relationship with his brother Riccardo (Enrico Lo Verso.) Carlo was the brilliant singer; Riccardo seems to have been a rather average composer - but, trying to keep a promise made to their father, they work as a team. The relationship is bizarre, and sometimes even vaguely erotic. Riccardo describes a love between them more passionate than that between lovers - and perhaps because of that passion there are huge amounts of jealousy and anger as well as love. The two brothers share everything - including women, in what are portrayed as strange tag-team sorts of sexual encounters, where - to put it bluntly - Riccardo finishes what Carlo can only start. There's also an interesting exploration of Farinelli's relationship with the great composer Handel (Jeroen Krabbe), which revolves around their work for rival opera houses in London. It's really very interesting.The movie is mostly in Italian and French, which necessitates subtitles for English speakers, which I always find a bit distracting. I was also disappointed that the movie depicts virtually nothing of Farinelli's time in the Spanish court, where Farinelli became court musician to King Philip V - and apparently very influential, as well. Still, it's very well done, and you don't have to be a fan of opera to enjoy this. 8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"5 June 2008","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" This movie has something of a kinship with Amadeus, portraying as it does the important cultural significance of music in a very different time and place - far more significant than music is today - but it's a much darker movie than Amadeus (which itself has some dark undertones.)
