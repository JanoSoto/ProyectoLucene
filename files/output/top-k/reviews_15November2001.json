(Please do not see this movie without at least a vague idea of the plot.) Book fans will find this film stays pretty true to the source, and only minimal details were kept out of the movie for time allotment reasons. If you are a parent and you want to take a small child, please understand that the length of this movie (about 2hours and 45 minutes) is not very suitable for some younger viewers. The action and climax of the plot was very satisfying, but there are some periods of plot development when the little ones will probably get squirmish. Older Potter fans will have nothing to worry about, as each scene in this movie is worth absorbing with great fervor. Be sure to watch the paintings on the walls in the background, I found many background special effects rather entertaining. Apart from the awesome plot and satisfying (but a bit hurried) quidditch game, the two best parts of the movie were (don't worry, I won't spoil the plot) 1. Oliver Wood, the Gryffindor Captain, played by Sean Biggerstaff. This guy definitely stole the show in his few scenes. He was gorgeous and had an accent, and I only wish they could have put him in more parts of the film. =) 2. Ron's (Ruert Grint) various facial expressions really conveyed his innocence, and he was just fun to watch.

I couldn't think of a better intro than that.  I'm trying to avoid things that have been said and will be said.  Things like `If you haven't heard of Harry Potter...' and `Pottermania is sweeping the nation...'  I saw Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone.  Regardless of anything anyone writes or says about the movie, it will be a huge hit.  Fortunately, it's a good flick.Now, the movie assumes that the audience will know pretty much everything about Harry and his friends.  So, much of the film feels like Harry Potter and The Abridgement of The Sorcerer's Stone.  More on that later.For those of you unfamiliar with the Potter mythos, here's the setup.  Harry (Radcliffe) is a wizard.  But, he doesn't know it.  His parents were killed when he was a baby, and he was left on the doorstep of his closest relatives, the Dursley's.  Uncle Vernon (Richard Griffiths) and Aunt Petunia (Fiona Shaw) are muggles.  (That's wizardese for non-magic users.)  And they hate anything that is out of the ordinary, including Harry.  Harry sleeps in the closet under the stairs, and is tormented by his cousin, Dudley (Harry Melling).  This has gone on for 11 years.  One day, a letter arrives for Harry from the Hogwarts Academy for Wizards.  This is not welcome in the Dursley house, you can bet that.  Uncle Vernon wants nothing to do with these stinking letters, and, after much ado, he moves the family out to a house on an island where no one can deliver the mail.  That, however, doesn't stop Rubeus Hagrid (Coltrane) from finding Harry, and taking him to Hogwarts, after stopping in Diagon Alley to pick up his school supplies.  Everyone, it seems, knows Harry, and the legend surrounding him.  He was the only survivor of the attack that killed his parents.  Harry, just 1 year old, seems to have beaten the greatest threat that the world of magic has ever faced &#150; the dread Lord Voldemort, or He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named.  Harry has lots to learn about wizards, witches, and the world he now lives in.  Fortunately, he has help from his friends Ron Weasley (Grint), Hermione Granger (Watson), Hagrid, and Headmaster Albus Dumbledore (Harris).  Unfortunately, he also has to put up with Professor Serverus Snape (Rickman), Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton) and his gang, and staying out of the trouble that young wizards and witches tend to get into.For those of you familiar with the Potter stories, here's a good place to resume reading.Overall, the movie was very good.  However, as I said, parts of it felt like an abridgement.  `Well, duh,' you're probably thinking.  `They couldn't put EVERYTHING in.'  And, I agree.  But, the things that were cut out were the things that I really liked about the book.  Harry's relationship with the Dursley's, for instance.  There is some very, very funny stuff to be found there.  It also seemed like they made Harry `nicer' in the movie.  He's not a jerk by any stretch of the imagination.  But, he gets into less trouble in the movie... OK, I have to stop this right now.  I'm not trying to compare the book and the movie, I'm here to tell you about the movie...I think I can continue now.What was good about Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone?  Many, many things.  The casting was dead-on.  Especially with the non-Harry characters.  Emma Watson is perfect as Hermione Granger.  Rupert Grint was also a great choice for Ron Weasley.  Draco Malfoy and his gang are also played very well by those actors.  And the actors (yes, actors) who played Harry Potter did fine jobs.  Two people played Harry, because Radcliffe's voice changed during the filming.  So, in some scenes (I think I spotted one), Harry's voice is done by Joe Sowerbutts.  I understand that Sowerbutts also plays the voice of Harry in various other media.The special effects were also quite good.  Mostly.  The mixing of real and computer-generated backgrounds and animations is good for the most part, but not universally.  Some of the CGI characters were outstanding &#150; Hagrid's dragon Norbert and Fluffy, the 3-headed dog, come to mind as great examples.  The Quidditch match between Gryffindor and Slytherin is lots of fun to watch, but not quite up to par with the previous &#145;cool' CGI sequence &#150; the pod race in The Phantom Menace.  Of course, since Industrial Light and Magic did the special effects for Harry Potter, it's understandable, since ILM is working on another movie you may have heard of.  Star Wars Episode II &#150; Attack of the Clones.  But, hey, the special effects do their job, and I'm not gonna complain.  Sometimes it's apparent that the people are acting in front of a green screen, but, for the target audience, they'll be mind-blowing.  Probably the best effect in the movie is Hagrid.  I don't know if they used CGI trickery, or prosthetic limbs, but Robbie Coltrane sure does look at least 8 feet tall.  That's certainly bigger than should be allowed.  (The previous sentence used to prove that I am not a muggle.)Go and see this movie.  If for no other reason than you'll be able to understand what kids these days are talking about.  If you already know, you won't be disappointed in the adaptation.  If you don't know, well, you're in for a treat.  It's not like you will be able to avoid the franchise.

Truly a lovely and enchanting tale that focuses on good against evil, but without the usual condescending hoopla!

I have never heard of an actor named James Dean until recently. I, like a lot of teenagers, are facing problems that may seem trivial to adults but the world to us. Rebel Without A Cause was made 31 years before I was born...and yet, it is the only movie that I have seen that I can fully relate to. Rebel Without A Cause is definitely not dated; it's timeless. Jim Stark, Plato and Judy are teenagers who seek love and understanding in a world where they don't seem to fit in anywhere. They are lonely, and ultimately seek solace in each other. I'm a teenager living in the 21st century, yet I can identify with Jim Stark and relate to him. Over-protective parents who seem to be afraid to face up to who their children really are, and don't seem to have a clue how to guide them? Friends who like you when you're fun, and drop you when the going gets tough? I've been there, done that, and am still there.Director Nicholas Ray described Rebel as a movie about a kid who just wants one day in his life when things are not confused. I cannot begin to express how many times I have felt that way in my life. To me, Rebel is way more than just another classic, or just another James Dean film; it has become my personal ally in my journey to get rid of teen angst once and for all. It is perhaps the most important film I have ever seen, and it is one that has affected me personally the most. Rebel understands teenagers, and not just teens of the late 50's, it understands teenagers of any period and time who are facing the same problems as Jim, Judy and Plato.The character of Jim Stark is well-written, and brilliantly portrayed by the phenomenal and talented James Dean (who is one of my favourite actors). It has been said that James Dean played himself in this movie, but the way I see it, he became Jim. I don't know, maybe Jim is a lot like James, but if they ever decide to update Rebel, although there really isn't a need to, no actors would be able to even come close to what Dean has achieved. He deserved a Best Actor Oscar for his role, but then again, the Academy is practically known for being blind dingbats who award their awards to the wrong people (1994's Best Supporting to Tommy Lee Jones instead of Leonardo DiCaprio; this year's Best Actress to Julia Roberts instead of Ellen Burstyn, etc), and winning an Oscar doesn't necessarily measure the merit of a person's cinematic work, so...it's okay.Sal Mineo delivered a touching performance as Plato, as did Natalie Wood as Judy. Their Oscar nominations were well-deserved. But the ultimate performance here is still James Dean's. Jim Stark is someone you could see during that time, heck he's still someone you can see now. The scene that made the most impact in my mind is that part when Jim returns home from the chickie run and gets into a huge fight with his parents, when Jim begs his father to stand up for me. It just touched me in a way that few films have touched me; I ached for Jim, and could relate so well to that part.All in all, Rebel Without A Cause is an amazing movie. It's timeless, it's very relevant to people like me, and it should be seen by everybody. 10\/10.

However, recently, I saw it again on video and liked it for this exact same reason and more. The movie begins with a credit sequence of gun shots, grainy photos from the movie, and great music by Ennio Morricone that already tells you to expect a trip that´s exciting and fun. Then it rushes straight into a set of fight scenes which introduce the three main characters very dramatically (complete with titles to let you know which adjective in the title each character represents). Each of these characters is a morally flawed person who makes a living off of death. The Bad Angel Eyes makes his living as a soldier and a mercenary. The Good Blondie makes his living by making a travesty of hangings by always freeing the convicted men he turns in for reward money just before the rope should kill them. His goodness is only relative. The Ugly Tuco basically makes his living any way he can and his list of crimes is absurdly varied (ranging from all kinds of violence to statutory rape). He is a true opportunist without overriding morals but not entirely without a conscience. Played by Eli Wallach, Tuco actually steals the show from his 2 more famous costars because while they are almost superhuman in their skills, he is strikingly human in all his flaws. All three of these men, on individual terms, eventually come to know of a fortune buried in a graveyard and constantly keep fighting each other for knowledge of its exact location since each man only knows a different hint of where it is hidden and not the whole story. While such a plot does not seem too great, Sergio Leone choreographs every scene (violent or otherwise)to make it as suspenseful and expertly made as possible. The film also gets a lot of its entertainment value from Tarantinoishly holding nothing sacred. The three heroes scheme against other characters with a joyfully effortless malevolence, and  not even the American Civil War is held sacred as the men try to manipulate the senseless conflict full of hopelessly drunken soldiers to make their quest for the treasure easier. The result of all this is that although The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly is more than 3 hours long, there is never a dull moment, making it seem about an hour or so shorter than it actually is. What´s most important, though, is that it is a thinking person´s action movie which unpretentiously demonstrates the absurdity of real life and helps us to laugh at it.

I thought it was like an action movie but without the comforting elements usually associated with action movies like moral clarity and extremely spectacular fight scenes. However, recently, I saw it again on video and liked it for this exact same reason and more. The movie begins with a credit sequence of gun shots, grainy photos from the movie, and great music by Ennio Morricone that already tells you to expect a trip that´s exciting and fun. Then it rushes straight into a set of fight scenes which introduce the three main characters very dramatically (complete with titles to let you know which adjective in the title each character represents). Each of these characters is a morally flawed person who makes a living off of death. The Bad Angel Eyes makes his living as a soldier and a mercenary. The Good Blondie makes his living by making a travesty of hangings by always freeing the convicted men he turns in for reward money just before the rope should kill them. His goodness is only relative. The Ugly Tuco basically makes his living any way he can and his list of crimes is absurdly varied (ranging from all kinds of violence to statutory rape). He is a true opportunist without overriding morals but not entirely without a conscience. Played by Eli Wallach, Tuco actually steals the show from his 2 more famous costars because while they are almost superhuman in their skills, he is strikingly human in all his flaws. All three of these men, on individual terms, eventually come to know of a fortune buried in a graveyard and constantly keep fighting each other for knowledge of its exact location since each man only knows a different hint of where it is hidden and not the whole story. While such a plot does not seem too great, Sergio Leone choreographs every scene (violent or otherwise)to make it as suspenseful and expertly made as possible. The film also gets a lot of its entertainment value from Tarantinoishly holding nothing sacred. The three heroes scheme against other characters with a joyfully effortless malevolence, and  not even the American Civil War is held sacred as the men try to manipulate the senseless conflict full of hopelessly drunken soldiers to make their quest for the treasure easier. The result of all this is that although The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly is more than 3 hours long, there is never a dull moment, making it seem about an hour or so shorter than it actually is. What´s most important, though, is that it is a thinking person´s action movie which unpretentiously demonstrates the absurdity of real life and helps us to laugh at it.

I loved Pi and had been looking forward to see what (writer\/director) Darren Aronofsky would come up with next. And for a while I was completely blown away by Requiem.  The acting was wonderful and the cinematography and editing were absolutely incredible - kinetic, musical and truly unique.  Given it's stunning first hour, it should have been a great film.  But a thread of truly puritanical preachiness runs through Requiem and after a while it comes to dominate the whole movie.Basically, this is a film about addiction, addiction to love, addiction to food, to habit, to memory, hope, approval, the future and of course addiction to drugs both legal and illegal.  The film doesn't distinguish much between these addictions, instead it layers them atop one another and allows them to reflect off of and inform one another.  We watch the central characters struggle with and against their consumptive, redemptive and addictive impulses and we witness the terrible toll these interlinked impulses exact upon their never more than pitiful lives.All four central characters are drawn in broad, bleak strokes the gorgeous yet naive art-school girl, her equally naive street-rat boyfriend, the junkie boyfriend's junkie partner in crime and the boyfriend's diet-pill-popping, food and television obsessed mom.  Although the performances are uniformly excellent, the characters are thin shells who exist only to demonstrate their internal failings.  I admit they're exquisitely rendered shells, with far more detail and nuance than one usually sees in such cautionary tales, but in the end each character is a simple straw man, designed with only his or her own destruction in mind.That's the problem.  The central point (addiction is bad) is simplistic, and its delivery is staggeringly ham-fisted.  Up to a point, I was willing to go along for the ride, led willingly by the truly spectacular eye-candy filling the screen and the exceptionally fine performances that drive the story forward, but after a while I just gave up.  I could see the end coming; I could see the Moral Message written in huge, black letters all over it, and I just didn't care any more.  Life is not a lesson.  Film can be, but don't we as an audience deserve a little more intellectual credit than that?What could have been an accessible yet experimental observation of the addict's life, presenting both the ups and downs, the good and bad with an eye toward observational truth (with a small t), instead sinks under the weight of it's embarrassingly fatuous and self-important missionary zeal (every single letter in boldface caps).  It's like one of those cautionary splatter movies from driver's ed or an after school special about the maladjusted girl who starts slipping a little of mom's vodka into her O.J. at lunch time.  Given the money, the talent and the effort expended, such reductive hectoring seems like a terrible waste.Watch it for the cinematography, the editing, the soundtrack, the very pretty young people with nice hair, and watch it for the performances, especially Ellen Burstyn as Sara Goldfarb, but be prepared to be pummeled instructively for what feels like days.
