Handsome in a James Deanish way but without the extravagant thespianism, and not afraid to have himself thoroughly deglamorized when the part calls for it. And that's him in Blink. He even musters a first-class Chicago accent (not surprising) for a film shot in Chicago. Madeleine Stowe is equally appealing, in part for quite different reasons. She has a low voice that is simultaneously throaty and nasal (all her sinuses seem to be pumping away like a dolphin's) and she has a tendency to break into endearing childish giggles when she is about to undergo a corneal transplant, overjoyed at the prospect of being able to see again. And on top of all that she is a beautiful woman with a slender and very feminine body, the kind of figure you might see in a 19th-century illustration of Hans Christian Anderson's fairy tale about the little mermaid, only better because Stowe has legs as well as a tail. I also give her bonus points because this is her most vulgar, spunkiest performance on screen.The film doesn't have a lot of action in it. There is not a car chase in sight, nothing explodes, and all the murders but one take place off camera. About five shots are fired all together. But Apted, the director, has organized everything so that it rambles along without a boring moment, except perhaps for the predictable shoot-out at the end. We have a half-blind woman in jeopardy locked up in a big garage with some moron who wants to tear her eyeballs out. Give me back those eyes that belong to her, he says, or something like that. The situation is straight out of Helpful Hints for Screenwriters -- Part Three, Section Two, Subsection A, sub b, backslash 4. Put a blind woman in a dark room with a murderer. In fact, the script is the weakest part of the movie. The heavy is another serial killer following a pattern which it takes the cops two hours to figure out. (He's collecting the organs that were harvested from his dead girl friend.) Some of it makes no sense. What's the business with the Byzantine cross? Why does he slash his victim's wrists postmortem so that the blood will drain away and the organ transplants no longer of use? (That is, since nobody bleeds after death anyway.) And -- okay -- I can buy delayed perception, although I've never heard of it, but after her transplant Stowe begins hallucinating her mother, the killer, her boyfriend, her neighbors, even in their absence. We're only one step away here from the old Helpful Hints for Screenwriters story of the transplanted organs that carry the impulses and sensations of their donors. (Cf., The Hands of Orlac or whatever.) Enough to make me worry about my hair transplants. There is also something about Stowe's wanting to be in control all the time, a desire of which nothing is made in the script, and is only there to provide something for her and Quinn to fight about.But Apted pretty much compensates for these weaknesses through sheer efficiency. He even handles the atmosphere people with notable effectiveness. (When Stowe bursts out of the police station's men's room after a brutal argument with Quinn, we see a knot of cops in the background who have been eavesdropping and they casually break up and stroll away.)There are also themes that explore the sensory apparatus of the human body. Actually, it's quite a sensuous film. The chief theme of course is Stowe's vision, and she's the actress for the part because her eyes are slightly crossed. We get some idea of her vision from time to time through a distorting lens and some morphing, but it's a technique that's only used when it's called for. There are no visual fireworks other than that. None of the shots calls attention to itself, as in, Look, Ma, I'm a Director! It's a tactile movie too. There are two or three love scenes between Quinn and Stowe and they're pretty rambunctious. Lamps get knocked over and all that, and she feels faces and hands, while Quinn feels her. Pretty sexy actually, but not at all titillating. Stowe has said she always made love with her eyes closed while she was blind, and fantasized a good deal, and in one such session Quinn asks her to open her eyes and look at him. It's a rather tender moment. The chemical senses are represented only by smell, taste being neglected. There are lots of flowers in this movie. When Quinn visits the home of victim number three, the husband had just brought his wife a large bouquet, and Quinn is holding another bunch of flowers. In one scene, Stowe tiptoes nude up to a vase full of roses that Quinn has given her and she sniffs one rapturously. And then there is the surgical soap. As for the kinetic senses, there are several sports scenes -- basketball (two) and baseball (1), in addition to the rather strenuous lovemaking. The auditory sense is centered around music. Stowe plays the violin. Quinn brings her CDs of The Drovers, the Irish band she plays with, of Vivaldi, and of Pearl Jam. Eclectic, remarks Stowe. I was drunk, replies Quinn.This is worth watching if it happens along on cable. It's even worth renting.

Not only do men get beaten to a pulp, women do, too. There is a nitty-gritty feel to the film that does not go unnoticed. Even a dog gets shot - but the dog does not die, of course, because that would be showing something inhumane. Screw any human corpses that might (God help us!) appear on screen - dog corpses will send audiences fleeing!With all the major advertising for this film, you probably know by now that Mel Gibson plays a bad guy in Payback. He's never played an all-out bad guy like this before - his baddie in Tequila Sunrise was a nice bad guy, this guy is a bad bad guy with streaks of bad. In a world of evil people he is the one we root for because the film has been crafted that way, and because he is a one-man-army (we always feel sorry for the underdogs) - but if you put him in a room with Riggs and Murtaugh, his chances for applause from an audience would be significantly decreased. Gibson plays Porter. I don't know his first name, he's just always gone by Porter, a man says later in the film. Porter is a thief. As the credits role, he wakes up from a (wound-induced coma\/injury\/nap). In the first five minutes, he has stolen from a crippled Vietnam veteran, pickpocketed a man's wallet, stiffed a waitress, and used the said credit card to buy a nice fancy suit and dinner. Later, when his meal is over, a waiter informs him the credit card he is trying to pay with has been canceled. Nonsense, Porter says. Try it again. The waiter then leaves and so does Porter.In his sadistic voice-over narration, Porter informs us, Not many men know how much their lives are worth. I do. Seventy grand. That's how much they took from me, that's how much I was gonna get back. We find out that some time before his coma\/nap, Porter had pulled off a heist - only to be pumped full of lead by his friend, Val (Gregg Henry), and his wife (Deborah Kara Ungar), who took the cash and ran.Now Porter's back, and he wants his money. Not any less, and not any more. Porter doesn't want the money as much as he wants to teach people not to mess with him. As always, there is a love interest, and going with the dirty flow of the film, this love interest is a hooker named Rosie (Maria Bello). Porter used to drive Rosie, and we find out at a seemingly haphazard point in the film that they shared a night of passion together.The film is dreadfully a-typical, but Mel Gibson's sadistic lead performance makes it worth watching. He hisses and uses violence like a real screen villain, while at the same time he spews out harsh (and funny) one-liners with such comedic talent that it is hard to imagine anyone else in the role.David Paymer and Bill Duke also have small roles as crooked cops (although I'm not sure if Paymer is a cop he hangs out with them). You may remember Bill Duke as Mac from Predator, the Arnold Schwarzenegger film. He's a good co-star, if a bit repetitive, and David Paymer provides some comic relief.Basically everyone dies in Payback. Everyone except You-Know-Who and You-Know-Who's Girl. Oh, and The Dog (who I have a feeling will spawn a spin-off series of sequels named Pawback). During an hour and fifty minutes, six men are incinerated in fire, countless men are shot, and James Coburn's alligator skin suitcases get a bullet through them. And Mel does a great job of carrying the lead role in what would at first appear to be an action-star-crafted character.
