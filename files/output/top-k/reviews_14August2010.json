Now, I have seen this film when it first came out and I wasn't very fond of it. I had the chance to re-view it and I remember why I disliked it. It was very boring and dull. Now I know its based on a true story and I understand what that means, but I didn't really like the sorry. It just seemed too boring at many parts, and it was very predictable. The characters were okay but in general not that great. Jake Gyllenhaal's acting was decent as the lead but it was his friends and others whose acting was lacking. This movie is basically about a guy- Homer Hickam (Gyllenhaal) whose has dreams of creating his own rocket because of one he recently sen on television. He eventually creates it and ends up winning in their science fair. Everything was predictable. Also this story was based in the 50's so that's why they all speak like that and the way they wear their clothing. The rockets were nice and all but overall this movie is lacking of excitement and entertainment. Its just not for everyone, and that is clear. Bad movie, don't watch it ","genre":null},{"date":"14 August 2010","score":"2 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" October Sky tells the story of a small town boy who follows his dreams and eventually succeeds at what he dreamt of since his youth.

Now he is given command of the brand new Red October, a submarine with a revolutionary new propulsion system making the submarine almost completely silent, and hence untrackable. Of course it is a submarine and technology the Americans fear, and want their hands on, and the Soviets want to keep secret and not ever lose, especially not to the Americans. So when Ramius, contrary to his given orders, engages the propulsion system and sets full speed for the US east coast, the development in the Atlantic will be very interesting indeed. And the only one that might understand what Ramius is up to is Jack Ryan, an navy analyst.Comments A classic in its genre and deservedly so. It is intense, and despite being quite long with a runtime over two hours, never slows down. There are always some new development, partly thanks to that there are a few different perspectives shown, but mostly thanks to a masterfully written and directed story.It is also give to a great cast, spearheaded by Sean Connery. But when you have supporting actors like Sam Neill, Alec Baldwin, Tim Curry, James Earl Jones and so forth, you are right to expect a certain level of acting, and they certainly don't disappoint.It is a movie I enjoyed very much, and it stands the test of time, despite being 20 years old now. Good suspense never gets old. And actually, it manages to keep my interest even when I've seen the movie before, that's rare. From me, it is highly recommended.8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"14 August 2010","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Recap Marko Ramius is a living legend in the Soviet Submarine Navy.
