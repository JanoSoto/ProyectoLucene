It's sensory overload for Ariel and for the viewer from start to finish, but in the most positive way. It's a bit sad that some of the voice actors here (Flotsam & Jetsam, Triton, Scuttle) are dead now, but as it's almost 25 years since this film was made just shows what a timeless classic it has become. My favorite moment was Ariel singing in the film early Part of Your World and swimming up to the moonlight. Such a beautifully mesmerizing song and scene. While it was IMHO the best song of the movie and I'm pretty surprised it did not get the Oscar nomination, all the other songs are really good as well. Under the Sea, maybe my least favorite won the Oscar. I see it more as a Hakuna Matata, a great fun song with little depth,, so it's a bit surprising it was chosen as the best song at the Golden Globes and Academy Awards. Kiss the Girl is an amazing love song about taking the initiative and is very much worth listening to, just like Poor Unfortunate Souls, one of Disney's best villain songs ever. The latter is sung by Ursula, the main antagonist here and, long before she becomes a giant monster, already an epic villain here that may have changed the way we perceive octopuses forever to the negative.Ariel's best friend is a yellow-blue fish with the voice of a child, who rarely speaks, but is always loyal to her, even if he's scared quickly and it certainly doesn't help that there's always sharks around under the sea. Another friend is a bird who teaches Ariel about the human world and always knows what it is used for when Ariel shows him another item from the human world. Sadly, these descriptions are never accurate, which Ariel doesn't know of course, so she uses a fork for combing her hair at some point for example. Story-wise Ariel happens to rescue a Prince from drowning. Her father, however, doesn't want her to have any contact with humans, so he destroys her cavern which includes a giant collection of human things. Desperate and disappointed Ariel goes to see the sea witch Ursula and makes a deal with her. When she seems to be winning the deal, Ursula appears and tricks the prince into thinking she's the real Ariel. But of course, there's a happy ending as in pretty much every Disney film.One character I haven't mentioned so far, is Sebastian, who, in my opinion is a definite contender for best supporting character in a Disney movie. He really leaves nothing to be desired. Initially loyal to Triton and instructed to look after Ariel, he's quickly captivated by her charm more and more as the film progresses and the very moment he realizes how Ariel will be unhappy for the rest of her life if she stays under the sea is just so much filled with excellence. Oh did I mention, he's also the royal court composer and a crab? Besides that, he's probably also the character who will provide the most comic relief and be the children's favorite. His chase scenes with the cook are simply hilarious. And when he assembles the orchestra, it's a win-win for everybody as we see ducks playing drums on turtle's bellies and the wildest ways music and performances can take by all the sea creatures involved.This animated version of Hans Christian Andersen's tale is simply a thing of beauty. It certainly is my new favorite film from 1989. The underwater world they created is pure movie magic, a feast for eyes and ears. Watch it with the one you love and you'll have a great time. It's also a great watch for fathers with their daughters thanks to the Triton-Ariel storyline. Most animated films these days are funny and stunning to look at, but hardly any reach the level of The Little Mermaid especially in terms of emotional impact the longing for love, the longing for freedom, even if you have to make sacrifices for it, or just the way all kinds of human relationships are displayed metaphorically with the help of mermaids, fish and all kinds of other sea animals.

I was a kid and stupid, only caring about what's cool. What was cool then (and sadly still is) was dark and gritty heroes like Batman. Dick Tracy was considered corny and lame. When I first watched it I thought it was a kids' movie and I was at that age where anything like that I hated. Happily, I feel much differently about the film now that I'm older.Dick Tracy is a live-action cartoon, with eye-popping visuals decked out in bright primary colors. It's a beautiful film to behold. Everyone involved in the stylized look of this movie should be proud. The sets, the lighting, the matte paintings, the makeup and effects are all superior to any CGI crap we get today. Real work and passion went into this and it shows.The cast is great. Beatty is criticized by many for not being the right fit for Tracy or for being too old. While he's not a perfect representation of the character, I feel he does quite well and his age never occurred to me while watching it. Madonna gives easily her best performance in this movie. That's meant slightly as a slam I guess, as most of her other work is very weak. But it's also meant as a compliment. Here she plays to her strengths sex appeal and oomph. Her double entendres and skin-tight dresses make Breathless Mahoney a very memorable character. There's also some fine support from Glenne Headley and Charlie Korsmo. And who can forget the villains! Chester Gould's distinctive-looking villains come to life thanks to superb makeup, played in many cases by uncredited stars. The leader of the bunch is Big Boy Caprice, played by the wonderfully over-the-top Al Pacino. Pacino was having a lot of fun with the role and it shows.My only real complaint lies in the music. Not the Stephen Sondheim songs -- they're great. But the Danny Elfman musical score is way too similar to the one he did for Batman the year before. It's very lazy and doesn't seem to fit the action of the film. Forget what you've read from naysayers about this movie and judge it for yourself.

It is a combination of screwball comedy, romantic comedy, thriller and gangster. With great music and an ingenious screen writing by Billy Wilder and I.A.L. Diamond. The director is also Billy Wilder.The movie is set in 1929, during the time of the Prohibition. It starts when two Chicago musicians Joe (Tony Curtis) and Jerry(Jack Lemmon) have to run from the police. In the middle of the little chaos, the same luck brings them to witness a murder on Valentine's Day. Making them two wanted men by Chicago's mafia. While they are looking for a job, they find a vacant on a girl band group for saxophone and bass players, respectively the instruments they both play. In the desperation, they disguise as women and join the band. They name themselves Josephine (Joe) and Daphne (Jerry). While in the girl band, Joe falls in love with Sugar Kane (Marilyn Monroe) and an old millionaire man, Osgood Fielding (Joe E Brown), falls in love with Daphne. Making it funnier because Osgood does not know that Daphne is a guy.All of the main actors did an excellent performance, considering that it is seen as one of the greatest comedy films of all time. Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon are both dramatic and funny, which engages the audience with both of them. On the other hand, Marilyn Monroe is probably the most complex character. She acts as a more elegantly vulgar character and female drinker. She portrays the woman dependent of a man. And many have criticized the scene when she appears singing 'I Wanna Be Loved By You' with a nude color dress, and the lighting focused on a way that she appears to be naked.I loved the scene when Joe is sitting on the bench while the girls are in the beach because it gives the plot a major turn around, creating a third character portrayed by Joe. And it complicates everything more. The fact of a lie on top of another lie and other lies, which give the audience a sense of suspense about how will it turn out. One scene that I did not specifically loved was when there is a second murderer because it looks a bit unrealistic and it is the same thing occurring all over again. An unrealistically bad luck.This movie was considered extremely controversial and was even banned in certain places like Kansas. The fact of Joe and Jerry transforming themselves into Josephine and Daphne creates a sexual confusion on the very conservative time period that the movie was made. As the director Curtis Hanson said about the movie It's a film about sex &#x96; from the title to the final line. It's not just about sex as in people having sex; it's also about sexual attitudes, sexual roles and, of course, sexual identity. The relationship of Osgood and Daphne was probably the most criticized one because it becomes bigger and bigger at the point of them being engaged and when Joe asks Jerry Who's the lucky girl?, Jerry answers Me!.

It is a combination of screwball comedy, romantic comedy, thriller and gangster. With great music and an ingenious screen writing by Billy Wilder and I.A.L. Diamond. The director is also Billy Wilder.The movie is set in 1929, during the time of the Prohibition. It starts when two Chicago musicians Joe (Tony Curtis) and Jerry(Jack Lemmon) have to run from the police. In the middle of the little chaos, the same luck brings them to witness a murder on Valentine's Day. Making them two wanted men by Chicago's mafia. While they are looking for a job, they find a vacant on a girl band group for saxophone and bass players, respectively the instruments they both play. In the desperation, they disguise as women and join the band. They name themselves Josephine (Joe) and Daphne (Jerry). While in the girl band, Joe falls in love with Sugar Kane (Marilyn Monroe) and an old millionaire man, Osgood Fielding (Joe E Brown), falls in love with Daphne. Making it funnier because Osgood does not know that Daphne is a guy.All of the main actors did an excellent performance, considering that it is seen as one of the greatest comedy films of all time. Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon are both dramatic and funny, which engages the audience with both of them. On the other hand, Marilyn Monroe is probably the most complex character. She acts as a more elegantly vulgar character and female drinker. She portrays the woman dependent of a man. And many have criticized the scene when she appears singing 'I Wanna Be Loved By You' with a nude color dress, and the lighting focused on a way that she appears to be naked.I loved the scene when Joe is sitting on the bench while the girls are in the beach because it gives the plot a major turn around, creating a third character portrayed by Joe. And it complicates everything more. The fact of a lie on top of another lie and other lies, which give the audience a sense of suspense about how will it turn out. One scene that I did not specifically loved was when there is a second murderer because it looks a bit unrealistic and it is the same thing occurring all over again. An unrealistically bad luck.This movie was considered extremely controversial and was even banned in certain places like Kansas. The fact of Joe and Jerry transforming themselves into Josephine and Daphne creates a sexual confusion on the very conservative time period that the movie was made. As the director Curtis Hanson said about the movie It's a film about sex &#x96; from the title to the final line. It's not just about sex as in people having sex; it's also about sexual attitudes, sexual roles and, of course, sexual identity. The relationship of Osgood and Daphne was probably the most criticized one because it becomes bigger and bigger at the point of them being engaged and when Joe asks Jerry Who's the lucky girl?, Jerry answers Me!.

Yep, live-action tentacle porn.The film is rife with visual symbolism. This was written while the director was going through a bad divorce, which is obvious. Sam Neill comes home from an undefined espionage mission to find that his wife is acting extremely erratic and demanding a divorce. Things quickly get stressful. Their relationship deteriorates wildly. It's not too long before what appears to be a drama pitched at a hysterical emotional level evolves into a horror film about madness and slimy monsters from another place.Neill and Adjani spent the entire film screaming. Chairs are tossed, fridges are emptied on the floor, self-mutilation with electric carving knives ensues, people are beaten, lots of other self-destructive behavior follows. It's a mess of emotional trauma. Neill, near minutes in, lies on a bed, wearing the same clothes for weeks, seizing, running around in a daze. As the story goes on, he commits arson, theft, and murder. Adjani is in emotional turmoil throughout. In the second most famous scene, she stops in an alleyway, hysterical. She rolls around in filth, cries and wails. Finally, she coughs up milk, while blood and green slime flood out from under her dress, in an inexplicable miscarriage of&#x85; Something. Oh yeah, before that, she's masturbates in a church.The insanity extends to the rest of the cast. Adjani's (human) lover is a weirdo named Heinrich, a New Age guru. He hits on everybody, even Neill. He talks in an odd accent and is constantly moving his arms around. He does drugs and knows jujitsu throws. He also lives with his dowdy, suicidal mother. Bob, the son, is always making siren noises, when he isn't testing how long he can hold his breath. Adjani's best friend, Margit, wears a cast and romantically hits on everyone too. There's the world's most incompetent private eye, who is extremely bad at following people. A character known only as the Man in Pink Socks might know something about what is going on.The only normal person is Bob's teacher, Helen&#x85; Who is also played by Adjani. Why? Anna babbles about how there's a Sister of Chance and a Sister of Fate inside of her, warring for control. There's a bizarre scene of her torturing a girl in a ballet class. There might be something about the Madonna\/Whore dynamic, since Anna abandons motherhood in favor of a bizarre, sexual relationship. Neill falls for Helen and she immediately fills the mother role to Bob.There might be some Lovecraft influence. Carlo Rambaldi's monster is exactly the kind of creature HP wrote about. It's greenish, transparent, blood and organs flexing inside. It develops tentacles and feeds off of people's emotions. Eventually, glassy eyes form. You could throw adjectives around like proboscidian, semi-amorphous, or squamous to describe it. Moreover, SPOILER ALERT, the movie ends with this creature taking on human form. As he floats in front of a green glass door, visually illustrating forces pushing through one world to another, the lights fade and bombs are heard outside. It's an apocalyptic image and suggests this madness has a world-wide effect. Assuming I'm not just applying my own meaning to an inscrutable mess.And that's just the tip of the iceberg. There's so much insanity in Possession. It pretty much defies critical analysis. The performances, as out-of-control and high-pitched as they are, are quite good. If nothing else, Neill and Adjani commit fully to the rigorous material. The movie is well-shot. Zulawski's camera roams in creative ways. The electric score is softly unnerving. It's certainly not a movie you're likely to forget any time soon. You'll probably think it's either indecipherable pretentious nonsense or a very deep statement. I think I liked it, as much as it's possible to like a film like this.

It's infamous for two reasons For being one of the 72 Video Nasties and for being the movie where Isabelle Adjani has sex with a squid. Yep, live-action tentacle porn.The film is rife with visual symbolism. This was written while the director was going through a bad divorce, which is obvious. Sam Neill comes home from an undefined espionage mission to find that his wife is acting extremely erratic and demanding a divorce. Things quickly get stressful. Their relationship deteriorates wildly. It's not too long before what appears to be a drama pitched at a hysterical emotional level evolves into a horror film about madness and slimy monsters from another place.Neill and Adjani spent the entire film screaming. Chairs are tossed, fridges are emptied on the floor, self-mutilation with electric carving knives ensues, people are beaten, lots of other self-destructive behavior follows. It's a mess of emotional trauma. Neill, near minutes in, lies on a bed, wearing the same clothes for weeks, seizing, running around in a daze. As the story goes on, he commits arson, theft, and murder. Adjani is in emotional turmoil throughout. In the second most famous scene, she stops in an alleyway, hysterical. She rolls around in filth, cries and wails. Finally, she coughs up milk, while blood and green slime flood out from under her dress, in an inexplicable miscarriage of&#x85; Something. Oh yeah, before that, she's masturbates in a church.The insanity extends to the rest of the cast. Adjani's (human) lover is a weirdo named Heinrich, a New Age guru. He hits on everybody, even Neill. He talks in an odd accent and is constantly moving his arms around. He does drugs and knows jujitsu throws. He also lives with his dowdy, suicidal mother. Bob, the son, is always making siren noises, when he isn't testing how long he can hold his breath. Adjani's best friend, Margit, wears a cast and romantically hits on everyone too.

During that time, many action films were released, boasting names like Sylvester Stallone, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and Steven Seagal and usually served as nothing more than cinematic timekillers or blatant star vehicles for muscular men catering to an audience that beared heavy testosterone levels. From my very limited acquaintance with the genre, it seems the attractiveness of these films was their inanity and their craziness, along with their often far-fetched plot-points, far-from-realistic instances, and technical and aesthetic imperfections that are now widely different from the glossy, overly-polished action filmmaking techniques we're used to today.But who would've thought the actor to jump on this train would be Ben Affleck and the director to capture this moment be John Frankenheimer? This, unfortunately, marked a sour time in Affleck's career, as nearly every mainstream effort he did seemed to garner nothing but negativity, and was Frankenheimer's final directorial effort before his death in 2002. This isn't necessarily the best film to conclude a career like his on (he directed the original Manchurian Candidate and Seven Days in May). It's quite possible that if I saw this back when it was out, given the director's list of renowned films, I would've hated it. But if there's anything that has changed about me in recent years, I'm beginning to love a silly, completely ridiculous thriller or action film. Preferably, but not restricted to, those starring Ben Affleck.Reindeer Games takes the cake for being one of the most asinine films I've seen this year in terms of plot, twists, and character motives. Characters possess unrealistic, confused ideas, for being such confident criminals, the storyline in itself is a muddle of complete buffoonery, and don't get me started on the twist ending, which is convoluted and almost too ambitious. I'm aware this sounds like the making of a negative review, but damn, I'd be telling an unforgivable lie if I didn't say I got some weird, B-level entertainment out of Reindeer Games. Here's a little diamond in the rough boasting A-list actors, an intriguing little premise, and several settings there are at the mercy of their actors in terms of the way they're utilized.Ben Affleck plays Rudy Duncan, a car-thief currently serving time with Nick Cassidy (Nick Frain), his cellmate. Nick has been writing letters to a woman named Ashley, who is the only person that seems to bring Nick any kind of happiness in life, unlike Rudy who has nothing but basic middle class life to look forward to upon his release. A day before Rudy and Nick's release, a prison uprising results in Nick's death, and realizing that Ashley will now be left alone, he decides to assume the identity of Nick in order to at least have some affectionate love, a caring soul, and some great, if violent, sex upon his release.Arming himself with the knowledge he has gained from Nick's letters to Ashley, Rudy exits prison with the adopted personality of his former cellmate and meets Ashley (Charlize Theron). It turns out, Ashley's brother Gabriel (Gary Sinise) and three of his friends planned to rob the casino Nick used to work at and utilize him as a source for information regarding the building and the whereabouts of the casino's safe. Ashley confesses to Nick (Rudy) that she wrote to him with this in mind, and despite Rudy imploring that he isn't Nick and faked this entire thing to earn the company of Ashley, he is forced to go along with the robbery at hand.For starters, Gabriel and his thugs are some of the most listless robbers in movie history. They have a vague plan, they have little intelligence on their side, and they are often blocked by their own pitiful ineptitude. This is noticeable immediately after Rudy confesses he is not Nick. They don't believe him but threaten to kill him. Then Rudy says he is Nick. Then he isn't Nick. This goes back and forth for about five minutes in a confusing manner, so that we can't even be truly certain how the robbers plan to justify that he is Nick (or isn't).But such things like this become in the back of our minds when we see the craziness the film continues to release. Consider what Rudy looks forward to upon getting out of prison (six months of eating nothing but leftovers among other things he states in a corny monologue the film begins with and ends with). But when he agrees to help Gabriel and his band of goons, what does he request? Some goddamn hot chocolate and some pecan f****** pie. You couldn't find a better line in this film (although Gabriel referring to Rudy's stalling as reindeer games comes pretty close).Besides the film utilizing intriguing settings, such as a large hotel and a spacious casino, with a nice sense of placement and activity, the film can be known for having some at least above average performances, particularly from Gary Sinise. Sinise works as a menacing villain, somewhat reminiscent of a Steve Buscemi kind of character with the straggly hair and the intimidating grimace. Affleck and Theron, for a brief time at least, have solid chemistry, even if their sex is more violence than sensual. Then there's appearances by Isaac Hayes (in a role stranger than the sex-obsessed, dirty-minded chef in a school cafeteria) and Danny Trejo that can guilty bring a smile to someone's face.Reindeer Games is pure entertainment, briskly-paced, constantly moving, and very active in the suspense department. There are noticeable restraints on the material, given the crudely-strung together subject matter and purely ridiculous plot-points in some cases, but there's fun in the film waiting to be had for an absurdly optimistic viewer looking for a supremely different kind of Christmas picture.

He was very young when he made it, one of his earliest experiences and it could be a good film if his head was in the game, by that I mean if he managed to mix surrealism with a concrete text, including his political criticisms and a bit of fantasy and allegory. Buñuel could do it perfectly. But this isn't Buñuel doing an allegedly political allegory on Nazism or Fascism disguised as a empty story involving revolted dwarfs. This is Herzog going completely nuts with something that leads to nothing. Even Dwarfs Started Small revolves a strange dwarf revolution that goes erratically bad when angry dwarfs take control of a little island controlled by one police officer (also a midget) who arrested one of the revolution leaders, leaving him tied to a chair. The latter doesn't worried, always laughing and never speaking with his captor while his friends are vandalizing in the streets, driving cars, hurting animals and placing a strange hierarchy between themselves. The riot drags on and on as the movie, without a single worthy dialog, scenes played on randomly and with a theme song (played like four or five times during the whole thing) working as a violation of our patience and senses, and no ways of being translated whatever that language was.It lacks in coherence time and time again. Where's the drive to make us going? Where's the ambition and the social commentary? If this was a comedy, I didn't laugh once. An horror film? Well, it was so horrific I couldn't believe in my eyes.

Ellie Wallach gives you a delicious portrayal of cunning and clever Tuco who befriends good guy Blondie in the hope of reaching to the treasure. Lee Van Cleef as bad guy gets less scenes and action but all are done with lots of style. All in all, coming from the old school of western thriller, this one is ageless entertainment. Don't miss any chance of watching it!!

Since then, attempts to launch the movie into a franchise have fizzled out and the movie is now more regarded as a minor cult classic of the era, not that well-known outside of the horror fandom. This is something of a shame because Pumpkinhead really is that good.The tagline referred to the movie as a grim fairy tale. The intentionally fable-tastic tone is used a bit to excuse the script's shortcomings. The story of a group of city kids coming to the country, accidentally killing a poor store owner's son, and the demonic wrath that follows is simple as simple can be. The teens are all, at best, sketchy character types. You've got the Jerk, who's insistence on not taking responsibility for the manslaughter spurns on the carnage. He's got a Little Brother (Moral Alliance Mostly Good.), a Girlfriend (Spunky, just shy of annoying), Christian Girl, Nice Girl, and Nice Guy. Of those last three, Christian Girl is easily the best performed, while the two heroic teens aren't developed much beyond disagreeing with the other characters. It's not completely unreasonable to say that these kids exist just to start the plot off and to get slaughtered.Normally, that would hold the movie back, but there are three major factors that make Pumpkinhead a genuinely good creature feature. First off, Lance Henriksen is given a real starring role. Ed Harley is the heart of the movie. Lance is such a subtle actor in this. He manages to show so much with just his face, a cock of the eye, an upward angle. Though the early scenes between him and the son are brief, they feel genuine. Henriksen prevents hokey lines about being the luckiest dad in the world from sounding contrived. Next to Bishop, it's probably his best performance. The warm, sweet musical score moves this along.As good as Henriksen is, the real star of Pumpkinhead is the monster himself. The film was directed by the late, great Stan Winston, a creature effect artist who I've always loved. His make-up team, the same team that made iconic characters in Aliens, Predator, and The Monster Squad are the ones responsible for Pumpkinhead. It's a great design, a creature reptilian and demonic, humanoid but alien. It doesn't quite fall anywhere on the recognizable animal scale. It looks so amazing. This is why CGI can never top practical creature effects Pumpkinhead looks and moves like a living thing. More then that, it has a personality. The suit actor brings even subtle cues to the monster's personality. He can snarl or have a sinister little smile. He does things like play with a victim's corpse, taunt them, carve a cross in their forehead. This is the same reason why Freddy Krueger and Frankenstein's Monster endure. They are clear, obvious, fully formed personalities. Anyway, I'm rambling but it's fair to say Pumpkinhead is one of my all time favorite movie monsters.Finally, the film simply looks fantastic, a combination of atmospheric shooting and detail oriented set designs. The color is great. The nights are clear and blue. The days are orange and brown, lived in and rural. Every set is lived in. The witch's hut is super atmospheric. The burnt out church is so friggin' cool. A demon appears in the doorway of a ruined church, fog swirling all around the blue night. Classic. The graveyard where Ed Harley digs up the demon feels like walking into another world, especially the giant burial mound. This is Southern Gothic, Hillbilly Noir. A lot of movies and shows have attempted this but few are as successful.The fable tone successfully comes through several times. The opening sequence, of a child seeing something horrible he can't really understand, sets the tone fantastically. The ending brings an ironic, mythic quality to the film. Pumpkinhead is one of those movies I like more every time I see it. It's easy to pick apart the movie's flaws but it's successful qualities are hugely endearing.

The fact that some of the male actors look like they're in their 30s, or that John Travolta's accent is not of this world, hardly matters because the script is so intelligent and the story so easy to get wrapped up in.

She has a good read on the alpha girl bullies, the hangers-on, and the outcasts in her class, but this savviness doesn't make her immune to the occasional and serious miscalculation.
