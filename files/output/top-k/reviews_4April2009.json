Just goes to show you the kind of cast a good script can attract, even for a little film.Little film, big emotions. Marvin's Room is about two sisters who haven't been in touch for 20 years. Diane Keaton is Bessie, the sister who stayed home and took care of her elderly relatives - her father, Marvin (Cronyn), who is bedridden and non-verbal, and her dizzy but sweet Aunt Ruth (Verdon). Meryl Streep is Lee, the sister who got out of Dodge (Dodge being Florida), got married, had kids, got divorced, and is about to get her cosmetology license. When Bessie is diagnosed with leukemia and is told she needs a relative's bone marrow, she calls Lee. Lee packs up the kids and drives to Florida so they can all be tested.The film begins with Lee's son Hank (DiCaprio) burning down the family dwelling and getting arrested. It's an understatement to say he's angry with his mother, blaming her for the divorce. He forms a bond with his Aunt Bessie, and doesn't want to leave. His mother vehemently doesn't want to stay. In their big confrontation, Bessie accuses Lee of being selfish in not staying and sharing the burden of taking care of their family. I took care of my family, Lee reminds her. I had a husband and children, and I never heard from any of you people. This is one of those family dramas that hits home, and with the boomers now in the position of taking care of their parents, it's even more relevant than it was 13 years ago. Each member of the cast gives an honest and realistic performance. As the smoking, no-nonsense, nothing can touch me Lee, Meryl Streep is marvelous. I have to admit that I am not always a fan of hers, only because I can sometimes see her making acting choices. Lee is one role where she just IS the character. Keaton is excellent as the softer, warmer, more nurturing Bessie, who sublimated many of her own dreams. As the rebellious teen, Leonardo DiCaprio gives a wonderful performance as the confused Hank, who discovers family he knew nothing about.There are two sisters, and there are also two brothers - Robert DeNiro, who plays Bessie's doctor, Dr. Wally, and Dan Hedaya, the doctor's slow brother Bob who works in Wally's office. Bob isn't much help, but Wally seems to tolerate him with no problem. He's family, and Wally's responsibility.One scene that really cracked me up - Aunt Ruth loves soap operas, and when we first see her, she's watching a soap opera scene with veteran soap star John Callahan (All My Children) and Kelly Ripa. It's hilarious. I mention it because later on, it comes into play.Jerry Zaks' directing is excellent. Just have a box of tissues nearby. It's a story about a family, with lots of love underneath the problems.

But we still have this to remember him by when he at his best.It's actually not as bad as I thought it was going to be, but it still has a few flaws. Casey Ryback the lowly, lowly cook might be somewhat interesting since he is the only character played by Seagal that has some humanity in him. This is perhaps most evident in the scene when two of his boys are dancing to hip-hop music and you can tell that's apparently enjoying himself and enjoying that his cooks are having fun. And also the scene when he finds out that perhaps his closest friend, the Captain was killed and gives him a proper respectful memorial of him. And you can tell that he's upset by it. So at least we get to see Seagal in another kind of character besides those annoying wooden performances that he usually puts forth.Tommy Lee Jones as William Strannix is another high point of Under Siege, since even though he's a little over-the-top, he doesn't show any shame, embarrassment or awkwardness for acting that way. He delivers his lines perfectly, but because of the material he was given he wasn't really as threatening as Clarence Boddicker of Robocop, The Joker in The Dark Knight or Anton Chigurgh of No Country for Old Men were. But he was still very entertaining to watch and a very realistic psychopath.Gary Busey as Commander Krill is not really as memorable here and his flame was starting to wear out after his great role as Buddy Holly in the 70's. But if you see two names like Jones and Busey as the 2 bad guys in this, then you gotta know that it's worth watching. Busey still manages to put up some tension with Seagal at the beginning when he keeps harassing him and his cooks. Erika Eleniak is absolutely sexy as the damsel in distress in this and makes an unforgettable scene when she pops out of the cake and goes topless for a few seconds, which all those who fantasize about Playboy girls will remember.The action is obviously the high point here, and Seagal delivers some great martial arts as usual. The fistfights the explosions are really great to look at and the sound may have been a a little bit ahead of its time since it was nominated for 2 Oscars related to only the action genre. The knife fight between Ryback and Strannix is one of the better ones I've ever seen thanks to the music and cinematography. And like a said, its basically a rip-off of Die Hard only that it's set in a different place.When you first hear of this film, you might automatically hate it because of Seagal, but give it a chance and its a good way to kill an hour and 40 minutes.

The project which was of such importance, so as to command such an extraordinary burst of enthusiasm and unusual demand, was THE BELLS OF ST. MARY'S (Rainbow Productions\/RKO Radio Pictures, 1845); which the honchos at that Studio wished him to direct.SURPRISINGLY the Paramount 'Suits' said Yes; but there was one condition other than the usual monetary consideration$; that being they wanted to do a story using the Father O'Malley character that would have occurred before the ST. MARY'S Story. In both films the role of the kindly, young Priest and New York Archdiocesan trouble-shooter would be Mr. Bing Crosby.SO IT was decided. RKO would get what they wanted and Paramount would do the story of Father O'Malley's soft sell style of preaching the Gospel of the Lord, while at the same time quietly putting an ailing Parish back on its feet; all without giving himself and his covert mission up to the kindly, but aging Founder-Pastor Father Fitzgibbon (Barry Fitzgerald). The Film Form of the Prequel had been started.THE PROTAGONIST of both of the movies is perhaps the finest characterization that Mr. Crosby has done on the screen. In his Father Charles Chuck O'Malley, he combines the qualities of outstanding singing voice and both a fondness and penchant for playing Baseball; certainly making for an unbeatable and All American combination. WELL FOLKS, that about all that's really to it; as strange as it may seem. It so simple on one hand, yet brilliantly conceived and unveiled right before our eyes. That's where all the fun lies.INASMUCH AS the original story for the RKO ST. MARY'S Project was written by Mr. McCarey (Himself), it was lonely fitting that Leo would make the story for the earlier picture, now titled GOING MY WAY (Paramount, 1944). And so he did; and what a great job he did; for one can really see how Director McCarey knew each and every character, inside and out. Whether a character was big and important to the story, or played a minor part in the story, McCarey made them work and believable.THE INCLUSION of a fine group of Actors in the outstanding Cast played no small part in the success of either movie and the GOING MY WAY crew certainly got things off on solid footing. We were treated to a Cinematic Fest with the line-up including Bing Crosby (Father O'Malley), Barry Fitzgerald (Father Fitzgibbon), Frank McHugh (comic relief as Father Timothy O'Dowd), James Brown, Gene Lockhart, Jean Heather, Porter Hall, Fortunio Bonanova, Ely Maylon and Rise Stevens.THE uncredited players on the under side of the ensemble of players included both Carl 'Alfalfa' Switzer (formerly of the Hal Roach OUR GANG Series) and future BOWERY BOYS leader and substitute for a retired Leo Gorcey, Stanley Clements.ALL OF this sure must have added up to some picture, for GOING MY WAY staged a near sweep of the Oscars that year; taking Best Actor (Bing), Best Supporting Actor (Mr. Fitzgerald), Best Director (McCarey) and Best Picture.THE FILM type of this nature, along with so much of those done by the other Studios (especially Warner Brothers and MGM) served as both a guide and a mirror to large number of Urban Working Poor during this period in our Nation's History. It was then that the great flow of immigrants came to the shores of the United States from highly Catholic countries. First came the Irish and the Germans; being followed in turn by peoples from Eastern and Southern Europe. These groups were chiefly made up of Polish and Italian immigrants and were also highly comprised of Catholics.ALL of these folks mainly settled in the Big Cities and sought employment in the manufacturing centers. There were such great numbers of these people that the Bishops of the Cities found their Dioceses growing to super-size and being designated as Archdioceses. The great populations of faithful led the Archbishops of these great cities to designate an orderly and geographically drawn border for what were in effect Political Subdivisions of their respective Diocese. These were the Parishes with their Churches and Nun manned Grade Schools.IN RELATION to these times, the images that reflected the reality of the Catholic Clergymen of the era rang true. They were that of a time when the Pastor and Assistant Priests were universally the best educated people in the neighborhoods; as such they were a combination of Spiritual Director, Job Counselor and Teacher.THIS WAS still generally true in the Post World War II years for in the 1950's and '60's when this writer experienced education in St. Theodore Grade School.

We were treated to a Cinematic Fest with the line-up including Bing Crosby (Father O'Malley), Barry Fitzgerald (Father Fitzgibbon), Frank McHugh (comic relief as Father Timothy O'Dowd), James Brown, Gene Lockhart, Jean Heather, Porter Hall, Fortunio Bonanova, Ely Maylon and Rise Stevens.THE uncredited players on the under side of the ensemble of players included both Carl 'Alfalfa' Switzer (formerly of the Hal Roach OUR GANG Series) and future BOWERY BOYS leader and substitute for a retired Leo Gorcey, Stanley Clements.ALL OF this sure must have added up to some picture, for GOING MY WAY staged a near sweep of the Oscars that year; taking Best Actor (Bing), Best Supporting Actor (Mr. Fitzgerald), Best Director (McCarey) and Best Picture.THE FILM type of this nature, along with so much of those done by the other Studios (especially Warner Brothers and MGM) served as both a guide and a mirror to large number of Urban Working Poor during this period in our Nation's History. It was then that the great flow of immigrants came to the shores of the United States from highly Catholic countries. First came the Irish and the Germans; being followed in turn by peoples from Eastern and Southern Europe. These groups were chiefly made up of Polish and Italian immigrants and were also highly comprised of Catholics.ALL of these folks mainly settled in the Big Cities and sought employment in the manufacturing centers. There were such great numbers of these people that the Bishops of the Cities found their Dioceses growing to super-size and being designated as Archdioceses. The great populations of faithful led the Archbishops of these great cities to designate an orderly and geographically drawn border for what were in effect Political Subdivisions of their respective Diocese. These were the Parishes with their Churches and Nun manned Grade Schools.IN RELATION to these times, the images that reflected the reality of the Catholic Clergymen of the era rang true. They were that of a time when the Pastor and Assistant Priests were universally the best educated people in the neighborhoods; as such they were a combination of Spiritual Director, Job Counselor and Teacher.THIS WAS still generally true in the Post World War II years for in the 1950's and '60's when this writer experienced education in St. Theodore Grade School. It was here that some of the text books still bore a distinct brand left by those Depression Era and World War II Time films. In our primary school, we had Readers from grades 1 to 4 that were published as the Faith & Freedom Series for Catholic Schools. Titles were stuff such as These Are Our Friends, This Is Our Town, etc.IN THOSE there would invariably be illustrations depicting the fictional local Parish Priests. And these color drawings always bore a certain unmistakable resemblance to three well known men; those being Pat O'Brien, Spencer Tracy and Bing Crosby.WE GUESS that this is a clear case of Life imitating Art which was already imitating Art which had imitated Life. Or something like that, ain't that right, Schultz? POODLE SCHNITZ!!

That's just about the plot of JUMANJI, yet I can go on forever with its visual treats. While the CGI doesn't live up to today standards (not to mention the totally unconvincing CGI monkeys!), but some of them in particular (including the terrific sequences where elephants and rhinos rampage around town and inside the mansion living room) still are eye candy. And, courtesy of director Johnston, there are still well-orchestrated moments of excitement. Stars Hunt and co-star David Alan Grier as a cop having a bad day provide the laughs. Despite some dull moments, which have a very major thing to do with its weak writing department, JUMANJI is still an amiable piece of entertainment.

Goblin gets to do a lot of fighting with Spiderman and also has a good back story, so he is a deep villain.A few complaints.

I obviously don't know what the movie makers were going for, but based on what I see I come to a different conclusion than some other people. First off, Sandy doesn't show any signs of trying to fit in with the Pink Ladies or the cheerleaders or anyone else. She's just nice to everyone and doesn't like conflict. I mean she doesn't quit cheerleading or anything! And smoking was a little different in the 50's and even the 70's, I'm pretty sure - it was so much more common and not such a big deal.

On the contrary, quite obviously. In a way '40's thrillers are all more or less the same but an Hitchcock genre movie is always something special to watch and better and more effective than the usual genre movie from the same time period.The movie begins like so many other genre movies and is slow but steady with its build up. However when you are watching an Hitchcock movie you just know that things are never fully the way they seem and the movie has some surprising twists in its story, even though some of them are obvious because of the now days somewhat outdated way of story-telling within this movie. It's a quite solid story actually and I don't really understand some people's criticism that the story is too far fetched and not credible enough. Especially the movie its last 20 minutes are so are excellent for its genre and time period and are also one of the reason why this movie is better and distinct itself from other genre movies made during the same decade.As you can expect the movie is filled with some trademark Hitchcock moments, in which different and original movie making techniques also play some key roles. The movie has some real memorable moments, of which the dream sequence, designed by Salvador Dalí, is of course the best- and most legendary example. A character on the run is a very often reoccurring element within an Hitchcock movie. However in this movie there is a character who is mainly on the run for himself, as he suffers from amnesia while being haunted by some vague memories about something awful he thinks he has done. This makes the movie also really interesting. It's a thriller with early psychological elements. Also something that would later return in multiple other Hitchcock movies.I was also impressed by the movie its acting. Although I always enjoy a good '40's movie I just also can't deny that its acting by todays standards is simply too over-the-top and emotional. Outdated to put it boldly. However the acting in this movie stands the test of time well and Ingrid Bergman and Gregory Peck really give away some fine performances. It actually was one of Peck's first acting roles and he was still in his late 20's at the time of this production. 2 years later he and Hitchock also did the movie The Paradine Case together, which wasn't a very big success.

On the contrary, quite obviously. In a way '40's thrillers are all more or less the same but an Hitchcock genre movie is always something special to watch and better and more effective than the usual genre movie from the same time period.The movie begins like so many other genre movies and is slow but steady with its build up. However when you are watching an Hitchcock movie you just know that things are never fully the way they seem and the movie has some surprising twists in its story, even though some of them are obvious because of the now days somewhat outdated way of story-telling within this movie. It's a quite solid story actually and I don't really understand some people's criticism that the story is too far fetched and not credible enough. Especially the movie its last 20 minutes are so are excellent for its genre and time period and are also one of the reason why this movie is better and distinct itself from other genre movies made during the same decade.As you can expect the movie is filled with some trademark Hitchcock moments, in which different and original movie making techniques also play some key roles. The movie has some real memorable moments, of which the dream sequence, designed by Salvador Dalí, is of course the best- and most legendary example. A character on the run is a very often reoccurring element within an Hitchcock movie. However in this movie there is a character who is mainly on the run for himself, as he suffers from amnesia while being haunted by some vague memories about something awful he thinks he has done. This makes the movie also really interesting. It's a thriller with early psychological elements. Also something that would later return in multiple other Hitchcock movies.I was also impressed by the movie its acting. Although I always enjoy a good '40's movie I just also can't deny that its acting by todays standards is simply too over-the-top and emotional. Outdated to put it boldly. However the acting in this movie stands the test of time well and Ingrid Bergman and Gregory Peck really give away some fine performances. It actually was one of Peck's first acting roles and he was still in his late 20's at the time of this production. 2 years later he and Hitchock also did the movie The Paradine Case together, which wasn't a very big success.

Cats do not take direction well. On the movie set, they probably spend a lot of time arguing with directors over how to play a scene. If the studio would let them, cats would probably want to direct the movie themselves.That Darn Cat! features the best movie performance ever by a cat. The leading man -- or cat, in this case -- is a crafty Siamese named D.C. (Darn Cat). He is the star of the movie, the one who carries the story. And he does it with suave feline sophistication. (Never mind that several cats played the role of D.C. in making the film. They were *all* good.)D.C. is a smooth operator. Like Bogart, he prowls the back streets of his suburban L.A. neighborhood, the king of his territory, his blue eyes observing everything, his nose to the wind, his mind working out all the angles.Throughout the movie, D.C. is performing tricks and stunts that would make Lassie or Rin-Tin-Tin envious. Take the movie's opening scene. D.C. hops up on a backyard fence, attracting the neighbor's dog, a Scottie, who jumps up and down at the fence, barking furiously, trying to get the cat. Then, D.C. hops down and slips into the yard through a crack in the fence. He strolls casually past the barking, leaping dog, and helps himself to the dog's supper dish. Eventually, the dog turns around. He does a double-take and runs at D.C., who calmly slips out through another crack in the fence.It's a classic Siamese trick! I have *owned* Siamese cats who would pull tricks like that on the neighborhood dogs.One night, when he is out for a stroll, D.C. stumbles into the hideout of two bumbling bank robbers (Frank Gorshin; Neville Brand) who took a female bank teller (Grayson Hall) as a hostage in their last robbery. The bank teller puts her wristwatch around D.C.'s neck with a message for help on the back, and tosses D.C. out the door.When D.C. returns home, his young owner, Patti Randall (Hayley Mills), finds the watch and the message. Patti is smart enough to figure out what has happened, and contacts F.B.I. agent Zeke Kelso (Dean Jones). The following night, the F.B.I. sets up a unique operation to track D.C. through the neighborhood, hoping the cat will lead them back to the bank robbers' hideout.The movie has a genuinely funny script, co-written by Bill Walsh (screenwriter on Mary Poppins) and Gordon and Mildred Gordon, authors of the novel, Undercover Cat, on which the movie was based. I've read the novel, and the Gordons really knew their cats, and how cats relate (or don't relate) to humans.A lot of the humor in the movie comes from D.C. having to deal with non-cat people, especially Agent Kelso, who is allergic to cats. One of the funniest scenes in the movie comes when Kelso has to take D.C.'s paw print, and can't figure out how to fit D.C.'s prints onto the standard FBI fingerprint card. Needless to say, D.C. does not like having his paw printed.Hayley Mills does well in her last role for Disney. As Patti, she projects a kind of eager, Nancy Drew-like enthusiasm when she finds herself embroiled in a mystery. Even when the FBI starts to doubt her theory that D.C. has found the bank robbers, she still persists in her investigation. She knows she is right! Perhaps that's why she is the only human in the film that D.C. puts up with -- he finds her to be of equal intelligence to himself.There are small but ingenious supporting performances in the movie, little gems of character acting. Dorothy Provine plays Patti's older sister, Ingrid, who can't believe the fuss that occurs. Roddy McDowell is Ingrid's snobbish boyfriend. Elsa Lanchester and William Demarest are a pair of squabbling neighbors who know that something is going on next door. And Tom Lowell plays Patti's dopey boyfriend, Canoe, who is obsessed with surfing movies.(Some of the funniest gags in the movie occur late in the film, when Canoe accidentally gets involved in the FBI's trailing of D.C. through the neighborhood.) There are some funny cameos. Ed Wynn plays a nervous shop owner that Patti cons into helping her with the investigation. Iris Adrian has a great scene as a landlady who bullies the two bank robbers. And Richard Deacon has a funny role as a drive-in manager.But again, it is D.C. the cat who really carries the picture. It is the cat who outwits both the FBI and the bad guys, and saves the day at the end of the film. He probably wouldn't even care that Hayley Mills got star billing in the movie. For D.C., the greatest joy would be in the giving of his performance -- for what greater joy is there for a cat than simply the joy of...being a cat? P.S. The sly opening song, written by the Sherman Brothers, and sung by Bobby Darin, sets the tone of D.C.'s character perfectly. It is the most accurate song ever written about the character of a cat.

The set-pieces here are pretty good though, with that scene on the bridge with Haim lighting fireworks on the bridge; I remember that scene from when I was a kid.Silver Bullet, while displaying striking individual scenes gets somewhat bogged down when focusing on the kids here, giving them silly dialogue and rather campy scenes.

The film is a biopic of a brief spell in someone's life who doesn't talk and awful lot; knows nothing to begin with and carries blank expressions on his face as he trudges through his life seemingly oblivious to everything, and yet it's devilishly intriguing whilst acting as healthy ammunition for that old statement films like this just aren't made anymore! The film is supposedly based on a true story, that being of the man who mysteriously turned up in the German town of Nuremburg in 1828 with a note attached to him exclaiming he'd been chained up in a cellar for his whole life. His cell had nothing but straw for a makeshift bed and a toy wooden horse to keep him company. On initial face value, one so cynical might say it sounds like a disastrous idea for a film but on the contrary, for Werner Herzog crafts a tale not necessarily about one man's adaptation to the 'real' world in the form of a town, but more akin to an entire town's adaptation to one man. It takes the town time to get used to the individual; it takes us time to get used to him, which it would with anyone when the lead and title character doesn't really do much, and yet we feel won over by the end.The key is to understanding the young man. He is Kasapar Hauser, played by a man named Bruno Schleinstein who himself, if you trust what you read on the Internet, went through a pretty torrid childhood himself what with being born to a prostitute complete with regular beatings. Schleinstein captures the character really well. The first time we see him, we feel sorry for him as he sits and acts out infantile games in a stone walled cellar. Later on, we don't know whether to laugh, cry or feel a little frightened when he emerges in the town square with a distinct expression on his face and a piece of paper in his hand. Maybe we do all three or maybe we don't do any of them but for sure, by the time the film has finished we will have been tempted to indulge in all three.The villagers act as an interesting ingredient to the film. They are as baffled as we are at the beginning, debating what to do with him and how to, once accepting him, educate him in the sense of transforming him into a human being from a vegetable. Initially, Professor Daumer (Ladengast) is charged with 'curing' him and several reaction and fear tests are carried out but the results are inconclusive. This is revolved around one of the town's few acts of cruelty that they lament upon Kaspar, that being the placing into a freak show at the local circus with other such misfits. They are proud of Kaspar as their freak, leaving him to the end of the show before dramatically revealing him as their prized asset. While the show's other freaks are all unnatural in their own sense, they have little more than gimmick-driven tricks or wacky appearances. Kaspar has a complete aura to him; a tainted history and he feels the most genuine of the lot.But while the film could be read as a progression of one man with no history to him what-so-ever, a 'born as a young adult' scenario, it is the town itself that undergoes a similarly dramatic change. Herzog highlights the error of the town's ways by having Kaspar attempt to run away from the folk following the circus act. It is the beginnings of emotion for Kaspar, a recognition that he may be have been a hermit and a mute, but he can distinguish right and wrong. It's following this, and the realisation that he knows no fear, that Kaspar's born out of nothing ideas challenge the town's ideals and it's here he challenges them and their own way of thinking.Given Kaspar's absolute naivety to the world he's actually inhabiting, his ideas linked to religion and women are rather interesting in the witnessing of them playing out. He represents someone as a free thinker, someone who hadn't grown up being drip-fed ideas to do with the role of women and the importance of religion that the 'state' provide you. Indeed, one elderly woman in the film states that she has 'never really travelled that much' and that 'knitting and cooking' are what she, and the others, are limited to. This saddens Kaspar. Additionally, his refusal to engage in prayer brings to attention some worried opinions about him but the intriguing thing is the introduction of some possible conflict between Kaspar and his aides &#x96; will they forgive him because of his past? Or do they deem him now smart enough and thus, he should follow their ways and beliefs now.By the end, each party give and get enough off of one another. Kaspar contributes more to the town and their overall thinking, as well as overall science, then he'll ever know while it was the town that gave him his voice and his ability for basic theological reasoning in the first place. Herzog has taken a hero, whom doesn't initially have a voice or a mind, has has delivered a quite brilliant tale of realisation and reasoning amidst some fantastic mise-en-scene. Quite a winner.

No one can pin him down and one of his charms is his versatility beautiful, emotional movies like The Straight Story; complex thrillers like Blue Velvet; intriguing mysteries like Twin Peaks. Lost Highway displays the most famous aspect of his style the surreal, nightmarish and the ambiguous.Bill Pullman, in one of his finest performances, plays Fred Madison, a saxophonist who inexplicably kills his wife, Renee (played by the gorgeous Patricia Arquette). What happens next is left to the viewer to decide Fred metamorphoses into young Pete Dayton, a mechanic who hangs around with gangsters and soon meets Alice (also played by Arquette).Is Pete Dayton just a fantasy Fred created before sitting in the electric chair? Is it some afterlife where he can lead a new life? Or is Pete real? Lynch respects his viewers too much to give a straight answer; he must know by now the people who like his movies don't care much about answers and prefer the journey anyway.Throughout this journey through Hell, Lynch is up to his usual tricks of strange set designs and of creaking noises to create tension. Fred's house is a dimly-lit, labyrinthine place where one could lose himself, literally and metaphorically. The scene in which Fred becomes Pete is disturbing but reminiscent of Jacob's Ladder.And then there are the usual Lynch characters; two stand out Mr. Eddy (Robert Loggia), a vicious, suave gangster who steals scenes with his hilarious brutality. And The Mystery Man (a chilling performance by Robert Blake in white make-up), an 'abstraction' as Lynch called it, a being who just moves in and out of the action at crucial moments, never on anyone's side, who seems able to read peoples' soul and induce dread. The spirit of guilt, the Devil, a loon, whatever he is, he's one of Lynch's most unsettling creations, up there with BOB and Frank Booth.All in all, Lost Highway, co-written by Barry Gifford, is one of David Lynch's most interesting movies, a fascinating journey to the human psyche and beyond. Viewers who love the strange and the mysterious can't avoid this movie.
