After months of searching for it at rental stores and libraries, I finally found it and got a chance to see it. As a person who likes the western genre and the Dollars Trilogy I really enjoyed this movie. For starters, Sergio Leone's direction is breathtaking. The shots of the western landscapes are beautiful and so are the intense facial up closes that he uses so often in his other films, particularly during the duels. This builds much tension, even if the outcome may seem predictable. But not only does his directing talents capture such a grand film. Tonino Delli Colli's sweeping cinematography helps plaster the western backgrounds and landscapes. As with the actors, they all add diligence and layers to their characters, making each of them unique and complex. For the first time in a western, the story focuses on a woman, Claudia Cardinale's character. In earlier Sergio Leone films, women are depicted as a stereotype, either as having a heart of gold or as a whore. In a sense, the female lead is both, but she's more than just a three-dimensional figure. She's a character with feelings and emotions, and in which the story revolves around her.Henry Fonda often plays the nice good guy in movies, but he's the exact opposite in this; a ruthless, psychotic killer, who feels no remorse for those he kills. This was an unusual twist for him, but nonetheless, he makes a believable villain. Jason Robards and Charles Bronsan are likewise excellent in their roles as the two gunslinging protagonists. Robards delivers his lines of wisdom and humor fluently and Bronsan makes himself as the man of mystery, like The Man With No Name in the Dollars Trilogy. The difference between the two is that Bronsan's character has a story.Adding more drama to the characters is Ennio Morricone's score. It is very unique, different from the other films he had worked on with Leone. Unlike in The Good, Bad, and the Ugly which was made up of a couple of great themes, his score is solely written for each of the different four lead characters. His music develops moods for each of them as it does in reflecting the story's emotional points such as sorrow, fear, tension, and love. Overall, Once Upon A Time in the West is an excellent western that any Sergio Leone fan or buff of the genre should see. However, the one thing that this movie lacks is the action. Sure, there is some shooting, but not enough to carry a film that's almost three hours. At times, the movie gets boring, but the story and character development make it interesting, so I should not complain.

However, Gibson also directed and co-produced that film, whereas his only part in The Patriot was the starring role. Anyway, I learned lot about this movie, reading both praise and criticism, before I rented it just yesterday. From what I had read about it, I could have been reasonably impressed, I could have been somewhat disgusted, but for me, it turned out to be somewhere in between.Set in South Carolina in 1776, during the American Revolution, Benjamin Martin was a hero in the French and Indian War, and now lives as a farmer. He is still deeply tormented by some of his actions during his past experience in battle, and wants nothing to do with the war against Britain. When South Carolina enters the war, Benjamin's eldest son, Gabriel, quickly signs up to participate, without his father's approval. However, Gabriel eventually returns home wounded one night, and soon after this, the cruel Colonel William Tavington, from the British side, captures him and plans to have him hanged! When Thomas, another son of Benjamin, tries to free his brother, he is soon killed, and the house is burned down by British forces! After this, Benjamin finally decides to join the fight against the British, leading a militia into battle for the sake of his country.One thing many people bash this movie for is historical inaccuracy, saying the vast majority of it is fiction. I'm no history buff, but I can believe that. It seems clear that it's filled with fictional characters, including our hero. However, I tend to find that any film I see based on historical events, no matter how popular it is, I'm bound to learn about significant use of fiction in it, so that's not my main complaint. What are my main complaints? Well, first of all, the beginning seems a tad sudden, and probably could have used more of an opening narration to introduce the characters and setting. Those who watch it with no clue what the story is about beforehand could easily find themselves lost around the beginning. Before I watched the film, I read about it being very one-sided, and that's definitely true. Basically, the story is saints vs. savages. I'm sure a lot of brutality came from the British side, but that doesn't mean every single one of them was equally bad and nobody who fought on the American side ever did anything wrong. When historical films are made, inaccuracy seems inevitable, but when the story is this simple, it can be a problem. I did find tension in this film, and some parts are supposed to be moving, but I didn't find them as much so as they're supposed to be, such as Benjamin's youngest daughter, Susan, suddenly begging him not to go as he's leaving to fight, after hating him and refusing to talk to him. Scenes like this seem thrown in just to play with one's emotions, without much effort. I guess another example of this is a scene where British forces lock innocent townspeople in a church and burn it down, which apparently didn't actually happen. The Nazis did this in World War II, but if such an event didn't take place during the American Revolution, then the church-burning scene in this movie is useless. Yes, it may bring out emotions in viewers, but what for? I will also point out that the film is long at over 2 1\/2 hours, and may drag at times, an example being the tedious battle sequence towards the end.I certainly can't exactly say I was bored the entire time when I watched The Patriot, with quite a bit of tension and perhaps some mildly heart-wrenching moments, but overall, I found the feelings the film gave me to be worthless, as it was probably just trying to get the best of me. Also, late in the film, although it may have been hard to turn it off early, for me it was like, When is this going to end? I knew why some have been absolutely revolted by this action blockbuster before I saw it, and after seeing it, I'm not part of that crowd (I'm pretty much indifferent to the film, I guess), but I can understand the points of these people, and I guess I can understand the praise for it as well (after all, much worse has been done). If you want a long melodrama, The Patriot might do, but if you want a deep story with moments that could stir your emotions for a good reason, you could feel cheated by this film.

Event Horizon is definitely gives their argument some backbone. Here is one of the most acclaimed and said to be the scariest movies among horror fans, but when I watched it all I could do is chuckle. Event Horizon is cheese horror, and here is why - The casting is horrible. The characters are not only all clichés, but they're clichés who can't act. They say some of the stupidest lines in the history of cinema&#151;like, Look, a corpse-sickle!&#151;and then act as if they've said the most intelligent thing ever. It's ridicules.- The entire movie is filled with melodramatic scenes. Something bad will happen, then it's accompanied by a laughing man imitating Dr. Evil&#151;and everyone still takes him seriously. One of the absolute cheesiest lines is, Once you're evil, you don't need eyes . . . as Dr. Evil-wannabe cackles in his chair. Sorry, I didn't know I was watching a comedy.- There is no atmosphere, tension, suspense, or terror. The movie jumps strait from the opening to the scenes that are supposed to be scary, but never gives you any suspense or atmosphere. The ship is so abstract it looks like one of those play places at McDonalds or something, not a bearer of doom that the movie expects you to think of it as.- Why does EVERY sci-fi movie have to rip-off Medline L'Engle's book A Wrinkle In Time, then think it's the first movie to come up with the idea?

From the beginning it reminded me quite a bit of a certain Coen brothers film with a similar title, only it is much more violent and a little darker.For those of you who haven't seen it, and to sum it up without spoilers, it's basically a movie about two brothers- Keanu Reeves, the petty crook who has a habit of holding up convenience stores (again, remind you of anything?), and D'Onofrio, his jerky brother. If I got everything right, D'Onofrio does accounting for a dope dealer\/club owner who gives him this girl (Diaz, not exactly stellar in this role) as a wife as a reward for him for finding money she stole and as a punishment for her (again, he's a jerk). Reeves pretty much steals her away from D'Onofrio, and D'Onofrio isn't havin' none of that.The best thing about this movie is the weird sense of humor- it's rather subtle sometimes, and then out of nowhere there will be goofy physical comedy (the only thing Reeves excelled at in this, oddly enough) and weird situational humor. The tone is fairly dark through most of it, but there are plenty of hilarious scenes (however odd they are).This might be my favorite D'Onofrio movie (I'm a big fan of the man), especially for how over-the-top he was in it and for all of the goofy outfits he wore. There are a bunch of scenes where he and Reeves are stumbling around or beating each other up and the nearly slapstick physical comedy was great.D'Onofrio and Aykroyd especially are great as the whiny, violent brother with a bizarre taste in clothes and the crooked cop with the hots for Diaz. Reeves wasn't the best choice, though he's passable (especially in scenes involving sibling rivalry), but the rest of the cast wasn't exactly delightful.The sex scenes between Reeves and Diaz (again, not exactly my two favorite performers) were pretty awful, there were parts of the ending that I didn't like, and I wish the film had omitted some of the more annoying romantic elements in general, but I really enjoyed it overall.It's certainly something I'd recommend, though it's a little odd and very dark (pretty much all of the characters are simultaneously likable and disgusting), so it may not be for everyone ","genre":null},{"date":"21 September 2008","score":"","review":" Feeling Minnesota is an entertaining movie, and though it may require some rewatching to be sure, it's probably now one of my favorites.

It is a black and white classic chock full of vintage cars, clothing, mixed drinks, and scenes so calculated you can hear the clockwork go tick tock tick tock. Its implausible premise an obnoxious heir, Bruno Antony, (Robert Walker) meets Guy Haines, (Farley Granger) a tennis pro, on a train, and without so much as a how-do-you-do, tells Guy that he wants Guy to murder his, Bruno's, father. In exchange, Bruno will murder Guy's wife so that Guy can marry his hot girlfriend, the senator's daughter, Anne Morton (Ruth Roman). Guy's personal life is known to Bruno because Guy is a sports celebrity.In real life, of course, anyone with a three digit IQ would simply say to Bruno the madman, Excuse me, stand up, and walk away. Guy does not, and the movie never offers any interesting reason why Guy loyally sticks by Bruno, as if they were old army buddies and Bruno had once saved Guy's life. This total lack of any plausibility makes the movie boring for the viewer seeking insight into human behavior.Hitchcock's films are always implausible. No one believes that Cary Grant and Eva Marie Saint could really walk across the faces on Mount Rushmore, as they did in North by Northwest. As Hitchcock liked to point out, North by Northwest isn't even a real compass point. The whole point of that movie was not to tell a real story, but to put a very handsome and charismatic star, Cary Grant, in tension-inducing settings, none of which you can ever really believe, but all of which you can enjoy.With Strangers on a Train, though, Hitchcock's signature implausibility and style are there, but there's nothing enjoyable to watch on screen &#150; unless &#150; and it is a big unless &#150; you are a misanthrope and a misogynist who harbors murderous tendencies and finds people too stupid to be endured. If you can identify with Bruno, and if you like to fantasize about killing people, and if you think that other people are so stupid that they deserve to be murdered by you, and that they aren't smart enough to realize what you are up to, I think this might be your favorite movie. Guy's complete idiocy would strike you as convincing. That Bruno can all but strangle to death an idiotically smiling and nodding society matron at a black-tie party just a short while after he strangled Guy's wife in an amusement park, a murder that has not yet been solved, and that no police would arrest, or even interrogate Bruno after he strangled this matron, in full view of the important people in town, would strike you as completely believable.The fun for Strangers on a Train's fans is watching Bad Boy Bruno do bad things and in watching the rest of the population let Bruno get away with doing bad things, because they are too stupid or too passive or too lazy or too bewitched to intervene. You have to have a very dim view of humanity to find that convincing, or even a good time.An unexpected pleasure in the film Ruth Roman. Ruth Roman's celebrity has not outlasted her career; even fans of Golden Age movies are unlikely to worship at her shrine, selecting more obvious goddesses like Bette, Joan, Katharine, Greta, or Marilyn.

A few James Bond films had been made starring then (and now, I suppose) icon Sean Connery. Enter The Ipcress File and everyday, likable Englishman Michael Caine with his studio's attempt to cash in on the craze in genre, either that or they didn't like Bond not being English and tried to make an alternative for other would-be fans. I may not have been around back in the day but judging from a few documentaries I've seen over the years as well as those still images of people queuing around the block to see Goldfinger, The Ipcress File was an attempt to cash in on this new secret agent genre. It was clearly popular.Sadly, viewing the film now as an individual piece and nothing more connected with anything else, it comes across as dead air; a splash in film history's ocean. The Ipcress File begins with something the Bond films also began with an opening action sequence or large scale event that connects the rest of the film, in this case it's the death of some kind of scientist (we can tell because of the magazine he's reading). Then comes the agent himself, our protagonist for the film Harry Palmer, as an early Michael Caine role. The thing here is The Ipcress File borders on the parody; not having Palmer already on some secret mission or in an exotic location or with a woman creates realism for his character and makes the character of Bond and his actions broad. Palmer wakes up; gets up; switches off the alarm clock and makes coffee &#150; a far cry from most Bond introductions which would go on to involve explosions, girls and the rest for its mere introduction.But any good to come out of The Ipcress File pretty much stops here and it sort of sends out the wrong message in the first place. I got a counter-balancing feeling when watching the film, a film that begins with a clear statement of emphasis on realism but will fall into the espionage genre anyway; a film with secret agents but will go about things low-key and somewhat mute. Is it possible to approach the vast and, above all, exciting subjects like espionage and secret agents in a low-key and mute fashion? Probably, but will it be as interesting? Going by how The Ipcress File turned out, 'not really' is the answer.The Ipcress File follows on from its lead character introduction by giving us Palmer's place of work, an office. But again it's having a swipe at Bond. This isn't some fancy, exquisite office with pretty walls; houseplants and posh wooden furniture, oh-no, this is a drab and dreary office with colourless walls and people with real names instead of 'Moneypenny' and 'M'.So we get the idea The Ipcress File is trying to humanise a caricature; a caricature that exists within genres associated with escapism but if anything, it grates after a while. The trouble with The Ipcress File is its dull and unimaginative look, feel and general story twinned with the distinct lack of conflict. Rather than follow what most detective stories do by progressing the narrative with a clue in a scene in a causality driven style, The Ipcress File has its hero organise botched raids; it has its hero distracted by an American agent who appears just as quickly as he disappears before changing its tack completely and turning into something that has our hero look as if he's being framed.In The Ipcress File, everybody dresses the same; everybody looks the same and everybody talks the same, frequently in an annoying coded manner that frustrates more than it does get anything done. Caine as an actor cannot deliver an interesting performance because the character of Palmer is so flat and uninteresting bar the 'break away' ideation (in which credit goes to the screenwriter) that it's often painful to watch. Palmer spends his time organising botched raids; sleeping around and spends too much time in the office although he is conveniently placed just when the script needs a 'Eureka' moment. There is a scene that captures the monotony The Ipcress File slips into in a public park, at a bandstand, Palmer and another individual sit watching a brass band but when an important conversation arises, it is the other individual that delivers all the necessary dialogue as things progress. Palmer can only sit and remain passive as things are done.This scene sums things up for me; the lead character is relegated to staying in the background as matters are either taken care of or presented, much like the break away secret agent image ideation. I want to see Palmer away from the suits and offices, solving the mystery and cracking the case and it doesn't help later on when the bad guys cannot decide on whether they want him dead thanks to shooting the driver of his car or alive for the hypnosis torture they eventually put him through any way.

In the end, he tells viewers through Joan's visible conscience (portrayed by Dustin Hoffman) that her voices were the product of hysteria and that the Messenger from God simply told her what she wanted to hear. To make this approach credible, Besson introduces the murder and subsequent rape of Joan's elder sister, which she witnesses when she is 10 years old through cracks in the door to the closest where she is hiding. Hysteria is a modern and plausible explanation for religious visions, but there is no historical evidence to serve as background -- and I found the modern day psycho-babble more than a little jarring, even though Dustin Hoffman does his best with the role. Fay Dunaway also performs very effectively but John Malkovich is John Malkovich, not the Dauphin.

It's an intense psychological thriller with a phenomenal cast and some of the most memorable characters\/scenes in cinema. Based on the novel by Thomas Harris, the film follows Clarice Starling, an FBI trainee who has been pulled on to assist in a case by the head of the FBI Behavioral Sciences division. Starling must interview incarcerated serial killer Hannibal Lecter in an attempt to help capture a new killer who has risen up and killed three women for their skin. Of course, this movie is legendary, so I'm sure everyone knows this much already...Demme's film, while not the first to feature the character of Hannibal Lecter, is what turned the psychopath into one of the greatest movie villains ever created. Most of the credit for this can be attributed to Anthony Hopkins portrayal of the evil genius. The character is charismatic and frightening, all at the same time, so you can't help but like him despite the terrible things he's done. Lecter is a film icon due to Hopkins' performance. The best scenes in the film are any that include conversations between Lecter and Starling (Jodie Foster). They make every other scene in the movie (including the primary plot) seem insignificant and I found myself waiting for the next interview scene. Foster was great as the naive FBI agent-in-training who is thrown into the fire for her first real assignment and Scott Glenn gave a strong performance Jack Crawford, head of Behavioral Sciences. Aside from Hopkins, I'd have to say the best performance came from Ted Levine as Jame Buffalo Bill Gumb. Perhaps I am just easily entertained by sociopaths but watching him as the severely disturbed Gumb still gives me the creeps.I wouldn't say I was ever really scared by this movie, so I wouldn't classify it as horror. It was more a sense of uneasiness from the film's two resident psychos Hopkins and Levine. It gives you a minor glimpse of the mind of a serial killer and it does it effectively, thanks to the writings of Thomas Harris and Ted Tally. Despite having been released in 1991, the film is timeless and continues to stand today as one of the best movies I've ever seen. Honestly, if you're reading this and haven't seen this film, do yourself a favor and watch it. You won't regret it.

Most of the credit for this can be attributed to Anthony Hopkins portrayal of the evil genius. The character is charismatic and frightening, all at the same time, so you can't help but like him despite the terrible things he's done. Lecter is a film icon due to Hopkins' performance. The best scenes in the film are any that include conversations between Lecter and Starling (Jodie Foster). They make every other scene in the movie (including the primary plot) seem insignificant and I found myself waiting for the next interview scene. Foster was great as the naive FBI agent-in-training who is thrown into the fire for her first real assignment and Scott Glenn gave a strong performance Jack Crawford, head of Behavioral Sciences. Aside from Hopkins, I'd have to say the best performance came from Ted Levine as Jame Buffalo Bill Gumb. Perhaps I am just easily entertained by sociopaths but watching him as the severely disturbed Gumb still gives me the creeps.I wouldn't say I was ever really scared by this movie, so I wouldn't classify it as horror. It was more a sense of uneasiness from the film's two resident psychos Hopkins and Levine. It gives you a minor glimpse of the mind of a serial killer and it does it effectively, thanks to the writings of Thomas Harris and Ted Tally. Despite having been released in 1991, the film is timeless and continues to stand today as one of the best movies I've ever seen. Honestly, if you're reading this and haven't seen this film, do yourself a favor and watch it. You won't regret it.

However, after lulling me into a false sense of security, the director then delivered a right hook to my jaw, leaving me dazed, confused and with a splitting headache. As melodramatic as that sounds, I really did spend last night with a niggling feeling of discomfort in my brain, as though I'd been unexpectedly betrayed by an old friend. 'The Seven Year Itch (1955)' has the best of intentions, and it showcases sex-icon Marilyn Monroe in one of her most alluring roles, but overall it just doesn't work; by the end of the film, I found myself more than a little exasperated. The screenplay was adapted from George Axelrod's popular 1952 three-act play of the same name, which Wilder apparently liked to such that he prophetically included an allusion to it in his 'Sabrina (1954).' Whether or not film censorship played a role in diluting the director's true vision, all I can say is that I am decidedly disappointed.A stairway to nowhere! I think that's just elegant. So says The Girl (Marilyn Monroe) when she notices the low-budget fashion in which a former-duplex has been converted into two separate apartments. This is exactly how I feel about this film it's a stairway to nowhere. The story starts off with definite promise, as a middle-aged husband (Tom Ewell) says farewell to his beloved family for the summer, and must fight the urge to misbehave in their absence (oh, no, not me!); that means no drinking, no smoking and no women. Oh, what glorious temptations Wilder could have flung in this man's path! Unfortunately, this is where the story's foundations in theatre come into play. Just as the story promises to get interesting, it stumbles into an inescapable rut, and everything suddenly stagnates, the running time prolonged through frustratingly-pointless monologues and imagined conversations. Ewell's neurotic overreacting, funny at first, becomes grating, and I couldn't wait until he rid himself of that so-called Seven Year Itch.That there are shafts of light beaming into this dark tunnel is a welcome reassurance to this keen Wilder fan. The casting of Marilyn Monroe is perfect, bringing a sex appeal that was unrivalled by even the finest beauties of her time. Young, lively and naive, The Girl accepts Richard Sherman's awkward advances as just another daily occurrence, frequently mistaking his obvious lust for simple neighbourly kindness. That imaginative money shot above the New York subway is justly iconic, and probably most fully defines Monroe's screen persona, even though Wilder would utilise her to even greater effect in 'Some Like It Hot (1959)' four years later. Despite my general dissatisfaction with the screenplay, there are, nonetheless, a few great lines of dialogue, many delivered by Oskar Homolka as the straight-shooting psychiatrist Dr. Brubaker (At fifty dollars an hour, all my cases are interesting!). Remarkably, 'The Seven Year Itch' was a considerable box-office success, something I can't quite understand, considering the failure of some of his most impressive pictures. Sorry, Billy &#150; I guess nobody's perfect, after all.

Rodney Dangerfield is Al Czervick, successful realty investor, mixes things up with the characters with his screwball comedy. Chevy Chase is the dry-humored zen golfer.

Michael O'Keefe is the young kid providing the movie some character to get behind, and Cindy Morgan plays Lacey Underall (nice name, right?), the sex comedy aspect of the movie. They meet and play golf. There are fights, bets, gunfire, and explosions.I don't think Caddyshack has aged all that well over time. Sexed up raunchy comedy has just gotten dirtier over the years, leaving most of Caddyshack behind in the dust. The story doesn't flow all too well, trudging along scene by scene and often getting distracted by some other anecdote to tell. Each character seems kind of like they came out of their own comedy and were lumped together for a best of skit. However, some of the more drab and dry comedy, especially coming from Chevy Chase as Ty, but also with the attempts of young Danny to get the Judge's attentions for a future he doesn't even want, not only hold up well but give this movie legs to last a bit longer. I can't say it has all that much rewatchability, though.--PolarisDiB ","genre":null},{"date":"21 September 2008","score":"0 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" I finally got around to seeing this well-known comedy classic.

I can't say that I've had the pleasure of reading it, but I can conclude that it must be an absolute masterpiece. How can I deduce this? Because everyone who has read the novel has hated the film adaptation. And you know what, the film is pretty damn good. Therefore the book must be a perfect read. After viewing the film I immediately came here to read all the praise the movie must have garnered. Boy, was I shocked to find that hardly anyone would call it a success. So I'm going to call it an underrated gem. In this gem you'll find two adventurous young boys, a small town full of shattered dreams, and a mysterious carnival ready to twist those dreams into a shattered reality. Something Wicked is a fantastic coming of age tale with fully realized characters, a great plot with subtext and unspoken elements, and a really good cast to back it all up. I recommend this one wholeheartedly and will have to sit down with the book one evening.

But still this is a good story. At the beginning this movie reminded me some of Sicilian mafia movies, like Goodfelas or something like that. Then it became a prison drama and after that a court drama. This film was very clever made. I liked the direction and acting but it appeared to me that in some scenes the characters of the film were taking to easily everything whats going on to them (a good example would be that rape scene, it didn't seemed that those kids were trying to resist them).
