Night Shyamalan, was overrated; it was good but not that good; it had many holes in the plot. However, when it comes to being overrated, Signs is in a category all by itself.Take away Mel Gibson and replace him with an unknown actor, and this is a B-movie. Take away the popularity of the man who directed it, and this film would have been as easily forgotten as Xtro and Not Like Us. The popularity that Sixth Sense enjoyed gave Signs one hell of a boost. The fact that Signs has a few scary scenes has swindled people into thinking this is a masterpiece when it comes to horror flicks.The movie is about a group of aliens making crop circles around a farmer's cornfield. Later in the film, we find out that these aliens, who so far are behaving like pranksters from outer space, are planning to invade Earth. Apparently making crop circles is their idea of warning people that an attack is coming. Imagine American troops tracing crop circles around Iraqi farms, and you get the picture.One of Signs' scariest moments takes place when a group of kids at a birthday party see an alien walking down the street. The shocking footage is filmed by someone at the birthday party. Horrifying indeed. But if you use a little logic, you immediately realize that the alien is walking around naked and without weapons. So they are planning to invade Earth naked and weaponless? Suddenly bigfoot seems a little scarier, and the aliens in Independence Day, who were dumb enough to not know about antivirus software, seem a lot smarter.Spoilers ahead, and I mean real spoilersEventually the invasion begins. This is the point where an alien breaks into Mel Gibson's farm. Yes, attacking farms is an alien's idea of a planetary war; it seems the aliens are in desperate need of corn. But Mel Gibson and his family are going to fight back. They get in the cellar and lock the door. Apparently these aliens can travel faster than light, but they don't have firearms, and they are afraid of locked, wooden doors.Then, early in the morning, the alien seems to be gone. It seems the alien is afraid of sunlight. When the family, who has been through one hell of an ordeal, turns on the television, they realize that not just one but all of the aliens are gone. Why? Because humans discovered that water can harm them. Yes, water can harm them. Yet they were stupid enough to walk around naked. Imagine a group of nudists hanging around a lava-marinated volcanic eruption, and you get the logic of this.The scariest thing about Signs is the fact that not even movie critics saw all the holes it has.

One of my best friends stared at me incredulously when he heard that I had never seen The Boondock Saints.  Apparently, it's reached cult status.  Well, with all the hype surrounding the movie, I reserved it on Netflix.com and I couldn't wait to receive it in the mail.  Last night, I watched it with a friend.  Ten minutes into the movie, I was so disappointed I wanted to turn it off. But I held in there for the full duration of the movie just so I could write a review about it today.Well, here's the premise two Irish Catholic brothers in South Boston, on an apparent mission from GOD, start killing members of a Russian mafia.  Willem Dafoe, a clever FBI agent, is sent in to investigate but ends up admiring the brothers.  Written and directed by any other person, this story would have been incredible.  Instead, in the hands of Troy Duffy, the story was reduced to the level of a made-for-TV movie.  All the stars in the film overracted.  Yes, unfortunately, even Willem Dafoe.  The most blatant overacting, however, was done by Rocco, the funny man mobster.  He wasn't very funny, though he told one racist joke that drew a chuckle out of me. Besides the overacting, there were horrible cliches I couldn't stomach.  For example, Willem Dafoe is a gay FBI agent.  This was milked for laughs several times during the movie.  At one point, he calls his lover a fag and the bartender at a gay bar a fairy.  Why this was included in the movie is beyond me, especially the scene in the gay bar.  It just didn't fit, but I guess the director found all of this comedic.  Another cliche was the old Irish bartender with Tourette's Syndrome.  In the beginning of the movie, he curses infront of nuns in a hospital.  Yeah, I know, could it get any worst?  I could not stomach this movie.  The comedy was less than mediocre, the story was underdeveloped, the acting was terrible, and the cliches gave me a headache.  I cannot understand the appeal of a movie like this.
