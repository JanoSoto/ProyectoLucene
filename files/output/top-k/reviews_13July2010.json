I have to say, I would have watched this film even if I hadn't heard all these things, about the awards and success, especially as it featured in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die. Basically, it is the 18th Century, old and retired former composer Antonio Salieri (Oscar and Golden Globe winning, and BAFTA nominated F. Murray Abraham) has attempted suicide, and a priest is listening to him recount his past. Salieri tells him the story of his encounters with eccentric music composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Tom Hulce), he adores his music, but his personality is a little less likable for him. Salieri wished to God that he could become the most successful composer, possibly of all time, but he believes his Lord is praising Mozart with this great gift for music, so he is madly jealous. He renounces God and tries to think of ways to stop the run of success for Mozart, but this is hard to do when Emperor Joseph II (Golden Globe nominated Jeffrey Jones) and other connoisseurs are in the way. It is when Mozart goes into frowned upon material for opera that he may be lowering his success rate, e.g. the wrong languages for a certain language story, and less shows and people are watching and listening, it's not that their bad, it's that they are possibly too good. There is finally the point where Mozart collapses with so much stress on his mind making the music and keeping his wife Constanze (Elizabeth Berridge) happy, so Salieri is more than happy to help Mozart finish his possible final piece. In the end, Mozart dies (most likely of fever), and you are left with the idea that it was Salieri praying to his God that killed him, but he was certainly mad enough to be a villain. Also starring Simon Callow as Emanuel Schikaneder, Roy Dotrice as Leopold Mozart, Christine Ebersole as Katerina Cavalieri, Charles Kay as Count Orsini-Rosenberg and Star Wars' Kenny Baker as Parody Commendatore. Abraham is certainly a great villain worthy of awards, and Hulce even though he didn't win is a great counterpart, the supporting cast all have their moments too. I think the main reason I rate it really highly, besides a great cast and story, was the magnificent music, Mozart was definitely the finest music composer of his time, and seeing a biographic drama about him is brilliant. It won the Oscars for Best Picture, Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Costume Design, Best Makeup, Best Sound and Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium, and it was nominated for Best Cinematography and Best Film Editing, it won the BAFTAs for Best Cinematography, Best Editing, Best Make Up Artist and Best Sound, and it was nominated for Best Film, Best Costume Design, Best Production Design and Best Adapted Screenplay, and it won the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama and Best Screenplay.

A stunning work of blazing originality & featuring precision craftsmanship in nearly all departments of filmmaking, Once Upon a Time in the West is western in its purest form that fuses breathtaking art into the legacy of Wild West unlike any other example before or after it.The story revolves around a small chunk of land which is the region's only water source. The family that owns the land is slaughtered by Frank & his gang, after which the ownership transfers to Jill, the widow of the murdered family. At night, she is confronted by Cheyenne, a notorious bandit who is suspected of committing the crime & vows to go after the real killer. Also new in town is a mysterious harmonica-playing gunman who has a personal vendetta to settle with Frank.Sergio Leone earned his reputation as one of cinema's gifted visionaries for his Dollars Trilogy but this film introduces a very mature side of this director & his keen eye for stunning detail, visual narration & cinematic art is noticeable from the opening moments where we see three men waiting at a railway station for someone or something due in the next train. It's a long sequence with no dialogues or action that any other director would've skipped but not Leone. He makes us wait for the inevitable, turning each frame into a visual feast, capturing the boredom of characters reflecting our own impatience & yet effortlessly manages to create an aura of anxiety that ends with sudden violence, thus making it one of cinema's most captivating moments.Cinematography goes beyond capturing the desert landscapes or events on film as it ended up narrating a story of its own. Making use of slow zooms, controlled movements & perfect close-ups, it brilliantly captures the emotions of its complex characters. The pacing is deliberately slow when compared to Leone's previous works but this slowness did amplify the intense moments & steadily immerses us into its raw territory too. And, Ennio Morricone impresses once again by composing an even more haunting soundtrack for this film compared to his previous compositions & it's easily one of his finest works, if not the finest.Coming to the acting department, the movie features an ensemble cast of Henry Fonda, Charles Bronson, Jason Robards & Claudia Cardinale, who all chipped in with strong & genuine performances. Henry Fonda goes against his usual roles & plays the antagonist Frank, the ruthless, murderous psychopath, with zero empathy and delivers an absolutely cold-blooded performance that ranks amongst his best. Jason Robards does well as Cheyenne, the falsely-accused bandit while Charles Bronson impresses as 'Harmonica', whose unfinished business with Frank is revealed magnificently in the final showdown. And last we have Claudia Cardinale making a fine contribution in the company of men.On an overall scale, Once Upon a Time in the West is one epic that shouldn't be missed by any cinema lover, especially the fans of westerns, Sergio Leone or Henry Fonda. Yes, the film is very slow but then, it's very smart as well. It marks the birth of a new style, new approach & striking maturity in Leone's work & creativity and is the most perfect film of his celebrated career. Cementing Leone's name in the annals of cinema, Once Upon a Time in the West is an extremely respected, honoured & significant motion picture masterpiece whose legacy is as classic as Sergio Leone's direction, Ennio Morricone's scores & their legendary, unparalleled combination. In short, Sergio Leone's magnum opus.

They are not in any way part of the story as it is written, but they are figured in visually, through numerous, seemingly arbitrary, inserts. It's an example of what cinema can do for you &#x96; manifest a theme without ever once having to refer to it out loud. With these kids in the picture, director Sam Peckinpah's message is clear &#x96; casual violence involves the innocent bystander.This is, of course, a revisionist Western in a vein that the genre had been following since the late 1950s. Like most such pictures it is an elegiac portrait of a vanishing way of life. But more than any other it is full of the weariness and melancholy of the gunfighter's life, and completely lacking in any nostalgia or romantic homage. Again this is something that is stressed more visually than verbally. There is scarcely any beauty in The Wild Bunch, no inviting landscapes, little dignity to the characters. Although Peckinpah had a hand in writing this picture (along with Walon Green and Roy Sickner), he is a director who likes his own ideas writ large on the screen, and he took enough control over the production to ensure they got there.Like many such Hollywood renegades Peckinpah's pictures have been analysed to death. Inevitably he gets credited with far more than he deserves (especially by those gushing jokers who do his DVD commentaries), but worse still has some of the finer aspects of his talent overlooked. Everyone knows about Peckinpah's rapid editing patterns, which acknowledge just how quickly the human brain can absorb visual information. However, the actual quality of these flashing images is paramount. Peckinpah has really taken care to give each shot a plain and clear focus. In a seemingly random crowd shot the careful orchestration of the movement pulls our eye to whatever we are supposed to notice, be it a gunman rushing forward or a woman lying prone amid the carnage. Peckinpah's compositional style tends very much towards organised chaos.Nevertheless Peckinpah's method is not without its drawbacks. One is that, what with all this speedy cutting, plus the fact that there is little in between gritty close-up and wild group shot, means the acting is not shown up especially well. William Holden gives a great performance here, or seems to, but all we get of it are split-second scowls and sound bites. Robert Ryan looks to be doing a superb job too, but as he is a far more passive character he really merits a bit of meditative focus. We may be able to process a visual message in an instant, but we don't get the emotional weight or full physicality of an acting performance when it is cut up into so many little pieces.But let's face it, Peckinpah never intended his cast to carry the movie. That was a job he strove to take upon himself, and it is indeed difficult to discuss any aspect of the picture without referring back to its director. And so I might as well make the most of it and come round to the most wonderful of Peckinpah's ways &#x96; his approach to action. Any fool with the necessary gadgetry can do a slow motion death (see Keoma, 1976, for example). What's different is the way Peckinpah orchestrates the shots, rhyming similar motions, splitting a slow motion fall between several faster shots, drawing us into the excitement for one second, hitting us with an innocent face the next &#x96; all done with such exquisite timing and arrangement, to remove one facet of it would make the whole thing fall apart. In short, Peckinpah makes violence poetic. Does this contradict his own pacifist intentions? Maybe. But this is good poetry, regardless of its subject.

This being wishes to arrange a meeting with the world leaders to deliver such a message, but cannot seem to do so as these leaders cannot even decide on a location to hold it. He then escapes military custody and goes out into the public to try and understand the human race more, all the while being hunted down by the military.

He also meets a scientist who is organizing a meeting between some of the greatest minds in the world to learn more from this alien and sees this as a perfect opportunity to deliver his message. Unfortunately, I don't really do justice to the plot but it is actually pretty good.My main problem with this film is the alien and his companion, a giant robot. The alien, named Klaatu, is literally a man dressed up in a shiny jumpsuit. Even when they examine him, the scientists reveal that there is very little difference in his anatomy to our own. The robot, I believe named Gort, also looks very cheesy. It is hard to think of Klaatu as an alien when he is so similar to a human. I just wish a little more creativity had been applied to the design of him and Gort.The backdrop of the 1950's is great considering this was the height of alien paranoia. Unfortunately, many of the characters come across as flat and stereotypical with the exception of the family which befriends Klaatu. I found almost everyone else in this movie to be detestable.

It was quite possibly the most annoying scene in the entire movie.This movie is built on a very solid premise. The plot and message of the movie are just as good and relevant now as they were in the 1950s, if not more so today.

The film was dedicated to him. It seems therefore that he did not live to see it, despite it being based on the book he wrote about his childhood memories with his dog Skip. Morris (1934-1999) came from Jackson, Mississippi, and wrote two books of childhood memoirs, MY DOG SKIP and GOOD OLD BOY A DELTA BOYHOOD. The 'Delta' referred to is the Mississippi Delta, a region made internationally famous by the classic novel by Eudora Welty, DELTA WEDDING, which is one of the greatest works of fiction ever to come out of the American Deep South. The film itself is transposed to Yazoo, Mississippi, for some reason, and some characters are changed or invented. The main theme of this story is of a lonely boy whose best friend becomes his dog. But it is interwoven with many simultaneous adult and childhood events and tragedies, so that a rich texture of life in the town is evoked and portrayed. It is very true to the pattern of small Southern towns as they used to be, with a boy's dog becoming a well-known member of the community who could be greeted heartily on the street as he trotted along. In this film, perfectly accurately, we see townspeople greeting Skip as he passes them, or saying 'There goes Willie's dog Skip,' as if they were speaking of a person. There is one hilarious scene where Willie and his mother put Skip at the wheel of their car and the mother drives the car down Main Street while lying out of sight on the seat, so that everyone gasps with astonishment at the sight of seeing a terrier drive a car. Skip keeps his eyes on the road and the wheel and does not look to right nor left. Such things were common occurrences in such towns back in those days, and right up until the 1960s. After that, the small towns all over America were gutted by shopping malls, spreading suburban blight, and above all by the interstate highway system. All the small communities were destroyed overnight, and so stories like this one are now of archaeological interest. I grew up in a small Southern town and my dog, who was my best friend, was known by most of the people in the town and greeted in the street as if she were a person, exactly as shown in this film. Furthermore, my adult friend Sarah V. Thacker used to drive up and down Main Street with her pet pig sitting up on the front seat beside her. All of these things are absolutely what happened back then, but are as inconceivable now as if 1000 years had passed rather than just 50 years. Being a child when there was no meaningful TV, no internet, no cell phones, in an isolated small town full of colourful characters, and where you could wander round at any time of day or night with your dog, where no one ever locked his house or his car and not a single burglary or theft had occurred in more than 100 years, was in many ways delightful. All the nostalgia for such small town life is justified. I say that for the younger people who have never experienced it and cannot possibly imagine it. It was also a time before drugs, and before the mass commercialization of sex. In fact, it was quite literally a time of innocence. There were no murders, no rapes, no muggings, no burglaries, no car thefts, no school shootings, no drug addicts, and no one ever worried about a little child wandering around the town at any hour because nothing could possibly happen to him other than maybe tripping in the dark and hurting his knee. This vanished world, set in the 1940s and hence before my own time, is miraculously recreated in this film. The casting is superb. The little boy Frankie Muniz plays Willie Morris with perfect charm, and is just right. Luke Wilson is excellent as the student sports hero Dink Jenkins who lives next door. (My student sports hero was named Kermit Lance (who alas died young), who treated me with the same gentle and friendly consideration shown here by Dink.) Kevin Bacon is excellent as the tormented father who has lost his leg in battle, and Diane Lane is just as good as his mother. Caitlin Wachs is perfect as 'the prettiest little girl in town' who becomes sweet on Willie. The other kids are excellent. There are some excellent performances by the minor characters who, being black, are relegated to the background of the story because they lived in a different part of town in those days of racial segregation. One is the young actor Nathaniel Lee Jr. Another whose name I don't know played the man who worked in the grocery store and gave slices of 'baloney' to Skip. The black inhabitants of the small Southern towns were important figures in its composition in those days, but were as confined to their social circles in their private lives as many of the immigrant Hispanics and Muslims are today. The segregation was not entirely forced, for there is always a tendency for any minority to prefer a ghettoized social life, as we see today more than ever. At one point in the film we see a film being screened and catch a glimpse of the black children being confined to the balcony while the white children sit in the stalls below. In another scene we see the black people filing up the fire escape stairs at the side of the cinema to enter the balcony.

The 'Delta' referred to is the Mississippi Delta, a region made internationally famous by the classic novel by Eudora Welty, DELTA WEDDING, which is one of the greatest works of fiction ever to come out of the American Deep South. The film itself is transposed to Yazoo, Mississippi, for some reason, and some characters are changed or invented. The main theme of this story is of a lonely boy whose best friend becomes his dog. But it is interwoven with many simultaneous adult and childhood events and tragedies, so that a rich texture of life in the town is evoked and portrayed. It is very true to the pattern of small Southern towns as they used to be, with a boy's dog becoming a well-known member of the community who could be greeted heartily on the street as he trotted along. In this film, perfectly accurately, we see townspeople greeting Skip as he passes them, or saying 'There goes Willie's dog Skip,' as if they were speaking of a person. There is one hilarious scene where Willie and his mother put Skip at the wheel of their car and the mother drives the car down Main Street while lying out of sight on the seat, so that everyone gasps with astonishment at the sight of seeing a terrier drive a car. Skip keeps his eyes on the road and the wheel and does not look to right nor left. Such things were common occurrences in such towns back in those days, and right up until the 1960s. After that, the small towns all over America were gutted by shopping malls, spreading suburban blight, and above all by the interstate highway system. All the small communities were destroyed overnight, and so stories like this one are now of archaeological interest. I grew up in a small Southern town and my dog, who was my best friend, was known by most of the people in the town and greeted in the street as if she were a person, exactly as shown in this film. Furthermore, my adult friend Sarah V. Thacker used to drive up and down Main Street with her pet pig sitting up on the front seat beside her. All of these things are absolutely what happened back then, but are as inconceivable now as if 1000 years had passed rather than just 50 years. Being a child when there was no meaningful TV, no internet, no cell phones, in an isolated small town full of colourful characters, and where you could wander round at any time of day or night with your dog, where no one ever locked his house or his car and not a single burglary or theft had occurred in more than 100 years, was in many ways delightful. All the nostalgia for such small town life is justified. I say that for the younger people who have never experienced it and cannot possibly imagine it. It was also a time before drugs, and before the mass commercialization of sex. In fact, it was quite literally a time of innocence. There were no murders, no rapes, no muggings, no burglaries, no car thefts, no school shootings, no drug addicts, and no one ever worried about a little child wandering around the town at any hour because nothing could possibly happen to him other than maybe tripping in the dark and hurting his knee. This vanished world, set in the 1940s and hence before my own time, is miraculously recreated in this film. The casting is superb. The little boy Frankie Muniz plays Willie Morris with perfect charm, and is just right. Luke Wilson is excellent as the student sports hero Dink Jenkins who lives next door. (My student sports hero was named Kermit Lance (who alas died young), who treated me with the same gentle and friendly consideration shown here by Dink.) Kevin Bacon is excellent as the tormented father who has lost his leg in battle, and Diane Lane is just as good as his mother. Caitlin Wachs is perfect as 'the prettiest little girl in town' who becomes sweet on Willie. The other kids are excellent. There are some excellent performances by the minor characters who, being black, are relegated to the background of the story because they lived in a different part of town in those days of racial segregation. One is the young actor Nathaniel Lee Jr. Another whose name I don't know played the man who worked in the grocery store and gave slices of 'baloney' to Skip. The black inhabitants of the small Southern towns were important figures in its composition in those days, but were as confined to their social circles in their private lives as many of the immigrant Hispanics and Muslims are today. The segregation was not entirely forced, for there is always a tendency for any minority to prefer a ghettoized social life, as we see today more than ever. At one point in the film we see a film being screened and catch a glimpse of the black children being confined to the balcony while the white children sit in the stalls below. In another scene we see the black people filing up the fire escape stairs at the side of the cinema to enter the balcony. These segregation details are not highlighted in the film at all, but are there for the sake of social accuracy. How well I remember the ridiculous four rest rooms in every bus station!

My reason for wanting to hate it is because on the outside it appears to be a story about a really shallow guy (who has ZERO right to be shallow) learning a lesson about inner beauty and not being Shallow and yet beginning to end the film still manages to be entirely shallow. Everything is done in overboard enormity for Shallow Hal making everything seem silly and overblown. So after all this being said I couldn't bring myself to hate any of it really. As shallow as Hal and the rest of the movie is, somehow you find yourself smiling, and enjoying watching Jack Black make a fool of himself. I don't believe Shallow Hal is actually trying to truly teach any sort of moral message but rather just being rude and funny and silly while perhaps mocking the moral message? I certainly would never watch Shallow Hal with any youngsters of even impressionable teenagers but for an adult comedy you might just find yourself falling in love with feeble minded, but well meaning Hal.I'm sure the amount of variant opinions of Jack Black could fill a small Island in the Pacific but I am usually a fan of his performances. He is always silly, always slapstick, and always entertaining. He is about as serious as Jack Black gets in Shallow Hal and he pulls off the role well. Gwyneth Paltrow is really terrific as the over-sized Rosemary but she also has an over-sized heart. Paltrow as Rosemary is sugary sweet and her and Black have a funny and sweet relationship although it certainly doesn't paint Rosemary (the heavier one) in a very good light. Jason Alexander plays Black's best friend and as much as I think Alexander is a talented performer his role in this film is simply unlikable. He is incredibly shallow, and barely likable but maybe that is the point I don't know. Still this isn't his best character for sure. A host of really amazing cameo supporting characters make the film even more fun including Joe Viterelli as Rosemary's Dad, Tony Robbins as himself, and Zen Gesner in some of the stronger roles.If you really wonder what Shallow Hal is like all you have to do is look at directors The Farrelly Brothers. Their comedy is at the height of crude humour with sort of a Family Guy like quality to their stories. Shallow Hal is all about fat jokes, mistaken identities and Jack Black looking silly which might not work under all circumstances but somehow Shallow Hal makes it work. I can promise you that someone who is self conscious or sensitive about types of humour will not appreciate Shallow Hal but when all is said and done there is a happy ending and a seemingly romantic ending so it might be enough to appease the critics of the content but until then it is just entertaining and nothing more.

It is pure garbage. I would use different words to describe how awful it is, but IMDb does not permit the use of such words that I would give to this atrocious piece of junk. The film reel that holds this film would be better used spinning in a toilet bowl than on a movie projector.So why is this film that bad? You can tell right in the first scene. It shows Malcolm McDowell playfully chasing a very pretty girl through a forest. Not only is the shot out of focus, but the editor somehow felt it appropriate to intersperse this scene with footage of sheep running through a crowded street. Why? What do these sheep even have to do with this scene? It's not even metaphoric. It would be if it showed McDowell speaking to a large crowd of people who are influenced by his words. This way, the metaphor would be that the Romans are like sheep blindly following their leader. However, that is not at all what happens at any point in the film.In fact, no one in this film seems to take McDowell's character of Caligula seriously. McDowell, who I loved in A Clockwork Orange (1971) and other films, plays the Roman Emperor in a one-note performance that seems to undermine his acting ability. Caligula in this movie is a whiny brat of an emperor who seems to do four things fornicate, flout about wearing no pants, send people to be executed at random, or elevate his status from Emperor to God. I don't know much about Roman history myself, or at least not about Emperors after Marcus Aurelius. However, the real Caligula must have had more complexity than this.There are other great thespians in this movie who, according to what I've read, played their parts while not knowing the mess they were getting into. Peter O'Toole did what he could playing Tiberius, but just seeing the ugly makeup he wore made me want to take a shower and use rubber gloves. That's why I cringed when McDowell and others kissed him on the cheek.Helen Mirren was also wasted in this movie as Caesonia, Caligula's wife who, according to his sister and lover (yes, that's right) Drusilla (Teresa Ann Savoy) is the most promiscuous woman in Rome. Not only do you not see her with other men in this movie, but she also goes through the entire movie looking bored and just going through the motions. I actually don't blame Mirren for feeling that way if she actually did. Fortunately, better roles would come her way in the next 30 years.But again, the biggest weakness of this film comes in the editing. I have not seen a movie before which has sloppier editing, and the flow of the story is completely thrown off because of it. The scene where Caligula first gazes upon Caesonia is followed too abruptly by a man getting his head cut off in a stadium. It goes right from harp-like music playing to a scream and the sound of a sharp knife slicing through bone in a second. Any sane moviegoer would react by saying, Woah! What the hell happened!?! in that second alone. I found myself saying that phrase through the whole movie.Many films have strengths and weaknesses, but this is the first film I've seen where I can't think of any strengths whatsoever. It's sloppy in its editing and storytelling, less than mediocre in its character portrayals, and even the settings and backdrops look too much like movie sets. In fact, the scene where Caesonia is giving birth looks like it was filmed in a high school gymnasium.If someone who actually knew what they were doing would have made this film, it would have been a lot better. What is most surprising is that the film is gaining an audience with the most recent DVD release.

I would use different words to describe how awful it is, but IMDb does not permit the use of such words that I would give to this atrocious piece of junk. The film reel that holds this film would be better used spinning in a toilet bowl than on a movie projector.So why is this film that bad? You can tell right in the first scene. It shows Malcolm McDowell playfully chasing a very pretty girl through a forest. Not only is the shot out of focus, but the editor somehow felt it appropriate to intersperse this scene with footage of sheep running through a crowded street. Why? What do these sheep even have to do with this scene? It's not even metaphoric. It would be if it showed McDowell speaking to a large crowd of people who are influenced by his words. This way, the metaphor would be that the Romans are like sheep blindly following their leader. However, that is not at all what happens at any point in the film.In fact, no one in this film seems to take McDowell's character of Caligula seriously. McDowell, who I loved in A Clockwork Orange (1971) and other films, plays the Roman Emperor in a one-note performance that seems to undermine his acting ability. Caligula in this movie is a whiny brat of an emperor who seems to do four things fornicate, flout about wearing no pants, send people to be executed at random, or elevate his status from Emperor to God. I don't know much about Roman history myself, or at least not about Emperors after Marcus Aurelius. However, the real Caligula must have had more complexity than this.There are other great thespians in this movie who, according to what I've read, played their parts while not knowing the mess they were getting into. Peter O'Toole did what he could playing Tiberius, but just seeing the ugly makeup he wore made me want to take a shower and use rubber gloves. That's why I cringed when McDowell and others kissed him on the cheek.Helen Mirren was also wasted in this movie as Caesonia, Caligula's wife who, according to his sister and lover (yes, that's right) Drusilla (Teresa Ann Savoy) is the most promiscuous woman in Rome. Not only do you not see her with other men in this movie, but she also goes through the entire movie looking bored and just going through the motions. I actually don't blame Mirren for feeling that way if she actually did. Fortunately, better roles would come her way in the next 30 years.But again, the biggest weakness of this film comes in the editing.

Sweeping all five of the major Oscar awards including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Actress and Best Screenplay, Jonathan Demme's The Silence of the Lambs is a thriller, a horror, a psychological study into the mind of the serial killer, and a very powerful example of what film can turn out to be when actors, writers and directors are all at the top of their game.Clarice Sterling (Jodie Foster) is a young FBI trainee who is pulled out of training and assigned the case of finding a serial killer named Buffalo Bill. She is sent to the mental institute to gain insight on the character by interviewing another serial killer, the notorious Hannibal Lecter, or Hannibal the Cannibal, played by the great Anthony Hopkins. While Hopkin's gave one of the most chilling and disturbing portrayals I have ever seen, it's Foster's performance that keeps this movie rolling. Clarice has a troubled past, full of fear and repressed memory. Hannibal is the monster she is trying to learn from, but he is not going to give her anything without something in return, in this case, access to her deepest, darkest secrets. The relationship between these two figures is tauntingly fascinating. There's a certain poetry involved here and it's so provoking to watch. Some may call this chemistry, but I think it's just two talented actors with and an equally talented director playing their part, and doing one hell of a job.Despite my gratitude for both actor's performances, if I had to choose which one I'd call my favourite, it would have to be Jodie Foster as Clarice Sterling. I fell in love with Foster after I saw this movie. Every time I think of her now I think of those old-fashioned clothes and burgundy shoes. I think of her amazingly delicate portrayal of a woman haunted by her past yet still trying to save the life of a teenage girl. Which reminds me, one thing that was really nice to see was that it wasn't a man trying to save the day for once, it was a woman. Almost every other Ameircan movie I've seen it's always been a man saving the damsel in distress. There was never a time where a woman got to have the acknowledgment or the parade, and I think Johnathen Demme picked up on this fact and expressed it as another theme to the movie. Close to the start of the film when Clarice was on her way to the office for her assignment, she walked into this elevator and she was surrounded by huge blokes, it made her like the smallest thing ever. It was quite funny, and I think it really said something. Clarice was a woman working in a man's world, guys would often chuckle or question at her presence, and occasionally even sexually harass her in mild ways. Witnessing all this it makes you think that there's something to prove here and that it was going to be interesting to find out how it would manifest into a final ending. Jonathan Demme is probably never going to be able to do something like this ever again. It's possibly my most favourite film ever, but if not it's certainly in my top 3. It's perfectly acted, perfectly written, and perfectly directed. This is a top-notch movie that for me scores a perfect 10 \/ 10, no doubts, no regrets, AWESOME!

Yet, given the pedigree he has provided for himself, particularly with films such as MASH, McCabe & Mrs. Miller, Nashville and 3 Women on his resume, I hold his films to a higher order than most.Perhaps for that reason most of all, I was quite disappointed by this outcome. Jennifer Jason Leigh and Miranda Richardson star as small-time hoodlum and rich politician's wives, respectively, with Leigh taking Richardson hostage in hope that her husband will be released by the notorious gangster Seldom Seen. However, all this is simply a contrivance for what Altman is really after, which seems to me to be the context and feeling of the city of Kansas City in the 1930s when Jean Harlow movies played in the local cinemas and voting was a high-stakes gamble that if gone wrong had very serious consequences.In terms of the film itself, I would consider this film to suffer from the Hudsucker Proxy syndrome it looks fantastic with the sets and costumes all perfectly realizing the era in which it attempts to capture. Yet, the story is almost thrown together with really not attempt to clarify or make known exactly what is happening. I understand this is Altman's style, particularly for this film, but in order to string the movie along and maintain audience interest, it certainly would have helped to include a more cohesive story line. Also, Jennifer Jason Leigh doesn't fit this part in my opinion, coming off more annoying and self-conscious than sympathetic and interestingly quirky.

Perhaps because he grew up in Kansas City in the 1930s or he felt interested in gangsters, jazz and the setting of a growing town prior to World War II.

Jack Benny is an egomaniacal famous actor in Warsaw, and Carole Lombard his unfaithful actress wife, when the Nazis take over Poland in 1939.The plot involves secret information, impersonations, spies, clandestine trips back and forth to England, assignations with Carole Lombard, and -- oh, let me recount how the featured assignation works.Lombard is visited in her dressing room by a young and animated Robert Stack, an bomber pilot in the Polish Air Force. He's been sending her flowers for days and is overwhelmed by her presence. He boasts of his exploits and she melts while listening. When he's leaving, after she agrees to see him again, he tells her he's never met a real actress before. She replies in a throaty voice, I've never met a man who could drop three tons of dynamite in two minutes before. (Lubitsch pulls this stuff off with aplomb.) The agreement is that they will meet again in her dressing room for further conversation, so to speak, during her husband's recital of Hamlet's soliloquy -- To be or not to be, that is the question. Every high school kid knows it because it's perhaps the best-known line that Shakespeare ever wrote.So, we see the performance of Hamlet with Robert Stack in the second row. Jack Benny enters, alone, pauses, closes the book he's holding, and looks up soulfully. It's his great moment. To be . . . or not to be --, he begins, and Stack stands up and shuffles his way noisily out to the aisle to be with Lombard. Benny stops talking and gapes at him.This goes on for several nights in a row. Benny has no idea why the same officer stands up and leaves at the same point in the soliloquy. It's driving him nuts. Finally, with the main plot underway, Benny is unable to perform Hamlet again until the end of the movie, on the English stage. He strolls onto the stage in the same puffed-up manner, folds his book, and begins. To be . . . or not to be? And a British naval officer in the second row shuffles his way out.I don't want to get into this because I'll give away more gags, and the plot is complicated and has several surprises tucked away in it. Sig Rumann gives ample support as a comic Gestapo officer. When the movie first appeared, it was excoriated by some observers who felt that the Nazi conquest of Europe was not in the least fit as a subject for comedy.

Everything is still so linear. &#x96; Robert Altman Altman's technique is so alien, that most viewers automatically dismiss his films as being shoddily put together, which is a shame, because he really is one of the most consistently interesting directors out there.Typically, Altman begins by constructing an environment (military hospital, theatre, rodeo, diner etc), introducing a large cast, inserting some self referential performance within a performance (play, wedding, radio show, etc) and then adopting a style in which the whole cinematic world flows independently of what we see. In other words, his plots seem to unfold even when we don't watch, his camera floating from one nodule to the next, stumbling upon bits and pieces of a story. But the story is itself non-defined, and it's up to us to synthesise the pieces and make it all coherent.The environment in this case is Dallas, Texas, a world which Altman viciously reduces to a set of stereotypes (Altman is always at his most mean-spirited in his supposedly lighter, more comedic movies). This is a cartoon world of gas guzzling, upper class Texans, giant SUVs, vapid students, expensive clothing, Dallas Cowboy Cheerleaders, JFK conspiracy theorists and so forth. Even the film's lead character is cast solely as to allow Altman to exploit Richard Gere's iconography (Gere has made a career out of playing suave womanizers).The film begins with a horde of women bickering in a gynaecologist's reception room. Their voices overlap and overlap until we're left with nothing but annoying static. It's up to Dr. T, a smooth, suave and sexy gynaecologist (played by Richard Gere, of course), to untangle all this noise and please his woman, satisfying their needs and fulfilling their various emotional problems.The very next scene works as a counterpoint. Dr T's mentally unstable wife walks through a shopping mall, takes off all her clothes and dances in a fountain. No surprise that she's under a shop sign which links her to a deity. She's not only a goddess, an innocent nymph who exists only to be naked, worshipped, twirl and look pretty, but another up-market commodity. As one psychologist says in the film, she's been loved and pampered too much, Dr T putting his wife on such a high a pedestal that she eventually regresses to a childlike state, unable to do anything for herself.What follows are a number of symbolic little scenes. The men in the film are dumb carnalists who hunt and shoot flying golf balls, whilst the women are all ditsy airheads, drunks, lesbians or vacuous shopaholics. The women of Dallas are also fighting for a Dallas freeway to be named after a woman, an act which Dr T himself supports; anything to keep the ladies happy.Existing outside all these characters is a woman played by Helen Hunt. She's a retired golf pro, far more calm and collected than all the idiotic characters swirling around her. As a professional golfer, she's literally in command of all the balls in the film. She and Gere forge a romance, but she abruptly calls it off when he offers to provide and take care of all her needs. Why would I want that? she says with a shrug. Helen Hunt - the only female huntsman in the film - knows that men hide their dependency needs and narcissistic vulnerability behind a fairly primitive phallic chauvinism. She's also aware that men symbolically control their women through phallic mastery, supremacy and dependence.The film then becomes a sort of feminist tract, Hunt's character raising the issue of female empowerment and opining that women should follow their hearts, reject society's expectations, be independent, be strong and be as sexually promiscuous as men. Another character in the film, played by Kate Hudson, exhibits this same character arc she turns her back on marriage and various authority figures (breaks the rules, answers phone in class etc) and embraces a lesbian love affair.But while the film advocates a form of women's liberation and suggests that women strongly dependent on men accomplish nothing (naming a freeway after a woman isn't a point for feminism, it's just a way to further placate loudmouths), such things are hardly new. It's been over half a century since the largest feminist movements, and if Altman genuinely wished to say something about womanhood, he'd have done so decades ago.No, what the film's really doing is presenting Dallas as the last bastion against the feminist revolution, and Gere, who thinks he's some smooth lover of women, as an unwitting ally of the anti-feminists. Worship at the alter of the uterus, in other words, and you reduce woman to the various stereotypes in the film. You remove their complexity, their desires. The alcoholism and vacuity of the women in the film is the direct result of men fawning over them.But the film goes further than this; so much so that you might even call it anti-feminist. Remove the chivalrous romantics like Gere, Altman says, and you're left with a world of Helen Hunts, family units destroyed, everyone sexually liberated, self-centric and cold. After realising this, Gere drives off into the rain, is sucked into a magical tornado (yes this really happens) and delivers a young Mexican woman's baby. In graphic detail, we see a child emerging from a bloody womb, a scene which immediately and violently clashes with everything we've seen before. Romance is gone, in other words, and replaced with cold biology.And yet Gere finds some nobility in his newfound role. Holding a blood smeared baby in his hands he allows himself a smile. He still worships at the altar, but that altar is no longer pretty. 8\/10 &#x96; Excellent. Incidentally, Doctor T's name, Sullivan Travis, alludes to Preston Sturges Sullivan's Travels, both films about a character learning their true value and contribution to society.
