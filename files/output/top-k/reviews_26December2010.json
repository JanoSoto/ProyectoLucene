Tyler Durdon (Pitt)is a much more fascinating character, for he is the very opposite of Norton's character. He is completely free of all the limitations most people allow themselves to be consumed by, despite in an ironic manner being in a physial form that shows just how perfect he comes off as.He doesn't consider anyone in existence to be special, including himself, saying that nobody is defined by anything, Your not your car, your house or your suit', these very words prove his release from those limitations.

It's very strange that when we fight a known enemy any actions, no matter how cruel or vile, they seem normal. However when we fight amongst ourselves, all goes to hell.

If many people believed that being a soldier back then was a proud honor, no matter what unit, or what position they were placed in, then they were dead wrong. It was nothing more and nothing less. The grunts were able to take it , on the account that they were nothing before they had the military. It's quite graphic and yet enjoyable to watch as Oliver Stone digs deep into what many soldiers were like back then. Vietnam was a very difficult time, not just for this country, but for the very men fighting in it. In their gaze of that very Hell they resorted to drug use out of a necessity to escape that endless cold reality of death, and what struck me as intrigued was just how believable the characters were. They all felt screwed over in whatever way the war ,or the military had done to them. Some used their own moral compass to make actions any sane human would easily hesitate to make. The very performance by Tom Beranger as Sgt. Barnes was incredible, as he represented a soldier who has had his good time in Vietnam well enough to see how and what he can do. He gazes on the very pot heads he commands, saying he is reality, only to have viewers assume that he feels no repent for his less than prominent actions. Sgt. Allias (Daffoe) is portrayed as the more rational soldier, whom like Barnes understands the nature of how much insanity defines the very war they are fighting, while still maintaining his own dignity as a human being and not a murderer with authority. Its very clear that the established rivalry among these two Sergeants divides soldiers into two different sides, making the Gooks the least of their problems. Basically the film portrays Vietnam as general Vietnam. Early 5 a.m. wake up, daily digging and humping, and all night watches through dark infested Jungles. It's all very clear at just how little the gooks were as the enemy, for the true battle was between themselves. As Taylor's character goes through more improved developments, responding more commonly to the very site of war, everything becomes more clear to him. That very knowledge has given him the assurance that he can use what he learned in his experience as guidance, knowing he will never be the same again. Taylor came to Vietnam as a college dropout with very little Ambition, and he came out with more than an experience, but a forever lasting mark of the true nature of war. Platoon is a riveting war drama, combining a brilliant form of direction as Oliver Stone maintains focus on the elements of the Vietnam war, out of respect for those who died, and delivers characters that are very common and yet very unique by the personalities that define them. Platoon gives viewers a deeper look into what goes on inside the platoon, rather than what is outside it.

It is basically a complete reflection of Allen's state of mind in 1980. The movie is about a film director named Sandy Bates, who is starting to have anxiety about what he is doing for a living and starts to question its purpose. He goes into a retrospective recluse about his previous work and begins to recall all the things that influence his love of film. I wasn't alive in 1980 and I didn't know Woody Allen in 1980, but if you can't call this autobiographical to the extreme, I don't know what you can.Stardust Memories is an odd film because it really has no storyline. It is told in an anecdotal narrative style as Bates recalls different moments in his life as new moments arise and influence him. He considers all the different oddities that inspired him to make the popular films he's made. There are a lot of different women in Bates' life and they all have various amounts of influence on him as a filmmaker, and the whole film is told through these stories about women he's encountered or loved in the past. After a while you start to think, what is the point of all this? The film doesn't seem to be going anywhere after a while, and it all boils down to just a lot of retrospect and internal conflict more than anything else. It feels as though Woody Allen made this film for himself rather than anybody else. And there isn't necessarily anything wrong with that, but to the viewer it's not very appealing.One of the biggest issues with this film is that Woody Allen's character, Sandy Bates, isn't likable. He's a complete narcissist and is completely full of himself. He doesn't necessarily convey it outwardly dramatically, but he has a constant aura of egotistical jerk that is impossible to really connect with. He feels detached from the world and it makes it difficult to relate to his conflict, but that really just goes back to the fact that this is a film for Woody, not a film for the audience. And that's a paradox that just doesn't work with me, and it only made me feel like this film was a waste of time.Artistically this film doesn't have a whole lot going for it either. It has your typical Woody Allen nuances, but not to the level that some of his other great films have. It doesn't stick to one specific style and its thoughts seem a little scattered. It is shot in black and white which was interesting, but eventually got to the point where it served no purpose. Visually there was nothing in this film that gave me that fascination or 'wow' reaction that Allen's films typically incite in me. There are undoubtedly some well designed moments of the film with shots that made me nod my head in appreciation, but it doesn't have that consistent visual style that other Woody Allen films have.Allen was 45 years old when he made this film. I think you could definitely call it his mid-life crisis movie. All of the thoughts that were whizzing around in Allen's mind at that point in his neurotic life are conveyed and put into a script through Stardust Memories. For Allen I'm sure this film was a huge success that probably helped him sort through his life and allow his mind to clamber out of that jumbled crisis it was going through. But for me as the viewer I didn't get much of anything out of this film. Allen's intentions were clear, but the movie felt like a waste of time.

LBJ was in the White House, the Republicans were priming Goldwater, both sides considered the Cold War with bleak gravity, and the world was learning to get used to the term nuclear deterrent, which meant that if you kill me, I'll kill you, and then we'll all die. Better dead than Red, several believed. Others believed the reverse. The options were not attractive. The Bomb eclipsed foreign policy.Then the great BAFTA-winning expatriate's masterpiece of satire, paranoia and straight comedy released with the power of a splash of ice water. What Kubrick's Cold War send-up illustrated was not men reliant on machines, but vice versa, particularly the mad Gen. Jack D. Ripper.Proceedings on Ripper's army base are interconnected with scenes aboard one of the B-52s, and with an urgent assembly in the Pentagon's War Room, still one of the most unforgettable sets ever built for a movie, with its immense world maps impending over a vast committee with an undaunted sphere of light above it.The screenplay, by Terry Southern with Kubrick and Peter George, twists this premise into a black farce, clarified by bursts of sharp satire. Some of the dialogue has penetrated our lexicon. The scene at the telephone booth between Guano and the British ambassador, who doesn't have the correct change to call the White House and save humankind, is one of the movie's most exceptionally brilliant gags.If Sterling Hayden creates a scowling, unreasonable Gen. Ripper, George C. Scott is inspired as his foil, Gen. Buck Turgidson, who chomps gum, gnarls his mouth, and discloses one statement of dire straits after another to the President. And Sellers, as president, has a succession of awkward hotline exchanges with the Soviet Premier that slashes nuclear annihilation to the degree of an excruciating social faux pas.The defining passage on a subject so crushingly unpleasant that all one can do is laugh, Dr. Strangelove has the highest form of verbal humor The self-destruct device self-destructed, we learn, and you can't fight in the War Room. And counter to the theoretical deliberations in the Pentagon, there's the uncomplicated nationalism of the B-52 pilot, Maj. King Kong, who assures his crew there's going to be upgrades and streamers everywhere. His departure from the story stays one of the most recognized moments in contemporary cinema.The one part of the film, still one of the finest political satires, that doesn't quite succeed is the War Room sequence that comes between Pickens' rowdy ride and the ultimate nuclear montage. Sellers, as Strangelove, quarrels riotously with his disobedient bionic hand, yet the dialogue doesn't seem to go anywhere, and the scene feels peculiarly unproductive. In an earlier shot in the War Room, we've seen an elongated table covered with cakes and pies, and it's understood Kubrick meant to end the scene with a pie fight. Dr. Strangelove would've been perfect if he kept in the climactic pie fight. That's true brilliance. Without it, the film truly does feel as if it's missing a final scene.Regardless, seen after over half a century, like a morbidly sick Looney Tunes short it feels extraordinarily crisp and unsullied, a lucid, impudent, treacherous lampoon. And its eagerness to pursue its scenario to its commonsense close has an integrity that today's spineless gift-wrapping mechanics would almost certainly sidestep. Its black and white photography aids, moreover, putting an unembellished visage on its lethal political absurdities. If movies of this derision, cleverness and rancor were still being made, the world just might be better at staying on its toes.

He proved this talent when he directed A Nightmare Before Christmas (It's a shame so many fans of that movie just assume Tim Burton directed it and ignore Selick's achievement.) and made great use of his team of talented animators to bring Burton's original idea to life. Selick once again proved himself a good director with the stunted but visually stunning (And still somewhat enjoyable) adaptation of James & The Giant Peach. Recently, Selick did yet another fantastic piece of cinema with Coraline; but in-between James & The Giant Peach and Coraline... there was Monkeybone.Something tells me Selick regrets this one. Monkeybone is a film in which Selick sells himself short. His talents are on display in several portions of the film, and yet some portions are clumsily directed. Yet even if the whole film had been as visually impressive as his other works and as tightly directed, the movie would still fail with the script it is given. I have not read the graphic novel Dark Town, so maybe I should cut the script-writers some slack and blame whoever wrote Dark Town for inspiring this lazy, immature, and often annoying script.The film follows animator Stu Miley, creator of a popular animated show called Monkeybone, about a mischievous and perverted monkey that lives inside a timid students backpack. Stu gets in a car accident, and is sent into a coma. He soon finds himself in an abstract and insane underworld where he meets Monkeybone, who promptly sets out to drive Stu (and the viewers) insane. Stu wants to return home, but is duped by a devil in pajamas named Hypno - who instead, sends Monkeybone into Stu's body.The problem with Monkeybone is that the humor if you will, is immature and insulting. We are shown a Monkeybone cartoon early on, and it is cringe worthy. It baffles me how some people in the movie claim that the show is a children's cartoon as it is wildly inappropriate; and more-over, I don't know how any adult could laugh at such juvenile material. The cartoon focuses on how the Student is sexually attracted to his old teachers huge, sagging flaps of arm fat. He gets an erection, and Monkeybone (Who more or less is an anthropomorphic erection. Goody.) pops out and starts harassing the teacher while the student is humiliated for his quite visible erection. Funny? No? Well, get used to that kind of humor and trust me, it gets worse unless you REALLY like fart jokes.It is a shame that so much talent has to be wasted here. Brendan Fraser is actually fairly likable as Stu Miley (However when Monkeybone takes over his body, he becomes annoying and only makes Monkeybone's character more annoying as well.) and Selick has once again brought on board tons of playful and creative visuals. Monkeybone is animated quite well using stop-motion, and arguably the best part of the whole picture is the underworld and its abstract, bizarre, and downright weird denizens. There are even a few jokes that work through these weird visuals, like the Grim-Reapers mode of transportation being a little tricycle or how the gate leading back to the real world is known as The Great Emancipator and fittingly, the exit appears as a giant Abraham Lincoln head. There is also a genuinely disturbing (Yet memorable) scene in which Stu is forced into one of the nightmares that he himself painted years ago, where Selick shows off yet another fantastic visual effect that only makes me wish the films script was redeemable.However, when the film takes place in our world - it is clumsily directed and is made twice as painful to sit through due to the lack of any creative visuals. Monkeybone was already annoying in the underworld, but when he takes Stu's body - actor Brendan Fraser goes from likable to cringe worthy. The on-going shtick is that Monkeybone is still an animal, and acts like one and is hyper-active, perverted, and crude. One of the most insultingly idiotic scenes is when Monkeybone gets turned on by watching animals mate on The Discover Channel, and then we are forced to a 5 minute scene of him doing a bizarre sexual display in nothing but his underpants hooting like a monkey and doing a mix of dancing and animalistic moves. Barf. Oh, and did I mention he wants to give everyone nightmares by giving out monkey bone toys that fart nightmare gas? Yeah.All in all this is bad - really, really bad. I would have given it a rating of 2 if it had not been for the fantastic visuals in the underworld, and one genuinely funny scene where Stu is in prison in the underworld and runs into the likes of Stephen King and Genghis Khan.

I have not read the graphic novel Dark Town, so maybe I should cut the script-writers some slack and blame whoever wrote Dark Town for inspiring this lazy, immature, and often annoying script.The film follows animator Stu Miley, creator of a popular animated show called Monkeybone, about a mischievous and perverted monkey that lives inside a timid students backpack.

John Wayne (obviously) creating an aging, burnt out rogue turned lawman. Often remarked as John Wayne playing (or parodying) himself, but this is hardly true - in fact, Rooster Cogburn is one of the four or so moments in Wayne's career when he completely loses himself in the character he plays. He plays no false note here, none that isn't purely and clearly Rooster Cogburn.2. The story here is tight (sprawling only because the manhunt in the wild demands it), neatly constructed, and, with the occasional Hollywood touches, very faithful to the novel by Charles Portis - if one must criticize the dialog, one should start by criticizing Portis' book, because the dialog is almost entirely his. Portis' theme, the coming of age of a one-track prudish farm-girl in a world of outrageous and violent men of the Old West remains largely intact, and remains fascinating.3. Supporting cast strong performances throughout, especially by Strother Martin as a harried horse-trader and Robert Duvall as the wily outlaw Ned Pepper.4. Memorable scenes If a film should be judged by how much one remembers of it - with pleasure, True Grit scores high. Every other scene sticks with one for some reason or other - the horse-haggling scene, the court-room scene, Mattie's visits to Rooster in the Chinaman's shop - one just goes on and on remembering these scenes, and many others.Weak points 1. Glen Campbell; hoping to play the same trick Hawks did by hiring Rick Nelson and Dean Martin for Rio Bravo Hathaway cast a young inexperienced singer to play the role of a tough Texas Ranger, and of course it doesn't work. Fortunately, although he sings the title track, the film itself is never paused to allow him an encore. Still, although I don't really find Campbell's performance all that annoying. He's a walking piece of wood, no doubt, but an amiable one, and he gets the job done.2. Similarly, the music on the soundtrack doesn't really fit the material; it tries hard - too hard - to be dramatic, but this film requires a quietly folksy touch, not crescendos. Not surprising, with the exception of the final shoot-out - which would survive most any musical background, the best moments of the film have little or no musical comment.3. Editing although competent, it is rather perfunctory, as if the editors aren't quite clear on what they're supposed to do with the material. There a a couple major editing flubs, such as in the final scene between Mattie and Chaney that are a bit irritating.The problematic - aspects of the film that leave one undecided or even a bit queasy 1. The cinematography although Lucien Ballard could not fail to do beautiful landscapes, his work here is overall a bit flat in composition and definition. One needs to compare his work here with what he accomplished the same year in Peckinpah's The Wild Bunch to see what I mean. Peckinpah was, at his best, a director who knew exactly what he wanted to see on the screen, and Ballard gives it to him. Hathaway comes from an older tradition that let the cameraman shoot the scene once the director had properly set it up. This leaves Ballard trying to shoot a 'traditional Western,' but True Grit is not a 'traditional Western,' despite Wayne's presence. 2. Kim Darby - although remarking Darby as having a limited range as an actress is being rather generous, the fact is in this film she is quite well cast - she is out of her element, but so is Mattie Ross. She is rather plain for an actress, and she certainly looks barely out of her teens , and acts it too. She finds it rather easy to project the necessary innocence (and indolence) of her prudish, determined character, but she does have one major weakness, a tendency to excitability that appears more anxious than determined.3. The direction A director's chore is to find some way to turn a story into a vision, and Hathaway just isn't up to that here. The story, the theme, most of the performances, the well-photographed landscape, all fill in when Hathawy's direction lapses, but the fact remains that driving the film is the script and Hathaway as director at best stays out of its way, rather than contributing to it.Overall, one of the best stories brought to the screen, admirably fleshed out by Wayne and supporting cast.

It introduced me to a lovable character that I'll cherish forever. The character is an adorable baby elephant with blue eyes and ears which are longer in proportion to its body, which eventually enable it to fly. Jumbo Junior is its name. However it has the nickname of Dumbo.Plot While circus animals are being transported, Mrs. Jumbo, one of the elephants, receives her baby from a stork. The baby elephant is quickly taunted by the other elephants because of his large ears, and they nickname him Dumbo.Once the circus is set up, Mrs. Jumbo loses her temper at a group of boys for making fun of her son, and she is locked up and deemed mad. Dumbo is shunned by the other elephants and with no mother to care for him, he is now alone, except for a self-appointed mentor and protector, Timothy Q. Mouse, who feels sympathy for Dumbo and becomes determined to make him happy again.The circus director makes Dumbo the top of an elephant pyramid stunt, but Dumbo's ears causes the stunt to go wrong, injuring the other elephants and bringing down the big top. Dumbo is made a clown as a result, and plays the main role in an act that involves him falling into a vat of pie filling. Despite his newfound popularity and fame, Dumbo hates this job and is now more miserable than ever.To cheer Dumbo up, Timothy takes him to visit his mother. On the way back Dumbo cries and then starts to hiccup so Timothy decides to take him for a drink of water from a bucket which, unknown to him, has accidentally had a bottle of champagne knocked into it. As a result, Dumbo and Timothy both become drunk and see hallucinations of pink elephants (the famous Pink Elephants on Parade sequence).The next morning, Dumbo and Timothy wake up in a tree. Timothy wonders how they got up in the tree, and concludes that Dumbo flew up there using his large ears as wings. With the help of a group of crows, Timothy is able to get Dumbo to fly again, using a psychological trick of a magic feather to boost his confidence.Back at the circus, Dumbo must perform his stunt of jumping from a high building, this time from a much higher platform. On the way down, Dumbo loses the feather and Timothy tells him that the feather was never magical, and that he is still able to fly. Dumbo is able to pull out of the dive and flies around the circus, finally striking back at his tormentors as the stunned audience looks on in amazement.After this performance, Dumbo becomes a media sensation, Timothy becomes his manager, and Dumbo and Mrs. Jumbo are given a private car on the circus train.A famous song in the film When I See An Elephant Fly...I saw a peanut stand, heard a rubber band, I saw a needle that winked its eye. But I think I will have seen everything When I see an elephant fly.I saw a front porch swing, heard a diamond ring, I saw a polka-dot railroad tie. But I think I will have seen everything when I see an elephant fly.I seen a clothes horse, he r'ar up and buck And they tell me that a man made a vegetable truck I didn't see that, I only heard But just to be sociable I'll take your wordI heard a fireside chat, I saw a baseball bat And I just laughed till I thought I'd die But I'd be done see'n about everything when I see an elephant flyAfter its October 23 release, Dumbo proved to be a financial miracle compared to other Disney films. The simple film only cost $813,000 to produce, half the cost of Snow White, less than a third of the cost of Pinocchio, and certainly less than the expensive Fantasia. Dumbo eventually grossed $1.6 million during its original release; it and Snow White were the only two pre-1943 Disney features to turn a profit. It was intended for Dumbo to be on the cover of the December 1941 issue of Time, but the idea was dropped when the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor, resulting in the United States entering World War II and reducing the box office draw of the film.Dumbo won the 1941 Academy Award for Original Music Score, awarded to musical directors Frank Churchill and Oliver Wallace. Churchill and lyricist Ned Washington were also nominated for the Academy Award for Best Song for Baby Mine 10\/10 points.

It introduced me to a lovable character that I'll cherish forever. The character is an adorable baby elephant with blue eyes and ears which are longer in proportion to its body, which eventually enable it to fly. Jumbo Junior is its name. However it has the nickname of Dumbo.Plot While circus animals are being transported, Mrs. Jumbo, one of the elephants, receives her baby from a stork. The baby elephant is quickly taunted by the other elephants because of his large ears, and they nickname him Dumbo.Once the circus is set up, Mrs. Jumbo loses her temper at a group of boys for making fun of her son, and she is locked up and deemed mad. Dumbo is shunned by the other elephants and with no mother to care for him, he is now alone, except for a self-appointed mentor and protector, Timothy Q. Mouse, who feels sympathy for Dumbo and becomes determined to make him happy again.The circus director makes Dumbo the top of an elephant pyramid stunt, but Dumbo's ears causes the stunt to go wrong, injuring the other elephants and bringing down the big top. Dumbo is made a clown as a result, and plays the main role in an act that involves him falling into a vat of pie filling. Despite his newfound popularity and fame, Dumbo hates this job and is now more miserable than ever.To cheer Dumbo up, Timothy takes him to visit his mother. On the way back Dumbo cries and then starts to hiccup so Timothy decides to take him for a drink of water from a bucket which, unknown to him, has accidentally had a bottle of champagne knocked into it. As a result, Dumbo and Timothy both become drunk and see hallucinations of pink elephants (the famous Pink Elephants on Parade sequence).The next morning, Dumbo and Timothy wake up in a tree. Timothy wonders how they got up in the tree, and concludes that Dumbo flew up there using his large ears as wings. With the help of a group of crows, Timothy is able to get Dumbo to fly again, using a psychological trick of a magic feather to boost his confidence.Back at the circus, Dumbo must perform his stunt of jumping from a high building, this time from a much higher platform. On the way down, Dumbo loses the feather and Timothy tells him that the feather was never magical, and that he is still able to fly. Dumbo is able to pull out of the dive and flies around the circus, finally striking back at his tormentors as the stunned audience looks on in amazement.After this performance, Dumbo becomes a media sensation, Timothy becomes his manager, and Dumbo and Mrs. Jumbo are given a private car on the circus train.A famous song in the film When I See An Elephant Fly...I saw a peanut stand, heard a rubber band, I saw a needle that winked its eye. But I think I will have seen everything When I see an elephant fly.I saw a front porch swing, heard a diamond ring, I saw a polka-dot railroad tie. But I think I will have seen everything when I see an elephant fly.I seen a clothes horse, he r'ar up and buck And they tell me that a man made a vegetable truck I didn't see that, I only heard But just to be sociable I'll take your wordI heard a fireside chat, I saw a baseball bat And I just laughed till I thought I'd die But I'd be done see'n about everything when I see an elephant flyAfter its October 23 release, Dumbo proved to be a financial miracle compared to other Disney films. The simple film only cost $813,000 to produce, half the cost of Snow White, less than a third of the cost of Pinocchio, and certainly less than the expensive Fantasia. Dumbo eventually grossed $1.6 million during its original release; it and Snow White were the only two pre-1943 Disney features to turn a profit. It was intended for Dumbo to be on the cover of the December 1941 issue of Time, but the idea was dropped when the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor, resulting in the United States entering World War II and reducing the box office draw of the film.Dumbo won the 1941 Academy Award for Original Music Score, awarded to musical directors Frank Churchill and Oliver Wallace. Churchill and lyricist Ned Washington were also nominated for the Academy Award for Best Song for Baby Mine 10\/10 points. In short this is a gem of a film and definitely recommend for young children. Buy it on DVD.Email me Vivekmaru45@yahoo.com for more info on movies and movie-lists.

He practically schooled critics in the skills and finesse of the chase, as well as the power of cruelly withholding crucial information (from his characters and from us) and engaging the emotions of the audience. So let's not make any negative assumptions that we cinephiles tend to make about remakes. To find that the son of a green grocer has cunningly merged his long-standing design and the prevailing screen developments of VistaVision and color in his 1955 picture is not at all to say that he has compromised the freshness of his original vision or revamped an old formula purely to the end of the almighty dollar. It is the opposite, a contemporary reflection on his earliest masterworks, those drum-tight thrillers of the original version's era.The plot is sinewy and graceful. The film starts virtually as a travel brochure, and pacifies you into an effective comfort as you become acquainted with the ordinary American family that comprises the picture's leads. By the time the tension hits, you're genuinely concerned with the plot. An American family are visiting the attractions in Marrakesh, Morocco (this is where the picturesque matter comes in), when unexpectedly a Frenchman is killed without compunction before their eyes. Expiring, the Frenchman murmurs an obscure implication to the man, who happens to be a doctor. This makes him the man who knows too much. That's the launch of the whodunit. The chase trails close on its heels, comprising two hours of MacGuffins and forceful scenes, one of the most unabashed adventures the Master ever made.The Master's sense of humor is channeled through the homegrown American fish-out-of-water thread that makes up the film's deceptively unassuming exposition, for instance their marital scrapes and their jaded sightseeing. The dialogue determines the family as pleasant, although wife Doris Day seems just a little mistrustful. During a negligible confrontation on a bus, the family meets a Frenchman who asks them to dinner, but suddenly calls off the rendezvous and then appears at the same restaurant as James Stewart and Day, a hilarious scene as the lanky, dyed-in-the-wool Stewart finds customary Moroccan dining to be trying.Day is startlingly moving as the mother who is hysterical about her child. The Old Ignatian's loathing of the police is clear throughout, as ineffective officers dismiss the family's dilemma. Much in the vein of the Knighted film pioneer's thrilling British thrillers, I love the way music plays such a vital role in the film and yet there's relatively little score, as was the case with The Lady Vanishes. Indeed, one of Hitch's most melodious films, music vital to this movie from the first frame. The clang of the cymbals will be employed to cover an assassin's gunshot. And Day's Que Sera, Sera is employed in both the frivolous moments of the movie and as a sniveling flare for her abducted son by which to pinpoint her.It's the sort of wit that could de-vein a shrimp that marked the Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire's earlier classics, particularly the most visceral ones which streamline the excitement, like Lady, The 39 Steps and Saboteur. Shedding the sagging gloss of his Selznick productions and going back to basics, he turned out this enormously and especially engaging action thriller with first-rate performances that he employs as suspense tools in and of themselves in a succession of skillfully framed and firmly directed scenes.

I always appreciate movies that find a good balance in every category action, plot, character development, themes, villains, etc. Of all the Star Trek films, I think VI really achieves that balance in spades. Captain Kirk and crew are three months away from retirement when a Klingon moon called Praxis explodes, and the shock wave somehow pollutes the Klingon home world's atmosphere. In 50 years time, the planet will be uninhabitable. With this crisis, many Klingons come to believe that peace with the Federation is the only possible way to save their species, because they don't have the resources to restore their planet's atmosphere. Spock volunteers the Enterprise Crew to host a meeting with the Klingon Premier, Gorkon (similar to Gorbachev, not a coincidence), much to the chagrin of Captain Kirk, who despises Klingons for the death of his son. Gorkon genuinely desires peace, and refers to the future as the Undiscovered Country, a reference to the Shakespeare play, Hamlet. Things go awry when the Enterprise seemingly fires a torpedo at Gorkon's ship, but according to the ship's inventory, no warheads had been fired. Kirk is put on trial for the death of Gorkon, putting the peace process in jeopardy. Nicholas Meyer, the director of the fan favorite, The Wrath of Khan, also directed Star Trek VI, and he gives us more top notch space battles, but more importantly, the same character driven qualities as Khan. Kirk and his crew stubbornly refuse to really accept that the Klingons could actually change, when in fact they are guilty of the same thing. People have criticized this aspect of the film, because the crew did not express such prejudices before this film. Honestly I think it would be harder to believe that they did not possess any prejudices, considering relations between the Federation and the Klingons had been rocky for decades, and they killed Kirk's son. I believe Gene Roddenberry was against this aspect of the story, and Shatner had problems with some of his lines, but I am glad Nicholas Meyer and Leonard Nimoy, the writer of the film, pretty much had free reign. I think the film would have only been half as interesting without focusing on the crew's prejudices. Rounding out the cast are Christopher Plummer as the delightfully evil Klingon General Chang, and Kim Catrall as the Vulcan Lt. Valeris, who was originally supposed to be Savik from Star Trek III, but Gene Roddenberry overruled Nicholas Meyer and would not allow him to use her for reasons that become apparent in the end. Shatner, Nimoy, and Kelley give good performances as usual. The Undiscovered Country also excels in the plot department. It is a story about healing old wounds, recognizing one's flaws, and taking steps toward a new future, similar to the end of the Cold War. I have a background in history, so the historical parallels probably appeal to me more than most people, but Spock also uncovers an intricate conspiracy to ruin the peace process that reveals the Federation has not evolved as much since the twentieth century as they thought. Kirk and McKoy also have to escape from a prison in a sub plot that has many parallels to the Bridge on the River Kwai and Escape from Alcatraz. I think this movie had a more interesting plot than Wrath of Khan, which was just a simple battle between old enemies.I really don't have many criticisms of this film, except the detective story on the Enterprise is a little thin. The Enterprise crew is missing one member, Sulu, as George Takei finally convinced Nimoy to make his character the Captain of the Excelsior. I think it's interesting he was promoted to Captain, but it's a little inappropriate that Sulu is not present for the Enterprise crew's last hurrah. The Undiscovered Country is definitely my favorite Trek film, and I think you can make a good case for it being the best, given its good balance in the plot, action, character, and thematic departments. This was the send off film for the original cast, and I'm glad it turned out to be a good one. The last film in a series turns out to be the worst all too often. You really feel something for this crew in the last scene, where Kirk defies his orders to return to his star base so they can enjoy one final voyage. This really should have been the only farewell to Captain Kirk, as his appearance in Generations was not really necessary. I encourage everyone to visit Star Trek VI and give it the praise it deserves, as it often gets lost behind Khan, Voyage Home, and First Contact.

Honestly I think it would be harder to believe that they did not possess any prejudices, considering relations between the Federation and the Klingons had been rocky for decades, and they killed Kirk's son. I believe Gene Roddenberry was against this aspect of the story, and Shatner had problems with some of his lines, but I am glad Nicholas Meyer and Leonard Nimoy, the writer of the film, pretty much had free reign. I think the film would have only been half as interesting without focusing on the crew's prejudices. Rounding out the cast are Christopher Plummer as the delightfully evil Klingon General Chang, and Kim Catrall as the Vulcan Lt. Valeris, who was originally supposed to be Savik from Star Trek III, but Gene Roddenberry overruled Nicholas Meyer and would not allow him to use her for reasons that become apparent in the end. Shatner, Nimoy, and Kelley give good performances as usual. The Undiscovered Country also excels in the plot department. It is a story about healing old wounds, recognizing one's flaws, and taking steps toward a new future, similar to the end of the Cold War. I have a background in history, so the historical parallels probably appeal to me more than most people, but Spock also uncovers an intricate conspiracy to ruin the peace process that reveals the Federation has not evolved as much since the twentieth century as they thought. Kirk and McKoy also have to escape from a prison in a sub plot that has many parallels to the Bridge on the River Kwai and Escape from Alcatraz. I think this movie had a more interesting plot than Wrath of Khan, which was just a simple battle between old enemies.I really don't have many criticisms of this film, except the detective story on the Enterprise is a little thin. The Enterprise crew is missing one member, Sulu, as George Takei finally convinced Nimoy to make his character the Captain of the Excelsior. I think it's interesting he was promoted to Captain, but it's a little inappropriate that Sulu is not present for the Enterprise crew's last hurrah. The Undiscovered Country is definitely my favorite Trek film, and I think you can make a good case for it being the best, given its good balance in the plot, action, character, and thematic departments. This was the send off film for the original cast, and I'm glad it turned out to be a good one. The last film in a series turns out to be the worst all too often. You really feel something for this crew in the last scene, where Kirk defies his orders to return to his star base so they can enjoy one final voyage. This really should have been the only farewell to Captain Kirk, as his appearance in Generations was not really necessary. I encourage everyone to visit Star Trek VI and give it the praise it deserves, as it often gets lost behind Khan, Voyage Home, and First Contact.

Never mind that the material is entirely unsuited to the screen millions of people bought it, and some of those may have even read it, so what more do you want? Well, to begin with, how about something other than the usual Cartesian marketplace logic (I sell, therefore I am) as a reason for making the film in the first place? Junger's book covers a lot of territory and juggles more than one life-or-death crisis, dwelling in particular on the fate of the fishing trawler Andrea Gail, lost at sea with all hands, and the devastating effect of its disappearance on the close-knit seaside town of Gloucester, Massachusetts. In print the multiple focus makes perfect sense it's a maritime epic of men and women struggling against the implacable fury of the elements. But the unrelated parallel story lines (the primary one unresolved no wreckage or bodies were ever recovered) don't lend themselves to easy adaptation, and screenwriter Bill Whitliff clearly wasn't up to the challenge.Of course no one expects such a willfully dumbed down dramatization to capture all the nuances of a good book. But Whitliff's strictly perfunctory script follows an all too dispiriting path of least resistance, attempting (fatally) to touch all the same narrative bases as its source, without even a token attempt to capture the raw documentary power of Junger's prose. Instead we get a shipload of cardboard cutouts straight from central casting, pointlessly battling against computer generated ninety-foot waves before making their inevitable, noble descent to Davy Jones' Locker.Keep in mind that every scene on board the doomed trawler is pure speculation, which may explain all the narrative whitewash. No doubt the producers felt obliged to appease the local Gloucester community (without whose blessing the film couldn't have been made) by showing their dearly departed in such a phony, flattering light. But for the surviving friends and family of the missing fishermen the lackluster results can hardly be called a comforting legacy, reducing a tragic true story to the same crass, commercial level of any other overblown FX extravaganza, complete with high profile Hollywood talent (George Clooney and Mark Wahlberg, as Captain Billy Tyne and shipmate Bobby Shatford) lovingly photographed in screen-filling, video format close-ups.A faux-heroic music score by James Horner overlays every scene with a thick coating of saccharine gloss, and the whole package was (mis)directed by Wolgang Peterson, at the time still riding the reputation of his breakthrough international hit 'Das Boot'. The 1981 film was Peterson's ticket out of the European art house ghetto, but in all the years since then he hasn't made anything half as interesting or memorable.

'The Perfect Storm' is an ideal case in point, being one of those (now common) movies in which the camera-work is totally subservient to the lab work.

Spread the word, fellow humans &#x96; 'Planet of the Apes (1968)' is actually quite an intelligent sci-fi! John Chamber's make-up effects are still pretty good, even though the actors underneath have difficulty showing their emotion. The work was certainly deserving of an Honorary Oscar, though it beats me why the similar, superior ape make-up in '2001 A Space Odyssey (1968)' was completely ignored by the Academy.'Planet of the Apes' opens with a monologue by Charlton Heston that immediately reminded me of Rod Serling's narration for every episode of The Twilight Zone. My suspicions were confirmed when Serling came up as co-screenwriter during the opening credits. In fact, the film revisits some of the ideas previously explored in The Twilight Zone, particularly the Season 1 episodes I Shot An Arrow into the Air (three astronauts crash-land on a distant planetary body) and People Are Alike All Over (a visit to Mars distorts the conventional biological hierarchy).Astronaut Taylor (Heston) and two colleagues land on a distant planet after travelling forward several thousand years in time. They cross a desolate wasteland, but eventually come across life a tribe of primitive mute humans, and a dominant civilisation of highly-evolved apes. For narrative convenience, these apes speak perfect English, with fragments of 1960s hippie-slang occasionally thrown in.Taylor is arrested by the apes, subjected to scientific testing, and his legitimacy as an intelligent being is put on trial. The ape society, falling into familiar twentieth-century traps, refuses to believe that apes may conceivably have evolved from Man, and clings stubbornly to their belief in sacred Scriptures. This portion of the film resembles a bizarre reversal of the 1925 Scopes Monkey Trial. I found the screenplay, by Serling and Michael Wilson, rather clever. It gets us barracking for Taylor as a representative of Mankind (the natural human reaction), and then unexpectedly switches its moral compass, suggesting that perhaps Mankind doesn't deserve to survive.

Spread the word, fellow humans &#x96; 'Planet of the Apes (1968)' is actually quite an intelligent sci-fi! John Chamber's make-up effects are still pretty good, even though the actors underneath have difficulty showing their emotion. The work was certainly deserving of an Honorary Oscar, though it beats me why the similar, superior ape make-up in '2001 A Space Odyssey (1968)' was completely ignored by the Academy.'Planet of the Apes' opens with a monologue by Charlton Heston that immediately reminded me of Rod Serling's narration for every episode of The Twilight Zone. My suspicions were confirmed when Serling came up as co-screenwriter during the opening credits. In fact, the film revisits some of the ideas previously explored in The Twilight Zone, particularly the Season 1 episodes I Shot An Arrow into the Air (three astronauts crash-land on a distant planetary body) and People Are Alike All Over (a visit to Mars distorts the conventional biological hierarchy).Astronaut Taylor (Heston) and two colleagues land on a distant planet after travelling forward several thousand years in time. They cross a desolate wasteland, but eventually come across life a tribe of primitive mute humans, and a dominant civilisation of highly-evolved apes. For narrative convenience, these apes speak perfect English, with fragments of 1960s hippie-slang occasionally thrown in.Taylor is arrested by the apes, subjected to scientific testing, and his legitimacy as an intelligent being is put on trial. The ape society, falling into familiar twentieth-century traps, refuses to believe that apes may conceivably have evolved from Man, and clings stubbornly to their belief in sacred Scriptures. This portion of the film resembles a bizarre reversal of the 1925 Scopes Monkey Trial. I found the screenplay, by Serling and Michael Wilson, rather clever.

The film is a bubblegum whitewash of early American history, with all the misguided crowd-pleasing appeal of an Armed Forces recruitment ad, casting Mel Gibson as a conscientious objector (in screen vernacular always the next worse thing to an outright sissy) who rediscovers the moral rewards of deep commitment during the Revolutionary War, mostly by slaughtering half the Redcoats in New England. Screenwriter Robert Rodat waves the flag more stridently here than in his previous 'Saving Private Ryan', helping Gibson to shed his pacifism by presenting him with an adversary (British colonel Jason Isaacs) so evil and sadistic that even his own troops despise him (and later impaling the villain directly onto the Stars and Stripes, in a particularly grisly bit of low-brow propaganda).The story invites obvious comparisons with Gibson's own Oscar winning 'Braveheart', but despite the quality of the production (and the transparent self-importance of its epic 160+ minute running time) the film is still little more than a prestigious vendetta drama, on the same emotional and intellectual level as any Charles Bronson 'Deathwish' scenario. Ace cinematographer Caleb Deschanel provides the fabulous scenery, and then newcomer Heath Ledger valiantly takes up the matinée idol torch passed to him by his on-screen father (and fellow Aussie heartthrob) Gibson.
