Perhaps its not exactly as it is shown in the matrix, but there is a chance because people are so blind to see the truth that they believe anything they are made to believe...Now the acting in the matrix is quite god for a sci-fi.

This film is puzzling to audiences all over the world, and no one can really grasp all of its detail without a second viewing. Memento explores a variety of themes such as self-deception, existentialism, truth and the capacities of our memory. In route of exploring these themes, Nolan is able to play with the very structure of the film and what the audience has come to understand. The main highlight that separates this film from many others is the use of time. This reverse order that is shown to the audience works to put the viewer in the shoes of the main character, Leonard. They live and see what he sees. Viewers only know the events that have just unfolded on the scene and do not know what led to it. This is an elaborate gimmick that significantly gets the audience worked up and makes them question more about what they saw and what does it mean. For instance, only seeing a main get shot in the head will make viewers wonder what lead to that ultimate crime. On the other hand, seeing a man with a gun pointed to his head, they can conclude that he will get shot in the head and so the viewer is already speculating what will happen. This same trail of thought can be observed elsewhere in society. When we meet new people, we see them in the current state of time. We do not know their past, but often wonder what led to the creation of this person that we come into contact with. Where did he\/she come from? What has he\/she done until this time? Even after getting to know a person, how are we to be certain that what they say is the truth? So the viewer, the reverse chronological order can be seen as normal. It's just the same process they go through in ordinary life, only highlighted in this film. Of the many themes, existentialist ideas can be found throughout the film. The striving idea behind existentialism is that existence precedes and rules essence and that humans have free will and are the ultimate judge. It also states that since we are the bear sole responsibility for our decisions and actions, we must also face the consequences. Leonard's decision to deceive himself can be understood similarly. He choose to give his life meaning, by sending himself on a wild goose chase leading towards this Teddy character. He is fully aware of what he's doing, and only in that moment, because he will have forgotten all about it later. We are never certain as to who Teddy was or even what he was doing with Leonard, but we see that Leonard is exercising his freedom and will face the situation of murder. After forgetting that he had deceived himself, he kills Teddy, and now he's faced the ramification of deceiving himself only ten minutes ago. Another scene that alludes to existentialist ideas is during the narration, Leonard makes the remark that, The world does not disappear once we close our eyes. This follows the notion that with our death or unconsciousness, life does not come to a stop. Human existence continues to be. It follows the idea that there is no higher being and that we exist purely for that reason and that we make of it what we do and decide, and so after you close your eyes, life continues on with whatever decisions or actions you've made. If Leonard closes his eyes, it would not change the fact that he killed Teddy and that fact will still be there after he opens his eyes. It can also be said that we live a very fragmented life. Our society today has evolved into short snippets of sounds and visuals seen on television and the radio. We can never have a complete certainty over any of what we encounter each day. The truth remains hidden by the media. When we watch television, it's only a representation of what really happened, such as images of a crash, we don't know when, how, or why it happened. But we take it without question, the details that are given to us on the screen by the anchorman. We can only have truth in what we experience directly. In the case of Memento, we can only be certain of the live events that take place in color. Its fragmented order reflects how our lives too are in pieces. Only once we placed everything in the order we want will we get a message. It's possible to get more than just one message with different placements of order. For Memento, it's not just any order, it's specifically reverse chronological order. And so we get one concrete idea or theme. Other films such as Pulp Fiction have fragmented order, but not chronological or reverse chronological order. And so they would have a more open-ended theme that will bend and flex with the viewer that perceives it. The film also questions the reliability of our memories. It has been a well known fact that the human memory can be inaccurate and very subjective. Eyewitness accounts usually aren't enough in the court systems and can obscure the truth. Our memories can drastically alter the truth as implied by Leonard, Memory can change the shape of a room. It can change the color of your car. In the case of this film, the viewer must decide whether or not Leonard's memories can be trusted, since he is the one with a long-term memory dysfunction. Nolan's fresh style has won over most of the viewers of Memento. Its unique approach to time is, without a doubt, innovative. The plot is kept relatively simple which helps focus on the main idea of timing.

However, if one can make it to the end of the film with even an inkling of understanding, consider yourself lucky. I first saw this film during its theatrical release, but when I viewed it this time, I still found myself trying desperately to piece together the story.This film is about the main character Leonard?s search for the man who raped and killed his wife. His search has been made especially difficult due to the fact that he has a form of brain damage that inhibits him from creating new memories. (He remembers everything up to the point of his wife?s murder). Leonard is convinced that he can overcome his handicap if he relies on habit and routine. Throughout his investigation, he has collected certain clues and ?Facts,? which he has tattooed on his body. Leonard must place his faith in the notes he has written to himself over the course of his investigation. He has come to adhere to these notes without question because they are the only things he can really know for sure.The film starts with the last scene and proceeds backward as we see how Leonard has arrived at his conclusions. This film questions what is and what is not real. Leonard is asked what kind of satisfaction he can possibly get from avenging his wife?s death. After all, he would not be able to remember it. Leonard?s response is that just because a person closes their eyes, it does not mean that the world disappears. He claims that he is not seeking vengeance for himself but for his wife.Despite the unorthodox beginning and minor confusion as to what was really happening, I enjoyed this movie very much. Perhaps, I will watch it again in order to grasp an even better understanding of it.

Do not get me wrong, it is definitely a good movie to watch, but it is not like many movies where you can watch it, sleep through the middle, and then wake up almost at the end and totally know what happened. These days many movies are like that, but not Memento. This is a very unique, from the way it was written, to the way it was taped, even to the way it was edited. It is a movie told backwards, in all sense of the meaning. You cannot understand the beginning without understanding the end, yet you cannot understand the end without the beginning. However, at the end of the movie, you do not go away with a feeling that something is missing, instead you get the majority of the movie, and you're are so excited to be able to say that, since most of the movie you were so confused, that you settle for the feeling that at least you got the basic idea behind the movie.I encourage everyone to see this movie with someone else, because it is definitely a movie that gets better after a good discussion. There is a lot in the movie, and since it is told backwards, it is easy to forget some things, or to forget to tie two things together. That is why the movie gets better and more interesting after discussing it with someone else, and even watching it a second or third time. The main character, Leonard has a memory disorder, and is unable to convert short term memory into long term memory. This plays out in many ways, but most importantly in the way it affects the people around him. At first one would assume that the people around him are manipulating and abusing him because of his memory problem, but in the end, which in this particular movie was the beginning, there was definitely someone alive and someone dead.Something else to think about when watching this movie is the difference between the black and white parts and the colored parts. At first it may feel that only the colored scenes are giving you the part of the story you want. However this is not true. If you watch the black and white scenes closely, you can figure out many of the secrets that make this movie to intoxicating prior to them being bluntly given away in or towards the end of the film. At first Leonard may seem like a simple guy, but you must realize he is more complex than I can explain without giving too much away. Understanding that even while he has no control over his memory, he still has a large amount of control over his life will make it a lot easier to understand. In the end, my explanation will do no justice to actually watching the movie, so I highly encourage it. But do it when there are no distractions, and perhaps when you have time to watch it a second time, even if it's not until the second day, but trust me this movie gets better the second time, and in many cases even the third time. It is well edited, and except for a few lighting problems, it is very pleasing to the eye. Over all, I think it is a top notch movie, and I do not understand why it took me so long to finally watch it!

However, at the end of the movie, you do not go away with a feeling that something is missing, instead you get the majority of the movie, and you're are so excited to be able to say that, since most of the movie you were so confused, that you settle for the feeling that at least you got the basic idea behind the movie.I encourage everyone to see this movie with someone else, because it is definitely a movie that gets better after a good discussion. There is a lot in the movie, and since it is told backwards, it is easy to forget some things, or to forget to tie two things together. That is why the movie gets better and more interesting after discussing it with someone else, and even watching it a second or third time. The main character, Leonard has a memory disorder, and is unable to convert short term memory into long term memory. This plays out in many ways, but most importantly in the way it affects the people around him. At first one would assume that the people around him are manipulating and abusing him because of his memory problem, but in the end, which in this particular movie was the beginning, there was definitely someone alive and someone dead.Something else to think about when watching this movie is the difference between the black and white parts and the colored parts. At first it may feel that only the colored scenes are giving you the part of the story you want. However this is not true. If you watch the black and white scenes closely, you can figure out many of the secrets that make this movie to intoxicating prior to them being bluntly given away in or towards the end of the film. At first Leonard may seem like a simple guy, but you must realize he is more complex than I can explain without giving too much away. Understanding that even while he has no control over his memory, he still has a large amount of control over his life will make it a lot easier to understand. In the end, my explanation will do no justice to actually watching the movie, so I highly encourage it. But do it when there are no distractions, and perhaps when you have time to watch it a second time, even if it's not until the second day, but trust me this movie gets better the second time, and in many cases even the third time. It is well edited, and except for a few lighting problems, it is very pleasing to the eye. Over all, I think it is a top notch movie, and I do not understand why it took me so long to finally watch it!

I'm not certain I agree with Teddy's version of the ending (or beginning as it were), but I'm not certain I can disagree with it either. The sequence of events and the way in which they are presented to the audience as well as the reason for this manner of presentation require the viewer to question everything. Not only do we begin to question the events of the movie but we begin to question the events in our own lives and the way in which we recall them. Is it our memories which make us what we are or is it our actions? Memento is presented as what I find to be the ultimate form of a mystery; however it's a flip version of our usual concept of a mystery. Most mysteries are said to be written by beginning at the end and finishing with the mysterious beginning. These mysteries are then presented to us beginning with the mystery and ending with the resolution. This film on the other hand, seems to have been written from the beginning (if we take Teddy's revelations at the end of the film to be true) where this sequence of tracking down John G. begins and Leonard's reasons for it. Leonard sets himself up to murder who is supposedly the wrong man knowing that he will forget his own setup. But, when we watch the movie this is the ending. We begin watching Memento from the resolution of the conflict when Leonard decides that Teddy is the John G. who raped and killed his wife and enacts his vengeance upon him. Whenever a film is presented in a backwards form it's not only difficult to follow but difficult to put together and edit properly in the first place. The director used scenes moving backwards but the beginnings and endings of each scene overlapped just enough with the following scene. This method I think is what held the film together so well. It allows the viewer to question what happened just before the current scene while allowing them to see how it connects with the previous scene.Teddy at one point brings up the possibility of Leonard's pictures and notes being false and that he has no way to verify them. Leonard replies by saying that Memories are an interpretation, not records. Are our memories any better than photos? Aren't they just as difficult to verify? The difference between a Polaroid and our own memory is that a Polaroid is more easily shared with another, though we may not share their interpretation of it. Memories also have a kind of emotional attachment to them. Certain memories we block out because we have negative associations regarding them whereas many other memories come to our mind quickly because they fit into our belief system more readily.I think that Leonard's photographs and notes represent our memories in possibly a more manageable form. He does indeed have an emotion attachment to many of them. So attached that he tattoos many of them onto his own skin. He takes photos of those things he deems important. These are the memories he wants to be able to recall. But what of all of the things he sees which he has opportunities to take snap shots of but doesn't? He also alters his memories by crossing out notes on certain photographs and burning others. When he decides that he wants to kill Teddy in the future he sets himself up by writing on Teddy's photograph don't believe his lies. He's purposely altering the photo to associate it with something negative and to lead him to believe Teddy was his wife's rapist. Others also have the ability to alter his memory to their advantage. Natalie seems like a sympathetic person who's trying to help Leonard but we later find out that she has played with his memory to make him believe she needed help. Teddy also manipulates Leonard's memory many times, most obviously by using him as a tool to kill undesirables who could pass as Leonard's John G. Others can alter our memories by displaying to us that which is false, or by manipulating memories we already have but may be vague.A number of times in the film Leonard speaks of action. Is it our memories that make us who we are or is it the actions we perform? Leonard doesn't seem to be a different person throughout the movie. He has the same memories throughout it. His mind always starts off at the same place. But, do his actions in his different points of awareness make him a different person in each? One might argue that since he's acting from the same belief system that he is the same person. I tend to agree with this. Over and over again he's given the chance of killing his wife's rapist. Over and over again he chooses to do so. While he's blocked out the memories of his actions, they all seem to be based on the same set of beliefs. It's like with the case of Sammy Jenkis (or Leonard as we later find out). Every time he gave his wife her insulin shot he did so out of love. He didn't remember that he had done this already and thus she allowed him to kill her, but he was simply acting upon those beliefs which he thought was right.Memento is a true puzzle. I say this because it's not just an incoherent mix of various scenes and various people. Everything is interconnected and it's up to the viewer to piece the puzzle together. This may imply something about our minds as well. We have this collection of scenes and people in our memories and its up to us to decide how we wish to put them into place.

Antoine is in a catch 22, where no matter what he may do will result in some kind of punishment. Minor offenses, which many will not consider very serious at all, are blown out of proportion.Without giving away any more of the story, it is obvious that here is a kid who has been dealt a pretty rotten hand.

The third and final movie, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, proves to be the best. It has stood the tests of time and come out on top in the movie world. It plays a crucial role, in that it is the final movie. It holds the shoulders of the other two movies and is very pivotal in putting the final ending on a great series of movies.We had to watch this movie, so we could do a movie critique at the end. After watching the movie, listening to a critique and reviewing a critique worksheet, I have received a different understanding of movies altogether. I realized how much more information and how many different aspects of a movie there really are. Indiana Jones, is know different, it is full with all of this interesting information, sitting there waiting to be plucked out.The whole movie is shot from a third person point of view. The director, Steven Spielberg, uses the camera as the narrator. He does this to show the audience what he wants them to see. In this way, the film becomes different than the original book. The setting of the story, takes place in a few different places. They start off in Utah in the nineteen hundreds, and then we slowly progressive to multiple different locations, until we arrive at are final destination, the Holy Grail. The whole purpose of the quest was to find the grail and put it into a museum where everyone could enjoy it. To figure out the time period of the movie, you could use different clues such as clothing style. You notice that the clothes the characters are wearing resemble that of someone from the 1920's. That is exactly what Spielberg wanted to do, show you the date, not tell it to you directly. Towards the end of the film, you could use clues to figure out there location. You can easily tell this, when you see lots of camels, and vast amounts of dessert surrounding them.The two main characters of the film, are Henry Jones (Sean Connery), is the father of Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) and they are both on the quest to find the grail. The whole journey starts, when Indiana finds out his dad was kidnapped because his diary contained the clues to find the grail. Throughout the movie, the plot becomes ever present. Indiana Jones, or Jr. as he is commonly referred to, has spent his whole life trying to live up to his fathers expectations. Henry, his father, seems to think that his son has never accomplished anything big enough, or important enough. Indiana is constantly striving for attention, and this leads to numerous arguments between the two. By the end of the movie, they have reached a climax with their fighting, and finally end it, when Henry is trying to save his son from falling in a crevice.Many technical elements were used to help enhance the viewing of the movie. Even though this movie was shot some fifteen to twenty years ago, the way they splice the scenes and add special effects is amazing. Towards the end of the movie, Spielberg uses a camera technique called juxtaposistion. This technique involves showing one character doing one thing, then switching over to show another character doing the same thing.

The third and final movie, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, proves to be the best. It has stood the tests of time and come out on top in the movie world. It plays a crucial role, in that it is the final movie. It holds the shoulders of the other two movies and is very pivotal in putting the final ending on a great series of movies.We had to watch this movie, so we could do a movie critique at the end. After watching the movie, listening to a critique and reviewing a critique worksheet, I have received a different understanding of movies altogether. I realized how much more information and how many different aspects of a movie there really are. Indiana Jones, is know different, it is full with all of this interesting information, sitting there waiting to be plucked out.The whole movie is shot from a third person point of view. The director, Steven Spielberg, uses the camera as the narrator. He does this to show the audience what he wants them to see. In this way, the film becomes different than the original book. The setting of the story, takes place in a few different places. They start off in Utah in the nineteen hundreds, and then we slowly progressive to multiple different locations, until we arrive at are final destination, the Holy Grail. The whole purpose of the quest was to find the grail and put it into a museum where everyone could enjoy it. To figure out the time period of the movie, you could use different clues such as clothing style. You notice that the clothes the characters are wearing resemble that of someone from the 1920's. That is exactly what Spielberg wanted to do, show you the date, not tell it to you directly. Towards the end of the film, you could use clues to figure out there location. You can easily tell this, when you see lots of camels, and vast amounts of dessert surrounding them.The two main characters of the film, are Henry Jones (Sean Connery), is the father of Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) and they are both on the quest to find the grail. The whole journey starts, when Indiana finds out his dad was kidnapped because his diary contained the clues to find the grail. Throughout the movie, the plot becomes ever present. Indiana Jones, or Jr. as he is commonly referred to, has spent his whole life trying to live up to his fathers expectations. Henry, his father, seems to think that his son has never accomplished anything big enough, or important enough. Indiana is constantly striving for attention, and this leads to numerous arguments between the two. By the end of the movie, they have reached a climax with their fighting, and finally end it, when Henry is trying to save his son from falling in a crevice.Many technical elements were used to help enhance the viewing of the movie. Even though this movie was shot some fifteen to twenty years ago, the way they splice the scenes and add special effects is amazing. Towards the end of the movie, Spielberg uses a camera technique called juxtaposistion. This technique involves showing one character doing one thing, then switching over to show another character doing the same thing.

I have seen all three of them on a recent date but never really thought about what makes them so good. When watching a movie in the theater or at home you don't realize certain techniques or qualities or characters that make it so appealing to people.In Indiana Jones the camera is used to show the point of view stressed in the movie. It is in third person and depicts the events of his life- from his growing up as a boy to being a man teaching classes to a school and still exploring as a man.When you think about characters from the movie, you have to start with the two most important roles Indiana and his father. Indiana starts out as a young man trying to do what is right. He seems to grow into a man with priorities like his teaching career. He accepts a job to look for the Holy Grail almost trying to live up to his fathers glory, then he finds out his father is already on the same mission but missing. Indiana and his father have a rough relationship with each other. His father was not around much because of work when he was little so they're still trying to accept one another for who they really are. Indiana's father is different from Indiana in that he thinks before he acts and is almost more kind than Indiana. Their relationship grows throughout the movie, and it seems very real like a normal family would grow up. Most families do not have perfect relationships just like Indiana and his father, but they work it out to accept one another.Unlike some movies, The Last Crusade moves from past to present. It explains Indiana Jones in his boy hood years and how he grew into the hero he is today. He spends his time searching for the cross which leads its way into the present adventures and the search for the Holy Grail. It works out well because both enjoy going on adventures and this time they are working together- almost ironic since his father wasn't around when he was a boy. Besides searching for the Grail, I think they are searching for acceptance and a better relationship together. One of the final scenes in the movie shows Donovan shoot his father so Indiana would keep the quest for the Grail to save him.Throughout the movie Indiana Jones tries to live up to his father and his approval. You notice this because when searching for the Grail, no matter what he does Indiana cannot do anything right. Everything is made right by the end of the movie and there was realistic appeal because it sounded like a normal family and not just scripted.There are also technical parts of the movie that made it seem real and more enjoyable. The director uses cameras with different angles and changes views to see Indiana throughout his chases. Another technique was dim lighting and framed camera work to show mood, and what was made to think of certain places. The library is made to be creepy so the lighting was low and dim. Certain camera shots showed views that made is seem like you were really in Indiana's shoes, like when they showed the side mirror in one of the chases.Until now I never realized what actually went into a movie and not just acting. There are so many aspects that you don't appreciate when just watching a movie for entertainment. After critiquing a film you actually understand how much work and energy it took to complete a film like Indiana Jones.

Sylveser Stallone is on a funeral with his classy sunglasses and his designer suit. This all wants to look full of promise. It is already way to obvious. The director is still in the conviction that he can move his audience with these simple and obvious tricks. This does not work, at least not with a critical public that has seen some more movies. Sylvester Stallone plays the part of Jack Carter, performed before by Micheal Caine who stars in this movie as well. Jack Carter is mad because his brother has been culled by either Jeremy Kinnear (Alan Cumming) or Cyrus Paice (Mickey Rourke). He wants of course, as it behooves a real hero, immediate retaliation. He is going to scare Jeremy and Cyrus. Our stalwart fellow gets in his beautiful Cadillac, puts his gun in his pocket and drives to the victims he is going to take care of. Actually that is what the story is about. We should not forget the girl, performed by Rachael Leigh Cook.Almost everything about this movie is bad. The story is as shallow as a baby tub, the dialogs are awful and the acting is brazenly bad. Sylvester Stallone plays his worst part ever. Stallone must be either Rambo or Rocky, but not Jack Carter. This man is not able to express emotions. Throughout the whole movie he plays the tough guy, right in the middle however he is this sensitive man who can cry as well. I can't even remember why he actually cried, but it was about something silly. Stallone is a strong man who can run after bears and shoot with bazookas, but he is absolutely not apt to play a normal human being with feelings.The dialogs are horrible.

It was one of only a handful of titles that really scared the crap out of me. Released in 1961, this is cheap, cheap, cheap (the budget was literally $13,000, no joke). But that's part of its charm. Director Herk Harvey (who also plays the ghoul in the film) took every opportunity to shoot anything and everything on the considerable horizon, that he knew wouldn't still be there in two years, like the amusement park on the Salt Lake. That body of water was known for moving from year to year and when this was shot had just about drowned out the old fun-land on it's banks. Harvey just took a camera and moved right in, those police barricades you see, to keep people out were real! No sets were built. The place looks dead and creepy because, it IS dead and creepy. This is the main, but hardly only, charm of this deserved cult favorite. That it also has a literate script, which obviously knows how dumb the setups are, and how scary things should get, is the rest of it. The actors, too, especially Frances Feist as a fidgety, clueless landlady and the wonderful Sidney Berger as a sleaze-bag neighbor, are surprisingly effective. Candace Hilligoss however (they needed a star and she came closest to what the budget constraints would allow), is your basic stick of wood; but the character requires stoicism, just not so much, that you could make an end table out her. Forget about that, though. There's so much magic and old-fashioned bizarre b&w Twilight Zone atmosphere that if you unclench your muscles and plan on enjoying this, you can't be disappointed. Carnival Of Souls makes the best of one bad situation after another. Harvey needed a memorable score, so he made the ingénue a church organist; that allowed him to drench the scenario in what is clearly the best Gothic organ score ever written for a film. Rather than build sets, he found them, and they are incredible. This was Herk Harvey's brilliance. Any other director would have turned this project into a bin full of mandolin picks. I interviewed the director by telephone in 1995. A friendly, unassuming man, he explained that this was his only theatrical film. He had been teaching film classes at a college in Lawrence, Kansas for years. He did many films, but they were all industrial flicks, made to promote a business, service or government function. Even at that, they had large budgets and often featured big Hollywood stars. He was a contemporary of such famous directors as Robert Altman (who also got his start making industrial shorts). So that's how you go about watching this. You drink in the ingenuity of a guy who put his all into a one shot project that failed at the box office. Sure, it's not great, but it has greatness in it, and yeah, it is absolutely unique. You wanna see how bad this movie might have been? Check out respectable horror director Wes Craven's much larger budget color remake from just a few years ago. It's a total turkey.

It was one of only a handful of titles that really scared the crap out of me. Released in 1961, this is cheap, cheap, cheap (the budget was literally $13,000, no joke). But that's part of its charm. Director Herk Harvey (who also plays the ghoul in the film) took every opportunity to shoot anything and everything on the considerable horizon, that he knew wouldn't still be there in two years, like the amusement park on the Salt Lake. That body of water was known for moving from year to year and when this was shot had just about drowned out the old fun-land on it's banks. Harvey just took a camera and moved right in, those police barricades you see, to keep people out were real! No sets were built. The place looks dead and creepy because, it IS dead and creepy. This is the main, but hardly only, charm of this deserved cult favorite. That it also has a literate script, which obviously knows how dumb the setups are, and how scary things should get, is the rest of it. The actors, too, especially Frances Feist as a fidgety, clueless landlady and the wonderful Sidney Berger as a sleaze-bag neighbor, are surprisingly effective. Candace Hilligoss however (they needed a star and she came closest to what the budget constraints would allow), is your basic stick of wood; but the character requires stoicism, just not so much, that you could make an end table out her. Forget about that, though. There's so much magic and old-fashioned bizarre b&w Twilight Zone atmosphere that if you unclench your muscles and plan on enjoying this, you can't be disappointed. Carnival Of Souls makes the best of one bad situation after another. Harvey needed a memorable score, so he made the ingénue a church organist; that allowed him to drench the scenario in what is clearly the best Gothic organ score ever written for a film. Rather than build sets, he found them, and they are incredible. This was Herk Harvey's brilliance. Any other director would have turned this project into a bin full of mandolin picks. I interviewed the director by telephone in 1995. A friendly, unassuming man, he explained that this was his only theatrical film. He had been teaching film classes at a college in Lawrence, Kansas for years. He did many films, but they were all industrial flicks, made to promote a business, service or government function. Even at that, they had large budgets and often featured big Hollywood stars. He was a contemporary of such famous directors as Robert Altman (who also got his start making industrial shorts). So that's how you go about watching this. You drink in the ingenuity of a guy who put his all into a one shot project that failed at the box office. Sure, it's not great, but it has greatness in it, and yeah, it is absolutely unique. You wanna see how bad this movie might have been?

We know that the Declaration was signed, but you would not believe how much drama can be packed into such an event. You also probably won't believe that our national bird was almost a turkey.

Onboard Captain James (an uncredited Douglas Lambert) prepares to depart in a small spacecraft when a mysterious spacesuit & helmet wearing person named Benson (Harvey Keitel, hideously dubbed throughout by Roy Dotrice) opens an airlock & blasts the Captain into some protective wires which make him explode. This impostor takes the place of the Captain & leaves on his own for one of the moons of Saturn. Once there Benson lands in an experimental food research station called Saturn 3. There are only two people who live on Saturn 3, reclusive lover's Adam (Kirk Douglas) & Alex (Farrah Fawcett). It seems that Adam & Alex are making slow progress with their work so Earth has sent the first of the Demigod series of robots lovingly named Hector to help assist them in their research & hopefully speed things up a bit. At first Hector is in pieces, but it doesn't take long for Benson to screw him together & for the fun to start. Hector has the ability to learn directly from Benson, Benson has a special device implanted into the back of his neck which leads to his brain & Hector is able to absorb Benson's thoughts & personality through this device, or something like that. Unfortunately since Benson is a liar, murderer & a mentally unstable drug user Hector starts to develop some worrying personality traits from him. Including an unhealthy obsession with Alex, eventually Hector goes completely berserk & decides that nothing or nobody will stop him from achieving his slightly distorted orders. To make matters even worse Saturn 3 has just entered a 22 day eclipse & cannot contact anyone until they come out of it...Saturn 3 is one of those films with a troubled production history, John Barry started the film as director but was either fired or left depending on who you believe & the films producer Stanley Donen took over & completed the filming. I quite liked Saturn 3, it isn't brilliant but it wasted an hour and twenty minutes painlessly enough. The script by Martin Amis is not without it's problems, for most of the film there are only three human characters in it. Saturn 3 could have done with a few more disposable cast members for Hector to kill. Benson's motives are almost totally ignored, why kill Captain James & go to Saturn 3 anyway? About two thirds of the way through Hector kills him before he says anything to suggest why is is there, some of Benson's other actions throughout the film were also a bit of a mystery to me. How could Benson pass himself off as Captain James so easily? I was also confused about Hector's motives, what were his eventual plans for Saturn 3, Adam, Alex & why? Some of the dialogue is a little silly as well. The taking of drugs is mentioned but not tackled in a serious way as is the pollution of Earth. The 'Trivia' section on the IMDb states that Saturn 3 only has music during the opening & closing credits, well I can tell you now that I watched it mere hours ago & although the music is used sparingly in Saturn 3 it is scored throughout by Elmer Bernstein. I would also like to mention the sound effects at this point as they really got on my nerves, every time something happened there was an annoying exaggerated electrical sound like when Hector walks or does something, when a door opens or shuts or just operating a computer. The part of Saturn 3 which stands out is the production design & sets which are very impressive, Saturn 3 obviously had a fair amount of money spent on it's overall look. The deranged robot, Hector, looks quite good even if it's head is rather stupid in appearance & it's obviously just a poor actor encased in a robotic suit. It's just a shame he didn't get to do more, preferably killing people. Some of the spacecraft in Saturn 3 look extremely silly, impractical & are obviously just plastic models. The special optical effects are OK, they're not great but they are just about acceptable without becoming too distracting. The acting isn't that great, Douglas looks a little bit old for the role, the best thing I can say about Fawcett is that she's pretty to look at & Keitel complete with pony-tail is dubbed throughout so his original performance is lost. There is a brief nude scene with Fawcett, forget about any gore or violence as all we get a severed hand, a dead dog & a novel use of a decapitated head. Saturn 3 is generally well made & has a reasonable polish to it, nothing stands out as being particularly brilliant but at the same time nothing stands out as being particularly bad. Overall I found Saturn 3 to be an OK way to spend 85 odd minutes, with a bit more thought in the script it could have been really good. As it is it's average at best, watch it if there's nothing else to do.

This process was learned prior to his wife's death and was still in his long term memory. Leonard kept permanent notes tattooed to his body in order to keep from losing them. When questioned about his method of keeping his information Leonard defends his system by saying, by writing down facts I remember, but memory can change a car to a van or the shape of a room. Leonard impresses upon the viewer that his process of orientation is the most efficient and only possible way he can put the pieces together to track down his villain. The director uses a telephone conversation which moves in a forward direction (against the retro tide of the color portion of the devolving film) to explain the events that are showing in a retrospective play by play sequence of events. This telephone conversation is filled with all recalled information which is the only information that is store in his head. Leonard speaks on the telephone in a very lucid and fluid way, which never gave the impression that he had a memory disability at all. This black and white narration explains the process Leonard uses, as learned from Sammy Jenkins. Jenkins taught Leonard to learn not by memory, but by instinct. It is Leonards past experiences in his long term memory and his instinct as an investigator is what takes him to his wife's killer.......Great movie, I need to see it again to test the truths of the movie, very much like the movie The Sixth Sense.

It starts out with Leonard shaking a Polaroid picture. The more he shakes the picture, the less developed the picture is. This one scene sets the mood for the movie. In the picture we see a bloodied corpse. Who is the corpse? Why is he dead? Why is Leonard holding a picture of the corpse? Why is the picture becoming undeveloped? All these questions come to mind right at the start. Already we are filled with questions. Also, this subtle un-developing of the Polaroid picture leads into the fact that the movie is being played from end to beginning through the different scenes. Each subsequent scene happens before the scene that the view just sees. The very first scene is even played in rewind to establish this fact. We see the picture go back into the camera, the blood flow back into the body, the empty cartridge go back into the gun. All these things establish this back to front feel of the film.In the first ten minutes we find out what makes the film Memento really unique. The anti-hero of this film has this condition where he can't make new memories. He says he's had an injury that has impaired his memory. With this condition, he can't remember anything beyond his accident. He goes on to narrate about his condition and how he's learned to adapt to it. However, while he's narrating we watch him wake up and go through a routine by merely following notes he's left for himself. The filming during this is particularly interesting. It's shot all in black and white giving the viewer a much more vivid feeling of being lost. We're put in this generic motel room with no idea where it's taking place. With everything in black and white it just flows together making nothing stand out. All this increases this feeling of helplessness. We don't know where Leonard is or what is going on.One of the peculiarities of this film is the ambiguity of the characters. In the first twenty minutes of the movie the viewer is introduced to the three main characters Leonard, Teddy, and Natalie. However, the viewer does not know who is good or bad. Teddy seems cherry and helpful;, however, Leonard finds out that he is really named John Gammell. Leonard knows that John G. killed his wife. Natalie gives Leonard information on John Gammell and so seems helpful herself. The question is which side are these two characters are on.One of the interesting techniques this film uses is how it shifts scenes. By showing us the scenes from end to beginning, the film makes the viewer feel as lost as Leonard. Each scene is started with Leonard not knowing where he is. With the film playing backwards, we also do not know where he is or what is going on. An example of this is the scene that starts in the bathroom. Leonard is holding a bottle of alcohol. He turns the bottle over and says, Hmm I don't feel drunk. This shows exactly how he feels. He stops concentrating on what is going on and completely forgets what he is doing. He then has to figure out what situation he's in. With the scenes just starting and not knowing what has lead up to them, the viewer also has no idea what Leonard is doing a given situation. After the scene is played out, the scene in the timeline previous to that one is played. This way, we find out what the reason behind Leonard's placement in such a situation is.This film also shows us how much we depend on our memory. Leonard has learned how to function to some extent by repetition and routine. However, he cannot heal. His wife is dead and, as he says, I can't remember to forget you. Leonard functions only on a minimal level. He cannot pick up new skills and he can't heal old wounds. Everyday he wakes up and his wife's death is fresh in his mind. Also, he can't know who is good and who is bad. Every time he meets someone, it's like meeting them for the first time. This film forces us to acknowledge how much we really do rely on our memory.The final thought Memento leaves us with is that we all lie to ourselves. In everyday life we lie to ourselves to make us happy. There are things we want to forget, and there are things we want to remember. Leonard forgot everything new because of his condition. However, he also forgot some things he should have remembered from before the incident because he wanted to. If he forgot certain things, he would always have a reason to live.

He could have had Darth flinch, or gesture involuntarily and push the other racers away from him (or something similar) without realising what he had done. That would have been great. 3. Taking a good actor like Natalie Portman and making her speak in a dull monotone throughout the film. That'll put the audience to sleep. 4. Using weak, comedy relief robots for the bad guys. Well we can't have little Darth shooting real people can we? 5. Introducing this ridiculous concept of the (whatever they are) in the blood which creates the force. When Alec Guiness explained the force in the original, he made it sound great. Liam Neeson (not his fault) made it sound like a blood disease.There is more, but these are bad enough.
