There a couple of reasons for this 1) the film is about two and a half hours long, so I had the time and 2) the film is very slow and boring, so I wasn't lost in the film and could focus on my notes without fear of missing anything. What's most surprising about the failure of SUNSHINE STATE is that director John Sayles is usually pretty reliable and (as we were oft-reminded by the Reel 13 hosts) is a legend in independent cinema. He has at least two masterpieces (Orson Welles used to say you only needed one) with EIGHT MEN OUT (1988) and the frequently forgotten Spanish-language MEN WITH GUNS (1998) (Some people might include LONE STAR (1996) on that list, but I am not among them). He might even have a few more with MATEWAN (1987) and CITY OF HOPE (1991), but I haven't seen them yet, so I'll have to abstain. The point is how did such a prolific auteur miss the mark so badly? Ambition, for one thing. While he has had success with gambles in the past (EIGHT MEN OUT was awfully ambitious too &#150; an independent period piece about baseball???), Sunshine State seems to bite off more than it could chew. Critics often say that any film with lots of characters is a wannabe Altman, which is often unfair, but this film actually fits that profile. Not only does it have a schmorgasbourg of protagonists, it also adopts Altman's penchant for zooms (particularly in reveals) and blocking criss-crossing conversations. For some inexplicable reason, however, these techniques are not as successful for Sayles. The zooms are awkward, stilted and poorly timed. The criss-crossing dialogue doesn't work as well because the characters should be in the middle of a conversation when the camera comes toward them &#150; not starting a new conversation &#150; that's contrived and forced. If anything, SUNSHINE STATE makes you appreciate the mastery of Altman that much more &#150; he had this amazing ability of making those techniques work seamlessly. Altman also uses his time efficiently managing to fill each scene with enough character detail that he is able to juggle all his characters. Unfortunately, for Sayles, only a handful of the characters are very interesting or developed (some story lines are just downright abandoned), resulting in what feels like a lot of wasted time.There are also several Fellini-esquire moments scattered throughout the film that substitute local Florida iconography (alligators, mermaids, pirates) for the religious imagery often utilized by the Italian master. Additionally, Sayles seems to have adopted Fellini's pre-occupation with processions\/parades, even choosing to end the film with one. These moments are okay and do fit in with the tongue-in-cheek tone of the film, but the basic character work, normally a forte of Sayles and the foundation of any film, wasn't done and so the extra touches have less impact.Possibly the most annoying part of the film is its social commentary, chiefly represented by Alan King and his group of senior citizen golfers who appear in random scenes interspersed throughout the film as a sort of Greek chorus, who offer observations on Florida and also the human condition. Highly unnecessary! If John Sayles weren't his own editor, these scenes would be the first to go. And then to add insult to injury, the overarching storyline (that thing that affects all the characters &#150; like the earthquake in SHORT CUTS or the murder in GOSFORD PARK) involves the big bad developers (an easy villain) trying to buy up land in town to create shopping malls and luxury apartments, etc. Needless to say, almost all the characters have a thing or two to say about this and they aren't subtle about it. It's almost groan-inducing.Among the actors (there are many), most of the cast is fine (I didn't love Ralph Waite &#150; he overplayed his hand&#133;), but Edie Falco is the one who stood out the most to me. In many ways, her character is the voice of reason in the picture, but she and Sayles (he always been good writing female characters) add layers of complexities - self-doubts, desires and contradictions. Timothy Hutton and Mary Alice are also very good in much smaller roles. They weren't as developed as some of the other characters, but I couldn't help but thinking that both of them needed to work more.Throughout his career, Sayles has had the remarkable ability to do a wide variety of styles and genres. His body of work is very eclectic THE BROTHER FROM ANOTHER PLANET is a far cry from LIMBO and PASSION FISH. With SUNSHINE STATE, he tries to expand the parameters of his oeuvre even further, experimenting with the sprawling, mutli-protagonist, episodic format. While I am very impressed by Sayles' versatility and interest in trying out different ideas, it must be said that his latest foray into new territory didn't work as well as some of his other efforts. But, for what it's worth, I can't blame him for trying.

This is not the only Hitchcock movie with this problem and even though I absolute love most of Hitchcock's movies and he was an absolutely brilliant and a one of a kind director, he doesn't get a critical free pass from me. Needless to say this movie disappointed me even though it had plenty of redeeming qualities, which in the long run still makes this a perfectly good movie.Problem to me is the movie its story and then especially the pace its being told in. Mostly the middle part of the movie is just a complete bore. Nothing interesting or mysterious enough is happening in it. From an Hitchcock movie you would at least expect some suspense but there is actually very little of that present here. You can say that this movie is not really being enough 'Hitchcock' like. Perhaps this was because this was Hitchcock's very first Hollywood movie and he was kept more on a short leach by the studio's and the movie its producers?A redeeming quality is the movie its last halve hour or so, when your whole view of the movie its main character suddenly changes when you learn about the truth. You really don't like sympathize for the man at first but once you know what really happened this suddenly all changes for you and he becomes actually a tragic character you start to care for.The movie is also being innovative by using some real dynamic and experimental camera-work at times, as you basically always can expect from an Hitchock movie. It also makes good use of miniature and while watching this movie I couldn't help wondering if this movie didn't somewhat inspired Citizen Kane. Some of the effects and camera handling seems to be the same and of course the Manderlay estate can also be seen as Xanadu, you don't need a lot of imagination for that.The movie tries to create a good dark and mysterious atmosphere but when there is not an awful lot happening in the movie, atmosphere is not really enough to make a movie with. It suits the movie that its being shot in black & white and all but the atmosphere is just not as good, moody and horror Gothic like as everyone tries to make you believe it is. The story just simply doesn't allow this.The movie has a typical solid '40's cast, with popular actors such as Laurence Olivier, Joan Fontaine and popular supporting actors such as George Sanders, Nigel Bruce and Gladys Cooper involved. It was especially nice to see Laurence Olivier in an Hitchcock movie, two Hollywood legends working together. The acting is overall good in this movie though it tends to become a bit overly melodramatic at times.Give credit where credit is due. This is a good movie but no way a classic, or among Hitchcock's best work.

So i'll comment more like an approach, for sure naive, but to fix some ideas i got from this first watching of Kagemusha.24.10.2008 -Kurosawa works like a painter. It is well known that he painted most of what he shot, and that helped him create in the mind what he would bring to the eye. The paintings are in themselves worth seeing; an extra in the DVD had an editing with dialogs in the film over posing the storyboard, in the order they show in the film. It's a good experience just by itself. So we have shots perfectly and exquisitely taken care. The composition is great, balanced as only a good artist would make;-in a way, this is the first Kurosawa film in colour, because it is the first one in which he truly works with it and makes it part of the composition. The previous experiences in color could work as well in b&w. Not here. I noticed how the colours carry the actions, how the perfectly balanced frames get alive because of the colours. The skies are amazing, of course, and the dream in the clouds as well. The artificial environment of it makes the film look sketchy, as it was in fact, for it is known that Kurosawa was preparing the big project (Ran)-The editing was great; The framing he gives is mostly still, his eye works like that of a painter, but the editing sequences all shots perfectly and it makes us believe that after one certain shot, the only possible shot that makes the thing work is the next one. It's a sublime structure, solid as a rock, and if you work mentally you'll see you wouldn't take anything or put anything. Kurosawa might. I guess that the editing was a mental process for him, he would beautifully paint the storyboard, but in his mind he would also build the editing scheme. That's why he could edit by night what he'd shot during the day-the story is, as many, about actors acting. The role of a leader has in itself lots to do with acting. That need to seat in battle, not moving, not showing fear, is showing something to the surrogates, and to the enemies, which may not correspond to the truth. Here we have a double pretending to be that leader.-Coppola and Lucas deserve being thanked for allowing this to happen.

The film quickly develops more subplots then its two and a half hour running time can comfortable handle.The silliest of these involves the romance between Sutherland\u2019s romantic IRA gadfly and a local village girl played by a disappointing clothed Jenny Agutter.

While the British are painted as morally equivalent (mention is made of the British concentration camps during the Second Boer war) and the United States forces are portrayed as untested buffoons (Two words; Larry Hagman; see below).The Eagle has Landed is about a Nazi plot to kidnap Winston Churchill and bring him back to Germany. An eye patched Robert Duvall plays the plan\u2019s author and Donald Pleasence plays his ruthless boss Heinrich Himmler (great casting there). They recruit German airborne leader Michael Caine (Who was educated in England though how a German at Oxford picks up a Cockney accent is never explained.) Caine\u2019s character is where the movie starts to float of the rails. Caine and his men are in a German prison camp because they tried to rescue a Jewish girl. This of course sets Caine up as the \u201Cgood\u201D Nazi. This honestly is as bad a copout as when Mel Gibson\u2019s character in The Patriot was proffered as being the only plantation owner in the American south to use free blacks exclusively.If the movie wants us to root for the Nazi\u2019s at least be honest about it. This unfortunate choice also gives a Dirty Dozen vibe to the film that it neither deserves nor can live up to.After Caine\u2019s men land in Middle Earth (sorry a small English village) disguised as polish paratroopers (Insert obvious joke here) they quickly set up camp with the help of a local woman with a chip on her shoulder (Jean Marsh) and an IRA man played broadly by Donald Sutherland. The film quickly develops more subplots then its two and a half hour running time can comfortable handle.The silliest of these involves the romance between Sutherland\u2019s romantic IRA gadfly and a local village girl played by a disappointing clothed Jenny Agutter. They have one slight meet cute date at the beach and based on a chaste peck and some poetry (not to mention the promises of an Irishman); Agutter\u2019s character shoots her other suitor with a shotgun, covers for the Nazis (including working their radio) and needless to say runs away with her charming murdering rogue.Pile on the Germans demanding the right to wear their Nazi uniforms under their disguises (Yeah that\u2019s a foolproof idea. No possible downside there); Sutherland\u2019s spy character not noting the large American ranger base just up the road; and the fact that the village itself is not suspicious of an Irishman who seemed to just drop out of the sky. (Literally) After this entire dimwitted English shire consists of about 12 people, a waterwheel and a Catholic church. (Not Anglican???) Why Churchill would ever visit such a hamlet in the first place is never explained.And then there are the American Rangers. I\u2019ve heard Larry Hagman was a good actor on occasion (I\u2019m not about to sit through Fail Safe anytime soon to find out) but in this film he is unfunny broad comic relief. While up to this point all the actors have done a great job with sometimes poorly written roles (I\u2019m giving Agutter a pass on this one) and have really helped to keep the movie together; Hagman\u2019s comic relief guy simply kills any serious mood the movie had created up to this point. It\u2019s overacting scene-chewing buffoonery that has to be seen to be believed.The other major American role is played by Treat Williams. Yeah enough said.Last nail in an otherwise attractive coffin are the action scenes themselves. Maybe I play to much Call of Duty but have any of these guys ever heard of covering fire or squad tactics? Another reviewer compared it to the A-team and I concur. The action scenes seem simply sloppy and the movie piddles out into a trick ending.Had they played it straight throughout and allowed the characters to act like real people this could have been a great movie. They certainly had the budget and the cast to do a great film. They simply didn\u2019t have the confidence in the material to let the chips fall where they may.

It was a coincidence to find Orgazmo on R4 DVD during these days, of course I wanted to watch this film since I knew about its existence and frankly was a complete and pleasant surprise to find at my local store, was a total surprise because I wasn't even searching it. So I was excited and now I can say that I'm not disappointed at all, for sure the South Park film is better and there's no doubt about it but Orgazmo is hilarious and I just loved it. Trey Parker wrote, directed and plays the lead role Joe Toung. Joe like Parker came to Hollywood but unlike Parker he came from Utah. It is the encounter of two different worlds, there you have elder Young, a sane Mormon man who just want to make his missionary work but thanks to people like you (I hope so) and I he will just get insults. And there you have Maxxx Orbison (Michael Dean Jacobs), a director in the porn industry having some problems while filming his new picture Orgazmo so the last thing he would like to have in that exact moment suddenly appears. Did I mention that elder Young is such an amazing fighter? Well that's the connection, elder Young has what the actor playing the character Orgazmo doesn't so suddenly elder Young has the chance to gain thousands of dollars for just few days of work. It is hilarious watching elder Young in the porn set being witness of a DVDA shoot, basically being afraid by anything. He hopes that Jesus understand his situation because after all he is using a stunt cock and he is making a porn picture just for the money and for sure his fiancée Lisa (Robyn Lynne Raab) is very happy for the thousands of dollars. His fiancée is just like him so of course she doesn't know about the film Orgazmo even when it became a big hit, now children plays with their Orgazmo toys! But Lisa is from Utah. I watched Boogie Nights like 6 months ago if not more and I remember one of the many great scenes. I think is when the character of Mark Walhberg is filming for the first time, in that scene both but specially Julianne Moore made such a terrific performance since they basically acted as bad as the acting is in a porn film, truly great. In Orgazmo this is not an important issue, in Orgazmo the great stuff comes from the elements of the porn film they are making and of course from the things that happens during the filming. There's also a subplot that is about what elder Young and Ben Chapleski (Dian Bachar), who is playing the partner of Orgazmo Choda Boy, do together after the filming. This subplot eventually will show to us a real life Orgazmo and Choda Boy and is funny but not as funny as the stuff that happens in the filming. The crew of Maxxx Orbison is great, they see their director like a f****** genius and they, well actually just Dave the photographer (Matt Stone) are always very excited. Stone is hilarious and his character makes one of my favourites jokes of the film (the naked mariachis sound like Depeche Mode!). Ron Jeremy plays the nemesis of Orgazmo in the first picture (he has a really memorable scene near the end during the final fight!) but for the sequel there's a new enemy, one we don't know how Orgazmo can defeat. Fortunately when the real problems begin Orgazmo and Choda Boy had already being outside the screen, now L.A. has its Superheroes but also its new villain! Yes Hollywood needs Trey and Matt.Simply put &#150; IT'S JUST VERY FUNNY, yes I liked this film and I think I can watch it again some more times.

I would imagine that viewers would have experienced the same feelings that I experienced after watching ground-breaking visual spectacles such as THE MATRIX and mind-warping thrillers such as MEMENTO.This film was lauded at that time (1950) for its stunning visual appeal and epic footage. Watching it in today's high-tech world it is a bit difficult to imagine this as cutting-edge, but one thing remains outstandingly clear this is yet another one of Akira Kurosawa's brilliant stories.The story itself is relatively simple by today's standards, yet there is a pervasive air of complexity that surrounds the film long after its 88 minute run-time. The simple story is told and re-told from four different perspectives, as can be read in any generic plot summary. The problem (and fascination) here is that no two stories are the same, and they all conflict with each other. What's even more perplexing is that the fourth story is told form a neutral point of view and it should therefore be easier for the viewer to believe this recreation, but having seen the initial three scenarios (each of which are equally credible), it is hard to buy into even this final telling.But forget the story, because this film is so much more than just that. This is a film that focuses on truths, untruths, and perspective, all told in a beautifully poetic way. To the viewer, the camera should not lie. The camera is the viewer's perspective into the on-screen world. As such, the camera serves as the viewer's viewpoint and should therefore be totally and objectively honest. It is by such means that people watch movies. However, in this relatively short motion picture, the camera 'lies' to the viewer on at least three occasions, and in the end the viewer is left questioning subjective truth versus objective truth. Many of the core principles are the same as in MEMENTO...that there is no such thing as an objective truth or objective memory. All events are dependent on the observer, and are hence subjective. Indeed, this is a film that has, and will continue to, spark many intellectual conversations\/arguments.As with the meticulous Kurosawa, the storytelling and screenplay is marvellous. It is hard to judge the musical aspect of the film simply because it is difficult to compare it to today's standards. All I can say here is that the music appears to 'fit' the movie well. The acting is top notch, and special mention should be paid to Kurosawa's mainstay Toshiro Mifune, as well as Minuro Chiaki, who plays the role of the melancholy priest exceptionally well. My vote for the best actor, however, has to go to Machiko Kyo, who competently takes on a different personality in each version of the story.While some people find it hard to watch classic movies such as this, I recommend that you see this at least once. It may just be one of the more rewarding 88-minute cinematic experiences you will ever have.3.5 stars, 8\/10. Should enter my Top 150 at about 115. Highly recommended.

Offering to go alone, he goes back to his ex-wife Brenda, (Barbara Leigh-Hunt) and tries to get on track again. Soon thereafter, he is fingered as the main suspect in a series of brutal crimes across London, despite being unaware of the accusation. When he is aware, he is convinced he is framed and is determined to prove to his friends Hetty Porter, (Billie Whitelaw) and John, (Clive Swift) and the police that he is innocent.

The best one is the incredible job it does in hiding the identity of the killer. This one is simply fantastic with keeping it under wraps, using plenty of different clues to switch it between the two main choices brought up quite frequently. That allows for plenty of suspense over the killings as it does a great job of keeping it ambiguous for most. It even gets a few solid suspense scenes in here, including the stand-out spectacular scene where the killer begins searching through a pile of garbage trying to remove a potentially damaging piece of evidence from a victim's grasp, while the truck is moving. The first murder is outstanding, starting off as a regular conversation with a deranged twist to it that soon turns into a full-bore rape that is quite shocking and then gives way into a brutal murder is an absolute stand-out of a scene, coming in so unexpectedly and being as brutal and shocking as it is allows for a spectacular scene that comes as a genuine shock. The types of kills in here are rather bloodless for the time but are more than made-up for with their brutality and explicitness, as the victims are all strangled with a tie, and the film goes into extreme detail in making sure that they're all completely in focus and that every ounce of their brutality is captured.

The beginning of the film is a literal chore to get through, due mainly to the film's decision to go several different ways than before.

This one here manages to take a simple story that could've been told in about ten-to-fifteen minutes less than this one is, as it shouldn't be about two-hours in length. The low-key nature of it all, especially once the murders have been discovered, makes the later parts of the film feel very languid and slow-going, another reason for this one to feel disappointing. It never for once shows any sense of urgency over the proceedings, keeping a distant air from almost everything that begins to rub off after awhile. There's nothing that happens which are really impressive, and in the end, forcing it to rely on other matters rather than the action, which is pretty slow.

Can he convince the jury ?This is a high-quality period courtroom drama with a lot going for it. It's a handsome production, an interesting story, has a first-rate cast and the Alcatraz setting is always a winner.

Better yet as the cruel assistant warden is Oldman at the height of his teeth-gnashing psycho period (see Romeo Is Bleeding, Léon, many others) and Ermey in the plum role of the dogmatic judge. Rocco corrals his actors with skill and times all of the big weepie emotional moments well, aided by a richly melancholic score from Christopher Young. I do have a couple of problems with the movie though. The first is the use of the tired old inspired by a true story tag-line. Yes, there was a real Henri Young, but he wasn't the selfless tortured martyr he's portrayed as here. I'd rather see a fictional story with no pretences or an objective documentary than some diluted halfway house. The second is the rather naive depiction of the criminal classes as saintly victims of institutionalised savagery. A good prison film needs to show the good and bad in both sides, as in Don Siegel's superior Escape From Alcatraz.
