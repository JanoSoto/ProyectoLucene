And I must say it was quite the big bang. It brought into the cash register about 350 Million Dollars (Tomorrow Never Dies did slightly worse and The World is not Enough did (very) slightly better). Still, having seen all three 007 movies I must say that it is the best Bond of the 1990's. That might be strange, regarding the fact that it was the first offering since 1989 when Timothy Dalton lead the famous character into a deep, black hole. I'd never dare to say that Dalton was the worst Bond ever (thank god for him there's George Lazenby!) but I must say he kind of brought the series to a low point for me. Pierce Brosnan though, miraculously came shooting out of that black hole, flying sky &#150; high towards the stars. He immediately formed the best original Bond (Connery) substitute ever (in my opinion), by making this film.This one has everything that defines a classic, though none of the names to do so. Then (back in 1995) every actor that starred in this film was pretty much a blank to the average audience member. Something that didn't remain like that for long and rightly so. Famke Janssen (Xenia Onatopp) came to star in X &#150; Men (and the sequel next year I guess), Minnie Driver (Irina) made Sleepers, Good Will Hunting and gave her voice to Jane in Tarzan, Sean Bean (006) will make himself immortal this and the next few years in J.R.R. Tolkiens The Fellowship of the Ring, Judi Dench (M) made Shakespeare in Love (apart from the other Bond films that is), Izabella Scorupco (Natalya Simonova) made The Vertical Limit, Martin Campbell (the Director) made The Mask of Zorro and The Vertical Limit and Brosnan, well he (of course) became the most successful Bond EVER!Back to this film though. I must say this one has everything a Bond film should have. A great story, exotic locations, action, beautiful women, fast cars and a lot of gags. It are of course these typical Bond things that make this film what it is. But it is the great direction, acting and script that make this a dream come true for filmfreaks. Every character is cast brilliantly, beginning (of course) with Pierce Brosnan and ending with Minnie Driver, who is in only one scene but still makes me laugh. And so does almost every character in this film. Bond's famous innuendo's are (again) brilliant and funny, but so are some the comments Miss Simonova makes. Whereas Miss Onatopps can even make me laugh just by means of facial expression. I mean the character Famke Janssen portrays is just plain and simple cool. She is just this sexy sadist who can crush people with her thighs. Which brings me to another good thing about this installment. There are by no means even hints or suggestions to why Miss Onatopp is enabled to kill people by breaking their backs with her thighs. They don't even try to explain, she just can do that. That I think is great, because if you are honest you must say ever attempt to explain this phenomenon would have been laughable.The direction is splendid as well and focuses on the most important things a bond movie has to offer shiny new vehicles, action, exotic locations and babes. These things are all captured very well by Martin Campbell and I must say that my favorite scene in the whole move (direction &#150; wise) is the &#145;beach scene' with Miss Scorupco and Mister Brosnan.  Not only does Martin Campbell capture the beauty of the surroundings and Izabella Scorupco here, but he also captures the dilemma of being James Bond.

The last soliloquy of Scott Carey that ends the film was for me every bit as memorable as the little protagonist fighting a spider, hunting for food, grappling a box with needle and thread, and living in a doll's house only to be scared by a giant cat.  Those scenes are all well-shot and create stirring images as well. Maybe what the film was trying to say was that it was not the size of the man but the size of his heart, his determination to survive, his faith in God.  At any rate, The Incredible Shrinking Man is certainly one of the films that must be considered when talking about the Golden Age of Science Fiction in the 1950's.  I rank it with films like The Thing from Another Planet, The Quatermass Experiment, The Day the Earth Stood Still, and Invasion of the Body Snatchers.

Grant Williams plays Scott Carey very nicely as he goes from 6 feet and some odd inch or two to no bigger than a thread spool.  Based on the wonderful Richard Matheson novel, the film mixes philosophy with action to get a thinking science fiction film that just does not show the life of a miniature as filled with peril but also adds some reasoning and rationale to the proceedings and even touches on man's relationship with God no matter what the size.  The last soliloquy of Scott Carey that ends the film was for me every bit as memorable as the little protagonist fighting a spider, hunting for food, grappling a box with needle and thread, and living in a doll's house only to be scared by a giant cat.

I didn't go into this movie the first time with any particular interest in Anne Rice or anything but a curiosity. But this film has a heart, a soul, a horrible beauty, an ambiguous sexuality and many other elements that greatly intrigue me.

Plot details revealed ahead!I thought that this film was absolutely wonderful on many levels. Aside from the obvious WOW factor from the brilliantly choreographed martial arts sequences, the plot is also rich and engaging.This is ultimately a movie about the human struggle against destiny. The lead character Jen is a noble daughter whom the standards of the day would have condemned to a banal life as a subservient wife to a pudgy aristocrat in a politically arranged marriage. She tastes freedom when she is secretly trained in the martial arts by the dangerous fugitive Jade Fox and is captured by (or perhaps escapes into the arms of) the desert bandit Lo. When the ancient Green Destiny sword is shown to her, she takes her chance to at last break her shackles by stealing the sword and fighting friend or foe who would take her freedom from her again. She turns away the man that she loves, the mentor who trained her, the hero who would redeem her, and takes on the whole world in her struggle to be free. However, in the end, only after her actions bring about tragedy does she realize that even more important than her freedom is her responsibility to those who really care for her. Brilliant!The other main characters also struggle in their own ways. The hero Li Mu Bai and the heroine Yu Shu Lien love each other deeply, but cannot express their love for each other because of an old taboo. Their agonized awkwardness in each other's presence, which eventually dissolves into tenderness when Li is close to death, is acting at its best. This is not Hollywood romance, but something far deeper. Li is also haunted by the blood he has shed in the name of duty and wants to give up his sword and be at peace, while Yu also wants to place warfare behind her and lead a simpler life (Li's giving up the Green Destiny sword sets the movie's events in motion), but this is eventually denied both of them.The film is also full of clever moments and beautiful visuals. The cinematography is elegant, unobtrusive and simply wonderful. On a technical level, the film is nearly perfect. There is very little I can find fault with.However, the movie suffers from several weaknesses, none the fault of Ang Lee of any of the actors. Since it is a movie in the Wu Shu genre, it requires a decent grounding in Chinese culture to interpret correctly, particularly the concept of Jiang Hu and Confucian social organization. Most Western viewers don't realize that in this genre, people walking on walls or flying through the air is completely mundane (in fact, most Wu Shu movies are far, far more outrageous aerial kung-fu sex, anyone?), while a noblewoman having the audacity to fall in love with a barbarian and to practice anything more strenuous than calligraphy, let alone martial arts, is what is unbelievable. This is a movie which looks completely different through Eastern and Western eyes.Also, the movie suffers from a language problem. It is in Mandarin, which Chow Yun Fat, and I think Michelle Yeoh, don't speak (they're Cantonese). Their pronunciation and line delivery sometimes sound a bit wonky as a result of their having to learn a new language. However, I don't think this movie would have been quite the same in Cantonese, which is sharper and less lyrical than Mandarin.In summary, I think this movie is one of the greatest I have ever seen. It has everything, if one only has the eyes to see it.

Well, didn't take long to find out not everyone shared my sentiments. I guess it was to be expected. After all the hype and the waiting, the fans wanted nothing less than for George Lucas to smash a grand slam homer right out of the park, so when instead he hit a solid triple, a lot of people felt cheated and let down, and so they focused on what they didn't get more than on what was delivered.Which is a shame. Phantom Menace is a fine film in its own rights. In part, some of the complaints were because it was different from the others. Most notably, the comradeship of familiar characters was missing, the interplay between the heroes, heroines and sidekicks as they grew to trust each other and deal with their various character traits as they bounced from one close call to the next. There was no romance to speak of (unlike the great Han Solo\/Princess Leia exchanges) nor was there much humor (as in the interplay between Chewbacca and the two droids) and of course the central character is one we all know will soon transform into the evil villain of the first trilogy. In short, it simply doesn't have a lot of the key elements that everyone loved from the earlier films.But so what? Like I said, this one is different, and should be judged on its own merits. What is good about this film? For starters, the awesome effects. Let's face it, that's what MADE the Star Wars franchise, lose them, and you've just got a pretty decent space fairy tale. There's some really cool concepts, too, I especially liked the various types of Battle Droids, and would not be surprised to see this idea become reality in our own military some time in the near future. Also, you've got a deeper, darker, more serious mood. There's not too much in the way of yuks and joking around because anyone with vision can see that this particular Galaxy is headed for serious trouble. There's Natalie Portman as Queen Amidala, who, IMHO, is an even better female lead than Carrie Fisher. She's got the same strength of character, only in a different guise. Instead of a feisty, resourceful rebel Princess, she, despite being only 18 or so, leads with great dignity and poise. Darth Maul is another great character, the only downside is he wasn't given more screen time. Young Annakin Skywalker comes off just as we'd expect, he's a slave, but clearly destined to move on to much bigger things. We are left wondering just how it is this budding Jedi ends up making the choice to side with evil, not to mention how he will interact with his future wife and son. We are left hanging deliciously, wondering just what Episode Two will serve up. As for the bad, well, basically it can be summed up in three words &#150; Jar Jar Binks. Rarely has a more annoying and useless character been given so much screen time in a major movie. He's funny &#133;.. for maybe a minute or two. Then he should have been given the boot. Yet he seems to be onscreen almost as much as Luke in the original! What on Earth for? He brings nothing to the film to justify being so prominent. Further, he turns an otherwise spectacular final battle scene into a 3 Stooges style comic farce in which he blunders about the battlefield taking out the enemy through sheer incompetence and dumb luck (maybe I should change the comic reference to Gomer Pyle). Anyway, if ever this film is subject to digital editing, Jar Jar should be `erased' from every scene where it is practical to do so. On a more minor note, I was less impressed than most by the Pod Race. Sure, it was cool but so is an Eddie Van Halen guitar solo. And both are more a case of artistic showing off than anything else. The Pod Race was special effects for its own sake, and didn't really add anything of importance to the movie.But, other than that, this was definitely a far better than average film.
