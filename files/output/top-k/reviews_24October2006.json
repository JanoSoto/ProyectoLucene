[{"date":"24 October 2006","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Robert Rodriguez, best known for the startling dichotomy of the Mariachi trilogy to the Spykids trilogy, makes studio teen horror cool here. With a cast that can't be beat, including my favorite actress of all time Famke Janssen, and a script that holds together despite its far-out premise, this movie has all the makings of a repeat viewing attraction. Most of the young cast, Josh Hartnett, Jordana Brewster, Clea Duvall, have gone on to great careers, and it kind of started here. Add in veterans like Robert Patrick, Bebe Neuwerth, Salma Hayek, and my all time favorite actress Famke Janssen, and it all clicks. The movie has enough thrills and chills to keep most horror fans engaged, and enough of a sci-fi premise to have the nerds drooling. Plus some partial nudity and a lot of sex talk adds a lot. I always enjoy this flick, seeing as its on television every few months. It never gets old, kind of like The One and Drop Dead Gorgeous. As for it being a sell-out, it was Rodriguez's first major studio flick, and had the master of sell-out Kevin Williamson writing it. But it still rocks.

Not only is the film divided into two nearly unintelligible segments, it is further broken down during the final section by portraying a down-on-his luck director (Paul Giamatti, THE ILLUSIONIST) who is obviously a doppelganger of Solondz himself.Overflowing with apathy, Storytelling has two distinct parts fiction and nonfiction. In fiction, which launches the film, we're introduced to Vi (Selma Blair, HELLBOY), a young New Jersey college student involved in a writing\/literature class that concentrates on critique. Her boyfriend Marcus (Leo Fitzpatrick, THE WIRE TV series) has cerebral palsy and it appears the only reason she's with him is because of her apathy toward college life and those that haunt its halls. The teacher of the class is a forbidding black man named Mr. Scott (Robert Wisdom, also from THE WIRE), a Pulitzer Prize winner who's flat affect and bored demeanor heaves a heavy shadow over the class. But apathy attracts apathy in Solondz story, so Vi and Mr. Scott have a sexual encounter, if for no other reason than to slip out of their routines and into one another. There's actually some interesting dark sexual comedy here, but it quickly dissolves.Perhaps fiction was part nonfiction, too, as one could easily see Solondz sitting in a class, reading stories that get sledgehammer critiques.The second and final portion of Storytelling is nonfiction. Here we find Toby Oxman (Giamatti), a man who can't seem to finish anything. But when he discovers a young kid named Scooby (Mark Webber, THE MEMORY THIEF) who mirrors Toby's own apathy toward life, the wannabe film maker believes he's found a new calling to make a documentary about society. John Goodman (O BROTHER, WHERE ART THOU?) stars as Scooby's father, a big man that pushes his kids and family too hard to become his ideal nuclear family. His wife Fern (July Hagerty, AIRPLANE) is just as disinterested in life as the rest of the cast, but hides it behind a facade of smiles. The only empathetic character in the Webber household is the maid Consuelo (Lupe Ontiveros, TORTILLA HEAVEN) who gets fired because she shows some interest in life. Toby Oxman films all of the Webber household people but keeps his focus on Scooby, whom he sees strictly as a character subject.That the film ends abruptly with the death of Scooby's family, and we still see no emotional response from him, only adds to the viewer's anger that there's no one in the film to care about. No protagonist that we can get behind. No angst from any of the characters. They are blobs of human flesh pooling around each other in uninteresting ways.Directing a movie about apathy has been done before; American BEAUTY is probably the most notable of these. But the characters were multifaceted and you cared about them. Here in Storytelling, the premise seems to be filming a flick about apathy just for the sake of showing apathy.

One doesn't normally associate him with comedy, but he's a pretty versatile actor, and can play a lot more characters than Mafia-type thugs. He's also a pretty darned good comedian, as he first proved way back in the early '80s with Rupert Pupkin in The King of Comedy.Anyway, De Niro and Ben Stiller provide a lot of laughs in this modern-day comedy. No sense going into detail as there are plenty of other reviews here. I hate to see the hero of a movie being a character who is chronic liar (Stiller's Greg Focker) but that's not unusual in the world of films. That, and Blythe Danner's excessive use of God's name as exclamations gets annoying. Other than that, it's a fun movie that turned out to be a hit and justifiably so. I imagine you could get a lot of laughs from watching this over and over. That would be better than watching the sequel.
