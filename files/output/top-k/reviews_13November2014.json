However, this is clearly one of Williams' lesser films. The situation felt contrived and silly, merely an excuse for Williams to engage in puerile antics.

Of course Robin Williams does a fine job, but Diane Lane and Bill Cosby in particular turn in good performances as well. Jennifer Lopez and Fran Drescher also show up, but more as eye candy for horny boys than anything. Looking at recent cases involving teachers sleeping with their students, the implications of the scenes involving Jack and those two characters might come off as irresponsible, the subject matter is handled as tastefully as possible (as opposed to something like THAT'S MY BOY, in which Adam Sandler plays a man-child of sorts). I did find one scene between Fran Drescher and Robin Williams as tender, but nothing more.Given the circumstances surrounding Jack's life, you might think that the film goes for a tearjerker of an ending, but it doesn't. Still, I do feel like the closing speech, which sums up the message of the movie, was tacked on and unnecessary to a degree. It was a sentiment better expressed in Williams' earlier movies, such as DEAD POETS SOCIETY.

I knew Robin Williams was a great actor, but this has to be the best dramatic role I've ever seen him in so far (keeping in mind that I haven't seen quite a few of his dramatic roles yet). He lays his emotions bare as T.S. Garp, the bastard son of Jenny Fields. The film is quite an emotional roller coaster, taking you from laughter, to shock and tears at various points throughout the long, but never dragging, narrative. It basically the entire life of Garp squeezed into about 130 minutes, consisting of snapshots and various episodes that he experiences as he gets older. His mother Jenny, played by Glenn Close (in her film debut) with motherly tenderness and wisdom, was also highly impressive. Even though it's Garp's story, his mother plays an integral part in shaping his worldview, which is unique to say the least. There's so many great moments in this film, that it's impossible to pick just one. Although, there is a couple scenes towards the end that were particularly poignant in the wake of Robin Williams' untimely death. I'm not afraid to admit that I cried a couple of times. There was even some of the relationship drama that struck a chord with me due to recent events in my own life that I'm still getting over. In short, I think this is one of the best films I've ever seen in my life, and is certain to be one of my favorites in years to come. On a side note, John Lithgow has a outstanding supporting turn as a trans-woman named Roberta. While Jared Leto might have done an excellent job in DALLAS BUYERS CLUB, Lithgow did it first and better in my opinion. There's also a small cameo by Amanda Plummer, in what was probably one of her first roles. So, it is with no hesitations that I can wholeheartedly recommend this film. It is honest, unpretentious and sentimental without being sappy (for the most part). A must-see for Robin Williams fans and cinephiles in general.

Robin Williams is Parry, a homeless man whose life was severely affected by that act. As the film progresses, the two of them come together and help each other deal with loss in their own ways.

Jeff Bridges and Robin Williams also give outstanding performances that are properly nuanced and full of emotional depth. There is also several really funny scenes which showcase Robin Williams gift for humor, despite not being as manic as he can be. Here, his insanity is a cover for some deeply held emotion regarding his past (not unlike many comics in real life whose gift for humor masks very real pain). Jeff Bridges also has pain of his own, in the form of guilt over that incident which resulted from his on-air comment. The journey on which these two go, represented in Parry's mind by a quest for a holy grail (Monty Python?) was fascinating and gripping. Gilliam also gets to indulge in some fantastical imagery, as Parry imagines himself a knight with an evil, fiery Red Knight in pursuit of him.

In what is probably his finest performance, Robin Williams plays Vladimir Ivanoff, a Russian saxophone player for the circus who defects while on tour in New York City (at a Bloomingdale's, no less). Even though there is some necessary character establishment in Russia, the movie is largely concerned with his experience as an immigrant and how he adjusts to life here in the United States. During the course of the movie, he meets a black man named Lionel, who is the first person to take him in, and an Italian immigrant named Lucy (Maria Conchita Alonso).What struck me the most about the film, other than the outstanding message, was the degree to which Robin Williams immersed himself in this role. When he was on screen, it was like I was watching an actual Russian saxophone player instead of him playing a character. As a side note, he actually did learn how to speak Russian and play the saxophone for this film. Beyond that, the movie just felt real in the sense that you could believe that an immigrant would conceivably go through many of the situations portrayed in the film. To many of them, there must be this whimsy and fantastical aura when viewed from afar, but things turn out to be quite different once thrust into it headfirst as Vladimir is. Among the things I really took out of the film is the sense of community that immigrants and minorities have, something which they bring from their own life experiences.There is also the central issue of not taking freedom for granted, as I'm sure many Americans born here would understand. Seeing as this film was made during, and in the context of, the Cold War, life was understandably difficult in countries with dictatorial regimes and the lure of America, a free country, was certainly a strong one and still is to this day. That, I feel, is what should be taken away after watching this film most of all. The United States is a nation of immigrants, and we should all treat each other with respect and appreciate the freedoms we enjoy.Looking at the film from other perspectives, the technical aspects of the film are all excellent, though not flashy. Paul Mazursky allows the drama to take center stage, and it benefits the film considerably. There was also a great score with a jazz tinge, which gave off a whimsical tone at first, but also conveyed a sense of longing. Acting-wise, of course Robin Williams gives an incredibly moving portrayal of a Russian immigrant, but Maria Conchita Alonso also does a great job as his fellow immigrant girlfriend. There are also a couple of small roles played by familiar faces (to me, at least). Overall, this is a remarkably tender and uplifting drama (with some laughs as well) that has a great message and Robin Williams' best performance. This is a film that deserves to be seen, so that we can all be reminded not to take our freedoms for granted.

Beyond that, the movie just felt real in the sense that you could believe that an immigrant would conceivably go through many of the situations portrayed in the film. To many of them, there must be this whimsy and fantastical aura when viewed from afar, but things turn out to be quite different once thrust into it headfirst as Vladimir is. Among the things I really took out of the film is the sense of community that immigrants and minorities have, something which they bring from their own life experiences.There is also the central issue of not taking freedom for granted, as I'm sure many Americans born here would understand. Seeing as this film was made during, and in the context of, the Cold War, life was understandably difficult in countries with dictatorial regimes and the lure of America, a free country, was certainly a strong one and still is to this day. That, I feel, is what should be taken away after watching this film most of all. The United States is a nation of immigrants, and we should all treat each other with respect and appreciate the freedoms we enjoy.Looking at the film from other perspectives, the technical aspects of the film are all excellent, though not flashy. Paul Mazursky allows the drama to take center stage, and it benefits the film considerably. There was also a great score with a jazz tinge, which gave off a whimsical tone at first, but also conveyed a sense of longing. Acting-wise, of course Robin Williams gives an incredibly moving portrayal of a Russian immigrant, but Maria Conchita Alonso also does a great job as his fellow immigrant girlfriend. There are also a couple of small roles played by familiar faces (to me, at least). Overall, this is a remarkably tender and uplifting drama (with some laughs as well) that has a great message and Robin Williams' best performance.

In what is probably his finest performance, Robin Williams plays Vladimir Ivanoff, a Russian saxophone player for the circus who defects while on tour in New York City (at a Bloomingdale's, no less). Even though there is some necessary character establishment in Russia, the movie is largely concerned with his experience as an immigrant and how he adjusts to life here in the United States. During the course of the movie, he meets a black man named Lionel, who is the first person to take him in, and an Italian immigrant named Lucy (Maria Conchita Alonso).What struck me the most about the film, other than the outstanding message, was the degree to which Robin Williams immersed himself in this role. When he was on screen, it was like I was watching an actual Russian saxophone player instead of him playing a character. As a side note, he actually did learn how to speak Russian and play the saxophone for this film.

Robin Williams is Chris Nielsen, a doctor who suffers a great tragedy and ultimately is taken by fate as well. While in the afterlife, he goes on a journey to reunite himself with his wife. First of all, let me say that I don't subscribe to a belief in an afterlife, but the fact that the movie treats it as an objective thing wasn't really a problem for me. What was a problem was that the whole story was set up so quickly that the core relationship you're supposed to care about wasn't believable. Sure, the screenwriter covered themselves by having Chris and his wife (Annabella Sciorra) be soulmates, but this felt like a cop-out from actually doing some character development and building a believable relationship. However, the sentiment expressed by Chris' journey is an understandable one. It tells the story of a man who literally goes to hell and back just to be with the one he loves. Aside from that, the best part of the movie is the visual flair with which the afterlife is realized. One of Chris' passions is painting, and his early experiences there are very much painting-like. This film won the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects in 1999, and from what I could tell, it was definitely deserved. The effects weren't necessarily realistic, but they were impressionistic and artistic. On the downside, the metaphysical content and ideas are practically shoved down the viewers throats. There are many conversations laden with language that's supposed to sound like it's important, but the story never really lives up to these lofty ideas. Also, when you create a fantasy world there are often rules established to that everything isn't pure chaos. Here, there are some rules established but the film doesn't stick to them. At times, it's unclear how the afterlife works, which could be confusing to some people (assuming they even believe in such a thing). Overall, this is a very spiritual film that aspires to greatness, but is only OK. Robin Williams and the rest of the cast give excellent performances, but the visuals only serve to paint over the cracks in the story.

This movie, more than any other that I can remember, is the best example of a live action cartoon, in the best sense of the term. Watching it was like a cartoon come to life. It was truly wonderful and extremely funny to watch characters behaving as if they were in one, from their movement to the way they spoke. And none exemplify this better than Robin Williams in the title role, who channels his unbridled comic talent into a completely dedicated performance which is equally hilarious and touching. The story is fairly simple, though. Popeye rows into the town of Sweethaven looking for his 'Pap.' While there, he (and the audience) find out about how messed up that town really is. They have an absurd amount of taxes, and everyone is kept in fear of a mysterious Commodore and Captain Bluto, who run the town. He also meets Olive Oyl, played (at times screechingly) by Shelley Duvall (who also fits her role perfectly). This film is also a musical, and there several catchy numbers which have the capacity to stick in your head if you aren't careful. If I have any complaints, it's that Shelley Duvall isn't as good a singer as she is an actress, but nothing she does really ruins the picture. The biggest flaw in the film is direction the narrative takes about two thirds of the way through. I also thought that Bluto wasn't really given his due as a character.

However, it's not just a comedy and in fact, the tone of the picture is more serious than you might think going in. While Robin Williams does get to let loose in several hilarious scenes as Air Force DJ Adrian Cronauer, there is an undercurrent of seriousness which seeks to examine the effect of the Vietnam War on Vietnamese citizens, as well as what the US troops endured. It's not particularly graphic, but it didn't really need to be. Up to the time this film was released there were several highly acclaimed films on the subject already. What sets this one apart is the character of Adrian Cronauer, who uses comedy to lighten the spirits of the men serving their country overseas. Still, the film isn't without its flaws. There is a romantic subplot that seemed shoehorned in just to give the film some extra conflict. Also, by virtue of coming later, none of the messages the film tries to get across were that original either. Still, it's worth seeing this movie for Robin Williams' performance alone. Forrest Whitaker also gives a good supporting turn as Cronauer's Army buddy\/escort. Another outstanding part of this film was the soundtrack, full of great 1960's tunes. There is also a moving sequence set to Louis Armstong's What a Wonderful World. On historical accuracy, apparently not all of the events in the film happened as described and some were surely invented for dramatic purposes. However, that doesn't really hurt the film too much. Is this Robin Williams' absolute best film? No, but considering what came immediately before, this collaboration with Barry Levinson (who he would team up with a couple more times in his career) was a step in the right direction.

It stars Robin Williams as John Keating, an English teacher, with Robert Sean Leonard and Ethan Hawke as two of the core group of students. I went into this film knowing a little about the plot from various clips on the internet, e.g., the famous Oh captain, my captain line. I was also aware about the fate of a character, although I didn't know which one until watching it. I was generally very impressed with the film, and Robin Williams' performance in particular. The story is one that had the potential to be very clichéd and overly sentimental, but the themes discussed within were approached earnestly and backed up with some great performances. Robin Williams is especially great as the English teacher, whose unique worldview (at least in the stodgy prep school environment) and unconventional teaching methods inspire the boys to make the most of their lives and dare to break the mold. The film follows several of these boys who are inspired to seize the day in various ways. Robert Sean Leonard's character pursues his dream of acting and another character, Knox Overstreet, pursues a girl that he loves despite the threat of her boyfriend finding out. Together, the boys bring back a poetry reading group originally started by Keating, called the Dead Poets Society (hence, the title of the film). This wasn't actually the point of the film, but more of a jumping-off point. The wonder of the film is to see how the boys develop and change for the better under Keating's influence. I can't say enough how much I loved the message. That being said, there are a couple of areas worth talking about which aren't as great. One of them is that given the large cast of characters, more time could have been spent developing them, although what's there was adequate. There is also a climactic scene which, while still handled tastefully, felt a little emotionally manipulative. Overall, this has to be the best of Robin Williams' dramatic roles that I've seen so far. It's an engaging, thought-provoking and moving film about making the most of your life, even if the setting is a bit overused. Highly recommended.

When his son Val comes home for a visit, he tells his father that he is getting married, but to the daughter of a conservative Senator. The comedy of errors that ensues has to be seen to be believed, and in my mind was as funny as the original. Robin Williams was very effective in playing the straight man to Nathan Lane's hysterical queen, and both played off of each other very well. Gene Hackman was also pretty hilarious as a stereotypically backwards-minded right-winger. Overall, while a remake of LA CAGE AUX FOLLES might not have been necessary, THE BIRDCAGE is pretty funny, if a little long-winded in parts. It has a great cast who all perform very well together, with special mention going to Hank Azaria as Armand and Albert's butler Agador. It also had a fine soundtrack as well.

The best example of this is the character of Red, who in the original novel is a red-headed Irishman. This is referred to jokingly by Morgan Freeman in one of his first conversations with Tim Robbins; when Andy asks why people call him Red, Red responds Maybe it's because I'm Irish..On top of Freeman's obvious ability, the casting decision makes sense because it adds an extra layer of meaning to the character. Red is one of the few black characters we come across; while he applies himself in different ways, he is as much of an outsider as Andy DuFresne. This is borne out by his remarks about institutionalization, which are laughed off by his fellow inmates. Red may be well-connected when it comes to smuggling things in, but otherwise he is just as lonely as Andy.Shawshank approaches the theme of institutionalization with great grace and dexterity. Because the story takes place over three decades, the temptation would be to canter through the plot points and cut straight to Andy's escape - you could even stage the entire story in flashback. Instead, Darabont allows the film to unfold at a gentle, gradual pace, reflecting the mind-set of the characters. They don't realize how trapped they are until it's too late, just as we don't realize that two-and-a-half hours has passed until the credits have begun to roll.The characters reflect the different extents and effects of institutionalization. Brooks has built his entire identity around his books and role in the prison; he is so afraid of this being taken away that he attempts to kill William Sadler's character so he can stay inside. Red is aware of how trapped he is, and shares Brooks' fears, being unsure that he could get things for Andy on the outside. But at the same time, he refuses to let himself be vulnerable, trying to play the system and constantly getting turned down for parole. Andy allows himself to be vulnerable and endures all the pain that it brings him, sustained by the knowledge of his innocence and the hope that he will escape.Shawshank is perhaps the most powerful depiction of hope in all of cinema. The original short story, Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption, was subtitled 'Hope Springs Eternal'. The film returns to hope and the celebration of the human spirit like a leitmotif, and succeeds because it retains Andy's humanity in all its many shades. While he is very different to the other prisoners, he is never presented as a saint or goody-goody, smiling gormless in the face of maddening torment. This makes his endurance all the more powerful we recognize our faults in his moments of weakness, and aspire to his inner moral strength.The film has attracted many Christian interpretations - in fact, in my review of John Carpenter's The Thing, I called it a poster child for Christianity. It's not hard to see why, considering its celebration of inner strength and devotion, and its overall arc of good triumph over evil against the greatest odds. While Andy has been called a Christ figure, he's just as close to the character of Daniel in the Old Testament he finds himself in a strange land against his will, and in order to survive he applies his natural talents to the service of his temporal masters. Through his labors the people around him benefit and the system is eventually changed for the better - albeit through pain, suffering and several deaths.An equally intriguing interpretation comes from Mark Kermode, who authored a BFI Modern Classic on the film in 2003. In a video discussing cinematic depictions of Richard Nixon, Kermode made the argument that Warden Norton (played brilliantly by Bob Gunton) is an allegory for Nixon, with Andy's prison term matching Nixon's political career. Norton begins reaching out for friendship (Nixon seeking to be elected), then becomes the corrupt leader (beginning in the year that Kennedy was shot), and finally descends into paranoia and disgrace, culminating in a more literal suicide than Nixon offered us.Whether you believe these interpretations or not, Shawshank is a terrific piece of dramatic film-making which soars on the strengths of its main performers. Tim Robbins perfectly captures Andy's distant, ethereal quality while retaining his wry and infectious sense of humor. Morgan Freeman's performance may well be responsible for his subsequent type-casting, but he matches Robbins beat for beat, offsetting hope with world-weariness and guilt. There's also great support from two actors who would subsequently work with Darabont again - William Sadler (who appears in The Green Mile) and James Whitmore (The Majestic).The Shawshank Redemption may not be entirely worthy of its number one ranking on IMDb, but it remains a really terrific piece of drama let down only by its final scene. In every other aspect it's a masterpiece, as a character piece, a treatise on hope and a beautifully paced and mounted Stephen King adaptation. It remains a must-see for all film fans of penchant or persuasion, earning its status as a modern classic and securing a warm place in our hearts.

While soon after the initial release of the film, the audience and critic response wasn't very good at all. Having been played on television for roughly fifteen years now, the fan base and the overall grade of the film has drastically went upwards. I remember in the 1990s often seeing this film on television and watching it many many times. There was no watching it too much. The film flows so naturally and in my opinion there is never a dull scene, not a single one. The following is my review of Dumb and Dumber.The film was written by Peter Farrelly, Bobby Farrelly, and Bennett Yellin. The Farrelly Brothers are also known for other hilarious films such as There's Something About Mary, and Me, Myself & Irene. This story follows two friends Harry(Jeff Daniels) and Lloyd(Jim Carrey) as they travel across country from Rhode Island to Aspen, Colorado where Lloyd returns a briefcase that a customer left in Lloyd's limousine he was driving. The silly happenings that occur on the way to Aspen are downright hilarious. This movie has so many quotable lines, that it was difficult to pick my favorite for the summary of my review. As I said in my first paragraph, this film flows smoothly, never a dull moment, never a moment when you ask yourself where are the laughs at?. This film is non stop comedy and just an overall amazing joyride to watch. I sat down to watch the film again because they are finally making a true sequel to this amazing film. I've watched this film so many times over the years(easily 300 times if I had to put a number on it) and I can honestly say I still never get bored with this film. After 20 years that says a great deal about a film if it can have that effect on you. The Farrelly Brothers delivered a fabulous comedy on their first outing, and a film I will never forget.The film was also directed by The Farrelly Brothers. This was the Farrelly Brothers first outing directing a film, they had written some things in the past, but never directed. This duo was unstoppable in the 1990s, with not only this film but several others as well. The film was not very easy to get off the ground, and it actually took a few years because studios thought the script was garbage and that it would never sell. New Line Cinema came along and gave the film a chance, although still worried about the idea. The studio gave the directors a list of 25 actors who they wanted to see cast as Harry and Lloyd, but all of the actors said no. Finally, they went to Jim Carrey to ask about the role of Lloyd, and he did accept the role, but it wasn't until after his wildly popular Ace Ventura film was released, thus giving him much more money. They wanted someone a little less unknown for the other role of Harry and someone who could play nicely off of Carrey. In came Jeff Daniels, who is such a fantastic actor. Daniels was worried abut Carrey stealing the show, but then after reading the script realized that Harry is just as important as Lloyd if not more so. The rest is history, and we are left with two amazing performances from Jeff Daniels and Jim Carrey. They did in fact get along so much together, and made the film that much better. It is even said that Carrey ad libbed a great deal of his famous lines. For young first time directors to allow their cast to do this and have fun with the roles made the film that much better. The Farrelly Brothers set out to deliver fans some great laughs, and in the end turned out one of the greatest comedies ever made. Not many first time directors can say that.The soundtrack on this film is so amazing as well. Times have of coursed changed in the 20 years since the film first was released, but looking back hearing those great songs from artists like Apache Indian, Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds, The Proclaimers, Echobelly, and of course Crash Test Dummies is such a joy. The soundtrack added so much to this comedy classic, and should not be overlooked.In closing, Dumb and Dumber set out to deliver some laughs, but little did the Farrelly Brother know that their first feature length film would become so widely popular and known as a true comedy classic. Fans who want to get back to roots of real comedy instead of the phony comedy being pushed today, this is a fantastic film to start with. The comedy is witty and subtle, which even makes you stop and think at times. The joy this film will bring you is nearly unparalleled in this comedy genre. With the newest and first real sequel to the original Dumb and Dumber film set to release within hours of me writing this review, it is a must to see this classic film before going out to watch the sequel.10\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"13 November 2014","score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Dumb and Dumber is one of the funniest films ever made, and is truly my favorite comedy film.

The concept, blended with the artistry of Kubrick, had me breathlessly staring at my computer screen as the credits ran. Kubrick's work seems to translate less as a film, but more as an artistic piece. The plot follows no specific points and the narration is minimal, yet the audience leaves with such a deep range of emotion and curiosity. The film revolves less around the evolution of its characters, but instead dwells on an overarching concept of the evolution of mankind in its entirety. Scenes like the apes learning how to use tools to kill the opposition, Bowman disabling the all powerful HAL-9000, and the final act where the star child looks over the earth all encompass Kubrick's intentions while utilizing his signature style.The dialogue, or lack thereof, sets the tone for this film. In the first half hour, there are no words spoken. The same can be said for the last half hour. In fact, around 88 minutes are silent. That is more than half of the movie engulfed in the sound of silence. But the silence does not take away from the movie, as many superficial critics would argue, it enriches it in great dividends. Kubrick uses this incredibly eerie feeling to allow the film to progress with the absence of narration. We should not rely on the few words that we hear, but rather allow our own imagination and curiosity to emulate feelings that Kubrick fulfills with this style. Many viewers say that this creates a boring and slow-moving film, and I have to admit that some parts are a bit sluggish, but these empty sequences filled with classical music or heavy breathing adds an almost cryptic element to man's perception on the unknown universe. Everything appears so alien, so incredibly vast and remote. We are allowed to ponder Kubrick's profound intentions with such a minimalistic approach. This cryptic element is also aided by the choice of music in the film. Kubrick infuses a remarkable soundtrack with beautiful shooting techniques to create a void that only our interpretation can fill. As we cycle through various ships in space to the tune of The Blue Danube Waltz, we fall into a sort of trance, filled with fascination and awe over the complexity of space and what man has done to explore it. But when we first see the monolith on the moon, Kubrick viciously uses Requiem for Soprano, Mezzo Soprano, Two Mixed Choirs & Orchestra to create an almost disturbing feeling within us. The contrast of voices and tones combined with the unearthly presence of the monolith forces us into such an uncomfortable perception of the astronauts exploring the moons surface. Kubrick inflicts so much emotion with the use of classical scores such as these, having more meaning than the words of the characters themselves.Everything that surrounds this film creates such an aura of beauty. Showing ships in space for fifteen minutes or playing music to a black screen has no effect on the outcome of the film, but it creates such an elegant atmosphere that Kubrick uses to enhance our outlook on 2001. That is what pushes this film past many others, the effect that even minor elements provide for its audience. But what really sealed everything for me was the ending. Out of nowhere, Kubrick throws in scenes so profound and unexpected that it forces the audience to ask questions. It forces us to ponder what Kubrick truly wanted to portray. And ultimately, it forces us to examine human evolution and its place among the universe. Kubrick did not create 2001 as a film to 'entertain'. The whole premise of the movie revolves around our conscious understanding rather than a superficial plot line that grants us immediate satisfaction.

The first is still the best, but this is scarier. The whole story with Loomis and Michael's niece continues in what is the second best sequel in my opinion (after H2O). Aside from this being the scariest, it is also very well-done. The movie was rushed in production taking just a few months to make, but that's not a big deal. There are some flaws, but the movie sucks you so far into it, you aren't that intrigued by the flaws. What makes this great is how good the actors are. Danielle Harris is amazing as Jamie Lloyd (even better than in Halloween 4) and Donald Pleasance does his best Dr. Loomis portrayal. One year after Jamie seemingly adapts Michael's powers, she lives in a children's mental clinic and is mute, while Michael was unconscious in a shack. He wakes up and is out to kill his niece, who senses Michael and can save his rage. Rage boils inside Dr. Loomis as he tries to put an end to Michael Myers once and for all.But I can see why some people would not care for this. Jamie is scared and screams throughout the whole movie. So that may annoy some viewers. But she is such a good actress, you have no other choice but to feel for her and pray she survives. Many people also didn't like Michael becoming a Jason Voorhees-like character. If anything, Jason is a rip-off on Michael since Halloween came out before Friday The 13th. There are also some unanswered questions with an odd tattoo and a man dressed in black with metal-toed boots. All that is answered in Halloween 6, which sucked!

Not only does it star some amazing actors\/actresses, but despite the dated and nostalgic setting it has a timeless message when parents forget their kids are there, well, kids still see, hear - and pick up on - everything adults do. Everyone was a kid at some point, and many of us can recall times when our parents acted more like teenagers than caregivers. The difference is, in The Ice Storm, the carelessness of the fictional parents leads to the horrible death of a little boy.Discos, key parties, drugs, booze, free love, it's all the thing in 1973 as the latest trend. The problem is, that kind of thing spreads to a middle-class community and starts messing up families and friendships. The true sufferers though are the kids. Wendy (Christina Ricci) is only fourteen but enjoys copying her parents' lifestyle, leading to her getting sort of a bad reputation. Libbits is just a kid but left home alone by her parents in a house filled with drugs. Sandy is obsessed with violence, Mikey is hardly noticed and Francis is always getting high.One night during a key party in the neighborhood, every one of the characters learns something shocking about the way the swinger lifestyle is; the sexual revolution isn't all it's cracked up to be. Just when it looks like things might change, one of the younger neighborhood children has gone outside into a deadly ice storm... and it was because, to the parents, he hardly existed until it mattered most of all.The Ice Storm really hits you at the very ending, when one of the parents breaks down crying at the wheel of his car in front of his family. He realizes that their own negligence caused the death of a child, all over a key party, a stupid game for adults who don't want to grow up. Wendy suddenly realizes how childish her behavior has been, and the parents realize that the whole time they were getting after their children for perverse behavior it was all being learned from the parents themselves. Kids pick things up. The Ice Storm is just a lesson for us all, a worst-case-scenario of sorts, set in a time not so long ago.The soundtrack was beautiful, the acting was excellent and the plot was very original (it was adapted into an episode of the show Cold Case titled The Key). And while the sexual revolution was several decades ago, today is the tech revolution. Adults are using phones more and more without communicating in anything but texts. Maybe The Ice Storm's message is more universal than meets the eye, because it's true, kids do pick up on their parents' behavior, and it's not always a good thing.

Not only does it star some amazing actors\/actresses, but despite the dated and nostalgic setting it has a timeless message when parents forget their kids are there, well, kids still see, hear - and pick up on - everything adults do. Everyone was a kid at some point, and many of us can recall times when our parents acted more like teenagers than caregivers. The difference is, in The Ice Storm, the carelessness of the fictional parents leads to the horrible death of a little boy.Discos, key parties, drugs, booze, free love, it's all the thing in 1973 as the latest trend. The problem is, that kind of thing spreads to a middle-class community and starts messing up families and friendships. The true sufferers though are the kids. Wendy (Christina Ricci) is only fourteen but enjoys copying her parents' lifestyle, leading to her getting sort of a bad reputation. Libbits is just a kid but left home alone by her parents in a house filled with drugs. Sandy is obsessed with violence, Mikey is hardly noticed and Francis is always getting high.One night during a key party in the neighborhood, every one of the characters learns something shocking about the way the swinger lifestyle is; the sexual revolution isn't all it's cracked up to be. Just when it looks like things might change, one of the younger neighborhood children has gone outside into a deadly ice storm... and it was because, to the parents, he hardly existed until it mattered most of all.The Ice Storm really hits you at the very ending, when one of the parents breaks down crying at the wheel of his car in front of his family. He realizes that their own negligence caused the death of a child, all over a key party, a stupid game for adults who don't want to grow up. Wendy suddenly realizes how childish her behavior has been, and the parents realize that the whole time they were getting after their children for perverse behavior it was all being learned from the parents themselves. Kids pick things up. The Ice Storm is just a lesson for us all, a worst-case-scenario of sorts, set in a time not so long ago.The soundtrack was beautiful, the acting was excellent and the plot was very original (it was adapted into an episode of the show Cold Case titled The Key). And while the sexual revolution was several decades ago, today is the tech revolution. Adults are using phones more and more without communicating in anything but texts. Maybe The Ice Storm's message is more universal than meets the eye, because it's true, kids do pick up on their parents' behavior, and it's not always a good thing.
