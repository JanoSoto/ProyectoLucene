This was very interesting to me because people don't usually record that much of a film using Dutch-angle. This really did a good job at informing you the characters are really screwed up. Then you have the black and white clip that were also dutch angle.

However to harvest enough protein the team have genetically altered the Shark's brains making them five times their normal size & as a side effect making the Shark's much smarter. The Shark's organise an ambush & manage to start flooding the Aquatica letting them swim inside, the team inside quickly realise the Shark's want to kill & eat them & somehow must find a way to to get to the surface...This American Australian co-production was directed by Rennt Harlin & is probably the best Shark based 'Creature Feature' out there (Jaws (1975) doesn't count as a mere creature feature as it's so much more) & the type of film the Sci-Fi Channel can only dream of making, Deep Blue is a real guilty pleasure of mine & I have throughly enjoyed it every time I have watched it. There's nothing deep or meaningful here & it has it's silly moments but as a blockbusting piece of entertainment you can't go wrong. At just over 100 minutes it's fast moving, there are a couple of surprise moments as character's you don't expect to get killed off, there's plenty of set-pieces as the intelligent Shark's lay traps for & chase people, there's action, some thrills, some suspense, some horror & gore, some neat effects & a fairly satisfying outcome. As a whole Deep Blue Sea works very well although it has it's silly moments like the cook trapped in an oven in a flooded kitchen & the Shark somehow turns the cooker on & while cutting his way out with an axe he doesn't even create a single spark as that would have blown him up, then there's the scene in which a scientist puts some Shark brain protein on dead human brain tissue & it 'sparks' back to life which is just plain ridiculous but these are small quibbles & it's very easy to go with the film & enjoy it for what it is. The character's are pretty good with Burrows scientist in particular coming across well, the dialogue is fine & easy to follow, the Shark's come across as clever but not too clever which gives them a nice edge & it's just a really great horror thriller with Shark's, in fact you could say Deep Blue Sea is a cross between Jaws & Alien (1979) with Shark's replacing the alien as they hunt down corridors.Some really good big budget monster films came out in 1999 including this, The Mummy (1999) & Lake Placid (1999) & Deep Blue Sea is as good as any of them in my opinion. There's a wholly exploitative scene where Saffron Burrows takes her wet-suit off to reveal her panties & bra in order to insulate herself against an electric shock which stands-out as being odd (if a giant Shark is attacking you would you take your clothes off?) but still much appreciated by those who are fans of a fine female body. There are a few nice touches & gags for horror fans including the license plate pulled from the Shark's teeth in this is the same as the one found inside the Shark in the original Jaws while the three Shark's in Deep Blue Sea are killed in the same way & in the same order (first one is blown up like in Jaws, second one is electrocuted like in Jaws 2 (1979) & the third is blown up like in Jaws 3-D (1983)) as in the first three Jaws films. There's some decent gore including ripped in half bodies, a bitten off arm & some blood splatter. Surprisingly I personally think that there's some nice tension, some surprises & a bit of suspense too, I mean it's not amazing but at least it's not dull & I think it manages to evoke a few emotions from the viewer.With a supposed budget of about $78,000,000 this did alright at the box-office, the production values are high & the CGI effects are mostly very good although it is a very wet film with water in virtually every scene. Shot mainly in Mexico. The acting is pretty good from a decent cast, Saffron Burrows is good & she looks great too, Thomas Jane is alright while even LL Cool J doesn't irritate like I thought he would while Samual L. Jackson is always watchable in this sort film.Deep Blue Sea is the best Shark themed 'Creature Feature' out there bar none, I throughly enjoyed it from start to finish, sure it's not deep & it has it's silly moments but the positives far outweigh the negatives which are more minor quibbles than full blown criticisms. I definitely recommend this to any creature feature fans, fans of killer Shark films or anyone just wanting a fast paced horror thriller.

It's simply such a charming and delightful movie that you just can't help but liking.It's being somewhat of a screwball comedy but since this movie got made in 1953, it's not quite the same as the usual average screwball comedy, made at the peak of the genre, during the '30's and '40's. You could say that the movie is being less goofy and is more about the hearth and warmth of the movie, that makes this movie such a charming and delightful one to watch.Of course you could really say that the movie helped to made a charming one because of the great presence of Audrey Hepburn in it. You could say that this movie really was the breakthrough movie for Audrey Hepburn. Not only because she won the Oscar for it but also because it was the first time that she was playing the female lead within a movie. She had appeared in several movies before but mostly in some supporting roles. Sometimes she was in a movie for only a couple of seconds. What a waste of such talent and beauty, or at least of course it seems that way now. She is just the perfect woman to me, with her girl like charm and natural beauty and she spoke quite well Dutch as well, as she also demonstrates briefly toward the end of the movie. So if you look anything- or are like Audrey Hepburn, you can drop me a line anytime. The modern Audrey Hepburn of this time and age is really Keira Knightley, who can also always drop me a line at anytime by the way. Not only do they look similar from certain angles but both also seem to have something very natural over them and also act that way, though Knightley broke through at even an earlier age and seems to be more versatile as an actress.But of course we also really shouldn't forget about Gregory Peck in this movie. He was already being somewhat of a star at the time, though he probably has never shined more in a romantic role. He handles the comedy, drama and romance in this movie all very well and believable. I also liked Eddie Albert in this movie, who probably provided the movie with most of its comedy. He even got nominated for an Oscar for his role in this movie.The movie can be seen as a modern fairy tale, though modern probably doesn't apply very much anymore for an 1953 picture, but you get what I mean. It's about a princess who is on the verge of a mental breakdown and on a given night decided to go out and hang around in Rome with 'normal' people for a change, incognito. Reporter Gregory Peck soon finds out who she truly is and decided to take advantage of the situation for his own personal gain but of course soon starts to grow a soft spot for Audrey Hepburn.

It's simply such a charming and delightful movie that you just can't help but liking.It's being somewhat of a screwball comedy but since this movie got made in 1953, it's not quite the same as the usual average screwball comedy, made at the peak of the genre, during the '30's and '40's. You could say that the movie is being less goofy and is more about the hearth and warmth of the movie, that makes this movie such a charming and delightful one to watch.Of course you could really say that the movie helped to made a charming one because of the great presence of Audrey Hepburn in it. You could say that this movie really was the breakthrough movie for Audrey Hepburn. Not only because she won the Oscar for it but also because it was the first time that she was playing the female lead within a movie. She had appeared in several movies before but mostly in some supporting roles. Sometimes she was in a movie for only a couple of seconds. What a waste of such talent and beauty, or at least of course it seems that way now. She is just the perfect woman to me, with her girl like charm and natural beauty and she spoke quite well Dutch as well, as she also demonstrates briefly toward the end of the movie. So if you look anything- or are like Audrey Hepburn, you can drop me a line anytime. The modern Audrey Hepburn of this time and age is really Keira Knightley, who can also always drop me a line at anytime by the way. Not only do they look similar from certain angles but both also seem to have something very natural over them and also act that way, though Knightley broke through at even an earlier age and seems to be more versatile as an actress.But of course we also really shouldn't forget about Gregory Peck in this movie. He was already being somewhat of a star at the time, though he probably has never shined more in a romantic role. He handles the comedy, drama and romance in this movie all very well and believable. I also liked Eddie Albert in this movie, who probably provided the movie with most of its comedy. He even got nominated for an Oscar for his role in this movie.The movie can be seen as a modern fairy tale, though modern probably doesn't apply very much anymore for an 1953 picture, but you get what I mean. It's about a princess who is on the verge of a mental breakdown and on a given night decided to go out and hang around in Rome with 'normal' people for a change, incognito. Reporter Gregory Peck soon finds out who she truly is and decided to take advantage of the situation for his own personal gain but of course soon starts to grow a soft spot for Audrey Hepburn.

I had a huge collection of Punisher comics and never missed an issue, so needless to say, I was quite stoked to finally see Frank Castle hit the big screen (or I suppose I should say small screen). Unfortunately, on my first viewing of The Punisher I absolutely HATED it. I was so infuriated at how the producers played fast-and-loose with the character's back story and mythology that I actually wrote a letter to Marvel listing off my complaints about the inaccuracies in the film (Why wasn't Frank wearing the Skull Emblem? Why was he living in the sewers like a damned Mutant Ninja Turtle? He's not an ex-cop, he's an ex-Marine! Where was the War Wagon? Where was Microchip? etc., etc...)... what can I say, I was young, and Hell hath no fury like an Enraged Geek.Twenty years have gone by, I'm now a retired Comic Book Geek (I sold off the bulk of my collection, including my Punisher books, in the late '90s), and one day I came across Dolph's Punisher in the $5 bin at Wal-Mart. I had only vague memories of the film by this point so I figured Ehhh, what the hell. Now that enough time has passed that I can separate this film from the original source material (I'm still convinced that when New World Pictures obtained the Punisher license, they didn't bother to read any of the comics -- they just plugged the characters' names into a generic action movie script they already had laying around in a drawer somewhere), I actually enjoyed The Punisher a lot more than I did back in the day. It's still The Punisher in name only, and the lack of attention to detail still bugged me a little, but on its own merits, The Punisher was a pretty decent B-grade action movie. If carnage is your thing, this flick will definitely satisfy in spades. There are crazy gun battles seemingly every two minutes (using approximately 50,000 shell casings per frame of film), martial arts smackdowns with ninjas, a surprising amount of gore, and decent stuntwork for what was obviously a low budget film. I've never been a big fan of Dolph Lundgren but I have to admit he captured the haunted, tortured look in Frank Castle's eyes and he did present a hell of an imposing figure, stalking the underworld in black leather biker gear and carrying Big F'n Guns. The storyline is silly at best (in a nutshell, Frank's war against the Mafia is interrupted by the arrival of a new gang from the Japanese Yakuza who wish to muscle in on the territory, leading Frank into an uneasy truce with his former targets in order to eliminate their common enemy) but the actors play their roles well (particularly the Japanese actress who portrayed the insane Yakuza head Lady Tanaka and the ever-reliable Louis Gossett Jr., adding yet another Angry Cop role to his resume as Castle's former police partner) and the amount of pyrotechnics thrown on screen will ensure the viewer never gets bored.I still have not seen either of the two recent Punisher films that supposedly are more faithful to the character's comic book origins, but I'll probably get to them one of these days. As of right now, this early draft has shot up a few notches in my estimation and I'd say it would make a decent rental\/purchase for the action junkies out there.

I love how Kane built up from a childhood in poverty to become very successful. The film is known for its cinematography and is said to be Orson Welles breakthrough film. It is one of stories that helped changed film making and there are some beautiful scenes such as the scenes when he is taken from his parents. I didn't expect Rosebud to be the name of his childhood sled that was strange. I am glad I watched this movie and its a must see for any film buff especially since it is ranked as the number 1 film by many critics. When Welles made this film he forever changed the way to make movies.

In 1979, Sylvester Stallone returned to the big-screen as Rocky Balboa, while simultaneously serving as writer and director, in Rocky II. The film re-united Stallone with the core cast of Burt Young, Burgess Meredith, Carl Weathers and Talia Shire, was a smash success and -- at the time -- the most successful sequel to date. It's easy to see why.Picking up where the first film left off, Rocky II follows the fight between Apollo Creed and Rocky Balboa all the way to the hospital, with Creed hungry for a re-match and Balboa announcing his retirement. Things don't go exactly as planned for our hero, however, and as he tries to settle down and live a healthy lifestyle, he only comes to realize that he should embrace his fate, doing the one thing he knows best, ultimately getting back in the ring with his nemesis for Round 2.While most films end with a happy ending and never deal with the ugly aftermath, Rocky II is different in that it finds its titular character broken, beat and bruised, both physically and mentally. Although he gets to marry the love of his life, Adrian, he finds that his initial success is short-lived and struggles to stay afloat. Instead of repeating the formula of the first, this film merely serves as an extension of its predecessor, and in pretty much every respect, succeeds. Stallone is spot-on yet again, and pulling triple duty doesn't seem to phase him in the slightest. Rocky II is the perfect companion piece to Rocky and much like the first will leave engrossed and on the edge of your seat.

Cosmatos' loose 1993 remake of John Ford's Classical Hollywood era western My Darling Clementine is a relatively daft and wavy film; a piece that announces its intentions very early on with a big shoot out after some bandits inflict a large amount of cruelty on a bunch of townsfolk, whereas the original built to a climactic shootout in which characters we'd spent the entire film with rode on in and put themselves in the face of danger. Tombstone feels the need to establish, in the most basic of manners, that the 'bad guys' are the ones cackling and free willingly executing whilst a bunch of gunshots sound off for the sake of it. Tombstone veers more towards actioner than it does western, providing basic arcs for its characters and hand-holding us through whom we ought to be rooting for; but what else can you expect from the director of the second Rambo film? There's that wonderful instance in Ford's version of the story which sees a character by name of Doc Holliday, who has spent most of the opening forty minutes giving Henry Fonda's Wyatt Earp grief, have the Clementine of the title walk back into his life and put him through an emotional grinder of forlorn memories and drink. The shift in balance was stark, an informing to the audience that just because a character gives grief to someone we might assume to be whatever protagonist the film has lined up, does not mean he cannot be a human being; with respective flaws and characteristics. Tombstone tiptoes around this naturalistic air of plight, opting for archetype more often than I'd have liked whilst spending a gross amount of time plodding along before breaking off into bouts of shooting and chaos at intermittent times.The Wyatt Earp of Tombstone is played by Kurt Russell, an ex-marshal whom we know is good natured at the core due to stopping of a number of horses from having further pain and harm inflicted upon them by a certain perpetrator; an entire sequence which stands in stark comparison to the opening bandits and their attitudes towards the innocent. Journeying to the Arizona town of Tombstone with his brothers, where they hope to settle down, Earp is mangled into defending the town from the aforementioned group of a group of bullyin', gun-totin' cowboys; led by Curly Bill Brocius (Boothe). Doc Holliday is this time played by Val Kilmer, a laid-back; black-clad; smooth talking' card player whom we observe beat the system, win a card game, engage in a bar-room brawl of some nature before swinging his way outta' there with the money in one hand and the gal in the other &#x96; yes, it does feel a little fabricated. Holliday's relationship with Earp is certainly more low key in this one, something that fast-tracks character relations between the two and forces the film to focus on the cowboy gang as a primary source of antagonism, something that doesn't crop up nearly as much as Earp and Holliday's banter in Ford's version; hence the reason Tombstone comes across as the plodding piece it is.Italian born Cosmatos has his lead reflect what might very well be his own view on the material, in the sense Russell's Earp has an opinion on all the death and what's going on around him but it's a vacant feeling. A character's attempt at raising theological discussion with Russell's Earp near the beginning of the film is somewhat dismissed; amidst all the killing and hurt, it's established he doesn't care much about it &#x96; it's more so how Earp 'does' it rather than how he 'feels' about it, something that echoes the director's approach to the subject matter, in the sense he is more interested in black and white heroes and villains than looking at what these people think about those around them and particular predicaments. Holliday's easy truce with Earp is representational of this.Earp doesn't initially want the responsibility of keeping law and order. His smart and well dressed brothers stand in articulate contrast to Boothe's ragtag bunch of sloppy, roughly dressed and ugly looking bandits; although the film implores, in a bizarre manner, that practically everybody in the town is bound by a theatrical performance of a Shakespere piece; and that when the poetic nature of something so beautiful begins, everybody keeps quiet and observes. The film is one in which the focus is on men, and their relationship with one another and how they come to exist within the enclosed space of the town of Tombstone; a place that two different factions see two different, distinct futures in which they are at the respective centrefold of it all. In a film about men, men co-existing; men sorting out their relations with one another, it ought to be no surprise that the female characters are pushed to the back row - relegated to staying at home; staying silent and being seen out and about beside their man.Regardless, Tombstone isn't a bad film but it's certainly a lot less interesting than films that have taken on the story of Earp in the past. As an actioner, it works relatively well but as a character piece, it limps along for over two hours purely so that it can boil down to a showdown between good and evil. The melodramatic thunderclaps complete with lightning in the background as a key character dies about half way through exemplifies this, in the sense Cosmatos needs aid within the dramatic thunderclap sound effects to bring about more emotion out of the occurrence, rather than rely on all the previous character driven content for it to genuinely play out effectively. I like a good film about a power struggle in one locale between two groups of men, each with their own ideologies and attitudes towards life and Tombstone does suffice, it's just a little drawn-out; limp and mysteriously uninvolving for most of the time.

Holliday's relationship with Earp is certainly more low key in this one, something that fast-tracks character relations between the two and forces the film to focus on the cowboy gang as a primary source of antagonism, something that doesn't crop up nearly as much as Earp and Holliday's banter in Ford's version; hence the reason Tombstone comes across as the plodding piece it is.Italian born Cosmatos has his lead reflect what might very well be his own view on the material, in the sense Russell's Earp has an opinion on all the death and what's going on around him but it's a vacant feeling. A character's attempt at raising theological discussion with Russell's Earp near the beginning of the film is somewhat dismissed; amidst all the killing and hurt, it's established he doesn't care much about it &#x96; it's more so how Earp 'does' it rather than how he 'feels' about it, something that echoes the director's approach to the subject matter, in the sense he is more interested in black and white heroes and villains than looking at what these people think about those around them and particular predicaments. Holliday's easy truce with Earp is representational of this.Earp doesn't initially want the responsibility of keeping law and order. His smart and well dressed brothers stand in articulate contrast to Boothe's ragtag bunch of sloppy, roughly dressed and ugly looking bandits; although the film implores, in a bizarre manner, that practically everybody in the town is bound by a theatrical performance of a Shakespere piece; and that when the poetic nature of something so beautiful begins, everybody keeps quiet and observes. The film is one in which the focus is on men, and their relationship with one another and how they come to exist within the enclosed space of the town of Tombstone; a place that two different factions see two different, distinct futures in which they are at the respective centrefold of it all. In a film about men, men co-existing; men sorting out their relations with one another, it ought to be no surprise that the female characters are pushed to the back row - relegated to staying at home; staying silent and being seen out and about beside their man.Regardless, Tombstone isn't a bad film but it's certainly a lot less interesting than films that have taken on the story of Earp in the past. As an actioner, it works relatively well but as a character piece, it limps along for over two hours purely so that it can boil down to a showdown between good and evil. The melodramatic thunderclaps complete with lightning in the background as a key character dies about half way through exemplifies this, in the sense Cosmatos needs aid within the dramatic thunderclap sound effects to bring about more emotion out of the occurrence, rather than rely on all the previous character driven content for it to genuinely play out effectively. I like a good film about a power struggle in one locale between two groups of men, each with their own ideologies and attitudes towards life and Tombstone does suffice, it's just a little drawn-out; limp and mysteriously uninvolving for most of the time.

When I heard of the movie Lifeboat I thought, maybe some kind of Gilligan Island type movie, but more on the dramatic side. I guess I was wrong.Of course this doesn't stop the movie from being a well done Alfred Hitchcock movie. Again to my surprise this was done by Hitchcock. I hardly saw any Hitchcock movies, and did not know a lot about his films. But now after watching some of his films including Lifeboat, I have come to love his work.Lifeboat is a full on dramatic film. To think about it, this was probably a low budget film since it only takes place in one place, the middle of the sea. The camera footage was nice, angling on important characters and even in the beginning Hitchcock used his camera angle of looking through a characters eyes, something I have come to notice Hitchcock uses in his films.In a film like this, it gives you the chance to understand the characters even better, since it is confined in a small place. Learning their personal lives and their mental states. Also you get a better picture of all the drama that is going on. All the actors and actresses did a great job.Throughout the film it gets you wondering, what would you do to survive? I have to say Alfred Hitchcock yet again made an outstanding movie a very good classic to watch at least once.Not to give anything away...but I was kind of disappointed about the ending.

It's weirdness seems to overpower it, causing what I like to call The Art-house Effect. Many expect a mainstream film; this if far from one. Many viewers no doubt expected a film that would titillate and shock. It does do both of these things but they take a far backseat. For all it's convolution and confusion, the story is very simple. A man travels by night across Manhattan and Long Island at Christmas. During this all-nighter he has many strange adventures and is subjected to temptations. In the light of the next day, he is shown how wrong he was about his perceptions. If this reminds you of A Christmas Carol, then congratulations because you would be right. This film could be rightly called a very adult Carol. It also suggests legends and myths where the hero is tested by his encounters and found to be worthy.Kubrick was a film genius. He doesn't care if we don't get it, he never has. Most of his films have been received as being difficult to understand, yet later they somehow achieve clarity. It's as though we catch up to him after a few years. His lighting in this is especially sublime, pushing the exposure a few extra stops so that ambient light, (candles, table lamps, Christmas lights) is plenty of light. This makes the goings on dark and dreamlike. Further enhancing this unreal atmosphere are supposedly outdoor street scenes, which look artificial to the extreme. Look at the streets the next time you watch this, they look pristine, impossibly perfect. My only severe criticism of this film is the casting of Cruise and Kidman. A Superceleb couple at the time of filming, IMHO they are horribly miscast. Cruise projects very little presence, I wondered why anyone bothered to interact with him to the degree they do. Kidman pretty much started her Ice Queen period here, despite a playful character, she is distant. Their looks only go so far in this. There's the feeling of rebelliousness by both of them, as though they are fighting against the rest of the film. It's a testament to Kubrick's masterful hand that the film transcends this miscasting, under another director it might have ruined it. This film is magic. A fairy tale for grown ups. It's message is clear and echoed throughout the film by the password for entry to the party. Without trust and honesty in relationships, we are lost.
