[{"date":"12 August 2002","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":"  Disney has been putting forth a new genre.  It's called action.  Dinosaur is the first of this new genre that is made to appeal to young as well as old now.  First it gets rid of the crummy childish songs and stretches out on a dangerous limb by using James Newton Howard as the only composer.Basically, Disney has gotten it right for once.Dinosaur is an exceptional movie, with excellent family values and great action sequences as well.Let's start with the graphics.  Absolutely astounding!  The amount of effort in the characters' facial expressions is simply marvelous!  I was and am still impressed by the way these characters interact with their environment.  I don't care what anybody says--this is one of the most visually astounding movies ever.  The idea of filming certain areas and meshing it with the CGI was brilliant.Next, the characters.  They are the importance of the film.  Although they did not have enough development, I still believe we knew enough about them.  They have their great characteristics, speak the same throughout the movie, and the actors really did an excellent job.  Especially D. B. Sweeney as Aladar, who the second coolest character in Disney history (second only to Pegasus from Hercules).The plot is simple  island destroyed by meteorites, join with herd, find the nesting grounds.  Some say this is another Land Before Time, but I must completely disagree.  It does resemble it a bit, but Dinosaur is VERY original.  It follows its own story and plot, never really copying Land Before Time.The music is gorgeous.  Never have I heard such an amazing score, especially for a Disney movie.  James Newton Howard is one excellent composer--one of my favorites, thanks to this movie.Dinosaur is definitely not only for young ones.  There are death scenes, we see blood, and the action scenes involve terrifying Carnotaurs that could easily make you jump out of your seat.Dinosaur is obviously Disney's best.  I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys clean, good entertainment and doesn't mind having an imagination (since the animals talk).

You either admire Gilliam's energy or worry over a system that distorts such energy.I find this film a slightly interesting disaster. Only with `Fear and Loathing' has Gilliam found a successful way to present his hallucinatory world, because there it is explicitly hallucinagenic.I make a study of self-referential films, especially those that tell a story about telling a story and where the two stories merge. This is a special and important art form. I celebrate when it is done successfully and grieve when it is not. What's missing here is a coherent notion of how this alternative world works. It doesn't have to be logical or comfortable of course, but it has to readable enough that we have the skills to observe.Gilliam is sophisticated enough to have laid the groundwork for immense nesting of the dreams it is a play, a fiction by the authorities, an imagining by the man in the moon when he is not rutting, an arranged tactic by Venus to arouse the world for just such rutting, an opera by the Sultan, or -- the best -- the fantasy of young Sally who even here shows promise as an apprentice actor both in character and `reality.' Along the way, he juggles the forms is it Tarkovsky? Grimm? Kafka? Swift? Disney?

It requires a certain amount of willful suspension of disbelief otherwise you won't be able to enjoy the movie.  We all realize in real life1.  The students at Curtis Jr. High would have to wear uniforms (khaki\/blue pants or skirts with red, white or blue golf shirts) as required by most public school districts instead of the fashionable Gap, Nike, Yerf DOg and other brand name clothes they wear in this flick.  We also know that Jenna would have been sent home to change because her midriff and cleavage were exposed.2.  Bullies like Dobbs and McGinty don't operate in front of God and everybody with the sanction of the School Faculty and Administration.  In fact, both of them would have been expelled, sent to juvenile court and possibly a youth prison for their behavior.  Someone's dad or a Coach would probably have spotted McGinty beating up a kid, came over and either whipped his butt or sent him home to his parents.  Dobbs would have been racially profiled and possibly be in juvenile hall because of his extortive behavior.  3.  Principal Jinkaid would not have had the power to spend the school budget because most budgetary decisions are made at the school district level, with resources purchased centrally and installed by district personnel at the school.  There would have been multiple audits done by the district to ensure that all resources purchased by the budget were there and any discrepancies notated.  If Jinkaid had sold off the computers and so forth to build a stadium, he would have been caught in an audit, fired and sent to jail.  Also, he would have been sued by parents for his physical and psychological abuse of the students.  Most teachers and principals are so afraid of these kinds of lawsuits that the districts avoid corporal punishment and have no-touching rules for teachers\/faculty and students because of this fear.4.  Any 12 year old guy who looks like Max Keeble would take advantage of the opportunity to hook up with Jenna.  Point blank period.  They wouldn't have chosen Megan if Jenna showed interest.  Now, this being said, if they made this movie realistically, McGinty and Dobbs would have to operate off campus and out of sight, not grandstanding they way they do.  Oops, you lost the gag effect.  Jenna wouldn't be able to dress like Britney Spears on campus for the babe effect.  Ooops, lost another gag.    Everyone wearing uniforms would eliminate A LOT of product placement money in the movie budget, not to mention kill the notion of Phattitude.  Ooops!  Messed up again.The bottom line is that this movie is a piece of comic entertainment which parodies certain stereotypes, allows a bunch of kids to stick it to the bullies and the popular babes all in the name of standing up for the masses.  Kind of like Revenge of the Nerds for tweens.  The sight gags and physical comedy are very funny, and it is an enjoyable movie for the Family to watch.  Take it for what it is.  It's not meant to make some kind of statement or meant as some kind of tone poetry.  You can watch IFC for that.  Those kinds of movies have their place, but so does this one.  Lighthearted, family escapist entertainment.  It's good for what it is and that's all there is to it.
