[{"date":"22 October 2008","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Run Lola Run is an extremely fast-paced and stylized techno adventure that explores the nature of time, causality and freewill (Warning Today's generation of ADD folk will be highly stimulated!!!). The film is broken into three alternative stories, each with Lola running against the clock. Time seems to be Lola's enemy because she only has twenty minutes to deliver an unlikely sum of money to her boyfriend, Manni, before all hell breaks loose. Failure to complete this mission on time results in Manni's death. If she is successful, Manni will live. Therefore, Lola's objective is to conquer time and save her boyfriend. Each story, however, interprets time differently. Some interpretations view time as favorable and optimistic, while others are fatalistic and even dreadful. The major dramatic question thus becomes Will Lola make it on time? In the beginning of each story, Lola anxiously tries to figure out how she will manage to save the situation at hand. Her decision always ends the same Ask your wealthy father to bail you out. As soon as her mind becomes transfixed, she runs as fast as she can to his office to ask the favor. However, the outcomes are always different in regards to whether or not she will be successful. Along the way, Lola runs into several casual bystanders whom each time are shown to have different destinies as a result of running into Lola. For example, the woman who walks the baby has the most significant character arcs from winning the lottery, to dying in a hospital, to getting married. All of these outcomes are a result of whether or not she physically bumps into Lola along her path. When she does, her attitude becomes stubborn and hard, cursing Lola as she passes. Consequently, a flash of her entire life appears before the screen. I thought this was an interesting dynamic of how the people we run into on the map of time often trigger certain emotional responses within us. Time brings us together but also separates us depending on how we choose to react to life situations. Each story has its own what-if interpretation of how different things could be if people are roughly five seconds early or late to their appointed meetings. This five second difference, as the film shows, is the difference between succeeding and failing to obtain one's objectives. It is also the difference between whether chaos or harmony is created in people's lives. With this difference, the film seems to ask Why does time sometime work for people and other times not? Let me explain what I mean by this question. In the first story, Lola's late arrival causes Manni to rob a grocery market. Consequently, the cops come and end up shooting Lola in the crossfire. In the second story, Lola arrives on time but Manni crosses the street at the wrong time and is hit by a speeding ambulance. The crucial time difference in both stories seems to suggest the harshness of time; or as the old saying goes, They were at the wrong place at the wrong time. In the last story, however, Lola wins the lottery; Manni gets the money back from the bum and gives it to Ronni, leaving Lola and Manni with 100,000 marks. Time here seems to have worked for them. Lola changes for both good and bad in each story depending upon whether time works for or against her. In the first two stories, time works as her enemy, whereas in the last story it becomes her friend. I believe Tykwer was trying to show that time is both friendly and villainous depending upon how we're living our lives and how we react to life circumstances. The film overall does a really good job at creating intrigue within the viewer, as if to ask Could things ever have been different if given the chance to repeat the same day or experience over again? If so, how would you act differently?Throughout all three stories, the filmmakers ask a lot of curious questions about why things happen in life the way they do. Some of these questions include Are the things that happen to us in life predetermined, or are we the authors of our destinies? Can time be manipulated? What is the causal relationship between time and choice? These questions, along with many others, are for the viewer to think about in terms of their own life situation. The significance of Tykwer's film-making style is that it demonstrates the chaotic and hyperactive society that we all live in. With the increase in technology and industry, people become more and more spoiled to want things faster and faster. We truly are the impatient MTV generation that wants everything now. The fast-paced techno beats, the collage of video footage (animation\/35mm\/and digital video) and the rapid editing are all compliments to how life moves these days. Aside from Tykwer's homage to amalgamating all the latest types of technology into one, I believe the film's overall style was a metaphor for how we're all drowning in a sea of information but starving for its meaning. It was hard, at times, to keep up with all the visual stimuli because it was all being thrown at you so fast. Nevertheless, this film is perfect for anyone that often finds themselves impatient with the so-called slow-moving films.

","genre":"Crime, Drama"},{"date":"22 October 2008","score":"3 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" A beautiful, eloquent and thoughtful epic that is perhaps an anti-western. Gregory Peck is perfectly cast as the newly-arrived pacifist who is reluctantly cast into the battle between two powerful families in the Old West, one respected and one considered outcasts. William Wyler directs and probes plenty of questions as to justice, as Charles Bickford's family, for all their position and respect, treat the rough Hannassey clan (headed by bullish Burl Ives) no better than they treat them. In a terrific cast, Carroll Baker is Bickford's spoiled daughter who is engaged to Peck yet doesn't understand him. She's been bred to the ways of the Old West, and she can't understand the sort of man Peck is, and why he won't seem to fight. But her best friend and schoolmarm Jean Simmons (her lovely, down-to-earth quality makes her character very believable)does, and she and Peck fall in love. Charlton Heston smolders in the background as the Bickford's foreman who wants Carroll Baker badly (and these two seem to be made for each other). Aside from the convincing acting, and interesting plot, this is beautifully filmed and has a great musical score. Perhaps it lags in places, and even if it does run for 2 and a half hours some points aren't as fleshed out as I would have liked (I would have liked to have seen more of Heston's character, and Baker just disappears from the film at times). But it's still an excellent film, thoughtful and thought-provoking as the best movies should be.
