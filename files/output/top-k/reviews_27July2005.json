And specifically I remember the much talked about production of another film staring Bo Derek and Warren Beatty. And therein lies a small fish tale.I was working at a bookstore in a local mall prior to Splash's release. I was behind one of the cash registers when two men (one bald, or so I recalled, the other wearing a beret), standing above five feet, both wearing long black trench coats, and both speaking Italian (or possibly Greek), came into the store. They wanted books on mermaids, and said it was for Bo Derek's new film.Being a shopping mall bookstore, and a small one at that, we didn't have a whole lot on mermaids. But I remember pointing them to the small mythology section, and hearing some rustling and mumbling in Italian. They came back, reminded us that it was for Bo Derek's new film... to which we (myself and one other employee) shrugged, and guided them to another section (children's fiction, I think). Dismayed they complained to us that there was nothing there, to which we told them that we must not have anything, and that they might want to check the library.They left, and argued with one another out in front of the store. My coworker laughed, commenting They know Bo Derek? Ya right! I shrugged, and replied You never know. Reflecting back on that episode I know understand that these were either the art directors or conceptual artists for the other mermaid film that was to be the basis for the mermaid-film-market that summer. Only Ron Howard was able to get his project off and completed before my two Italian patrons could get the green-light for their film.I can't imagine what the other film would've been like. It probably would've been long, sappy, mildly amusing, and probably painted over with John Derek's supposedly erotic cinematography of his then wife.Whatever.I'm glad Splash came out, and was as funny as it was, and as big a hit as it was. Sometimes films don't need a market competitor, and deserve to monopolize the playing field. Not always, but sometimes they do. Splash could've fallen into the Mariana's trench of summer B-movies, but Howard and company had the right intuition to make the film smart, and not to put a nail in Davy Jones's locker by making Madison some mindless love interest.I can imagine Bo's movie would've had her roaming naked on the screen for about a third of the film, and probably would've packed the theatres with older teenage boys and frat-rats. I guess there's a place for that sort of thing. Even so I'm glad Splash was the film that made the charts instead of that other one.

The voice, the face, the actions all combine together to make her a perfect Tracy Flick.

I quite like her myself, but her role in 'The Good Girl' is a far cry from spoilt girl and Ralph Laurent employee Rachael Green in 'Friends'.In this dark comedy Aniston plays an everyday woman who's only enlightenment is working at the Retail Rodeo. She is unhappy in her marriage to Phil, or just bored. What first surprises you is that Phil isn't a bad guy and in some ways you can't understand why she is unhappy exactly, because apart from smoking weed and hanging out with loser 'Bubba', he treats Justine (Aniston) with love and respect. A mysterious young guy named Holden (Jake Gyllenhaal) catches her eye at work. He is an unhappy and troubled teenager which attracts Justine and she befriends him. This is the beginning of a troublesome few weeks for Justine. They start a steamy affair and Justine gets caught up in a lot of bother, to put it in a nice way. Justine is unfaithful to Phil, but deep down isn't a bad girl, hence the title of the film. The ending is somewhat tragic but also happy. This film is different and surprising. You go through many emotions watching the film. Its a great movie. Yes its not full of action but the story is so dark and there are a few funny moments. Personally Aniston has gone up in my estimation and her acting in this film is brilliant, possibly because it is so different to her other roles in films like Picture Perfect, Object of my Affection etc. Very good!

I quite like her myself, but her role in 'The Good Girl' is a far cry from spoilt girl and Ralph Laurent employee Rachael Green in 'Friends'.In this dark comedy Aniston plays an everyday woman who's only enlightenment is working at the Retail Rodeo. She is unhappy in her marriage to Phil, or just bored. What first surprises you is that Phil isn't a bad guy and in some ways you can't understand why she is unhappy exactly, because apart from smoking weed and hanging out with loser 'Bubba', he treats Justine (Aniston) with love and respect.

It has the same feel for time and place and what it's like to be a teenager in a slightly idealized, hyper-realist past but it's an altogether more kinetic work full of great visual flourishes.It centres on the three Maclean brothers, the deeply troubled, almost psychopathic Bobby who is a member of one of two rival gangs, (J S Duffy), Adam who is a talented artist hoping to go to Art School, (Joe McFadden) and the youngest Lex, who like Adam also has a talent for art but who also fosters some of Bobby's rebellious spirit (Iain Robertson). When Lex accidentally shoots a member of the rival gang in the eye, the boys find themselves caught up, in an almost surrealist fashion, in the conflict which turns very nasty indeed. MacKinnon may be dealing with such conventional issues as gang warfare but he treats the material in ways movies haven't done before. Adults, such as the boy's mother, (beautifully played by Clare Higgins), remain very much on the fringe.This is a violent, darkly funny but mostly tragic film and the performances from the mostly young cast are extraordinary, in particular from J S Duffy and Iain Robertson and from Garry Sweeney as the vicious leader of Bobby's gang. The film wasn't widely circulated or seen and consequently was not a commercial success yet it remains one of the key British films of the past 10 years.

It doesn't aspire to great movie-making. It was just supposed to be 90 minutes of entertainment on the big screen, and it's still entertaining. Take your brain off for a while and have fun with it. There are hilarious lines, some funny pratfalls and even a bit of home-grown wisdom How ignorant you are depends a lot on which part of the United States you're standing on. Or something like that. I get a kick out of watching the convoy\/rocking-chair scene every time. Makes me wonder how in the world they got around Birmingham, but that's suspension of disbelief for you. LOL. Wish director Hal Needham had remembered that Alabama State Troopers drive Fords, not Pontiacs, but that's a small thing. My dad remarked on it every time, though. It's just cornball entertainment, rare enough these days. Pop some popcorn and have a blast watching it.
