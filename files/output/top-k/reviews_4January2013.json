[{"date":"4 January 2013","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Waters after Hairspray is like Woody Allen after Stardust Memories - you have to admire his ideas, but as far as execution the magic is gone. Pecker sets-up like a stock plot holding together a Marx Brother's comedy. Stuffed shirts, in the form of New York art snobs, are punctured by hometown just folks. Unfortunately this isn't the Marx Brothers. Pecker's family and friends are neither fun nor interesting. And Water's undistinguished cast functions on a level well below the most routine Ma and Pa Kettle vehicle. The character acting is flat; Mary Kay Place, Mark Joy, Jean Schertler, Brendan Sexton, Carolyn Stayer, Jack Webster barely register on the screen. The supporting bit players are instantly forgettable. This is the fault of Pat Moran's casting judgement and Vince Peranio's flavorless set designs, neither of whom are helped by Water's lackluster jokes and apathetic timing. Any humdrum episode of Cheers is executed with more flair. Furlong, Lili Taylor, Martha Plimpton and Lauren Hulsey all appear ready and alert for a good show and are able to plow through soggy dialog while still showing signs of life. Unfortunately, none are given enough space to stage a filibuster and save the picture. Pecker is exactly the type of production that should have been vetted by a committee of Hollywood execs. They might have pitched better ideas about how to farm this turkey. The industry and audiences have caught up with the Waters program. They devour films and TV shows that make Mondo Trasho look respectable. That Waters would like to trade some of his cult status for box office success is understandable, but he is seriously misjudging the general audience who want something deeper and even more unique - not the same thing as on TV except more generic! Almost gave the Pecker an extra two stars for a fantastic Mink Stole cameo, but had to rescind them on account of a wasted Cindy Sherman appearance. John Waters is lucky the Baltimore Chamber of Commerce doesn't strip him of his citizenship after this pooped-out portrayal of his beloved hometown.

Furthermore, they can all give decent performances worthy of a better film.It's the underwater photography of a gill-man lurking in the Amazon waters while Miss Adams takes a brief swim that sticks in the mind after watching the film. The sheer suspense of seeing how selective he is in following her from the lower depths is given some striking underwater photography and subtle background music that captivates any viewer. When and how will this predator strike? It sets the stage for any suspenseful scenes that follow--and there are plenty of them.Fans of sci-fi thrillers get their money's worth with this one, crispy photographed in glorious B&W. And while the story lacks what we might call originality today, it's a good example of how its slight plot of man vs. underwater monster should be made.
