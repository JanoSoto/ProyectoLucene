I couldn't believe how this movie just came together.  The visual effects were outstanding, the costumes were brilliant, the cinematography was wonderful, and (yes believe it or not!!) excellent acting.In my opinion Kate Winslet made this movie and deserved her Oscar nomination for wonderful performance as Rose.  Kate Winslet is truly one of the actresses for the future she has already had two Oscar nominations and she is only 23!!  She was brilliant but it wasn't her absolute best (her best is Jude see it for all you Kate watchers she is wonderful in this movie).  If it wasn't for Kate Winslet this story probably wouldn't have worked!! Leonardo Dicaprio was wonderful and he should've had more award praise for his performance but it wasn't his best also (What's Eating Gilbert Grape and he was nominated for that!!).  Now Gloria Stuart was good but I thought Kathy Bates should've gotten in instead because her character stayed real!!All those people who sat such bad things about Titanic are crazy because what's not to love.  I know everybody is tired of the song My Heart Will Go On is a wonderful song and it fits the movie perfectly.  This is a gem of a movie and when Rose looke up and saw Jack up there while she was going down with everybody was so pivotal because she them jumped onto the deck and saw that her life whole would be everything she is with Jack not with an arranged marriage with a controlling jerk (played brilliantly by Billy Zane!!) remember when Molly Brown (Kathy Bates) asked him at the dinner table are gonna cut her meat for her!!This was such a materpiece and the only drawback was why did the older Rose just throw the gem into the sea it was puzzling but that still doesn't mean that this movie  gets a 10!!!

Because it was just sheer chance that I saw this.  I must say once it started it had me glued to the screen from start to finish.  Morgan Freeman and Christian Slater were compelling in their performances.  Randy Quaid as the sheriff of this small town gave an outstanding performance in this non stop action knockout thriller.  There is so much here I could say about this movie but to make this short I would just like to say I have no hesitation in recommending this to any one who likes their fast-paced action type of film laced with humor along the way, and may I just add that Betty White better known as Rose in the Golden Girls was just great in her performance.  To sum this up a good film for all.  Because the entire film was made in water due to the story line that the town was supposed to be flooded by intense rain,it made this film very unusual, thus explains the title Hard Rain.

It would be 10 but for the priests (and especially the Playing with the big boys now song) who were obvious Disney-style comic characters, and so out of place in this film.  Some of the animals were also too 'cartoony'.Other than that, it was fantastic to watch (deserves the cinematography Oscar, IMO) and beautifully animated.  Attention to detail was often incredible, I loved the fact that the parting of the Red Sea actually created a wind which could be seen blowing the characters' hair about.  The 'acting' was well above the usual standard for animated films, my favourite example being Rameses' I am the morning and the evening star. I am pharaoh speech between the nine plagues and the death of the first born.  In fact that whole sequence from turning the Nile to blood to Moses leaving the palace after Rameses has freed the Hebrews is amazing. I have read some reviews in the UK press which complain that the filmmakers were too cautious not to offend anyone and to avoid controversy. Without giving too much away, there are scenes in this sequence which really bring home the human cost of God's final plague on Egypt. The songs weren't as impressive individually as say, in a good Disney film, but the soundtrack as a whole worked really well.Having mentioned PoE's reviews, some comments (made here and elsewhere) have really annoyed me because they were so ill-informed.  One is the common complaint that God takes a cameo role.  I suggest that the reviewers read those parts of Exodus on which the film is more or less based.  Those who generally complain about the film inventing events and relationships not in the Bible, should realise that actually Prince of Egypt is a book in its own right (The Ten Commandments was also based on this book).  I haven't read this book, but if I was going to attack the film as an untrue adaptation in a professional review I think I would have checked the correct source text.
