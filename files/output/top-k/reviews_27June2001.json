It turned out that there were only four minutes left, but I didn't want to comment having not seen the end.. who knows, there actually could have been something interesting in those four minutes. I've just watched it again, on video, and I'd like to give my two centsThis is a film that pretentious people will say they loved, for the simple fact that it makes them feel smarter than the average viewer  You will notice that the majority of the positive reviews given here state that to fully understand this film, you need patience, open mindedness, (and) intelligence, and to be intelligent and sensitive. Apparently, if you don't enjoy this film, it is because you are not intelligent enough, and not because this is simply a poorly made film trying to pass itself off as intellectual.Watching this movie, it is as if someone decided to take the intensity and raw emotion of Saving Private Ryan, which this film is often compared to, and the creativity and beauty of poetry, and smash them together. There are ways that this could have worked, but they don't here. Rather, The Thin Red Line comes off as alienating, frustrating, and weak, albeit beautifully filmed.There is some vague concept of a plot, hung around a handful of tentpole characters who are either established actors confusing stupidity for humanity, or young men, straight from the latest issue of Details, who all look alike and spend an inordinate amount of time bathing under waterfalls.You would think that the amount of time spent on characterization would make the viewer feel something, anything for these characters, but despite what feels like hours of voice-over, nothing is ever really said about them, their lives, or their feelings. In my opinion, I would have had much more empathy with the characters if they had voiced their thoughts in coherent, normal ways. I don't know a single person who expresses themselves in the fashion depicted here... like a Calvin Klein advertisement, only less interesting. Don't take my word for it, look at the 'memorable quotes' section to the left... and remember that these lines were written for a major motion-picture, and not poetry night at the local coffeeshop.I'm not familiar with Mr. Mallick's work, but I would hope that, due to his reputation, this is an abberation caused by the sudden rush for 'war' films after the success of Private Ryan. I prefer to think that he is an intelligent director who respects his audience, but was carried away by studio's urging, along with the dozen actors all pulling for their own oscar-winning speech. If this is not correct, and The Thin Red Line is indeed the film Mr. Mallick wanted, I find it sad that a respected director would make a film so vapid, egotistical, and, despite it's pretentions, ultimately meaningless.

In short, take everyone you know to this movie - they won't be disappointed and will discover what anime REALLY is.I have recently seen Vampire Hunter D (2000) in Moscow as part of the International film festival, and the entire cinema had burst into applauds once the credits started. Mind you, the majority of viewers were not anime fans but ordinary people. Even some of the bada$$-looking security guards left their posts to take a peek, and stayed to the end.This movie has it all. Ultimately superior 24 frames\\sec animation and an astonishing music score combine to entangle the viewer in a hypnotic trance from title to credits. The beautifully choreographed action sequences take your breath away, as the characters brush within hair's distance from gruesome death... or sometimes a little too close.Yes, Vampire Hunter D certainly has a fair share of violence. Though here, agony is music and death is a masterpiece, but some of the little children might not appreciate that (or appreciate a little too much ;-)). As for everyone else... enjoy the vicious dance.The setting is a mix of cyberpunk (see Ghost in the Shell, Akira) and Middle Ages mystics (see Vampire Hunter, Demon City, perhaps Vampire princess Miyu), but the styles do not clash, rather producing an engaging synthesis, unique imagery and feeling.Perhaps the weakest point is the plot - and that's only because it is good, while everything else is excellent. Personally I found it a tiny bit disappointing that an anime produced otherwise as a peak of artistry didn't rise too high above cliches. On the other hand, though it might not be as much a feast for the brain as the likes of Neon Genesis Evangelion or Serial Experiments Lain, it has certainly avoided confusing the viewers (a la Akira) while still maintaining a good storyline.The plot even manages to be unpredictable at times.(The following might be considered a SPOILER).The main figures of shaded fate are Meier Link, a powerful vampire and the most notable antagonist, and his human beloved (her name eludes me for the moment). Personally, I didn't know whether they'll survive until the very end. (END SPOILER).The ending seemed a bit rushed, though.

Her curse is that she has always been susceptible to motion sickness, a condition which at the most inopportune times has had a significantly debilitating effect on her.  As with her cooking, however, Isabella learned early on how to master the situation.  To overcome it, she learned, she simply has to be the one in control-- in a car, she has to drive; on the dance floor, she has to lead; she takes the stairs instead of the elevator; and even while making love, she has to take charge.  And, as is often the case with one who aggressively works to overcome a difficulty, it's made her strong.  Without even thinking about it, Isabella has learned not only how to transcend her problem, but how to control her own life, as well, which is good-- up to a point.  But as she one day discovers, it can also lead to certain complications; complications that have to do with matters of the heart.  With love.\tOne day, at a restaurant near the beach in Bahia, Isabella meets a young man, Toninho (Murilo Benicio), who happens to own the restaurant.  When he sees Isabella, it's love at first sight.  He is swept away by her beauty, and when he discovers what she can do in the kitchen! well-- he simply does not rest until she consents to be his wife.  And it's a marriage made in heaven.  Almost.  They love each other passionately, and with Isabella in the kitchen, the restaurant begins to thrive.  But while Toninho is out in front with the customers taking bows, Isabella is hidden away doing the cooking.  Which is fine with her; they have each other, and they are doing what they love.  Still, there is the matter of Isabella having to be the `one on top' all the time, and even though Toninho understands why, it begins to subtly eat away at his ego.  After all, a man must be a man, no matter what-- and when finally, though he loves Isabella deeply, he feels he must give into his `urge' and do something to reaffirm his masculinity, problems begin to arise.  And that's when Isabella discovers how mixed the blessings of her life are, and realizes that she, too, has some reaffirming to do.

Her curse is that she has always been susceptible to motion sickness, a condition which at the most inopportune times has had a significantly debilitating effect on her.  As with her cooking, however, Isabella learned early on how to master the situation.

In her latest offering from Touchstone Pictures, Crazy Beautiful, she turns in quite a grown up performance. It's the old crazy mom equals crazy daughter fable. (Bette Davis didn't do too badly with this in Now Voyager.) Here KD is pure delinquent, an un-stoppable cyclone of self-destruction. Very Teen oriented here so the visuals are soft-pedaled and there is no on screen shooting, smoking, sipping or snorting. This is not a `how to' film about drugs and drinking it's a `this is what happens when' picture.It's a little misleading at first. The one sheet and the trailer set us up with a Romeo and Juliet, Malibu-East LA, rich white girl\/poor Latino boy thing. And it's all that too. Her co-star is young Jay Hernandez in his second feature. He is Carlos. Everyday he takes a two-hour bus ride from one end of the economic scale to the other. He is all grace and dignity. The kid is just gorgeous. And against type, he and his Boyle Heights family are presented with the strength of character that is typical in life and rare in the media.They meet on the beach. They go to the same high school. She gets him in trouble. He thinks she's a kook. Their friends disapprove. She's in the photo class. They make out in the dark room. Their parents disapprove. They go back to the beach.The well meaning, liberal Congressman dad who doesn't understand his wild child is veteran Bruce Davison. He is perfect in the role. The film is as much about her relationship with her dad as it is about the boyfriend. And the very sentimental, sugar sweet ending may be considered saccharine by some and wonderful by others because, guess what, love conquers all.Stand out performances by Taryn Manning as Kirsten's best friend-second self with matching haircuts and outfits. And Lucinda Jenny is nothing less than Oscar bait in a mere four scenes she is Mrs. Bruce Davison, the most despicable trophy-wife, step-mom, control-freak ever filmed. If she wasn't so brilliant at being awful she go home with a statuette. The ultra-now compilation soundtrack has some real thought and soul going though it. Not bad.Lastly, I would like to personally thank the producers, writers, director and cast for showing two young people about the have sex stop for a condom. Yay.

The film begins at a qick pace and just picks up speed along the way culminating in a wonderful and exciting (if not slightly predictable)climax.

Even if you're not a fan of this movie, watch it just once more to see how well these two play off of each other. This film is a true masterpiece and is in my mind a modern classic, far superior to Sixth Sense in every way, and a much more emotionally powerful film as well.

For 15 years, the movie remained a seemingly mythical promise -- Kubrick's long awaited return to science fiction. For ages, the movie remained in pre-production as Kubrick waited for special effects technology to advance to the point where his vision could be achieved. Alas, just as that time arrived, Kubrick left this mortal coil. And so it is left to Steven Spielberg -- who collaborated with Kubrick during the movie's long development process -- to examine the concept that so fascinated his mentor. At its core, A.I. looks at what will happen when the human race acquires the ability to create a machine that will love. What will happen when love can be literally packaged, put in a box and sold? What responsibility will humans have for machines that love them?The machine, in this case, is David, a prototype robot boy played wonderfully by Haley Joel Osment (The Sixth Sense) made-up to make his skin look slightly rubbery. David is the perfect child. He goes to bed whenever you tell him. He smiles, he's helpful, polite, and he will never grow up. And he loves unconditionally.He is given to a set of parents in need, but like any toy, David quickly becomes expendable. Soon, he's cast out into the futuristic wilderness and must set out on a quest to regain his mother's love. Sadly misguided by the fairy tale Pinocchio, David believes the only way he can win his mother back is by finding someone who can turn him into a real little boy.Here, the sensibilities of Kubrick and Spielberg both merge and diverge. Kubrick -- the cynic -- would have had fun with the absurdity of a machine that will stop at nothing trying to carry out its program, even if it means trying to achieve something that's unachievable. Spielberg, meanwhile -- the more sentimental artist -- approaches David's quest as being emblematic of one of the most basic and universal human desires... David just wants his Mommy! We all identify with that basic need and Spielberg taps into that to pull our heart strings.The styles of Kubrick and Spielberg are seen in different ways. The lighting and the shooting style is mostly Spielberg, with a few Kubrick homages. Kubrick was known for a cold style and probably would have foregone the many warm tones used here. Much of the art direction and music is reminiscent of 2001 A Space Odyssey and A Clockwork Orange (there's even a Milk Bar sign visible at one point). But the movie probably owes just as much to Blade Runner, particularly in David's journey through the harsh urban future world. One setting, Rouge City, looks like a sexed-up Las Vegas on crack.It is in these harsh outer realms that David meets up with other mechas, namely a sex robot named Gigolo Joe, played by Jude Law. Spielberg plays the sex machine concept for laughs, but in a PG-13 way. One can only imagine where Kubrick would have gone with the idea. David also sees the harsh treatment most mechas receive from resentful orgas. In one extended sequence, David is swept-up into a flesh fair -- a bizarre spectacle in which robots are destroyed in violent ways for the amusement of humans.The visual effects involving the mangled robots are well done, but we've seen this CGI craftsmanship so often now, audiences will almost take it for granted. The most enjoyable visual effect turns out to be David's robotic supertoy sidekick, Teddy. Spielberg manages to make the character utterly adorable without causing you to gag. Think Snuggle the fabric softener bear with the voice of a truck driver.The worst sight is a cartoon character voiced by Robin Williams that feels completely out of place. By the way, also listen for voice cameos by Chris Rock, Ben Kingsley and Amy Irving.A.I.'s only other weakness is its pacing. The movie is only about two hours and 15 minutes, but it feels a lot longer. Many will also find the ending too drawn out. The film could easily end about a half-hour before it does; instead we're treated to a 2001-ish through-the-stargate style denouement. Some will lose patience with this part of the film, but its addition allows the introduction of another BIG SCIENCE FICTION IDEA -- one that I won't reveal here.In the end, A.I. is not everything fans have hoped for all these years, but it's darn close. And it's simply nice to see the film finally unspooling on a theater screen. We haven't had a serious science fiction film this good in quite a while. A.I. is a film that ponders deep ethical questions about technology and the future of the human race and challenges us to examine the true meaning of love.

","genre":"Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"27 June 2001","score":"","review":"  This, at long last, is the world of Stanley Kubrick's A.I. For 15 years, the movie remained a seemingly mythical promise -- Kubrick's long awaited return to science fiction. For ages, the movie remained in pre-production as Kubrick waited for special effects technology to advance to the point where his vision could be achieved. Alas, just as that time arrived, Kubrick left this mortal coil. And so it is left to Steven Spielberg -- who collaborated with Kubrick during the movie's long development process -- to examine the concept that so fascinated his mentor. At its core, A.I. looks at what will happen when the human race acquires the ability to create a machine that will love. What will happen when love can be literally packaged, put in a box and sold? What responsibility will humans have for machines that love them?The machine, in this case, is David, a prototype robot boy played wonderfully by Haley Joel Osment (The Sixth Sense) made-up to make his skin look slightly rubbery. David is the perfect child. He goes to bed whenever you tell him. He smiles, he's helpful, polite, and he will never grow up. And he loves unconditionally.He is given to a set of parents in need, but like any toy, David quickly becomes expendable. Soon, he's cast out into the futuristic wilderness and must set out on a quest to regain his mother's love. Sadly misguided by the fairy tale Pinocchio, David believes the only way he can win his mother back is by finding someone who can turn him into a real little boy.Here, the sensibilities of Kubrick and Spielberg both merge and diverge. Kubrick -- the cynic -- would have had fun with the absurdity of a machine that will stop at nothing trying to carry out its program, even if it means trying to achieve something that's unachievable. Spielberg, meanwhile -- the more sentimental artist -- approaches David's quest as being emblematic of one of the most basic and universal human desires... David just wants his Mommy! We all identify with that basic need and Spielberg taps into that to pull our heart strings.The styles of Kubrick and Spielberg are seen in different ways. The lighting and the shooting style is mostly Spielberg, with a few Kubrick homages. Kubrick was known for a cold style and probably would have foregone the many warm tones used here. Much of the art direction and music is reminiscent of 2001 A Space Odyssey and A Clockwork Orange (there's even a Milk Bar sign visible at one point). But the movie probably owes just as much to Blade Runner, particularly in David's journey through the harsh urban future world. One setting, Rouge City, looks like a sexed-up Las Vegas on crack.It is in these harsh outer realms that David meets up with other mechas, namely a sex robot named Gigolo Joe, played by Jude Law. Spielberg plays the sex machine concept for laughs, but in a PG-13 way. One can only imagine where Kubrick would have gone with the idea. David also sees the harsh treatment most mechas receive from resentful orgas. In one extended sequence, David is swept-up into a flesh fair -- a bizarre spectacle in which robots are destroyed in violent ways for the amusement of humans.The visual effects involving the mangled robots are well done, but we've seen this CGI craftsmanship so often now, audiences will almost take it for granted. The most enjoyable visual effect turns out to be David's robotic supertoy sidekick, Teddy. Spielberg manages to make the character utterly adorable without causing you to gag. Think Snuggle the fabric softener bear with the voice of a truck driver.The worst sight is a cartoon character voiced by Robin Williams that feels completely out of place. By the way, also listen for voice cameos by Chris Rock, Ben Kingsley and Amy Irving.A.I.'s only other weakness is its pacing. The movie is only about two hours and 15 minutes, but it feels a lot longer. Many will also find the ending too drawn out. The film could easily end about a half-hour before it does; instead we're treated to a 2001-ish through-the-stargate style denouement. Some will lose patience with this part of the film, but its addition allows the introduction of another BIG SCIENCE FICTION IDEA -- one that I won't reveal here.In the end, A.I. is not everything fans have hoped for all these years, but it's darn close.

He also tells her he's spent his entire life in mental hospitals, but she apparently takes little note of this fact.  However, she tells him she will never love him and that he is wasting his time.

After they have sex, she tells him, Ah, yes.  NOW I remember you.  Remember, boys, THAT'S the way to get a woman to remember you.  After all, a woman NEVER forgets a good f**king.  After the woman is rescued and finds herself safe among family and friends, what does she do?  Call the police?  Press charges?  Start her way through a painful emotional process?  NO!

People mention S&M in regard to this movie.  Irrelevant -- people who practice S&M do so based on trust and loving relationships; kidnapping is based on fear, mistrust, and violent force.

First, Jonathan Demme wasn't returning to direct; that's it!  It couldn't possibly be good, right?  Oh, but Ridley Scott is going to do it...DAMN!  Well, Ted Tally isn't going to adapt the book; that must be it.  Alright, they got David Mamet...DOUBLE DAMN!  Now while Anthony Hopkins is coming back to play Lecter, Jodie Foster isn't going to play Clarice; that's the end all-be all of reasons why this movie shouldn't be made, right?  Especially considering the list of replacements they were talking about.  I read about Sarah Michelle Gellar and Gillian Anderson.  Two actresses that I like, but certainly couldn't play Clarice Starling.  Then, out of nowhere, they dropped the bomb on me.  Julianne Moore... unbelievably foul expletive deleted.So going in I had some really high expectations for Julianne Moore.  And all I can say is that she surpassed them all beautifully.  Jodie Foster was great, but given that she was not going to play Starling again, we move on.  And there is absolutely no one who could have done any better than the incredible Julianne Moore.

I've lived in either Florida or North Carolina my whole life, and the subject of Jews has never really come up, so I can't personally relate to this specific subject.  Yet, in the South, we deal with racial prejudice, as well as healing prejudice against the Hispanic population here.  As John Garfield's character explains, it's not about the Jews.  It's about the equality and freedom that this country and Constitution is supposed to stand for.  In this film, Peck learns what it's like to be a Jew during this time period, and from an audience standpoint (if you're not Jewish, you will too.)One complaint  Too much of that love story (Of course, that fits a lot of films.)The performances in this movie are all great.  Probably the most underrated is John Garfield at his best.  Not a 10, but close.. and a must-see for everyone at least once. ","genre":"Drama, Romance"}]
