Saying that the topics that are addressed have no impact on society anymore, clearly misses the point. ... The 50s -- or more specifically, 50s TV -- is used as a metaphor, because of the way 50s TV portrayed life in America. ... Thematically, this movie is about Living Life to the fullest, whatever that means. More specifically, to live life to the fullest -- to truly feel alive -- you need to take the good with the bad. Sweeping things under the rug and just acting pleasant all the time, is no way to live. That's what Tobey McGuire's speech at the end to his real mother is all about. Bad things happen, it's part of life. Having passion brings with it positives and negatives -- but suppressing true feelings for the sake of pleasantness is an empty life. THAT is the key ... and that issue is everlasting to the human condition. Another point People fear change. This is universal from the start of time until the end of time. The film suggests that changing and growing as a society and as people -- even if scary -- is good. Just because the 50s were used as a metaphor for that, don't believe for a minute this isn't a universal issue that exists today and forever.Another issue common for people critical of this film is the sexual issue.  They say that Gary Ross is promoting sexual promiscuity, sex out of wedlock, etc...  Again, I believe it misses the point.  Is Ross suggesting that premarital sex is OK?  Yes, and I'd agree - and I'm sure there's plenty of people who don't agree with that, and that's OK too.  But, again, the sex is just part of the theme - used as a high-profile example to making the overall point about openness - and not suppressing one's feelings.  Note that the Reese Witherspoon character was already promiscuous, and her transformation was actually something completely different.I can't make everyone like this film - I'll just say that, on a personal note, I was so floored by this film, I had to see it again the next day. That had never happened to me before, or since. Ross' commentary goes on to speak of everything I felt about the film when I first saw it. It was great to hear that his reasons for what he did, meshed exactly with how I took it. I had to write him a letter to tell him so - another thing I'd never done before or since.This is not a perfect film. I liked its subtlety, but then the racism correlation, and the censorship stuff, got a bit more overt. The courtroom scene at the end is a bit cliche ... and I also agree with one poster who said that, to make the point about taking the good with the bad, we should've seen a bit more about the consequences of their actions.Those are merely nitpicks in the grand scheme of things.

First, I agree with the last reviewer that there is perhaps a bit too much sex in the film.  If they would strike about three scenes, this would be a movie that (like The Princess Bride) I could recommend to absolutely anyone, even my mother or my pastor, with total confidence.  Only one of the sex-related scenes really adds humor and advances the story (a couple make love in a public restroom, causing things to bounce around outside, a replay of a scene from the equally marvelous Delicatessen, by the same director).Secondly, the film really does rely too much on voice-over narration.  Sometimes what the narrator is saying is obvious, sometimes it's just a quick way to move us on to the next scene.  Sometimes, admittedly, it works very well.  But in a film that does such a wonderful job of telling the story in a creative way (using talking photographs and a gesturing statue, for example), it seems to me that more could have been done to spare us the voice-over in may places.  If I had wanted a book on tape I would've rented one!Now that said, this really is a marvelous gem of a film.  The quirky humor is at times laugh-out-loud funny, and the story keeps one guessing.  Unlike the last reviewer, I was not bothered by the dangling story lines; it seemed to me that these were just vignettes designed to draw me in to the world of Amelie.  It would have been very Hollywood to tie them all up in a neat package in the last ten minutes of the film.Visually, too, the film is stunning.  Everything one sees is carefully placed to be evocative and stylized.  Most of the colors are washed-out, so that every once in a while a bright object will catch the eye at a strategic moment.All of the minor characters are fun, well-scripted and used to good effect in advancing the story.  But the character of Amelie really makes or breaks the film.  If, like me and most others, you find her to be charming, beautiful, and sweet, you'll probably love the film.  If she reminds you of someone who used to make fun of you in high school, it'll be a long two hours.9\/10If you like Amelie, I would certainly recommend that you check out Delicatessen.

Joseph Cotton was the only achieved star at the time of this film's release and his portrayal of the wildly unpredictable George Loomis is enough to send chills up the spine of unsuspecting film buffs everywhere.  But still, it is Marilyn Monroe who is this film's anchor.  Her mysterious spell is cast from the first frame she appears in to the last.  The scene where she sings Kiss while wearing that tight red dress is probably my all time favorite moment out of all her films (along with the diamonds are a girls best friend number from Gentlemen Prefer Blondes and runnin' wild from Some Like It Hot).This film is a worthy addition to the by-then fading film noir genre, even though it is shot in bright, vivid Technicolor (I assume).

Desperately in need of Dalton's harder realism, this self-parodying Bond format looks tired, dated and repetitive. Written so relentlessly by the numbers, it's an identikit of any other Bond movie, with only the schoolboyish puns altered.Right from the opening, the extended skiing sequence has a `seen it all before' feel, while the Beach Boys number is just plain silly. The neon titles, probably the height of fashion in the mid-80s, haven't aged well to say the least. Some of the stunts must have taken great time and money to achieve, yet they're so formulaic that you don't even notice them. Others are just plain nonsensical, such as the Lloydesque fire ladder routine that eats up over five minutes of screentime. And the exotic locales, such as the Eiffel Tower, are made virtually obsolete by John Glen's indifferent direction.Many of the guest cast misfire Patrick MacNee is a leading man, not comedy support, while Fiona Fullerton's plank-like diction renders innuendoes like `I love an early morning ride' redundant. Crucially though, the masterful Christopher Walken just doesn't work in this childish nonsense. He's as good as always, though maybe that's the problem &#150; he's too good for the material.A roll call of racial stereotypes pass the screen, building up a flimsy plot of horses, earthquakes and microchip technology. The plot illogic here isn't really worth bothering with &#150; this is a James Bond movie after all &#150; though what stable owner, even a psychotic one, would go to the trouble to build steeplechase booby traps? The use of mild bad language and even dumber than usual humour also makes this a particularly U.S-aimed Bond. Though as Stallone and Schwarzenegger were flavour of the month then what would Americans want with an old granny who's practically ginger?It's cruel to remark on the star's age, yet in a bedroom scene with Grace Jones, we see a hard, toned, muscular body slide under the sheets&#133; and yes, it's Grace's. Even after six movies Roger is still the least convincing Bond for fights, while one of the villains is Big Ron from Eastenders. When Zorin's computer lists Roger as `extremely dangerous' you can't believe it's talking about the same man. His stunt double, maybe. Incidentally, check out the rubbish continuity that sees May Day's sunglasses transmigrate from her face to her hand when she ejects the businessman from the airship. Cheesiest line award has to go to the corny crowbarring in of the nonsensical title with `what a view' `to a kill'.For Moore's final outing then this is a curiously nondescript entry and lacks the kind of climatic spectacle that characterised Licence to Kill or You Only Live Twice. And in a film that has probably the worst screen backdrops of the last fifty years then it's only fitting that the (admittedly fairly exciting) finale sees him crudely dubbed onto Golden Gate Bridge. Sadly, though perhaps aptly, Roger's last line spoken as 007 is a Carry On style `ooooh'.Possibly the weakest of all official Bonds, A View To A Kill is certainly the weakest Moore vehicle. I couldn't help wondering if a person who'd never seen a Bond movie before would be drawn to the series if this was their first experience of it. In all honesty, I think the answer is no. 4\/10.

Desperately in need of Dalton's harder realism, this self-parodying Bond format looks tired, dated and repetitive. Written so relentlessly by the numbers, it's an identikit of any other Bond movie, with only the schoolboyish puns altered.Right from the opening, the extended skiing sequence has a `seen it all before' feel, while the Beach Boys number is just plain silly. The neon titles, probably the height of fashion in the mid-80s, haven't aged well to say the least. Some of the stunts must have taken great time and money to achieve, yet they're so formulaic that you don't even notice them. Others are just plain nonsensical, such as the Lloydesque fire ladder routine that eats up over five minutes of screentime. And the exotic locales, such as the Eiffel Tower, are made virtually obsolete by John Glen's indifferent direction.Many of the guest cast misfire Patrick MacNee is a leading man, not comedy support, while Fiona Fullerton's plank-like diction renders innuendoes like `I love an early morning ride' redundant. Crucially though, the masterful Christopher Walken just doesn't work in this childish nonsense.

TCM showed this on a Valentine's weekend, with a number of other classic romantic films from the great It happened one night onwards, but I found this one to be more a combination of Time Machine, Portrait of Jenny and Dorian Gray all rolled into one. There are a couple of things to recommend it, the first being the rich saturated color and quite attractive photography -- the art director alludes to a number of impressionist and early modern paintings in the shots that one can recognize in scenes. A second would be the setting of the Grand Hotel at Mackinac as the real star of the movie. A third would be Teresa Wright, who only has a bit part, but is the only one with genuine emotion and acting experience who brought more to it than anyone else in the cast.So why didn't I like it? *Spoilers ahead* First of all, the script is flat as a pancake. Never mind the clever story, how about some real dialogue? I'll skip the scenes in Chicago, and cut to the Grand Hotel after finally making it back in time, Reeve goes walking and at last glimpses the woman he has been desperately seeking, a vision incarnate, but after staring at her, what does he say? Did I startle you? Who wouldn't be startled with peepers like his? Then they start talking to each other, but instead of real speech, we get more piped-in Rachmaninoff, or violins soaring by Roger Williams they have nothing to say to each other through the whole film! what little they do say is in reaction to the negative presence of Christopher Plummer, as the Svengali-like figure of the producer. His is a thankless role, and a waste of a great voice. One forgets that with a great director like John Huston, he appeared in The Man who would be King, transcending The Sound of Music by far.Secondly, Reeve bears an unfortunate resemblance to Hurd Hatfield, that totally forgettable actor of the 1945 classic Portrait of Dorian Gray, except that Hatfield made the movie unforgettable with his masklike face and beady eyes. Enter Christopher Reeve again, from the youthful playwright in the opening, to the petrified face in the final scene, that surely is Dorian Gray redux. (So who wouldn't be startled?) Jane Seymour is actually quite lovely in the film, but, like Plummer, has nothing to work with, and her absence of inner emotion actually works in her favor as a vision from the past. Her only real scene is the one she acts out onstage, and which sets the completely wrong tone by having the audience guffaw at her maid when the scene opens.Can we look to anyone but the director for this failure of dramatic guidance? Glancing at his credits, I find that they are vitually all TV serials of some kind, and except for Ally McBeal, don't seem to have hit paydirt. By comparison, a movie like Notting Hill, which is also considered a Valentine's feature and played during the same weekend, while not everyone's favorite, has genuine dialogue (marvelously delivered by Hugh Grant and company, as only the English can deliver offhand speech), is an exuberant commentary on courtship and supportive friends, and even has its own Dorian Gray in the face of Julia Roberts, who seems like a creature from Mars who's emerged from her own personal Helix.For Somewhere in Time, half* of five *****; if the film's become a cult, it must be its surreal and not so nice nature.
