[{"date":"11 November 2007","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" URBANIA held my interest primarily because of the performance by DAN FUTTERMAN as the troubled gay man experiencing pain and heartbreak over a bad week-end in metropolis. He wanders around, seemingly in a daze most of the time, but eventually we understand that this is going to turn into a revenge story where he seeks out the man who humiliated him and his gay lover.Unfortunately, Futterman's character remains ambiguous throughout. At one moment, he's sympathetic and helps a beggar on the street--and the next moment he's completely heartless in the way he treats a street pick-up gone wrong or a young couple he attaches himself to for the mere sport of abusing them with the truth about their being his upstairs neighbors who are not discreet in their lovemaking.He's such a complex person, but the script doesn't explain why he behaves as he does. At least the unpredictablility of the story is not a drawback--in fact, it helps sustain interest since the viewer doesn't have a clue as to what will happen next. It's a nice build-up of suspense that keeps the drama edgy until the final shot.All the performances are beyond reproach, so it's not the actors who are to blame for whatever shortcomings the story has. But some scenes are awkwardly staged, others deeply impressive--so it's an uneven mix of good and bad moments and sometimes guilty of style over substance.It won awards from some of the gay film societies but seems to have made not much of an impression at all on mainstream moviegoers with its homoerotic content, despite the fact that one of its characters mouths off some homophobic comments and gets his comeuppance in the end in what is basically a tale of revenge, gay style.
