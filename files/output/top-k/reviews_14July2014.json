[{"date":"14 July 2014","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Drugs have been a major issue all around the world, and in Traffic we see three different stories revolving around drugs and how each character is affected. The first story is about a Mexican police office named Javier (Benicio Del Toro) who gets enthralled with taking down a Mexican drug hit-man for a huge cartel. Javier soon finds out about the corruption and danger he gets caught up in, and his life gets full of energy. Next we have Michael Douglass playing a conservative judge in Ohio who is head of the President's Office of National Drug Control Policy but just so happens to have a daughter hooked on drugs. Then there's the most intense story, where in San Diego two DEA agents played by Don Cheadle and Luiz Guzman try and take down a drug dealer and get caught up with even more crime. As they take down their first target, the man gives up the name of his boss causing that man's wife Helena (Catherine Zeta-Jones) to get involved as well. The three stories emerge together and cause great intensity and experience to the audience about the different types of law enforcement on drugs and how many use drugs as well. The comparison between the law enforcers like Benicio Del Toro, Michael Douglass, and Don Cheadles characters and how kids like Michael Douglass's daughter played by Erika Christensen get hooked on drugs due to the failures and corruption of law enforcement, and due to the tremendous amount of growth the drug industry as seen. Steven Soderbergh directs this film beautifully, using great intensity, complex shots to show the chemistry of each scene and show how each character transforms due to their experience with drugs. Traffic is just visually so complex with every film technique. The acting ensemble is very rich, and every character especially Benicio Del Torro gives a powerhouse performance that are historical. This intelligent story is a film that shows different aspects of drugs and how there is a future for stopping this issue, but to raise its awareness, a monumental film is necessary. Traffic is one the greatest films of all time!

It is well-written, masterfully shot and fantastically acted. It is indeed a very, very good film. Yet it falls short of greatness for two reasons.The cinematography in «Boogie Nights» is great. It is easy to imagine the filmmakers sitting around before every shot, every scene, trying to come up with the best, most original way to shoot it. This is the opposite of lazy filmmaking and that's fantastic. It is, however, very much 'in your face filmmaking'. Unlike Kubrick, who faced similar but completely unfounded accusations, people criticizing PTA for being pretentious may actually have a point, as much as I hate to admit it. There are definitely shots that are there just because they look nice, and the first long, gorgeous and complicated oner is a perfect example. It is a masterful shot that introduces all the major characters, the setting, establishes tone and also references «Goodfellas». Yet there is a reason why Ray Liotta entering Copacabana through the back entrance is one of the best long takes in history. It serves a purpose, has a thematic meaning (the seamless descent into the criminal world, the smooth lifestyle that it seems to promise, its ultimate futility as symbolized by identical water cranes, Scorcese and his cinematographer showing off along with Henry Hill, and on and on). In «Boogie Nights» the long take is there for the sake of the long take. While later on, the oner in which William H. Macy shoots his wife and himself brilliantly creates tension, it is more of an exception than the rule, as most of the time artistic photography prevails over story. No matter how compelling both are, this is not an attractive quality in a film.The second reason has to do with Mr. Scorcese himself. Yes, Martin Scorcese is one of the greatest filmmakers in history and yes, he has influenced most of the people standing behind a camera today, and few more so than Paul Thomas Anderson. Yet the influence of «Goodfellas» is sometimes too apparent. There are moments when Anderson, rather than offering an homage, ventures dangerously close to copycat territory. «Boogie Nights» is a fiercely original story; however its originality is lost as it parallels «Goodfellas» closer and closer as it progresses. Thematically (the ideas of delusion, family, corruption through money and power, etc.), visually and through its use of music, «Boogie Nights» rarely does something Scorcese has not done 7 years before. Throw in the influence of Quentin Tarantino, and Anderson's originality becomes quite questionable.And yet, despite all this, and a few structural problems (pacing is off, the 2,5 h film could have benefited from a more rigorous edit, character motivation sometimes unclear, the loop-we-are- back-to-where-we-started ending questionable), it is a terrific film, a joy to watch. Yes, it is sometimes pretentious and much more hollow than it pretends to be, but it doesn't always matter simply because it pretends so well. The destructive and corruptive force behind drugs and promiscuity is hardly a revelation for the audience. Yet the story is compelling enough to enthrall us, directing good enough to amuse, shock or thrill at different times, and the acting is simply superb by everyone, from the always brilliant Seymour Hoffman to surprisingly talented Mark Wahlberg.
