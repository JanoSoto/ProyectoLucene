[{"date":"28 November 2006","score":"28 out of 42 people found the following review useful","review":" Wow! It finally happened! Steve Martin and Eddie Murphy Together! This movie is genius! There is so much going on here and Steve and Eddie are at their best. From the opening scene, you can just tell you are in for a real treat. This is one of my all time favorite movies. And people who voted less than excellent for this movie; either hate comedy or don't know how to enjoy real comedy. Eddie Murphy again does double duty playing two completely different characters, one more funnier than the next. Steve Martin plays the not so straight man director. This is a madcap screwball comedy. And the highway scene is tears crying down your face funny! I highly recommend this movie to any one who loves to really laugh! Unless your dead, you can't help but laugh. I don't mean chuckle, grin, smile etc. I mean laugh!!!!

I am a film student, and I have seen a lot of movies, and this movie was amazing. The outlandish humor that people chuckle at in the Austin Powers movies is nothing compared to this film. If you have an odd sense of humor like I do you will love this movie. This is a great parody on spaghetti westerns, and is just randomly delightful All I can say is wow. Even if you are dating someone new and want to see if they're a complete square, check this one out. You'll find out soon enough, I promise. At first only a few were laughing, but by the end of the movie, almost no one was without a wide open jaw or a grin as big as the west coast across their faces. You'll want to check this out. If nothing else, just to get with it, and see what it's like to be a part of the amazing film witnesses. That's all I can think to say right now, it's just the funniest thing I have seen in a while, if not ever.
