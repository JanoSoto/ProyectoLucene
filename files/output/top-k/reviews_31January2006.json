I must or would like to relate a story about my first viewing. In 2000, I lay at home awaiting a back surgery, severe sciatic nerve compression. My surgeon had placed me on very high doses of Morphine. Well, I laid in my bed with the TV glowing, drifting in and out of consciousness for several weeks. I had at sometime (although I do not remember doing so) watched at least half of this film. I know this because a potion of the film ( I found Later) was recorded on my VCR which stopped recording during a power outage. The day came for my surgery and off I went to hospital. Several hours later I lay in my hospital bed wrapped in warming blankets, again lost in a haze of opiates.I would drift away and hear, just barely, a soft vaguely familiar piece of music playing. Then came the dream. I found myself in a winter-scape constantly pursued by characters from the film. I have to say it was very unsettling and when I related this to my surgeon he assigned it to the high level of narcotics. But still he looked at me strangely. Two days passed and back in the operating room I went and out again. Still the dream haunted me. Well after I improved I was sent home to recover. On my initial follow-up visit with my Dr, he started the conversation off with,  have you ever seen a film entitled Ravenous? I thought and replied in the negative. It was a full 3 weeks before I ventured back up the steps to my bedroom, having no desire to climb steps. There in my VCR I found the unfinished recording. Suffice it to say I was much relieved. The dream had faded but, the whole episode was very real and unnerving.

It has plot holes all over the shop and the characters just don't make any sense, but if you're after a character-driven comedy that speaks to you on multiple levels, then you wouldn't be watching this in the first place. This film is about one thing only, making you laugh! And it does it better than any other film in 20 years since its inception. There can be no argument that this is Val Kilmer's finest moment, because despite the high-profile roles he has starred in since, he has rarely revisited his comic roots. Only in the 2005 film Kiss Kiss Bang Bang does he once again display his talent for brilliant dry delivery, and spot-on comic timing. Obviously, the plot is irrelevant, but it centres around an American singer caught up in a Plot from the Germans to, once again, take over the world. That really is all you need to know, because it's not important. The first time I watched this, I'd gotten home rather worse for wear, and flicked on the TV and some un-godly hour of the morning. Within 5 minutes I'd shouted at my mate to come and watch this crazy film, and the rest is history. None of my friends have still seen this film, but the two of us still fondly remember some of the fantastic gems that are contained within; the pacman scene upon arrival in Germany just blew our minds, the man chasing the tree still gets us every time, and as for Chocolate Mousse (Gasoline Ha Ha Ha!), well, if you haven't seen it, then it cannot be explained. Suffice to say, I love this film. I love it for what it is, because it doesn't try and pretend that it's a great film, it knows that it's a stupid comedy,and is extremely proud of it. This film has more hilarious moments in the first 10 minutes than almost all modern-day comedies can boast in their entire repertoire! To summarise, I'd say that everyone needs to see this film. Many will not find it funny, as it does appeal to a certain type of humour, but for those that get the first slapstick gag that they see, they are in for a treat! There are too many comic gems to list in this film, but I think I could pick out any 5 minutes of the feature and there would be something ingenious contained within. Just thinking about the hamster scene makes me chuckle!! It must be watched, it demands to be laughed at, and above all, it must certainly not be taken seriously!

We have been subjected to some real dross over the years but 'Living in Oblivion' is the proverbial exception to the rule, in that it isn't merely a conglomeration of funny disasters but they are assembled around a rather ingenious idea. As with every flick about film-making you have the different levels of the movie itself and the film that is in the making. This allows the director to switch between those different realities and blur the line between what is real and what might be merely a reproduction of reality. The basic location is a low budget film set run by a fairly incompetent and neurotic staff and apart from all the technical difficulties, true disaster strikes when the human factor raises its ugly head. The film can be roughly divided in three parts. In each part, hopelessly overworked director Nick Reve tries to cope with all the problems that can and inevitably will occur on any set and tries to prevent the whole thing from falling apart. With moderate success I might add. I don't know if you have to be interested in film making as such or if you even have to have some first hand experience to relate to this movie but I would have thought that its all kind of self explanatory. Although we would never have suspected it, the first two parts are dream sequences, thus giving the whole thing another level and hence another layer of reality, whilst the last one depicts the shooting of a dream sequence in real life. Quite clever methinks. However, the line between dream and reality is not quite as clear as you might think cause occurrences and events from the first two parts lead to what will happen in the third. All this is rather clever but what makes this an utter delight from start to finish is the directors eye for detail, how the whole thing just builds up and the great cast that is kinda stereotyped but spot on nevertheless. From the crappy catering and the bossy floor manager to the vain actor and the arty farty director everything fits just perfectly to depict an authentic scenario of underground film-making. I'm not really into comedies as such but I laughed out loud on several occasions during 'Living in Oblivion'. I really enjoyed it all the way through, but then maybe I'm a bit biased as Steve Buscemi is one of my favourite actors.

Posey also has a few other priceless lines in movies such as Best in Show, Of course I looked under the bed, thats where you look when you lose things and Dazed and Confused, Wipe that face off your head bitch. Waiting for Guffman is definitely a must see movie for everyone.

For me, I thought it was great because I thought that maybe to us right now the story might not seem to relevant (though I'm sure some people will relate to it) but to the people living in the era of the great depression, with many people being jobless and hungry, well, I'm sure the themes touched upon in this flick were very very relevant in those days.Thing is maybe todays working class don't suffer as much as they did in the past, but I'm sure to some degree people who work in a factory or in an office will find a degree of interest in these themes.

Gigantic sets depicting humongous machines twisting and turning, it all blew my mind. One of the machines the workers labor on..The Moloch Machine, wow, it just has to be seen to be believed. The sets and visual effects on this movie were some of the best for its time, and still look amazing to this day.The iconic Machine Man that the Rotwang the scientist creates in the film, is the grand daddy of C-3PO and The Terminators exo-skeleton or any other robot on any film. The sequences in which they are putting skin on the robot look amazing from a special effects point of view, specially considering that this movie was made 80 years ago! There's many visual delights that await whoever sees this movie. I know I was blown away when I saw the evil Maria doing some erotic dancing over at Rotwangs place. Its just visual eye candy. And speaking of the character Maria, I think that the actress who portrayed Maria (Brigitte Helm) really showed she could do her thing. Her facial expressions and contorted body gestures when she was evil really sold me on her. Plus her scenes dancing in the nightclub were really something.Of course there's some getting used to while seeing a silent film. I got used to filling in the blanks as they spoke in my mind.

The influence of The Matrix is unpleasantly obvious in the drab color scheme, which goes so far as to turn people green upon occasion (OUCH), and all the twiddly computer jazz we're supposed to be awe-stricken by.Give me a break.I have two names John Travolta. Don Cheadle.While I would by far prefer to see Travolta cavorting about as Tony Manero (Saturday Night Fever-brilliantly critiqued by user StarWarsDisco) it still must be said that he's always fun to watch. He's larger than life, and in his youth, was a very pretty boy. I respect his ability to work hard at a role, and he consistently gives me what I want. Entertainment.I do not look for depth and profundity in movies (especially those coming out of Hollywood). And I am always pathetically grateful when, unexpectedly, I find it. In the main, I want to be amused and entertained. I want the nepenthe a movie can give me without any harmful side effects. Done, and done, time and time again by Travolta.Don Cheadle is so solid, so good, and so competent, it breaks my heart to see him in this piece of tripe.Also, honorable mention must be given to Rudolph Martin as Axel Torvalds.That having been said, I will remark that Halle Berry's gratuitous semi-nudity, and excessive camped up performance as a manipulative sex goddess was so over the top in terms of bad acting, I was amazed enough by it to be able to stay awake 'til the bitter end.The transparency of her character was so offensively obvious, I guessed what she was about within seconds of her appearance. Only the village idiot would have been tricked into imagining she was one of the good guys.This is a terrible film. There was a 12-minute short at the end, with alternate endings, and standard producer-director enthusiastic drivel thrown in for good measure. They were possibly the least tiresome 12 minutes of the movie.The elected ending was weak and stupid. A little girl, who has been through unimaginable hell, has emerged sane, unscathed, and even able to be strong for Papa, remarking that, it's going to be alright... Oh yeah? And let's not forget Hugh Jackman, who grimaces, furrows his brows, and occasionally smirks his way through as the desperately devoted papa. Ho boy! A bad acting job if ever there was one.Oh feh. This is an old flick, already forgotten. No need for it to be battered into the ground any further, by one who, incidentally, tends to be the Devil's advocate, and champion of underdogs where heavily panned movies\/actors are concerned.

I have not seen the original, but I must say I really liked this one, and it may take a while for you to warm up To Reeves's character Nelson because he's an arrogant jackass at 1st, plus he and Charlize had fantastic chemistry together!. I thought the ending was very well done, even though I wished it didn't end that way, and I feel this should be higher then 5.5, plus it's very well made and written as well!.

Imagine expanding stars in our universe coming in contact with an outer ring of dark matter that repels the stars back toward the center of the Universe and you will understand the cosmic arrangement. The fact that Care Rank Ki Alien sentience evolved in a span of less than 20 billion years is impressive. As the Indian chief in the commercial about the Great Peace says You're here aren't you?

My favorite character would have to be Malachai, the hot red headed killer. He is just so hot and since I've seen it so many times, it's just really sad when he dies.

Nonetheless, I should still be impressed by the workmanship and production values, although in recent times production values has come to mean eye candy and excessive use of special effects technology. So perhaps it is best I just stick to workmanship; the movie should seem like a quality product made by professionals. Finally, something to talk about afterwards for those who haven't watched it yet, here is where the spoilers start, so I advice you stop reading. Just go watch it, or read a few more comments by other people and then make a decision. Okay, so, let the spoilers rollFrom the opening scenes, A Few Good Men held my interest. They set the tone for the rest of the movie by introducing the context, demonstrating the disciplined, ordered, co-ordinated m.o. of the armed forces, and slickly introduced Lt. Galloway and her struggle to manifest her intent with authority. Soon after we see what this show is about an accidental death which occurred under questionable circumstances... but as we watch on, there's a lot more to it.This is a movie that can leave people with different opinions by the end of it, but the important thing is that it provides the opportunity for intelligent discussion (or, less intelligent and more emotional discussion, if that's your cup of tea). Plus it inspired that all-time famous quote, you can't handle the truth!. The presentation is spot-on in that it is easy to forget you're watching a fictional movie rather than spying on real people involved in real situations; the suspension of disbelief is there. Also, the outcome of the case, and even the exact sequence of events, are not certain until the end (unless you read a spoiler or just guessed luckily). All in all, for a drama, this was really interesting. It's not at all like other military-court films which also involve extensive action sequences, and in a way that's refreshing. Even more refreshing is that minimal romantic involvement - personally, I hate that every story has to also have a romance side-story in it as well (but maybe that's just my personal loneliness speaking).

","genre":"Drama, Thriller"},{"date":"31 January 2006","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" I watched this movie a few hours before making this comment; but it has been out long enough that they are not only tons of comments here, but also a wider opinion that it is a good movie. So here, I will give my opinion of why I would call it a Perfect Ten, rather than just and eight (8) or nine(9).Movies are supposed to accomplish a few key things, in my humble opinion1. suspend disbelief 2. entertain for their duration 3. enhance the audience, or at least provide something interesting to talk about afterwards 4. showcase the talents of the crew, actors, and management who worked on making the movie a realityA movie doesn't have to be technically perfect, have 100% flawless continuity, or exacting dialogue in order to achieve a perfect score from me, because if the first two rules are met, then I won't notice those flaws during a casual viewing, and neither will 90% (or more) of the viewing audience. Nonetheless, I should still be impressed by the workmanship and production values, although in recent times production values has come to mean eye candy and excessive use of special effects technology. So perhaps it is best I just stick to workmanship; the movie should seem like a quality product made by professionals. Finally, something to talk about afterwards for those who haven't watched it yet, here is where the spoilers start, so I advice you stop reading. Just go watch it, or read a few more comments by other people and then make a decision. Okay, so, let the spoilers rollFrom the opening scenes, A Few Good Men held my interest. They set the tone for the rest of the movie by introducing the context, demonstrating the disciplined, ordered, co-ordinated m.o. of the armed forces, and slickly introduced Lt. Galloway and her struggle to manifest her intent with authority. Soon after we see what this show is about an accidental death which occurred under questionable circumstances... but as we watch on, there's a lot more to it.This is a movie that can leave people with different opinions by the end of it, but the important thing is that it provides the opportunity for intelligent discussion (or, less intelligent and more emotional discussion, if that's your cup of tea). Plus it inspired that all-time famous quote, you can't handle the truth!. The presentation is spot-on in that it is easy to forget you're watching a fictional movie rather than spying on real people involved in real situations; the suspension of disbelief is there. Also, the outcome of the case, and even the exact sequence of events, are not certain until the end (unless you read a spoiler or just guessed luckily). All in all, for a drama, this was really interesting. It's not at all like other military-court films which also involve extensive action sequences, and in a way that's refreshing. Even more refreshing is that minimal romantic involvement - personally, I hate that every story has to also have a romance side-story in it as well (but maybe that's just my personal loneliness speaking). Anyhow, the movie is great, you should see it.

Gregory Peck gives a strong characterization of the man, his genius as well as his egotism. With MacArthur you never knew quite where one began and the other left off and too many times they blended.The whole story of Douglas MacArthur would be a six hour film or a TV mini-series. It would cover him from his days on frontier posts with his family to his time at West Point where he still has the highest scholastic average ever achieved by a cadet. It would talk about his service in the Phillipines as a young officer, his legend building bravery on the battlefields of World War I in France. It would also have to tell about him firing on the Bonus Marchers of World War I veterans in 1932, probably putting the final kabosh on any chances President Herbert Hoover had of getting re-elected. During MacArthur's last years he and Hoover had penthouse suites at the Waldorf Astoria in New York City. That must have been a subject they avoided.This film concentrates on the years 1941 to 1952 and it is told in flashback. The film opens with MacArthur addressing the student body in 1962. As he speaks the words of the famous Duty Honor Country speech, MacArthur's mind goes back to World War II and his desperate struggle against the advancing Japanese on the island of Corregidor and the fields of Bataan on Luzon. The film takes him through his struggle to win back the Phillipines, the occupation of Japan and the first 18 months culminating in his relief of command by President Truman.MacArthur as a film would not work at all if it wasn't for the portrayals of Dan O'Herlihy and Ed Flanders as Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman respectively. It's the part of the film I enjoyed the best, seeing MacArthur and his relations with both these men.FDR by O'Herlihy captures the aristocratic squire and exceptionally devious man that was our 32nd President. Roosevelt was a man who got his points across with unusual subtlety and cleverness. Sometimes he liked scheming a little too much for its own sake, but he was the master politician of the last century. Note how he deals with MacArthur both as a battlefield commander and potential rival at the same time.Truman by Flanders is as people remember him, a blunt spoken man of the people who disliked MacArthur's haughtiness from the gitgo. Of course it's in the history books how Truman relieved MacArthur in 1951 for insubordination. MacArthur was insubordinate, no doubt about it.Yet I could write a whole thesis on the Truman-MacArthur relations. Along the way it need not have ever come to a crisis. I've always felt that FDR would have dealt with the whole matter in a far better way had he still been president then.MacArthur was also grandly eloquent and Gregory Peck captures some of that eloquence in some of the orations that made him as much a legend as victories on the battlefield. Listen to Peck at the Japanese surrender, at MacArthur's farewell to the nation before the joint session of Congress, and of course his speech to the cadets in 1962. Watch the newsreels and see if you don't agree.
