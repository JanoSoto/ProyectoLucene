Why? I think everybody who saw this movie knows whether he like it not; I just want to say some words about that.The movie is not just about showing the lifestyle in the 13th century; not just about showing the pain...-how much does it hurt, how hard is it to take,when something happens to our love, when we can do nothing to help her when she is dying; how cruel is to fight a war; how BRAVE it is to stand the torture-it's not just about these things...What we can see in the movie,or what we can FEEL the feeling inside our heart, how are we just falling apart when we are watching it,just watching the people dying for FREEDOM. We can be there,stand in the middle of the battlefield and feel the warm blood in our face and passion in our soul,because we are fighting for our homeland. We see the pain in the eyes of our friends, who are watching us dying....and the last word...FREEDOM. Everything what's important in the movie is inside that one single word,all the feelings; everything. In the last battle,in the end of the movie we cannot even sit in our chair.We need to stand up,or do something with our hands (we are just so excited) ,because we haven't seen the movie yet but we can feel it, feel the incredible power of people who want to be free,and we know who's going to win the battle.

I expected not to like them at all. But I ended up thinking The Godfather was extremely good, and Godfather 2 even better.. You don't have to be into mafia-stuff to like these movies at all!Now for number 3 I kind of expected to like it just as much as the other twos. I thought the bad critics was mainly cynical. But, in some ways I found them to be quite right indeed. Sophia Coppola is today a great director in my opinion. I loved both of her present movies. In this movie she's playing Michael Corleone's daughter, and she really doesn't suit the character. The movie also suffers from a bit of a loose grip. I had to watch this movie over three days because I found myself too impatient to watch it. The other two movies are also slow in a sense, but they kind of held a grip on you all the way. On the better side the movie does bring a lot of completing segments into the saga. It shows a lot of the afterlife of the mafia affairs which Michael Corleone is trying to stop once and for all now. Andy Garcia plays his part good as well. The confession scene is one of the best scenes of the saga even maybe. Its a good movie. And its a good closing of the saga. Very slow though.

There are so many directors that are content to make blatantly unoriginal works but Spielberg is the most original and ethical crowd-pleaser in America. And yet he is considered one of the men who ruined cinema. People complain that his Jaws was so successful that it encouraged producers to make hackwork movies that will undoubtedly make millions (bringing Hollywood cinema to where it is today). First of all, George Lucas's Star Wars is more responsible for this. Secondly, who are we to blame Spielberg for the deeds of the producers\/filmmakers who were (superficially) influenced by him? What annoys me even more than this is that so few people realize that his films keep getting better as his career goes on (with the exception of Schindler's List, Amistad, the Jurassic Park movies, and Saving Private Ryan). Jaws is probably his least impressive extremely impressive film he has made. The Color Purple, for example, which was made in the 80s, is one of his best films to date. It is so dripping with complexity and detail; it differs from Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan in the sense that, when you watch it, you don't think, 'Oh this is a movie about the life of an African American family in the early twentieth century.' 'Themes' and 'topics' fade away and the film just becomes&#133;life. It is about people, not historical figures. Danny Glover plays Albert, a nasty man who marries Celie (Whoopi Goldberg). He is furiously disappointed with the fact that he did not get to marry Netti (Akosua Busia), Celie's sister. As a result, he beats Celie and, as a result of that, Celie becomes painfully quiet and unable to smile without putting her hand in front of her mouth. The relationship between Celie and Albert is hard-hitting, melancholic, and funny. Neither character is treated cartoonishly and both actors play their characters with fairness and delicacy. This is not a work of easy melodrama. It makes you think about subjects such as femininity, the black population's quest for independence at the beginning of the new century, and the eruption of violence in a relationship without ever cheating or faltering a single step.

Imagined presence of colleagues at the University where he teaches mathematics and imagined conversations with them suggest that his brain is playing tricks with him.

This is intentional for we are seeing life through the eyes of a man suffering terribly from mental illness. It is disturbing to watch, yet fascinating. It makes you feel uncomfortable. Watch closely and you will see patterns on a window pane and patterns of shadows across a flight of steps and patterns taking shape in a jumble of letters of coded text. It is almost as if the mind is too active. And lurking in the shadowy background there is always a threatening figure watching him...or is he just imagined?

Jealousy. Lust, jealousy. And all you feel is pity for Malena. I feel this film suffers from wanting to show us too much of what it could have implied. It is obvious that Malena is devastatingly beautiful, and that she is set apart from the other women because of it. I think that Monica Bellucci did a good job at acting, because she probably knew the director was going to make the themes so in-your-face(guess which themes I'm talking about..women are ALL heartless, jealous women and men are all hopeless hornballs) that the audience isn't going to want an actress who goes over the top as well. The emotions that are practically thrown at you, feel this way right now becomes more and more annoying as the film progresses. Then the scary thing happens you realize either the director NEVER planned to have character and plot development in his movie or he got ahead of himself and couldn't fit it in at the last minute.I don't want to discount the plus sides to this film it is cinematic ally serene, beautiful, and besides all the other bad acting Monica does a great job (with the little she has.) There was just never any focus on Malena as a thinking, breathing, intelligent human being. And no, that doesn't necessarily mean a lot more dialog, but MAYBE a little.

John Woo directed it. The man who wrote Chinatown did the screenplay. Thandie Newton was in it. Everything sounds great. So what happened? MI2 is a mess, and not even an entertaining mess. For an action film, it's quite boring at times. There are long gaps between action sequences, and one has to endure some of the worst romantic dialog to come out of Hollywood in some time. Thandie Newton, who was so charming in the otherwise mediocre Truth About Charlie, is totally wasted here. I'm still trying to figure out how Robert Towne goes from writing Chinatown, which was so intelligent and stylish, to this dreck, which makes some of the bad, late-night, low-budget action shows on cable TV look pretty well-developed and coherent. An absolute flop of a screenplay. This was the first film I had ever seen by John Woo, and I can only assume that his earlier work is what gave him such a good reputation. When he finally does give us action sequences, they go on far too long and often seem ridiculous. If you find the opening sequence of the film - Tom Cruise rock climbing - silly and unbelievable, stop the video there and go on to something else, because it's not going to get any better. The worst combination for an action film is to be dumb AND pretentious, and that is what Woo accomplishes in MI2. His trademark use of slow-motion gets old quick and leaves you feeling like you're watching some slick perfume ad on TV. This is especially true towards the end of the film, when doves come flying out of the smoke and fire. Rather than care about the climax of the story, I'm wondering if a naked, anorexic blonde angel is going to appear and whisper Action Film, the new fragrance from Calvin Klein. It's just silly stuff, with no sly, tongue-in-cheek awareness of its own silliness.And there are so many holes in the script... And those masks... What is it with the masks? It works the first time, seems old the second time and is just plain ridiculous the third time.I'm guessing Woo was an influence on the Wachowski Brothers, so I could be reading this wrong, but he seems to rip off several elements from The Matrix, which was released a year earlier. If only he had bothered to make MI2 as tight and smart as that film!If you're an action fan, get the DVD and skip to the chapters with the fight\/chase sequences. The story doesn't make much sense and the actors struggle with the terrible screenplay, so you're not missing anything important.

I'm sure you will have a new outlook on this great horror if you do! 9\/10 ","genre":"Horror, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"8 November 2004","score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" Although I have never read Lewis Carroll's novel, I can still appreciate the creativity and imagination that went into this story. Alice in Wonderland will always be one of my favorites, if not just for the absolute originality of the story, for the lack of an obviously physically romantic part to the story. Almost un-Disney-like, no two people fall in love or chase each other throughout the movie. Instead, the romance occurs in the truest sense of romance - all in Alice's imagination. She is a very passionate character and chases what she wants. She follows her curiosity and takes chances, without regard to the consequences. Although she tries to make the best of the situations she gets herself in, she is always true to her character. She tries her hardest to follow the rules she was taught - be polite, sit up straight, say yes your highness - but she's just a little girl, and not all rules are meant to be kept. The essence of Alice's character keeps the story alive, in addition to all the incredible people she meets. I get irritated when people attribute the creativeness of this story to drugs or other substances, because they disregard the originality of the story. Who knows if the substance theory is true? But honestly, who cares?! Regardless of whatever Lewis Carroll did to get this story, the end result was this absolutely genius story. I have not seen or read any story that can compete with Alice in Wonderland in terms of creating the impossible and making it seem possible. You may or may not agree with me, but I will always cherish this movie for these reasons.

They call it farcical, uneven, clichéd. They find it farcical, I believe, because the film revels in the absurdity of war rather than gloss over it. They would rather watch a film, like Saving Private Ryan, which ignores absurdity in favor of violence. These people find it uneven because the important scenes (like the D-Day and North African invasion) take only a minute or two to conclude, while other scenes, less typical of a war movie, spread out before us. They call it clichéd because the movie is unsubtle in its treatment of character development and plot.I cannot agree with these beliefs. The Big Red One is not only one of the greatest WWII films, it is also one of the greatest war movies.Sam Fuller's film, which was butchered by the studio, is the picaresque tale of 5 members of the First Infantry, known, because of their shoulder patch, as the Big Red One. The film moves from one story to the next without spending too much time on any particular tale.The individual vignettes, as they must, vary in quality, but on the whole are excellent. The Big Red One stirs within you a desire to run right out and tell your friends about this amazing scene or that.There's the soldier who loses his testicle, the birthing scene in the belly of a tank, Lee Marvin, in Middle Eastern garb, traipsing across a beach, soldiers dug into holes over which a Panzer tank division travels, the entire Mad House segment... The list goes on.Some people dislike the absurdest nature of several of this film's stories, but, for me, those surreal touches make this film great.Without them (and there are a lot), you would be left with a very normal and very boring film. Using bandoleers as stirrups is genius, as is the woman faking crazy as she whirls through a monastery, slicing German throats.The performances are solid, for this type of film, but if you are looking for subtlety, go elsewhere. Each character is drawn in broad strokes; you never learn too much about them, but you learn enough to understand who they are and why. Lee Marvin, as usual, is amazing. He is one of the great, gruff actors of our time, bringing a special, intangible quality to every film in which I've seen him. He makes every movie he's in better just by showing up. There are too few actors about whom you can say that.Like the acting, the direction is masculine, but, for a war movie, that's a compliment. In some ways, Fuller's direction here and in his other films reminds me of Hemmingway's writing - terse and effective. Both men believe in an economy of shots or words, depending on their medium, but, through that economy, they attain a muscular sort of poetry akin to the beauty of a horse's rippling muscles as it races on a plain. Fuller's direction here, though not his best when compared to Underworld USA or Shock Corridor, is still better than most, especially considering that this was his first film in several years.All in all, I find the Big Red One to be an exemplary war movie, even in its emasculated format (I cannot wait to see the restored, 140 minute print, which should improve upon scenes that feel to brief in this version). It's certainly no Apocalypse Now, but it puts to shame most World War II epics before or since.

The kids at the camp are going to be counselors, but they have to get everything straitened up first. People don't like the fact that the camp is getting started up, because some kids have died there before. Now, the deaths are starting up again, and once again, kids at the camp are getting killed.After watching the film once again, without seeing it in years, this is what I think It is a very good movie. Like a lot of films, you just have to have a specific love for old campy slasher movies. This was made in 1980. A time where the majority of horror movies didn't really have much of a plot, just a bunch of kids getting sliced and diced.
