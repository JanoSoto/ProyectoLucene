[{"date":"1 January 2001","score":"4 out of 8 people found the following review useful","review":"  Elizabeth is a visually pleasing movie that also includes some nice acting and memorable scenes. If one is interested in History, however, it sadly leaves a lot to be desired. I speak not of whether or not Queen Elizabeth was a virgin - we will never know for sure. What is egregious is the moving up of the execution of the Duke of Norfolk by several decades, and Elizabeth's dismissal of Cecil early in her reign, when in fact he served as her principal advisor until his dying day about 40 years later. I guess the movies simply won't make a historically accurate film.
