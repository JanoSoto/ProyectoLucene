That it's as good as it is may be because it began by being Kubrick's, but in the end Spielberg directed AND wrote the script it's his effort and his credit.  Those viewers who reported a tug-of-war between Kubrick and Spielberg were imagining things.  (Perhaps they viewed the film under the influence of the popular, false view that Kubrick's films are always chilly and misanthropic while Spielberg's are always warm and generous.)  Of course, Kubrick would have done it all differently, and since he's the better director part of me wishes he HAD done it, but it's obvious enough that the film is a whole one, NOT at war with itself in any respect.The subject matter is a stretch for Spielberg, but then, that's nothing new the same was true, at the time, of his three other greatest films Jaws, Raiders of the Lost Ark and Schindler's List.  What's new this time is the sheer SCOPE of the story.  Few films cover this much ground (at least, few do so without losing their footing).  Another interesting novelty for the first time in a Spielberg film, children (human children, that is) are accurately depicted as being monsters - and we're NOT invited to suppose that their nasty traits are somehow cute.  Quite apart from this, notice how completely the lingering sense of patriotism (on behalf of flesh-and-blood humanity) which almost always gets in the way when we try to properly appreciate a story of this kind, has been neutralised.  (Of all the films I've ever seen Bambi is the only other one that succeeds in neutralising this patriotism - and Bambi is far less ambitious.)You can't deny it's a lovely fable ... can you?  Well, some people do.  I don't understand why.  (If the consecutive endings bother you, bear in mind that consecutive endings constitute no defect when each ending is indeed a more fitting and beautiful conclusion, to EVERYTHING that has gone before, than the previous one was.)  But suppose, for the sake of argument, that the various parts of the film DON'T hold together (I know, I know).  Even so, the parts justify themselves.SPOILERS FOLLOW...Monica (the mother) is an intriguing character at first, she's obsessed (pathologically so) with her comatose son, but when she comes to love David, and then has her son Martin returned to her, and then discovers that she can't have both Martin and David ... well, her decision to abandon David in the woods actually speaks well of her, given the options she had open to her.  I get the feeling she would have preferred to abandon Martin in the woods, but (for obvious reasons) couldn't do so.  Even among truly great directors, nine out of ten directors would have made the mother a locus of bestial irrationality; she is, instead, the most clear-eyed and reasonable person (organic OR mechanical) present.More well-judged details  David is convincing as a robot designed to feel love, but not to act so as to inspire it.  I'll bet nobody guessed what a flesh fair would turn out to be.  The futuristic flying machine at the end is merely a cute and original design when we first see it and think it was built by aliens; when we find it's the work of future, hyper-advanced robots, it turns out to be exactly the kind of thing they WOULD think of - a virtual aircraft, as it were.  Williams's score is one of his very his best (considered as a score).  The spinach scene is suitably creepy.  The moonrise is surely one of the most stunning visual ideas in cinema history.  All in all, the art direction is amazing.  Everyone who went to see the latest Star Wars because they wanted to drink in jaw-dropping futuristic visions should have seen this instead - on a visual basis alone, they would have got twelve times more bang for their buck.The only real flaw (apart from a technical detail which irks me but which isn't really worth mentioning here - you can find it in the goofs section on this site) is the title.

This was actually good, though.A teenager who desperately wants a car finds a watch that enables him to enter hypertime, where everything around him stops (or goes rrrreeeeaaalllyyy slow). But there are (what else?) people after the watch, which actually stops his antics with the watch, and puts his life and his father's at risk.Some things aren't right. For example, if you were moving so fast, than how come (I think) a television set isn't moving as fast as him? (It would be constantly remaking the image, not showing it just as slow as everything around him.) Also, if the watch allows anything touching him to go into hypertime as well, and he's touching the ground, than how come everything doesn't go into hypertime minus the airplanes in the air?

Directed by the talented Ahn-Hung Tran, a Vietnamese\/French director. This is his second film after the critically acclaimed `Scent of a Green Papaya'. The film looks and feels like a visual poem, and you can't do anything but be awestricken by the sheer intensity and power of the images and their composition that are expressed towards you. Even if their exact meaning isn't always clear to us.In visual terms I would say that the director borrows more from photographers and video artists than other films. What emerges from this is a bold and powerful film. But unlike his fellow film director such as Wong Kar-Wai (In the Mood for Love, Fallen Angels), whose films can sometimes give you the same feel as leafing through a hip photo magazine. Tran's film is more collected, even though it can be made a point out of the plot at times being a bit sketchy.The story circles around a young cyclo (played by Le Van Loc), a bicycle taxi driver (pedicab),  his older sister and her lover \/ ex-lover the local hoodlum, know as the poet ( played by Hong Kong star Tony Leung). We don't learn any of their real names; even the film credits them as the cyclo, the sister, the poet, the grandfather, the madam etc. The cyclo has lost both his parents and is currently living with his siblings and his grandfather. The film gives us a unique view of the contrasts and the poverty of Saigon. Everyone in this household has to work, in order to make ends meet. The cyclo drives his pedicab looking for passengers. His younger sister shines shoes after school. The beautiful older sister cooks and carries water from the marked, and even the old grandfather repairs tyres.  The chain of events starts rolling when the cyclo gets jumped by rivals who steal his pedicab and beat him up. The cyclo who was employed by the local gang boss, the madam, is now forced into taking up petty crimes, under her sponsorship to pay for his cab. But instead of returning to a normal life, he is pressured by the madam's gang led by the silent gangster the poet, to commit even more violent crimes, on madams behalf.The poet  however, is at the same time living a second life as a pimp, under which guise he recruits the cyclos elder sister (presumably because she and her family need the money). There is also a clear indication that she and the poet are either lovers or have been so.But trying to follow or find the plot of the film is missing the whole point of this film. Events occur suddenly for no direct reason, while other times, events don't occur as you as a viewer expect them to. The film follows a dynamic structure reflecting the human spontaneity. Events are sometimes difficult to make out, because the director clearly doesn't believe in feeding us information with a spoon. It's liberating to watch a film that isn't afraid of its audience, and deliberately has a storytelling that leaves much up to our imagination and interpretation of event.  There is such room for speculation, because Tran leaves a whole continent of emotions and information unexposed.Let me just point out that this is not a bad thing in anyway. We are raised upon a tradition of films that force-feed us their purpose. Formula based clichés where you know where the film is going and what's going to happen after watching 10 min of it. What Ahn-Hung Tran does is both daring and plausible breaking new ground and expanding our horizons.As I mentioned, that trying to follow the plot is to miss the point of this film. It reminds me of French new wave aesthetics and the work by John Cassavetes. While most films and their characters are more about doing instead of being, this film does the direct opposite. It seems like the story is serving the purpose of exposing a distinct character emotions, instead of the western plot driven stories, where characters serve as devices to push the plot forward. Tran has a great eye for visual composition and picking out details he want to show. The films story could easily have turned into something uninteresting and shallow. But the attention the right detail along with the decision to show consequences of situations instead of action and confrontation makes this a unique insight of human nature.The main characters are all mostly silent throughout the film. This strengthens the feeling of them being almost passive accepting of the choices pressed upon them. Because the cyclo, his sister and the poet are all in one way or another force to do what they're doing, either by each other or by their environment. With this minimal amount of dialog, the majority of the scenes are more dependant of the characters actions or more their reactions. Their expressions and body language conveys their desires and torments, without ever becoming sentimental.Ahn Hung Tran's storytelling suits the exquisite  minimalist approach the cinematographer Benoit Delhomme turns toward the material. The films fixation with fluids is also quite interesting choice. All kind of fluids play a visual and symbolic role throughout the entire film water, mud, sweat, paint, even urine and blood. Everything ads to the visual flow of the film.Evoking an incredible atmosphere of chaos, helter-skelter activity that seems to follow no law, the strength of cyclo lies in its imagery. Stunning colours and cascade of metaphors, on many different levels, constructs a coherent picture of the world. The main story is regularly intertwined by photomontages from Saigon everything from the city streets of Saigon, or a montage of all the residents of a particular block, classroom of children singing Vietnamese songs. And a quite surreal funny scene of a helicopter carrier that tips over with its military helicopter, in the middle of heavy street traffic. Everything is connected with a kind of dream logic that's hard to define, where things just fit together even if they logically shouldn't.The film is a beautiful daring triumph, which isn't afraid of its audience. It will make you reflect over it long after you have seen it. And isn't that what all good art should do ?

Successfully surpassing the elements of a standard thriller, the movie contains enough original and interesting content and evokes genuine compassion for, if not the characters, at least the situation. Easy to identify with, the themes of the film are ones to make you think, though the story is fairly simple.   It all starts with a minor traffic accident. A Wall Street Lawyer, Gavin Banek (Ben Affeleck) on his way to the courtroom, and a recovering alcoholic father, Doyle Gibson (Samuel L. Jackson) on his way to a custody hearing meet briefly after a fender bender. In a rush to make it to the hearing, Banek refuses to exchange insurance information and instead cuts Gibson a check and leaves him insulted and without a ride. This single incident sparks a chain of events that begins with Gibson missing his custody hearing and losing his wife and kids; and Banek making a fool of himself in court without an important document and signature. Guess what happened to that document... That's right, Sam's got it. The rest of the film takes place over the course of that same day as both men go to extraordinary lengths to try and salvage their individual situations. Banek must get that file, by any means necessary, or risk losing his job and possibly going to jail for fraud if he is unable to produce that signature. Gibson's close to rock bottom, and given how he was treated not quite so keen on giving back the file. Both men blame each other for the downward spiral the day their lives have entered, and push each other's buttons to the point of no return. Intense stuff, even if the action in the film is limited.  The movie works because not only is the situation believable and on a smaller scale identifiable, but the writing reflects equally believable behavior and dialogue. Written by Chap Taylor, his first credit as a screenwriter, I believe, and rewritten by Michael Tolkin (The Player) the foundation of the film is strong. Almost everything really good about Changing Lanes is because of the script. I suspect, in fact, that the original screenplay was probably even better, with more substance than the final product. I suspect a bit of trimming and compromise may not have helped, but it certainly didn't hurt much either. As I mentioned, the movie does work. Visually there were pros and cons. Sick of blatantly flashy and labored direction, I liked the simple, more traditional approach to the film. It was a bit flat, though, compared to some of the good stuff I've seen from the same director. It's not a movie to see if you're looking for pure eye candy, nor is it a movie I'd recommend if you're looking for a lot of action.Changing Lanes is a fairly engaging movie. A solid movie, that was much better than I expected and with a lot more to offer than the promos promise. This one came in under the radar, maybe a little too low. Possibly too much promotion may have done it more harm, because it's not a big summer movie that will please an adrenaline hungry audience; but it does deserve to get some attention. Good casting and good performances, even if neither are a stretch for the two leads. The movie has great supporting performances by William Hurt as Doyle Gibson's AA sponsor and especially the incredible Toni Collette as Banek's assistant and love interest (not to be confused with his wife). Above all a solid script deserves the most credit. Changing Lanes has been the first really pleasant surprise in a new film this year.

It focuses on themes that are easily associated with everyday life.  Sure, I'm fascinated with the way this film connects the themes to the Hawaiian 'ohana' concept.Ohana, for any Hawaiian, means a group of people (closely and distantly related) who share nearly everything. Yep, sharing is the core of ohana value. Hawaiians believe that duties to 'ohana' will help them increase their mana (spirituality). The concept of `immediate family' is alien to native Hawaiians. I'm not sure whether the very young viewers will be able to grasp this association, but I'm convinced they would definitely grasp and enjoy watching the development of friendship between the environmental-conscious, little Lilo and the koala-gremlin like, extra-terrestrial Stitch.Two characters who are so different in appearance, yet almost similar in behavior and traits. I've no doubt that it would tickle the young viewers to catch the mischievous behaviors of these characters on screen. Also, there's enough action and plenty of wacky and weird looking characters in this film to hold up their interest and attention. Young lads would most certainly applaud the sci-fi creativity. And there's nothing crude or terrifying to tempt contempt from their parents. This film has a fair amount of humor, but I'm not convinced that kids below the age of 5 would be able to recognize most of it. Overall, the movie is paced well and the length of the story is appropriate - even for the very young kiddies.The artistic style of this movie pumps up memories of the traditional animated cartoon medium of Freddie Moore, Ollie Johnston, Frank Thomas and Eric Larson. But I wouldn't say it's simplicity at its best.  The characters lack the charisma and color of those characters of Monsters, Inc.

However, I'm grateful for the familiar Queen Liliuokalani's composition `Aloha O'e.'The voices of Tia Carrera and Jason Scott Lee succeed in giving their characters the Hawaiian credibility. But overall, the voices given to the majority of characters don't appear to energize the characters' personalities.  Only Stitch's character is cool and pretty credible. an alien whose actions definitely speak louder than words. He is the character that truly brings out laughter from the children sitting around me!Obviously, this film pays a great deal of homage to Elvis. Quite appropriate, I must say!

There, that said, let's get on with the other stuff.  First of all, this movie is about El Dorado and some guys going after it, right?  El Dorado was a freakin' king, okay? and he lived in South America.  And a Maya city would not be named El Dorado in the first place.  It would be named something like Chichen Itzá or Tikal, all right.  The Indians didn't speak Spanish. (Which is why people shouldn't be confused about Caracol because caracol means 'snail' in Spanish so that can't be the original name of the city).  By the way, who are these Indians?  Are they Aztecs, Toltecs, Olmecs, Mayas, Incas...Another thing, and this would be the biggest mistake in the whole movie...the villain.  This whole thing about the priest being evil is ridiculous.  In the time of the Maya, Aztecs and most especially the Toltecs, human sacrifice was widely popular and widely accepted...BY EVERYONE!  It was considered honorable to commit suicide even.  They even had their own suicide goddess for peets sake!  The filmmakers are so ignorant, it is sickening.  I understand that little American children don't want to see the losers of the Ball Game having their heads chopped off on a Chac Mool but then don't make the movie!
