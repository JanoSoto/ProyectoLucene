Mike (A. Michael Baldwin in the beginning) narrowly escapes capture by The Tall Man (Angus Scrimm) and his army of zombified dwarfs thanks to the efforts of his friend Reggie (Reggie Bannister). After a narrow escape, Mike is placed in a psychiatric hospital and a young girl named Liz (Paula Irvine) does a voice-over stating she is involved with The Tall Man as well. Eight years later, Mike (now portrayed by James LeGros) is let out and he and Reggie go on a hunt in search of The Tall Man, following his trail of victimized towns that have been wiped out and turned into his followers while in search of Liz additionally, who is telepathically connected to Mike through their association with The Tall Man and become romantically involved. Together Mike, Reggie, and Liz fight together in effort to put an end to The Tall Man's mysterious evil once and for all.The Phantasm movies arn't exactly very well known known which is too bad because they are great films. The second installment of the series can easily be considered it's highest point. The first film was a great movie and a definite classic but this one just kind of expands on everything. Phantasm II has a completely different mood from the atmospheric original; this one is more of an action\/adventure film in a fantasy\/horror setting. This is not a bad thing really since those looking for a thrill have come to the right place and for horror fans, the film is still pretty creepy. Thanks to a much bigger budget than the first, there are loads of great special effects in this film, which is essential for a film with as many fantasy elements as this. I'm amazed the original got as far as it did with such a small budget, especially since that one was more focused on fantasy elements. The famous silver spheres of which the series is famous for make a return in this film, only this time there are a bunch of them plus a large gold sphere in this one as opposed to the single sphere in the original. Charicter's in this film are great as they are very likable and and they actor's who play them are great; James LeGros does a great portrayal of Mike despite the fact that he isn't Michael Baldwin, Reggie Bannister is bad-ass as usual, Paula Irvine is terrific as Liz (it's a shame she stopped acting), Samantha Phillips is good as mysterious hitch-hiker Alchemy, and Angus Scrimm of course gives another great performance as The Tall Man.There isn't really much about this film to complain about. I liked it a lot more than I should have but still. It has an interesting plot, great characters, a mysterious villain, a bald guy with a quad-barrel shotgun who used to sell ice cream, and flying spheres that drill people's brains out ) It's definitely not a film everyone will like but it's definitely one to check out. I loved it and many other reviewers did too. Those concerned about content the film had a bit of blood but isn't terribly gory; most of the violence more or less comes from the spheres who only kill two people. There is also a brief sex scene with a little nudity but other than swearing thats about it. The film is written and directed by Don Coscarelli, who wrote and directed the other three films in the series (and an upcoming fifth and final one) as well as classics like The Beastmaster and Bubba Ho-Tep.The BreakdownPROS Solid acting, likable and interesting character's, attractive women (Paula Irvine and Samantha Phillips), a revamped version of the already awesome Phantasm theme (one of the best tunes ever; ranks with Terminator and Halloween), great FX and special effects, a few good quotes, great action, and the plot is pretty good as well.CONS As of June 7, 2007 there are no plans to release this on DVD (which is flat out pathetic), kind of confusing at times, and as the 5.8 rating suggests it's not a film for everyone. There really isn't much that is bad to say about this in the end.OVERALL Phantasm II is not only a worthy sequel to a classic original but ranks with films like Terminator 2 and Aliens as a rare sequel that manages to be just as good as the original. It is also very different in style and the film's score is awesome. Should you have interest in seeing this, be sure to see the original Phantasm first since this one begins right as that one ends. I highly recommend this one, I love this series and this film is incredible. It's highly recommended as at least a rent to watch if you have nothing better to do, are in the mood for a movie, or whatever. Phantasm II is a thrilling action\/horror flick and I recommend the whole franchise as well. Only if you really liked the character of Liz like I did the way Coscarelli treats her in the beginning of the next installment will be a huge disappointment.Rated R Grisly Fantasy Violence, Language, and some Sexual Content Runtime 1 hour and 36 minutes Score 10\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"8 June 2007","score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" Phantasm II literally begins where the original Phantasm ended.

I'm not really certain I've ever seen him really act......this could be one of those famous incidences that evolved in early B&W movies, where certain actors\/actresses played the same role (in every picture), because people liked them so much. Newman may have worked as a cowboy for a spell, but he didn't bring much experience away from that, only complimented what he was already very good at doing. For instance, the very handsome and young Garfield, who came from a very famous, stage-acting group, so beautiful, who died at 39), who DID play other roles, but Hollywood mostly always cast him in those B-picture, tough-guy roles. Ditto, Edward G. Robinson, whose face became a permanent scowl from looking tough. The list goes on....I give Hud a 10, not for Newman, but for the entire cast which told this story so openly, plainly and effectively. It doesn't take any second thought to thoroughly understand the plot - a very good one, thanks to Martin Ritt (director) and Larry McMurty (writer). I agree that the stark cinematography told just as much as the dialogs, and compliment every other actor\/actresses cast here. With his eternal youth, Newman must have been much older than when other films using this same character were shot, unless they were simultaneously filmed. Did anyone else notice that Newman was as-flat-as-a-pancake in the bun dept, and did not display a muscular torso ? Unheard-of for that kind of role ! His handsomeness, and those clear-blue eyes, obviously made him a hit at the box-office - and, his unaffected speaking-voice - as Katherine Hepburn told Anthony Hopkins for The Lion in Winter, don't act, just say the lines.People may have gone to the theater to see Newman, but Hud was definitely Patricia Neal's (Alma Brown) movie. SHE got the Oscar, huh? I think many people realized she always fully developed every role she played, without over-acting and another clear speaking-voice. (TCM has done a fabulous, original interview in which one sees the REAL Neal, down-to-earth woman........with a little cussin' involved.) As late as '63, the ladies were still considered to be only game for wolves as victims for predators such as Hud. I forgot, at this viewing, she was the one that got away........I thought I remembered she had been raped and that incident was one of the burdens that speeded-up Homer's demise. Brava! for Neal......What happened to Brandon de Wilde (Lonnie)? I keep looking for him in other films, but I guess he was just too innocent-looking and good ole American boy (and too pretty) for different roles. His vulnerability in Hud (and other movies) certainly was a very important contrast to Newman's role. Melvyn Douglas (pop Homer (another Oscar-winner for this film) had done many brilliant roles pre-and-post Hud - he was outstanding in this plot.Another unexpected character for Hud was Newman's pink Caddy.......not too many real cowboys would have zoomed-around in something THAT loud, if they wanted to keep their macho image. (Not even Hollywood's bad-boys would seldom risk losing that.) It was as much a part of Hud's infamous personality for ride 'em all as was his swagger.Hud is the classic portrayal of a bad-seed son and a principled dad. (East of Eden).

The viewer is likely to find himself or herself from the girl and not from the medical staff or from other normal people. The girl doesn't seem to be mentally unstable at all if you compare her to the other patients at the institute.The storyline of Girl, Interrupted is excellent but that will soon become of only secondary importance because the moment you see Angelina Jolie as Lisa for the first time you'll realize who will steal the show. Even if you are not particularly a fan of Jolie you have to admit that the role was made for her. The sociopath Lisa always keeps something going on and the story will move forward as much as it is possible inside those walls.Surely you could look for social commentaries from this film but I think that analysis would only say that this is a boring movie, which it is not.

No baby boomer who saw it when first released in 1960 will ever forget it. I remember it was all the kids on the playground talked about at school, for months. And everyone envied our buddy Bradford because his mom had bought the Alamo's color program. They sold programs in the lobby in those days. In those days, a major picture was treated like a Broadway play, a big event. And none was bigger than the Alamo. The Alamo had everything the legendary Triumvirate of John Wayne as Davy, Richard Widmark as Bowie, and Lawrence Harvey as Travis, backed by arguably the greatest cast of character actors in film history -- Richard Paladin Boone as Houston, Hank Worden as Parson, he seemed to play Parson or Mose or something like that in every Wayne film, Guinn Big Boy Wiiliams as Irish, Chill Wills as Beekeeper, Denver Dukes of Hazzard Pyle as Thimblerig the Gambler, Frankie Avalon as Smitty, Ken Gunsmoke Curtis as Dickerson, and on and on. Dimitri Tiomkin's Alamo film score is only now recognized as the superb modern classical music it was. So great was his score that for a generation of film-goers, when the Alamo is mentioned in any context you hear Green Sleeves of Summer or the Deguello in the back of your mind.The kids in our group who were the first to go see it in 1960 all raved about it, particularly the heroic, perhaps over-the-top, last stands of each of the historic Alamo legends. When the rest of us later saw the film, then as youngsters, and many more times as adults, the film did not disappoint. Few scenes have been more exciting and moving than Wayne's Davy, dying from a bayonet in the chest, but summoning one last bit of energy to torch the gunpowder room and blow up half of the old mission and thousands of attachers descending on him. Not to be outdone was Bowie, was Widmark ever better?, laid low by a cannonball, but taking out ten attackers with his seven-barrel shotgun and his ax-like Bowie knife. Travis's scene was no less impressive, out-fencing five soldiers before cut down by musket fire.The non-action scenes were incredibly dramatic. The death-of-Parson scene,only shown in the uncut 3-hour road show version that appears on TCM from time to time, has Parson thanking Davy for bringing him along on his adventures. It is very emotional no matter how many times you see it. However, the scene to end all scenes is the line-in-the-sand moment; no line, though, is drawn in the film. This is what really sets the Alamo apart from all other pretenders. It gets right what other Alamo films get wrong in its depiction, the decision to stay and fight to the death is voluntary; in other films the men are shamed or bullied into staying. In the Wayne film, each man decides on his own he will make his last stand with his friends, neighbors, and fellow Texicans, as Boone's Houston would later put it. Bowie's change of heart in that scene, deciding to fight along side his nemesis Travis rather than flee, is quite memorable. And Boone's I-hope-they-remember-the-Alamo speech was speechifying, as Leonard Maltin calls it, at its best. Remember Boone\/Sam Houston reporting to his men that the Alamo was about to fall The next time your recruits whine and belly ache, you tell them 180 of their friends, neighbors, and fellow Texicans are holed up in a mission on the Rio Bravo buying them this precious time Wow.Detractors of this classic, many Wayne haters, point out the film does not contain one historically accurate frame of film. That is correct, but who cares? The Alamo is about the legend of the Alamo. The film is not a documentary. I think one measure of greatness is whether any remake can match it. By that criteria, Wayne's Alamo is a ten, hands down. The 2004 Alamo remake proved it. The 2004 version was unwatchable and very forgettable. I just remember toward the end of the film Billy Bob Thornton's Davy warning the Mexicans after his capture, that he was a screamer and then actually screaming as they ended his life. How embarrassing and foolish. I turned off my DVD player at that point. I am told the movie went on for another thirty minutes -- why? what was the point? There was no action, no drama, no stars, no film score, and it was filmed in the dark. And the cast of thousands from the Wayne film was reduced to a cast of tens.As the Ballad of the Alamo, played at the film's end, informs, the defenders, Davy\/Wayne, Harvey\/Travis, and the others all lie asleep in the arms of the Lord.

Interesting that Frank Nitti met his demise after Capone was convicted of income tax evasion. He lasted a pretty long time in the TV show. And Jimmy Malone's statement is so true.

Jules (Demi Moore) is in banking but has money problems, probably due to her drug use. She is always getting herself in trouble and calling her friends to bale her out. Alec (Judd Nelson) works for a congressman and he is the father of the group who is always there for his friends, which you have to laugh at, the different type of character he is playing in this to The Breakfast Club shot in the same year where he played a troublemaker. He wants to marry his partner Leslie but can't stop his adulterous ways. Leslie (Ally Sheedy) loves Alec but is not sure about marrying him. (What a wise girl). Wendy (Mare Winningham) comes from a wealthy family and is under their thumb. She works at the Dept. of Human Resources. She loves Billy but doesn't have any confidence in herself. Kevin (Andrew McCarthy) writes obituaries for the newspaper but wants to be a proper journalist. He is also secretly in love with his friend's partner. Kirby (Emilio Estevez) is a waiter at a bar who wants to be a lawyer. He sees his first love Andie MacDowell and begins an obsessive love affair but she is clearly not interested. Silly woman, she is mad turning down Emilio. He tries all these different ways to woo her but in the end realises she is with someone. They go through their trials and challenges and at the end, in some cases, their lives are dramatically changed from the start of the film-Leslie decides to be on her own, Wendy gets her own apartment, Billy leaves DC to move to New York and Kirby quits his waiters job to pursue a career in Law.I have to say this isn't my favourite Brat Pack movie but it does have some good points to it. For one, although it is set in the 80's, this could apply to any teenagers at anytime who have to grow up and leave behind childhood in a way and be responsible for themselves. I can definitely relate to this as I am at that stage myself and am finding it hard to embrace all the responsibilities that goes along with adulthood.Another good thing about the film is it is not like the other fluffy, feel good movies churned out in the 80's, this doesn't have a happy ending, none of the friends find love but they do stay friends. The film deals with romantic obsession, drug use, adultery, forbidden love, unfulfilled dreams, real serious issues.

She has been garnering some pretty high profile weddings, in the San Francisco area, and turning them into beautiful and hitch-less affairs. So, when her boss (Kathy Najimy) hesitates at giving Mary a raise, the two strike a deal. If Mary can land the wedding of a wealthy socialite named Fran (Bridgette Wilson Sampras), Mary will become a partner in the business. Mary succeeds in winning over Fran and the wedding arrangements begin. Away from the job, however, Mary is gun-shy with men, preferring to spend evenings at Scrabble tournaments or watching the Antiques Road Show in her immaculate and super-organized apartment. One day, Mary's heel gets stuck in a grate as she is crossing a busy street. As she struggles to release the shoe, she does not notice that a truck is bearing down on her. But, Dr. Steve (Matthew McConaghay) does. He grabs the beautiful young woman and pulls her to safety. Later, when Mary invites him to go an outdoor movie in a lovely San Fran park, he accepts. They have a lovely evening together, one that almost ends in a kiss. Yet, each of them hesitate and the moment is gone. Soon after, Mary learns why Steve pulled back from her....he is the fiancé of go-getter Fran! Should Mary continue to plan the wedding, even though she feels drawn to handsome Steve? And, isn't he a rat anyway for flirting with another woman while counting down the days to his own wedding? This is a very nice movie, with a lovely setting and a sweet story. Lopez will never look more beautiful than she does here, for she is utterly gorgeous, from her enchanting costumes to her long, lovely hair. For those who feel the need to show off their forms in skimpy costumes, think again. One look at Lopez in a high-necked black dress and rose-colored sweater and you will realize that true beauty is elegant, and not a mere flash of flesh. J-Lo also gives a sweet performance as the lady looking for an earth-moving love. McConaghay is fine as the mixed-up groom and Wilson has her tole as a spoiled heiress down to a T. The rest of the cast is also nice. The whole production looks very attractive and eye-catching, to say the least, from the scenes in the park to a winery setting and on to Lopez' lovely apartment. If you love romantic comedies, this one should be one your top twenty list, absolutely. But, even if you think romcoms are for chicks only, take a chance with this one. You might be surprised at how much fun these movies can be, in between the required lovelorn gazes, of course.

Instead, the Batman character is more like a supporting character than anything else, the Joker, seeming to have more screen time than anyone else here. I'll just say it BATMAN is one boring superhero movie.The action scenes are very hard to see of what's going on because of the dimly lit staging, an early sign of Burton's fascination in a Gothic tone in almost 95% of his films. The story is also very uninteresting coming from my perspective. I did not feel an inch of excitement nor suspense. The only thing that kept me awake are some rather minor jokes running throughout the film which is pretty sad.Although there are many cons to this film, there are some good things, most of it, unfortunately, goes to technical aspects of the film.

For example, you don't need to watch American Beauty if you love cinema; I personally think is overrated and, although very good, only worth it because of some performances. Of course, there are also movies that you must see, nut I'm not getting into that now because these are many.However, I would like to do it rather than writing about Point Break; I'm so bored because it's just a very boring film. It's not bad though, and I need to make that clear&#133;But it's not good either. I tried to think of things that could have made it better but I found it very difficult; there are films that contain so much gibberish that you can't believe your ears.When Johnny (Keanu Reeves) goes undercover to try to find who some guys who robbed a bank disguised as ex-presidents are, a story you know by heart begins its development. The background this time is surfing, and the moral principles of the surfers are the gibberish I mentioned. These are the people that Johnny is investigating, and their leader Bodhi (Patrick Swayze) is one of those charismatic guys who are popular because of how they talk (they are convincing) but don't have a trace of sense in the ideas they profess.Bodhi's philosophy involves a fight against a 'system'. Which system? We try to understand, but we don't really know. This is a big mistake made by W. Peter Iliff; the screenwriter who thought he could put some depth into a movie that didn't show it in its simple and convenient premise. Between all the embarrassing lines of his script, Iliff gets a couple of good moments; particularly an explanation about fear given by Swayze with undeniable conviction.The rest is wind&#133;Wind blowing in the beach where the surfers unleash their adrenaline as they go angrily towards the wave and have a lot fun. Wind in the sky, as they also sky dive. All of this looks nice and tidy because Donald Peterman's cinematography is inventive, but these sequences are overly long, and tiring.Should I blame director Kathryn Bigelow? The female director, who has done a lot of movies involving cops, fails in completing the main point of any cop movie exciting action scenes. And this is the boredom I was talking about; we see bank robberies, chase scenes, fight sequences and we never feel the hype. I was sitting and my head wasn't moving or expressing a sign of excitement as bullets were going through the air and blood was all around.The edition didn't help either, establishing no connection between some scene changes. The fact that Point Break is a very popular film, does not assure that it is good, you see? Because Keanu Reeves is a popular actor but, except for the roles where he is completely calm, he is not good. Actually, he's a robot; and this film is good evidence to watch him saying his lines with the least sense of belief. He's very good at screaming and swearing, though, but he should have learned something from Patrick Swayze.I recently watched The Negotiator; it was the typical cop story, but the performances made it completely worth it. When there's two actors, they both have to be connected; and I say this because Point Break is promising and could have been more.

No, its a great movie...there is only one thing that really bothers me about this movie...its the sexual innuendo during the cooking scene. Are we to be turned on by the fact that they're stuffing a chicken? Its an obvious reference to a hand job. Its not sexy...just...GROSS. The other thing the movie has going for it is its comedy.

Just imagine how much work it takes to lift up the spirits and confidence of those who have little control over the hand they were dealt in life. Think of how the mothers, fathers, sisters, brothers, aunts, uncles and on down the line probably felt.Did it cross your mind that children may have been wounded by your shenanigans? You know how kids take everything to heart. And you know, also, that if people are hurting their children, mothers feel it too. As a child, I used to cry with frustration, embarrassment and rage that I was not able to say what I wanted to say. Mr. Mac you have single-handedly crushed thousands of people who want to be able to have people take them seriously and offer compassion as far as their disability.I've never understood why people think of this disability as a time for merriment and joviality. It hurts real bad to not be able to speak your mind. Incidentally, I also have Multiple Sclerosis; perhaps you want to do a comic routine about people who suffer with this disability too?!! Now that the Internet has made global issues real, think about all the people globally who you've offended. Celebrities have access to many, many ears and I believe that they should do so responsibly. If you are a religious man, Mr. Mac you may want to ask forgiveness for your behavior towards others in this world with you. In my opinion, that is what you need to do religiously, but socially you need to apologize to people who stutter. For example, you can reach out to schools for people with fluency problems. I feel, Mr. Mac, that you really should do this because it's like you're taking mankind one giant leap backwards.

Scorsese does a good job of keeping the tension high by blending close-up camera-work and a searing Bernard Hermann score reminiscent of Hitchcock's style. The last half hour is a little far-fetched but everything up to that point is well done and leaves you on the edge of your seat as you watch the creepy Deniro character and wonder what he's going to do next.
