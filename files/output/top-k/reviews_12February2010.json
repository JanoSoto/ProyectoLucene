Its a perfect classic and only risen why I don't give it a 10\/10 is because of the effects in the end. I hate does old school Star Wars lightning stuff. Pinhead and Butterboll is the greatest ever of maskfx. With Freddy of course close up! But still I think Pinhead is more thrilling. Hes so cam. In the new Hellraiser films Pinhead has a more deeper and cooler voice but still he looks best in the old classic.I don't hope they remake Hellraiser because that cud actually pip up the first one!!!!

It only shows him going to two colleges though.While he is ditching his high school coach of visiting the colleges that the coach wants to be hired on as a coach for that college, Johnny is visiting other colleges. Johnny finds out that the coach made a deal with a college without his knowledge, and Johnny gets back at him.

It reminds me of the time when directors made film with a love for the craft as opposed to these hacks that make films for the love of money. In this day and time you will rarely find a movie that is this fun to watch and has a good story to boot.The plot is simple enough Cliff Secord(Bill Campbell) finds a rocket in his airplane. This rocket is sought after by mobsters and a Nazi spy working undercover as an actor named Neville Sinclair(Timothy Dalton). Cliff uses the rocket to thwart Sinclair's gang.Bill Campbell is perfect as Cliff Secord. He's headstrong but still immensely likable. Jennifer Connelly is great as his girlfriend Jenny Blake and Alan Arkin gives a strong performance as Cliff's mentor but wise best friend Peevy. Timothy Dalton gives one of his best performances to date as Neville Sinclair. Neville Sinclair is a great villain without being over-the-top with it. I've always like Timothy Dalton as an actor even when he played James Bond. Paul Sorvino's role as the mobster Eddie Valentine shouldn't go unnoticed either.The thing I like most about The Rocketeer is that its a fun movie. Watching Cliff test the rocket for the first time remains in my mind in a place so snug. The director respects the time period(1930s) without contradicting it(like a few directors that do period pieces tend to do). In short its a blast from the 90s that is more enjoyable than the overrated dross that is out now. Its definitely worth a second look.Before I leave I will say this do not take directors like Joe Johnston for granted or you will be responsible for the onslaught of Follywood hacks. I've seen Joe Johnston's whole catalog of films and have yet to find one stinker among them. He's earned my trust and how many directors can you say that about? Not many. In conclusion support directors that respect the art of film-making or you will be sorry when all that is left are the hacks. Think about it.

It's as if they were making a film for people too dumb to want any plot! The plot, such as it is, is about some smart disabled guy who is using his über-brain to tie into all the world computers and mess with people--killing them in various ways that are super-graphics intensive. And, of course, it's up to a bunch of kids (and a down-and-out Patrick Bergen who must have been desperate for work) to save everyone. Is this really the best they could do?!

What if you awoke from such a dream, started going about your daily business, and then realized that *this* was the dream and the nightmare you thought you woke up from was your real life? How terrifying would that be? Jacob Singer is living such a life. He's back home from Vietnam, settled in with a hot girlfriend, and has a mundane job at the post office. He's a smart fellow (his Army mates gave him the nickname The Professor because he earned a doctorate but never did anything with it).But Jacob has inner demons that cause turmoil in his life. He's divorced from his wife, but still feels a connection. And he has to deal with the painful memories of one of his young children, who was killed prior to Jacob leaving for Vietnam. And his memory of a particular event in Vietnam that he can't explain and still haunts him.But what Jacob has to face now is that these inner demons have shown themselves to be real (at least, to him), and are tormenting him. He goes to see his regular VA counselor, only to be told there is no record of such a doctor and no file for Jacob ever having been there. He sees strange things out of the corner of his eye that he can't explain. When he realizes that his platoon mates are experiencing a similar nightmarish existence, they go to a lawyer who checks out their story and tells them they were never even in Vietnam. They were all discharged on psycho grounds after going nutso on a training exercise.Jacob becomes convinced that they were all part of some sort of Army experiment that did something to them, but he can't explain what because the things he is experiencing have no explanation. Were they all part of some Manchurian Candidate group hypnosis experience? Guinea pigs in chemical warfare testing? Is Jacob truly going crazy? Or, is it an example of I'm not paranoid if they really are coming to get me?Jacob's Ladder is a frightfully effective film of a man who may or may not be losing his sanity. Robbins is perfect as the quiet, introspective, amiable fellow who is at the end of his rope and has nowhere to turn. Director Lyne does a great job keeping the horror in the shadows; playing with your mind's ability to extrapolate and fill in a scene. The film works much better as a subtle exercise in psychological horror, as evidenced from a few more explicit scenes wisely cut from the film (but available on the DVD.) Even so, there are images so frightening that you will probably jump a couple of times. And replay them in your head while trying to sleep later. (Good luck.).The film works best if you go in cold.

It even explains that the Stigmata wounds suffered by the woman could be iconic, or symbolic, yet she does physically suffer the wounds. For instance, Leprosy was known to be a disease caused by spiritual possession. As for the cuts and gashes, not sure I believe in those. However, I do believe that a person can lose blood if possessed by an unholy spirit, or perhaps the holy spirit as well. For example, one can become anemic and lose a pint of blood every few days, without cuts or gashes. Blood can just vanish inside the body.This movie makes you think a lot, especially about the 6th gospel and it's hard to figure out why Jesus didn't have a gospel in the Holy Bible. Its something that a devout Christian like me wonders about often. But like the priest in the movie says, the closer you get the God, the more pain The acting was great in this film by the entire cast, both supporting actors and main cast.

He has an ex-wife(played by a younger Meryl Streep)is a lesbian and is writing a book about their marriage. And Isaac has a crush on his best friend's girlfriend(played by Diane Keaton). Who at first he doesn't like and then grows onto her.Allen's character is a bad person. But he plays his usual goofy self so he's likable. You don't get that much from Diane Keaton as you did in Annie Hall. But the film's plot and everything is better than Annie Hall, which I still thought was an excellent film.

In being given more to do, Burton essentially produces a film that is of a higher quality; doubly able to deliver on fronts of character as well as pay close enough attention to the power struggle going on within the place its set, as corrupt business'; faux politicians and sociopathic civilian inhabitants of Gotham City seem to vie with one another under the careful watch of the film's lonely, somewhat socially inept, billionaire protagonist Bruce Wayne, alá Batman.The film will see a variety of characters, three of which are bound in not only their power struggle but also by way of having their names linked to the animal kingdom, interact and form respective bonds as the future of a bustling city hangs in the balance. Two of the film's four central characters are monsters, one a slick and handsome business tycoon named Max Shreck (Walken) with the other a foul, thrice-decade sewer inhabitant named The Penguin (De Vito). This, as the two that complete the quartet struggle with their own issues of violent mask and costume-clad alter-egos which clash with quiet, lonesome and restrained 'by day' personas in Michael Keaton's Bruce Wayne\/Batman and Michelle Pfeiffer's Selina Kyle\/Catwoman.The film begins with a grandeur and quiet frightening opening, that of a disfigured baby being born and consequently disposed of by the parents, a nasty sequence in which they head out into Gotham City park in the dead of night avoiding contact with other parents of newborns and tossing the kid over a bridge into a canal. As we watch it float down the various waterways which lead to the sewers, the camera lingers on this baby's cot as we observe it through long pipes and steel barred drain entrances as it drifts, seemingly harmlessly, down the rivers of the city and into the sewers. We are given time to ponder to ourselves what foul, household cat eating beast lies inside. When get a first glimpse of the creature in its adult years, it is by way of an expressionistic shadow, furthering a sense of the uncanny.Indeed, many years later Max Shreck sits in a conference room delivering a talk to some of his business cohorts. His business, simply entitled 'Shreck's', has its HQ based in a high-rise building amidst the others, looming ominously over Gotham; his company's logo on the very top, spinning around and around insinuating the power in the numerous directions the company has in the holding of its power over the city. This, as models of the same logo lie strewn around other Shreck infused buildings.

Upon being present during Shreck's talk, she attempts to join in with the suit-clad, ego driven businessmen in making a suggestion but is promptly put back in her place with a cruel put-down from Shreck plus a statement which enforces her domesticisation, despite her shortcomings, in that she makes a Hell of a cup of coffee. Kyle maintains a seemingly odd relationship with her mother by way of the messages she leaves on her answering machine, while the numerous stuffed animals and child's toys scattered around her room maintain the odd aura. When a chance event leads her back to Shreck's office, she accidentally dominates her surroundings by way of ingenuity in cracking Shreck's password to some top secret files; files that reveal acts of a criminal nature &#x96; the consequent punishment for this act of attempting to 'become big' within the office environment is death, instigated by Shreck. Essentially, an event that tips her over the edge and by way of some alley cats; the uncanny rejecting of her previous image as well as a little black magic; becomes the powerful and somewhat man hating creature of Catwoman.The Penguin, in setting up a false rescue of the mayor's child, ascends to the surface with Shreck as his companion when a blackmail plan arises. What you flush, Penguin flaunts &#x96; an idea of things coming back to haunt you when you don't rid your life of them correctly. Despite having this pointed out to him, Shreck makes a similar mistake by only assuming Kyle to be dead when he attempts to kill her, only for her to return and cause chaos. Penguin embarks on a mayoral campaign after winning over the city as this myth becomes reality, but while everyone is fooled, Wayne isn't and there's a superb scene in which Penguin goads Batman for having a direct approach in conversation despite hiding beneath a mask &#x96; there's a moment of realisation when Batman makes it known he's guessed what Penguin's up to, and that he too has a mask on in the sense he isn't the person he says he is, despite, again, the direct approach in reaching out to all the inhabitants of the city. The film's blending of character with a distinct sense of dread as these power-mad people threaten to consume an already bleak looking world actually comes across as quite interesting as certain images of a disturbing nature and individual scenes of menace keep it grounded from reaching too far out to children.

Now comes the second installment in George Lucas's prequel trilogy to the epic narrative that broke box office records and set standards for generations to come. The second movie detailing the past of Darth Vader, Star Wars Episode II - Attack of the Clones is a little bit better, but that's not quite enough to make it a recommendable movie. It's close, but not quite. If it only they had thrown out Jar-Jar Binks (yes, I still cringe every time I think of that bumbling, frog-like freak), patched up some mediocre dialogue, reworked this sappy love story, and captured a better sense of the magic that we require for a Star Wars movie, it would have worked.In this one, Anakin Skywalker is grown up to a young Jedi and played by Hayden Christianson. Since Qui-Gon's dead, he is being taught by Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor). While Obi-Wan's out fighting evil, Anakin begins a forbidden romance with Padme (Natalie Portman) and of course, well, trouble begins and lasers are blasting and...yeah....Now, I have nothing against a love story. Some of my all-time favorite movies are love stories. But I require two things a good story and a conviction that the lovers are in deed, in love. I got neither of those from this. The 'romance' between Christianson and Portman is very shallow with utterly ridiculous and hammy dialogue such as to me, you will always be that little boy on Tatooine. Thus, in the end, this subplot is boring, tiresome, and sappy. Not a good combination and not what we want to see in any element of a Star Wars movie. I thought Jack Lloyd was not a very good young Anakin Skywalker in The Phantom Menace and Hayden Christianson is awkward and wasted here in a miscast role. Again, with this, we need to have that daunting feeling that Anakin, young, innocent, and loyal to the Jedi will one day betray them and become a cold-blooded killer. We don't get that feeling. Because the original narrative and this new one don't seem to be related beyond plot. The original trilogy was artistic, imaginative, and realized good characters and stories. This new one is just like a hokey video game.Unfortunately, the screenplay entire is crippled by bad dialogue and unnecessary characters. However, I am not going to trash on this movie too much, because I must admit, it was very close for me. There was more of an adventurous sense to the picture, which was absent in The Phantom Menace, and I really enjoyed some parts including a scene where Anakin, Padme, and Obi-Wan have to fight with three alien monsters in a ring very much like the gladiatorial fights of Ancient Rome. And thankfully, Jar-Jar Binks has a much smaller part in this picture. That's always a relief. Overall, it's not too bad of a picture. It's tolerable, but it doesn't quite deserve to bear the words Star Wars in its title. Thankfully, by the third prequel, Revenge of the Sith, things would improve.

Thus, in the end, this subplot is boring, tiresome, and sappy. Not a good combination and not what we want to see in any element of a Star Wars movie. I thought Jack Lloyd was not a very good young Anakin Skywalker in The Phantom Menace and Hayden Christianson is awkward and wasted here in a miscast role. Again, with this, we need to have that daunting feeling that Anakin, young, innocent, and loyal to the Jedi will one day betray them and become a cold-blooded killer. We don't get that feeling. Because the original narrative and this new one don't seem to be related beyond plot. The original trilogy was artistic, imaginative, and realized good characters and stories. This new one is just like a hokey video game.Unfortunately, the screenplay entire is crippled by bad dialogue and unnecessary characters. However, I am not going to trash on this movie too much, because I must admit, it was very close for me. There was more of an adventurous sense to the picture, which was absent in The Phantom Menace, and I really enjoyed some parts including a scene where Anakin, Padme, and Obi-Wan have to fight with three alien monsters in a ring very much like the gladiatorial fights of Ancient Rome. And thankfully, Jar-Jar Binks has a much smaller part in this picture. That's always a relief. Overall, it's not too bad of a picture. It's tolerable, but it doesn't quite deserve to bear the words Star Wars in its title. Thankfully, by the third prequel, Revenge of the Sith, things would improve.

It's only Louise Fletcher who didn't amuse me, giving a one-note sullen face all along. The thing about Jon Lovitz is that he's Jon Lovitz in every movie or TV show.

It is the fourth (or first, in saga chronology order and according to its title) Star Wars movie and the starting entry of a prequel trilogy fully written and directed by Star Wars creator George Lucas. Now the original trilogy, need I say it, is composed of three of the most original science-fiction movies ever made and two of the best films ever made. That trilogy is over. The prequels' point is to tell the story of Darth Vader, how he became one of the screen's most detestable villains. The whole trilogy is a disappointment, but The Phantom Menace is the worst of the bunch. Lucas decided to transform the series from a powerful, story-packed narrative to basically a chaste videogamy extravaganza...poorly-written, to add another fault.The Phantom Menace traces Anakin Skywalker back to when he was a kid, when he was found by a Jedi master named Qui-Gon (Liam Neeson) and a young Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) who take it under their wing, after having the kid race against aliens in a pod in one of the movie's most pointless scenes, to raise him into a Jedi warrior. Amidst the conflict, there is an intergalactic battle amongst various alien races and humans were bizarre and unsightly makeup designs, and all mixed in with one of the most annoying supporting characters this amateur film critic has ever seen.There are many things that do not work in this movie. Shall I name a few? The screenplay is awful. Jar-Jar Binks. Characterization is at the level of a cheap video game narrative. Jar-Jar Binks. The CGI special effects are overdone to the point where they look phony. Jar-Jar Binks. The movie is packed with pointless scenes such as that ridiculous and boring pod race I mentioned earlier. Oh, and did I mention Jar-Jar Binks? Jar-Jar Binks is a fully-animated alien addition to the cast, whose animation looks phony, and resembles a cross between a dog, a cobra, and a fish. And whose voice, done by Ahmed Best, with his alternative form of speech (he says meesah instead of me or I) drives even the mentally toughest of us bonkers. The character never shuts up and is so obnoxious and irritating that he brings the already dull movie to a screeching halt whenever he opens his physically big mouth, which is, frequently over the course of the entire picture. He's supposed to be a bumbling, Three Stooges-like character who is stupid but makes you laugh, but is stupid and makes you cringe.Well, Jar-Jar Binks aside, though his inclusion to the cast was the most detrimental mistake in the picture, there are so many other flaws. The special effects are only special in detail, but they are so overdone and so often with CGI that even they begin to lose credibility and persuasiveness. The other trilogy used great effects with imagination. Here, they are just used like objectives in a video game. Yoda is again realized via a puppet controlled by Frank Oz, but this puppet looks less convincing and passable than the original. The dialogue in this picture is just dreadful, also treated like a video game. There's a point where Natalie Portman and others are surrounded by bad guys and she tells her comrades to give up and that the bad guys have won this round. Give me a break. We also have a mincemeat of performances. Liam Neeson is great, as always, but his character is flat. Natalie Portman, a great actress, doesn't seem to have much to do but stand around and look pretty, which she does well, but doesn't get to show her genuine talent much. And Jake Lloyd (sorry to pick on a young actor) is rather mediocre and annoying as a young Anakin Skywalker, who screams in an irksome manner Yippee! every time he's happy. And there's another fault. This movie is supposed to be about the history of Darth Vader. Well, then we should have the feeling that this kid, this boy, will one day become one of the cinema's most chilling bad guys. And we don't get that feeling. Not once. Need I go back to Jar-Jar Binks? There's also a new villain called Darth Maul, who makes me laugh more than he chills me. But one absolutely commendable performance is that by Ewan McGregor as a young Obi-Wan Kenobi. His acting is the only thing that captures magic of the original narrative. McGregor studied the acting style of Alec Guinness to portray this character and he does a stupendous job. He reminds me of a young Alec Guinness and the performances he gave before the original picture.Instead of capturing the spirit and feeling and power of the original trilogy, The Phantom Menace and its two followers just reduced the series into a videogamey style with annoying dialogue, poor characterization, and very few fine moments. The other two are better considerably, but this start to a new trilogy is a real disappointment.
