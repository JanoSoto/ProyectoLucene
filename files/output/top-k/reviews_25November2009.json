Still, the fact that this got made at all back in 1988 is amazing. This was years before Will & Grace or Queer As Folk. It came and went quickly but it should be rediscovered. The script is sharp and (for the most part) the acting is excellent. It deals realistically with a gay man trying to deal with family, love, men and relationships in the 1970s--but I think any gay man from any era could find plenty to identify with here. Fierstein is excellent in his Tony Award winning role. His voice is a little hard to take at first but you get used to it. Kerwin seems a bit too earnest as Ed but he's still pretty good. Broderick seems nervous too but he pulls off the role of Alan (although seeing him falling all over Fierstein IS pushing credibility). As a point of interest Broderick played David in the original stage version and said it helped his career quite a bit. Young is very good in her small role as Laurel and so is Ken Page in his small role as Murray. Bancroft is WAY over the top as Arnold's mother (but it fits the role) and Castrodad does what he can with his severely edited role as David. However his first meeting with Bancroft is hilarious.

Those classics have good casts, intelligent scripts, and higher production values.

Many of them think their loved ones aren't real but are emotionless impostors. At first, Miles believes a local psychiatrist's explanation that everyone is suffering from mass hysteria. Miles and his old flame Becky Driscoll (Dana Wynter) eventually find that real people are being replicated by soulless imitations while they sleep, courtesy of alien seed pods. After a capture, an escape (during which Becky is overtaken by the aliens), and another escape, Miles runs to a busy highway where he is ignored by drivers as he shouts, They're here already! You're next! then the film fades to black.The studio insisted that director Don Siegel add a prologue and epilogue with doctors (played by Richard Deacon and Whit Bissell) who uncover the crisis and notify authorities. While some purists hate the added scenes, I think they add a sense of hope to an otherwise very bleak ending. However, it's your choice regarding the added footage, of course.Kevin McCarthy (who is still acting at age 95) and Wynter are superb leads in this scary, scary film. The best performance is probably given by Larry Gates, who excels in his role as a lying, conniving local doctor who has been taken in by the alien pods and does everything to entrap Miles and Peggy.

It's a black comedy, the sort of which probably won't make you laugh but may make you smile. The actors are all very good, including a very young Jerry Mathers. Shirley Maclaine is hot in her Peter Pan hair-do, but her acting is merely adequate. The other actors are much better and John Forythe's soothing voice puts you at ease. He reminded me of a suave, light 'n' airy version of Bogie. This was the first collaboration with composer Bernard Hermann, and his score is exceptional, especially during the more tense moments and near the beginning. I wouldn't be surprised if Danny Elfman listed Hermann as one of his inspirations.As you have probably already learned, the trouble with Harry is that he's dead. Or, rather, not so much that he is dead but how he died and why. Several individuals in the main cast have encountered him and believed their actions may have directly or indirectly killed Harry. What follows is multiple burials and exhumations by the potential murderers, each curious to inspect the body to see if the truth can be revealed upon inspection of his corpse. The most amusing aspect about the situation to viewers will be that even for those people who don't know Harry's identity initially, being in the presence of a dead body doesn't seem to unnerve anyone. It almost seems to be the least of their worries(a disturbing analogy that seems frighteningly fitting in today's world with some of the morons society has raised in this new generation).This film plays out like a Vermont travelogue most of the time with some marvelous autumn colors and vast rolling hills surrounding a quaint cozy town(of killers).

If you are a fan of Hitch, you will probably dig it, though it likely won't be among your favorites in his film library.

Shirley Maclaine is hot in her Peter Pan hair-do, but her acting is merely adequate. The other actors are much better and John Forythe's soothing voice puts you at ease. He reminded me of a suave, light 'n' airy version of Bogie. This was the first collaboration with composer Bernard Hermann, and his score is exceptional, especially during the more tense moments and near the beginning. I wouldn't be surprised if Danny Elfman listed Hermann as one of his inspirations.As you have probably already learned, the trouble with Harry is that he's dead. Or, rather, not so much that he is dead but how he died and why. Several individuals in the main cast have encountered him and believed their actions may have directly or indirectly killed Harry. What follows is multiple burials and exhumations by the potential murderers, each curious to inspect the body to see if the truth can be revealed upon inspection of his corpse. The most amusing aspect about the situation to viewers will be that even for those people who don't know Harry's identity initially, being in the presence of a dead body doesn't seem to unnerve anyone. It almost seems to be the least of their worries(a disturbing analogy that seems frighteningly fitting in today's world with some of the morons society has raised in this new generation).This film plays out like a Vermont travelogue most of the time with some marvelous autumn colors and vast rolling hills surrounding a quaint cozy town(of killers). This film did poorly upon release and hadn't been available for quite a long time. If you are a fan of Hitch, you will probably dig it, though it likely won't be among your favorites in his film library. If you aren't a fan of The Man, then you might feel the plot is a little thin, the repeated burial sequences might be viewed as film filler. However, the dialogue is very good overall, and, considering the time the film was produced, there is some very frank dialogue, especially discussing Miss Gravely and her implied 50, er, 42 year old virginity. Oddly enough, I find spinsters hot.Get your shovel.

What Dreams May Come is a wonderful and dramatic tragedy and drama. Certainly in my top 10 out of thousands seen.It presents a plausible after life spirit existence without being dogmatic. Particularly wonderful for me was that Katie the dalmatian appears in heaven also. Really love Robin Williams nice guy movies and he is spectacular in this. Also really liked Good Morning Vietnam and especially Dead Poet's Society because his excellent characters in those are presenting positive and meaningful views of life. Captain, My Captain! is just wonderful in the context of Dead Poets. Anabella Sciorra is perfect in her role in this. Cuba Gooding, Jr. is eminently likable in this too. Max Von Sydow fits in perfectly too!Annie has every right to give up and commit suicide, blaming herself for the kids' deaths and later blaming herself for Chris's death too. The love that they have for each other and their children is very inspiring. Chris's sadness over pushing his son too hard is also very touching.What is most inspiring of all is when Chris finds Annie in hell, he loves her so much that he is willing to lose his mind and soul to stay there with her. How many people are fortunate enough to love like this?The scenery in Painted heaven is exquisite beyond words. The interplay between heaven and earth is very cool. The appearance of spirits differently than on earth is fascinating too. This is by far the foremost afterlife movie ever made. If you liked Heaven Can Wait and\/or A Matter of Life and Death and\/or Made in Heaven and\/or The Bishop's Wife then run, don't walk to rent this divinely beautiful film. Also, the soundtrack by Michael Kamen is far and away the most beautiful film music I've ever heard out of thousands. It is out of production and expensive but worth it. It's just amazing the wondrous feeling that it invokes. With all the misery and ugly shat in this world caused by humans, this soundtrack will convince you for a time that all is beautiful. Wow! 1000 out of 10 for this magnificent creation!

The movie is highly entertaining with a solid storyline and some amazing cinematography. This is a controversial masterpiece, and, in a way groundbreaking, thought provoking and downright intelligent. You see a spectacle of absurd dialogue's, interesting costumes, gaudy sets and some bold images. Kubrick's on screen depiction a female body is disdainful, cold, cheap, and impersonal. The scenes portraying nudity are unaesthetically done but that goes with the the feel of the film. Although the film opens on a very strong note it tends to drag a bit in the second half. The fight scenes thou foolish are thoroughly entertaining. The movie raises a very important issue that a man ceases to be a man due to his inability to make a choice and is driven by suicidal tendencies. The term clockwork orange is some kind of a compound metaphor. It means something organic(free) has been converted to a controllable and an inorganic process. The experiment that Alex undergoes carves out clockwork oranges out of human beings such that they have no decision making ability and are forced to act in a some predetermined way no matter what the circumstances. We have seen many movies that glorify violence where we are love with a protagonist who kills for fun. But never was I repulsed by a film portraying violence. This movie showed that nothing good ever comes due to violence but the condition deteriorates further into evil.

This is a movie full of everyday objects that create a palpable air of menace and threat by simply sitting there as conduits for the titular seer.

It bears many resemblances to the old-fashioned fairytale. Villains, a fairy godmother, the triumph of good over evil, and a moral. The moral is 'There's no place like home'. Think about the political environment in 1997. It's not unlike what it is now. Those of you who have had a brush with the law, or a battle with big business, will recognize the plot. Twelve years on, The Castle is as relevant to-day as it was in 1997. Think about another great fairytale. Like The Wizard of Oz. And the final few words 'There's no place like home'. The Castle is the archetypal 'home'. It's worth fighting for, not because it is a building, but because it represents family. The Wizard of Oz is worth watching over and over for its political agenda. Each viewing of The Castle will reveal new insights into current political, social, and economic truths. Ordinary people with ordinary concerns are powerless, until some whistleblower or dedicated person takes up the sword of justice. I confess to saying in 1997 'Amusing, funny, but not a great film'. The Castle is stupendously popular because it is a great film.

With that out of the way it will come as no surprise that I really like this movie. I also think that this movie has stood the test of time well. So much of this movie suits Burton especially it's Gothic setting making for a marvellously dark and moody setting with just a touch of comic book. It was brave of Burton to do away with the typical comic book back story and tale of origin that normally hangs like a mile stone around he neck of most super hero franchise initial instalments. Instead we get a much better slow release of Bruce Wayne's back story. Michael Keaton is great as Wayne \/ Batman though inevitably he completely upstaged by Jack Nicholson's tour de force performance as the Joker. Yes this performance had now been superseded by the awesome performance of the late Heath Ledger. This Joker really is a different beast. Nicholson dominates every scene he is in almost getting the hero treatment from Burton. As shown in the scene where Batman battles the Joker from his air craft. Missing with numerous shots whilst I just takes the Joker one shot to take Batman's air craft down. My only gripes with the movie ar Burton's weakness at shooting action sequences (they feel to much like choreographed clown sequences). Also Kim Bassinger dos not really work for me as Vicky Vale. But then weight that against the rest of the great movie which especially works in the symmetry of Jack \/ the Joker creating the Batman and the Batman in turn creating the Joker. This added to the legend Prince submitting th soundtrack makes this a classic to be enjoyed time and time again.

There's definitely little elements of The Thing, The Fly, Blade Runner and most of all - Invasion of the Body Snatchers - in this so if you like any of those, give this a go.

Jake Gylenhaal gives a haunting performance as Donny who's basically a spoilt snotty nosed rich kid who its hard to have sympathy for(his Dad buys him a moped as a punishment?)but despite this, Gylenhaal plays the character more sensitively than written so its easier for the audience to connect.Again you could say this film is open to interpetation, in lots of areas and you may need a second or third viewing etc, but just the one will do me.

It was a time in my life when I was alienated from everyone else because of the music I liked, because I didn't listen to what was considered hip and cool. Thanks to the influence of my parents, I listened to mostly classic rock; bands like, Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, & Yes. A time when my age group listened to Linkin Park, Limp Bizkit, Creed, & Eminem; music that I felt no connection with emotionally, music that didn't appeal to me as a teenager, or even a human being, it was a life changing experience for me to see a movie that featured and paid tribute to the music that I liked. It felt like coming home to somewhere that I never knew. The soundtrack was top notch, hearing cuts by some of my favorite bands; Yes, Led Zeppelin, Todd Rundgren, The Who, The Allman Brothers Band, and also helped turn me on to Rod Stewart, Joni Mitchell, Elton John, The Seeds, Thunderclap Newman, The Beach Boys, and Simon & Garfunkel (surprisingly, I had heard Yes's version of America long before I heard Simon & Garfunkel's original, and I was absolutely floored when I first heard it in this film). I loved Nancy Wilson's acoustic baroque-folk-rockesque score. The instrumental bits held up against the classic songs perfectly. I was a bit annoyed when only 1 short piece of the score ended up being released on the soundtrack album, but beggars can't be choosers. If you don't already have the music featured in this film in your collection, I highly recommend buying the soundtrack album, and then going out and buying the original albums by all of the bands on the soundtrack, because every artist on this soundtrack is worth more than 1 song. (In the case of Nancy Wilson, I recommend Heart's 70's albums and the Elizabethtown score.)Although, this film does have one shortcoming. Kate Hudson. She's not a bad actress. In fact, I still attest that this is her best film and film performance, to date. But the slew of bad films and terrible performances that she's done since 'Almost Famous', in a way, hurts her performance in this film, retroactively.The biggest part of this film that I connected with was the character William Miller (played by Patrick Fugit). His shortcomings, the disrespect from his peers at school, his naivety, his overbearing mother. These were all problems that were put into perspective real quick after seeing this film. Everybody, at one time or another, went through what I was going through, and here's good a lesson presented in a way that appeals to me. Of course, I wish that I could've been there to experience it first hand in the late 60's-early 70's, but then again, as Robin Williams once said, If you remember the 60's, you weren't there. Being born in 1987, I don't remember the 60's. Maybe I was there. Who knows? Either way, at least I have the music and this film as tributes to that great era of counterculture to look back on, and hopefully I, and all of us who appreciate the music, can take the music and the lessons of that era with us in the decades and centuries to come.Oh, and I do recommend that everybody seek out the Untitled version of the DVD.

The Game is an underrated movie which in contrast, according to some audiences overrated. Besides very smart plot, the things make the movie an excellent masterpiece are Fincher's story telling, music causes mystery, atmosphere and Michael Douglas. I believe that it is an easy role may be, but Douglas seems the best choice for this role. After watching the final scene, every detail, every dialog, every event require re-interpreting. One of the best twists so far. Even just the relationship between Nicholas and Christine makes the movie enigmatic. Is Christine a femme fatale who then decides to help him? Is she a femme fatale pretends to be a good girl? or Is she a bait? Another point, Fincher reflects Van Orton's nightmarish situation perfectly also with a very stylish direction. Unbelievably, some people say that it is a plain story, the movie's theme is know the value of life. This is just an interpretation and no need to say that it is much more than that. Let's remember It's a Wonderful Life. The Game and that film are extremely different from each other, but the thing I try to say is that if we look from this point of view, the movie's theme is the same, know the value of life, in spite of the challenges, don't give up etc. but does this simple theme make the movie weak? It's a Wonderful Life is a great movie. Therefore, as said, the very consistent script, the plot, Fincher's story telling and direction, the very successful atmosphere, music and Douglas's persona make the film great and Sean Penn is our bonus.

Therefore, as said, the very consistent script, the plot, Fincher's story telling and direction, the very successful atmosphere, music and Douglas's persona make the film great and Sean Penn is our bonus. I like the final and cannot see any wrong or simple point. When I watched it first in 1997, the reaction in the final made me seriously bothered, that's why a lot of people dislike the movie, they say it ruins the movie, but I don't see it as a flaw or call it a bad ending, if you ask me, it was a bit frustrating. It is just like if I was him, I would not do what he does. The Game is one of the movies of my life.

We do a lot of things together-we're twins. He was having some gender identity issues at the time (he is straight but was having a recurring series of dreams about becoming a woman) so we went to see this movie as a way of seeing how drag queens\/crossdressers\/etc. function. The movie was interesting from beginning to end. Seeing the three principal characters getting dressed and going to the contest was fun in itself. Seeing how they landed in a rural Nebraska town and stirring up the local womenfolk was even more interesting. I don't want to spoil any plot developments but I can say that my\/our father would've been upset over not ENOUGH pepper being in the sauce! The film comes to a nice resolution and conclusion and we both came out of the theater with some idea of how he wanted to deal with the issue. He figured if all that work went into being a drag queen\/transvestite he should just work through it and out of it (actually, when we got home he tried on some of my clothes, shoes, wig, etc. and he looked absolutely ridiculous...he hasn't done this since...I hope!). Back to the movie...it was a lot of fun and, at the same time, thought provoking. There are men that do this for an alternative lifestyle and they're comfortable with it. The aftermath-that the Academy Awards ignored Patrick Swayze for Best Actor, John Leguizamo for Best Supporting Actor, any of the ensemble cast for Best Supporting Actor\/Actress or any of the technical people (Makeup, Costume Design, Visual Effects, etc.) shows that the Academy Awards often look the other way (at least Swayze got a Golden Globe nomination). Again, this movie was very thought provoking as well as being entertaining. I give a nine.

","genre":"Comedy, Drama"},{"date":"25 November 2009","score":"5 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" Roger Ebert described it well. The effects of abuse are similar to implanted medication. It continues to seethe inside the victim long after the original event or implantation. Nick Nolte stars as Wade Whitehouse, a shell of a man about to lose everything he has and knows, including his sanity, due just as much to his inability to learn to function as a person outside of the abusive environment he grew up in as his overbearing father's alcoholic stupors and redneck machismo. Nolte's mumbling has been criticized as indecipherable hogwash, but it's consistent with a person who has lost direction, confidence in himself, and his reason for being long ago. James Coburn plays Glen Whitehouse, Nolte's father, winning the best supporting actor Oscar for his mind-blowing portrayal of an abusive father who has simply played the same record over and over and over for many many years. Coburn's acting is a rare treat; in that, every action, gesture, nuance, and word of dialog coming out of his mouth makes up a portrait of abuse hanging in an imaginary gallery of contempt. Ironically, Wade and Glen share the name Whitehouse, which of course symbolizes purity, goodness, and an idyllic existence all rolled into one but in reality is everything but that. Nolte's character is a small town sheriff with nothing much to do except plow snow and double as a school crossing guard until a hunting accident occurs and uncovers a possible financial conspiracy. Meanwhile, Nolte must deal with fighting his ex-wife (Mary Beth Hurt) for custody of his daughter who has either been programmed by Hurt against Nolte or has other reasons for disliking him. Every aspect of and social interaction in Nolte's life reduces him to nothingness, whether he tries to buy his daughter a hamburger, plead with his ex-wife (Hurt), give a person a ticket for a moving violation, interact with his best friend or his boss, or has cross words with his father (Coburn). There is not the slightest hint of success in Nolte's past, present, or future, except for the possibility of his current relationship with his new waitress girlfriend played by Sissy Spacek. Watching Nolte's life unfold layer by layer, it's no surprise to viewers when Spacek bails on Nolte as well. Director Paul Schrader wrote the script based on the novel by Russell Banks, and as in every good Schrader film, the acting and the dialog are outstanding. There is never a false note or Hollywood moment. Willem Dafoe, who previously starred in Schrader's earlier best effort Light Sleeper, plays Nolte's younger brother Rolfe who distanced himself emotionally and physically from this quagmire of a family years ago. So much so that Dafoe's ill-advised opinion regarding the hunting accident serves as the catalyst leading to a sequence of events, culminating in Nolte's Pyrrhic victory at the end. It's clear Dafoe's character did not know just how deep or how long Nolte's abuse was festering inside when Dafoe says at least I was never afflicted by that man's (Coburn) violence. Nolte's character replies with that's what you think with a laugh and a tone of voice that makes it clear Wade Whitehouse has never been so sure of anything else ever before.Schrader sets the film in New Hampshire (although it was filmed in Quebec) during a snowy winter and features several shots of bleak landscapes and dimly lit night scenes, the perfect complements to a script depicting one man's small world of despair and desolation closing in and trapping him like an unexpected winter storm. The script's dialog is balanced with fantastic scenes during which the characters reveal much by doing only a little at times. The flashback scenes showing Coburn interacting with his son(s) are like home movies in the Bizarro world; Nolte recalling a family life and memories not worth the effort but always there nevertheless. Sissy Spacek, as Nolte's waitress girlfriend, has a scene at Coburn's house with Nolte present, and she rolls up and tightens her hands in her face, realizing immediately what Nolte took a lifetime to do, if even then. Nolte's toothache throughout the film and how he ultimately chooses to deal with it serves as a metaphor for Schrader's exposure of Nolte's festering rage and his inability to appropriately express anger. He turns to violence, just as his father (Coburn) did, to assert himself, combat his feelings of inadequacy, and to solve his problems. Abuse and violence begets abuse and violence. The film does not necessarily lead to any great redemption, resolution, or revelation. Instead, it builds quietly and slowly telling a story that many viewers are probably familiar with themselves, whether they share the similarity of alcoholic loved ones, a lack of success in their work or personal lives, or just shattered lives. It tells a story of how a man regresses from using his wits to his primitive instincts in order to survive emotionally. It's an interpersonal tragedy, and viewers with unflinching sunny dispositions may not identify with it at all. Viewers have complained about the film being too depressing, pointless, and a waste of their time, so liking the film a lot may be a matter of taste and tolerance, or it may just be that some viewers are unable to accept films without a happy or satisfying ending before the fadeout. ***1\/2 of 4 stars.
