Some people just shouldn't go to comedy films. There's a lot to love about this film. It ain't a masterpiece but it mixes some subtle humour and fart gags. The characters are likable and played straight in a delightful world where the Disco Boys roll. This film is now available at next to nothing in supermarkets, go for it.God gave me a gift. I shovel well. I shovel very well.

In fact I would have to say it is one of my favorite Steve Martin movies if not the number one film in my book. Which this is a bit of a strange occurrence as I usually do not care for comedies that last as long as this film did as this one nearly clocked in at two hours long. The gist of the film has a local con man in a small town in France I think conning woman after woman getting them to give him money and such. He lives in a very nice home and he is very well established in the area. Unfortunately, he hears that a very famous con man is coming to the area, known as the Jackal. Well he runs into Steve Martin's character and thinks he is in fact the Jackal and proceeds to try and get rid of him any way possible. Martin's character wants to stay in the area though as this town seems ripe with rich women willing to part with their money and give it to a guy who has a good con. At a certain point Caine's character seems to try to take Martin's character under his wings and teach him the techniques that he has learned over the years. This is just another way to get rid of Martin's character and very funny scenes ensue as Caine gets Martin to act like a very demented brother so he can get certain ladies to break up with him. The end has the two dueling to see who can stay in the area while the loser must leave they pick a lady whom they are supposed to con and get her money. A great scene involving Martin and a wheelchair and Caine posing as a doctor occurs during this stretch. It also ended very funny and unexpectedly for me. The movie on a whole was very funny and very well acted, maybe a couple of minutes of time taken off and such. Also, I was a bit disappointed as a kid when the movie did not feature the scene in the trailers where Martin's character pushed a lady into a river, but that may have made the con man a bit to dark.
