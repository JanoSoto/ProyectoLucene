This movie has all the elements needed for an epic film characters that get us involved in the story, a wonderfully dramatic score, fantastic technological achievements, and a real-life tragedy that tugs at our heartstrings.Some people feel that the love story between Rose and Jack detracts from the real story of Titanic. I, however, think that it greatly adds to it. By following these two characters and their brief, yet passionate, love affair, we get more involved in the story, so when the ship finally sinks, it is all the more heartbreaking when we see so many people meet their tragic end. And the love story isn't the only reason we feel so moved; when the ship is sinking, the various scenes of the doomed third class passengers break your heart as well. Among other things, as the ship sinks we see a mother singing her children to sleep, an elderly couple lying together in bed, and people desperately trying to get in the boats or jumping off the ends of the ship; all these scenes made me cry. I actually found myself in tears through almost the entire second half of the movie. Though the real sinking is terrible in itself, this film emotionally moves us because we actually know people on the ship, making this movie succeed where other films about Titanic have failed.Not only is the plot moving, but the technological achievements in this film are ahead of its time. James Cameron was able to realistically recreate the sinking of Titanic, and it is absolutely astonishing. He is able to add amazing detail that had me utterly transfixed throughout the entire movie. James Horner's score for the film is also spectacular. It is haunting and wonderfully dramatic, and completely suits the film.I never saw Titanic while it was in theaters, as I was under 13 and my parents had this rule about not seeing PG-13 movies until I was 13. In fact, I didn't see Titanic until a couple days ago, when it was on TV, and even then I only saw the last half of the movie. But that half had me so transfixed that I drove over to Target right away to buy the DVD, because I just HAD to see the entire thing. And I am very glad I did. Titanic truly is a timeless movie, because even though it came out 8 years ago, I absolutely fell in love with it. It is now one of my favorite movies ever.Titanic is the kind of movie that people either love or hate, and to give the haters some credit, this movie does have its faults. The acting is shaky at parts and some scenes and lines are a bit cheesy. All movies have their shortcomings and Titanic is no exception. But in the end, none of that matters. The good points far outweigh the bad, making Titanic one of the greatest films of all time.

Yet, western movies are the favourite pastime for many like me. The extraordinary skills of the cow boys in handling fire arms, their dress and style, horse riding and gunfighting in amazing locations always thrill us. ' We think you are the man we can trust' &#150; not only the innocent villagers but also the viewers think of the great actor Yul Brynner. In the very first scene we are impressed by a fighter for justice. The inherent leadership qualities of Yul Brynner add to his acting skills. All the characters in the movie simply obey this born leader. He is a perfect specimen for a real leader. His eyes are so powerful that no one could even look at. I have seen this movie for the first time in 1962 in India. Oh my God ! How many times in how many places I have seen this movie later. Now I have my own DVD and that gives me a feeling that all those magnificent heroes are always with me at home. Simple story, true to life characters, excellent music and brilliant direction have made this movie an unforgettable one. The beginning of friendship between Yul Brynner and Steve McQueen when they join hands for a noble cause and their sustained team spirit even in risky situations strengthen the scenario. The villain Eli Wallach is the perfect opponent for Yul Brynner. He lives not acts, an arrogant, crooked, ruthless and a clever villain every one is scared of. The way he justifies his unlawful life style is quite different. When he comes to know that his Privileges are refused in the village protected by unexpected gunmen, his inimitable expressions frighten everyone. The building up of the seven men team, each member a champion gunslinger is an exciting outset. The knife thrower James Coburn, woodcutter Charles Bronson and all the other team members enter with a distinct and interesting introduction and prove that they are really magnificent. The performance of Vladimir Sokoloff, the wise old peasant is outstanding. His facial expressions in response to the amusive lecture by Horst Bucholz is superb. Each time I view this movie, I wait for this particular scene to pay special attention and admire his acting skills. It is hard to believe that this is the first movie for Horst Bucholz. With a highly suitable character, he wins the hearts of all the viewers just like that. It is interesting to learn that, clapping hands as fast as one can is a brilliant technique to assess how fast a fast gunner is. Not only the innocent villagers in the movie but also the vower's are happy at the end for having seen a good movie in all aspects. It is a great success for Director John Sturges and his unit for making a movie to remain a favourite for many movie lovers even after 45 years even in far off countries.

You have been warned.* (It's actually been a while since I've seen this movie, but I neglected to vote or comment on it at the time. Since I'll be doing so for Episode III, I figured I might as well do this one first as a point of reference.) I will admit up front that I am often a fickle, difficult-to-please movie viewer. I am more than happy to nitpick a film to death, no matter how good it actually is. (In fact, my nitpicking a movie is no reflection on how I felt about it, as even my favorite movies are full of things to critique.) Having said that, I will say that I am not going to nitpick this movie. At least, not here. I've done it elsewhere online, and there's nothing I can say here that hasn't been repeated ad nauseum by others before me.Like a lot of Star Wars fans, I much prefer the original trilogy over the prequels. The originals may have had stilted dialogue (as some claim), but it was at least entertaining stilted dialogue. The stilted dialogue in these movies is merely informative at best, mind-numbing at worst.However, Episode II is a vast improvement over the insipid dreck of Episode I. No pidgin English, no cutesy children (unless you count the younglings, which I half expected to see in a Fox cartoon spin-off), and no misguided comic relief in the form of Jar-Jar (though he does have a rather atrocious role in this film, however brief. One could argue his responsibility in the decline of the Old Republic.) In fact, I would have rated this movie higher (perhaps a 7 or 8), had it not been for the unconvincing romance scenes between Anakin and Padme. (Okay, so I lied about not nitpicking.) Anakin had some of the worst pick-up lines in the galaxy, yet Padme seems to just eat them up.And I don't know about you, but having learned that my boyfriend has just slaughtered an entire village does not encourage thoughts of marriage in my mind. (Not that I have a boyfriend, much less a homicidal one.) Yoda's moves were cool, but it seemed rather misplaced for his character. (And yes, judge him by his size, I do.) He apparently lost a lot of spunk in the course of 20 or so years. (And yes, most people do, but most people are't doing backflips at the age of... what, 850 at least?) And the whole separatist\/trade federation plot angle continues to confuse me (even in the third movie). Not that I don't follow it; just that I don't see much point to it. I realize it's meant as a catalyst for Palpatine's plans, but it's a rather lame catalyst, in my unhumble opinion.Other than that, I liked the movie a bit, but it still lacked the laid-back charm of the originals. It left me with little hope for the third prequel, which I knew would have no room to be laid back.(For best results, hope for eye candy only, with some storyline thrown in.)

You have been warned.* (It's actually been a while since I've seen this movie, but I neglected to vote or comment on it at the time. Since I'll be doing so for Episode III, I figured I might as well do this one first as a point of reference.) I will admit up front that I am often a fickle, difficult-to-please movie viewer. I am more than happy to nitpick a film to death, no matter how good it actually is. (In fact, my nitpicking a movie is no reflection on how I felt about it, as even my favorite movies are full of things to critique.) Having said that, I will say that I am not going to nitpick this movie. At least, not here. I've done it elsewhere online, and there's nothing I can say here that hasn't been repeated ad nauseum by others before me.Like a lot of Star Wars fans, I much prefer the original trilogy over the prequels. The originals may have had stilted dialogue (as some claim), but it was at least entertaining stilted dialogue. The stilted dialogue in these movies is merely informative at best, mind-numbing at worst.However, Episode II is a vast improvement over the insipid dreck of Episode I. No pidgin English, no cutesy children (unless you count the younglings, which I half expected to see in a Fox cartoon spin-off), and no misguided comic relief in the form of Jar-Jar (though he does have a rather atrocious role in this film, however brief. One could argue his responsibility in the decline of the Old Republic.) In fact, I would have rated this movie higher (perhaps a 7 or 8), had it not been for the unconvincing romance scenes between Anakin and Padme. (Okay, so I lied about not nitpicking.) Anakin had some of the worst pick-up lines in the galaxy, yet Padme seems to just eat them up.And I don't know about you, but having learned that my boyfriend has just slaughtered an entire village does not encourage thoughts of marriage in my mind.

By the time the cast came off my arm, summer was gone.But I have always admired the X-games types and surfers especially. I think I spent the first month after I moved to Southern California on the beaches and piers watching the surfers, bemoaning that fact that I had missed my calling. It's the sort of thing you should learn young, before the horrible senses of self-preservation and self-awareness burrow in. Or else at best, you'll be so worried about not getting hurt or laughed at, you'll wind up looking like a trained bear.I always admired how a good surfer seems to not care about anything but that moment, that wave, that experience. At one with the forces of nature. A good surfer makes it look like there is nothing else but that wave right there, and the way you interact with it. There's a lot of Zen in it to me.This documentary outlines how a few young folks took the surfing concepts and extended them to skateboarding. Ramps, downgrades, low sweeping curves while interacting with the cement waves beneath their feet. In their day and time, this was all new. radical. Prior to the Zephyr Skate team the idea apparently was to go as fast as you could in a straight line on a skateboard, hence my long Evel Knievel at Caesers Palace like tumble down the front walk.This film is a look back through time, to an America before EVERYTHING was labeled, tagged, marketed, and jam-forced down our throats as Extreme.

Piper Perabo kick-started her movie career with her leading role, later being cast in the family favorite, Cheaper by the Dozen. Adam Garcia was at his very cutest in this film. A couple of years after the film was released, he appeared in Riding in Cars with Boys, playing a forgettable role for anyone not a die-hard fan of his acting. In this film, however, he and his charming Australian accent shine undeniably as the boy-toy of Piper Perabo's character. This film also launched the costars into stardom, and even the actual bar Coyote Ugly, which is located about an hour away from my hometown.As the old saying goes, you should never judge a book by its cover. This film may appear to be targeting a predominantly male audience, but it is also a brilliant blend of coming-of-age wisdom, family crisis, and romantic drama. It presents all aspects of Jersey girl Violet Sanford's life and journey to stardom with smart humor and inopportune situations.

Featuring a few timeless songs on its intelligently varied soundtrack, it creates a vibe with absolutely nothing to criticize.This being one of my favorite movies of all time and featuring my favorite song of all time, I am quite convinced that this movie was created flawlessly and would appeal to all audiences, but I tend to be very opinionated. However, if you are looking for a movie that you can watch with your friends OR your spouse on any given weekend, I would highly recommend giving Coyote Ugly a try. Recognizing some of your favorite actors of the present will undoubtedly be only half the fun.

It is an intelligent and honest film about men in war; no heroics, no jingoism, no evil enemy, just regular Joes who are caught up in something big and deadly and would rather be home, but are doing their job. There are no clichés, no obligatory guy from Brooklyn, no high sounding phrases, no patriotic slogans, just an honest and realistic depiction of strictly ordinary guys caught in war. Lewis Milestone, the director, obviously understood the combat soldier.I love the dialog, the banter among the men of a fighting platoon, especially that between Pvts Rivera, played by Richard Conte, and Friedman, played by George Tyne. Coincidentally, Dana Andrews, one of my favorite actors, character is Sgt. Tyne. I wonder what was made of that by actor George Tyne. The cast also includes a young Lloyd Bridges and Huntz Hall, in the only roll I can recall seeing him in outside the East Side Kids\/ Bowery Boys films.The novel by Harry Brown, from which the film was made, was republished a few years ago and the dialog in the film is lifted straight out of it, which is part of what makes the film so great. In fact, this is one of those rare cases where the movie follows the book faithfully, almost to the letter.I was nine years old when this film was released and I well remember the night I first saw it. My parents, who have just celebrated their 70th wedding anniversary, thought it was a romance film. I didn't want to go but when we arrived at the old Westmore Theater, now long gone, which was in walking distance of our home, and I saw the lobby photos and saw it was a war film, I was the one delighted. There was always at least one scene from these films that stayed in my mind over the years and in this one it was the hand of the German soldier with the ring on it hanging out of the wrecked armored vehicle, and the assault on the farmhouse.It was just a little walk in the warm Italian sun, but it wasn't an easy thing.An excellent film made from an excellent novel with an excellent cast, all making an excellent viewing experience.

Ray Peterson (Tom Hanks), his wife Carol (Carrie Fisher) & their young son Dave (Cory Danziger) live there & about a month ago a mysterious family called the Klopek's moved next door to Ray & his family. No one in the street knows anything about the Klopek's, not even how many of them there are. The Klopek's are strange neighbour's, they've never introduced themselves, they don't take care of the house, the garden is full of weeds & dead trees, bizarre lights & noises emanate from their basement, they dig holes in their back-garden at night during rainstorms, Ray's dog Vince digs up what looks like a human thigh bone from their back-garden & they even manage to act suspiciously merely taking out the rubbish. While on vacation for the entire week Ray's friends Art Weingartner (Rick Ducommun) & Mark Rumsfield (Bruce Dern) being to fill Ray's head with story's which almost overnight seem all too plausible as Walter Seznick (Gale Gordon) an elderly resident suddenly disappears without trace, the loony trio suspect the Klopek's of everything from murder to satanism. Seeing what's going on Ray's & Marks wives Carrol & Bonnie (Wendy Schaal) decide to put an end to the spying & speculation by going round to the Klopek's & introducing themselves to their strange neighbour's, but things don't go as the ladies had planned as Ray & Mark leave even more convinced of the Klopek's guilt, they just need to find out guilty of what exactly...Directed by Joe Dante I love The 'Burbs, I've seen it quite a few times & never tire of it. Dante manages to keep things moving & really pile on the paranoia as the film progresses without giving too much away & he creates some great scenes which contain both comedy & tension. The well thought-out script by Dana Olsen is almost perfect, it's interesting & entertaining, it feels refreshingly different, it moves along at a great pace & is never boring or dull. I love the idea of Hanks being the normal sceptical guy who manages to twist ordinary situations into something sinister as his idiot friends put crazy ideas into his head. The use of paranoia is excellent throughout as we find out what's going on as Hanks does, by the time The 'Burbs finished I was thinking up lots of crazy solutions & scenario's as well! All the characters are fun & likable which helps immensely to just become lost in their crazy world. I also thought The 'Burbs was an incredibly funny film throughout, the dialogue is littered with some absolutely terrific one-liners & is just entertaining to listen too. I love the scene when they introduce themselves to the Klopek's for the first time, the way they all just sit in a really awkward silence as Reuben (Brother Theodore) stares menacingly at Hanks, Hanks eventually breaking the silence by talking about drainage. Or when Hans (Courtney Gains) offers him a raw sardine which Carrol makes him eat. There are many, many more examples of great individual scenes & sequences throughout The 'Burbs which had me quite literary laughing out loud & it's not often a film makes me do that these day's. There is a definite dark streak running through The 'Burbs, it has some cool creepy horror elements & tries to make us think about who the strange one's really are, the people who don't conform to a certain way of living & society in general or the people who persecute them because of it. I just love the way The 'Burbs is constructed & how it all builds up to a slightly over-the-top & somewhat silly ending which is the weakest part of The 'Burbs but still works & is a satisfying enough way to round the film off I suppose. There is no real gore in The 'Burbs but there is are brief sequences from The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 (1986) & The Exorcist (1973) as Hanks imagination is fuelled even more by late night horror films on T.V. which we catch a few shots of, there are a few human skulls as well. There's a fair bit of swearing & language too so I'm not sure it's suitable for all the family. The acting is great from everyone, Hanks is brilliant as the hero & really likable as the ordinary man living a boring life in suburbia who lets his imagination run riot, Cory Feldman makes an appearance as Ricky Butler one of the neighbour's & surprisingly even he is good in it, a great cast for a great film. On the negative side The 'Burbs is a little bit silly at times & one or two of the characters were a bit annoying on occasion, but these are small quibbles generally speaking considering The 'Burbs is just such good, funny entertainment. Technically The 'Burbs is strong with a great atmospheric Church organ sounding main theme by Jerry Goldsmith, good photography, editing, special effects & production values. Overall I love The 'Burbs, it's fantastic fun that I never seem to tire of. Highly recommended as something a bit different, quite thought provoking at times with a great speech by Hanks at the end & all that's left for me to say is watch it as soon as you can!

His real intent was to share his ideas with people.Andy Kaufman was the biggest mystery of our world, and he took his real thoughts with him to his grave without telling everyone truly about himself. This movie tells about his extraordinary life... Andy Kaufman was 35 years old when a rare form of lung cancer killed him on the 16th of May in 1984, so he couldn't finish his mission. This film was created to remind people of this strange man who wanted to push the limits of reality.Jim Carrey's performance in Man on the moon really is stunning. He could give us the feeling that Andy just came back to tell his own life. Some people says that during the film they got the feeling Andy haven't died in reality, he just did the biggest joke in his life he made his own biography movie. Well yes, this would be a real Andy joke. He was curious about human reactions, I wonder if he's laughing somewhere right now thinking how nicely he could fool us. Maybe this film is not so entertaining for somebody who haven't a clue who was Andy Kaufman, or rather for somebody who just can't understand his peculiar slant of life, but it's full of thought-provoking ideas about human mind. Andy thought in a totally different way than people usually do, and that's what makes the whole story interesting. It drives you to get more information about him.

This movie tells about his extraordinary life... Andy Kaufman was 35 years old when a rare form of lung cancer killed him on the 16th of May in 1984, so he couldn't finish his mission. This film was created to remind people of this strange man who wanted to push the limits of reality.Jim Carrey's performance in Man on the moon really is stunning. He could give us the feeling that Andy just came back to tell his own life. Some people says that during the film they got the feeling Andy haven't died in reality, he just did the biggest joke in his life he made his own biography movie. Well yes, this would be a real Andy joke. He was curious about human reactions, I wonder if he's laughing somewhere right now thinking how nicely he could fool us. Maybe this film is not so entertaining for somebody who haven't a clue who was Andy Kaufman, or rather for somebody who just can't understand his peculiar slant of life, but it's full of thought-provoking ideas about human mind. Andy thought in a totally different way than people usually do, and that's what makes the whole story interesting. It drives you to get more information about him. Because he was special, just as special as this film is.If you're not in the mood that you would want to think about the mysteries of human mind, about Andy Kaufman's unusual mind, then don't watch this film. Don't misunderstand, you must see this movie, but only if you feel like it. Then it's sure that you will like it.

Today now they sometimes use too much computer animation, and it takes away from a film. This is truly animation at it's best, the kind that would take hours to make one frame. And the animals, young and old, were life like, and adorable. I live in the forest, so I was really in awe of how real it was! I did cry though when Bambi's mom died, and at the end. I know that some animals rely on the mate then never see each other again, but it was so sad, because you could feel the love between Bambi and Felien, and then the dad couldn't ever be with his kids, or his wife, forever! I cried, and I hardly ever cry. This is one of, no the best Disney movie ever made. It had me glued to the TV for the whole hour and a half. I just wish I had seen it sooner, I'd already gone through my childhood before I saw this movie. I'm definitely buying the special edition DVD soon!

And the whole thing is about a priest's conscience. Does he keep his vows even at the cost of his own freedom and maybe his life, certainly his reputation.That is what Montgomery Clift is faced with. German actor O.E. Hasse who Clift worked with on The Big Lift is the caretaker of a church where Clift is assigned. He takes the priest's garments and commits murder in them. And then offers confession to Clift. Clift knows the murder victim as well and could have his own reason for doing him harm. Of course police detective Karl Malden suspects him.How this all gets resolved is the plot of the story. But let me give you a hint. The title of the original story is Our Two Consciences. And the consciences referred to are Monty Clift's and someone else's.Clift and the rest of the cast do a fine job in this minor Alfred Hitchcock film. But the acting honors in this go to O.E. Hasse, an really oily malevolent villain who is enjoying the predicament he's put the priest in. You won't forget him.Fans of Hitchcock and Clift will be entertained and others will enjoy it as well.
