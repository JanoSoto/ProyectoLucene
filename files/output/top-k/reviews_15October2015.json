It left me in shock and awe. It has got one of the best tension build-ups ever put on film and some very artistic, not to say operatic violence that functions as mini-climaxes after each build up of tension. It even has a few shocks that made me jump a bit and made my heart skip a beat. In one of the beginning scenes with Goblin's famous (or maybe notorious?) music, it builds up such an intense tension that my whole body got tense. I am in no way in bad shape, but I could feel my stomach aching a teeny, tiny bit after the movie. It was astonishing. It took me whole 15 minutes to get over the shock of the first 10 minutes of the movie. I mean, I have seen all of Dario Argento's thriller and horror movies from 1970 to 1990, I just didn't think he would start 'Suspiria' that way. Which is good! I understand that not everybody thinks 'Suspiria' is a horror masterpiece, some have called it noisy trash, some will say it's too slow, some complain about the lack of explanation to elements of the movie (like the maggots scene), some will also complain the script is bad since it doesn't spoon feed its audience with the answers. But that is how Argento makes movies, that is why I love his movies. He leaves certain things unexplained, which is great for a movie geek like me. I like to analyze and occupy my mind with movies I love, it helps me relax. But I gotta say, big names have mentioned 'Suspiria' as one of the all time greatest and one of the scariest horror movies ever made (For example John Carpenter and Alice Cooper).Anyway, the noisy soundtrack is supposed to unsettle its audience and not embrace them. It is supposed to psyche us out, make us tense and make us beg to make it stop. In my opinion, although with some quite simple music it is quite effective. I didn't expect to get that much tension from the movie and its music. Which was a horrifyingly awesome surprise. This is by the way an atmospheric horror movie, so don't expect slasher killings. This is like a child's nightmare, a fairy tale but for adults. By the way, the script is actually well-thought out unlike what many people might think. Argento spends a lot of energy writing his scripts, but he never really get recognition for that since many audience members call his scripts bad because he doesn't spoon feed his audience. Unlike many American and Blockbuster movies. That's what makes movies like 'Suspiria' great. It is not only a horror movie with a director who does what he wants, it is an Art-House horror movie with beautiful cinematography and beautiful colors and an operatic violence, that quite simply leaves me in awe. (Don't think that I enjoy violence, I am actually disgusted by it but my unhealthy fascination with it is bigger) Also it is like a fairy tale, but for adults. If you take away the grizzly murders, it does in some ways remind of 'Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs', even some of Hans Christian Andersen's fairy tales. Which I absolutely love.

Aladdin was the perfect film for this and took a very different approach for the studio, but they didn't forget what had made the previous few films so successful. It took an old-fashioned, solidly set-up story and gave it a much more modern feel with broader humour. You'd think that this would clash, yet it works brilliantly and gives the film a unique edge. It's a fine balancing act and I'm not sure many other Disney films could have carried it off, but this is one where nearly everything tried works no matter how madcap it may be. The film focuses on street urchin Aladdin and the princess Jasmine, both being fed-up with their lives and wishing for something else. After a chance meeting with the princess, Aladdin is roped into finding a lamp for sorcerer Jafar only to keep it and unleash a Genie that gives him three wishes which he uses to try to win over Jasmine. At its core it's a story about two people wanting different things and connecting because of that, just with a lot of comedy and many obstacles put in their way. It's nothing complicated, yet it's a storyline that people can easily get behind and they want to see the arc that both people go through. The romance takes up most of it, but enough time is given to develop Jafar and even the Genie's own dilemma.Aladdin and Jasmine aren't the most interesting characters, but they are very likable and as a result always keep your interest. Aladdin is street smart and Jasmine is adventurous, but both are very warm and easy to like individuals. The Genie is what most people remember and he kind of is the star here. Most of that is down to Robin Williams, whose witty improvisations and mile-a-minute comedic stylings are just brilliant here. Genie is just such a fun character as a result, with a numerous jokes of all kinds and he makes pop culture references that are genuinely funny. The Sultan is enjoyably absent-minded, while the characters that don't talk like Aladdin's monkey Abu and the Magic Carpet do provide some funny moments.Another positive is the villain and Jafar is just fantastic. His menacing design looks great, he manages the difficult task of being sinister whilst also having subtle comedic moments and Jonathan Freeman's eloquently dark voice works to perfection. Not only that but his motivations make sense and his grudge towards Aladdin is set-up excellently. Gilbert Gottfried as his Parrott Iago also offers some good laughs. The animation is truly outstanding. I picture a lot of beautiful reds and golds when I think of this film, it is always very visually appealing and the landscape designs just look lovely. The animation on the Genie is very impressive just by how fast it is and a lot of the movements here flow well despite the rapid speed most of it goes at. It also lends itself to some very effective tense moments, I think the climax in general is superb.The music is very good. All the songs here have very catchy melodies and are memorable, from the serene 'A Whole New World' to the energetic 'Friend Like Me'. None of them get in the way of story and the work well with the animation. The romance impressed me as well because there was a believable bond between Aladdin and Jasmine, they do have chemistry and you do get drawn into their struggle. There are some clichés hanging over some areas, but I don't think they affect things too much. As said the comedy is very modern and filled with pop culture references. Some people might fine this distracting, but like I said I think it gives a different twist on the formula.On the whole I'm a big fan of Aladdin. The ways and means by which they tell this story are very out of the box, but I think that is a big part of its appeal. This is a fresh take on a story that could have been quite dull and as a result is does place it aside as something very different for the studio. As said I really liked the main characters, I thought Jafar was an excellent villain and Robin Williams is simply a whirlwind of comedy. The animation is as impressive as ever and I don't think there is a song here that isn't at least good. I'd have to say that this is easily one of Disney's most entertaining pieces.

What made this movie stand out (at the time) is this is one of the first horror movies to kick up the horror and nudity.This has created one of the biggest slasher movie franchises to date, but it all started here and it did not have Jason Voorhees as the killer. All though this movie started off as a rip-off of the Halloween but it seems to have at least tries to establish itself as its own movie and I think it does just that. This movie starts off in Camp Crystal lake in 1958 as a P.O.V of the killer hiding out in the main cabin in the camp. The killer murders two camp counsellors that have gone into the cabin to have sex. The film then skips to 1980 where the camps new owner Steve Christy is trying to reopen the camp after decades of trouble. Steve hires 7 new counsellors and they spend half the movie preparing the camp for the summer. Then an unknown killer shows up and starts killing people. This film features the usual slasher movie characters, but I find that these character are all pretty enjoyable to watch and none of them are too annoying. The main problem with this movies characters are that most of them are just forgettable. The main character in the film Alice (Adrienne King) is very clearly based on Laurie Strode from Halloween and has no notable personally quirks. The character that is worth mentioning is Mrs.Voorhees (Betsy Palmer) as she has one of the best slasher villain motivations of all time. Funny enough, when Betsy Palmer looked at the script for the movie she said it was a piece of crap but, when she saw that the amount of money she would be paid would be enough for a new car she accepted Sean Cunningham's offer to be in the film.Another character I feel should be mentioned is crazy Ralph. This guy is actually hilarious and might have started the crazy guy warns people awaycliché.The film is shot alright and taking inspiration from Jaws only plays the theme when the killer is present. I notice in this film that there is a lot of continuous shots of the characters and I find that this is a nice thing to see as most films you see nowadays is just cut cut.

What made this movie stand out (at the time) is this is one of the first horror movies to kick up the horror and nudity.This has created one of the biggest slasher movie franchises to date, but it all started here and it did not have Jason Voorhees as the killer. All though this movie started off as a rip-off of the Halloween but it seems to have at least tries to establish itself as its own movie and I think it does just that. This movie starts off in Camp Crystal lake in 1958 as a P.O.V of the killer hiding out in the main cabin in the camp. The killer murders two camp counsellors that have gone into the cabin to have sex. The film then skips to 1980 where the camps new owner Steve Christy is trying to reopen the camp after decades of trouble. Steve hires 7 new counsellors and they spend half the movie preparing the camp for the summer. Then an unknown killer shows up and starts killing people. This film features the usual slasher movie characters, but I find that these character are all pretty enjoyable to watch and none of them are too annoying. The main problem with this movies characters are that most of them are just forgettable. The main character in the film Alice (Adrienne King) is very clearly based on Laurie Strode from Halloween and has no notable personally quirks. The character that is worth mentioning is Mrs.Voorhees (Betsy Palmer) as she has one of the best slasher villain motivations of all time. Funny enough, when Betsy Palmer looked at the script for the movie she said it was a piece of crap but, when she saw that the amount of money she would be paid would be enough for a new car she accepted Sean Cunningham's offer to be in the film.Another character I feel should be mentioned is crazy Ralph. This guy is actually hilarious and might have started the crazy guy warns people awaycliché.The film is shot alright and taking inspiration from Jaws only plays the theme when the killer is present. I notice in this film that there is a lot of continuous shots of the characters and I find that this is a nice thing to see as most films you see nowadays is just cut cut.

Sure it is exaggerated and simplistic, sure it is just another Rambo set in the future and a far away planet instead of a forest or jungle. As a kid, I watched it mainly for the action and Kurt Russell. I thought Kurt Russell was mesmerizing as Todd and I could really relate to his character. Nowadays it is mostly for its theme and still Kurt Russell that I watch the movie. (I'll get deeper into the theme). There is lots of action, but on the more naivé and simplistic side. With a Rambo-like character that can take on a whole army without getting a scratch, standard stuff for your average action movie. But although with the simple premise and approach, I still feel interest in this movie. It is not a groundbreaking movie. It is not the most well made movie, but it doesn't take itself too seriously, which is good. With a subtle and convincing performance of Kurt Russell.Now to the real reason why I like this movie the theme. The theme has been explored many times before but I still find it interesting in this movie. The theme is dehumanization, it has been explored better and deeper, like in Stanley Kubrick's 'Full Metal Jacket'. Also 'Full Metal Jacket' has a much more punching power than this movie. But in 'Soldier' it was quite touching with Todd's character development (Although I like Joker's character development better) and its exploration to its theme. Whilst in 'Full Metal Jacket', we get to see the consequences of dehumanization and its effects on mankind in the end, in 'Soldier' we head in the other direction where our main character begin to act more human and regain his humanity. Kind of like the other side of the coin. But I honestly prefer 'Full Metal Jacket', I feel it is more honest. But 'Soldier' is still an above average action movie even though it is quite simplistic. I honestly feel this movie is worth watching over and over again. Oh, also Kurt Russell doesn't spend half of his time on-screen spitting out cheesy one-liners like you would normally get in its genre, which I quite like.I give the movie 7\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"15 October 2015","score":"","review":" I still enjoy this movie.

One thing appealed to me was the dialogue. You can learn some good English writing from them.

Lily was a tragic figure at her time. She was not equipped to do cruel things to others. She thought to act upon. However, she was never able to bring herself to do it. The dreadful situation to her was over thinking. She also fell in love with a subtle playboy which might be more perilous to her than a flamboyant one. She looked for love in the meantime also the security. The ideal match rarely goes together even nowadays. Nonetheless, we are reluctant to blame her for her own destiny.

I really enjoyed the theme of energy being continuous and how the film portrays people and the manner in which they think translates itself into the energy they give off and ultimately the very way they act. I thought the film had a real honesty about it as throughout the film Powder sees people for who they really are and thus allows us to see these people in the same light. While watching the film, there were 2 scenes however that i did find quite unusual. I will talk about them shortly. After watching the film I then logged onto IMDb to rate the film a 9 for what i thought was a beautiful and original film. It was then that i came across the fact that the director had been convicted of child molestation and served time for it. My perception of the film suddenly changed. Suddenly, i did not view the film as beautiful and honest. I now thought that perhaps the director made a film to create his own fantasy - a film about a complex, genius and misunderstood young man which the world will not accept who just need to be loved and accepted for who he is. The 1st scene that surprised me was the one where Jeff Goldblum connects with the the boy and strokes his face and head. Thinking about this now, the actions of the teacher might to some seem good-natured, however the actions are also wrapped with a tinge of sinisterness. It makes us wonder about Goldblum's character as he gives the impression that he may want to use or manipulate the boy. The 2nd scene that i questioned was where Powder is caught staring at a boy rinsing himself off in front of the mirror. The other boys see this and jump to the conclusion that Powder is not only strange but also homosexual. The film wants us to believe that Powder was staring in this fashion because he sees the long flowing hair that he does not have and realizes how different he is. I would argue that the way the scene is shot does not lend to this assumption as Powder really stares for a long time and someone of his intellect should know better to stare at a half-naked boy only covered by a towel. I felt compelled to write a review because i find it interesting that my perception of the film changed drastically the second i found out that the director was gay and had molested a young boy. Maybe it is unfair of me to change my perception of the film because of this fact and probably my perception of the film should not be influenced by this fact. But it is what it is and that's what i really find interesting about this film. Is it wrong for my perception of the film to be changed just because the director has a history of child molestation?

You can't really beat the feeling of seeing something in a theater and that is enhanced even more so when viewing a classic like Goodfellas. The crowd was completely into it from the opening...constantly laughing at certain scenes they knew were coming and even making a few comments here and there about how certain characters were acting. Pretty cool.A lot of the performances stood out more to me as well this time. Of course the obvious ones are still great (Liotta, Pesci, De Niro & Bracco) but a couple that stood out to me even more on this viewing were Paul Sorvino as Paulie and Christopher Serrone as young Henry. It's actually kind of a shame that Serrone didn't go on to have a good career in Hollywood after this film because he proved he had the chops to be in the ring with the big dogs at only 13 years old. And Sorvino's 2nd to last scene with Liotta in the restaurant where Liotta is apologizing to Paulie should have been enough to get Sorvino an Oscar nomination. The full range of emotions he conveys in that scene with just his eyes is unbelievable.There were actually a few scenes throughout that I don't remember ever seeing before...which is kinda weird since I've seen the movie at least 10 times now.

Fantastic acting, tons of gore, little bits of humor sprinkled throughout, and a certain scene involving a severed head and a girl that just could never be shown in a movie these days. I loved all of it. The movie follows the story of Dan Cain, a medical student who is also in the tough position of dating the dean's daughter. Cain is soon joined by the strange Hubert West, a medical student from Switzerland, who has a serum that can bring the dead to life.The script is wonderfully written, with just the perfect amount of dark humor to lighten the mood just a little bit, but don't get me wrong this movie definitely had a dark tone even with it. I definitely have to give a shout out to the special effects department. A talking severed head, walking burn victims, and a zombie cat. Which all hold up to modern times CGI. With just some fake blood and some quick camera work they made a wonderful Dr. Hill. Another part of the movie that I really liked was the fact that I cared about the characters. In many horror\/zombie movies I don't care if or when a character dies, because I don't feel a real attachment to them. The acting is what turned this around, the acting was impressive in every way. They allowed me to really get to know the characters and develop a sort of relationship with that you really don't find in movies of the same genre. The Re-Animator was also straight and to the point. With a run time of only 86 minutes there was plenty of time for action and little to none filler scenes. And boy will that ending keep you wondering what just happened??? Overall The Re-Animator easily gets a 10\/10, it was just perfect in every way. Funny, scary, and gory. Modern day directors should look back at movies like this as an industry standard.

Fantastic acting, tons of gore, little bits of humor sprinkled throughout, and a certain scene involving a severed head and a girl that just could never be shown in a movie these days. I loved all of it. The movie follows the story of Dan Cain, a medical student who is also in the tough position of dating the dean's daughter. Cain is soon joined by the strange Hubert West, a medical student from Switzerland, who has a serum that can bring the dead to life.The script is wonderfully written, with just the perfect amount of dark humor to lighten the mood just a little bit, but don't get me wrong this movie definitely had a dark tone even with it. I definitely have to give a shout out to the special effects department. A talking severed head, walking burn victims, and a zombie cat. Which all hold up to modern times CGI. With just some fake blood and some quick camera work they made a wonderful Dr. Hill. Another part of the movie that I really liked was the fact that I cared about the characters. In many horror\/zombie movies I don't care if or when a character dies, because I don't feel a real attachment to them. The acting is what turned this around, the acting was impressive in every way.

I just simply can't imagine another actor do what Jim Carrey did in this movie. I find it impossible to find another actor who can imitate him and still not overact. Jim Carrey was unbelievably enough a natural. There is a comedian in Greenland who imitate Jim Carrey, but he is just simply silly and not fun. Some Greenlanders even refer to him as The Greenlandic Jim Carrey.But anyway, it is such a silly comedy that it can get unbearable to watch sometimes where it borders on just being silly instead of fun. But Jim Carrey made the movie fun. Courteney Cox was good too, but she was kind of overshadowed by Jim Carrey in this movie.

I know a lot of people hate this sequel to an original classic film Escape From New York (1981) even my friend does not like it. I love it, I thought is the last good action sequel that Kurt Russell did. Still predecessor Is far superior than this film but I still love it. Because of Kurt Russell and his performance, Stacy Keach Is also good in it. Snake on a surf board is awesome. Escape from L.A. is a bad ass underrated sequel. I love it and I don't care what anyone else is saying it. Draw. His best line.After sixteen years, Snake Plissken is back. A long overdue vacation if you ask me.Escape from L.A. starts off with the new America. After a devastating earthquake, L.A. is now an island on the coast of America. After a new president takes over, L.A. becomes a deportation point to take out the trash. However, after being apprehended, Snake is forced to go to L.A. The setup beforehand is nice. The interaction with Snake and the local authorities is good stuff. Snake has his mission. The look of the new L.A. is quite something. The land is destroyed, the chaos is frequent, and the locals are quite lethal and always watching their backs. Makes sense. This is not going to be easy.Kurt Russell is great as Snake. He admits that Snake is one of his favorite characters to play. He had fun here. The plot works. Would make perfect sense if this did happen. Cliff Robertson is cold and calculating as the president. The action is fun. The look of the movie is perfect. L.A. looked like a wasteland. Be on the lookout for an appearance by Bruce Campbell. He has a small, but memorable role here.The plot Snake Plissken is once again called in by the United States government to recover a potential doomsday device from Los Angeles, now an autonomous island where undesirables are deported.Escape From L.A. isn't the greatest sequel ever made but it is my favorite follow up to a cult classic film Escape From New York (1981) but it is a still a good sequel cause the action scenes are kind of good. I love Action films and this is an Action film and I don't care about the haters of this film. In my opinion is the last good Action film from the 90's.

(1996) is very good underrated hated film from the 90's. Even you can see Hollywood in flames in this movie the same scene was used in Demolition Man (1993) In the beginning of that movie.

Escape From New York (1981) Is also one of my favorite classic Action Sci-Fi John Carpenter movies. It was also the first movie I ever saw from John Carpenter as a child and It I still the best movie in my opinion. I love this movie to death I own it on Blu-ray tough it doesn't have great video quality like it should have I still love it to death. Kurt Russell is Snake Plissken period! Also Lee Van Cleef Is also in it from a Few Dollars More and The Good, The Bad and The Ugly I just love those Western movies to death. Adrienne Barbeau from The Fog is also in it and she is the beautiful, but deadly Maggie.The plot is set more in the future American by the late 90's. In 1997, when the US President crashes into Manhattan, now a giant maximum security prison, a convicted bank robber is sent in for a rescue. In a world ravaged by crime, the entire island of Manhattan has been converted into a prison which houses the world's most brutal inmates. And when the President of the United States crash lands inside, only one man can bring him back Snake Plissken, a notorious outlaw and former Special Forces war hero who, in exchange for a full pardon, descends into the decayed city and wages a blistering war against the captors. But time is short in 24 hours, an explosive charge planted inside Snake's body will end the mission -- and his life -- unless he succeeds.You've got Kurt Russell, wearing a freaking eye patch and toting a massive assault rifle, squatting in the middle of a fire. You know, just taking it easy, popping a squat while the city burns around him. Non-plussed. Chillaxed. In the background, Lady Liberty's decapitated head lies in the middle of the street, her copper-green eyes staring vacantly up into a crowded, off-kilter skyline. What the hell happened, I wondered. I'd have to wait for Cloverfield to find out, because, as it turns out, that nifty piece of poster art&#x97;while summing up the film's nothing is sacred attitude and permanently establishing Kurt Russell as an icon of badass - has no relation to the film's plot. When I finally managed to see the movie, I kept waiting for Lady Liberty's head to get blown off, but it never happened. I was a little disappointed. And in a way, that's still how I feel about Escape From New York. The premise is a near-perfect action movie set-up, and the world that John Carpenter creates has so much potential for edge-of- your-seat storytelling, but the end result doesn't fully deliver on its promise. But that's not to say that it doesn't have its moments of undiluted awesomeness. Long proclaimed as an action film cult classic, there's surprisingly little action in Escape From New York, at least, not of the Michael Bay, in your face, two explosions per minute variety, the kind to which today's Rockstar-infused audiences are acclimated. Watching the film now, nearly thirty years after it hit theaters in 1981, EFNY seems curiously slow-paced. Snake limps through the city, occasionally bopping a guy in the face, occasionally busting a cap.The film is John Carpenter best work I have seen, there are some other films I don't like, Escape From New York (1981) is one of the best cult classic films from John carpenter and Kurt Russell. Kurt Russell's iconic character of all time Snake Plissken is his best roles of all time on the screen, I have ever seen. I also love the sequel to death the same as I love this film. Snake Plissken is an ex-soldier turned criminal, recruited\/blackmailed into rescuing a hostage president from the prison of New York City. Lee Van Cleef as Bob Hauk New York Police Commissioner did a great job portraying one of the most memorable characters.
