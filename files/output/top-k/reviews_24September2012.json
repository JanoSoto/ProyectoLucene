So, next to starring in this movie, Shatner wrote and directed the movie, just as Nimoy did for the previous Star Trek entry; Star Trek IV The Voyage Home and Star Trek III The Search for Spock, which he only directed. But as it turned out, Shatner's writing and directing skills were not up to par with Nimoy's!This movie does plenty wrong and many thought that the series should had ended here. Star Trek had outlived its course and they had obvious difficulties coming up with new stuff to do and keep things up to date with the standards of filmmaking and science-fiction. It perhaps also was no coincidence that the television series Star Trek The Next Generation, with an all new cast, got launched in 1987, 2 years prior to this movie and 1 year after the previous Star Trek movie entry. You know Star Trek is in trouble when it is starting to take on Star Wars sound effects and tries to mimic Star Wars like sequences. Isn't that like crossing the streams?Thing they came up with for this movie; a search for God. Really doesn't sound like the most spectacular thing and it also really isn't. But what's perhaps even more disappointing is that the movie never goes deep. You would expect for a movie with a subject like that to bring up 2 or 3 interesting and provoking questions about life and religion but the movie really never does. It instead seemed like it was more focused on its comedy! And it's really not the funny sort of comedy but more of the awkward kind. It's very random, silly and often just completely out of place and tone with the rest of the movie. Because of this, there also is never really any sense of danger throughout the movie, which is taking away pretty much all of the excitement and entertainment out of it.Not that the movie is boring. I mean, in all honesty, it's just as good\/bad to watch as any other random science-fiction flick, that involves traveling through space and visiting alien planets. I can still see why this movie is disliked by many, of which most are hardened Star Trek fans. This is pretty much the Star Trek movie in which stuff got made fun of and things turned silly. It also made it obvious how outdated the franchise was getting and how old the cast suddenly turned.All of the cast members were really starting to look too old for their roles. Nothing wrong with having 2 or 3 wrinkly characters walking around but when it's being a whole starship, that is just being a bit too much. And really, this is of course something they easily could had prevented by introducing new characters and letting them slowly and subtly take over the main parts but somehow I think Shatner opposed to this idea and maybe is also a reason why he demanded full control and directed this movie himself.It's also true that this movie really could had used a good main villain. Sybok really isn't an evil character at heart and certainly does nothing horrible and while there are some Klingons walking around in this movie, their roles are being pretty limited unfortunately.In all honesty, it's far from a terrible movie and I certainly still consider it to be a watchable one but it just isn't the most interesting, original, entertaining or clever of Star Trek movies out there.6\/10http\/\/bobafett1138.blogspot.com\/ ","genre":null},{"date":"24 September 2012","score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" William Shatner must have thought; What Leonard Nimoy can do, I can do better!

I am a huge Costner fan even though he has slipped from Hollywood stardom in the last few years. I hadn't seen The Bodyguard in awhile and wanted to review it so I sat down to enjoy it again. I was surprised to discover that I found it a little slow at times, that it looked a little dated, and while I still enjoyed my favourite parts, the grainy and gritty romantic thriller definitely ages itself. But don't let that discourage you. The film is still a classic of its time. The pace of the film is definitely methodical, it doesn't apologize for taking its time to really lay out the characters and the mystery surround the stalker. The characters are all very well developed and the chemistry between Costner and Houston is really what makes this film, and the music of course. Houston's soundtrack to the film is formidable, and brilliant and you buy her as an insanely successful pop princess because she was and still is.Kevin Costner's Frank Farmer is this brooding, seemingly hardened former Secret Service agent. He enters the film mysteriously but you learn more about him throughout the film. Its really a great character and I can't imagine for minute anyone other than Costner playing the role. The late and legendary Whitney Houston plays Rachel Marron. She's the hot headed, short tempered diva but her character takes a lot of turns too and she definitely becomes more likable though she really does remain a diva throughout. Her and Costner are just sexy and brilliant together. The film has a terrific supporting cast including Bill Cobbs, Gary Kemp, Tomas Arana and Mike Starr should be called out for especially strong supporting performances. Michele Lamar Richards does an okay job as Marron's sister Nicki. I always thought she was one of the poorer performances in the film which is really unfortunate especially being what a big important part she has in the film. DeVaughn Nixon does a decent job as Marron's son Fletcher.Everyone works very well together and some of the chemistry (as previously mentioned) is truly great while others go a little understated like Houston and Richards as sisters. Director Mick Jackson was really just getting his legs under him when he directed this film. He does a good job, his direction is decent, but the pacing could have definitely been better handled by more experience. I think he got lucky with a strong cast, especially the stars, and a well written story. Regardless of its few flaws and its slow pace, The Bodyguard is a nineties classic and must see viewing for Costner fans and Houston fans.

That's also being really the foremost thing that I didn't like all that much about it; it isn't really following a clear main story. Its more the type of movie that follows its characters around and shows things as they happen, without building up to anything. There also isn't a classic type of hero or main villain in the movie, which is of course something that not every movie needs to have in it but in this case, I think I would had most definitely preferred it if this movie had those type of characters in it and followed a more usual main story, with a more typical beginning, middle and end in it.Other than that, I can't say that the movie is a bad one but it indeed is one that never hits a home-run, metaphorically speaking. It's nice that the movie tries out plenty of new and unusual stuff and it's definitely being an original movie in the vampire genre but not one that's an absolute must-see for anyone. It's just not quite interesting or entertaining enough for that.Also don't expect this movie to be filled with action or bloodsucking. But that's not a complaint from my part. I liked it that the movie only had a handful of typical vampire moments in it and just about only one big action set piece, that worked out great for the movie and really was all that this movie needed. It set the atmospheric tone and established the 'rules' for this movie, so that the rest of the movie could focus on doing completely other things, which you perhaps normally wouldn't expect being in a vampire flick.The movie also features Bill Paxton and Lance Henriksen in it, among many others. And remember, this is an 80's movie, so that means that it has still awesome Bill Paxton and Lance Henriksen in it! No doubt it helped that director Kathryn Bigelow still was with James Cameron at the time, since he's a director who worked a lot with Bill Paxton and Lance Henriksen around that same time. Same goes for Jenette Goldstein by the way but she is somewhat of a lesser known actress.The main characters are still played by some big unknowns (Adrian Pasdar & Jenny Wright), which is perhaps also being something that somewhat keeps the movie down. A more charismatic main lead for instance could had most likely spiced up things a little bit more and would had gotten you more involved with the movie its story and main character.

The Characters have no names and are introduced only as colors, and that is one of the best scenes of this movie. It is a perfect blend of comedy, violence, crime, character development, plot, all told in a unique and intriguing way.Tarantino will probably never make a movie as well as this one again. He now basks in his own cult following and his love of bad B horror of the 1970's, and seems content in giving us horrible movies, bringing back a genre that nobody ever wanted to see (except really crazy people that rarely get out of their own basements) and there was a reason Hollywood stopped making.I say celebrate this one outstanding movie and remember Quentin when he used to be a decent film maker.

Master of the SF short story, Theodore Sturgeon was once being interviewed on the radio, and the host provocatively asked him why 90% of SF was crap. Sturgeon's snappy reply 90% of EVERYTHING is crap! And this is tritely true. The only reason anyone thinks of the early 19th Century as the golden age of music is because the only stuff that's survived from then till now is the 10% that's NOT crap. But there was plenty of bad classical music being written then, too, and not even all of Beethoven's stuff is top drawer.But that's the facile reply. With more time (such as what I have here), I expand the limited horizons of the critics by expanding their favorite spectrum into the 3rd dimension. They are accustomed to drawing a straight line, labelling one end plot and the other end character, and assigning each book or movie to a point somewhere along that spectrum, depending on what they perceive to be the balance between the 2 elements.But I insert a 3rd point, off the line, forming the vertex of an equilateral triangle, and label it setting. I show my own disdain for mainstream mimetic fiction by saying Sure, ANY old hack writer can start a novel with 'It was raining as the battered gray Chevy pulled up to the Empire State Building, battered gray Harvey Bluedorn emerged, and his battered gray flannel suit immediately started showing big dark blotches.', because your readers immediately understand the setting and circumstances; they're familiar with New York, Chevies, and suits, even if they've never been there, driven one, or worn one.SF and fantasy writers have the added burdens of not only inventing whole new worlds where their stories take place, they must also describe them clearly enuf to form a useful mental picture without dropping a huge expository lump into the early going. (This is somewhat easier for movie-makers, who can show without having to tell, but it's still more challenging than an establishing shot of, say, Antarctica.)So, to me, the ideal balance is not midway between plot and characterization, ignoring the duty of setting altogether, but rather at the center of the equilateral triangle.By that measure, the platinum standard of accomplishment &#x97; the apotheosis of balancing plot, character, and setting, in the full richness of each &#x97; is Gone with the Wind, not merely ONE of the best movies of all time but the VERY best.I speak as a science-fiction and fantasy fan who recognizes that there's not a speck of either in GWTW and still rates it higher than Avatar or Lord of the Rings (but they're also smack-dab in the middle of the Critical Triangle if you take the time to look).

That's what pulp fiction is defined as, and that's just what Pulp Fiction is, exciting and titillating.Ever since Reservoir Dogs back in 1992, Tarantino has kept on producing top quality films such as this one in 1994, the Kill Bill series, Death Proof, and most recently, Inglourious Basterds. One of Quentin Tarantino's greatest work and truly a masterpiece in it's own sense, the timing was perfect; made during the transition phase from the 20th to the 21st Century, Pulp Fiction isn't too intense for the past generation and isn't too old for the current to disapprove of. It won the Palme D'Or Award when it premiered at the Cannes film festival. Although Tarantino and his screenplay partner Roger Avary received the award only for the best original screenplay, it was also nominated for the best picture and the best director at the 1995 Academy Awards. There are numerous other awards and countless nominations that Pulp Fiction has received over the years.If you're familiar with Tarantino's earlier works, then you know that nonlinear storytelling is his trademark. This is also incorporated in Pulp Fiction where the narrative is structured around three separate but intersecting story lines. The lead of the first story is the mob hit-man Vincent Vega, played by John Travolta. The boxer Butch Coolidge, played by Bruce Willis, is the lead of the second, and Vincent's partner, Jules Winnfield, played by Samuel L. Jackson, is the lead of the third. It is an excellent example of a postmodern film, where mainstream conventions and norms are twisted and churned into brilliance. But I do warn the easily queasy and squeamish, there is A LOT of graphic violence, drug use, and profanity in this movie. It is definitely not a movie for children to watch and I wouldn't recommend taking your date out to watch it.However, if you aren't familiar with this type of storytelling and think you can handle the violence, you should definitely give it a go. When I first saw Pulp Fiction, I didn't know what to expect either. The movie poster seemed like an old cheap rundown book cover and I had never heard of Tarantino before. However, after my first watch, I was totally sold. The acting by Travolta, Willis, and especially, Jackson were profound; it was their prime performance. The cinematography, lead by the same people who had worked with Tarantino on Reservoir Dogs, fit the story very well. An excellent portrayal of this is in the scene in the car where Vincent accidentally shoots Marvin in the face and his matter is spread all over the interior of the car. Marvin's body and the gunshot wound aren't shown in the movie; the audience only sees the gunshot and a lot of blood in the car. This allows the viewer to imagine the scene in his\/her own way.The nonlinear storytelling is also well portrayed in this movie. It might throw the average viewer off at first; however, you get accustomed to it, and by the end, you've a good understanding of the plot. Also, the dialogue in the movie is very plain and normal; the characters' conversation is what an average Joe would have when doing the same thing. This makes the characters relate with the audience. An example of this is in the scene in the beginning of the movie where Vincent and Jules discuss about a Quarter-pounder with Cheese from McDonalds being called Royale with Cheese in France because of the metric system. Pulp Fiction is truly something worth watching in your lifetime. I definitely recommend this movie; even if you don't enjoy it, you will appreciate the genius it oozes. So grab your popcorn with extra butter and your diet Pepsi, or what have you, lie back on your couch, and enjoy!

One of Quentin Tarantino's greatest work and truly a masterpiece in it's own sense, the timing was perfect; made during the transition phase from the 20th to the 21st Century, Pulp Fiction isn't too intense for the past generation and isn't too old for the current to disapprove of. It won the Palme D'Or Award when it premiered at the Cannes film festival. Although Tarantino and his screenplay partner Roger Avary received the award only for the best original screenplay, it was also nominated for the best picture and the best director at the 1995 Academy Awards. There are numerous other awards and countless nominations that Pulp Fiction has received over the years.If you're familiar with Tarantino's earlier works, then you know that nonlinear storytelling is his trademark. This is also incorporated in Pulp Fiction where the narrative is structured around three separate but intersecting story lines. The lead of the first story is the mob hit-man Vincent Vega, played by John Travolta. The boxer Butch Coolidge, played by Bruce Willis, is the lead of the second, and Vincent's partner, Jules Winnfield, played by Samuel L. Jackson, is the lead of the third. It is an excellent example of a postmodern film, where mainstream conventions and norms are twisted and churned into brilliance. But I do warn the easily queasy and squeamish, there is A LOT of graphic violence, drug use, and profanity in this movie. It is definitely not a movie for children to watch and I wouldn't recommend taking your date out to watch it.However, if you aren't familiar with this type of storytelling and think you can handle the violence, you should definitely give it a go. When I first saw Pulp Fiction, I didn't know what to expect either. The movie poster seemed like an old cheap rundown book cover and I had never heard of Tarantino before. However, after my first watch, I was totally sold. The acting by Travolta, Willis, and especially, Jackson were profound; it was their prime performance. The cinematography, lead by the same people who had worked with Tarantino on Reservoir Dogs, fit the story very well. An excellent portrayal of this is in the scene in the car where Vincent accidentally shoots Marvin in the face and his matter is spread all over the interior of the car. Marvin's body and the gunshot wound aren't shown in the movie; the audience only sees the gunshot and a lot of blood in the car. This allows the viewer to imagine the scene in his\/her own way.The nonlinear storytelling is also well portrayed in this movie. It might throw the average viewer off at first; however, you get accustomed to it, and by the end, you've a good understanding of the plot. Also, the dialogue in the movie is very plain and normal; the characters' conversation is what an average Joe would have when doing the same thing. This makes the characters relate with the audience. An example of this is in the scene in the beginning of the movie where Vincent and Jules discuss about a Quarter-pounder with Cheese from McDonalds being called Royale with Cheese in France because of the metric system. Pulp Fiction is truly something worth watching in your lifetime. I definitely recommend this movie; even if you don't enjoy it, you will appreciate the genius it oozes. So grab your popcorn with extra butter and your diet Pepsi, or what have you, lie back on your couch, and enjoy!

No cocky kids, or persons who think they know best and are afraid of nothing but instead some real people, with real fears and emotions.

I fully understand why Chan might choose this otherwise utterly forgettable film to break into bigger movies - it doesn't let things like a plot get in the way of Chan doing what he does best as well as showing off his comic timing which, whilst not brilliant, at least offers something more than a grimacing hero endlessly bashing the baddies until the credits roll. In most other martial-arts films, the end climax involves the lead baddie use a variety of weapons which will cause the hero to bleed but not enough to prevent good triumphing over evil. In this film, the climax is so ridiculous that even my wife burst out laughing. If you can drop your serious face and revel in the goofiness of it then this might entertain you as much as it did me. Just don't take it seriously because if anything, this is probably the least serious film I've seen all year.

As such, it looks pretty dry and boring at first glance, but the actual subject of the experiment is something of fascination that prompts further study. Altered States presents the idea that powerful drugs can create a conduit for a person to touch the inner self (and possibly touching God at the same time), allowing one access to six billion years of genetic memories stored in the human body. As the main character continuously dabbles with the forbidden fruit of mind-altering substances, he comes closer and closer to inhabiting the body of the world's first primordial human being, complete with raw primal instincts and unbridled physical power.The concept is really high-level stuff, provoking lots of introspect into the human spirit, human evolution, and humanity's relationship with spirituality and religion. Above all, the film is most memorable for being visually insane. There are several sequences where the film bombards you with rapid-fire freak-out imagery. I've yet to see any other film where the screen flashes weird goat heads, bloody knives, hellish scenes of crucifixions and boiling hot magma, giant snakes, sex, the universe, and lord knows what else all at once. Scenes like this make the film very pungent, and it stands out as one of the trippiest experiences on film.In between the occasional freak-outs, the film slows down quite a bit. The film goes on to follow these scientist characters, who form some profound relationships and rivalries, but most of these scenes come off as rather plain and dry, especially when compared to the film's most vivid imagery. I couldn't tell you if such contrast is intentional or not. Regardless, it is an intriguing story with a cast of halfway decent characters.The film has its share of extremely hard-hitting imagery and extremely plain photography. Editing can be pretty erratic during the freak-out scenes, but for intentional effect; the film is very successful at beating its trippiness over your head. Acting is decent William Hurt is especially noteworthy. Writing is quite sophisticated, but could potentially go over some viewers' heads. This production has okay-looking sets, props, and costumes, and the special effects are impressive for its time. Music is alright.Overall, this is a movie for the left side of the brain. If that interests you, then the film is certainly recommended. Otherwise, you might still want to see it for some of the trippiest (and possibly scariest) images ever committed to celluloid.4\/5 (Entertainment Average | Story Very Good | Film Good) ","genre":null},{"date":"24 September 2012","score":"","review":" This film basically plays out like one extended science experiment.

Will he survive? Well, while waiting to find out, the film takes an amazing turn. Up until the heart attack, it's a SOMEWHAT conventional film about the making of a play. BUT, after the attack, it suddenly becomes VERY surreal--with many song and dance numbers that explore death! In this sense, the film really is a lot like Fellini's 8 1\/2--but with song and dance numbers! I could say more...but don't want to spoil what happens next. Just hold on...the final scene is one of the most amazingly stunning in film history!!All That Jazz is one of those rare films that I didn't particularly enjoy BUT I really respected what it tried to do. While it is similar, in some ways, to a few other films (such as 42nd Street), the total package is wholly unique--and for that reason alone it deserves to be seen. But, I am warning you, it's very possible you won't like a lot of the film because the leading man is pretty awful--drinking to excess, using drugs to excess, using women to excess--heck, doing EVERYTHING to excess! Interestingly, the film's director, Bob Fosse, intended this as a sort of autobiography--so I assume Fosse was a very talented but incredibly screwed up man...AND, he welcomed the world to see this!! This was either a case of incredible narcissism or perhaps a cry for help or understanding--I have no idea which the case might be! I mentioned how All That Jazz is a lot like 42nd Street. This is because in 42nd Street (the film), Warner Baxter is in many ways the manic Broadway producer that Scheider is in All That Jazz--and, in the end, he burns himself out and dies--all for the sake of the show. As far as 8 1\/2 goes, it's much more likely you've seen that and it's a very strange film that explores a film director whose life is VERY hectic and he retreats into fantasy and day dreams to cope with his out of control life. All these films are well worth seeing and would make a great triple-feature.By the way, less than a decade after All That Jazz, Fosse really DID die of a heart attack at age 60. Talk about art imitating life!! NOTE This film has many adult themes, language and nudity. Think twice before showing this to your mother or kids.
