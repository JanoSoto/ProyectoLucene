While I can easily see where Not Another Teen Movie got a portion of it's plot, this movie is still great. Not only does this movie have a stellar cast - which I'll get to in a moment - but the movie has a twist and a tear jerker ending.Sarah Michelle Gellar stars as Kathryn. She plays a stuck up rich girl who likes to have everything and everyone go her way. When her current boyfriend is stolen by the dim-witted Cecile (Selma Blair), Kathryn seeks revenge in exposing Cecile.Ryan Phillippe who plays Sebastien, Kathryn's stepbrother, finds the plan of Cecile too easy and all girls of Manhattan insipid and wants a more difficult challenge. He reads about Annette, a virgin girl waiting for love, in Seventeen magazine. With the help of her moving in with his aunt, his sees an opportunity to make his biggest conquest yet and bed her before the start of the new school year.Kathryn wagers a bet with Sebastien. The terms If Kathryn wins, Sebastien loses his 1956 Jaguar Roadster to Kathryn. If Sebastien wins, Sebastien gets Kathryn. While it starts off as a game, Sebastien begins to fall for Annette.Annette is played by my favourite actress Reese Witherspoon. While at first I was a little angry at seeing Reese cry on screen, it seemed alright a second time since her tears didn't ruin her beauty. Ryan Phillippe and Reese Witherspoon actually married shortly after filming the movie, even though the movie wasn't what brought them together.Selma Blair, finally, plays Cecile. While she is older than both Sarah and Ryan, she played the young freshman. She has a small role and thanks to Not Another Teen Movie, the kiss between Sarah and Selma is not as exciting, but it still adds to the movie.There is a few other small cameos including, Christine Baranski, Sean Patrick Thomas, Eric Mabius and Joshua Jackson, with a tiny 2 minute appearance by crying Tara Reid.The movie itself without the actors is great. While it's mainly a thriller\/suspense, I find it to be more romance and I came out satisfied because of it. However, once again, this movie proves that nothing is permanent. In Wedding Crashers, the character of Claire (Rachel McAdams) cheats on her 3-year boyfriend. Reese Witherspoon's character Annette cheats on her 1-year boyfriend. Now I'm not picking on girls, but notice that the two I just mentioned are girls cheating.Nonetheless, the romance blossoms and I nearly was in tears just before the end. Kathryn is also a cleverly written character. When I got other's thoughts people told me that it was possibly Annette (Reese) who was the evil one in the entire movie. Anyone who has seen this can tell who the villain is.With the supporting cast, the excellent plot and romance and the fact of a small sex scene in the movie, you won't want to miss this. (Ryan Phillippe is probably the luckiest guy I know...) Not to mention, Sarah Michelle Gellar is hot as ever and the rest of the stars certainly put on amazing performances. I almost didn't like this movie on how the Annette character was treated. Not because I liked the character, but because I like Reese Witherspoon. However, since the movie ended happy, I'll say that I'm happy how the character ended.If you've yet to see this watch it, same goes for anyone who thought nah. If you've seen it already, watch it again. I can't get enough of Reese Witherspoon.

I must say it was a very unconventional and the plot was very, very jarring.While trying to be as unspecific about the details of the plot as possible, it basically follows the story of a Pete Appleton, a Hollywood screenwriter, who after a car accident in which he falls into a river causes him to suffer amnesia, ends up washed up on a beach-side town and is recognised as somebody who has died in World War II.There is a very particular style that the director uses really well. This movie, which is set in the 50's with a lot of time spent talking about the movies that were being made at the time, imitates the style of film that was being made at the time. A convoluted plot that seems to lend itself to a romantic comedy, the tone is feel-good, light, non-violent, non-edgy and with a heavy romance element that was so innocent that it harked right back to the era where a kiss was seen as vulgar.However, the events that take place in the movie are seriously dramatic and tension-building and it seems like the movie is going to end in a very dark place despite all the, obviously deliberate, colouring of the light elements thrown in. Its an interesting contrast and left me feeling a bit uneasy all the way through.As you can tell, the tone of the movie was all over the place, but this didn't make the movie worse, in fact it was one of the best qualities.

Roger, the fun-loving Toon star of Maroon Cartoons, is married to a beautiful Toon woman, Jessica Rabbit, and Roger had become distraught that she may have been having an affair with his boss Marvin Acme (Stubby Kaye), and Acme himself later turns up dead, with Roger as the #1 suspect. As Eddie digs deeper and deeper into his investigation, he soon finds himself on the run and having to journey to Toontown (the home of all the Toons in Hollywood), one of the last places on Earth he wants to be for reasons I'll explain later. This was one of my favorite movies from my childhood (I was three when it was originally released), and it still is after happening upon a recent viewing of the picture, and I only recently discovered that it was not an original piece as I once believed, but it's adapted from the novel Who Censored Roger Rabbit? by Gary K. Wolf. Does that mean I love it any less? Of course not. It just gives me more room to appreciate what director Robert Zemeckis and screenwriters Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman were able to do with the story. This movie is fantastic, especially with its mix of comedy, detective-noir, and good old-fashioned murder-mystery whodunit. It's also brilliant for its Oscar-winning special effects, which combine live-action with animation. That's been done before, but I've never seen it done with the care and precision as it's done in Who Framed Roger Rabbit. The whole movie is like a dream, a dream where people can happily coexist with their favorite cartoon characters, rather than go to the theater for the on-screen antics. Judge Doom (Christopher Lloyd from Zemeckis's earlier Back to the Future) is a classic movie villain, with his all-black fatigues, snarl, and typical bad-guy demeanor; there's also a unique twist with his character that you have to see to believe. Bob Hoskins is great as Eddie Valiant, in what is arguably his best-known American film role; growing up, I of course had no idea that he was actually British, but he pulls off his American accent perfectly. One of the things I really like about his character is the resentment he has toward Toons, since one killed his brother several years before this film's story takes place, and his attempts to clear Roger Rabbit of murder charges provides a foundation for him to overcome his hatred. (Am I the only one who spots the obvious parallels to racism here?) Who Framed Roger Rabbit is a classic comedy\/fantasy, and undoubtedly one of my favorite movies.

Roger, the fun-loving Toon star of Maroon Cartoons, is married to a beautiful Toon woman, Jessica Rabbit, and Roger had become distraught that she may have been having an affair with his boss Marvin Acme (Stubby Kaye), and Acme himself later turns up dead, with Roger as the #1 suspect. As Eddie digs deeper and deeper into his investigation, he soon finds himself on the run and having to journey to Toontown (the home of all the Toons in Hollywood), one of the last places on Earth he wants to be for reasons I'll explain later. This was one of my favorite movies from my childhood (I was three when it was originally released), and it still is after happening upon a recent viewing of the picture, and I only recently discovered that it was not an original piece as I once believed, but it's adapted from the novel Who Censored Roger Rabbit? by Gary K. Wolf. Does that mean I love it any less? Of course not. It just gives me more room to appreciate what director Robert Zemeckis and screenwriters Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman were able to do with the story. This movie is fantastic, especially with its mix of comedy, detective-noir, and good old-fashioned murder-mystery whodunit. It's also brilliant for its Oscar-winning special effects, which combine live-action with animation. That's been done before, but I've never seen it done with the care and precision as it's done in Who Framed Roger Rabbit. The whole movie is like a dream, a dream where people can happily coexist with their favorite cartoon characters, rather than go to the theater for the on-screen antics. Judge Doom (Christopher Lloyd from Zemeckis's earlier Back to the Future) is a classic movie villain, with his all-black fatigues, snarl, and typical bad-guy demeanor; there's also a unique twist with his character that you have to see to believe. Bob Hoskins is great as Eddie Valiant, in what is arguably his best-known American film role; growing up, I of course had no idea that he was actually British, but he pulls off his American accent perfectly. One of the things I really like about his character is the resentment he has toward Toons, since one killed his brother several years before this film's story takes place, and his attempts to clear Roger Rabbit of murder charges provides a foundation for him to overcome his hatred. (Am I the only one who spots the obvious parallels to racism here?) Who Framed Roger Rabbit is a classic comedy\/fantasy, and undoubtedly one of my favorite movies.

So lame that it boggles the mind to imagine that this film was made in the first place. I can only assume that the writers and execs at the studio were under the influence of some mind-altering drug while they were watching a re-run of a Francis the Mule film or else had loved ones kidnapped in order to force this film to be made. This is the only way you could understand this film. Even the worst of the most contrived Disney films of the 1960s and 70s look like Gone With the Wind compared to this! Matt LeBlanc stars as a guy who has a great pitching arm. However, when his game stinks, the manager punishes him by sending him to pick someone up at the bus stop. That 'someone' turns out to be a baseball playing chimp who is the team's new mascot. When I first saw this chimp, he really looked creepy--and I assume it was just a midget in an ape suit. It looked more realistic than chimps looked in films in 1940, but still looked bizarre and a bit scary! Well, only in a movie would it turn out that the chimp was a fantastic baseball player--with an arm like a rocket AND a thorough knowledge of how to play ball! How all the actors were able to participate in this farce of a film with straight faces is beyond me. Talk about an insane plot! Even small children would find this tough to swallow. However, given that he ultimately is SMARTER than LeBlanc isn't quite as hard to believe (at least in light of his role on Friends).Some of the low-points in this dreadful film include frequent fart jokes, snot jokes, Ed and LeBlanc both peeing together at the same toilet, belching, Ed driving a truck at what appears to be 400 mph, more fart jokes and Ed plying dress-up with grandma's clothes. At no point in the film is it clever or does it poke fun of itself (the only way this MIGHT have worked).Overall, a sorry mess of a film that is so inexplicably dumb that I can't believe it was made in the first place. Practically every cliché known to baseball is in this film and its only entertainment value is for people who want to laugh at the sheer inanity of the movie.

So the fact that I say it's bad or anyone else says it's bad is certainly no surprise. It's like someone talking about WWII--practically no one says that was a GOOD thing, right?! The question I have and no place on IMDb can answer it is why did they make this in the first place?!. After all, it's obvious to anyone who isn't severely brain injured that the film would be horrible. But, movies like ED (a baseball playing chimp), COOL AS ICE (starring the ever-popular Vanilla Ice), TROLL 2 (which doesn't even have any trolls in it), BABY GENIUSES (Einstain-like superhero babies) and PINOCCHIO IN OUTER SPACE (huh!?!) prove that any idea, no matter how dumb, can make it to the big screen! So, the idea of the best basketball player of the time starring as a genie to an obnoxious little brat seems downright 'normal'! The film starts with a kid who is pretty jerky keying the lockers in the hallway of the school. Like the punk from FREE WILLY, this kid is somehow 'misunderstood' (in other words, a total brat) and you know that no matter how selfish and horrible he is, by the end of the film he'll have learned something and grown. Just once, I want to see a punk kid like this end up in prison or or dead by the end of the film! Eventually, while the neighborhood bullies are in the middle of pummeling him, the genie Kazaam (Shaquille O'Neal)is accidentally released and insists on giving the brat three wishes. But, the kid doesn't believe him AND the genie's magic seems a tad rusty.Eventually the brat does realize that Kazaam is for real. However, unlike most kids, he withholds making his wishes so, in the meantime, Kazaam is forced to follow him around everywhere--like his own personal servant. And, according to the cliché, you know that by the end of the film, Max and Kazaam will have become lifelong buddies and a bunch of tears will be shed. Oh, and Max will have come to terms with his absent father and mom's fiancé (I'm gonna gag). Apparently this genie is a bit of a social worker in addition to being a granter of wishes.As for Kazaam, Shaquille speaks in rhyme through much of the movie and even takes a break to rap...very poorly. I'm a middle-aged white guy and I think I could probably rap at least as well! He's an amazing basketball player and I've heard he's a nice guy--but a rapper...no way! As far as his acting goes, he wasn't great but had such a nice personality in the film that it's hard to hate him--even if they made him do a lot of very stupid things.So is the movie as excruciatingly awful as you've probably heard? through the first two-thirds of the movie, I would have said no. Shaquille seemed to try his best with an unlikable kid and a bad script. However, later in the film, the bad becomes horrid--as Kazaam seems too concerned with himself to help the kid when he's really needed. And, out of nowhere, the plot gets really, really weird--as the guy who wants to make Kazaam a rap star(?!?!) turns out to be an evil mobster! And, oddly, this guy seems to accept that Kazaam is a genie with no hesitation! In addition, the last portion of the film consists of people trying to kill Max and his dad. I know that the kid was annoying, but this is supposed to be a kids' film!! What part of 'trying to kill the kid' didn't the writers not understand?!? Then, in an ending that makes this perhaps the worst kids film ending in history, Kazaam becomes god or something and it all was like a drug-induced hallucination! This ending was even dumber and weirder than the one in THE BLACK HOLE...and boy, did it make my brain hurt!! Uggghh--the horrible dialog was just too much to bear!!!Overall, it's a terrible film that is due mostly to writers who were certifiably insane.

Sadly, given the idea and actors, it's hard to imagine the final product turning out much worse!!By the way, if you want to see a Genie in a modern world film that is GOOD, try the British made for TV film Bernard and the Genie--a charming and exceptionally well-written film from start to finish.

However, unlike most kids, he withholds making his wishes so, in the meantime, Kazaam is forced to follow him around everywhere--like his own personal servant. And, according to the cliché, you know that by the end of the film, Max and Kazaam will have become lifelong buddies and a bunch of tears will be shed. Oh, and Max will have come to terms with his absent father and mom's fiancé (I'm gonna gag). Apparently this genie is a bit of a social worker in addition to being a granter of wishes.As for Kazaam, Shaquille speaks in rhyme through much of the movie and even takes a break to rap...very poorly. I'm a middle-aged white guy and I think I could probably rap at least as well! He's an amazing basketball player and I've heard he's a nice guy--but a rapper...no way! As far as his acting goes, he wasn't great but had such a nice personality in the film that it's hard to hate him--even if they made him do a lot of very stupid things.So is the movie as excruciatingly awful as you've probably heard? through the first two-thirds of the movie, I would have said no. Shaquille seemed to try his best with an unlikable kid and a bad script. However, later in the film, the bad becomes horrid--as Kazaam seems too concerned with himself to help the kid when he's really needed. And, out of nowhere, the plot gets really, really weird--as the guy who wants to make Kazaam a rap star(?!?!) turns out to be an evil mobster! And, oddly, this guy seems to accept that Kazaam is a genie with no hesitation! In addition, the last portion of the film consists of people trying to kill Max and his dad. I know that the kid was annoying, but this is supposed to be a kids' film!! What part of 'trying to kill the kid' didn't the writers not understand?!? Then, in an ending that makes this perhaps the worst kids film ending in history, Kazaam becomes god or something and it all was like a drug-induced hallucination! This ending was even dumber and weirder than the one in THE BLACK HOLE...and boy, did it make my brain hurt!! Uggghh--the horrible dialog was just too much to bear!!!Overall, it's a terrible film that is due mostly to writers who were certifiably insane. Yes, folks, with a messed up message, bizarre non-kid friendly material and horrible characters, this is one wretched film. Sadly, given the idea and actors, it's hard to imagine the final product turning out much worse!!By the way, if you want to see a Genie in a modern world film that is GOOD, try the British made for TV film Bernard and the Genie--a charming and exceptionally well-written film from start to finish.

There are some quite 'new' techniques used in this movie and it's stuff that you would normally expect so see in an early Akira Kurosawa movie.But there is of course much more to this movie. You also have to give credit for the movie its directing, by George Stevens, that keeps the story flowing and going. And even though quite a lot is happening, the movie manages to tell the story in just over 2 hours, without ever feeling rushed at any points, or as if the movie skipped a few beats that were in the novel perhaps.The movie obviously had some great source material to work with. It got based on a novel called An American Tragedy, written by Theodore Dreiser and its later stage-play, by Patrick Kearney. It's a story about a far from perfect or successful man. When finally things start to go right for him and he gets a good job, thanks to being the nephew of a successful business man who owns a big factory, he makes the mistake for falling for two totally different girls. Ready to leave the one for the other he soon finds himself in a tight spot when the girl he no longer is in love with or wants to be with turns out to be pregnant by him. The story gets told in such a way that everything becomes highly convincing, in the way that this could basically happen to every average person in real-life as well.There is plenty of well written drama in this movie, without ever becoming a melodramatic genre piece. Therefore this movie is more recommendable to just everyone, even when you just aren't too into older movies.It was also great seeing so many great actors playing their parts in this movie. Montgomery Clift, who at first seems like just another pretty Hollywood face, is real convincing as this average person who gets himself into some real trouble and has to life a sort of a two lives, due to the circumstances. And no matter how weird and odd Elizabeth Taylor looks and seems these days, back in her prime she was simply stunning and also a real talented actress. I also really liked Raymond Burr in this one and it sort of made me wish that his role was longer and bigger.

It is well directed, well acted, and hits all the targets. On the other hand it is a movie I felt unclean watching. The idea of Chucky has lost what ever originality it had in the original film. Instead we get a genuinely evil character torturing a poor little boy for the film. I honestly think you'd have to be mentally ill to find entertainment in 'Child's Play 2'.I liked the original 'Child's Play' a great deal, and I even enjoy 'Bride of Chucky' a lot for it's camp entertainment value. I will say though that I absolutely hate Chucky as a character. It's no fault to Brad Dourif who is an excellent actor and gives some very good vocal work as Chucky. If anything Dourif makes me hate Chucky for all the right reasons. The problem I see with this picture is that it is staged so that Chucky is always the vocal point of everything. Alex Vincent isn't the main character of the picture. We are in a sense encouraged to follow Chucky and still despise him at the same time. It doesn't work.Many fans praise this film for it's black humor. I think this is actually one of the worst things about the film. Don Mancini has written a script that takes this little terror with utmost sincerity. Any joke involving Chucky isn't tongue in cheek, the viciousness is still there. Where as in the superior 'Bride of Chucky' Mancini recognizes the scenario as being very stupid and he plays off that for some brilliant jokes. I think I have to credit Mancini for why this film is terrible. He has written a grim hopeless opus for black souls. It isn't easy for me to do this. I've liked plenty of horror films that have been considered dark and too ugly by mainstream critics. It's a testament to Brad Dourif for taking Mancini's script and bringing it to this level.I think the biggest problem with the script is that Andy is completely alone in his battle with Chucky. Conceptually Mancini is ripping off his original 'Child's Play' to the keel. No one believes little Andy until the bodies pile up. This story is tiresome and unoriginal. Mancini recycles it over and over again but through different lenses. In my opinion he's a lazy screenwriter who struck gold with this character. The concept of a killer doll isn't original enough to recycle the same stories for this killer doll to inhabit. I wish Mancini put more time into his stories than he did into creating this little terror. I'm not praising Mancini in anyway for making Chucky so evil. Mancini was given a tremendous gift in having Brad Dourif respect him and take this role. If a lesser actor took it this character would have died off after the original film.In a sense I have to award Alex Vincent and Brad Dourif praise. They have taken these characters to the utmost degree. I feared for little Andy, and despised little Chucky.Director John Lafia is very good at creating pure horror, not suspense, not fear, but actual horror. He has given us a horrendous situation. To his credit he does it really well. The thing is thought that audiences don't like horror, they like simulated fear. 'Child's Play 2' in all it's silliness has genuine horror. Some sequences are genuinely hard to sit through because of Lafia's staging. He takes Mancini's awful script and really brings out the most in it. I think Tom Holland knew how to better frame this concept. He knew that audiences were attracted to the concept and not the character of Chucky. I could have fun with the original 'Child's Play'.

Recently, however, I managed to acquire THE BLOB via a copy of the Spanish DVD which, interestingly, ported over the two Audio Commentary tracks from the Criterion Special Edition&#x85;but, regrettably, I could not switch off the Spanish subtitles during playback of the main feature!

The male lead was an early role for Steve(n) McQueen and, though the actor may have subsequently looked at it with disdain, his sole contribution to the genre proves fairly engaging not averse to juvenile kicks but still essentially a decent (and, more importantly, altruistic) kid. The special effects depicting the slimy and expanding creature are not too bad of its kind and period; the film itself rises to a good climax &#x96; beginning with the monster's invasion of a cinema (showing DAUGHTER OF HORROR 1953\/7 as I mentioned recently in that film's review but being curiously screened 'flipped' and which sequence, incidentally, would be featured at the opening of a satirical Italian program actually called Blob!). As to the admittedly minor quibbles I have with the film the monster is not shown traveling &#x96; it just turns up at a variety of places, never being seen by anyone!; there is a baffling over-emphasis (tantamount to padding) on the kids' scrapes with Police; it is silly to have the town doctor shoot at The Blob &#x96; as if fluid, whatever its proportion, can be destroyed by bullets!; equally nonsensical is having the teenagers alert the townsfolk of the danger by making door-to-door visits (especially when considering that, at that stage, only McQueen had actually seen the monster in action)! An inferior sequel emerged in 1972 called BEWARE THE BLOB!; the original was then remade in 1988 &#x96; I watched this not too long ago but it seems not to have made a lasting impression on me (though I know Micheal Elliott loves it). For the record, I will be following this viewing with two more collaborations between director Yeaworth and producer Jack H. Harris, namely 4D MAN (1959) and DINOSAURUS! (1960).

A bit later, they hook up with Clark Gable (an aging bachelor cowboy) and a man who has a place to rent (Eli Wallach) and they strike up a friendship during the course of an impromptu party.After years of being on his own (he'd been married a long time ago), aging cowboy\/rodeo performer Gable is tired of his tough life and seems ready to perhaps settle down with Monroe. As for Monroe, she's interested but still confused as to what she wants to do with her life. A potential relationship between the two seems to be brewing.A bit later, as the four friends are driving down the road, they notice Montgomery Clift sitting by the phone booth in the middle of nowhere. Gable and Wallach recognize him and stop. They take Clift to the rodeo where he proceeds to get the snot knocked out of him! During both the bronco and bull rides, Monroe practically comes unhinged trying to get Clift to stop and she cries hysterically until she learns he's bruised but otherwise okay. At this point, it's pretty obvious that Monroe is quite taken with Clift...and that Monroe is very tenderhearted towards animals and Clift. In addition, over time, the extreme differences between Gable and Monroe become terribly obvious and you know this relationship is doomed. See the film for yourself to see how it all plays out in this unusual film.As for the film, I liked it in some ways. The story was very unusual and quite original. The parallels between the five wayward people who were misfits and the horses was interesting and the story could have worked...but I couldn't help but think the power of the script was undone by a case of producers pushing too hard for names--big name actors to try to draw in the public as opposed to letting the story speak for itself.I dunno, but I was surprised by Marilyn Monroe's delivery in this film. Despite zillions adoring her and some rave reviews, I think her performance was terrible--by far the worst in the film. It seems that throughout most of the film she sounded like she was impersonating someone with emphysema--as she kept breathing louder and louder and taking huge breaths in the middle of sentences. Frankly, I think she sounded like Stevie from Malcolm in the Middle and can't understand why she played her part that way. Perhaps all of her emotional problems were affecting her performance, as this was the last film she made before her untimely death.As for Clark Gable, he was good in the film but seemed oddly cast. Having this aging actor play against Marilyn Monroe just didn't seem to work--the same problem Gable had in It Happened in Naples when he starred, just a year earlier, with Sophia Loren! You wonder why he kept agreeing to films like these. Perhaps he didn't want to acknowledge that he was nearly 60, but he just didn't allow himself to age gracefully in films like Cary Grant did.Now I don't know about you, but I was surprised to see Clift in such a rugged role. While I know he'd taken a few similar roles in the past (such as RED RIVER and FROM HERE TO ETERNITY), but with his super-slight frame and looks such roles seemed ill-suited to him...though they seemed like good career choices in hindsight. As for me, I didn't mind his acting but just thought Clift was silly as a rodeo cowboy--especially with his refined and very non-western voice.In fact, this is my criticism of the film--too many people just didn't seem to belong in Nevada. I think with a different cast, they could have carried off the plot a bit easier. As a result, it was a good film but an oddly surreal film at the same time--and very tough to accept.

Having this aging actor play against Marilyn Monroe just didn't seem to work--the same problem Gable had in It Happened in Naples when he starred, just a year earlier, with Sophia Loren! You wonder why he kept agreeing to films like these. Perhaps he didn't want to acknowledge that he was nearly 60, but he just didn't allow himself to age gracefully in films like Cary Grant did.Now I don't know about you, but I was surprised to see Clift in such a rugged role. While I know he'd taken a few similar roles in the past (such as RED RIVER and FROM HERE TO ETERNITY), but with his super-slight frame and looks such roles seemed ill-suited to him...though they seemed like good career choices in hindsight. As for me, I didn't mind his acting but just thought Clift was silly as a rodeo cowboy--especially with his refined and very non-western voice.In fact, this is my criticism of the film--too many people just didn't seem to belong in Nevada. I think with a different cast, they could have carried off the plot a bit easier. As a result, it was a good film but an oddly surreal film at the same time--and very tough to accept. It was as if believability was unimportant and star power was the only serious concern.Overall, an interesting experiment that's worth seeing. But, sadly, not much more.

Every one acted very well,Sandra and Ashley Judd are hot and also acted well. But the lead Matthew McConaughey just screwed the whole movie with his disgusting acting. You cannot enjoy the movie without noticing his irritating dialog delivery and worst acting. He just spoils the entire movie watching experience. Who the hell does even think of casting him in their movies. Even the girl who played the character of the rape victim acted very well compared to him. His acting is disgusting. Which spoils the thrill. You can enjoy the movie if you can ignore his awful acting, but the problem is, you won't be able to, since he plays the lead role. So the whole movie watching thrill is screwed. My advice is, better read the book... You'll enjoy the book whole lot more than the movie...
