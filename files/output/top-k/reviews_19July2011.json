It's about some guys from an organization (that I can't conclude which one is) that have to fight against a cannibal man. This cannibal man is from the own organization and masks it pretty well.There are some philosophical references to Plato and Aristotle involving human nature and truth. The visual of the film tries to resemble an erudite community. Sadly, the movie doesn't answer some questions you want to know the answer and the background sound doesn't fit at times (for instance when Colqhoun killed them all outside the cave and runs after the guy that left, they strangely let it play a country jingle). But it is still watchable and interesting to see! ","genre":null},{"date":"19 July 2011","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Ravenous is a worth seeing movie.
