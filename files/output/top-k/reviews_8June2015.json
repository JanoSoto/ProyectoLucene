He seems to play basically the same character whatever he does, but this character seemed different, and Spade should get credit for challenging himself. He is at his best when being funny, but he lacked something in the more dramatic scenes.And I can't say I liked every scene, but many scenes were enjoyable. In general, I like the type of humor here, but some gags were just too disgusting for me.Dennis Miller did a great job. While I know he has had a radio show since then, I don't know anything about it, but he proved he could do that.The audience for Joe Dirt's story added something. So many people seemed fascinated by him, and that added something to the movie.I liked Kicking Wing and the bizarre fireworks jokes. One went kind of overboard but this particular joke could be forgiven for a reason I won't give away.Brandy was not only a sweet girl but quite good-looking, especially in short shorts. And even if I don't like dogs, the dog added something too.Christopher Walken gave yet another weird but quality performance as a janitor who hired Joe when he needed work. It appeared some of his lines recalled other movies or TV shows. His story turned out to be quite interesting too, and I shouldn't give away any of the wacky twists.Jaime Pressly was another hot girl and more than just pretty. I have seen her win awards for similar characters, and I could tell she was more than just an ordinary actress. Whether I would have known this if I had seen this first I can't say.There was just so much silliness of the Jerry Springer and possibly Myrtle Manor variety (I've never seen Myrtle Manor) that I couldn't help but be happy at times. And then there were the warm and touching scenes, which made all the suffering worth it.And if you like classic rock radio, many of your favorites are here. I'm not really a fan of that kind of music, but some of it was appealing.It's not a masterpiece but if you just want to laugh and don't have any expectations, and you can handle really sick humor, this just might work.

It should be appreciated, more! This divine comedy was really funny and very uplifting. Directed by Emile Ardolino, Sister Act tells the story of a Reno lounge singer, Delores Wilson AKA Delores Van Cartier (Whoopi Goldberg) who has been put under protective custody in a San Francisco church convent, due to being a witness to a murder, committed by mobster\/ex-boyfriend, Vince LaRocca (Harvey Keitel). While, in hiding, living under the name, Sister Mary Clarence. She has a hard time, fitting in, with the strict rule set of the Church. It wasn't until, she was force to help the struggling church choir to make some needed improvements that she sees the errors of her sinful ways; while also showing the church, that a little fun and freedom, isn't so bad. Without spoiling the movie, too movie, I have to say, the movie features some really good musical arrangements by song writer, Marc Shaiman. I like how, he was able to change old church hymns and classic R&B hits, into something new, by mixing them. A normal rendition like 'My Guy' by Mary Wells, transform into a cool faux-gospel number, when the movie substitutes My Guy with My God. Another great example is making the boring, Salve Regina gospel into a rock & roll-infused version of the song. It was perfect and so hip. My favorite song has to be 'I will follow him', the Little Peggy March cover. It really match, with the tone of the film, so well. This movie showed that worship can honestly, be awesome! All churches should do this. My only complaint is that the movie church choir didn't sing enough songs- it takes 30 minutes into the film, until Dolores finally get to teach the church choir, and a few minutes, more, until they start to sing. That sub-plot is the bread and butter, for this movie and seeing it, lag, behind, is a bit disappointing. I really didn't like the pacing for this film. The movie should had focus on the singing, a lot, more. I also hate misused of certain Mo-Town hits. Songs like (Love Is Like a) Heat Wave are introduce in the beginning in the film like the other songs, but this is the only classic R&B song that doesn't get the gospel treatment, later on. So it makes me, wonder, why the song was even there in the first place. I have a feeling, that the song did have a church choir version, but it was delete from the film. Another thing, I really didn't like, is the Animal House style, end credits. The movie's end credit kinda ruin the film's message. It shows that Delores didn't change much. As much as the ending, hurts the writing. I'm surprise, how well-done the script was. As production commenced, the script was rewritten by a half dozen screenwriters, including famous names, like Carrie Fisher, Robert Harling, and others, helping the product. Some people believe it was written, too well. Most of these critics claim that most of the story was stolen from books such as The Harlem Street Nun, an autobiography and 'A Nun in the Closet'. Despite that, I love the fish out of water conflict between old school traditional ways being challenge by new school approach. I love the clever funny jokes like the Blue Brothers cameo. None of the jokes, seem too blasphemous or offensive to the faithful. For the most part, it makes you want to rejoice along with the rest of the choir, and their enthusiasm feels very infectious. It's a lot of fun and makes you feel good in the process. I got the habit of laughing. However, the whole nun to rescue, third act was a bit over the top. I will have nun of that. When the script was brought up to Disney, they wanted actress Bette Midler for the main role. However, Midler turned down the role, fearing that her fans would not want to see her play a nun. While, I agree that real life singer and comedian, Bette Midler would make a great Delores. I have to say, the film's replacement, Whoopi Goldberg wasn't that bad. It's arguably Whoopi Goldberg's best role ever, besides 1990's Ghost. Still, there were some jarring issues about her performance. I really couldn't buy into her being a beautiful lounge singer. While, she did indeed could sing in real life. She doesn't have the musical presence that Midler has. The movie doesn't really showcase, Goldberg's singing ability that well. The whole music sequence, she did in the beginning, was kinda rushed, and felt more, like a comedy act, than a music act. Her verbal sparring with Mother Superior (Maggie Smith) was her strong suit. I love the exchange, between them. Remind me, so much of 1940 film Brother Orchid. Maggie Smith manages to inject a great deal of much needed depth into her thinly written character. The other characters in the film, are somewhat one-dimensional stereotypes, but they work. I love the joy that Kathy Najimy's is able to bring as the perpetually optimistic Sister Mary Patrick. She just shines with her sunny disposition. Wendy Makkena as the shy Mary Roberts who finds her voice is amazing to watch as well. She is so cute. Mary Wickes also puts in a good appearance as the stern Sister Mary Lazarus. She gets a lot of great one liners, and her timing is spot on. Even the villains weren't that bad. Harvey Keitel is passable, but his part feels inconsequential when compared to the others. Overall While, the movie is a bit predictable, and often full of musical clichés. It does have some charm. Bless you movie. Bless you. The film was followed by a 1993 sequel, Sister Act 2 Back in the Habit. Check it out, as well, if you want to.

The whole music sequence, she did in the beginning, was kinda rushed, and felt more, like a comedy act, than a music act. Her verbal sparring with Mother Superior (Maggie Smith) was her strong suit. I love the exchange, between them. Remind me, so much of 1940 film Brother Orchid. Maggie Smith manages to inject a great deal of much needed depth into her thinly written character. The other characters in the film, are somewhat one-dimensional stereotypes, but they work. I love the joy that Kathy Najimy's is able to bring as the perpetually optimistic Sister Mary Patrick. She just shines with her sunny disposition. Wendy Makkena as the shy Mary Roberts who finds her voice is amazing to watch as well. She is so cute. Mary Wickes also puts in a good appearance as the stern Sister Mary Lazarus. She gets a lot of great one liners, and her timing is spot on. Even the villains weren't that bad. Harvey Keitel is passable, but his part feels inconsequential when compared to the others. Overall While, the movie is a bit predictable, and often full of musical clichés. It does have some charm. Bless you movie. Bless you. The film was followed by a 1993 sequel, Sister Act 2 Back in the Habit. Check it out, as well, if you want to.

Police Capt. Quinlan is desperate, because for the first time in his 30-year career, he could be called out for framing an innocent man for murder. Also in the squalid room is drug kingpin Joe Grandi (Akim Tamiroff) -- all tough and threatening when he's got Susan cornered in his lair, but trembling and stammering when he can't guess what Quinlan's gonna do next. R-r-r-ripppppppppppppp. There goes a piece of Uncle Joe's shirt. What the blazes is going down here?! This is an incredibly dark and grim film. At times I questioned whether it was really entertainment. But I was glued to the screen. Here we have a portrayal of man as spineless, sniveling beast. Welles is leaden, limping, chewing, sneering, and oblivious to what anyone says, does, or thinks. Except, perhaps, the fortune teller Tana, played with incredibly dusky allure by a cigar-sucking Marlene Dietrich. Her tete a tete with Quinlan, over an empty pot of chili, truly smolders.The tilt and float camera work displayed as Touch of Evil opens is both dizzying and lulling. How seamlessly the director conjures an illusion of a vibrant place and time -- only to gut that when a car explodes and newlyweds Mike Vargas (Charleton Heston) and Susan disastrously part ways.Heston is great here as Quinlan's South of the Border alter ego -- but the Mexican cop is a man of integrity, someone who strives to do right when everything around him is putrifying. (Police work is only easy in a police state, he tells the sneering Quinlan.) When Quinlan excoriates the straight-arrow types who think killers should go free in deference to finer points of the law, he speaks for fascists everywhere.I'd like to go back to watching the rest of this film, and I know I will and must. However, for now, I am truly too fearful to do so. Dread and paranoia infect the viewer watching a morally vapid Quinlan alone with the unconscious Susan. One absorbs her vulnerability. CODA Well, I got the courage and went back. That bedroom scene is quite a crescendo! This movie resolves in an incredibly dramatic and moving way. But this is no purely happy ending. In the end we are left feeling somewhat hopeless about the sturm and drang of life. Sure, the good guys will try to make things better. But life is so very, very short.

He works at an antique shop with a man named Captain Manzini, a man with magical abilities. Dodger discovers seven creatures known as the Garbage Pail Kids. Dodger falls in love with Tangerine after she comes into the shop, and then takes him to a night club. Meanwhile, the Kids just cause random havoc for no reason at all. Dodger returns back to the Kids at the antique shop and they give him a jacket they sewed and it impress Tangerine. Tangerine asks Dodger to get more clothes so that she can sell them and have a fashion show to show them off. The Kids cause more havoc by going to a theater that plays Three Stooges shorts and behave obnoxiously. Two of them go to and start a fight at, The Toughest Bar in the World, and get free drinks. They steal a sewing machine while singing a song about working together to help make more clothes for Dodger. Tangerine finds out about the kids and is repulsed by them. She goes so far as to have Juice and her gang take them to, The State Home for the Ugly, where ugly people are caught and killed for being to ugly for society. Tangerine even betrays Dodger showing him that her heart still belongs to Juice. Captain Manzini frees the Kids and they head to the fashion show to ruin it. Dodger fights Juice and the models are stripped from the clothes they're wearing. Later, Tangerine apologizes to Dodger and asks him to be his friend, but Dodger refuses. Finally, Dodger and Captain Manzini try to sing a song backwards to get rid of the Kids, but the magic backfires, and the Kids ride into the night to cause more havoc. That's the film. If anyone is reading this, I spared moments of your life that you can use to do better things with than to watch this movie. Trust me, you're not missing out on anything. I have only seen other reviews on this film, plus Nostalgia Critic's review on it and believe me when I say that it's enough to convince me. He was right. Bad directing, writing, acting, pacing, atmosphere, technical production set-up, and music, with no story, character, plot, enjoyment, humor, charm, good visuals designs, good impact, believability, likability, re-watch value, effort, or anything. Nothing in this film makes any sense. We don't know where the Kids came from or even what they are, making the floating space ship scene in outer space in the beginning of the film pointless. Nothing is even fun to look at, including all the bad 1980's fashion that just makes the characters look ridiculous. Every shot in this movie is shot very dark, which kind of symbolizes this film in general. The moral this movie (if it even has one) is that there is no such thing as ugly, but this film is that it does the exact opposite of what it's trying to preach to kids. None of the characters are likable, especially the Kids. One has a pocket knife, another feeds off of human toes, and one pees his pants a lot. On top of that their mouths never fully close, making them look creepy. The State Home for the Ugly has Gandhi for being too bald, Abraham Lincoln for being too skinny, Santa Claus for being too fat, a clown for being too silly, and even five innocent guys for being too old, weird, hairy, pale, and crippled. Wow, this film is every definition of the word ugly and has convinced me that there is ugly in this world. It's surprising that this was the last film by director Rod Amateau, it's even more surprising that this film isn't number one on the bottom 100 movies of the IMDb, and it didn't get a single Razzie award. This mean, rotten, ugly, dark, cruel, and harsh film is like being a kid, getting kidnapped, getting put in a dark and scary chamber, then getting tortured, molested, and raped, all while being recorded live on the deep web, having to kill the people who did it, walking out of the chamber traumatized into the sunlight, realizing no matter what good thing happens to you now, it will never heal the scars that you experienced. They will always be there, forever. It's just pure torture to anyone, and it's a kids film, too! Kids, anybody, even I could make a better film than this. If anyone says to you that they have seen the worst movie ever and it's not this, immediately tell that person is wrong. This is the Holocaust of cinema and even worse than Manos. I even watched that movie. Yeah, Manos is bad, but it had it's excuses. GPK had a budget and was for kids, while Manos didn't have a budget and wasn't for kids. Just because this movie was a card game doesn't mean this film was doomed to fail from the start. It could have been possible to pull at least something out of the water with a concept like making a trading card game into a movie. Pokemon had trading cards and it succeeded. So, don't tell me that. I mean sure it wouldn't have been Oscar worthy, but at least there would have been something salvageable to be found in this film. Sadly, this film has nothing salvageable. Nothing! Don't watch this movie if you plan on eating, if you are eating, if you have eaten, if you don't want to lose your IQ, if you don't want to lose all faith in humanity, or if you want to keep your soul.

Jim Caviezel plays a cop and Dennis Quaid plays his father who died in a fire in 1969. Quaid burns a cigarette out on his desk and Caviezel can see its effect in his future time. This is never explained other than via ham handed electrical surge that is never convincing. Quaid survives the fire because Caviezel warned him. Now he instructs his father in preventing his mother's murder. Overwhelming while conclusion leaves more questions than answers. The happy ending bit doesn't work because it leaves the notion that past mistakes can be eliminated even though they have been committed. This also affects the credibility of characters played by Caviezel and Quaid who are pitted into territory that the screenwriter never examines.

Denzel Washington stars as a prison inmate given opportunity to reduce his sentence after an incident that killed his wife in front of his two children. His oldest son Jesus became a pro basketball player to support his family. Great concept driven to formula and a useless subplot regarding a prostitute whom Washington assists. Another problem is the name Jesus regarded with inappropriate humour. Spike Lee continues his portrayals of the black community. He previously made such films as Malcolm X, Crooklyn and Jungle Fever. Here he must rely on his lead to carry it. Washington deserves credit as he attempts to mend his past and reach his son. Aside from that this film is all downhill. Milla Jovovich as the prostitute could have been left out. It does nothing for the film other this cast an attractive female in the film. Also appearing are Hill Harper and Ned Beatty in cardboard roles. Ray Allen is given the name Jesus, which comes across as a distasteful distraction pending on one's beliefs. He is Washington's star playing son. Fine theme regarding talents and redemption that unfortunately doesn't match Lee's usual work.
