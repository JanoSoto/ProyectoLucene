But I still don't exactly see why.  The series itself is formulaic so calling this one dumber than the other films wouldn't make much sense.  The root of the problem everyone seems to have is that Jason isn't the killer.  That's not necessarily a bad thing at all, if you ask me, and considering that the original Friday the 13th didn't feature Jason Voorhees, either, I further don't understand series fans' distate for this movie.A New Beginning takes place several years after the events that occurred in The Final Chapter, with Tommy Jarvis (John Shepherd) as a teen and mentally disturbed after his encounter with Jason.  Because of this, he's been put in a halfway house for slightly mentally disturbed teens in some backwoods area.  We never actually find out what happened to his sister, whether or not she's in a similar condition or just occasionally visits him and it would have been interesting had her name been mentioned once or twice.Anyway, one of the teens, a fat kid named Joey, is brutally murdered by another fairly psychotic one.  Soon afterward, more murders begin to pop up, leaving the police baffled.  You'd think that all the people living in that halfway house would be a little scared, but it seems like they were never even informed of the murders that took place not too far from them.  Not exactly a very efficient police force, if you ask me.  Eventually, the murders reach that house which leads to the revelation of the identity of the man behind the hockey mask.It seemed pretty obvious that there was absolutely no chance that The Final Chapter would be the last installment, so it's nice to see that A New Beginning is actually not bad and can be considered decent, as far as slasher flicks go.  There's nothing particularly clever or intelligent about this movie, but it delivers some good visceral shocks and a few semi-unexpected moments.  The death scenes aren't very creative, but they are built up to with a good sense of dread.Director Danny Steinmann adds nothing new to the series but he handles the slash-and-stalk sequences fairly well, and there are a handful of suspenseful moments in the movie.  As is typical of all the Friday the 13th films, the movie builds up with individual murders that leads to the long chase finale with Jason stalking our heroine, played by Melanie Kinnaman. Once again, up to this point in the series, this is the fourth time they've done this, but Steinmann still delivers the goods in this sequence.  He also delivers a fairly chilling final scene, which was actually negated by Part VI Jason Lives.After Tom Savini's superb and numerous gore effects in The Final Chapter, you would think whoever did the make-up job here would try to outdo it, but there's not even a real attempt to do so.  Compared to that previous installment, this one's not as bloody and the effects aren't as good, either.  But overall, the make-up effects are acceptable and there are some gruesome death scenes, such as the (unintentionally) hilarious death one guy gets when his head is crushed with a vise against a tree.  There's also a good bit of nudity in this movie, with a lot of series fans clamoring over actress Debisue Voorhees nude scene in the woods, which is a bit more explicit than the usual mainstream nude scene.  Thus, it seems that to a certain extent, A New Beginning pretty much fulfills what was expected out of it.But there are still quite a numerous amount of flaws.  Though obviously played for humor, the redneck mother-and-son produce zero laughs and had me begging for nothing short of some gory evisceration for their fates. There's also a kid in this movie, like the previous film, but I really don't see what purpose he serves here at all.  He's not annoying, but it's a little too obvious that the director won't take the chance to kill him off, which is detrimental in a few scenes that are meant to get our hearts pounding.There's one part in this movie that I still don't know what to think of. It had me laughing my head off, though I'm really not sure if that was the intended effect or not.  Basically, at one point in the movie, we're introduced to this unshaven and rather dirty-looking mysterious man who stops by the redneck mother's house looking for work.  It's obvious he's made to be a suspect and at this one moment, we see him for all of 20 or so seconds.  Then his next appearance occurs when he spies on two teens having sex, in a POV shot that further wants us to think he's Jason.  Then, the camera focuses on his face for a brief second, and shows him getting stabbed by the actual Jason!  It's been awhile since I've seen this a character this useless.I didn't mind the fact that the killer wasn't the actual Jason Voorhees, but the plot twist at the end is mind-bogglingly dumb (but to be fair, I have seen worst twists in other slashers).  This revelation of Jason's identity and the reasons why he's doing all these murders is convoluted and way too convenient, to say the least. (Moderate spoiler here) Plus, in some ways, it's a semi-cheat since we only see this character for a brief moment or two in the actual course of the film.The other major problem is that Tommy Jarvis is played in an ambiguous manner, and we're supposed to think that he could be a possible suspect. While I appreciate the attempt to up the ante of suspense, it's a mistake because there's not really anyone else to get behind, except for Kinnaman, but I didn't actual notice her doing much in the film at all until the halfway mark.Since Part 4, the acting has generally improved in the series from the first 3, which is also the case with A New Beginning.  While those who play the mentally disturbed teens are mostly bad,  John Shepherd is decent as the disturbed Tommy Jarvis, playing his character in what I assume must be a fairly realistic manner.  Melanie Kinnaman as Pam is not bad.  Up to this point in the series, she's the second best of the Friday the 13th heroine's (which really doesn't say that much since the competition includes such awful actresses as Adrienne King and Amy Steel), behind Kimberly Beck from The Final Chapter, who herself ranks behind Lar Park Lincoln from A New Blood (and maybe Kari Keegan from Jason Goes to Hell, which I'll have to give another look to determine).Overall, I had fun watching A New Beginning and I probably liked slightly more things about it than I disliked.  In the end, it is still a typical slasher, but one that's certainly underappreciated (when compared with the many fans of the first 3 Friday the 13th's) and one I would recommend to fans of the subgenre.

","genre":"Horror, Mystery, Thriller"},{"date":"5 October 2001","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":"  ** out of ****Judging from all the negative comments over Friday the 13th A New Beginning, it's obvious that this is probably the most hated in the nine film series.  But I still don't exactly see why.  The series itself is formulaic so calling this one dumber than the other films wouldn't make much sense.  The root of the problem everyone seems to have is that Jason isn't the killer.  That's not necessarily a bad thing at all, if you ask me, and considering that the original Friday the 13th didn't feature Jason Voorhees, either, I further don't understand series fans' distate for this movie.A New Beginning takes place several years after the events that occurred in The Final Chapter, with Tommy Jarvis (John Shepherd) as a teen and mentally disturbed after his encounter with Jason.  Because of this, he's been put in a halfway house for slightly mentally disturbed teens in some backwoods area.  We never actually find out what happened to his sister, whether or not she's in a similar condition or just occasionally visits him and it would have been interesting had her name been mentioned once or twice.Anyway, one of the teens, a fat kid named Joey, is brutally murdered by another fairly psychotic one.  Soon afterward, more murders begin to pop up, leaving the police baffled.  You'd think that all the people living in that halfway house would be a little scared, but it seems like they were never even informed of the murders that took place not too far from them.  Not exactly a very efficient police force, if you ask me.  Eventually, the murders reach that house which leads to the revelation of the identity of the man behind the hockey mask.It seemed pretty obvious that there was absolutely no chance that The Final Chapter would be the last installment, so it's nice to see that A New Beginning is actually not bad and can be considered decent, as far as slasher flicks go.  There's nothing particularly clever or intelligent about this movie, but it delivers some good visceral shocks and a few semi-unexpected moments.  The death scenes aren't very creative, but they are built up to with a good sense of dread.Director Danny Steinmann adds nothing new to the series but he handles the slash-and-stalk sequences fairly well, and there are a handful of suspenseful moments in the movie.  As is typical of all the Friday the 13th films, the movie builds up with individual murders that leads to the long chase finale with Jason stalking our heroine, played by Melanie Kinnaman. Once again, up to this point in the series, this is the fourth time they've done this, but Steinmann still delivers the goods in this sequence.  He also delivers a fairly chilling final scene, which was actually negated by Part VI Jason Lives.After Tom Savini's superb and numerous gore effects in The Final Chapter, you would think whoever did the make-up job here would try to outdo it, but there's not even a real attempt to do so.  Compared to that previous installment, this one's not as bloody and the effects aren't as good, either.  But overall, the make-up effects are acceptable and there are some gruesome death scenes, such as the (unintentionally) hilarious death one guy gets when his head is crushed with a vise against a tree.  There's also a good bit of nudity in this movie, with a lot of series fans clamoring over actress Debisue Voorhees nude scene in the woods, which is a bit more explicit than the usual mainstream nude scene.  Thus, it seems that to a certain extent, A New Beginning pretty much fulfills what was expected out of it.But there are still quite a numerous amount of flaws.  Though obviously played for humor, the redneck mother-and-son produce zero laughs and had me begging for nothing short of some gory evisceration for their fates. There's also a kid in this movie, like the previous film, but I really don't see what purpose he serves here at all.  He's not annoying, but it's a little too obvious that the director won't take the chance to kill him off, which is detrimental in a few scenes that are meant to get our hearts pounding.There's one part in this movie that I still don't know what to think of. It had me laughing my head off, though I'm really not sure if that was the intended effect or not.  Basically, at one point in the movie, we're introduced to this unshaven and rather dirty-looking mysterious man who stops by the redneck mother's house looking for work.  It's obvious he's made to be a suspect and at this one moment, we see him for all of 20 or so seconds.  Then his next appearance occurs when he spies on two teens having sex, in a POV shot that further wants us to think he's Jason.  Then, the camera focuses on his face for a brief second, and shows him getting stabbed by the actual Jason!

The rest of the film is a strange mixture of scenes successfully extended to give more insight into the characters, or the excellent dissolve montage at the beginning with the ceiling fan, the stealing of Colonel Kilgore's surfing board, the expansion of Kurtz's dialogue near the end where he comes in and out of shadows, but gone is the tight and to the point editing that turned this river journey from a terrifying and gripping nightmare into a milk run or travelogue more suited for the Discovery or History Channels. They should have followed Willard's advice after the tiger incident don't ever get off the boat again. One scene in special comes to mind the one where they open fire on the innocent Vietnamese on the boat that they meet in the river. In the original version this scene came at a moment that the tension in the film was so high that the gunner's reaction was totally motivated and came about as a release to the nervous tension that had everyone in the boat on the edge of insanity. In the new version the killing becomes just a senseless massacre without any motivation at all. And there are many other instances just like it, but hard to pin down from seeing this version only once. Also, the absence of the original ending is a big disappointment. Anyhow, it is sad to see that even with 22 years of hindsight, Coppola still doesn't have the necessary objectivity to manipulate his material again. A prettier, larger package doesn't necessarily make a better film. ","genre":"Drama, War"},{"date":"5 October 2001","score":"","review":"  Ok, I watched this film yesterday. It was bad, really bad.

I had quite a bit of fun watching parts 4, 7, and 9, which were all quite entertaining, if not necessarily what good films (I have yet to see part 6, but many have claimed it's the best in the series).  But to be honest, I never really did care much for the original Friday the 13th, and this sequel is worse.  Yeah, I realize it's nothing more than a slasher, but even on that level it doesn't particularly succeed.I did like how the movie began.  Featuring Alice, the survivor from the original, director Steve Miner sets up a fairly tense and suspenseful 5-minutes sequence that caps off with her death.  Not a bad beginning, I thought.  Oh, man, it was only downhill from there.  The rest of the film basically involves some young adults setting up a camp near Crystal Lake, get horny and have sex (or try to), and be completely oblivious to the fact that there's a madman stalking and slashing them down.  It may sound like fun, but it sure as hell isn't.Despite a decent setting, some okay atmosphere, and a creepy score that might have been the inspiration for Ennio Morricone's score in The Thing (I'm not referring to the chu, chu, chu chorus),  Part 2 is damned boring.  After the decent opening, the movie just becomes long and tiresome, featuring one kill after another, none of which provide even a visceral thrill or shock.  The movie doesn't even gain any momentum once Jason starts chasing our heroine, played by Amy Steel, around. Miner simply shows that he doesn't really know how to set up a good slash-and-stalk sequence.  Some of these scenes are too easily telegraphed and they didn't even make me jump in my seat, with maybe the exception of one sole moment where a guy suddenly gets a machete thrown into his head.  The movie overall fails to create thrills, maybe because Jason acts more like a goofball than a frightening killer.  By that, I mean he wears a pillow over his head and always conveniently can't seem to stab Miss Steel despite so many numerous opportunities.To be somewhat fair to Miner, this is his directorial debut.  However, he may be considered a horror veteran now, and after having seen H2O and Lake Placid, I'm not eager to see his next film.  It's obvious that he wants to play Part 2 straight and scare the living daylights out of his audience, but many of his decisions are unwise, and everything looks cheesier than scary.Ron Kurz's script is incredibly routine and unimaginative.  He basically rehashes the original, and the only difference is that he has a different killer.  I know screenwriting isn't this subgenre's strong attribute, but come on, as a sequel to a box office smash, I'd like to think that the filmmakers would want to do more than just look like unimaginative losers.As usual, there's gore and nudity here, which are almost always good things to have in a slasher.  But the gore here is relatively tame when compared to some of the later entires.  Plus, only one girl gets nude (she's also the only really hot one in the film) while everyone else just takes a shirt off or shows off a lot of cleavage.  These same people also show no acting abilit whatsoever.  Amy Steel makes for a boring heroine, probably on the complete opposite side of the spectrum from Lar Park Lincoln's strong heroine from Part VII, the New Blood (And hey, Lincoln could actually act).The finale is confusingly filmed (There will be heavy spoilers here).  It features Miss Steel and the actor playing her boyfriend, I think his name's John Furey, arriving at the camp.  All of a sudden, they're attacked by Jason and it looks like the boyfriend is killed.  Then Jason starts chasing Miss Steel around.  From out of nowhere, the boyfriend returns, seemingly unscathed, and comes to the rescue.  Then, there's that random scene in the finale where Jason pops through the window, grabbing Steel.  Right afterward, the scene skips to the next day, where she is unhurt and her boyfriend's missing.  Then it ends.  Huh?Well, as you can gather, I don't like Part 2, but the series did continuously improve and try different things from here on out, with the later installments generally featuring better acting, more gore, laughs, and of course, nudity.  I don't know, Part 2 has a rather large fanbase and I've never understood its popularity.  It's nothing more than a boring slasher flick that's too lazily made to work.

The Makeup on Gary Oldman (Verger) was award-winning...How disturbing, macabre and scary.  This plot heavy movie crammed so much in, I feel it takes away from the beauty of the first film.  So much is thrown at us, we don't have time to digest it all.  The ending, while disturbing, was not the gross-out that I had heard it was.  Yes, it was digusting, but nothing I haven't seen before in movies.  As we all know, this does open up for another sequel, but I don't see that happening.  The series would become just another Hollywood product, probably getting yet another actress to play Clarice....JODIE, where are you?Overall, it was not a bad film, but lacked alot of the suspense the first one had.   Silly and Over the top at times, it is still shoot beautifully.  I am going to read the book, only because I do not think this movie did it justice.7 out of 10 ","genre":"Crime, Drama, Thriller"},{"date":"5 October 2001","score":"","review":"  It is unfortunate that for whatever reason, Jodie Foster did not reprise her role as Clarice.  Juliann Moore did not do half the job Foster did in the 1st film.  Hopkins as Hannibal was still very eerie, but lacked that psychotic, mysterious side of himself, and was way to obvious.Okay, while the scenes shot in Florence were breath-taking, I felt the movie spent too much time building story there.  I didn't complain too much...It was beautiful.  The photography of the whole movie was genius, and looked excellent.  At 2 hours 11 mins...This movie played on way too long.  I would have fallen asleep more than once if they would have kept the 35 mins of deleted scenes intact.  Yes, I did fall asleep...The beginning of the movie took so long to get going, I was losing interest.  The intensity of the first was just not in the one.

For almost thirty years now audiences have been captivated and intrigued by the Corleone family. And no other mafia movie has ever come as close to being this good. The story is just amazing and the directing by Francis Ford Coppola is nothing less than spectacular. Coppola has taken the concept of organized crime in America, something that was once looked down upon, and has built a cult following around it, with Marlon Brando and Al Pacino as their leading figures. And I don't think any single film has produced as many memorable scenes as The Godfather. Who could ever forget Marlon Brando, as Vito Corleone, buying those oranges on that fateful day? Or James Caan, as Sonny Corleone, getting massacred by the barrage of machine-gun bullets? And lines that will forever be repeated by fans like, I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse. The bottom line is that The Godfather has changed the way we look and judge films. It has made cool what is sinful, crime a family value, and dynamic characters the modern-day icons of several generations of storytelling in film. Alongside all the revolutionary pictures of all time, The Godfather earns it place at the very top. Whether it is the #3 greatest film by the American Film Institute, #1 by IMDb, or #2 by me, this movie should very well be agreed by all to be a landmark in American film history.
