I have watched it many times since and never tire of it. My reaction is why don't we get more films from Australia here? The humor that comes across during this tense time is what holds this film together. The acting is first rate from Sam Neil all the way down the line. The town of Parkes is proud to be part of the moon landing, but all in all takes it in stride.Tayler Kane as Rudy was a delight. When he thought that Neil Armstrong was actually on his walkie-talkie, I really laughed. The scene was priceless. Likewise Tom Long as Glenn, the computer expert played his role to perfection. When he jumps to take off his glasses whenever Janine comes into the facility is too much for words. The final bit of hilarity came when Mayor Bob asks everyone at the dance to remain upstanding for the American anthem, and the band breaks into the theme for Hawaii Five-O. The looks on the faces of the American ambassador and Patrick Warbourton are priceless. It doesn't get any better than that.Yet, the seriousness of the mission still comes across and the pride felt by the crew of the dish is readily visible. When it looks like the wind storm might take them out of the mission, you really feel for Cliff Buxton and his guys. You know he's going to go for it because he earlier said that This is science's chance to be daring. This is one movie I will never get tired of viewing. It is funny, it is serious, it is poignant, all without being mawkish or overly sentimental. Having lived through the entire U.S. space program (I was 21 when Apollo 11 landed), I know the excitement shown by the characters in the film as Apollo 11 first lifted off, and then when Armstrong came off the LEM and stepped onto the lunar surface. It was an exciting time and the final point of the movie that I enjoyed, was that this event affected many people outside the U.S. This is something that is often overlooked and it was great to see how the people of Parkes and in particular, the crew of the dish, helped bring the pictures from the moon to the rest of the world.

I think his Dumbland series is pretty much worthless, I think Mulholland Dr. is a numbingly 'over-directed' film whose content is simply too exaggerated and ridiculous to take seriously from any perspective, and I think he as a person -- while certainly having his charming whimsical moments -- is far too hoity-toity about his own work and doesn't give his fans enough credit for me to thoroughly respect him as an artist.

It is the perfect measure of his potential for crafting a lean, polished film that yields just the right balance of surreal and pragmatic content, and with just the right amount of subtle (and not-so-subtle) dark humor and entertainment devices to make it watchable in any number of mental states (passive, engaged, stoned, hung-over...).

And while the film unabashedly acknowledges its indebtedness to the conventions of the mystery genre, it completely subverts all of those conventions by assigning the role of detective to the audience (rather than to a character in the film), effectively making the clues cinematic (rather than concrete) in nature -- and thus the abstractions in the narrative become a way of paying homage to the genre rather than a way of deconstructing or criticizing it. As odd as it may sound, this film is most certainly a celebration of rather common cinematic conventions, as every last frame is crammed with them -- they're just deployed in a very surprising way, which is precisely where the film's brilliance lies.

I've seen countless films of his and have enjoyed him the most in every single one. In Wolf, he delivers a monologue that made me crack up and applaud. In the scene, he is sitting with Michelle Pfeiffer, who is giving him a hard time and maintaining the awkward discomfort she knows they're sharing. So he says, You know, I think I understand what kind of person you are now. You're very beautiful and you think men are only interested in you because you're beautiful. But, you want them to be interested in you because you're you. The problem is that aside from all that beauty, you're not very interesting. You're rude. You're hostile, sullen, withdrawn. I know you want someone to look past all that at the real person underneath but the only reason anyone would bother to look past all that is because you're beautiful. Ironic, isn't it? Aside from that line, Wolf isn't much.Mike Nichols is the gifted director of The Graduate, Primary Colors, Closer, and many others. He has always been terrific at drum-tight pace, telling cinematography, and drawing whirlwind performances from his actors. Wolf is a handful of mud spattered on his pearly white resume. If it were another director, maybe someone with a more modest body of work, then it wouldn't reflect that badly. But when Mike Nichols is using the blurry, startling slow motion that you would normally see in some Z-list direct-to-video thriller, not to mention other terribly campy techniques, and having a screaming, crying elk eaten by Jack, it's like Rembrandt painting stick figures.Ennio Morricone's score doesn't help matters. I think he really fell off during the 1990s. Possibly the greatest film composer of all time, his lesser scores are in a way infectious and moving, but they have some recurring part that is almost unbearable. His score for Wolf is a prime example. It has a slow, building drama in its orchestral sound, but the effect is interrupted, once again like mud on the sparkling surface, by a jittering synthesized sound reminiscent of the sounds made by the gadgets and gizmos in a mad scientist's lab on a really bad old sci-fi film.Christopher Plummer, another fine British actor whose American accent is impeccable, Michelle Pfeiffer, who plays herself and plays her well, and James Spader, a brilliantly drunk-with-pride villain, all add a little. Wolf is not a terrible movie, but by the standards it sets with its promising credentials, it's a breach.

(If you're gonna wolf, you better wolf fast\/ 'cause your old lady's got a face like a bulldog's Ask me no questions and I'll tell you no lies...) Having been brought up in the United States and having attended the public schools I am no stranger to the phenomenon of teenaged boys being teenaged boys, having been there and done that myself, including the hazy, sunny obligatory motor trip to Tijuana and points south. But what struck me while watching this fascinating film was how very like the guys I went to school with are Tenoch and Julio. In fact I was a little reminded of the song Me and Julio Down by the Schoolyard by Paul Simon. Not much would have to be changed to see this as an American movie about young people in America near the end of the 20th century.But this is about Mexico and it takes place in Mexico and even though Julio and Tenoch rag on Team America there is no doubt that their lives and the styles they copy and take as their own are enormously influenced by American culture, for better or for worse.Gael Garcia Bernal who previously starred in Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu's Amores perros (2000) plays Julio, who is from a middle class family. Diego Luna plays his friend Tenoch (named after Tenochtitlan, Aztec founder of Mexico City) who is the son of a prominent Mexican politician. Both boys live the kind of lives of plenty and privilege that the average Mexican can only dream about. And so there is a certain decadent and hedonistic quality to the way they embrace life. But what director Alfonso Cuaron captures with these boys and their adventure to an imaginary beach with an older woman is the zest of youth that throws itself wildly and madly into sex, drugs and the search for experience and the fulfillment of youthful urges. What they learn from Luisa (Maribel Verdu) is something most young men really lust after, that is, how to please a woman sexually--well, at least they experience a first course.Cuaron shows us teenaged boys as teenaged boys are raunchy, randy, irreverent, and as a old army sergeant used to say, young and dumb and full of... you-know-what. Well, not dumb. Both boys are sharp and quick to learn about life, and as the movie ends and they go their separate ways, we know that both will go on to college and make a good life for themselves. In this sense this is a coming of age movie with Lusia as mentor to the boys.Looking at the movie a little more deeply we have to ask, why does Lusia go on the trip with Tenoch and Julio, and why does she let herself go, so to speak? We learn that her husband has cheated on her (again, by the way) and had the temerity to call her up immediately after the fact and confess. Later we learn that she has an even more compelling reason to indulge herself in a youthful fling. (But of course you should see the movie to find out what that is.) The sense of freedom and naturalness that Cuaron captures, not only in the area of human sexuality, but in the spirit of a vast country moving from a largely agrarian society to an industrial one, and the bewilderment that such rapid change makes people feel, is made especially vivid by the focus on the young, since they are the ones moving the fastest. (Of course this focus doesn't hurt at the box office, since young people make up the bulk of viewers, in Mexico as elsewhere.)

Having been brought up in the United States and having attended the public schools I am no stranger to the phenomenon of teenaged boys being teenaged boys, having been there and done that myself, including the hazy, sunny obligatory motor trip to Tijuana and points south. But what struck me while watching this fascinating film was how very like the guys I went to school with are Tenoch and Julio. In fact I was a little reminded of the song Me and Julio Down by the Schoolyard by Paul Simon. Not much would have to be changed to see this as an American movie about young people in America near the end of the 20th century.But this is about Mexico and it takes place in Mexico and even though Julio and Tenoch rag on Team America there is no doubt that their lives and the styles they copy and take as their own are enormously influenced by American culture, for better or for worse.Gael Garcia Bernal who previously starred in Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu's Amores perros (2000) plays Julio, who is from a middle class family. Diego Luna plays his friend Tenoch (named after Tenochtitlan, Aztec founder of Mexico City) who is the son of a prominent Mexican politician. Both boys live the kind of lives of plenty and privilege that the average Mexican can only dream about. And so there is a certain decadent and hedonistic quality to the way they embrace life. But what director Alfonso Cuaron captures with these boys and their adventure to an imaginary beach with an older woman is the zest of youth that throws itself wildly and madly into sex, drugs and the search for experience and the fulfillment of youthful urges. What they learn from Luisa (Maribel Verdu) is something most young men really lust after, that is, how to please a woman sexually--well, at least they experience a first course.Cuaron shows us teenaged boys as teenaged boys are raunchy, randy, irreverent, and as a old army sergeant used to say, young and dumb and full of... you-know-what. Well, not dumb. Both boys are sharp and quick to learn about life, and as the movie ends and they go their separate ways, we know that both will go on to college and make a good life for themselves. In this sense this is a coming of age movie with Lusia as mentor to the boys.Looking at the movie a little more deeply we have to ask, why does Lusia go on the trip with Tenoch and Julio, and why does she let herself go, so to speak? We learn that her husband has cheated on her (again, by the way) and had the temerity to call her up immediately after the fact and confess. Later we learn that she has an even more compelling reason to indulge herself in a youthful fling. (But of course you should see the movie to find out what that is.)

I was fascinated then, and not even a military history buff as I am now. but over the years, I've come to appreciate an effort well-done. On the scaled of this film, to have built full-scale mockups of Nagato and Akagi and huge models of Arizona, Nevada, West Virginia, and all the rest is stupendous work and it really shows in the finished film. My comment, based on having seen that turkey Pearl Harbor which from this point on I shall refer to as PHew, one can really understand the difference between full scale models and CGI for special effects. Sure CGI can give filmmakers incredible abilities to create anything they want and make it do everything, but it's so obvious that CGI is used, it's very transparent and forgettable. The blowing up of USS Arizona in TTT was far and away more stunning and realistic than a computer-generated one in PHew. Remember 'Titanic?' A real, full-scale ship is what did the trick and made it come to life. PHew was a waste of film and money, and an insult to the men and women show survived and died that December day. As for the few shots of 'John Finn' the intrepid lone machine gunner who shot down a Zero and damaged others at Kaneohe Bay NAS, the depiction is a bit off. Finn wasn't behind a sandbag revetment, and he wasn't bandaged up during the fight. How do I know? John Finn is my neighbor, here in East County San Diego and I've talked with this fascinating old veteran many times. Even at over 96 years of age, he's sharp and interesting to talk to. He too, prefers TTT to PHew. BIG surprise. This film also shows a cautious, reluctant Admiral Kimmel (Martin Balsam) and acerbic General Walter Short (Jason Robards) as being unable to save their commands in the weeks prior to the attack. They had tried to be prepared, but failed to take the right action, despite their correct intentions. Washington's diplomats, politicians and senior military are depicted as being complacent and not taking the threat of Japanese aggression in the Pacific seriously. This is partially true, and FDR is said in some accounts to have been holding back on critical information which could have warned of the impending attack. History is still debating this. But the truth is, Kimmel and Short were made the scapegoats for the attack. They didn't deserve that fate, and I see them as casualties, just as the more than 1,200 other men and women killed that day. Soh Yamamura, who portrayed Isoroku Yamamoto, does a credible job of handling the role of a man who was targeted by US forces during the war as the leading villain in the attack.

I have to say I was disappointed. Godfather is basically a soap opera shortened to 3 hours.First, there's too much dialogue. Godfather's probably 10% action and 90% talk. It wouldn't been so bad if you could understand the conversations, but I found myself constantly missing out on something and having to rewind.

This conversation was one of the most important parts of the film, yet I heard nothing but mumblings.The jumbled storyline doesn't help either and not much makes sense.

I have never seen a movie that conveyed so much confusion to their audience.The acting was excellent though, but as one has already mentioned - lacked depth. Godfather had little character development and the characters do not have distinct personalities. I swear you couldn't tell Michael or Sonny apart. I think this was more the fault of the scriptwriters or director. Also the chemistry between Kay and Michael just wasn't there.

Miss Dench is very much the grande dame condescending to give the colonials a lesson in acting with an 'A' Now apparently comfortably ensconced as a ludicrously politically correct M in the Bond franchise she can presumably afford to cherry - pick her roles,a luxury she has not been able to afford in the past.Here she proclaims and emotes like an ageing RSC understudy for Lady Macbeth. Miss Blanchett plays the only sympathetic character in the movie,albeit an unbelievable one.Perhaps not exactly a hooker she is certainly an enthusiastic amateur,a free spirit not unlike the one played by Shirley Maclaine in Sweet Charity.Pregnant after a 3 minute fumble with Quoyle she marries him in a massively unlikely plot development and they have a daughter who definitely cramps her mummy's style. It is her death that sets the wheels in motion for her not entirely grief - stricken widower to return to his family roots with his daughter where the conveniently unspoken for Miss Moore awaits the arrival of her prince. That,more or less,give or take the odd bit of good old Newfoundland incest and murder is about it really. Having turned a funny and uplifting novel into a dull and depressing movie Hollywood then morphed a touching short story Brokeback Mountain into a full - scale full frontal epic of gay love which cleaned up at the box office.They will no doubt scour Ms Proulx's work for future production.If they decide to develop my favourite of her books Accordion Crimes I hope to God they don't let Mr Hallstrom get his hands on it.

Miss Dench is very much the grande dame condescending to give the colonials a lesson in acting with an 'A' Now apparently comfortably ensconced as a ludicrously politically correct M in the Bond franchise she can presumably afford to cherry - pick her roles,a luxury she has not been able to afford in the past.Here she proclaims and emotes like an ageing RSC understudy for Lady Macbeth. Miss Blanchett plays the only sympathetic character in the movie,albeit an unbelievable one.Perhaps not exactly a hooker she is certainly an enthusiastic amateur,a free spirit not unlike the one played by Shirley Maclaine in Sweet Charity.Pregnant after a 3 minute fumble with Quoyle she marries him in a massively unlikely plot development and they have a daughter who definitely cramps her mummy's style. It is her death that sets the wheels in motion for her not entirely grief - stricken widower to return to his family roots with his daughter where the conveniently unspoken for Miss Moore awaits the arrival of her prince. That,more or less,give or take the odd bit of good old Newfoundland incest and murder is about it really. Having turned a funny and uplifting novel into a dull and depressing movie Hollywood then morphed a touching short story Brokeback Mountain into a full - scale full frontal epic of gay love which cleaned up at the box office.They will no doubt scour Ms Proulx's work for future production.If they decide to develop my favourite of her books Accordion Crimes I hope to God they don't let Mr Hallstrom get his hands on it.

Lots of scenes are filled with interesting visual detailing. Story is gripping and complex. I have no clue about the book and games. This film is my only knowledge about 'Dune'. I found the film incomplete. I really thought that the film will talk about the people who are waiting for the messiah but film just talked about the 'Mujadeeb' aka Messiah. I don't know how it is in the book. Why messiah should come is more important than messiah himself. Minor detail maybe. Also it was weird that future messiah would say father I will seek revenge. That's not a messiah. It has to be a Hollywood hero.Special effects are dated but very good. Its good to have OK visuals with good story than having just sleek visuals. The biggest problem of the film is Kyle MacLachlan. He slept through it. Rest of the cast is good. Last twenty minutes are very slow and meaningless but rest is pretty good. 7\/10.

Whether or not you do, it should be easy to figure out that Fled is almost a total repeat of The Fugitive. It's another story of two guys chained together having to escape, all the while hating each other until they realize that they have to rely on each other; The Defiant Ones and Runaway Train did a much better job. This one, on the other hand, is basically a litany of car chases, explosions, etc. Laurence Fishburne has starred in far better movies, and even Stephen Baldwin appeared in The Usual Suspects; I can forgive Salma Hayek for starring in this, as it was early in her career.Anyway, it's not worth your time. Also starring Robert John Burke and Robert Hooks, and they probably don't wish to stress this in their resumes.

His stories are smuggled and printed bringing much excitement in France!I liked this movie mainly because of the 18th century French setting and the wonderful actors involved. While some other viewers point out the problem of having British accents in French roles, I too laughed at the idea as Hollywood seems to think everyone in Europe has British accents, but I do not think that hurts the movie.The movie stars Geoffrey Rush as the perverse Marquis. I had never heard of him at the time, but he does a wonderful, sickening Marquis. The Marquis was not actually insane some say he was ahead of his time a genius of misfortune. Most likely he was just a highly sexual soul who may have been misunderstood. His status of nobility probably hurt him since he is suppose to be a gentleman and gentleman are not such filth!Michael Caine, always impressive is the evil doctor sent to 'cure' the Marquis. Ironic how disgusting and perverse he finds the Marquis, since this esteemed doctor had a lovely child bride. A piece of information the Marquis has fun with during one of my favorite scenes where the asylum inmates act The Crimes of Love AMelia Warner portrays the beautiful convent education orphan Simone. Trapped in a gilded prison with a husband old enough to be her grandfather. She finds elation in one of the MArquis banned books. This leads to her elopement with the handsome Proix, the architect remodeling her home. AAhhh the crimes of love. Of course after learning of SImones departure with Proix and the existence of her guilty reading pleasure, the doctor knows exactly who to blame.Madeline is the tragic, free spirited, laundry girl. She is portrayed by Kate Winslet. She is a central character of this story as she is the one smuggling the stories and encouraging the Marquis. She also has a growing affection for the new priest who is running the asylum.Joaquin Phoenix, WHose name I have just learned to correctly pronounce, is a wonderful surprise as the sympathetic priest who is tested to the point of insanity himself.A truly marvelous movie, the workings of the everyday asylum and the quirky loonies in there are all entertaining.
