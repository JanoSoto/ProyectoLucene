Aside from some of Wood's more wretched offerings, such as Glen or Glenda, regarded by some critics as far more unwatchable than Plan 9 From Outer Space, Hollywood was ripe with many memorable celluloid fiascoes. Robot Monster, Santa Claus Conquers the Martians, and (my favorite) The Incredibly Strange Creatures Who Stopped Living and Became Mixed-Up Zombies are all cult classics of bad movie-making remembered for their combination of strangeness, silliness, and unwatchable-ness. None of these were produced by Wood and yet were made during the same era.The entire era from circa 1950 to 1970 had such nutty movies that if someone wrote a novel about it, no one would believe it! At the top of the heap is the oh-so-memorable Plan 9 From Outer Space, so ridiculously bad that it invites after-movie conversation much more than many movies being produced today. The bad sets, the bad dialog, the bad acting are still discussed today. No one discusses films which are merely mediocre. With Plan 9, schlock was elevated into its own category, probably the inspiration behind the Razzie Award. Plan 9 is the film by which all other schlock films are judged.Ed Wood with Johnny Depp in the title role chronicles the brief career of the one producer of movies who stands on a pedestal above the rest in the museum of cheesy film production where talent didn't quite get their footprints into the Chinese Theatre. If Barney Fife (the frantic deputy from the Andy Griffith Show) wrote and directed movies, the results might be of the Ed Wood variety. Wood's writing was filled with cliché, incomprehensible story lines, bad characterizations, and even worse stage direction.

I mean who else but Wood could come up with  I'll bet my badge that we haven't seen the last of those weirdies. or They've been like that all down through the ages. Especially in a spot like this. Pure Razzie genius. Tim Burton's homage to the era of schlock works on every level. Ironically, A-list acting talent plays some of the most borderline talent of the era who ended up in Woods' projects basically because they didn't fit in anywhere else. The Amazing Criswell a.k.a.

Johnny Depp, now just about as A-list as they come, plays Wood, and highest honors go to Martin Landau as the aging Bela Lugosi in a tour-de-force performance. Lugosi never could distance himself from Dracula, and Wood was the only filmmaker in town who still appreciated the Hungarian accent and his tuxedo.Shot in B&W, Ed Wood almost feels like a slightly better Ed Wood movie. The film concentrates on three of his most remembered projects, Glen or Glenda, Bride of the Monster (formerly Bride of the Atom), and his masterpiece Plan 9 From Outer Space.

The latest film is one she falls in love with and while watching it repeatedly she falls for its leading man Tom Baxter (Jeff Daniels) who eventually notices her in the crowd, walks off the screen and into her life. This doesn't sit too well with the woman's husband (Danny Aiello) or the actor who played Baxter on the screen (also played by Daniels). There's no doubt that Allen's screenplay has a nod to Buster Keaton's SHERLOCK JR., which features Keaton playing a movie nut who walks into the movie. As with that film, the level as writing is just so perfect that you really can't help but fall in love with the characters even if the story is so far-fetched that you could poke holes in how it plays out. The performances, direction and screenplay are so flawless that you can overlook what happens in the story because everyone makes you want to believe what's going on can really happen and I think Allen really does do a terrific job at expressing how a movie can make you forget your troubles and go off into a fantasy world. At just 82-minutes the movie is extremely fast-paced as the writer-director really doesn't waste any time getting us going and he perfectly tells us everything we need to know about the characters within the first ten-minutes. We meet Farrow, see her poor life and can understand what she gains from the movies. Even the Aiello character is perfectly written as is both roles played by Daniels. I won't ruin the ending but it's said that producers begged Allen to change it as they felt they'd have a major hit on their hands but thankfully Allen stuck to his guns. Again, I won't give anything away but the ending is one of the most perfect ever filmed and it says so much without having to resort to any lame dialogue. Farrow and Daniels are simply perfect together as their chemistry jumps off the screen at each second they're together. Daniels is really impressive as his has to play two parts and do them so differently. Aiello is also perfect as the jerk husband and Diane Weist is also quite good in her small part. Farrow easily steals the film in what has to be called one of her greatest performances if not her very best. I just really loved the wide-eyed nature Farrow brought to the part and especially some of the early scenes where she's in the theater falling in love with what she's seeing on the screen. I thought the actress did a remarkable job at making you feel for her character and you really do want to see her get out of the various troubles she's in. Allen's screenplay is certainly one of his most creative and while none of the laughs are as big as some might hope for, I think he does a marvelous job at getting all the magic in the film done right.

Since it's been about 35 years since Rocky premiered, I was waxing nostalgic about the film.It's so impressive now to remember that Stallone wrote the film, then went up against the Hollywood movie industry and got it made even though he had only been in a few previous movies prior to this. AND, he wouldn't sell it unless he was cast to play the title character, turning down offers even though he was broke and hungry at the time. He believed...and wouldn't compromise.So basically, as a kid, a novice in Hollywood, Sylvester Stallone created one of the true all- time classic American movies....a masterpiece that has grown even stronger over time....with an Academy Award, necessary or not, to add its official stamp of approval.Over the years of his career since them he has had many ups and downs. He's been the butt of jokes, always type-cast, let his celebrity status overshadow his movie roles. He's been grouped in with Schwarzenegger, Seagal, Van-Damme...just another cookie-cutter action- hero...and hey, he's chosen the roles that put him there. Nobody's ever compared him to Pacino, Spielberg, or any of the upper echelon of the Hollywood elite.But then there's Rocky. It'll probably never place higher than The Godfather on the all-time lists....never compare to Citizen Kane or Casablanca in film school discussions...or mentioned in conversations discussing Pulp Fiction or Schindler's List. But Rocky is the cinema equivalent of Tom Sawyer, The Grapes of Wrath, The Old Man and the Sea....a true American classic. His portrayal of the title character (which was probably more just being himself than acting) embodied what all us guys want to be. He was a guy who knew where he came from, he didn't have much, but what he had was yours if you needed it, he tried to guide those in his neighborhood down the right path, he remembered to always feed and care for his pet turtles, Cuff and Link...he was a street-tough that was sweet, kind and gentle. He was a friend to a guy, Paulie, who didn't deserve his friendship, and he fell in love with a woman and treated her as if she were a Queen. He knew he couldn't offer her much in the way of the material trappings of life, so he gave her what he could...himself, his heart and his unconditional love....He was humble in attitude, and gave respect to everyone, regardless of their position in life. Stallone wrote and portrayed the character that all us American guys hope and try to be. And when offered the chance to make a dream come true, Rocky Balboa accepted the challenge. The South Philly lunk put his American work ethic into achieving his goal...something all of us are...or want to believe we are...doing in our own lives.The hero doesn't win in the end, at least not on the scorecard...but his victory comes from knowing that he gave it his all...he didn't give up. So this is a movie that grabs your heart and shows you that if you believe that good things can happen...and if you just be true to yourself...that the journey is itself the victory, and the people we love and who love us are the real treasures in our lives. If you're not cheering at this movie, than you may not have a pulse...and you're definitely lacking a soul.When you're in one of those ruts where nothing seems to be going your way, when bad luck is your constant companion, and you're asking yourself, what's the use? Rocky will give you an encouraging pat on the shoulder, a firm kick in the butt, and let you know that you're not alone in your struggles.That a kid outta Hells Kitchen wrote the script, and nailed the lead role, is an underdog story in itself. No matter what Stallone has done since...or will do in the future....he created Rocky, one of the greatest American movies..and characters... .ever made. No one can ever take that from him.

Since it's been about 35 years since Rocky premiered, I was waxing nostalgic about the film.It's so impressive now to remember that Stallone wrote the film, then went up against the Hollywood movie industry and got it made even though he had only been in a few previous movies prior to this. AND, he wouldn't sell it unless he was cast to play the title character, turning down offers even though he was broke and hungry at the time. He believed...and wouldn't compromise.So basically, as a kid, a novice in Hollywood, Sylvester Stallone created one of the true all- time classic American movies....a masterpiece that has grown even stronger over time....with an Academy Award, necessary or not, to add its official stamp of approval.Over the years of his career since them he has had many ups and downs. He's been the butt of jokes, always type-cast, let his celebrity status overshadow his movie roles. He's been grouped in with Schwarzenegger, Seagal, Van-Damme...just another cookie-cutter action- hero...and hey, he's chosen the roles that put him there. Nobody's ever compared him to Pacino, Spielberg, or any of the upper echelon of the Hollywood elite.But then there's Rocky. It'll probably never place higher than The Godfather on the all-time lists....never compare to Citizen Kane or Casablanca in film school discussions...or mentioned in conversations discussing Pulp Fiction or Schindler's List. But Rocky is the cinema equivalent of Tom Sawyer, The Grapes of Wrath, The Old Man and the Sea....a true American classic. His portrayal of the title character (which was probably more just being himself than acting) embodied what all us guys want to be. He was a guy who knew where he came from, he didn't have much, but what he had was yours if you needed it, he tried to guide those in his neighborhood down the right path, he remembered to always feed and care for his pet turtles, Cuff and Link...he was a street-tough that was sweet, kind and gentle. He was a friend to a guy, Paulie, who didn't deserve his friendship, and he fell in love with a woman and treated her as if she were a Queen. He knew he couldn't offer her much in the way of the material trappings of life, so he gave her what he could...himself, his heart and his unconditional love....He was humble in attitude, and gave respect to everyone, regardless of their position in life. Stallone wrote and portrayed the character that all us American guys hope and try to be. And when offered the chance to make a dream come true, Rocky Balboa accepted the challenge. The South Philly lunk put his American work ethic into achieving his goal...something all of us are...or want to believe we are...doing in our own lives.The hero doesn't win in the end, at least not on the scorecard...but his victory comes from knowing that he gave it his all...he didn't give up. So this is a movie that grabs your heart and shows you that if you believe that good things can happen...and if you just be true to yourself...that the journey is itself the victory, and the people we love and who love us are the real treasures in our lives. If you're not cheering at this movie, than you may not have a pulse...and you're definitely lacking a soul.When you're in one of those ruts where nothing seems to be going your way, when bad luck is your constant companion, and you're asking yourself, what's the use? Rocky will give you an encouraging pat on the shoulder, a firm kick in the butt, and let you know that you're not alone in your struggles.That a kid outta Hells Kitchen wrote the script, and nailed the lead role, is an underdog story in itself. No matter what Stallone has done since...or will do in the future....he created Rocky, one of the greatest American movies..and characters... .ever made. No one can ever take that from him. So thank you Sylvester Stallone. I'm grateful for the gift of your movie.

Stanley Kubrick was truly one of those directors. He did science-fiction, drama, comedy, war movies, documentaries and basically everything else in between. With The Shining he delivered his only horror production, which is among his best movies. But then again; is there really truly such a thing as a bad Kubrick movie in the first place? Yes, if you haven't noticed, I'm a real Kubrick fan. Looking back at his career, he probably was the greatest director that ever lived and he delivered masterpieces over the course of 5 decades. Not a whole lot of directors can say that. But even more remarkable is that he always sustained his own style. Each and ever of his movies have the same feeling and approach to it, which isn't necessarily following all of the 'Hollywood-rules'. He always continued doing his own thing, which makes all of his movies very consistent with each other, as well as unique and originals ones, due to its uncommon approach.Also this movie really isn't a very typical horror movie. It's very slow in its build up, which at the same time is also the movie its biggest strength. If you have to compare this movie to anything else it probably would be Robert Wise's The Haunting, which features a sort of similar concept and build up and just like The Shining, was an unique and unusual horror movie for its time.Its slow build up ensures that the movie has a constant feeling of tension and danger looming over it. You never know when a person is going to snap or when something creepy will happen. It makes The Shining a real unsettling movie to watch, which is one of the biggest compliments you could give any horror movie.The approach and build up of the movie also ensures that this movie is true beautiful one to look at. The hotel and the eeriness of its emptiness and remoteness gets captured really well on film. They really found the perfect locations for this movie. The movie features some real great cinematography in it, especially the steadicam work really contributes to the movie its many great moments.The movie probably also features Jack Nicholson's most definitive role in it. Yes, he has played some truly great and memorable roles and characters over the years but his performance as Jack Torrance is probably his most recognizable and best known one. But also the very young Danny Lloyd was real great. He acts very natural and acts like a true kid of his age, which is something not a whole lot of horror movies are able to get right. All of the characters in this movie feel and behave very natural and also interact that way with each other. All of their relations feel real, which is also one of the powerful aspects of this movie.In my opinion a movie everyone should watch at least once in their lifetime.10\/10http\/\/bobafett1138.blogspot.com\/ ","genre":null},{"date":"9 July 2011","score":"1 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" What in my opinion makes truly a great director is a person who can direct different movies in different genres and make them all equally work out as great ones.

With To Be Or Not To Be, there was good news and bad news.

The bad news was it was released shortly after, in early 1942, when Americans, now facing the barrel of German weapons, did not find the Nazi menace so amusing.

No way. It doesn't need to be. It's got jokes that will fade with time, topical references and timely jabs, but overall it's just perky and funny top to bottom. And relentlessly. And yes, it pushes its point hard, about how we're all people and relationships are relationships, and that's where the comedy matters, making sure you don't take the delivery too seriously. If you have doubts that it's a farce with a silver lining, just wait until you see Gene Hackman at the end.You might argue that the social message is all that matters, and of course that's true to some ways of thinking (and in some camps of criticism), but that would limit the point of the whole affair.

And if you don't think the story has legs, there is a 1978 Italian version of the play (not the musical) on film. The advantage of the American version for American audiences is the references are still slightly recognizable (the Bob Dole comments are already seeming like history, however).Anyway, don't see this for Robin Williams.

","genre":"Comedy"},{"date":"9 July 2011","score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" The Birdcage (1996)Well, there is always something great about a Mike Nichols film, and this one, written and directed by Nichols, is no exception. It is however a story that has had better presentations (see below) and I'm not sure why Nichols opted for such an un-original material. The movie really is great in some ways, and has terrific moments, but it doesn't transcend, as the best Nichols films certainly do.Robin Williams, the apparent big name on the marquee, is the weakest link in the cast (not including the two young people, who are fine but routine). But the rest of the main actors, Nathan Lane as the drag queen most of all, but Gene Hackman as a conservative senator and Dianne Wiest as his wife, are an amazing ensemble. Throw in consistently funny and clever writing (a functioanl adaptation), good camera-work, obviously attractive sets (this is South Beach in Miami), and a lively soundtrack and you sort of can't go far wrong.Is it brilliant? No way. It doesn't need to be. It's got jokes that will fade with time, topical references and timely jabs, but overall it's just perky and funny top to bottom. And relentlessly. And yes, it pushes its point hard, about how we're all people and relationships are relationships, and that's where the comedy matters, making sure you don't take the delivery too seriously. If you have doubts that it's a farce with a silver lining, just wait until you see Gene Hackman at the end.You might argue that the social message is all that matters, and of course that's true to some ways of thinking (and in some camps of criticism), but that would limit the point of the whole affair. And as time goes on and people get more used to the idea of gay culture and gay people as just another aspect of life, well, the sensational aspects of the movie will water down. But that's fine. Besides being inevitable, it points to the other parts of the film, the Shakespearean cross-dressing, the play on identities, the constant repartee. It's funny and fun and yet smart, too. The plot, at its core, is an Americanized version of the original French play (from 1973) La Cage aux Folles (which means roughly Cage of Drag Queens if you take into account the slang for folles). And there is of course the famous two versions of the Broadway musical version (the 1983 and 2004 versions, not to mention the current one which started in 2010). It's a great story with a long life, clearly. And the playful interaction of the ensemble is perfect for the stage.Yet this isn't the play nor the musical, but the film, with a new name. And the photographic aspects are pretty wonderful, too. Take just the opening shot coming in on a helicopter over the water and seamlessly (almost, there's a frame or two glitch) gliding right into the night club, The Birdcage. And if you don't think the story has legs, there is a 1978 Italian version of the play (not the musical) on film. The advantage of the American version for American audiences is the references are still slightly recognizable (the Bob Dole comments are already seeming like history, however).Anyway, don't see this for Robin Williams. He's fine, but not the crackup fast talker that he's best at. And it isn't him, but Nathan Lane, who gets to cross-dress. Fabulously. You'll see.

This is one of the highest quality horror films you will ever see. It's got an intense story, riveting characters, and incredible actors. The film takes place years after Manhunter. Lecter is still behind bars and he is once again called upon to assist in tracking down a disturbed serial killer. This time it is young FBI agent Clarice Starling who is assigned to talk to Lecter and with his information track down Buffalo Bill, a serial killer who kills young women and then skins them. But once again there is only so much trust you can put into a cannibal, and Lecter complicates things while at the same time giving subtle and vague clues to Clarice that might help track down Buffalo Bill. This is one of the most disturbing and psychologically grotesque films ever to grace the world of cinema, but it is made so well and with such expertise that it becomes a work of art rather than exploitation.This is one of those films where every aspect falls into place so perfectly it is as if you are experiencing everything the characters are as it happens, rather than just watching this film unfold. Right off the bat the movie grabs you with its stern sincerity and you can immediately feel the tension that rises throughout the film. Through the beginning of the film we develop a perfect sense of the tension within the film and the dread within the characters. Then we reach Clarice's first meeting with Hannibal Lecter and the films true haunting intensity comes out. At that moment the film becomes a nightmare that grows darker and darker with each clue that leads Clarice closer to what she sees as the ultimate evil that she is going to face, Buffalo Bill. She doesn't even know that the true evil is Lecter himself, but he is behind bars misleads Clarice to think he isn't as threatening. We the audience of course know that he is a bigger threat than any Buffalo Bill, but somehow we forget this because we are so compelled to feel as Clarice, our innocent and tormented protagonist, feels. It is a sinister trick the film pulls on us because it works all too well.This film relies a lot on shock value, making us remember every last disturbing image we are forced to witness during it. This film engraves itself into your mind and there is no way to escape the horror elicited by it. This is a movie that tortures you and makes you feel more than you've probably ever felt during a horror film. And yet it isn't a movie that draws out fear through cheap thrills. Every horrifying image you witness is meaningful and furthers the plot, driving us through the terror straight ahead to the film's explosive conclusion. This movie is what I consider to be truly scary. It instills true fear rather than just frightened amusement. It is masterful in its suspense building and ingenious in the placement and moderation of its thrills. We see a lot of grotesque things in The Silence of the Lambs but there are still things we don't see that make it even scarier.Through its incredible script, excellent direction, and superb acting this film establishes itself as a masterpiece. What really makes this film is definitely Anthony Hopkins portrayal of Hannibal Lecter. It is so perfectly haunting in a calm and sedated kind of way. There is nothing over the top or ridiculous about his character or Hopkins performance. It is totally believable which makes it that much more disturbing. It is easily one of the best film performances ever and a huge part of what makes this film incredibly terrifying.I don't hesitate to call The Silence of the Lambs one of the scariest films ever made. Its tension and its suspense make it so terrifyingly gripping that once the film has a hold of you it doesn't let go. Few films can instill fear the way this film does. I have to commend it for actually scaring me while refraining from being an over the top film full of cheap thrills and easy scares. This film is a horror masterpiece.

There have been very few movies in this genre that I deem to be truly flawless. However, as much as it means to me to call a film a masterpiece, I don't hesitate when it comes to calling this particular film a masterpiece. First Blood is a milestone in action movie making that is equally suspenseful as it is emotional and a definitive moment for Sylvester Stallone's career.The plot goes as follows. John Rambo is an ex-Green Beret who travels the country visiting old friends from Vietnam. He goes to see one of his old comrades only to learn that he has passed away. With a bleak future ahead of him, Rambo goes into a small town and is immediately harassed by a local sheriff for being a drifter. He's arrested, escapes from the police station, goes into the woods and begins a one-man war with the police and national guard.With a plot like this, you'd expect it to be a bullet-fest with no real feeling, but instead it is an intense experience because of the audiences' emotional investment in the human story embedded within whilst the violence and body count is kept to an appropriate minimum (There's only one death and it's unintentional). First Blood is not about the action, it's all for suspense, character development and how viewers respond to it.The reason why the suspense works so well is because of how connected we feel to John Rambo. We witness his response to hearing about his friend's death, get a glimpse into the horrendous things that he experienced in the war and we see the unethical treatment of him at the hands of the corrupt cops. These effectively establish him as our protagonist and we really wish to see him succeed. The rest of the movie sees him put into a series of life threatening situations that we wanna see him overcome, but we aren't entirely sure. That's the genius.Sylvester Stallone gives a performance that is equally as phenomenal as his Rocky performance. Anyone who still wishes to discredit Sly really should examine these films before jumping to conclusion. He clearly is a talented actor. The greatest moment that Stallone gives us is a powerful monologue at the end in which Rambo releases all his built up thoughts. His cries all come out as being genuine. These dramatic moments are far more powerful than any sort of explosion or special effect.Outside of Stallone, I feel the need to give my compliments to Brian Dennehy and Richard Crenna. Their performances as Teasle and Colonel Trautman are very strong and they are great supporters of Stallone.The movie also has several other positive points. The pacing is perfect and the hour and a half running time doesn't come off as short nor does it drag. The atmosphere of every location is evident and reinforces the suspense. The music by Jerry Goldsmith is absolutely wonderful and contributes to both the suspense and emotional impact. Lastly, the overall direction of Ted Kotcheff rightfully should be commended.Whilst the series did lose its serious tone after this and just went for straight forward action, they are entertaining and they certainly don't hurt the true power of the original movie.First Blood is a movie that hits in all the right places and then some. It has earned it's place as an endlessly rewatchable action classic that is definitive of its genre. The fact that this is not in IMDb's Top 250 list is a crime.
