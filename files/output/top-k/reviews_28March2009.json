[{"date":"28 March 2009","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Stephen Soderburgh is one of a kind. I love his indie efforts of sex,lies, and videotape; Bubble; and in a strange way, Schizopolis. I like it when he develops characters, but I haven't seen a majority of his big films because I see him as an innovator and more of an indie film maker. Maybe I should. I don't know.With that intro out of the way, let me say that everyone in the film under the direction of Soderburgh -- Michael Douglas, Catherine-Zeta Jones, Don Cheadle, Luis Guzman, Benico Del Toro, the assassin guy -- everybody plays their part well and they act well -- but the issue is the war on drugs something we see only glimpses of on the news and in the streets (and, yes, in the labs and fields, etc.) I appreciate the effort of the film and its overall message that it this war is unstoppable and you take victories where you can get them. But the film, in all of its cool glory, never takes enough time to let us know these people, with the possible exception of Del Toro's cop.There's so much going on the color schemes, the characters representing a specific piece of the war (legislation, drug dealers, etc.) with a such a star-studded cast that we always see the actors and actresses on the screen rather than their characters. Del Toro's cop, Javier Rodreguez, is allowed to be fleshed out more than anyone else in the movie. We think he is a good man, than we wonder, then we realize that is again, and then we realize why he wants what he wants. In a movie with interlocking stories, color screens, and this and that, he is a human being to whom we can relate. The rest, even Douglas' performance, fail to move me as beyond stereotypical.I don't hate this film; I just think it was trying to do too much, and lost its emotional core, except for Del Toro. Like I said, good performances and good direction ... but like the real war on drugs, it doesn't add up to too much. Check out Requiem For A Dream for a better, intimate statement about this war.
