[{"date":"21 January 2013","score":"","review":" Elizabeth is one of my favourite films. Being an avid Tudor 'fan' I couldn't wait to see this when it first came out. Cate Blanchett gives a fantastic performance as the young Elizabeth who slowly evolves from an innocent girl to the Virgin Queen while also trying to keep Lord Robert happy. Obviously this film has changed some events to fit the story so don't watch it thinking it is historically accurate, as it isn't, but then it doesn't pretend to be. It isn't a documentary, it's a Hollywood film so of course things aren't to the letter. If they were the film would be around 8 hours long! i cant believe people have rated this film so low as I found it piqued my interest even further to learn more about this Queen and it had genuinely great moments provided by the great cast. Really well worth a watch. ","genre":null},{"date":"21 January 2013","score":"","review":" Elizabeth is one of my favourite films.
