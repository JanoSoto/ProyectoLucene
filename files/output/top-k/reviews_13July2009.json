I'm sure many believe this film is a piece of work, but what is the thrill? In Halloween, a six year old child named Michael Myers (Will Sandin) had the will power to murder his older sister on a Halloween night of 1963. The gruesome murder led the young psychotic Myers right into an asylum. A doctor by the name of Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasence) spent fifteen years with Myers trying to figure out the cause of evil within him. Unexplainably, the adult Myers (Tony Moran) escaped on the night before Halloween in 1978. His goal was to go back to where it all started in Haddonfield, Illinois, and search for his seventeen year old sister. Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) had no idea what evil was coming her way. Dr. Loomis seeks to stop the masked killer in his path, but Myers won't be stopped by anything. Like every good director of horror films, Carpenter created Halloween to be scary and suspenseful. The ultimate question is what makes Carpenter's Halloween scare his audience? The film is obviously the 70s style of movie making; with its cheesy script and beamy music in the background. We already know that those poor little teenagers had it coming, for no bad act goes unpunished and so their fornication led to their doom. If that scares you, you must be a newbie to horror films. You must dig deeper and understand that Carpenter makes you feel like you're in the movie; he has you peering into the screen checking to see if Myers is behind the door or if he's hidden in a dark corner. The main characters pretend that nothing is wrong, while the audience knows full well what's coming next. You'll find the horror in Carpenter's screenplay creeps up on you as much as Myers does throughout the movie. However, some areas in the film did not make sense at all. For instance, how does a psychotic killer escape from an asylum and learn how to drive the first time behind the wheel? The audience clearly knows Myers was away for fifteen years and an asylum does not offer driving lessons. Perhaps its maternal talent! If Myers was six years old entering the mental institution, he'd be twenty-one years old in 1978, not twenty-three as listed in the credits. Incredible explains Halloween, how could anyone forget those piercing eyes behind that mysterious mask or that theme song that puts the Halloween series together. This low budget film had a few mishaps, but in the end it was all still worth the fifty-five million.

It contains some kind of hidden message to us that we can not take our civilization for granted. What would happens if things would completely run out of control. Nuclear wars as a result of highly advanced modern civilization that ran out of control because it was led by moral idiots on all sides. Anarchy and social disintegration are result of that between those who survived self-destruction of civilization. All that is told through story of a man who becomes a victim of that madness.Max who is cop loses his family and this is the point of no return.He is no longer man of Law because community fell apart, and it is pointless to seek for justice through legal ways,because there are no longer institutions to enforce that justice,people are left on their own. So he becomes Revenger and enforces his own justice by killing those who killed his family.By the end of first movie he loses his humanity. In a second movie there is a story about brutal fight for limited resources left (in this case some oil).Only the strongest survive and take everything,mankind has been degraded to the lowest point of existence. Max is cold-blooded man living almost like an animal and fighting only for his interest. But there is still some humanity in him and he joins the weaker side in conflict. Fighting is ruthless as they try to escape with what they have. Eventually they fail, but neither other side gets what they wanted to take. Third movie is the crown of all story. Max rambles through a world that has returned to ancient standard of living and slavery of the people. As usually he gets in to a trouble with the most powerful person in the town Aunty (played by Tina Turner) but manages to escape in to a desert.She believes that he died from thirst and hunger and halts the search for him. Luckily he is found by some tribe and brought to their settlement. When he regains consciousness he weeks up surrounded by strange people. Living with them he slowly regains the person he used to be before all madness that made him title Mad Max began. He is a human again. There is an interesting scene in movie when he is brought to something that represents local attraction. They call it a sky-float, but it is actually a wreckage of a Boeing-747 aircraft partially covered by desert sand. Civilization no longer exists and terms of modern language are forgotten,so that tribe does not have word airplane, instead they use word sky-float. This is regression to prehistoric way of life. They want him to take them to a city from stories of their ancestors. He refuses that telling them that they can not make it to there and they should stay in their paradise. If they get there they will find only ruins,but they have to go through desert and territory controlled by Aunty and brutal residents of her town. Anyway they go without him, and he later goes finding them struggling in desert. He becomes their guide. They steal a train from Aunties town and escape. She orders that whole town goes after them and kill them. Last scene is similar like in second movie-brutal chase on a road.

This is his ultimate sacrifice,and they will never forget that telling stories about that to their descendants.

Casablanca, The Great Ditactor, Star Wars, Citizen Kane, films that alter the way you look at the medium - whether you like them or not, you still appreciate the craftsmanship that went into making the film. Personally, I'm not big on gangster movies but I believe that Goodfellas should be included on that list and judging by its near-permanent position at the top end of the IMDb's top 250, so do lots of others.Ray Liotta plays Henry Hill, a young man growing up in New York in the Sixties and slowly working his way into the schemes of local mob boss Paul Cicero (Paul Sivero) alongside the psychotic Tommy DeVito (a menacing Joe Pesci) and the cool-headed hit-man Jimmy Conway (Robert De Nero. As the years go by, Henry's success brings him riches beyond his wildest dreams but it also comes at a price. His marriage to Karen (Lorraine Bracco) is built on shaky ground and as the stakes get ever higher, Henry finds himself increasingly isolated as friends and associates either desert him or get whacked.Setting the bar for gangster movies ever since, Goodfellas is one of those landmark pictures that deserves respect. Like The Godfather before it, this feels horrifyingly authentic and utterly convincing but seeing as this is a Scorsese flick, that shouldn't come as a surprise. What does shock is how good Pesci is. He is like a mini stick of dynamite in a suit, ready to explode at a moment's notice and you simply can't take your eyes of him. Right from the infamous What's so funny? scene, Pesci owns this film. Liotta and De Niro, seasoned bad guy actors in their own right, can't hold a candle to him - indeed, Pesci has struggled to escape this role ever since. But all cast members are faultless in Goodfellas, another Scorsese trademark. And yet another is a supreme soundtrack and like The Departed, this is also a great film to listen to with songs you wouldn't expect to hear - the piano exit to Layla gives the whole film an epic feel that raises the hair on the back of your neck.It may lack the grandeur of The Godfather or the scale of Once Upon A Time In America but what makes Goodfellas unmissable, in my opinion, is how utterly convincing it is as a mob film.

So this is less a film and more of an event, something special that any movie fan worthy of the label owes it to themselves to watch. Being as this is only the second Scorsese film I've seen, I will admit to liking The Departed more but this is still a supremely good film, full of menace and tension throughout.

This movie is a remake of the 1959 movie House on Haunted Hill, with Vincent Price in the main lead. It combines old fashioned horror with the more modern horror style. This is nice for the fans of the genre but nevertheless the movie never ever really works out as an horror.Modern horror movies featuring lots of special effects are often being bashed but I must say that for this particular movie it does work fine. It's not due to it's special effects that the movie and its horror doesn't work out.Just blame the movie itself for that. It doesn't ever provide itself with some good scare and horror moments, which is also mostly due to the fact that it is often having too much fun with paying tribute to the more older horror movies. It makes the movie often more a fun and entertaining one, rather than a exciting or scary one. It makes the movie watchable but at the same time also yet quite ineffective.The writing just isn't anything too good. The script doesn't provide the movie with any good memorable characters you can also care about and it doesn't offer the movie any excitement. The story does try to put you on the wrong track at times but not all of the twists come as entirely unexpected and some of them also just aren't for the good of the movie.Seems Geoffrey Rush also still had fun playing in this movie though. He often goes over-the-top, in a positive way, since it gives the movie a certain degree of entertainment, which helps to make this movie still a very well watchable one. Other actors such as Famke Janssen and Ali Larter are also present but their play their roles a bit too straight, as if Rush was the only one who understood how to approach his role and play in a movie such as this one. Also Jeffrey Combs plays a small role, which I wished would had been a bit bigger, also since his character is not entirely irrelevant for the story.You can tell that director William Malone likes and understands the genre. All he needs to do now is to make a good and effective genre movie and use his skills and knowledge more wisely, since he certainly does have it all in him.

It tells the story of a man and his journey through life, and is told using a framework device in which the title character narrates his life-story to a succession of people seated next to him at a bus stop.Forrest is a young man from Alabama, probably born some time during the 1940s, although the timeline is rather confusing. He suffers from what would today be described as learning difficulties, although his athletic abilities win him a place in college on a football scholarship. The film follows him though his college days and his time in the Army during the Vietnam War, where he is awarded the Medal of Honor for his heroism in saving the lives of several members of his platoon.After leaving the Army, Forrest becomes a leading ping-pong player, playing against Chinese teams in ping-pong diplomacy. (The sport is always referred to as ping-pong in the film, even though its players normally prefer table-tennis). He then goes into the shrimping business and, more by luck than judgement, ends up making a fortune, becoming head of the Bubba Gump Shrimp Company, named after himself and an Army friend killed in the war. (In a curious example of reality imitating fiction, there now actually is a seafood restaurant chain of that name). On a whim, Forrest decides to go for a run, and ends up running for three and a half years, crossing America from coast to coast several times during that period.A feature of the film is its hero's meetings with the great and the good; he gets to meet three Presidents (Kennedy, Johnson and Nixon) and other celebrities such as Elvis Presley and John Lennon. These scenes were achieved not by using actors but rather by using special effects to insert images of Tom Hanks into old television and newsreel footage. One of its Oscars was for Best Visual Effects. Such effects seem to be a common feature of Zemeckis' films; others such as Who Framed Roger Rabbit?, Death Becomes Her and What Lies Beneath are also notable for creative use of CGI.Contrasting with Forrest's story is that of the great love of his life, his childhood sweetheart Jenny. Whereas he leads an essentially conservative lifestyle, she embraces the counterculture of the sixties, all radical politics, drugs and promiscuous sex. Eventually she marries Forrest while suffering from a mysterious virus (presumed to be HIV, but never named in the film as such), and dies shortly afterwards.This contrast has led to political controversy and to allegations that the film promotes conservative values. The conservative simpleton prospers, whereas the left-wing intellectual does not. The wages of radicalism are death. Certainly, the film takes the standard liberal line on issues such as racial integration and the Vietnam war, but by 1994 these issues lay two decades in the past. Culturally, its politics are much more conservative. Hanks's dictum that the film is non-political and thus non-judgemental has never convinced me. There is, for example, a lot of satire at the expense of the perceived hypocrisies of the hippie movement, such as Jenny's boyfriend who is against violence in Vietnam but not in his private life, regularly beating her up.Forrest Gump was one of the films in which Hanks, seen in the eighties primarily as a comedy star, managed to reinvent himself as a serious actor in the nineties, and brought him his the second of his two successive Best Actor Oscars. He is certainly good here, much better than he was in, say, The Bonfire of the Vanities or A League of Their Own, two earlier films in which he had tried to take on more serious roles. He plays Forrest as a sort of holy fool, a man whose simplicity allows his inner goodness and decency to shine through. The character became something of a cult hero, and some of his nuggets of cracker-barrel philosophy, such as Life is like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get have passed into popular culture. (In fact, most chocolate manufacturers provide a guide to their selections, so you always know exactly what you're gonna get, but we'll let that pass).The film itself is a reasonably good one, even if its morality as sometimes rather simplistic, using Forrest's holy fool persona as a means of commenting on the politics and culture of late 20th century America. Zemeckis manages the difficult feat of pulling off a delicate balancing act between comedy and tragedy without the resulting mixture ever seeming incongruous. Yet I have never regarded it as the best film of 1994, being merely a good film in a year which saw a number of very good, even great, ones such as The Shawshank Redemption, Four Weddings and a Funeral, The Madness of King George, La Reine Margot and Nell (which would have been my personal choice for Best Picture). Hanks' performance is good, but not as good as Nigel Hawthorne's in King George. I suspect that the film's immense success may have been due less to its merits than to the way in which its perceived conservatism fitted the public mood in 1994, the year of the so-called Republican Revolution which saw the Republicans take control of both Houses of Congress. 7\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"13 July 2009","score":"0 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Forrest Gump was the big film of 1994, being both a huge commercial success and the winner of six Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director for Robert Zemeckis and Best Actor for Tom Hanks.

(In fact, most chocolate manufacturers provide a guide to their selections, so you always know exactly what you're gonna get, but we'll let that pass).The film itself is a reasonably good one, even if its morality as sometimes rather simplistic, using Forrest's holy fool persona as a means of commenting on the politics and culture of late 20th century America. Zemeckis manages the difficult feat of pulling off a delicate balancing act between comedy and tragedy without the resulting mixture ever seeming incongruous. Yet I have never regarded it as the best film of 1994, being merely a good film in a year which saw a number of very good, even great, ones such as The Shawshank Redemption, Four Weddings and a Funeral, The Madness of King George, La Reine Margot and Nell (which would have been my personal choice for Best Picture). Hanks' performance is good, but not as good as Nigel Hawthorne's in King George. I suspect that the film's immense success may have been due less to its merits than to the way in which its perceived conservatism fitted the public mood in 1994, the year of the so-called Republican Revolution which saw the Republicans take control of both Houses of Congress. 7\/10 ","genre":"Drama, Romance"},{"date":"13 July 2009","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Stand by Me is such an excellent coming-of-age story that I almost wish I'd grown up in the '50s. I can only imagine then, for anyone who has, the kinds of emotions through memories that the Stephen King novella-turned Rob Reiner film must evoke. Still, anyone who's gone through puberty can appreciate the adventuresome innocence yet underscored maturity of Stand by Me.Taking place in the summer of 1959, the film is a childhood memory retold by Gordie Lachance (Dreyfus) of when he was 12 (played by Wil Wheaton) and he and three friends named Chris (River Phoenix), Teddy (Corey Feldman) and Vern (Jerry O'Connell) journeyed away from their Oregonian small town to find a missing teenager's dead body and fulfill an absent sense of adventure.Leaving behind their troubled home lives, the boys soon discover something else when they're out on their alone with only their own decisions to guide their actions. They make these choices together, quarrel together, look out for each other's backs and bare themselves emotionally in front of one another. You get the sense that if adults took this same journey that events would not have unfolded the same, with each man looking out primarily for himself. A boy, however, has nothing but his friends to help save him from a world that wants only to swipe his innocence away. That's the real power of childhood that this story unearths as it tries to understand that golden hue over our memories.Incredible, then, is Rob Reiner's achievement at making such a mature film about so much more than childhood with only children as the main characters. He captures these young boys on camera in a way that makes them appear like tiny sages helping us make sense of our own past. Having come only from rock mockumentary This is Spinal Tap at this point in his career, it's incredible the kind of performance Reiner gets from these boys.Young star Wheaton is instantly the boy we identify with most he's quiet, doesn't pick on anyone, but commands the respect of his friends. Feldman, child star of the '80s, sheds his nerdy Goonies character to become the daredevil of the group, which he manages to excel at. O'Connell plays the scared fat kid who gets picked on the most and Phoenix, giving easily the best performance of the four, is the tough kid with a good head on his shoulders who is really sensitive inside. There's no doubt that if Phoenix hadn't died tragically in the '90s that he would've become a major acting force as an adult. John Cusack makes a cameo as Gordie's deceased older brother and Kiefer Sutherland also appears as Ace, the leader of a gang of teenagers who are also after the body, but this film belongs to the young ones through and through.Giving the children their authenticity are writers Raynold Gideon and Bruce A. Evans. These are normal pre-teenage boys above all else they fight and pick on each other, have temper tantrums and occasionally break down into tears. Beautifully constructed is the metaphor of children following railroad tracks to an inevitable and shocking discovery.Stories about growing up are commonplace in Hollywood, but none will impress you like Stand by Me. It's the only film starring children that serves adults first and that places it in a folder in history where it might never be touched again. It's really a treasure of a film.

On Saturday as I was flicking through the channels and my missus was sleeping next to me I saw Armageddon on TV, so I started watching it until 1 AM... and today I am going to comment on some of the points that were criticised.First of all THIS IS A FICTIONARY FILM!!!! You watch it as fiction, it is pure entertainment. But if you want to be scientifically accurate... there is no proof to say this film is inaccurate... hence the fact that no one on Earth flew a ship onto an asteroid to blow it up... I hardly call that stupid. Remember the world used to be flat until not so long ago, and people got burned at a stake if they said they could fly.I honestly watched this and 11 years on and I still think it is brilliant just as when I saw it in the cinema. It makes you connect with the characters, you actually feel sad and I bet some people cried at the end. It has plenty of action... and will keep you entertained.My Defence for the film Why didn't NASA send its own astronauts?? well let's see, the job was to drill on a new terrain never drilled on before. The drill team have been at it for over 30 years... so professionals... that was their jobs. Just like the pilots for the ships, I could ask why didn't they teach the drillers how to fly the ship and send them without pilots? Oh and if NASA did decide to send its pilots instead of the drillers the film would become Deep Impact) how about that eh? I have to agree that they didn't need the Gatling guns... specially since they were trying to save space and weight.12-inch diameter drills that make 36-inch diameter holes, well lets see the drill head was a lot wider than the pipe... guess that details was missed out by the viewer.Sun glasses in a space helmet? who cares... I can drop down shades in my motorbike helmet with the click of a button... why wouldn't that be possible in a space suit? Animal crackers scene... what was wrong with that? Couple being silly... romantic...'personnel trackers' on astronauts? wow that would be very very hard right? since these days you have personal GPS systems to track your kids, dog, wife)... etc Ben Affleck succeeds in singlehandedly causing the whole joint to explode in spectacular Hollywood fashion. and I though the space station blew up because of sparks and faulty fuel lines... but maybe I need to watch it again for the 10th time just to make sure.800 feet into something the size of TX is less than a pinprick glad people paid attention to the fact that the asteroid was a lot wider than shallow, so yeah flat way size of Texas, deep... no idea they didn't say but 800 feet was enough to cause the fissures and blow it up.A gun smuggled onboard?

Here is a film that blurs the lines between reality and non-reality; realism and fantasy, but never comes across as a piece talking down to you, nor jumbled or misguided. Its documenting of those of a different universe that have all the power in the world in terms of telepathy and eternal life, but never feel as if they are really able to 'exist', is certainly very humbling as they ponder the prospect of what they deem proper, or real living to have goals, a life, to feel love towards another of your 'kind', and to ultimately, have an expiry date.Wings of Desire's narrative revolves around transition. It takes time over the establishment of an order or a lifestyle, complete with rules and conventions, and the want to break away and break out of that mould in order to become something else &#x96; something you've been observing your entire existence, feel as if you understand, but have never quite had the chance to fully engage with. The setting of West Berlin, in the late 1980s, and right towards the end of The Cold War as two 'warring' sides that are The East and The West inhabit spaces right next to one another, comes rather timely and helps 'place' Wings of Desire.One might say the film looks at Berlin as a real-life city in its contemporary state. If you subscribe to this, then the angels of the piece might be supposed to represent those in The East or what those in The East of Berlin represent. The popular belief from The West might have been that those in The East, indeed Communists or Communism in general, were mysterious; that they could see and hear you but you were not able to return that favour; that, essentially, despite these characteristics which supposedly makes them superior, most of them wanted to be in the West a lot more than you might have wanted to be in the East. This echoes Damiel's scenario and his general goal. Additionally, if you saw or met one of them, you'd be a little frightened despite the fact they very much represent you by way of pure, physical appearance. The conventions might also apply to the angels of the piece; as mysterious beings that most certainly posses a position of power and long to be more like those in The West, like 'us'.In terms of narrative, the film is primarily about an angel named Damiel (Ganz) who talks, ponders and muses with Cassiel (Sander) in an array of initially rather maddening voice overs that come accompanied with swooping camera shots. They seem to long for direction, feeling and some sort of vulnerability despite being these all powerful, wing-clad beings whom are invisible to anybody over the age of about eight. They walk the streets of this city trying to do good, just as they have been for many, many years. Damiel wants to be 'normal'; he wants to fit in and he wants to have direction. His whole plight might be compared to New German Cinema as a movement, something director Wim Wenders was involved in at its beginnings, as this film movement that wanted acceptance and an identity amongst the already established. Another reason Damiel wants this mortality is that he is in love with a trapeze artist named Marion (Dommartin).Wings of Desire is full of ideas. Its notion that one such immortal being has been around for so long and seen so much good and bad; pain and suffering; joy and retribution before finally settling for the time in which he does to become a mortal gets across the real sense of fondness he has for Marion, someone he stumbles upon as she practises her circus act with the rest of her acquaintances. The film also hits upon the notion that boundaries between this world and supposed others are thiner than you think and that those random bursts of reassurance we might feel in life are the results of angels of some sort desperately attempting to instill us with positivity.Additionally, Wenders gives us, as an audience, the viewpoint of these immortals which further distills certain issues of spectatorship within the film. If Bazin wrote about cinema being a 'window' into the lives of others, the angels in Wings of Desire are some sort of visualisation of this window an ability to watch others, often at their darkest times as some commit suicide; others find themselves involved in car crashes; and others suffer clinical depression as they miss male companionship. Despite it being rather ironic that it is a form of pain and suffering in a human that ultimately leads Damiel to jump sides, the film is a celebration of life, or why life is worth the effort. It has its characters pay meticulous appreciation to the colour scheme of the walls in some locations and has also has them honour the taste of certain things at certain other times. The manner in which Wenders only slightly uses colour in the early part of the piece makes the film feel more colourful and more joyous later on when everything is seen as it should be. As a love story and as an ambitious fairy-tale, Wings of Desire works rather well.

Additionally, if you saw or met one of them, you'd be a little frightened despite the fact they very much represent you by way of pure, physical appearance. The conventions might also apply to the angels of the piece; as mysterious beings that most certainly posses a position of power and long to be more like those in The West, like 'us'.In terms of narrative, the film is primarily about an angel named Damiel (Ganz) who talks, ponders and muses with Cassiel (Sander) in an array of initially rather maddening voice overs that come accompanied with swooping camera shots. They seem to long for direction, feeling and some sort of vulnerability despite being these all powerful, wing-clad beings whom are invisible to anybody over the age of about eight. They walk the streets of this city trying to do good, just as they have been for many, many years. Damiel wants to be 'normal'; he wants to fit in and he wants to have direction. His whole plight might be compared to New German Cinema as a movement, something director Wim Wenders was involved in at its beginnings, as this film movement that wanted acceptance and an identity amongst the already established. Another reason Damiel wants this mortality is that he is in love with a trapeze artist named Marion (Dommartin).Wings of Desire is full of ideas. Its notion that one such immortal being has been around for so long and seen so much good and bad; pain and suffering; joy and retribution before finally settling for the time in which he does to become a mortal gets across the real sense of fondness he has for Marion, someone he stumbles upon as she practises her circus act with the rest of her acquaintances. The film also hits upon the notion that boundaries between this world and supposed others are thiner than you think and that those random bursts of reassurance we might feel in life are the results of angels of some sort desperately attempting to instill us with positivity.Additionally, Wenders gives us, as an audience, the viewpoint of these immortals which further distills certain issues of spectatorship within the film. If Bazin wrote about cinema being a 'window' into the lives of others, the angels in Wings of Desire are some sort of visualisation of this window an ability to watch others, often at their darkest times as some commit suicide; others find themselves involved in car crashes; and others suffer clinical depression as they miss male companionship. Despite it being rather ironic that it is a form of pain and suffering in a human that ultimately leads Damiel to jump sides, the film is a celebration of life, or why life is worth the effort. It has its characters pay meticulous appreciation to the colour scheme of the walls in some locations and has also has them honour the taste of certain things at certain other times. The manner in which Wenders only slightly uses colour in the early part of the piece makes the film feel more colourful and more joyous later on when everything is seen as it should be. As a love story and as an ambitious fairy-tale, Wings of Desire works rather well.

Memphis retired from stealing cars six years ago, but is forced to make a comeback tour when his brother's life is put on the line. He's got three days to steal fifty cars. The list of cars includes Eleanor, a 1967 Shelby GT 500 mustang, a car that has eluded Memphis many times before. When Detective Castlebeck learns Raines has returned to town, he becomes suspicious, and is determined to catch him in the act. Memphis calls upon his old team to help with the twenty-four hour boost. This team includes an old flame, Sarah Sway Wayland (Angelina Jolie). Randall has four days to build a team, find the cars, and get them delivered to the pier.The film shows the importance of family and when we do the right thing, good things will come. Granted, stealing cars isn't a good thing, but it is Memphis' motives that are noble. He does whatever it takes to get his little brother out of the mess he's in. The characters are easy to relate to, and we begin to root for the criminals, which in the end are the good guys. The movie does a great job of drawing us into the story and making us feel compassion for the characters. We feel the adrenaline rush through watching them evade the cops, but the storyline still grabs our hearts through Kip's and Memphis' brotherhood.From the dialogue to the lighting we are pulled into this film within the first few minutes. The lights dim, becoming almost grey, while the cars are being stolen giving us the feeling terrible things may arise, yet it brightens up and the mood changes each time Kip and Randall reconcile. The characters talk in everyday language that is easy to relate to. The soundtrack is absolutely amazing; the right song at the right time makes a world of difference. Overall it was a great film that could easily be seen multiple times. You'll never feel bored.

First we see Lightfoot (Oscar nominated Jeff Bridges) stealing a car, and then we see supposed preacher John 'Thunderbolt' Doherty (Clint Eastwood) trying to be assassinated, and after being rescued they quickly team up to steal another car and party at a hotel with two girls, one being Melody (The Dukes of Hazzard's Catherine Bach). Lightfoot learns Thunderbolt is actually a bank robber, and they are travelling to find an abandoned one-room schoolhouse where a large amount of money from a heist is hidden. They are soon joined by heist gang members, once pursuers, Red Leary (George Kennedy) and Eddie Goody (Geoffrey Lewis), and together they plan a new heist. Until they can do it, they find jobs, Thunderbolt as a welder and Lightfoot as a plumber. So it comes to the robbery, it is successful, Thunderbolt getting into the safe and Lightfoot in drag, but the police are soon on their tail. While Eddie is shot and Red crashes through a store and is then shot, Lightfoot is getting over being beaten repeatedly, and he and Thunderbolt find the monumental schoolhouse and find the hidden money. In the end, Thunderbolt buys a new Cadillac convertible, and Lightfoot some new boots, but it is obvious the injuries by Red were more serious, and after a little slurring, he dies, making Thunderbolt the only survivor of all robberies. Also starring Gary Busey as Curly, Jack Dodson as Vault Manager and Gene Elman and Lila Teigh as Tourists at Schoolhouse. Eastwood and Bridges make a good duo, Eastwood does seem to let Kennedy, Goody and especially Bridges take up more time, but it is a fun crime drama. Very good!

Bond shows up at the hotel because his car has a flat time and bails her out of a deadly predicament. The novel dealt largely with the heroine and Fleming contrived the idea that he had awakened and found the manuscript on his bedside table. Happily, director Lewis Gilbert and scenarist Christopher Wood deviated entirely from the novel and Spy replicates the usual world-in-jeopardy plot pitting Britain's best against larger-than-life villains.It's Bond and Beyond, proclaimed the advertising campaign and Spy certainly lived up to the hype. Like Gilbert's first Bond epic You Only Live Twice, Spy was a military Bond with military hardware conspicuously on display in the form of British nuclear-powered submarines. Moreover, Bond appears in his naval uniform as he did in Twice and would appear later in Tomorrow Never Dies. Indeed, Spy inverts the outer space formula for Twice and relocates the action underwater with Max Stromberg, a villainous sea expert who wants to precipitate World War III between the superpowers so that bring about an Armageddon. Unlike Twice, James Bond doesn't have to undergo plastic surgery and masquerade as a foreigner. Furthermore, Spy contains more exciting action sequences that make it one of the five best Bonds ever made. For the record, Roger Moore has called it his favorite Bond. The cinematography by August Renoir's son Claude is absolutely gorgeous and John Glen's editing is stupendous.Just as Twice opened with Blofeld capturing an American space capsule in orbit, Spy opens with a British submarine mysteriously losing power while the sub commander peers incredulously into the periscope and utters Oh, My God. Unlike Twice, we don't know what has happened to the submarine. Later, a similar fate occurs to a Soviet sub. At this point, we get one of the most memorable James Bond stunts. When M (Bernard Lee) learns from the Navy that they have lost a sub, M orders Bond to pull out. Predictably, Bond is in the middle of making love to another beauty in a cabin on a high mountain slope. As he skis off to saw the world again, he runs into several Soviet agents who try to kill him. Bond races to a cliff and plunges off it, plummeting to sure death below until he deploys a Union Jack parachute. Meanwhile, we really don't know who is causing this unrest until we are introduced to an entirely new adversary, Ernst Stromberg (Curt Jurgens of The Enemy Below) who supervises an undersea kingdom and has quite unrealistically managed to turn his hands into webbed fingers. He has paid for two scientists, Dr. Bechman (Cyril Shaps) and Professor Markovitz (Milo Sperber), to devise a means of tracking British nuclear submarines cruising. As soon as they have proved that their system works, Stromberg kills them in a tragic helicopter crash at sea that he has engineered.The Soviet equivalent to M, General Anatol Gogol (Walter Gotell of From Russia with Love), summons Russian Agent XXX, Major Anya Amasova (Barbara Bach) to find their own missing submarine. He informs her that her lover, Sergei Barso (Michael Billington) has died on a mission involving a British agent. Eventually, she learns that Bond was the culprit and vows to kill him. The trail leads to Cairo and the two agents find themselves in a biding war with an Egyptian who has special information. As it turns out, Stromberg has dispatched agents of his own to deal with informants. Bond kills one of the bad guys, but he misses another, a seven-foot tall giant named Jaws (Richard Kiel) who has metal teeth and likes to bite his victims vampire style on the neck. Sure, Spy is pretty outlandish, but Lewis Gilbert maintains a serious tone despite the puns. The two opposing spies team up in an example of detente with M and General Gogol meeting in an Egyptian pyramid as a command center. Bond and the girl masquerade as Mr. & Mrs. Robert Sterling and visit Stromberg who makes speeches about how neglected the sea remains. Eventually, when Stromberg's helicopter Naomi (Caroline Muro) tries to kill them during a From Russia With Love style chase, Bond surprises his co-hort and leaps his Lotus into the sea and we watch as it turns into an underwear vessel, shades of Little Nellie the micro-helicopter in Twice. Stromberg kidnaps an American submarine, the Ranger, and we see that he does these abductions using giant supertankers with bow doors that open and gooble the vessel. Marvin Hamlish replaced John Barry on this Bond adventure and he provides a lively, atmospheric score that underlines the suspense. Carley Simon sings the title them Nobody Does It Better and this held true for this Bond entry. The ending with Jaws escaping after he kills a shark is a hoot. Although Spy is hopelessly far-fetched, the film looks fantastic and Gilbert paces it perfectly.

More than either Live and Let Die or The Man With the Golden Gun, The Spy Who Loved Me restored Bond to the high standards of the Sean Connery Bonds.

Captain John Miller (Tom Hanks) must take his men behind enemy lines to find Private James Ryan (Matt Damon), whose three brothers have been killed in combat. Faced with impossible odds, the men question their orders. Why are eight men risking their lives to save just one? Surrounded by the brutal realities of war, each man searches for his own answer - and the strength to triumph over an uncertain future with honor, decency and courage, according to the film's official synopsis.Once again, the Steven Spielberg and his crew of filmmakers climb to the top of the mountain, and deliver a terrific motion picture. This time, it's a heart-tugging pro-war (significantly, pro-World War II) epic of astonishing power. Initially, Saving Private Ryan impresses with its violent depiction of the Allies' D-Day landing, on the shores of German-occupied France. With waves of blood, Mr. Spielberg shows the human cost of defeating Fascism - by what TV anchorman Tom Brokaw called The Greatest Generation; although, honestly, every generation has its greatest, this is a fitting term.Captain Hanks and his squad - Edward Burns (as Reiben), Jeremy Davies (as Upham), Vin Diesel (as Caparzo), Adam Goldberg (as Mellish), Barry Pepper (as Jackson), Giovanni Ribisi (as Wade), and Tom Sizemore (as Horvath) - are among the few to survive the invasion; and, are ordered to save Mr. Damon's Ryan (for the reasons given above). During quieter times, the personalities of the men emerge, with Spielberg and writer Robert Rodat creatively painting human portraits. The silhouette of the war mother dropping to her stoop as the military vehicle approaches is one of the film's most simple, and effective, portraits; it supports the film's prime directive.Hanks and the men are a more complicated literary group of characters than they seem. Spielberg is obviously manipulating the story through them; and, their strongly-directed, natural performances help make it work. The film's main message is delivered by schoolteacher Hanks' Miller in his final words to student Damon's Ryan; listen for them. And, don't miss the secondary message, told by Mr. Davies' multilingual Upham character; especially, watch how he pleads with Hanks to set a German hostage free, and note the consequences of their action.It's tough to rank performances in an ensemble acting film (they're all stellar), but, for literary greatness, you've got to add Mr. Ribisi's doctor Wade to most memorable list. He tells an incredibly introspective story about how he pretended to be sleeping when his mother would peak into his room; note, eventually, Ribisi goes home to Mama. Also interesting is how Mr. Sizemore's Horvath serves as the voice of Spielberg\/Rodat, exalting and purifying Hanks' character. He says both the film's title and tag-line (Except this time, the mission is a man).Spielberg's use of flashback is one of the best you'll ever see; and, he definitively defines the term gut-wrenching decision. ********** Saving Private Ryan (7\/24\/98) Steven Spielberg ~ Tom Hanks, Jeremy Davies, Matt Damon, Giovanni Ribisi ","genre":null},{"date":"13 July 2009","score":"4 out of 8 people found the following review useful","review":" Seen through the eyes of a squad of American soldiers, the story begins with World War II's historic D-Day invasion, then moves beyond the beach as the men embark on a dangerous special mission.

When I saw Pearl Harbor six years ago, I thought it would reach the ranks of those films. But in like the recent Michael Bay, it was all effects, no movie.It follows U.S. Air Corps 1st Lieutenants Rafe McCawley(Ben Affleck) and Danny Walker(Josh Hartnett), buddies since childhood. Rafe goes to join the Royale Air Force Eagle Squadrons while Danny is transferred to Pearl Harbor. Before he leaves, Rafe falls in love with Evelyn(Kate Beckinsale), a nurse who is also going to Pearl Harbor. Soon, while in battle, Rafe is shot down and presumed dead. Danny and Evelyn are shocked, but then they begin dating. Three months later, Rafe returns to find this out, but soon forgives Danny. Then the big one happens the attack on Pearl Harbor, which Danny, Rafe, and Evelyn are swept into.Here's the positives. The score by Hans Zimmer is great and I think Tennessee one of his best pieces ever. The cast is A-grade, with roles filled by Jon Voight(President Frankin D. Roosevelt), Dan Aykroyd(Captain Thurman), Alec Baldwin(Lt. Colonel Jimmy Doolittle), Cuba Gooding Jr.(Petty Officer 2nd Class Doris Miller), and Tom Sizemore(Sgt. Earl Sistern). Watch for small roles by Eric Christian Olsen and Never Back Down star Sean Faris in the Doolittle Raids part. The best part, which I I do have to give my thumbs up to, is the effects. The explosions and aerial fights are excellent. The attack, while extremely flawed in historical accuracy, exploits all of those in a adrenaline fueled ride.Now for the negatives. The acting is TERRIBLE. Affleck is a joke, and Hartnett is no ace either(at least he did great in Black Hawk Down). The film is also highly inaccurate. I mean I know this is a love story\/ action film so there's supposed to be some inaccuracy, but this is way over the legal limit in my opinion. It's even inaccurate on the Doolittle raids. The only good parts are in the fighting and in total that only racks up about an hour and 10 minutes, leaving nearly 2 hours of boredom.Overall I give this film a so-so 5 out of 10 for the effects, cast, and music. Nothing more, nothing less.P.S. I recommend viewing the director's cut, only in the fact it's rated R and has a couple of extra scenes.

The samurai Kambei Shimada (Takashi Shimura) determines that he will need six other samurai to defend the village. The total of seven samurai trains the village how to defend themselves. They end up using a cunning strategy to cut some of the bandits off from the others to take out several at a time. At the same time there is an underling story of romance. This film is a very interesting film that uses filming techniques and quality far beyond its time. Akira Kurosawa was one of the first to use multiple cameras to get different angles. It has the action needed to catch the viewer with an underling story of love. It shows seven people who got together to help a village in need, which created a bond together that will last a lifetime. The village had a great victory defeating the bandits, but the samurai lost, in that they lose several of their new found friends. For me, this movie is a very inspirational film, which shows how friendship can be formed in even extreme times. It has the quality needed and the length to have a well formed plot that is difficult to see with many of the shorter films that they have now.
