Dark, beautiful, heartfelt, heartbreaking and triumphant, The Hunchback of Notre Dame takes Victor Hugo's classic novel and makes it fit the Disney Musical mold without sacrificing any of the thematic depth.When the powerful zealot, Judge Claude Frollo, accidentally kills a young gypsy woman, his only concern is sending her deformed baby back to Hell where it belongs. The Archdeacon of Notre Dame convinces Frollo to not only spare the child, but to raise it as penance for killing its mother. Frollo agrees on the condition that the baby live in Notre Dame's bell tower. 20 years later, the baby -- now a young man named Quasimodo -- is the cathedral's designated bell-ringer. When he finally gets his chance to spend a day among the Parisians he has watched from the tower his whole life, he finds them to be less than accepting of his grotesque appearance. The only person who shows him any kindness is Esmeralda, a gypsy girl whose impertinence in the face of Frollo makes her a wanted woman. Desperate to meet the new girl of his dreams, Quasimodo helps Esmeralda escape Notre Dame where she is essentially held prisoner by the guards waiting outside to capture her. Meanwhile, Frollo's inner demons are stirring, and Quasimodo finds himself trapped between love and his devotion to his master as a maniacal manhunt for the beautiful gypsy threatens to burn Paris to the ground.I have been watching this film since I was two years old, but it took me years to fully grasp all the subtext and complicated themes that are woven through it. A warning to parents with young children -- this IS a very, *very* dark film, full of attempted murder, successful murder, sexual frustration, emotional abuse, off-screen torture, etc. That being said, the movie is also very beautiful, and I'm not just talking about the animation. The film is very emotionally driven; the plot, the characters, the animation, the voice acting, everything rides on a wave of pure emotion from start to finish, and you are taken along for the ride. Scenes like Esmeralda's singing of God Help the Outcasts bring a tear to my eye every time -- Frollo's descent into madness is genuinely frightening -- and Quasimodo's declaration of SANCTUARY! is enough to make any heart soar.The score itself is brilliant, and carries the film, in my opinion. If I just listened to the music, I would get the same emotional impact as if I watched the film. The instrumental pieces are dramatic and heart-pounding (the opera chorus in the background is actually singing in Latin!), and the songs are a thousand times better than anything else Disney has ever done. They range in tone from the operatic and dramatic Bells of Notre Dame to the gentle prayer that is God Help the Outcasts; from the fun yet sinister Court of Miracles to the kid-friendly brevity of Topsy Turvy. The piece Heaven's Light is masterfully juxtaposed with Hellfire, the former being Quasimodo's declaration of his love for Esmeralda, and the latter being Frollo's confession of his sinful lust for her.Well, there are only so many ways I can tell you that this movie is fantastic. The Hunchback of Notre Dame is truly Disney's greatest film, bringing together both the dark drama of Hugo's novel and the upbeat brilliance of the Disney Renaissance to create a wonderful piece of animation. If nothing else, it's a great introduction to Hugo's work (Notre Dame de Paris -- the original title -- is one of my favourite books of all time). In fact, there is one thing that I think this movie has been able to do that no other film adaptation of The Hunchback has; in the novel, Hugo states that when Quasimodo claims sanctuary for Esmeralda, he truly becomes beautiful... and in this movie, he truly does.10\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"21 July 2011","score":"","review":" Beyond a shadow of a doubt, this is my favourite Disney movie of all time.

A total disaster on most levels of quality. This truly is the Godzilla film that was never supposed to be made. Why the film was remade was beyond me, but it was just straight up bad.There was no plot to the remake of the classic film we all know. It was basically meant to be based around the new design of the beast. There was nothing alike from the original Japanese version to the American remake. Godzilla was the beast, okay that's one thing but what else was there? If you are going to base a film off of another at least give a few names related to the first one. No names of characters were mentioned from the original. Nothing stuck true to the great original.Godzilla in 1998 was strictly dedicated towards the use of CGI. The effects were impressive but the way Gojira was designed was nothing at all like the 1954 Gojira. Knowing Emmerich I knew there would be a tremendous amount of CGI involved, but there was so much that the plot became unbearable, well that is from what plot there ever was initially. Little to no plot was explained along with the origins of Godzilla like there was in the original.The final thing that was poor about this film was the acting. Maria Pitillo was awful in this film. From her so called crying to, well everything else was just so bad. I don't know if it was just bad directing or if she was just naturally horrible. Either way, she was a bad choice for the role.

First of all, Woody Harreslson has like a bit part. He isn't even part of any of the major plot movements. He actually stands out like a sore thumb as some dumb, drunk, slightly retarded journalist with absolutely no purpose staggering around in a war zone.

No, it's not his suspenseful technique, his gripping stories or even his magnificent eye.

Yes, this is a suspenseful tale, but even more than that, it's a fun, dark comedy where the characters are so wonderfully bizarre you have to laugh in almost every scene.Each & every character is certifiably insane. The antagonist is one of the most original killers I've ever seen with his stylish, flamboyant, devil-may-care attitude (which, on a dime, can turn into obsessive mania). His intended victim is a super slutty housewife whose suggestive antics (licking that ice cream cone...) will have you rolling in the aisles. Then there are a bunch of demure old ladies who suddenly start giggling at the prospect of bludgeoning & burning their husbands alive. And even the straight-laced protagonist is so *extremely* normal you'd think there's gotta be something very wrong with his head. But to me, the character who steals the show is the young girl Barbara (played by Hitchcock's daughter) who is the hilarious Hitchcockian equivalent of a Shakespearean fool the brutally honest character who tells it like it is, exposing the sordid truth, but nobody really pays attention.Throw in a host of sideshow freaks (like the mother who is played by Aunt Clara from Bewitched in the same exact role), and you have a 100% madcap comedy on your hands. Even though it's about a sequence of chilling murders. Who could pull it off in the 1950s? Only Al Hitchcock. Today, directors are more at liberty to take a cavalier attitudes toward murder, mayhem & carnage. But you have to realize that Hitch was really one of the first to break new ground. I really think this may have been one of the earliest black comedies to hit the screen, back when comedies were always light-hearted, and thrillers were always deadly serious.Go out & see this movie on the big screen if you can (it sometimes pops up in film festivals which is where I saw it recently).

Its premise is cute, but its delivery is a little strange. It's a comedy with Pauly Shore, so you're not going to get very clever humor. You're going to get below the belt jokes a lot of the time which is perfectly acceptable. As long as you know what you're getting into, you have no right to complain about the jokes.Now do the jokes work? Most of them do, but most don't come from the lead actor\/actress. The most jokes come from the girl's brother played by Patrick Renna, famous from The Sandlot. Such a weird little thing to say that the character in the movie who isn't on the cover or mentioned anywhere on the back is the funniest character in the film. And, at the time, he was only known for his role in The Sandlot and I doubt many kids who took the time to see that film did the same for this one.The film is about a farm girl named Rebecca Warner (Guigino) leaving her South Dakota farm to go to College in California. Her parents, mainly her father (Smith), are skeptical about this College and worry that is may tamper with her original roots. She meets Crawl (Shore) who is the residential adviser of her dorm. Crawl is an off the wall kind of friend, and Rebecca thinks it's brilliant to bring him home to her strict family.In California, Crawl fits right in. In South Dakota, Crawl is a fish out of water. The rest of the movie is compiled of Crawl's misadventures to try to impress the family of Rebecca. One scene includes him of stealing one of the families machines and taking it for a joy ride throughout their field with John Denver's Thank God I'm a Country Boy playing in the background. I'm not proud to say it, but that scene was hilarious.There is also a strange, not very well put together love subplot with Rebecca and her boyfriend. There is nothing to even show that Rebecca even loves or cares about her boyfriend. Most of the movie is her blowing him off on various occasions. Also, we are lead to believe that Rebecca is in love with Crawl. Honestly, that isn't too believable because there is nothing about Crawl's appearance or personality that could make him attract a girl like Rebecca. We are constantly told she is a smart and potential-filled girl who wants to be a journalist, but somehow, she falls for someone with no hopes, dreams, other than getting through to the next day.Son in Law doesn't have the humor or chemistry Bio-Dome or Encino Man did, but it's better than Jury Duty and a little better than In the Army Now. The one satisfying aspect of this is you can see Link (Fraser), the caveman from Encino Man (done two years prior to this), in a cameo role. That and the fact this is Shore's Weasel personality at full force. That can be a pro or a con.

One is killed and the other becomes a werewolf. This first attack has a very lengthy and thrilling buildup and when it comes, it's utterly terrifying and awesome.One of the film's real highlights is the Oscar-winning makeup by Rick Baker. It really stands out in the transformation scene, when the main character transforms into a werewolf right in front of our eyes. He also keeps having visions of his dead friend in a gradually decaying zombie form. What also really stood out is the final scene, which takes place in a porno cinema. The man sees decaying visions of everyone he's murdered, who warn him that he will die. The film is also ridiculously funny in some parts, such as when he wakes up naked in a zoo and does everything he can to hide his man parts.Overall, this is a crowning achievement for director John Landis.

And effective.If this movie isn't a raging masterpiece, it is mostly because there is no real plot. It's slow going, even though it is meant to be deliberate and patient. It meanders along as he lives out his final isolated years and we are shown (in spurts) his work and his past. The old Goya himself is played with believable gusto by Francisco Rabal, and the younger (with surprising continuity) by Jose Coronado. Neither are names familiar to American viewers, but both are convincing, which isn't always easy portraying a famous artist. If there is a deeper point here, it is the journey we all make toward death. And from what I read, Goya was afraid of death, and would be afraid of old age just as much as this movie implies.If you like your artists heroic and inspired, you might find this version of Francisco Goya a little earthy and self-absorbed. But for me this was about right. He was an old man with little future, too much pain to make significant new work, and lots of memories. Of course, this being a movie (and being about life, too), there is an emphasis on his love affairs, or at least his interest in one particular rich woman, the Duchess of Alba. In truth, there isn't a clear history of Goya being involved with this woman, though there are several portraits of her (not including, most likely, the famous pair of reclining figures, one nude and one clothed, though this is implied if not stated in the movie).All of this is neither here nor there for loving what is wonderful about the movie. Director Carlos Saura has created a magical world for this final great painter, one filled with the grotesqueness we associate with his work but also with terrific inventiveness, making the paintings come to life without simply re-staging them. The best last sections of the film are a tour-de-force, and indeed the whole movie is vivid and surprising. If we are sometimes slightly unenthused about the events going on (which are often nothing much), we are completely sucked in by the ever changing scenes and sets and hallucinatory worlds, part real and part Goya's dying mind.In other words, the best of this movie is simply amazing.

Yes, there are certain aspects to it that haven't aged well, but you can say that about most everything that's been around longer than 2 or 3 generations. There are also aspects to this movie as good or better than anything made today, earning Frankenstein its standing as one of the progenitors of the entire horror genre.I'm not sure it's possible for anyone much over the age of 6 to be unfamiliar with this story. Henry Frankenstein (Colin Clive) is the obsessed scientist seeking to usurp the place of God and bestow life onto unliving tissue. He and his assistant Fritz (Dwight Frye) stitch together an awful creature (Boris Karloff) out of a collection of corpses and the abnormal brain of a criminal. But though Frankenstein succeeds in his experiment, his monster proves to be more than he can handle. It escapes into the countryside and arouses a mob of torch bearing villagers that traps both creator and creation in an old windmill, with terrible results.Just about everyone who's ever watched any film has probably seen part of the famous scene where Henry Frankenstein proclaims It's alive. It's alive!. That's somewhat unfortunate, because taken out of context it likely strikes most as over-the-top histrionics. If you actually watch Frankenstein, you can recognize it as a definitely brilliant bit of acting that highlights an electrifying performance by Colin Clive. Few actors in the history of cinema have ever embodied obsession more powerfully than Clive does here, up to and including Frankenstein's almost orgasmic sense of relief when his obsession is finally realized. Clive creates THE archetypal mad scientist; a man who is not evil but whose pursuit of discovery renders him morally insensate and incapable of appreciating any ethical limitations.It is Boris Karloff's work as the creature that gets most of the popular praise instead of Clive, which I don't think is fair, but Karloff is certainly remarkable on his own terms. He's as much mime as thespian in this role and conveys a real mix of humanity and the unnatural. Those fundamental human dimensions are what distinguish the creature from the increasingly inhuman monsters that would follow him in horror films.This is also a beautiful film to look at. Modern technology allows filmmakers to stick a camera anywhere and do anything with it. Director James Whale had much less sophisticated technology to work with, yet was inspired by the things he couldn't do to produce some completely captivating images. With moving the camera being a challenge, Whale had huge, great looking sets created and filmed his actors largely in full figure as they went back and forth, up and down through those sets. It is a joy to watch Clive, Boris Karloff and Dwight Frye act with their whole bodies, not just their faces and parts of their torsos. If anything, the passage of time that had led to the relentless use of frenetic camera movement and extreme close ups makes Frankenstein look even better today than it did in 1931.Whale brings an interesting take on mob violence to this movie as well. In the story, the villagers represent the forces of law and society rising up to deal with the terrifying threat of Frankenstein's monster. However, Whale doesn't shy away from showing the ugly, irrational face of the mob. In Whale's hands, their actions may be justified but he makes the audience very aware of the uncontrolled danger that's ready to erupt from these men.As I mentioned, some of this movie is quite dated.

Mae Clarke as Henry's fiancée and John Boles as their friend are also fine examples of the somewhat mannered acting styles of their era.

There are also aspects to this movie as good or better than anything made today, earning Frankenstein its standing as one of the progenitors of the entire horror genre.I'm not sure it's possible for anyone much over the age of 6 to be unfamiliar with this story. Henry Frankenstein (Colin Clive) is the obsessed scientist seeking to usurp the place of God and bestow life onto unliving tissue. He and his assistant Fritz (Dwight Frye) stitch together an awful creature (Boris Karloff) out of a collection of corpses and the abnormal brain of a criminal. But though Frankenstein succeeds in his experiment, his monster proves to be more than he can handle. It escapes into the countryside and arouses a mob of torch bearing villagers that traps both creator and creation in an old windmill, with terrible results.Just about everyone who's ever watched any film has probably seen part of the famous scene where Henry Frankenstein proclaims It's alive. It's alive!. That's somewhat unfortunate, because taken out of context it likely strikes most as over-the-top histrionics. If you actually watch Frankenstein, you can recognize it as a definitely brilliant bit of acting that highlights an electrifying performance by Colin Clive. Few actors in the history of cinema have ever embodied obsession more powerfully than Clive does here, up to and including Frankenstein's almost orgasmic sense of relief when his obsession is finally realized. Clive creates THE archetypal mad scientist; a man who is not evil but whose pursuit of discovery renders him morally insensate and incapable of appreciating any ethical limitations.It is Boris Karloff's work as the creature that gets most of the popular praise instead of Clive, which I don't think is fair, but Karloff is certainly remarkable on his own terms. He's as much mime as thespian in this role and conveys a real mix of humanity and the unnatural. Those fundamental human dimensions are what distinguish the creature from the increasingly inhuman monsters that would follow him in horror films.This is also a beautiful film to look at. Modern technology allows filmmakers to stick a camera anywhere and do anything with it. Director James Whale had much less sophisticated technology to work with, yet was inspired by the things he couldn't do to produce some completely captivating images.

It is purely a genre-film at its best a film in which the basic realizations and contents of a genre have been internalized perfectly. In this case the genre is samurai-film which is strongly related to the genre of western. Whereas from western the American mythology exhales, from samurai-film Japanese does. Although, the history of samurai-film extends to the 1930-40's it found its dynamic form and was truly born in the early 1950's when Japanese films first came to Europe. The genre still lives on but Yojimbo is, without a doubt, among the five best samurai-films ever made. Both, ironic humor and conception of the eternal weakness of the human nature characterize this exquisite film about a mythical character.Western and samurai-film are often compared to each other, and Kurosawa has said that Everybody likes a good western. Because people are weak, they want to see good people and great heroes. Westerns have been made over and over again and in this process a certain grammar has developed and I have leaned something from it.. They both take place to important phases of their country's national history and in the focus there are armed heroes. The heroes are often marginal characters in the society who return order to it but are also conscious of the fact that their virtuous action doesn't take them to the new, better, ordered society. And this is exactly what happens in Yojimbo as it does in A Fistful of Dollars for example. Kurosawa had the habit of placing his stories to history, far away, so the producers and managers of film companies wouldn't get upset of his anti-feudalism. On the big screen, he was safely able to tell about his thoughts without them being directly linked to the present day &#x97; and that's why it is samurai-film that he most eagerly studied.The story of Yojimbo is, from today's perspective, classical and has been lent dozens of times in A Fistful of Dollars (1964) and Last Man Standing (1996) for instance. The Japanese word 'yôjinbô' means a bodyguard or a hit man and that is exactly what the protagonist of this film is. The film happens in a simple milieu where two selfish robber gangs work. Soon an unknown samurai &#x97; played by Toshirô Mifune &#x97; arrives to the town and offers his services to one of the gangs. He cheats the other by claiming that he would be working for them. The other gang finds out and tortures him. However, soon our hero escapes and after a few days recovery he overthrows the hostile gang of 20 bandits and leaves the town in peace. There are no good and evil; just two evils from which the protagonist has to choose. We all know this situation. An ethical dilemma that is impossible to solve. We want to end the battle between these two evil but can't because we are too weak. In this the hero of Yojimbo differs from us. He can stand in the middle and quit the fighting. For Kurosawa this kind of social action is serious business and that's why he doesn't make a big deal out of it. He hasn't placed any hidden morality behind the hero's acts.Yojimbo shows that man is a wolf to a man, how people in reality are animals. The humor comes from the fact that we are quite ridiculous when we think that we are trying to attain morally righteous solutions. The message of Yojimbo and so many films seems to be that the world can't be observed through absolute morality. Both utilitarianism and virtue ethics collapse in the world of Kurosawa. For example, Sanjuro's only virtue is that he doesn't try to be bad, all the time. At times, he might make decisions that ostensibly are good but are actually built on selfish acts. Out of no solidarity or anything that has something to do with morality, he helps one evil to win over another. After he has performed his duty he can walk away and forget all about it. He resembles a god in Greek tragedies he descends down, does his mission and once again disappears. In one particularly intriguing scene he climbs up and looks down at people, from the roof. He watches the lives of people as a grand comedy &#x97; a seedy anti-hero observing.Yojimbo happens in a stripped, closed and simplified landscape in which ruthless and completely selfish and unethical groups of bandits work. Their cruel attitude towards the world is relayed to us most luminously in the scene where one bandit says to his son that To gain respect one has to kill more. Irony and humor mean complete destruction of morality. The desolation of Kurosawa's world view is most brilliantly projected on the life of Unosuke, the gunfighter. First his sight is innocent and curious. But soon the cruel corrupted world teaches its lesson and therefore he becomes a mighty gunman who digs up his own grave He died like he lived.At times, Yojimbo is close to self-parody but Kurosawa brilliantly reflects the violence culture in the zone of irony and consciousness. Yojimbo is a pure genre-film. But it is also full of subjectivity and personal sights. Death instinct, life at the gates of hell, the harsh reality of heroism, life control and violence culture viewed under the samurai myth but, in addition, Yojimbo talks about war-like glory and sense of morality the protagonist isn't a moralist. No higher moral purpose hides behind his action than cleaning up the town. He is cynical, melancholy and has a total lack of morality. Yojimbo is, at its heart, about an ethical dilemma, it's about the inevitable dialog between loyalty and glory. It is a grand story of humanity and morality.
