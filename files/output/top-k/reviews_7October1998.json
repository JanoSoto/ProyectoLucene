In fact, it may be the sort of thing that you need to be in the right mood for... Then again, there are those that loved City of Angels, but thought that Wings of Desire was slow and boring.This is the anti-Joel Silver film.  Forget the explosions, End is clearly disdainful to the successful formulas that make Hollywood films work.  The pace, while not as slow and deliberate as Paris, Texas, still takes its time, and allows the viewer to explore all sides--not just of a shot or a line, but a moment.  This is one of Wenders' great strengths, his disregard for hammering things home.  He has such a poetic sense of subtlety, that very few film-makers have ever matched it.  To some, this will feel like plodding, and misdirection, but it is a choice, a very clear choice, that works perfectly in what it tries to accomplish.There aren't any elements of End that I thought could have been improved much.  The dialogue seemed a bit rushed in spots, but technically, everything else is terrific.  The ensemble cast complements itself well, there are some great cameos, such as Sam Phillips accompanying a hand-held tape player, and the soundtrack ia gorgeous.  The themes are as rich as apropos as can be, and the visuals are so well thought-out they could have come from Kubrick.This is a slow-paced, heavy, convoluted film.  My vote for film of the year.
