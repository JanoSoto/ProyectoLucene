[{"date":"21 June 2010","score":"","review":" 1998 was the year Hollywood made Elizabethan England sexy. Elizabeth was one of two (the other being Shakespeare in Love) films released that year to feature the famed Virgin Queen in a prominent role, and both actresses to play her (Cate Blanchett here and Judi Dench in Shakespeare) received Oscar nominations (and in Dench's case the win) for their efforts.Elizabeth is by far the more serious of the two, but take that for whatever it's worth. This historical rendering of the young Elizabeth's rise to power is full of enough heavy breathing, whispered intrigues and catty spats to fill hours of reality T.V. The film looks lovely, and director Shekar Kapur keeps things moving briskly (even if I did wish that he'd stop moving his camera around quite so much). This was the movie that made me fall in love with Blanchett, a love that has not abated to this day.Interestingly, and weirdly, Joseph Fiennes and Geoffrey Rush both appear in this film and Shakespeare in Love. Between Queen Elizabeth and World War II, what would Hollywood have used for material otherwise that year?

Then came 1998 and his beefed-up performance in American History X, that no one believed he could pull off and then won him a Best Actor Academy Award nomination. I think it's his performance, rather than the movie itself, that people have since reacted so strongly to. He's great, but the movie is a bit of a hot mess.Norton plays a skinhead who goes to prison for a vile crime and comes out a reformed man, determined to see that his little brother (Edward Furlong) doesn't go down the same path he did. But director Tony Kaye doesn't have a disciplined bone in his body, and the film has too much stuff constantly going on to give the story or its actors their due. It also doesn't help that Furlong, whose character we're supposed to be rooting for, is a vaguely unlikable actor who it's hard to warm to.If an actor who on paper looked to be more suited to the role than Norton had played the lead, I wonder if this film would have the cult following it does.Grade C+ ","genre":null},{"date":"21 June 2010","score":"3 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":" Edward Norton came out of nowhere in 1996 to deliver a trio of performances (in Everyone Says I Love You, The People vs. Larry Flynt and Primal Fear, for which he received an Oscar nomination) that left everyone amazed at his versatility.

The thing is, it's not the violence that makes other and better war films bring home the horrors of war to its audience; it's the depiction of what war does to a man's psyche. It's another film from 1998 set during WWII combat, Terence Malick's The Thin Red Line, that stands as the year's masterpiece about war.
