This is pretty low budget material, and was probably just a project that the camp worked on over the summer.  Kevin Hiltzik could have made something extra special here but never quite got it right.  Sleepaway Camp is the story of a girl at a Summer Camp.  Angela (Felissa Rose) is really shy and doesn't participate in any of the games and doesn't even talk to anyone except one or two people.  The other problem is that people are getting murdered at the camp.  Naturally when people are getting murdered, the camp continues as normal, which is good because that allows the killing spree to continue unhindered as well.   One of the camp leaders knows who is responsible for the killing and is going to put a stop to it, but how many people are going to die before it ends?All things considered, this really isn't that bad of a movie.  Most of the actors involved were the kids at the summer camp and they are all pretty good.  The film quality is terrible though, and if there is one person involved in this movie that is due for a horribly painful death, it's whoever was in charge of the lighting.  This movie might have the worst lighting ever put to film; just about everyone has the lights shining right in their faces during every scene.  It's as distracting as it is painful to watch and it's too bad because it really wrecked an otherwise decent movie.  The basic idea behind the movie is a good one, but the writing that delivers the idea is pretty poor.  There is quite a bit of substandard material to sit through, but if you can make it, the ending is one of the best I've seen.  You have to give Hiltzik credit for this one because the ending is up there with the Sixth Sense as far as blowing you away.  If you are in the mood to try something a little out of the ordinary, check this one out if you can find it.

It was rumoured that Coppola never liked the ending,which has been talked about by many critics. There were rumours of tension on the set between Coppola and Brando. That Brando had showed up overweight and was simply not ready.Once the movie finally premiered, it was immediately acclaimed as maybe the greatest war movie ever made. With its technical affects and beautiful directing, some of the best I have ever seen, it was named as one of the hundred greatest films ever made. It's famous catch-phrase, which has become as memorable as anything else, I love the smell of nepalm in the morning has drenched itself into the English language.While the movie has had its critics, for the last act which many deem to be flawed, it is still maybe one of the most powerful movies ever made. It was nominated for 8 academy awards and won two for best editing and best cinematography.The movie chronicles the events of Benjamin Willard on a mission to find the elusive Kurtz, played by Brando, and to kill him. On now cinemtically famous trip down the river, he studies the man and wonders what could have made him leave all the wars behind and live in seclusion with followers. Kurtz had at one point been one of the greatest soldiers in the army. One of the most admired people there, with every award imaginable, but one day, a call was received. He had started giving out orders for things that were not requested by the army. He had won the battles, alright, but it was not authorized. Pretty soon the army could handle it no longer and wanted to get him back.He wouldn't come back. A previous soldier had been asked to find him there and he himself decided to stay there with a letter to his wife saying sell the house, sell the children... This fixation is pressed upon a the Willard character, a person in bad need of redemption, a person so accustomed to war, it has now become a fixation. The majority of the movie takes place with a wide assortment of characters as they are led through a river to where Willard must get of. In through the characters on the boat we see different assortments of people and the way they choose to deal with death and dying. The characters pass upon people dying, and making a brief stop at a base to where they can enjoy some playboy playmates.The story moves on and into the final act. Through that we see and understand things about the war. We see how the human being is dehumanised through war.  We begin to see the struggle of managing and training people to kill others. We begin to see the unindividualised attitude of the whole idea of war.The movie ends with the now famous lines made by Willard the horror, the horrorThe movie I must say in my opinion is the greatest war movie ever made in trying to portray the physical side of war. The moving and image shots of the airplanes in the air, the airplanes crashed through trees, the shots of soldiers fighting and murdering. The scene, my personal favorite, with Duvall's character putting on Wagner Ride of the Valykires was spectacular. The special effects, which are ten times more powerful than anything hollywood has ever produced, were simply spectacular. The directing was astounding and should have won the Oscar in 1979. Its overall imagry and brutally honest portrayel of war was simply amazing.But it is not a perfect movie. It has its flaws. The character of Sheen, in my opinion was not right. I think his character came through the movie as a parody of what we think a character like him should be. The movie itself, in my opinion came of a parody in certain parts, especially in the beginning with the voice-overs. There was lots of great acting, but none that I would say perfect. At times it seemed as if they were ooveracting and simply being too unrealistic. The voice-overs in my opinion were very important though to make sure that the audience doesn't get bored and tune of out of the movie while the shots of the airplanes were shown. The voice-overs worked as entertainment for the audience during scenes that would have seemed unnecessary if not for the distraction of the voice-over.I do not think this is the greatest war movie ever made. I don't think anything can be the greatet war movie ever made. A war movie deals with so much and so many topics, it is literally impossible to create a war movie that is perfect in everything sense. The two things taht war movies usually deal with are the realism of war through its shots and camera work and battle footage, and the other thing is the psychological side of war, what it does to man, how it does it to man, why it does it to man. This was done incredibly well in Apocalypse Now, but it wasn't it's main focus, that's it failed to be the best of all movies at it. Apocalypse's job was simply to be real and brutally honest on hour war appears and seems to the one who is in it.But I must say this movie was incredible in every other respect. As I said earlier, its directing was incredible, the visuals powerful, the scenes memorable, brutally honest, real, and ambitious in every way. In some ways its ambition caused it in some ways to fail, but in other ways it made it into one of the greatest movies ever made-American Film Institute.

It was even fun to pick out good parts by minor characters, like Benicio Del Toro.However, there are some infuriating lack of details in this movie.First, the movie uses all sorts of names from Minnesota towns. (Becker, Stillwater, Moorehead). BUT, it places them in Nevada. I can maybe see this because Minnesota's Spirit Mountain doesn't classify as a mountain chain (maybe they are even towns in Nevada). BUT, then why feature wildlife that has no business being in Nevada. (incidentally the movie was filmed in Canada).These are just minor scruples, but what really disdains me from the movie are its lack of details at key times.For Example--> Detective Jerry Black makes sure that the finger prints are taken off of the little girls buttons, but later we hear that Benicio del Toro's character had lots of chocolate wrappers and that this (not finger prints) proves he did it.  Later though (in the last minutes), no finger prints are taken, even when the cop seems to indicate (with his eyes that he thought of something).

(incidentally the movie was filmed in Canada).These are just minor scruples, but what really disdains me from the movie are its lack of details at key times.For Example--> Detective Jerry Black makes sure that the finger prints are taken off of the little girls buttons, but later we hear that Benicio del Toro's character had lots of chocolate wrappers and that this (not finger prints) proves he did it.  Later though (in the last minutes), no finger prints are taken, even when the cop seems to indicate (with his eyes that he thought of something). The movie somewhere along the line lost the story line of the other murders that took place (this in-itself is ok, but somewhere along the line, you expect them to be picked up again, and they never are).The movie could still be saved, but it seemed that at this point (2 hours in, Sean Penn just gave up). The last minutes or seconds of the movie ruined it for me, it totally changed what I thought was a good message film. And it is what changed my vote from a 9\/8 (for a movie I really connected with and enjoyed) to a 2\/3 (for a movie that made me leave the theatre wondering What...huh...it does not even say where it was filmed...urgh.I guess I should have read the book and had different concepts of the movie going in, but oh well.

It includes three stories this time, the first story of which is the worst of both films. It revolves around some young hooligans who brutally murder an elderly storekeeping couple, only to be served a dose of frontier justice by none other than the cigar-store wooden indian which stands outside. How can he move? What gave him the power? Who knows, the movie didn't explain. Perhaps if this segment had been a bit shorter, and perhaps had a bit of history telling where the indian got his power from(perhaps it was possessed by the spirit of a vengeful indian god?) it would have been more entertaining. As it stands it was quite dull, but the final scenes where the indian takes his revenge was fairly entertaining by itself. It didn't seem to have that EC comics twist like the other parts did- that is, some little bite in the rear end to jolt you. The original movie had some of these, like the scene in the Father's Day tale where it was revealed exactly what the undead father had on his silver platter- his father's day cake. I won't give it away, because I hope you will see the first one and be surprised.The second story, called The Raft, is pretty good but encounters one of the problems that this segment and the next encounters- sex. No, I am not opposed to sex in movies, but in this series it is uncalled for. These stories are supposed to be in a comic book a young kid is reading, and I find it doubtful that the store would sell a kid this young something with such nudity and explicit adult material. That's not the worst of it- the sex in this segment was completely stupid and needless. The story was about several teens who go out for a swimming party- and get trapped on a wooden raft in the middle of the water, surrounded by a black mass that reminds me of another one of my favorite movies, The Blob(the remake). The sexual scene happens after all but the main character and one girl are dead, and she is sleeping as he stands guard. For no apparent reason other than he was a teenager, he decides to take a peek at her breasts by lifting her shirt up. It wasn't just a quick look, which may have been acceptable- it was quite a stare and in fact was a bit more than a look(but for the sake of keeping my review PG rated I will not proceed any further). Still, despite this flaw, the story is entertaining and has an ending quite like the original film's tales. Like most of these stories, the hero gets it in the end and of course, also like these stories, he deserved what he got.The third and final story is one that is actually a bit chilling. A woman leaving a male prostitute's house hits a hitch-hiker on the way home. She had told her husband she was over a friend's house, so of course if she called the police he would find out she lied. So she leaves the man there to die and takes off. As can be expected, the hitch-hiker returns from the dead and seeks revenge. The main problem with this story is not the sexual aspect(even though, again, I find it hard to believe this was in a comic book, at least it made sense storywise and wasn't thrown in just because the director wanted to see some breasts) but the ending. Yeah, she gets killed, but so what? There was nothing spectacular or bloodcurdling, or indeed shocking about her death. Her husband simply finds her corpse. Now, maybe if she had been run over a few dozen times, that would have been something. Actually, there was a slight variation on the death which did very little to add shock, which was that she was holding the hitch-hiker's sign(you know, the sign they hold up to show where they are going).Between each story is the continuing adventures of Billy. I don't know if this is supposed to be the same loveable Billy who tortured his dad in the first movie, or if they simply forgot there were kids' names other than Billy, I don't know. It is a different actor when he's there, but most of the time he is a cartoon, as is the rest of the between-story segments. I think the major problem with the film was that Stephen King and George Romero wanted to make it but simply didn't feel like putting any effort into it. It almost looks like an unfinished project- if the film had a little bit more effort put into the first story(as I mentioned above) and had two more stories, maybe they would have balanced out the first story. In addition, the first film was written by Stephen King and directed by George Romero. This film was written by George Romero(but based on stories by King) and directed by someone new. Perhaps if it had been written by King and directed by Romero, and had two more stories, perhaps we would be on Creepshow 4 or 5 by now. But instead, the series was ended prematurely with this film. I really would have loved to see a new film every few years, with more delightful stories by the master of horror, Stephen King. As a side note, Tales From the Darkside The Movie had one story written by George Romero and based on a story by King, just like Creepshow 2. Interestingly enough, it was the only story worth seeing in TFtDTM. Perhaps if it had been included in THIS film along with one other story(maybe the legendary killer roller coaster story?)... but alas, if is a bad word, especially when depressed about what a great movie something could have been. Still, the movie is enjoyable if you can wade through the first story and try not to get too upset watching the cartoon interludes.I give it ** and 1\/2 out of *****.

I remember watching this when it was on TV one night with Dad, and we both loved it. Moore shines in his first appearance as Bond, and some of the sequences, especially the classic half hour long boat chase, which may be the best action sequence ever filmed, will keep you watching right through to its conclusion. When I went to see my first Bond film at the movies, which was &#145;GoldenEye' in 1995, I was disappointed, because to me it was unexpectedly not as fun as the earlier ones I had seen like &#145;Live and Let Die'. To my amazement, however, many so-called Bond fans dislike this film, and its precedor &#145;The Man with the Golden Gun'. To me, however, these are two of my favourite Bond films, mainly because there is more action in them than some of the Connery films, and they are more fun and enjoyable to watch. They may not be as serious as some of the Connery ones, but they are more fun, and Bond films are supposed to be fun! Roger Moore is my personal choice for the best Bond, but I am not saying I dislike Connery either. Connery was simply made for the part in the early 60's with great entries like the classic &#145;Goldfinger' and &#145;You Only Live Twice'. But I find that his other films are a little dated &#150; &#145;From Russia with Love' and &#145;Thunderball' are prime examples of two of the most boring films in the series, and if either of those was the first Bond film I watched, I probably would not have been hooked on the series as much as I had after watching &#145;Live and Let Die' first.

I just want to understand Soderbergh's idea for the film - which seems to me that - drugs is a problem that cannot be prevented, and as a result, we should not try to fight it because we cannot win. The reason I say it is because of the moment when Douglas comes to the drug addict, and asks him where his daughter is, and the addict sticks out a gun in his face. Douglas does not have any power at that moment, or at any moment in the film following this scene. This is also outlined in the end, when he cannot give the press conference speech, because he knows that he cannot fight the war against drugs. This was the main problem with the film, otherwise the film is fantastically made, and I don't want to go into the detail on how it is made, because there are fantastic reviews already. Think about the purpose of the film. I do not think the film accomplishes the task it was supposed to accomplish, and I think it the issue should have been substantially researched further, Drug Czar's role re-written, and the U.S. part re-shot.

I just want to understand Soderbergh's idea for the film - which seems to me that - drugs is a problem that cannot be prevented, and as a result, we should not try to fight it because we cannot win. The reason I say it is because of the moment when Douglas comes to the drug addict, and asks him where his daughter is, and the addict sticks out a gun in his face. Douglas does not have any power at that moment, or at any moment in the film following this scene. This is also outlined in the end, when he cannot give the press conference speech, because he knows that he cannot fight the war against drugs. This was the main problem with the film, otherwise the film is fantastically made, and I don't want to go into the detail on how it is made, because there are fantastic reviews already. Think about the purpose of the film. I do not think the film accomplishes the task it was supposed to accomplish, and I think it the issue should have been substantially researched further, Drug Czar's role re-written, and the U.S. part re-shot.

Okay, I laughed a bit and there is some pretty cool things about this movie, but overall, What Women Want is nothing short of a letdown.Nick Marshall (Mel Gibson), Playboy and Hot Shot in advertising, thinks he's God's gift to women. After a little accident, he discovers that he is suddenly able to hear what women really think. First, Nick is pretty disappointed when he discovers that his beloved macho behaviour does not exactly contribute to being desired. Then, his upcoming dream position in the company is being given to a new team member Darcy Maguire (Helen Hunt), not only a woman, but a man-eating one, also is a very talented ad expert. So, Nick decides to sabotage his new boss by reading her thoughts and selling her ideas as his own. Unfortunately, love gets in his way.Mel Gibson is very watchable as a guy getting in touch with his feminine side, and the idea is original, but the love story is too soppy, making this far too romantic and not enough of a comedy. It also has an over-long running time which seems to drag on for longer than the 126-minute running time which I was told by IMDb. Still, there's always the interesting characters and a very good first hour to keep you intrigued. (let down by a lazy second hour). Oh, I must mention one stand-out in the first 60 minutes; it's when Nick hears what a female poodle is thinking (Misuer! I need to poop!)A great disappointment, which is, thank God, not as bad as Mel Gibson's earlier 2000 film, The Patriot, but it isn't extremely far off the mark, either.I rate What Women Want 6 out of 10.

Directors began to pretend like they had a camera in a corner of the room and they were filming real events.  They attempted to make everything look as real as possible.  Bullitt and Mash are two excellent examples of this.  This new realism became a perfect style for thrillers.  Why?  Hitchcock taught that the key to suspense was to have a bomb ready to blow up but not let the audience know when it will explode. Realism is a perfect style to bring about this sort of suspense because there are all these seemingly unimportant events heard and seen, and the audience knows that they've got to pay attention because at any moment something important is going to happen.  When the surprise or shock occurs, wow.  Realism engages the audience in a powerful way, because they are required to pay more attention.  More is contributed by the audience and so the audience feels like they've earned the payoff.By the early seventies this became a popular style and really the only appropriate way for Francis Ford Coppola to choose in making his unknown masterpiece, The Conversation.  The style matches the theme.  It's as if we are spying on Harry Caul as he spies on others.This film was made in the days of Watergate and it is falsely assumed that Coppola was making some sort of commentary on it.  He had plans for this movie far before Watergate.  The movie uses a conversation as it's center, but it's not really about it.  It's not even about the wrongness of eaves dropping.The film surpasses it's subject and plot to express a far deeper theme and this is brought about by the development of Gene Hackman's character, and of Harry's character arc.  Harry Caul is a man of principle, religiousness, and morality.  His job is to listen to other people, but he doesn't treat his job like a peeping tom.  He doesn't care what they say.  He doesn't pay attention to what they say.  It's not personal.  It's business.  And he's the best in his business.Until one day he actually listens to one of his recorded conversations. Suddenly he realizes that his work gives others the motivation to do far more evil things than eavesdropping.  He begins to suspect that murder is in the plan for his subjects of study.This is a film about a man who begins to connect with his society and consequently reaches a new level of morality.  He discovers that life isn't just about keeping your own nose clean but about keeping others' noses clean as well.  He begins to make this step when he asks his coworker to not take the Lord's name in vain.  As he decides whether to give the tapes to his employer Harry realizes that to empower others with the opportunity to do wrong is almost as immoral as doing the wrong himself.Style and theme work hand in hand in this brilliant film.Oh, and one last point.  There is a scene in this film, so shocking in what it shows and what it infers that I just about fell out of my seat. It's clearly one of the greatest scenes in film history.
