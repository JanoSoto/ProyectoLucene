The original Terminator never left itself open for a sequel, but neither did it end so definitively that it wouldn't welcome one. The relationship between Terminator and Terminator 2 is therefore as perfect a relationship can be - both work superbly as stand alones, but I'm even happier knowing that this film follows The Terminator in the franchise. James Cameron's script and direction are typically top-notch in this second installment. He manages to give us enough information about the universe and what happened between installments without shoving exposition down our throat. Right up until Arnold barks get down, the audience is left completely unaware which Terminator is good and which one is evil. That such a mystery could be perpetuated for as long as it was is truly impressive. I also thought that the scenes shot in the mental hospital (action and non-action) were some of the best directed in the entire film. Cameron shows again that he's able to direct epic action in one scene and rip your heart out in another, which is a talent not many directors have. Arnold Schwarzenegger should always be commended for finding the roles that so best suit his particular set of skills. Unlike the Liam Neesons and Denzel Washington's of the world, Arnold has never been a fantastic actor, but he's a huge presence and a guy we love to root for. The unemotional, bland machine is therefore the most perfect role for him, and he plays it with such deadpan that he's perfect in whatever situation. A scene that calls for humour is all the more perfect for the deadpan delivery. A scene calling to highlight how unfeeling he is? A scene to show how menacing he is? Check and check. Where Terminator 2 improves on the original, in my opinion, is the range of talent that fills out the cast. In Terminator, Linda Hamilton was good, but really all she did was run scared for the whole film. In Terminator 2, Linda Hamilton returns with a vengeance as a tortured, unstable survivor who simultaneously manages to be a loving mother and one of the single most badass women in the history of cinema. Were it not for genre bias, I feel that Linda Hamilton could have cracked top 5 for the Academy Award for Best Actress. Go look up the five actresses nominated that year. Have any of those films ages half as well as Terminator 2? Edward Furlong is one of those rare child actor talents, an immature brat for much of the film, but with enough dramatic talent to make you care for him at others. Robert Patrick managed the unenviable task of filling Arnold Schwarzenegger's shoes as the villainous Terminator, and in my opinion he exceeds him. Arnold will always be the iconic Terminator, but in the list of best villains of all time, the T-1000 will always win for me.The visuals are top-notch, with the CGI used to great effect, but a sound use of practical effects during scenes like the motorbike chase. The stunts and choreography of that scene is incredible. And I can't stop without mentioning the costume - everything from Arnold's leather jacket to his sunglasses to his shotgun is iconic.This is the most perfect action movie that has ever existed. It succeeds on every level. I don't even need to tell you to watch it, because chances are you've already done so. But you should probably do it again.

It is a masterpiece of irony, and captures the essence of Robert Heinlein's masterful SF novel, which at the same time pays respect to those who give their lives to protect others and showcases war's futility and dehumanizing horror.In the near future, insectoid aliens and humans fight over colonizable worlds. It's not really clear who attacked whom first, one suspects the humans are the initial aggressors. You can be a citizen of Earth only if you serve a very dangerous stint in the military, protecting our home world from the insect aliens of Klendathu. The film follows four naive high school recruits (the 'hero' infantry grunt; his love interest, a space pilot; a female infantry grunt who loves him unrequited; and his friend, the skunkworks military scientist). They go through boot camp, training, and brutal warfare where the smallest mistake instantly costs you limb or life.This was one of the early digital effects movies, and they are still great to see. In fact, the effects here are physically more realistic, despite the usual space sounds and such, than most modern effects, which seem to have abandoned all laws of physics. The effects are also there for the story, not vice-versa.The humans in this film are almost as unpleasant as the aliens oversexed, perfect smiles, walking advertisements for a fascist military dictatorship. You'd love to punch them in the face. You root for the insects when certain humans bite the dust. Perhaps that is responsible for the moderate (ca. 7) rating on IMDb. The film paradoxically manages to condemn all-out war by glorifying it because in the end you have to ask who is nastier, we or the Klendathans?One of the minor characters proclaims, while his hacked-off legs and crippled arm come into view, The infantry made me the man I am. He says it proudly, and captures the dichotomy of serving humanity willingly by putting his life on the line, and yet the dehumanization and horror that war bring. The contrast between individual valor and bravery vs. the squalidness of the whole military-industrial operation overall.Pride and agony.

They *say* that they're a rich, affluent pair of thrill seekers who want Grant along for his expertise when they intend to go on a plane tour of Isla Sorna (the site of the second movie). As we can figure out, they're not playing it straight with him, and have another motive in mind. Predictably, the plane *does* land on the island. All Hell breaks loose as yet another gang of raptors and a particularly nightmarish menace called a spinosaur stalk our not too bright protagonists.Jurassic Park III really isn't all that bad. Of course it's going to come up short when compared to the first movie, but the filmmakers have crafted a reasonable thrill ride with a very good pace. Unlike the other movies in this series, this runs a mere 93 minutes (84 or so without the end credits), which goes to show that this kind of entertainment doesn't need to go on for very long. One understandable complaint is that the dinosaurs here don't do a lot of people munching; only a few characters get gobbled up, and you can pretty much guess who they'll be. This does manage to be somewhat intense nevertheless. It's *not* without its sillier and more annoying moments (the nightmare sequence comes to mind), and Ms. Leoni is unfortunately obliged to play the kind of twit whom we all hope and pray becomes dinosaur chow.All things considered, this is still better than the average SyFy cheese fest, if only because of the substantial major studio budget and the very talented crew. The special effects this time are variable - sometimes the dinosaurs look great, and sometimes they don't. The entire night time segment on the river is a solid set piece, and things culminate in what is a hilariously over the top resolution.Another thing giving this an edge over a more typical B movie is a cast of pros.

It is probably one of the most horrifying horror movies created. This movie details how 4 people have their lives ruined as a result of repeated drug use. The film shows how their actions affect their lives. This is a movie where you can't watch it a second time. It has nothing to do with its quality but the reason is because you don't know if you can put yourself through another viewing of it. What makes this film so horrifying is that the events that are detailed can actually happen and they have happened before. The first 2\/3 of this are bearable but near the end, it gets highly frightening as it shows how their actions effected them. The acting is magnificent. All main characters give strong performances which allow us to get more immersed in certain parts of it. Ellyn Burnstyn and Jenniffer Connely did amazing performances and Marlon Waynes was a shocker in such a serious role. Sara (played by Ellyn Burnstyn) is the saddest character who we feel sorry for the most. She plays someone who gets addicted to diet pills her doctor prescribes. I felt sorry for the rest of the characters but I felt sorry for Sara much more. This film must be watched by everyone. Not just for its frightening imagery but for its educational value. In school, we've been told don't do drugs several times in but in order to know how truly frightening the consequences of drug use can be, you need to watch this film. It's hard to watch but it will stick with you long after viewing it. This is by far the most powerful anti-drug film ever made.

One sort of such people is the guys who post huge walls of text, so huge that any point of yours gets literally smothered by those. No matter what you have to say, you'll simply be flooded with tons of text of very questionable relevance, and there will be no one else to actually care enough to dig through this mess and back your point. So much for believing that being logical and consistent is enough to win any argument.Watching Dances with Wolves was a bit of a relevant experience. Not that it was an awful movie that makes you go WTF all the time. Quite the contrary, this is a movie with a lot of positive moments, most notable of which is a stunningly beautiful cinematography, above-par acting and a very extensive use of the Sioux language, which adds a rather delicate touch to the movie considering it was made in 1990, when attention to such details wasn't as revered as it is now.But every now and then the movie takes a shortcut, feeding you with oversimplified, cloying or plain stereotypical views of things or digressing onto the secondary plot paths only to abandon them in a few minutes later. The most screaming example is the image of the Indian tribe that let the protagonist in they are all good people, noble savages to the brim who simply shine with the wisdom of simplicity. On the other hand, almost all the white people are arrogant, insane, cruel or dumb, which leaves no chance for the audience to have any sympathy towards them.This might be tolerable for an average 90-minute movie, but Dances With Wolves is an almost 4-hour epic, and, honestly, it could benefit from some trimming. Yet, instead of using this huge time span to actually show us things from different points of view, the film rams home its single chosen perspective, in case we have any doubt that what US did to Native Americans was a bad thing. Kinda like what Avatar did in 2009.I am actually surprised that this movie is so critically acclaimed. Apparently, Costner got all those Oscars and other rewards because political correctness and historical revisionism were reigning supreme in 1990's. Or maybe it was epic and sentimental enough so that people could forgive it for being somewhat shallow and one-sided.

Yes, that is the plot of Face\/Off, and the movie is one of the most entertaining movies ever. I'm not sure if this was supposed to be funny (I think it was), but it was hilarious. Watching Nic Cage play an exaggerated version of himself, and John Travolta do the same, was one of the funniest movie concepts ever. John Woo (the director) should also not go uncredited, as he adds his own blend of cheesy fun to the mix by playing the entire thing with a straight face. Well, sort of, if you've seen the movie, you know what I mean, if you haven't, let me explain. There are a few action scenes where the characters are doing the most ridiculous stunts you can imagine, and then we get some slo-mo and cheesy, melodramatic music to accompany it. This movie doesn't sound like it would be so great, but it is. This movie is long, but it was an absolute blast from beginning to end. But, we've covered the humor already, let's talk about the cast a little more thoroughly. I am a big Nicolas Cage fan, and think the guy is very funny, and his mere presence makes almost any movie worth watching. John Travolta I haven't seen in much besides this, but his acting skills don't seem as impressive. In this movie he's very funny, but I think that might be the script more than anything else, because basically we get to see two people playing Nicolas Cage. Yeah, if you can imagine that, you'll know you're in for a big treat with this movie. There are a few co-stars, who are hardly noticeable next to Cage and Travolta who chew up screen time, but they are there. Castor Troy has a machine gun toting girl-friend who guns down dozens of cops who attack their base, but she's still treated as a hero, and Archer (in Troy's body) is okay with it. The implausibility of the movie is part of what makes it so good. Troy has some other buddies, none of whom do much, and then there's Archer's family and friends. Literally every other FBI agent hunting Troy is faceless, none of them have any personality and I don't remember any of their names, but that's okay. Travolta and Cage provide enough personality for a whole trilogy. Archer's wife is a decent actress, but again, it's a pretty thankless role. Archer's daughter is pretty generic, but she gets a bit more personality, and brings it a very funny moment when Troy (in Archer's body) attacks her boyfriend. It's funnier than it sounds. The action is insanely over-the-top, kind of like Mission Impossible 2 action, but slightly toned down. However, it is over-the-top in a funny way. In the end Face\/Off is a hilarious movie filled with great dialogue, very funny acting, over-the-top action, and a crazy story. If you want to see the quintessential crazy Nicolas Cage movie, watch Face\/Off. You won't be disappointed.

I was in college in 1999 only 20 miles away from Burkesville MD and so I understand as well as anyone the huge sensation 'The Blair Witch Project' caused. Every weekend about 25% of my college would roam around the Burkesville woods getting drunk and high.Hence, this film really hits home for me. Just as the viewer is forced to be around hung over kids whom spent the night drinking and smoking in the woods, so was a whole year of my college life! This is the classic example of a rushed sequel punched out to cash in the original's popularity before the fad wears off ('Sister Act 2' 'Sherk 2' 'Shanghai Knights') without any regard for quality. The studio never cares about quality because the sequel factor alone will guarantee box office success.The major factor here is that ALL FIVE of the characters are just named after the actors playing them! That's how fast this script was punched out! It was literally written ON THE SET! I'll never forget the trailer for this. Usually trailers highlight the major action and money shots of the film. This trailer actually showed a girl dancing on bed. Yup, that's the best shot they could show us to drag us into the theaters! A girl dancing on a bed! This is supposed to be a scary movie right?Anyway, five stoners camp out in the Burkesville woods just like 'The Blair Witch Project.' Scary? I'm always amused at how even respected film critics like Roger Ebert religiously recited 'The Blair Witch Project's promo, the Black Hills of Maryland as if somehow it's scary. Burkesville is the suburbs. The suburbs! No one can get lost in someone's backyard! And any campers would be arrested for trespassing. It's the suburbs! After a hard night of drinking and drugs the five kids awaken to find their book in progress destroyed by an industrial shredder. They all act surprised at having blacked out as if something scary has happened. Nothing scary has happened! They just passed out drunk! Next, the pregnant girl has a miscarriage. Drinking and drugging will cause that as well. The nurse at the hospital says, Your body is telling you something's not right. as if it is scary. No, it's just the drinking and drugs! So the five kids go to what's described as an abandoned Civil War factory. WOW! Plumbing, electricity, paint and glass that's held up for 150 years! No wonder the North won the war, they were really advanced. WWII factor we might buy. But Civil War factory? Anyway, the kids watch the tapes of themselves from the night before but find nothing until they're played backwards. OF course you can't really do that because video doesn't work the same as film but whatever. The backwards footage reveals an orgy of drinking and drugs. We already knew about this!!! The kids then go into a trance and wander off to murder an neighboring group of campers. They're so out of their minds that they remember to bring a camcorder with them to capture it for posterity.Next the kids are interrogated by the police in scenes which fail to work as either drama or comedy as ALL the cops are overly acting redneck stereotypes. Again, Burkesville isn't the Deep South. It's the suburbs! Why are ALL the cops inbred rednecks? If the movie isn't going to take these scenes seriously neither is the audience.All in all it is fun for some laughs and not horribly made. It does go down as a classic example of a punched out and rushed cash in sequel.Only one mystery remains. What's the Book of Shadows? There are no books or shadows in this film or even mention of them! Again, this leads me to conclude there were multiple studio scripts and rewrites and the film was just slapped together without regard.

I was in college in 1999 only 20 miles away from Burkesville MD and so I understand as well as anyone the huge sensation 'The Blair Witch Project' caused. Every weekend about 25% of my college would roam around the Burkesville woods getting drunk and high.Hence, this film really hits home for me. Just as the viewer is forced to be around hung over kids whom spent the night drinking and smoking in the woods, so was a whole year of my college life! This is the classic example of a rushed sequel punched out to cash in the original's popularity before the fad wears off ('Sister Act 2' 'Sherk 2' 'Shanghai Knights') without any regard for quality. The studio never cares about quality because the sequel factor alone will guarantee box office success.The major factor here is that ALL FIVE of the characters are just named after the actors playing them! That's how fast this script was punched out! It was literally written ON THE SET! I'll never forget the trailer for this. Usually trailers highlight the major action and money shots of the film. This trailer actually showed a girl dancing on bed. Yup, that's the best shot they could show us to drag us into the theaters! A girl dancing on a bed! This is supposed to be a scary movie right?Anyway, five stoners camp out in the Burkesville woods just like 'The Blair Witch Project.' Scary? I'm always amused at how even respected film critics like Roger Ebert religiously recited 'The Blair Witch Project's promo, the Black Hills of Maryland as if somehow it's scary. Burkesville is the suburbs. The suburbs! No one can get lost in someone's backyard! And any campers would be arrested for trespassing. It's the suburbs! After a hard night of drinking and drugs the five kids awaken to find their book in progress destroyed by an industrial shredder. They all act surprised at having blacked out as if something scary has happened. Nothing scary has happened! They just passed out drunk! Next, the pregnant girl has a miscarriage. Drinking and drugging will cause that as well. The nurse at the hospital says, Your body is telling you something's not right. as if it is scary. No, it's just the drinking and drugs!

Beethoven's Scherzo (never mind Freude, schöner Götterfunken) is one of my favorites, and now almost every time I hear it, I think at least fleetingly of brutal sexual assault because the film immediately comes to mind. At least in 2001 A Space Odyssey the images that come to mind are of rotating space stations and trans-warp distortions.Although its Russo-British the-world-has-gone-down-the-tubes is a bit dated, Clockwork is a compelling alternate universe. In the film, gangs of high school hoodlums whose parents barely pay attention to them kill, rape, and intimidate one another at night. The narrator, who's a smart and charismatic kid and might have turned out OK, is scary in his matter-of-fact narration of the story, which swiftly takes him into the hands of unscrupulous politicians as a guinea pig for a Pavlov-like conditioning to rehabilitate criminals on the double.The film has many themes, but the theme of choice is inherent in all of them. Take away a person's ability to choose, and you cannot have true good or evil. As a dystopia, the film fails to find any good in anyone, except perhaps its main character, and in the priest who calls out the question of choice. The parents are whining, inattentive cowards; the politicians are ... politicians; the nurses care more about sex than patients; the doctors are cold-blooded beasts; the police are as brutal as the criminals; even the liberal, whose wife died as a result of our anti-hero's rampages, yet who wants to help him find choice again, rejoices at the pain when he applies Beethoven saturation-training to undo the governmental conditioning.Kubrick never made a bad film, or even a merely good film.

The plot covers his & others guards lives' which is greatly affected when they find out that their newly arrived prisoner, a giant African-American man, is gifted with supernatural powers.Written & directed by Frank Darabont, the film marks yet another adaptation of a Stephen King's novel by the filmmaker and once again, he has transformed it beautifully on the silver screen.

The passage of time in the prison is strongly felt in the film's own 188 minutes of runtime but it never becomes an chore for the drama is too absorbing & rich in content.

Hanks is once again at his usual best but it's Duncan who steals the show with a truly heartbreaking performance and the scenes between him & Hanks are a treat to watch.

Sure it gets overly sentimental at times but none of those moments appear as a desperate attempt to move the viewers but genuine progression of the story.

You realise just how brilliant Steven Spielberg is.Jurassic Park III is simply a pointless movie that never should have been made. The film simply reeks of a cheap sequel. The basic plot tells of a couple who tricks Dr. Alan Grant to take them into Jurassic Park after their son is lost on the island while parasailing. Predictably, all hell breaks loose as the dinosaurs continue to wreak havoc. Unfortunately, in all of this havoc there is not a single moment of decent dialogue, acting, directing, or special effects. The filmmakers seem to have interpreted the original Jurassic Park as a horror film, and treat this movie as such. Characters die in a timely and organised fashion, characters attempt to separate in order to be more effective, and so forth. The original Jurassic Park was not a horror film, and this movie should not have been treated as such.I doubt that many people had high expectations for Jurassic Park III as a good film. Most probably thought the movie would simply be an enjoyable escape for an hour and a half with great special effects and a few memorable scenes. Yet somehow, even with a budget of approximately ninety million dollars, the movie's special effects were terrible. In the opening scene, I heard a kid behind me who couldn't have been older than eight turn to his mom and say Mommy, that looks so fake. If the special effects couldn't even make a child believe, how are they supposed to convince the rest of the public? Another huge weakness in this movie is the timing. One thing that made the original Jurassic Park great was the memorable scenes. I can instantly recall great scenes from the movie, such as the T-Rex chasing the Jeep at night, the young boy climbing the electric fence and getting electrocuted, and so forth. Jurassic Park III doesn't have any sense of timing, and as a result the film just feels like a bunch of scenes that bleed into each other without any rhyme or reason. A few moments in the movie could have actually been memorable scenes had they been timed correctly, but instead they are easily discarded and thought of as a joke. The lack of special effects and memorable scenes kills the possibility of Jurassic Park III even being an enjoyable excursion.Yet through all the bad acting, poor writing, and mindless directing, the biggest weakness in the film is not as obvious. The filmmakers failed to realise what the original Jurassic Park was about. It was not simply a horror or action film in which the protagonists ran away from scary beasts. The film was an examination of man's role in nature and of how we view ourselves as the mighty rulers of the universe. While there were exciting chase scenes and great special effects, those were not the theme of the film. Jurassic Park III forgets all of this, and even occasionally mocks these themes in the original. If you took these themes away from the original film, all you would have had left would be a hollow horror film with great special effects. Jurassic Park III is simply a hollow horror film with mediocre special effects. Jurassic Park is a story about man; Jurassic Park III is a story about dinosaurs. That is the primary difference between the two films.One would have thought that with the budget and the resources the filmmakers had, they could have produced a better movie than Jurassic Park III. Instead, the movie is a reminder of Jaws, another amazing Spielberg film that had sequels made by different directors that were subsequently mindless waste.

But beyond the idea for the plot, and our seeing it carried out, there isn't anything spectacular about The Sting. I give it seven stars, but it is far from ever making a list of my favorite 250 films. The movie has a considerable cast of familiar names of the day. Some have endearing roles in the film. Only two performances stand out as above average &#x96; Paul Newman as Henry Gondorff, and Robert Shaw as Doyle Lonnegan. Newman didn't get an Academy Award nomination, but Robert Redford did for his role of Johnny Hooker. I give a clear nod to Newman for the versatility of his role, and his carrying it off quite well. He was serious at times, light-hearted at others, and switched to the raucous, loud and unafraid drunken card player &#x96; purposely taunting Shaw's Lonnegan. That was a good piece of acting. The cast were all quite good, the costumes and other technical aspects were good. Those are the things that earned The Sting most of its seven Oscars. And, they were probably deserved awards. The fact that this film won the best picture Oscar indicates that the competition wasn't that great for 1973. There were a few very good films and after that, only mediocre stuff. Still, I can't see how this film won out over The Exorcist. On the other hand, I think George Roy Hill was deserving of the Oscar for directing The Sting. It would be a toss-up between him and William Friedkin for The Exorcist.The voters in Hollywood must have been in a light or romantic mood that year. The acting Oscars (save for Jack Lemmon's best actor in Save the Tiger) went to actors in light, comedy romances and dramas. A couple of outstanding performances were passed over by actors in The Exorcist.The script for The Sting, was good, but not very witty or funny. The dialog between Hooker and Gondorff when they first meet, is the only really funny scene. Hooker, Luther said I could learn something from you. I already know how to drink. Gondorff, later, Are you going to stay for breakfast, or do you already know how to eat? Hooker, Can you get a mob together? Gondorff, With what happened to Luther, I don't think I can get more than two-, three hundred guys.

I still think it's very entertaining and fun. The movie is billed as a comedy, crime and drama. But beyond the idea for the plot, and our seeing it carried out, there isn't anything spectacular about The Sting. I give it seven stars, but it is far from ever making a list of my favorite 250 films. The movie has a considerable cast of familiar names of the day. Some have endearing roles in the film. Only two performances stand out as above average &#x96; Paul Newman as Henry Gondorff, and Robert Shaw as Doyle Lonnegan. Newman didn't get an Academy Award nomination, but Robert Redford did for his role of Johnny Hooker. I give a clear nod to Newman for the versatility of his role, and his carrying it off quite well. He was serious at times, light-hearted at others, and switched to the raucous, loud and unafraid drunken card player &#x96; purposely taunting Shaw's Lonnegan. That was a good piece of acting. The cast were all quite good, the costumes and other technical aspects were good. Those are the things that earned The Sting most of its seven Oscars. And, they were probably deserved awards. The fact that this film won the best picture Oscar indicates that the competition wasn't that great for 1973. There were a few very good films and after that, only mediocre stuff. Still, I can't see how this film won out over The Exorcist. On the other hand, I think George Roy Hill was deserving of the Oscar for directing The Sting.

With that said, I also need to reveal I always felt some kind of attraction towards Tarantino's work. Growing up I always wanted to watch his movies. Some said to me there were B-Movies, something more independent to a more restricted public and now that I'm on my teens and after watching Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs, I can surely assume the films really are niche-focused. After the viewing of this two I'm now seeking to see the two Kill Bills and Django Unchained(which I've seen roughly 30 minutes a long time ago)But,now, let's go down to business and talk about the gem that is Reservoir Dogs.Tarantino made his feature film debut with this one, in 1992. The plot revolves around a jewelry store robbery that goes incredibly wrong. The gangsters then try to uncover the true identity of the one who has set them up. The cast on this one is simply amazing! We have Harvey Keitel (who also produced the film) giving one of his best performances as Mr. White (the most experienced member of the group); Tim Roth who in his first outing with Tarantino gave a very solid performance as Mr. Orange; Steve Buscemi also is quite good as Mr. Pink; Michael Madsen shines as Mr.Blonde; Quentin Tarantino himself gives a good performance as Mr.Brown(specially with his Like a Virgin interpretation in the beginning) and also other good performances by Chris Penn and Lawrence Tierney. Tarantino was one of the first directors to adopt the widescreen technology which grants the movie some amazing shots. He directs his features as no other, mixing humour with gore and intensity. The soundtrack as always in his movies, his excellent, taking the viewer back to the 70's. The pace of the movie is well built and Tarantino takes time to explain the three major PoVs of the plot  the one of Mr.White, the one Mr.Blue and the one of Mr.Orange. This develops the storytelling and also gives us even more background information about these characters. After watching I can truthfully say this movie sure deserves it's place on IMDb's Top 250, being an instant classic. It's just amazing and unpredictable, being of the best of the 90's and one of the best films ever made. Let's just wait for The Hateful Eight!

The more I watch this film, the better it gets. Just the close-up shots of Hannibal Lecter's (Anthony Hopkins) and Clarisse Starling's (Jodie Foster) faces.I recently saw it for the 5th time with my daughter, who saw it for the 1st time. She was on the edge of her seat just as I remember, while I enjoyed the deft plotting, the great characterization, even of side-characters (like the self-absorbed psychiatrist Chilton), who were painted with sparse but knowing strokes.Hopkins and Foster are just perfectly cast, doing the perfect mannerisms, the perfect accents, the perfect everything. The supporting cast is also outstanding, from Starling's boss, who uses her as bait to engage dangerous psychopath Lecter to solve a serial murder case, to the unpleasant psychiatrist Chilton, to the victim held captive in a pit by the serial killer, all the way to the psychopathic serial killer who is sowing himself a female identity out of his victim's skins.The clues abound, and while obvious in hindsight, are subtle enough to be interesting Southeast Asian moth = criminal is a Vietnam War veteran. Seamstress patterns in closets to reveal where the perpetrator must have learned the sowing trade.Although the gore is very sparse in this film, it is really shocking, and built up just right to cause maximum suspense and yech factor. The director manages to make you wince even when you don't get to see all that much.So why only 9\/10? After many viewings, I think more and more that the cutting between Starling and her boss at the end, when he enters the wrong house, is too cheap a trick to show that he ended up tracking the wrong person. Likewise, the break into the storage scene lays on the difficulties with forced entry a bit much. Hitchcock would have stayed away from such low-grade suspense devices. Sometimes less is more. Still, this film is better than a few of the grandmaster's thrillers, and that's saying something coming from a fan who saw his first Hitch while the grandmaster was still filming them!
