So when Supernova turned out to be a pretty standard sci-fi adventure movie (though appropriately ridiculous at times), I was disappointed.It's not a good movie, let me make that clear. There is enough meaningless sci-fi babble to fill an entire season of Star Trek Voyager. James Spader looks absurd in a spacesuit - and I mean more than most people do. The jock from Can't Hardly Wait is the bad guy, and also naked about half the time he's on screen for no reason at all. For that matter, just about everybody gets naked in this movie. Why? Because it's allegedly titillating.The entire plot feels recycled, from Spader's bad boy space cadet to the universe-destroying alien artifact his crew picks up along with the mysterious stranger played by the jock. Their ship is a rescue vessel responding to an SOS beacon on some distant moon. Spader is a new crew member of the ship, but the captain is killed en route to the emergency, putting him in charge. Where there was once an entire mining colony, they find only The Jock and his magic rock, which will have a peculiar effect on people who handle it throughout the movie. Lo and behold, The Jock is not all he seems to be and he spends the whole movie trying to seduce the others with promises of money, power, and\/or sex, or killing them because he's just not that persuasive. The events in the movie do not carry any weight because we're not given even a chance to like these characters before they get put through the wringer. The characters are here to advance the plot instead of the other way around. It's too bad the plot is made up of several poorly directed action sequences. Here's a funny thing&#133; You put Sigourney Weaver in a giant robot suit to fight the alien Queen, that rocks. You give Bruce Campbell a chainsaw hand, that's marvelous!

The only real upshot of a repeated viewing of this film, decades later, is to see Eddie Murphy in his first film as a criminal who is let out before becoming a cop for the narratives duration.I can see how Murphy went on to bigger and better things by watching this film. Whilst not a comedy by any stretch of the imagination, Murphy plays his character named Reggie Hammond to such a degree that by the end when it seems like he has to go back to prison, we have empathised with him and associated ourselves close enough to even like him; maybe more than the lead character Jack Cates (Nolte). But this is where the films apparent familiarity comes into play; Reggie may have been a criminal and may have served two thirds of his sentence but he is a human being and his time out on unconventional parole is sugar coated with the re-occurring joke that he wants to have sex; this combining with the looming fact that towards the end, despite whatever he does to aid the capture\/demise of the baddie; he will have to serve his whole sentence.But there can be few complaints about 48 Hrs. For its day, I could probably estimate that the film was better than it looks and feels now what with the buddy genre so popular back then. Murphy has made his career on buddy films this, the Beverly Hills Cop film, Metro and hell; even the Shrek films are buddy flicks. But here, that old combination of white guy\/black guy is not only utilised to compliment the material but also as an excuse to include some really quite racial issues. After an obligatory opening when its established Cates is a cop with absolutely everything to loose, he turns to Hammond who 'knows the street' despite being away from it for two and a half years. From here, the white cop, black accomplice combination is played out to an effect seen in later films such as the third Die Hard picture. But the material on offer here is very racial Hammond is referred to behind his back as a 'soul brother' and is called 'charcoal' by Cates. Not only this but native Americans seem to get a bit of stick also. However, the one scene which balances it all up is the scene in the redneck bar in which Murphy rules the show. Yes, I 'got' the The French Connection reference when he parades them in the bar; publicly humiliating them as they stand there and he poses as a police man in what could be one of the most famous scenes from an 80s film.But apart from delve into some racial archetypes, the film keeps on a long and straight road; never veering off to be something it knows it cannot. The antagonists consist of their own interracial buddy two-some with Albert Ganz (Remar) and Ben Kehoe (James) forming their group and they get across a menacing persona that certainly remains there both on and off screen throughout. Even though 48 Hrs. is entertaining, it is only so because there is a nagging feeling at the back of the head that it's too familiar. Some of the decisions and reactions certain characters take and react to are fishy to say the least. One such scene near the beginning sees a police man on the stairs, bloody and shot, attempting to gun down a bad guy he has no bullets despite being off screen for a clear few minutes; did he not bother to check the chamber? Also, that same character decides to merely stand there when certain death looms and he is defenceless despite having a certain amount of time to get out of the situation. These scenes, like in any film, are incidental to the build up of the evil and menace of the antagonist who is the one that eventually kills him.Despite being involving and occasionally funny, the action scenes are messy and feel heavy handed at times with too many character a little too trigger happy. One character would rather shoot at Cates as he enters the apartment without any mention of anything he knows he's a cop (not sure how) and would prefer to murder him there and then than talk or merely initially run away. But this character is Luther (Kelly) and it is he who remains a constant and entertaining focus for the films middle segment. Everything seems to revolve around him as the antagonists have kidnapped his girlfriend as insurance; immediately having the audience 'side' with him. Luther acts as the reason for the cops and the robbers to combine in action sequences; the train station being a good example as well as the fetching of the car from the garage.If there are major complaints, it's that Hammond's re-occurring joke about wanting to have sex just goes too far; before long becoming insulting to the women he is talking to. There is also the very obvious air of the film dipping once it seems all is lost and the good guys have lost but wait, the bus that they were in; wasn't it from a certain place the cops know of?

I realize that 2008 marks the 35th anniversary of the film, but if it's anniversaries they're interested in, why not select a film with a little more punch &#150; say THE STING or American GRAFFITI &#150; or even if they wanted to go back 50 years to show us GIGI or VERTIGO &#150; something that opens this new initiative with a bang.But THE PAPER CHASE is what we got and so THE PAPER CHASE is what we'll deal with. I hadn't seen THE PAPER CHASE since I was fourteen years old or so and mostly remembered it as being boring and a little dull. I was excited to re-watch it on Reel 13 because I felt that now, as a more educated and hopefully more sophisticated viewer, I could fully appreciate it for the important work of art that it was supposed to be, but&#133;no &#150; it's still pretty boring.I don't mean to be flip about it. The more educated version of myself can now see why the film didn't work for me and ultimately, I think it boils down to the episodic nature of the piece. The film follows first year law student James T. Hart (Timothy Bottoms) on a series of misadventures and anecdotes mostly revolving around his borderline obsession with one of his professors, but also dabbles in his relationship with a local woman he meets, the lives of some of his fellow students, the pressure of finals, etc., etc. There are a number of good and interesting scenes in The Paper Chase (I particularly like the scene on the frozen lake and most of the study group scenes), but as a whole, they don't add up to much. The film doesn't have a sufficient overall arc or thru line and the result is a jumpy and disjointed narrative.Part and parcel with all that is the trouble with the romantic relationship between Hart and Susan, as played by Lindsay Wagner (who two years later would become television's original Bionic Woman). Firstly, they meet when Susan comes up to him randomly and abruptly on some Boston street and asks him to walk her to the corner because someone's following her. And he says he'll walk her all the way home. What??!?? Are you kidding? This is how our romantic leads meet? Then, on the walk home (we never see the alleged stalker, btw) all he does is ramble and babble about law school &#150; the Bionic Woman looks (appropriately) bored and disinterested. A few scenes later, he lurks outside her house, builds up the courage to knock on the door and she instantly invites him in. Cut to a light turning on when they are naked in bed. I mean, really??? I know the seventies where freewheeling and everything, but this is ridiculous (or am I the only person that these things don't happen to?). And then, in this post-coital scene, he starts philosophizing about law school AGAIN. I swear &#150; the BW has only had two or three lines of dialogue to this point. And wouldn't you know it, guess who's daughter Susan turns out to be? It's contrivances like those that can ruin a script\/film. Furthermore, I have long maintained that writers and filmmakers need to take the time to build a foundation for the important romantic relationships in a film. We need to understand and feel why two people like each other and are together. Bottoms and The Bionic Woman have absolutely zero chemistry together as actors and neither is their relationship strongly supported by the script. As one of the key (albeit tenuous) conflicts in the film is the balance between Hart's romance with Susan and his pursuit of good grades at Harvard Law School, the lack of effort put into the former does serious damage to the overall impact of the film. (Sidenote The relationship had some potential in the sense that both characters seemed to be separately obsessed with the same person. I thought this was kind of an interesting (and unique) idea and a potential building block for them, but the film doesn't capitalize on it nearly enough, instead letting it linger drifting in space).The film is mostly remembered for the performance by John Houseman as Professor Kingsfield. He won many accolades for the performance, including the Academy Award as Best Supporting Actor of the year. Now, Mr. Houseman's performance is fine &#150; after all, he was a stodgy and imperious professor at Julliard for twenty years before this so playing a stodgy and imperious professor at Harvard was hardly a stretch (as Neal Gabler jocularly hinted at during his opening remarks) &#150; and he has a lot of snappy, quotable lines of dialogue. However, I hardly felt he was Oscar-worthy. Houseman won the Oscar because he was a legendary theater producer and director (he worked with Orson Welles and the Mercury Theater, etc.) and it was a fun story that he was making his acting debut at the age of 71. If you really look back at that year, I think you have to say that the best supporting performance was Jason Miller as Father Damien in THE EXORCIST. I mean, he was amazing &#150; subtle and displayed lots of range.

I realize that 2008 marks the 35th anniversary of the film, but if it's anniversaries they're interested in, why not select a film with a little more punch &#150; say THE STING or American GRAFFITI &#150; or even if they wanted to go back 50 years to show us GIGI or VERTIGO &#150; something that opens this new initiative with a bang.But THE PAPER CHASE is what we got and so THE PAPER CHASE is what we'll deal with. I hadn't seen THE PAPER CHASE since I was fourteen years old or so and mostly remembered it as being boring and a little dull. I was excited to re-watch it on Reel 13 because I felt that now, as a more educated and hopefully more sophisticated viewer, I could fully appreciate it for the important work of art that it was supposed to be, but&#133;no &#150; it's still pretty boring.I don't mean to be flip about it. The more educated version of myself can now see why the film didn't work for me and ultimately, I think it boils down to the episodic nature of the piece. The film follows first year law student James T. Hart (Timothy Bottoms) on a series of misadventures and anecdotes mostly revolving around his borderline obsession with one of his professors, but also dabbles in his relationship with a local woman he meets, the lives of some of his fellow students, the pressure of finals, etc., etc. There are a number of good and interesting scenes in The Paper Chase (I particularly like the scene on the frozen lake and most of the study group scenes), but as a whole, they don't add up to much. The film doesn't have a sufficient overall arc or thru line and the result is a jumpy and disjointed narrative.Part and parcel with all that is the trouble with the romantic relationship between Hart and Susan, as played by Lindsay Wagner (who two years later would become television's original Bionic Woman). Firstly, they meet when Susan comes up to him randomly and abruptly on some Boston street and asks him to walk her to the corner because someone's following her. And he says he'll walk her all the way home. What??!?? Are you kidding? This is how our romantic leads meet? Then, on the walk home (we never see the alleged stalker, btw) all he does is ramble and babble about law school &#150; the Bionic Woman looks (appropriately) bored and disinterested. A few scenes later, he lurks outside her house, builds up the courage to knock on the door and she instantly invites him in. Cut to a light turning on when they are naked in bed. I mean, really??? I know the seventies where freewheeling and everything, but this is ridiculous (or am I the only person that these things don't happen to?). And then, in this post-coital scene, he starts philosophizing about law school AGAIN. I swear &#150; the BW has only had two or three lines of dialogue to this point. And wouldn't you know it, guess who's daughter Susan turns out to be? It's contrivances like those that can ruin a script\/film. Furthermore, I have long maintained that writers and filmmakers need to take the time to build a foundation for the important romantic relationships in a film. We need to understand and feel why two people like each other and are together. Bottoms and The Bionic Woman have absolutely zero chemistry together as actors and neither is their relationship strongly supported by the script. As one of the key (albeit tenuous) conflicts in the film is the balance between Hart's romance with Susan and his pursuit of good grades at Harvard Law School, the lack of effort put into the former does serious damage to the overall impact of the film. (Sidenote The relationship had some potential in the sense that both characters seemed to be separately obsessed with the same person. I thought this was kind of an interesting (and unique) idea and a potential building block for them, but the film doesn't capitalize on it nearly enough, instead letting it linger drifting in space).The film is mostly remembered for the performance by John Houseman as Professor Kingsfield. He won many accolades for the performance, including the Academy Award as Best Supporting Actor of the year. Now, Mr. Houseman's performance is fine &#150; after all, he was a stodgy and imperious professor at Julliard for twenty years before this so playing a stodgy and imperious professor at Harvard was hardly a stretch (as Neal Gabler jocularly hinted at during his opening remarks) &#150; and he has a lot of snappy, quotable lines of dialogue. However, I hardly felt he was Oscar-worthy. Houseman won the Oscar because he was a legendary theater producer and director (he worked with Orson Welles and the Mercury Theater, etc.) and it was a fun story that he was making his acting debut at the age of 71. If you really look back at that year, I think you have to say that the best supporting performance was Jason Miller as Father Damien in THE EXORCIST.

It was the second of four Martin made with director Carl Reiner. But its never achieved the classic status of The Jerk or The Man With Two Brains. And that's a shame. Because its one of the most ambitious and conceptually audacious films Martin has ever starred in.I get the impression not just any actor could have pulled this off, but Martin does. Very successfully too if I do say so. And I don't envy his task. He's starring in a film made up of many different clips from films of the 1940s and 50s. DMDWP is a film more smooth than it has a right to be. Thanks to Martin's perfect comic timing.The film is designed as an affectionate spoof of hard-boiled detective stories. And Martin is right at the centre of it as gumshoe Rigby Reardon. I won't bother going into detail about the plot. Probably because its best not to think about it too much while watching DMDWP. The amusement comes from Martin's deadpan Rigby, and how he plugs into the vast assortment of clips Reiner has put together.DMDWP is right out of a Raymond Chandler novel. Where detectives are hard-boiled burn outs and women are impeccably dressed and dripping with attitude. And makes it the springboard for one of the wackiest film-noirs you'll ever see.Just about every actor from the Golden Age of Cinema appears in DMDWP. Although Lauren Bacall is a conspicuous absentee. But its the way the film incorporates footage from more films than I can count that makes what you're seeing so special. We're talking about different classics, all with vastly different plots. And Reiner combines them in a way that verges on the inspired.Its all typical film-noir. Complete with dark alleys, femme fatales and exotic locales. Shot in beautifully crisp B&W. And right in the middle of it is a hair-dyed Steve Martin.His latest case is the murder of cheese-maker(!) Dr John Forrest. His daughter Juliet Forrest (Rachel Ward) brings Rigby in to do some investigating. I can't really say anymore, because its such a wacky investigation. But it includes everything from sucking bullets out of chest wounds, Rigby's custom-made Java to wearing a blonde wig and a dress.What a brilliant film this is! I have no idea when Reiner and Martin dreamt this up. And its a film that shouldn't even begin to work. But oddly enough it does. The filmmakers have set themselves a real arduous task. But somehow they take these wildly different plots from all over the place and turn it into an almost cohesive film. Remember, I said almost!OK, I'll be honest with you. DMDWP doesn't always make a lot of sense. But then film-noir usually doesn't. Even Raymond Chandler had trouble keeping up with The Big Sleep while he was writing it! But the fact that the film makes any kind of coherent sense at all is down to Steve Martin.He has seldom been better in anything else. Martin was still in his crazed, manic man phase, so the role of Rigby Reardon was something of a pleasant diversion. Martin was a real trooper. Going far above and beyond the call of duty. Most of the time he has to talk to thin air. While the footage is incorporated at a later date. I suppose you can tell where the reality ends and the footage begins. It is noticeably grainier, but Martin makes sure every scene hits it's mark.There are so many great little gags. Particularly inspired is the way DMDWP takes scenes from these films that are meant to be deadly serious and reworks them through clever editing and Martin's reactions so they become comedic instead. I especially loved Rigby's conversations with Humphrey Bogart's Philip Marlowe. And the scene where he throttles Bette Davis is unnerving.Martin gets a lot of droll dialogue that he delivers to perfection. I had no idea that he had such a talent for deadpan humour. And he gets to show off his talent for physical comedy too. The scene where he makes coffee has to be seen to be believed. I don't want to spoil it for you, but it provides one of the greatest sight gags you'll ever see.Aside from Martin, the only other person who provides a human element is Rachel Ward. She certainly looks enticing, but she is occasionally a little bland. She never quite sizzles the way you expect her to.But that doesn't matter. Because this is Martin's show. DMDWP was also one of the rare occasions where he had the opportunity to flex his considerable skills as a writer. I'm sure he's tailored a few situations to match his talents. But whether it calls for him to be deadpan or (occasionally) manic, Martin does brilliantly.Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid does admittedly run out of steam about 10 minutes before the end. As soon as it runs out of clips to use, the film loses some momentum. But even still, its a very, very good film indeed. One of Steve Martin's best. A tightly plotted, gag-packed laugh-a-thon that doesn't deserve obscurity. And getting to see Martin with dark hair is worth the price of admission alone!

Critics downgraded each for its brutal violence and frank sexuality. However, loosened standards have since allowed a re-evaluation, with the latter now being hailed as a classic of the genre, at the same time, the cult status of Combo's director Joseph Lewis, has helped lift the reputation of this work. Still and all, if Combo was under-rated upon release, I think there's good reason for believing it's now over-rated.First and foremost is Cornel Wilde as Detective Diamond. He simply lacks the on-screen gravitas to make his role compelling enough to compete with heavy-weight nemesis Richard Conte as the ethnically-cleansed Mr. Brown. Conte is convincing; unfortunately, Wilde is not. Thus their pivotal vendetta lacks the force and clash that the film needs. Also, Jean Wallace (Wilde's real life wife) may look the silken mistress part, but when she opens her mouth, only a whiney sound comes out. Male actors have been criticized for voice quality-- so why not the dis-staff side. Couple that with a limited range of expression, and we've got a pair of very pretty department store manikins in the leads. My guess is that the producers got the couple at a discount, always a big factor for independent productions like this. But whatever the reason, impact is undercut by principal casting.The script may be adventurous, but the plot is a muddle. Maybe you can follow the complications, I couldn't-- nor after a certain point did I want to try. Phillip Yordan may have been a top Hollywood scripter; however his attention here went into the kinky aspects and not the logic. He's simply inserted too many elements into the plot without blending them effectively. The result is a confusing sprawl that tries to do too much with a large cast of characters, and not even director Lewis's cult status cuts through the thickets. Then too, John Alton's celebrated noir photography is piled on in heavy-handed fashion. Just count the number of scenes in half-light, mist, fog, or heavy fog.

Nonetheless, without some natural contrast, expressionist lighting loses force and becomes tediously ineffectual, as happens here.None of this is meant to imply that the movie is without interest. But that interest is now mainly for movie historians. Combo represents a stage in the evolution of what could be shown or even implied on the big screen. As TV began eating away at Hollywood's traditional audience, the movies countered with fare more adult than married couples in twin beds. Thus Combo dares to imply a gay relationship between Van Cleef and Holliman, and a deeply erotic one between Conte and Wallace. Even Wilde's status as a cop has a dark side in his compromising links with stripper Stanley and underworld mistress Wallace. But what was daring then has largely become cliché now. Thus the film has lost much of its original novelty, which is not to say that it's lost entertainment value.

Watch it today - devoid of such high expectations - and you know what? It's still weak.An overview of history from caveman days to the French Revolution, History Of The World Part 1 introduces us to such characters as Moses, Comicus the Roman stand-up philosopher, and King Louis XVI, all played by Brooks' favorite actor - Mel himself. In various bits, we see man emerge from erotically fixated primitives to erotically fixated primitives with silly wigs.History Of The World is really two mini-movies, one about Comicus the Roman and the other a Tale Of Two Cities parody of the French Revolution in which King Louis is replaced by a lowly lookalike, played of course by Mel. A few other bits are thrown around in the way of padded one-liners, but it's really more like Brooks couldn't be bothered with shooting a full-length movie this time. The French one at least is funny in parts, but much of what shows up on screen seems too thin for a story conference, let alone a movie.And the jokes! Puerile third-grade schoolyard stuff. In the year 1,000,000 BC, it is thought the first homo sapien marriage occurred, intones Orson Welles as we watch caveman Sid Caesar club a woman over the head. It was shortly followed by the first homosexual marriage. The Rome segment is just bizarre, with pointless cameos from Hugh Hefner and Henny Youngman and a long joke involving a chariot with a giant reefer.I believe Brooks' gradual decline as a filmmaker had to do with his increased focus on himself as central presence, and he really makes a case for it here. Why, in a film co-starring one of the great song-and-dance men of his generation, Gregory Hines, do you have the one big song-and-dance number star Mel Brooks?At least the French segment works somewhat in the classic Brooks vein, with some familiar faces from his other movies getting some quality time like Harvey Korman, Andreas Voutsinas, and Cloris Leachman, in the last of her Brooks crone roles as bitter Madame Defarge We are so poor, we don't even have a language, just a stupid accent!It's also the segment that delivers the best lines. It's good to be the king is what Louis says after molesting various ladies of the court, and Brooks is just right for the part there, probably because he WAS the king on the set and knew what he was talking about. Korman's Wait for the shake is also a favorite of mine, right up there with Walk this way and Where the white women at? from past Brooks' classics.But why Mel thought a chess gangbang would be so funny is lost on me, as is the comedy potential of a burping Dom DeLuise, or Jews being tortured by nuns in bathing suits. Call it hubris, but the sad fact was, for its many faults, History would be the last Brooks comedy that got within shouting distance of his Blazing Saddles peak. He could have just have easily subtitled this Decline And Fall.

The Rome segment is just bizarre, with pointless cameos from Hugh Hefner and Henny Youngman and a long joke involving a chariot with a giant reefer.I believe Brooks' gradual decline as a filmmaker had to do with his increased focus on himself as central presence, and he really makes a case for it here. Why, in a film co-starring one of the great song-and-dance men of his generation, Gregory Hines, do you have the one big song-and-dance number star Mel Brooks?At least the French segment works somewhat in the classic Brooks vein, with some familiar faces from his other movies getting some quality time like Harvey Korman, Andreas Voutsinas, and Cloris Leachman, in the last of her Brooks crone roles as bitter Madame Defarge We are so poor, we don't even have a language, just a stupid accent!It's also the segment that delivers the best lines. It's good to be the king is what Louis says after molesting various ladies of the court, and Brooks is just right for the part there, probably because he WAS the king on the set and knew what he was talking about. Korman's Wait for the shake is also a favorite of mine, right up there with Walk this way and Where the white women at? from past Brooks' classics.But why Mel thought a chess gangbang would be so funny is lost on me, as is the comedy potential of a burping Dom DeLuise, or Jews being tortured by nuns in bathing suits.

Watch it today - devoid of such high expectations - and you know what? It's still weak.An overview of history from caveman days to the French Revolution, History Of The World Part 1 introduces us to such characters as Moses, Comicus the Roman stand-up philosopher, and King Louis XVI, all played by Brooks' favorite actor - Mel himself. In various bits, we see man emerge from erotically fixated primitives to erotically fixated primitives with silly wigs.History Of The World is really two mini-movies, one about Comicus the Roman and the other a Tale Of Two Cities parody of the French Revolution in which King Louis is replaced by a lowly lookalike, played of course by Mel.

Sadly, The Return of Jafar, while not exactly bad, seems more like a cheap parody of the theatrical Disney blockbuster than a sequel, and the same can probably be said about the Aladdin TV series. Fortunately, at least that isn't the case with Aladdin and the King of Thieves, the final installment in the movie trilogy, which concluded this particular Disney franchise.Aladdin and Princess Jasmine are finally getting married, but their wedding is interrupted by the Forty Thieves, who raid the place! The bride and groom, along with the Genie and others, successfully fight the thieves off, but the wedding is still ruined, as the pavilion has been destroyed. After this, Aladdin finds a staff, which is what the Forty Thieves were after! Inside this staff is an oracle, which can come out and answer one question! Desperate to learn more about his past, Aladdin thinks long and hard about what question to ask the oracle, and finally decides to ask her about his long-lost father. She directs him to the secret lair of the Forty Thieves, so he is convinced that his father is their prisoner, and sets out to rescue him. However, once he arrives at their lair, he soon learns that his father is not their prisoner, but their king! This movie shows a return to form for some of the characters. In The Return of Jafar, Aladdin and Princess Jasmine seem silly and less mature, but in The King of Thieves, they are back to the way they originally were. Another character who shows a return to form in this final installment in the trilogy is the Genie. Robin Williams as the Genie is one of the main merits of the first Aladdin, and the character isn't nearly as funny with Dan Castellaneta providing his voice in The Return of Jafar and the Aladdin TV series. However, with Robin Williams back, the Genie is once again hilarious! Aside from the characters, this second straight-to-video Aladdin sequel also has better animation than the first, though not quite as good as the stunning animation in the original.I must confess I didn't like this movie quite as much the last time I saw it as I did when I saw it last year, which was the first time I saw it in many years. I found some parts a bit bland, and like The Return of Jafar, most its songs are forgettable. I also didn't find quite as much excitement in it this time. However, overall, it had enough to impress me, with its humour, animation, and some reasonable adventure. It's definitely a stronger effort than the middle film. So, if you've seen The Return of Jafar and were severely disappointed by it, so you decided there was no point in watching Aladdin and the King of Thieves, assuming it would be the same or worse, you might want to reconsider. While not nearly as good or memorable as the original theatrical film, it could be worthwhile.

If you want a relatively simple story built around nonstop fun, action, shooting, and fistfights, Cliffhanger is definitely the kind of movie that will suit you. It is the perfect, late-night, enjoy-the-ride film since it keeps you riveted and entertained. It is Sylvester Stallone's best action picture since First Blood and still remains one of his better.The plot of the film is very simple. Mountain climbers are forced by terrorists to find lost bags of loot that they need in order to flee the country. Along the way, friends are endangered, they encounter the hostilities of nature, and are struggling to beat the other side while the FBI wants to end everything right away. Sure, that's not particularly complex or original. But when it's done right, a simple plot like that can turn into an effective movie.The film is elaborately designed and performed. It was shot on a real mountain range, and therefore, the scenery looks breathtakingly beautiful, especially when combined with the memorable music score. Sure, the rock climbing techniques done by Sylvester Stallone and Michael Rooker aren't entirely accurate. The bolt gun that Stallone uses is something that no real rock climber would dare use. And some incredible things happen. Such as a character falling into freezing cold water without a shirt on, climbing back out, and ending up just fine. But it's just a fun movie and should be treated as such.Cliffhanger might be too violent for some people to enjoy. The body count is fairly high, there is a fair share of blood (although it's not used too recklessly), and it could be just too intense for some.

It is simply an awesome movie with a well deserved reputation for being such. See for yourself.

The title refers to the wild mustangs they hunt, but it also describes the 4 main characters, each lost in a world they hardly recognize. At one point Monroe points to a mountain vista and says it's like a dream. Each of the characters is wounded and lost in some way. Marilyn Monroe plays a divorcée trying to figure out what to do next. Clark Gable plays a cowboy in a vanishing west. Montgomery Clift plays a rancher cheated out of his legacy when his mother remarries. Eli Wallach plays a guy whose life has come to a standstill after the death of his wife. The characters circle each other, trying to make connections, but their timing is always off. Gable and Monroe seem to find something until they go on the mustang hunt.Gable is magnificent as the aging cowboy who fears working for wages as the final sign of giving in to the commonplace and losing the old west. But the old west is, of course, already lost. Most of the action takes place in and around Reno, the perfect symbol for what the west has become. His drunk scene (after he has seen his kids) is astonishing in its pain and ugliness. It's a great performance.Monroe is stunning and gives a quiet and simple performance that shows what she could have done (had she lived). Leaving her dumb blonde persona in the dust, what we get here is Monroe the actress, and she's just plain terrific. Aside from the scene (done in a long shot) where she rages at the men after they have captured the horses, Monroe plays this character very quietly and with lots of small reactions (watch her eyes). It's a great performance.Clift and Wallach do wonders with their characters and provide a lot of the tension since all three men pursue Monroe. Thelma Ritter is solid as Isabelle. Estelle Winwood has an odd role as the old lady collecting money. James Barton and Kevin McCarthy have small roles.I think THE MISFITS is a must see for any serious film buff. The film collapsed under the weight of its publicity in 1961 and there was a huge backlash when Gable died within 2 weeks of finishing the film. Yet the film is gorgeous, a shimmering Arthur Miller poem to the worlds and people we've lost.

It's strengthened by its brilliant performances capturing mostly decent people struggling to survive in the sewer without becoming tainted by it. The fictional John Doe would most likely agree with all these theoretical snapshots of despair - the difference comes in his psychopathic desire to come up with a plan that he thinks will solve it.Few forms of popular entertainment manage to afford the villain his say whilst still maintaining a sensible distance from his horrific acts. What I like best is the film's depressing contention that there isn't as much distinction as we think between the good guys and the bad guys. We're all affected by the distasteful aspects of society, but do we just hope that our own positive contributions will be enough to offset them - or in extreme situations, when we stare into the abyss, will the abyss stare back at us? Some may well be upset that the killer's justification contains reasoned objections. It is really only by resorting to crime that he reveals himself as a madman. Rather than be outraged, though, I prefer to celebrate good writing that allows us to see hidden facets of an issue, however unpalatable the resultant consequences of such a viewpoint may turn out to be.

While it sheds a number of supporting characters from the previous films as well as the formula of terrorists taking over some building, it gains an able co-star in Samuel L. Jackson, a good villain, more twists and turns than the previous films, a better story than Die Hard 2 and a handful of supporting characters that aren't distractingly ridiculous.The story is this A madman named Simon wants McClane dead and will blow up all of Manhattan to get it. Of course, there are lots of twists and complications that show up to make this more than just the story of a mad bomber vs. McClane. The twists and turns are mostly convincing, only occasionally stretching the bounds of believability. One issue with the story is that it basically ignores Die Hard 2 in continuity, so it confused me when McClane at the beginning states that the distance between NY and LA caused a rift between him and his wife--in DH2, McClane became an LAPD officer and was in DC for a little bit. But besides the continuity confusion and the regular contrivances in action movies of this type, the story is a workable piece, helped in part by adding a personal story for its leading character, which was sorely missing in DH2.The action itself doesn't quite hit the highs of Die Hard or the ridiculousness of Die Hard 2, but still manages to be engaging and entertaining. Furthermore, the inclusion of puzzles and riddles and obstacle-course like challenges are surprisingly entertaining. The pacing suffers a little when unnecessary story elements rear their head--some elements, like multiple criminal organizations--seem to have been written out, but not completely, leading to some confusion.The direction is engaging if plain, the acting rapport is good, the production values are high and the movie is generally fun. While DHwaV doesn't reach the same highs at Die Hard, in getting a chance to break free from the formula and follow a different path, it becomes something that's almost engaging and fun as the previous Die Hard. As such, it's an enjoyable film that will sate your desire for a fun action movie, but as with previous Die Hard films, you shouldn't expect a moving or intellectually or emotionally compelling work.
