[{"date":"23 August 2002","score":"","review":"  Contains SpoilersI Am ENORMOUS Friday The 13th Fan. I've watched all of them a few times, and now it's newest addition to the pathetic JASON GOES TO HELL hits the big screens here in Australia. Well in one word, all i can say is that i'm really DISAPPOINTED.There are numerous reasons as to why this film was a disappointing run in the series. Firstly, it is set in space. How can they damage the series so much by setting it 450 years into the future? Weren't they thinking? They have permanently scarred the Friday series- I think to a point, that it's too late for a Come Back.There were many CONS in this film, that i will list first. (**MINOR SPOILERS**)Second Con- This film isn't CAMPY, the series used to have this feeling to it, that not many films did. The creepy atmosphere of the lakes, cabins, woods. It was great. Now we are thrown into space - something that resembles Star Trek. There is no Astmosphere, the film is REALLY Cheesy, but it's not Campy, and thats what i miss most about the series.Third Con- the acting was DISMAL, by the Entire cast. Not one member of the cast proved themselves to be talented actors\/actresses. Though i will admit that NO Friday film had much Talent- Yet this had to have the worst.Fourth Con- why the HELL is this film funny? Why have they taken the edge off the Jason Films? They have plagued this script, with INSANE one liners, they have made the mistake of what happened to the NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET SERIES from part 4- It's comical. People want to be scared, this didn't serve up as a horror film to me. Im sure MILD humor is appreciated in a horror film, but they honestly stretched it here, it came to the point where EVERY CHARACTER in the film said some STUPID line before they were killed by Jason.Fifth Con- The plot, in a way it is Original. Yet was THIS the only thing they could come up with?? Jason in Space? Original? Sure... ACCEPTABLE? HELL NO! Jason should be in the woods, thats where he belongs, all this Body Freezing - Time Warping and Star-ships were making me sick.Sixth Con- The Ending.Most Jason films had a cool ending, which would leave you Grasping for the next sequel. the Ending to JASON X was really lame. It was a Conclusive ending, so there wasn't really an End. It was really dumb how Jason and the Space dude, flew down from space to earth and Landed EXACTLY at Crystal lake? Its funny how they didn't discintegrate on their way down. It's also funny how those two lovers at the end, point to Jason and that Space Dude flying down from the air and say Look- it's a flying star...Ohhh it's SUCH a fairy-tale ending.Seventh Con- The Music. I REALLY Disliked the musical score of Jason X, it's the worst musical score since FRIDAY THE 13th PART 3. It was very repetative, and didn't have any build-up.Eighth Con- Special Effects. Seeming this was shot in Space- Special Effects are a very vital form to this movie- and the Special Effects were cheap and corny. The Space-ship Section looked like a floating webcam- im serious. When the ship would get VERY damaged and crash into citys, landing bays, docks, and other Ships, it explodes from the outside, and inside all the people are just holding on as the camera shakes a little bit- like in the power rangers. If they HAD to make this film in space, they could have at least TRIED to make the Special Effects look good.HERE ARE THE FEW PROS IN THE MOVIE.First Pro- Jason New look. For the fast hour, Jason is plain old Jason, with the hockey mask, and hey thats cool. After getting his head blown off, he re-transforms, and has a new Metal mask, and i think it looks cool. Jason looks pretty creepy, and his Body-guard looks VERY good.Second Pro- Kane Hodder. The Man BEHIND Jasons mask. He plays his parts very well, although not his best, he does look like he usualy does, really big-stocky and strong. He is the BEST Jason, thats for sure.Third Pro- The Death Scenes. Jason is quiet Original with his deaths, he kills with creativity, and thats what i like. A girl gets her face frozen, and he smashes her face on the wall. Also a man falling into a Giant screw, and a FUNNY death is when Jason is smashing one girl into another girl. Very well done in this part.Fourth Pro- Attractive Cast. Wow the women were reallt stunning this film. This ALWAYS help a friday film by a few percent. Unfortunantley watching them die off aint so pretty.Fitfth Pro- Good Flashbacks. For a Brief moment in JASON X you are sent back or JASON is Sent back to Crystal Lake. It looks so cool how they did it, one VERY funny thing is that Jason is asked by two attractive 80's girls, if he wants to smoke pot with them and have Pre-marital sex because They love it. Jason teaches them a thing or two after that. It was nice to see that glimpse of Crystal Lake- Oh how it will be missed.Thats my conclusion. I am a BIG Jason Fan, and i must admit JASON X has lowered my faith in the series. Yet this isn't the WORST of the series. It is better than parts (5,8 & 9) .So it's basically one of the worst Jason flicks, but i think its unfair to skip it. Especially if you are a fan, there are SOME redeeming qualities in the film. So i advise you check it out, dont expect anything great at all, and try to come with a Comical sense, instead of a Serious one. There were only TEN people in the Cinema watching this film and 3 people walked out, i find NO reason to walk out of this film. But i think its only Normal to leave the cinema with a feeling of Disappointment** (2 stars) - out of 5.
