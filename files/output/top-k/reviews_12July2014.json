[{"date":"12 July 2014","score":"","review":" Scream was excellent. Scream 2 was garbage, awful, useless, and too brutal. Scream 3 is at least half as good as its first instalment, Scream. Scream 3 is good because it's different, as much as it is the same. It, at one time, overtook Scream, and became my favourite of the Scream films, (before i went back to placing the best, and original one as my first) and i genuinely, and proudly, place it as my second favourite of all four. Scream 3 sees Sidney Prescott, Gale Weathers, and Dewey Riley, yet again come across a killer wearing the Ghostface mask - a different killer, of course. With better moments, a little stronger acting, and less brutality, more-focused slasher-like killings, Scream 3 delivers greatness as a third and final (at the time) instalment in the (at the time)trilogy. Of course, Scream 4 was then released years later, and it's not as good. Scream 3, from me, gets an 8.1 out of 10. ***\/***** ","genre":null},{"date":"12 July 2014","score":"","review":" Scream was excellent. Scream 2 was garbage, awful, useless, and too brutal.

Scream was released and it was met with great, positive reviews, and it's considered one of the best slasher movies ever made; even if it's from the 1990s and not the 1980s, and then came this - a more-violent, brutal gore-(like)-fest that's just boring and creates a mess around its viewers. Scream 2 is garbage compared to the first film, however, it's still worth the watch. It's just not as good; even if it's got most of the original stars from the first film, including the mains. I just found it shallow, boring, gorier, and pathetic if being compared to the wonderful original. Scream 2 is nothing more than an unsuccessful sequel and really proves that a majority of most film sequels, or horror-related film sequels, are bad. Not all, but most. Scream 2 - 4.5 out of 10. *(1\/2)\/***** ","genre":null},{"date":"12 July 2014","score":"0 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Oh, man. Why?
