I happen to love it. I consider it to be not only the best dog movie ever made, but also among my 10 most favourite movies of all time (yes, including Casablanca, The Thin Man, Gun Crazy, Chinatown, etc.). What makes this movie so wonderful is Higgins, the dog (under the direction of his trainer, Frank Inn). Higgins was so far beyond other dog actors that it is impossible to explain to folks who don't own dogs or train dogs. Not only is he cute and photogenic, expressive and believable, he did all his own stunts -- and he was 14 years old when he made this film!!!Folks who review this movie tend to mention the kid actors, or the creaky kidnapping plot -- but, you know, that's not the point. If you wanted to look at it that way, you could also mention the wonderful interactions between Higgins and Edgar Buchanan, an actor he had worked with for many years on the TV series Petticoat Junction. Those scenes have a delightful sense of improvisation and charm that easily offset the whiny kid scenes. But the movie is not really about those kidnapped kids at all. It is about a small dog, his daily routines, and how, when those routines are broken, he must rise above his simple life and accomplish a great deed. In a way, the film that Benji most closely resembles is Buster Keaton's magnificent silent classic, The General. The slow, repetitious set-up of Keaton with his train and Higgins with his rounds about town, the focused realism, the slightly down-at-the-heels outsiderness of the hero, the hint of love about to blossom if only the hero can provide for his beloved, the insistently lengthy attention paid to the immediacy of ultra-mundane cause and effect -- these are the same in both films. The openings have a documentary quality to them -- until, without warning, all hell breaks loose and the plot comes crashing in. Keaton's train is stolen! Kidnappers come to Benji's home! Then, in both films, we see an under-dog, so to speak, rise to the challenge of events and, working with only the slenderest of means and very little advance planning, counter one villainous turn after another, all the while attempting to right the wrongs that have been committed. The manner in which the heroes devise solutions to the problems they face, both in The General and in Benji, flow logically from the daily routines we saw them perform in the documentary-like first halves of the films, so they seem believable. We gain confidence alongside the heroes, see the sense in what they are doing, cheer for them to triumph, watch them rise to the verge of success -- and then a huge blow falls, a colossal set-back occurs, and we feel despair -- they'll never make it now, too much time and too much ground have been lost! But again, they apply themselves to the task, and now we hope against hope that they will be able to pull it off in time ... except that most people watching The General experience jaw-dropping amazement at the stunts and most people watching Benji really have no idea how great Higgins' stunt-work really is, and spend the last third of the movie in tears because Benji is such a small dog, and he's so dang CUTE, and ... awwww. I've watched The General at least 10 times and never cried once. I've watched Benji 10 times and cried every time. I cried just know, merely writing about it. But Benji is not just a cute dog movie, any more than The General is just a Buster Keaton comedy. Like the best of Keaton's work, it is a heroic movie, and a love story, and a story of physical action and bravery. I just love this movie, that's all.

","genre":"Horror"},{"date":"14 October 2006","score":"30 out of 35 people found the following review useful","review":" I've just read all of the reviews on this film on this site and nobody even mentions what this film is really about. Like any good horror story it works on different levels. Like the Zombie films of George Romero there's an underlying message to this film that has nothing to do with it's horror exterior. But you have to think about what Michael Almereyda is trying to say with this story. This isn't just true of this film, but of all good horror. Dr. Jeckyle and Mr.Hyde-Addiction to substances, Frankenstein-Man playing at being God, Dracula-Hate poisoning the mind and soul. The main theme of this film is wanting to change your life but not being able to escape your old habits and break loose. It's even mentioned outright several times during the film by different characters. There's a lot of philosophical discussions by different characters on this through the film.This film has black humor, meaning of life philosophy, camera work that serves a purpose to enhance the story and heart felt dramatic performances by all of the actors and actresses. One of the things that I really like about this film, (and one of the things that many people didn't understand or like) was the use of the toy camera pixel-vision effect. I found it to be a perfect way of economically expressing the intoxicating effect of being under the influence of a vampire. If you watch the film and think about the scenes where it's employed it will be obvious. It isn't just a random attempt to be arty as many of the reviewers seem to think. It's a visual depiction of the impaired state of mind that you might experience if a vampire was psychically manipulating a mortal. And it enhances the film it doesn't detract from it. Whether you like it or not, film-making is an art. Just like painting, drawing, writing or any other form of expression. Some filmmakers just don't have any sense of art, they only wish to mindlessly entertain. That's why people say things like TV rots your mind. Well, I guess that if you watch anything in a mindless manor that could be true. But film that has something to say, something to think about is a worthwhile use of time and intellect.I have a fairly large collection of horror films and Art House and I can tell you that Nadja is one of my all time favorites. Every time I watch it I see something new, get a different little joke or notice different connections that I didn't get before. I also enjoy many of the Mindless entertainment variety of Vampire films,and so a quote from the writer David Goyer who wrote the screenplays for Blade, Sometimes you just want to see somebody kick some ass!.Most people don't realize how huge the genre of Vampire Cinema really is. Dracula is the definitely the most filmed character in film history, and the greater tree of Vampire films in world cinema is so big that it almost impossible to accurately list. Of the Art House and Vintage, comedy and Vampire Hunter categories I would recommend checking out some of my favorites. Many Vampire films are a hybrid of two or more of these categories,but they all have different points that I find attractive,humorous, exciting, entertaining and thought provoking. Again, I haven't seen but a small selection of the huge list of Vampire cinema, so it's likely that I'll be leaving out many excellent selections and maybe some of your favorites in this list. I'm giving this list because the film Nadja could very well be enjoyed if you like some of the films that I like and have been entertained by.Art House and Vintage Nosferatu 1922 (The original granddaddy Vampire film from the silent era. The Kino Version is worth paying for with an excellent soundtrack option featuring musicians from Art Zoid), Nosferatu the Vampyre (Werner Herzog), Shadow of the Vampire (a fun comedy-fictional story based around the making of F.W. Murnau's Nosferatu-1922), Vampyr (Carl Theodor Dreyer's atmospheric masterpiece, even though part's of the film were created by accident!),Dracula (1931), The Hammer Dracula series (feartuing the great Christopher Lee), Dracula-Pages from a Virgin's diary (a modern silent film of a Canadian Ballet company filmed by Guy Madden), Blood for Dracula (also known as Andy Worhol's Dracula), Immortality, Ganja and Hess, Habit, Near Dark, Salem's Lot (Based on the novel by Stephan King-the original mini-series, I haven't seen the newer remake) Bram Stoker's Dracula (The love it or hate it classic by F. Coppola). Some of my favorites from the Vampire Hunter sub-genre The Blade Series (Again one of those Love it or hate it series for some.), John Carpenter's Vampires (This one is hard to classify, lots of comedy too.), The Captain Kronos-Vampire Hunter films by Hammer studios, The Forsaken, and the British TV series Ultraviolet (an X-Files type mini-series). Also worth mention is the Japanese-Anime films Vampire Hunter D-Bloodlust (You'll forget that you're watching a cartoon, the story's that good!), and Blood-The last Vampire (A short but well done film).Some of the comedy genre Innocent Blood, Modern Vampires, The Breed, Dusk to Dawn (I've only seen the first one, a hybrid of Tarantino's crime style and Robert Rodriguez's horror style), Vampire's Kiss, and Interview with the Vampire (I find this Ann Rice film quite comedic), and Lost Boys (A local favorite being that I live in Santa Cruz).Nadja is one of the jewels of my collection because it is truly a multi-faceted piece of film-making that defies categorization.

Like any good horror story it works on different levels. Like the Zombie films of George Romero there's an underlying message to this film that has nothing to do with it's horror exterior. But you have to think about what Michael Almereyda is trying to say with this story. This isn't just true of this film, but of all good horror. Dr. Jeckyle and Mr.Hyde-Addiction to substances, Frankenstein-Man playing at being God, Dracula-Hate poisoning the mind and soul. The main theme of this film is wanting to change your life but not being able to escape your old habits and break loose. It's even mentioned outright several times during the film by different characters. There's a lot of philosophical discussions by different characters on this through the film.This film has black humor, meaning of life philosophy, camera work that serves a purpose to enhance the story and heart felt dramatic performances by all of the actors and actresses. One of the things that I really like about this film, (and one of the things that many people didn't understand or like) was the use of the toy camera pixel-vision effect. I found it to be a perfect way of economically expressing the intoxicating effect of being under the influence of a vampire. If you watch the film and think about the scenes where it's employed it will be obvious. It isn't just a random attempt to be arty as many of the reviewers seem to think. It's a visual depiction of the impaired state of mind that you might experience if a vampire was psychically manipulating a mortal. And it enhances the film it doesn't detract from it.

About two years ago I had been flipping through stations on TV and stopped on a movie with Mickey Rourke and a bearded Robert De Niro. Already I was hooked, but it wasn't just the presence of these two actors that had me watching, it was the look and feel of the film. Considering I had only caught the last ten minutes of the movie, I was completely engrossed. But it wasn't until earlier this year that I was finally able to sit through the entire movie.The story of Angel Heart is one of noir essence accompanied by overwhelming dread. It begins in 1950's New York, with Harry Angel (Mickey Rourke), a low class gumshoe with quite a low prolific career. In his office, he gets a call from a potential client's lawyer, asking him to meet him in of all places, a Harlem church. The client in question is Louis Cyphre (Robert De Niro), a mysterious figure who offers Harry a case Find Johnny Favourite, a war veteran and jazz singer who went missing after returning from the war.. This seemingly simplistic case takes Angel from the roughness of New York to the steamy bayous of New Orleans. As he investigates Favourite's disappearance, he finds himself in the middle of something far more sinister than he ever suspected.As a through-back to the detective thrillers of the 40's and 50's, Angel Heart takes us to places that weren't often traveled in thrillers of the 80's. We're taken to the backwoods of Louisiana where locals practice Voodoo, jazz clubs where classic sounds are still new, and seedy motels that make alleys look like suites at the Ritz-Carlton. There aren't many clean places in the film and it rains in nearly every scene. Writer-director Alan Parker creates a world where only the noir exists and darkness is constant.But this is not a genre film in the conventional sense. Parker keeps most of the story within the nostalgic South and even adds Satanism to the mix. Eventually, the movie begins to completely turn away from its noir roots and becomes surrealistic horror.In what can be called a virtuoso performance, Mickey Rourke gives Angel a perfect glibness that makes his journey all the more surprising. Balancing pompousness with certain professional drive, Rourke perfectly captures a down and out gumshoe. Sharing his every scene with Rourke, De Niro shines in a purposely understated role. As Cyphre, De Niro is at his most stoic and creepy in only a few scenes.At the time of its release, the real interest of the movie came in the appearance of then Cosby Kid Lisa Bonet. As the gorgeous but mysterious Epiphany Proudfoot, she gives an against type performance that showed its power by getting her fired on the role that made her famous. The sex scene that most scarred her innocent persona is anything but sexy and is something you have to see for yourself.For me though, the ultimate standout of the film's legacy lies in the brilliant cinematography by Michael Seresin. In terms of capturing a film's visuals with its atmosphere, Seresin's photography is some of the best I've seen in the horror genre or any other. Along with Seresin, Parker uses another one of his regulars, Trevor Jones, to create the perfectly toned music for the film.Angel Heart is a prime example of a filmmaker creating a perfectly envisioned piece of work. Everything about the movie fits the genre to a perfect pitch and follows its dark visage to the very end. Criminally underrated at the time of its release, its finally found an audience ever since its release on DVD, and rightfully so. A horror film this brilliant shouldn't be missed by anyone remotely interested in horror or mystery films.

I was past the kids and tweens age and what I remember most about this is the harsh reaction it got from critics. I remember parent's groups screaming about how bad and violent Monster Squad was for their kids. But ya know what... this was a good monster film for kids and teens. I'm surprised they haven't made a sequel. They really should have.I've got to call on my fellow movie junkies from the late 60's and 70's when we were toddlers and children watching TV for this one. Remember when they showed us the old Universal Films late at night -- Dracula, The Wolfman, The Invisible Man, The Mummy, Frankenstein and the gang? Remember the 'all day' Thanksgiving Godzilla marathons? And remember these shows as a kid Creature Feature, Chiller, The CBS Friday Night Late Movie, Dr. Shock, Joe Bob Briggs, Elvira and many more across the USA? This film is for OUR kids - make no mistake. The other kids, well, they missed out.Monster Squad was done in the best possible light - it didn't talk down to kids and put them in control when the adults wouldn't believe them that Monsters were taking over their town.

They are brought to America where they are put on trial for murder. Also, three separate parties are trying to decide who the slaves rightfully belong to. Now, a young lawyer named Baldwin is assigned to defend the slaves, and he enlists the help of ex-president John Quincy Adams to speak for them. This movie is well directed, and well acted, and well written. Unfortunately, it doesn't have much of an entertainment factor.I think it's fair to say that Steven Spielberg is one of the most talented director's of our time. His movies are always very well made. Some are made for pure entertainment, and some are made with entertainment and a message. Unfortunately, this movie is just a message. Now I'm not saying this movie is bad. Far from it. This movie is as well written and directed as all of Spielberg's films. It has a very noble message that's worth listening to, and it's very historically accurate. It's just that this movie isn't very entertaining. When I say that I mean that this isn't a movie that you say to yourself, I feel like watching Amistad, and you invite some friends over and cook up some popcorn. You can't even watch this by yourself. It's a great docudrama for history class, and it's good to watch once just to see it.The acting in this movie is very good. Everybody does great in their roles, but obviously the best performance came from Anthony Hopkins as John Quincy Adams. He gives an amazing speech in the courtroom at the end of the movie that deserves to be on a list of greatest speeches on film.Overall, I highly recommend this movie to everyone, but it isn't a movie that you'll want to watch over and over.7\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"14 October 2006","score":"","review":" Amistad tells the true story of a group of slaves en route to America who break free and revolt, killing the crew of the Amistad.

Captain Ahab, the god of the Pequod, champion of darkness. Gregory Peck brings life to Herman Melville's crazed and vengeful seaman, earning his title among men as supreme lord and dictator. He will also earn his place at the end of the story, as head piece on the big marble tombstone known as Moby Dick.Aside from the action and adventure, what I found most enthralling about the film was the rhythmic and romantic chanting of the sailors, especially at the outset as they prepare to go to sea. Their confidence belies the look of dread and concern on the faces of family and sweethearts, as if their fate could be known in advance. For one crew member, that may be the case, as Ishmael (Richard Basehart) carries with him the prophecy of the mysterious Elijah (Royal Dano).I know it wasn't my imagination because I went back and checked. The facial scarring of Queequeg (Friedrich Ledebur) never looked quite the same from scene to scene. Generally they were of a simple pattern, but one scene in particular on the open ocean offered a symmetrical set of circular whorls over Queequeg's brow. Perhaps it was Ray Bradbury's way of intimating a bit of The Illustrated Man into the character, I wonder.Here's one thing I can tell you. Watching those flimsy boats in pursuit of whales, even forgetting about the great white, I can't imagine a more horrific way to earn a living. Personally, I've never been on a roller-coaster in my life, but given the choice against being dragged around the ocean by an enraged animal of dubious tonnage, I'll take my chances at an amusement park.

Ahab successfully bends the will of his crew to follow him into the mouth of hell, including lone hold out Starbuck (Leo Genn) by the time the whale claims his final victory.

Kubrick's signature tracking shots and creative use of colour and imagery make for many memorable scenes. Lots of symbolism is employed, such as the sexually charged paintings, and of course the wide assortment of masks and costumes. The soundtrack is also perfectly suited to the atmosphere of each scene. The use of a slow but rising piano beat is particularly effective at conveying the mystery and uncertainty that Tom's Cruise's character finds himself in and I found myself replaying it in my head for a long time after my first viewing.Now for the not so good.My biggest gripe with EWS is its often painfully slow pacing. Like 2001 A Space Odyssey, EWS has very little actual dialogue, instead relying largely on imagery to guide you through the journey. The problem is that what dialogue there is is not very interesting or relevant. Why does Tom Cruise's character have to repeat every bloody thing that others tell him? This combined with the at times agonizingly slow delivery of the lines frustrated the **** out of me. I can understand what Kubrick was going for (a dreamlike surreal atmosphere) but he fails to sell it clearly and convincingly enough, and the end result is tediousness rather than suspense.Honestly this is a real love hate relationship for me. EWS does grow on you a bit with repeated viewings; still a lot of people will likely be turned off by the pacing. The film is still better than a lot of what's out there, and is definitely worth a look for fans of Kubrick's other work. Overall though, I felt it was one of his weaker efforts.

I always felt it was a really poorly made movie, but perhaps that is because I watched it on cable. I plan to get a DVD of this movie to really take an honest look at at, but more importantly to just have a good time watching it. I liked the plot and the idea of the movie and I especially liked the cast. I always wonder if the cast enjoyed making the movies they are in and this is no exception. This film deserved a better fate than it received and Kelsey Grammar deserved at least one love scene with Ms. Holly. Who wouldn't?

I chose 2001. In contrast to the sci-fi genre of our time, 2001 isn't a typical sci fi movie with nonstop violence, and gore and offensive language. In my opinion, it actually laid the foundations of movies like Blade Runner and Star Wars. It actually is a whole different experience to watch this movie. The overall film has a lulling effect to it. Starting from the beginning of the scenes in space where Kubrick uses 'The Blue Danube' as the score for that portion of the movie. Personally, when I watched it, my whole body just relaxed. There is no clear tension in the beginning of the movie. The tension clearly jumps out though when HAL kills Poole. The other unnerving thing I found was the voice of HAL as he responded to questions. His voice is so artificial, yet to cunning and calculating. What really astounded me was that he was watching the astronauts' lips as they plotted to shut him down in the sound proof space pod. He read their lips and clearly and knew what they were plotting to do. The sound is also very cleverly used in the movie. The cut between the silent of space when you can hear absolutely nothing, to the cuts inside the spacecraft that's filled with whirls and blips of the computer is absolutely amazing. 2001 is a work of art. Quite unlike, anything I have ever seen before. Requires a bit of patience to watch...but when you watch the whole thing you feel fantastic. I actually came out feeling humbled after watching this movie.
