It is the second widely acclaimed film released--not counting musicals, of course--where the score is as important as the actors, cinematic photography, characters or the story (2001 A Space Odyssey is the first). Set in the West of its historical time period (Hawkeye's isolationist view was that his dad, his bro and he were heading to kan-tucky to escape the encroaching modern civilization since you couldn't get any bare bones farther west than that in the human knowledge of the day), this is the first real chase story in literature and Mann makes it so on screen, it starts with them running and finishes with them running; everyone is pursuing something, and few reach their destination without death and violence interrupting their personal chase. The photography belongs in a museum, the music is a symphonic magnet, the acting and sparsely spoken words fit like little pieces of a jigsaw puzzle to create an immaculately magnificent picture. This is right up there with Kubrich's Barry Lyndon as the best film ever photographed for popular release. A solid -10- Must See ...if you watch this, Dances With Wolves, then The Unforgiven and The Wild Bunch, you will have seen a staggering panoramic view of western genre that covers the entire period. As a trivial sidelight, Russell Means(as Chingachkook), who is a true American Indian, and was at the last battle with FBI and government agents at Wounded Knee, once was hired in Ohio during the Bicentennial Celebration, along with Native American buddies of his, to play Indians greeting the Mayflower crew as they landed. As the ship drew close they shot arrows at the landing party and refused to let them ashore (now THAT'S a true revolutionary with the courage and the intelligence to make a point with some great humor--although the folks that hired him in Cleveland weren't laughing much then) so its only appropriate that the moving and eloquent closing speech along the North Carolina skyline at sunset is his.

Put me in the camp of those who feel the added digital effects are a desecration; I want to see the movies the way they were released originally. I simply tried to ignore the alterations and was successful for the most part. It certainly is nice to see these films in widescreen, with outstanding picture and sound quality.I felt the same way after seeing Star Wars again that I have since 1977 it is the greatest achievement in the history of movies. To my surprise, however, when I watched Empire the next night, I was disappointed. It is a very well-directed, well-polished movie, but to my mind, it lacks the visual, graphic brilliance that helped make the original so extraordinary. Star Wars and American Graffiti, the two masterpieces George Lucas directed in his youth, both have an incredible, unmatched look. Lucas didn't move the camera much, but he made up for it with the amazing, jukebox-like style of what he photographed with it. Empire lacks that quality.***SPOIILERS AHEAD*** Star Wars was really a perfect story that ended with what is still the greatest action sequence ever (the Death Star battle) followed by the ultimate coda (the Throne Room scene). Watching Empire right afterward was a little jarring. Suddenly, without warning, we learn that despite destroying the ultimate power in the universe, the rebels have gained no advantage, and they're on the run, stuck hiding on a miserable little ice planet with a single, tiny base. Wouldn't more fighters, more systems have joined the Alliance after the destruction of the Death Star? How did the rebels go from ultimate victory to being nearly crushed so quickly?Another major shock to me -- and probably the biggest weakness of Empire -- was the change in the relationships of the three main characters. In Star Wars, from the moment Luke first saw Leia, he was in love with her (who is she? she's beautiful) -- so much so that he stood dumbstruck when he first entered her cell on the Death Star. There were strong hints that Leia reciprocated -- she kissed him (half on the cheek, half on the lips) twice, looked very nervous when he seemed dead in the final battle, and certainly Luke was in puppy-love with her the entire film. Now, all of a sudden, in Empire, Luke and Leia are on-screen together for about three minutes total, and there is no hint of Luke's love for her. Without explanation, now it's all about Han and Leia, who despite no hint of attraction in Star Wars are suddenly are madly in love. I suspect there are three main reasons for this1. Unlike Fisher and Hamill, Harrison Ford was not signed up for sequels. He only agreed to come back on condition that his character was developed from the wisecracking, cynical sidekick into the wisecracking, cynical, romantic hero lead. This gave his career a great boost, but in my opinion totally undercut the character of Luke Skywalker, who should have been the emotional focus of the movie (as he was in Star Wars).2. Mark Hamill's disfiguring car accident in December 1976 (after completion of principal photography on Star Wars) made it easier to turn his character into a monk-like, asexual person (the process that started in Empire and finished in Jedi). In Star Wars Hamill was a handsome, though callow, screen presence. But after the accident (despite plastic surgery), he just didn't look good. It hampered his performance and basically destroyed his capacity to play a romantic lead.3. To the extent that Lucas planned to have Leia be Luke's sister (a terrible decision that I suspect was not made until after the release of Empire), they obviously could not be romantically involved. However, their incestuous love for each other is all over Star Wars. I think the decision to make Leia and Luke siblings only came after the radical character revisions in Empire eliminated any romantic feelings between Luke and Leia and turned Luke into a boring monk.Indeed, Empire's greatest weakness is that it's too heavy. The dark side of the force was only briefly discussed in Star Wars, but here it's played up to an extent that the concept just can't support. Yoda says that fear, anger, hatred lead to the dark side, but how exactly is a human being supposed to avoid these emotions? The Force was fleshed out just the right amount (i.e., not too much) in Star Wars, but here it is revealed not to make a whole lot of sense. There's way too much good vs. evil that's no longer presented in a fun style in Empire. It's taken too seriously, which reminds me of the Lord of the Rings movies -- not a good thing.

","genre":"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"},{"date":"1 December 2004","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" A group of camp counsellors help fix up a crumbling summer camp in order to get it ready to re-open for the summer, despite warnings from town locals who seem to freeze up whenever the name of the camp is mentioned & warn the kids that the ground is cursed. Not that any of this is surprising for them to believe, since the camps history includes the drowning of a young boy in 1957, the brutal murders of a couple of amorous counsellors the summer after that, by an assailant that was never caught, various fires & poisoned water. Despite all this, the kids refuse to be deterred in their attempts & laugh at such things. However as night falls, so do they, all at the hands of a well armed maniac that is determined to kill them all. Friday The 13th is perhaps one of the most influential horror films ever made! Just picture a cross between MEATBALLS, PSYCHO & HALLOWEEN & you pretty much have the entire premise for this still brutal horror outing. The film has many gory set pieces that although not as shocking today, given the advancement of special effects techniques, still has the power to shock, such as seeing a young KEVIN BACON (In one of his first roles following a brief stint in ANIMAL HOUSE) having an arrow shoved through his throat, an axe to the face, a nasty slit throat, a vicious beheading, numerous stabbings & BING CROSBY'S son HARRY murdered in the style of ST. SEBASTIAN himself, by being pinned to a cabin door full of arrows! The direction by SEAN S. CUNNINGHAM is well executed. Cunningham knows how to milk out the suspense sequences & indeed Friday The 13th is full of them, as we nervously keep to the edge of out seats following the main characters in scenes where we know they are going to get killed, but not when or how & I feel this is what has allowed Friday The 13th to remain one of the most suspenseful & highly influential horror films of our time & why it continues to be popular today. Despite the gory kills, Cunningham never dwells on the murders in tight closeup, not does he linger on the shots like many of todays film-makers would, instead he shows just enough which along with the buildup to the suspense & scare sequences makes you think you've seen an incredible amount of violence & gore when in truth you really haven't seen that much. In fact, very few of the murders are shown on screen, with the majority of them shown after the fact & I also feel this is what helped make Friday The 13th so special, it also allows the audience to use their heads, imagining what might have happened to that victim. Texas Chainsaw Massacre also used this approach & it worked very well too.TOM SAVINI'S make-up effects are top notch & brutal. Plus the cinematography is good & eerie as BARRY ABRAMS is able to capture the right amount of atmosphere to give the film a stark, almost documentary like feel, which really helps, especially in scenes where we see the maniacs blend in with the dark shadows of the eerie looking summer camp. That said, there problems with the the film, including an odd ball scene where the town crazy hides in the pantry for no reason only to come out & scare three of the counsellors, offering them stern warnings about the camps evil, before departing & a lot of the acting minus KEVIN BACON, BETSY PALMER & HARRY CROSBY is wooden & the dialogue can get a little clunky at times. The film also touches upon a possible love story between the lead heroine Alice & the camps owner Steve Christy, not to mention between Alice & the character of Bill (Crosby) but none of this is ever touched upon & the film tends to slow down with a ridiculous strip monopoly game that goes nowhere later on in the evening as the body count begins, since none of the actor ever get naked.

Not that any of this is surprising for them to believe, since the camps history includes the drowning of a young boy in 1957, the brutal murders of a couple of amorous counsellors the summer after that, by an assailant that was never caught, various fires & poisoned water. Despite all this, the kids refuse to be deterred in their attempts & laugh at such things. However as night falls, so do they, all at the hands of a well armed maniac that is determined to kill them all. Friday The 13th is perhaps one of the most influential horror films ever made! Just picture a cross between MEATBALLS, PSYCHO & HALLOWEEN & you pretty much have the entire premise for this still brutal horror outing. The film has many gory set pieces that although not as shocking today, given the advancement of special effects techniques, still has the power to shock, such as seeing a young KEVIN BACON (In one of his first roles following a brief stint in ANIMAL HOUSE) having an arrow shoved through his throat, an axe to the face, a nasty slit throat, a vicious beheading, numerous stabbings & BING CROSBY'S son HARRY murdered in the style of ST. SEBASTIAN himself, by being pinned to a cabin door full of arrows! The direction by SEAN S. CUNNINGHAM is well executed. Cunningham knows how to milk out the suspense sequences & indeed Friday The 13th is full of them, as we nervously keep to the edge of out seats following the main characters in scenes where we know they are going to get killed, but not when or how & I feel this is what has allowed Friday The 13th to remain one of the most suspenseful & highly influential horror films of our time & why it continues to be popular today. Despite the gory kills, Cunningham never dwells on the murders in tight closeup, not does he linger on the shots like many of todays film-makers would, instead he shows just enough which along with the buildup to the suspense & scare sequences makes you think you've seen an incredible amount of violence & gore when in truth you really haven't seen that much. In fact, very few of the murders are shown on screen, with the majority of them shown after the fact & I also feel this is what helped make Friday The 13th so special, it also allows the audience to use their heads, imagining what might have happened to that victim. Texas Chainsaw Massacre also used this approach & it worked very well too.TOM SAVINI'S make-up effects are top notch & brutal. Plus the cinematography is good & eerie as BARRY ABRAMS is able to capture the right amount of atmosphere to give the film a stark, almost documentary like feel, which really helps, especially in scenes where we see the maniacs blend in with the dark shadows of the eerie looking summer camp. That said, there problems with the the film, including an odd ball scene where the town crazy hides in the pantry for no reason only to come out & scare three of the counsellors, offering them stern warnings about the camps evil, before departing & a lot of the acting minus KEVIN BACON, BETSY PALMER & HARRY CROSBY is wooden & the dialogue can get a little clunky at times. The film also touches upon a possible love story between the lead heroine Alice & the camps owner Steve Christy, not to mention between Alice & the character of Bill (Crosby) but none of this is ever touched upon & the film tends to slow down with a ridiculous strip monopoly game that goes nowhere later on in the evening as the body count begins, since none of the actor ever get naked.

But the movie is so well made that it is able to remain effective despite its questionable premise, kind of like Darkman, another movie with something of a goofy plot but that still manages to come off as a great action horror film.Some of the best moments in the film come early on, before anyone but Andy realizes that Chucky is alive. Kind of like what Steven Spielberg did in Jaws, director Tom Holland leaves Chucky as a lifeless doll for a good portion of the beginning of the film. As is to be expected, it's much more difficult to show a living, running, stabbing, screaming doll than it is to show a regular doll, which itself manages to stare blankly in such a way that you know there's something going on in its head.There's nothing worse than hearing someone criticize the acting skills of a little kid, but I have to admit that I found Alex Vincent's performance as Andy a little trying at times. Granted, the kid deserves a lot of credit for performing reasonably well in a horror film at the age of 7, which is certainly more than I could have done at that age, but for every time that he effectively portrayed a scared little kid, which happened often, there were at least as many times when he spoke with the wooden monotone generally associated with reading a cue card.That being said, the effects in the movie are very impressive. There are a few goofs in there, but you have to look pretty hard to find them, and the doll itself was very well done. Brad Dourif makes one of his earlier appearances, showing up in Child's Play just long enough to get shot and then transfer his body into the doll, and then spend the rest of what is now a total of five movies trying to get out of it, which may have something to do with the fact that his voice is more famous than his face. He was mostly known as the timid Billy Bibbit from One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest before he did Child's Play, and the success of this movie clearly had a significant impact on the rest of his career, since so many of his later performances were in decidedly dark roles.Note watch for the only funny scene in the movie, which my itself is so funny that any other comic relief isn't even necessary. As Chucky ascends in an elevator, and elderly woman notices him, but her husband tells her to just leave it, whoever forgot it is bound to come back for it. When she exits the elevator, she looks back with a grimace and says, 'Ugly doll&#133;' Chucky's response is one of the funniest things I've ever seen in a horror film.

An absolutely brilliant display of psychological horror. Alan Parker made the scariest film of the eighties, maybe the scariest film of the second half of the century with this picture. The hell with Psycho, Angel Heart is where it's at if you want horror.I don't know how Parker hasn't become the Hitchcock of his generation after this film. I know some of his other work - Evita and Mississippi Burning are two films of his that I happen to think are pretty good. But they're nothing like this. What Parker does so well here, what he seems to get better than any other director I've noticed since this film was made, is how atmosphere makes a movie. He has a real sense of place and time that's a key component to making the terror of this movie real.Aside from Parker's talents, there are three performances without which the movie just wouldn't work.Robert de Niro gives the second best performance of his career here, right next to Raging Bull, and even that's pretty close. I'm not even normally a huge fan of de Niro's - I mean, don't get me wrong, he's a legend, but I find most of the time that I'm less impressed with him than most people are. Not here. In this movie, de Niro makes the simple act of eating an egg into a treatise on mortal dread. He should have received the Oscar for this performance, no question about it.Lisa Bonet - what happened to her? Every couple of years I'll see her in something like this or High Fidelity, and she's got all this charisma - she really is a superb actress. What she does here is really interesting because you can see that it's very underdone, a lot of subtlety. Which is a strange way to go if you're playing a voodoo priestess. But she's very vulnerable here. I think it's a shame she didn't become the star she could have. I'd love to see more work from her.Mickey Rourke is another resident of the Where are they now? file. I've heard more from him recently though. He's been making a comeback of sorts. He's actually the primary reason I rented this movie, because I saw him in Sean Penn's The Pledge and wanted to see more of his stuff. He's the third performance that makes this movie complete, and he's the one who really has the hardest job, who has to strap it to his back and get it across the finish line. His is also the most important job, because he needs to instill the terror in you. It's through his eyes that you witness these bizarre events, and it's his reaction that makes it all the more terrifying.Again, brilliant. Can't say enough about it. The last thirty seconds or so kind of sucks (those of you who've seen it know what I'm referring to), but I can just turn it off before that. Oddly, it doesn't ruin what's come before.

He's actually the primary reason I rented this movie, because I saw him in Sean Penn's The Pledge and wanted to see more of his stuff. He's the third performance that makes this movie complete, and he's the one who really has the hardest job, who has to strap it to his back and get it across the finish line. His is also the most important job, because he needs to instill the terror in you. It's through his eyes that you witness these bizarre events, and it's his reaction that makes it all the more terrifying.Again, brilliant. Can't say enough about it. The last thirty seconds or so kind of sucks (those of you who've seen it know what I'm referring to), but I can just turn it off before that. Oddly, it doesn't ruin what's come before.

An absolutely brilliant display of psychological horror. Alan Parker made the scariest film of the eighties, maybe the scariest film of the second half of the century with this picture. The hell with Psycho, Angel Heart is where it's at if you want horror.I don't know how Parker hasn't become the Hitchcock of his generation after this film. I know some of his other work - Evita and Mississippi Burning are two films of his that I happen to think are pretty good. But they're nothing like this. What Parker does so well here, what he seems to get better than any other director I've noticed since this film was made, is how atmosphere makes a movie. He has a real sense of place and time that's a key component to making the terror of this movie real.Aside from Parker's talents, there are three performances without which the movie just wouldn't work.Robert de Niro gives the second best performance of his career here, right next to Raging Bull, and even that's pretty close. I'm not even normally a huge fan of de Niro's - I mean, don't get me wrong, he's a legend, but I find most of the time that I'm less impressed with him than most people are. Not here. In this movie, de Niro makes the simple act of eating an egg into a treatise on mortal dread. He should have received the Oscar for this performance, no question about it.Lisa Bonet - what happened to her? Every couple of years I'll see her in something like this or High Fidelity, and she's got all this charisma - she really is a superb actress.

Let's start with the chronology; originally The Mummy starring Boris Karloff was set in 1932, the year of it's release, reinforced by the second expedition to Egypt by the Whemple's at which time they discovered the tomb of Anck-Es-En-Amon, Imhoteps' lost love of 3700 years prior. The first sequel, The Mummy's Hand is also chronologically coherent, set in 1940. But then it gets interesting; The Mummy's Tomb takes place some thirty years following the events of Hand, with The Mummy's Ghost somewhat after. Now we learn that The Mummy's Curse occurs an additional twenty five years after Ghost. If you're doing the math, we're now into 1995!Now we're into the locale; Ghost ended with Kharis and Ananka lost in a Massachusetts swamp, Ananka's beauty having withered into an ages old hag before the waters of the swamp claimed the two lovebirds. Now we've shifted to the Louisiana bayou country and the site of an industrial project - The devil's on the loose and he's dancin' with the mummy! We're signaled to the emergence of the Kharis legend by the first appearance of a dead body, but has anyone noticed that the laborer Antoine died with a knife in his back? Kharis always did his dirty work with his left hand, leaving bandage mold behind on the neck of his victims.I must say though, the resurrection of Princess Ananka was inspired and a classic piece of work, as she slowly and gradually crawls out of the dirt of the swamp, her twenty five year old mud pack having worked wonders for her complexion - and all without benefit of a tana leaf brew! Speaking of which, the tana leaf legacy gets a slight reworking in this film as well, it takes three leaves to keep Kharis' heart beating and nine to give him life and movement.As Ananka, Virginia Christine is a quick study, note that in all the Mummy films, none of the victims ever figured it out like Ananka - RUN AWAY FROM THE MONSTER! Hey, how great would it have been though, when Dr. Halsey (Dennis Moore) and Betty Walsh (Kay Harding), discover the collapsed Ananka on the side of a swamp road(?) and the creature not far behind in pursuit, if The Mummy had actually overcome the scientist, picked up Ananka and drove away in the car? It would not have been any zanier than the actual outcome.Finally, is it possible that Egyptian high priests just have no self discipline? George Zucco's Andoheb, Turhan Bey's Mehemet, John Carradine's Yousef, and now Martin Kosleck's Ragheb falls under the spell of a pretty woman, all breaking their vows to deliver Kharis and Ananka to their final resting place.Eventually, Lon Chaney's Kharis creates his own undoing, destroying the monastery where Ananka's sarcophagus is held, with the rubble of the building crashing down on top of him. But it was with a sense of It's not too late to do this at least one more time that I viewed the ending, Kharis has gotten out of a lot tougher scrapes than this one.If you can't tell by now, my sarcasm for the Mummy series is done tongue in cheek, because the films are a blast and a sheer joy for lovers of old classic horror. While the original Mummy deserves it's place in the Universal pantheon of terrific characters along with Frankenstein, Dracula, and the Wolfman, the sequel Mummy's are best enjoyed on a somewhat different level, one that requires a stronger disengagement from reality and definitely allowing a chuckle or two.

Simon Templar is more than just a saint, he's a chameleon in the process.Elisabeth Shue, is great, I remembered her from The Karate Kid and Leaving Las Vegas, did very well playing Emma, she looked great throughout the movie. I liked the part when that Russian hooker helped Simon and Emma from the Russian Mafia led by Ivan Tretiak. Once his own countrymen found out who he really was, the people turned on him big time.

Wells science fiction classic works very well. It has a number of strengths, but it benefits most of all from James Whale's direction, creativity, and technical excellence. Both the flashier aspects of the movie (such as the invisibility effects) and also most of the basic elements are done with skill.The story is for the most part based on the one main idea of The Invisible Man who combines his scientific genius with a generous supply of madness. The story is interesting enough in itself, and of course it provides all kinds of opportunities for visual tricks. Whale hits just the right balance in making good use of these opportunities without over-indulging himself.The visual effects themselves are of excellent quality, and they are far better than all but the very best of the present-day computer imagery. While it is usually rather easy to spot which parts of a movie are computer-generated, Whale's effects are all but seamless, with the exception of a handful of brief moments. They are often quite impressive, without resorting to tired devices, such as explosions and the like, in order to impress those with shorter attention spans.Claude Rains does quite well for having such limitations on what he could do. The rest of the cast is solid, if mostly unspectacular, letting the story do the work. Una O'Connor somewhat overdoes it with the screaming this time, but otherwise the characters are believable. The acting may seem slightly quaint to those who are accustomed to the pretentious styles of the present generation of performers, but it's certainly better than the grating, self-important performances in some of the recent movies of the same genre.While the story does not have the thematic depth or the suggestive imagery of horror classics like Frankenstein or Dracula, this adaptation gets everything it can out of the material, telling the story in an entertaining fashion and with technical skill.

One thing you can virtually always guarantee from a De Palma movie is flamboyance, and this is no exception. Not content with a compelling story, the director has thrown in a series of his typically bravura set pieces, the best of which is a truly outstanding railway station shootout. Treasury agent Eliot Ness (Kevin Costner) is working in Prohibition-era Chicago when he realises that a fair bit of crime, particularly bootlegging, is going unnoticed. Most of the city cops either haven't realized it's happening or have chosen to turn a blind eye. Ness soon learns that the criminal underworld is controlled by ruthless gangster Al Capone (Robert De Niro), who men on both sides of the law fear to tackle. Aided by a trusty band of three loyal pals, Irish cop Malone (Sean Connery), suave George Stone (Andy Garcia), and reliable Oscar Wallace (C.M Smith), Ness wages war on Capone and his gangland cronies. While other law enforcers pretend nothing is going on, Ness and his men swoop into action against the smugglers, bootleggers, and gunmen terrorising the city streets. Capone is not pleased - he turns his attention to stamping out these troublesome law enforcers who have put a dent in his lucrative criminal empire.Unsurprisingly, the acting here is high-class. Costner does what's required as Ness, but Connery and De Niro go a few steps further. Connery's experienced Irish cop is a wonderful role (indeed, the role which deservedly won the big Scot his only Oscar), while De Niro demonstrates how to portray evilness as only he can (his baseball bat slaying of an associate is shocking and disturbing in the extreme). Also memorable is Billy Drago as Capone's most psychopathic henchman Frank Nitti (not only does he get some powerful scenes; he also dies the most extraordinary death in the whole film). De Palma provides numerous flashy sequences, including a smuggling raid on the US-Canadian border, the rooftop skirmish between Ness and Nitti, and the afore-mentioned railway sequence. Ennio Morricone's music score is exciting and well-suited to the events on screen. There are occasional misjudgements, like Connery's ludicrously prolonged slaying (any more bullets and he's be a walking hunk of lead) and some slushy family interludes with Ness which are intended to show his loving, caring side but which only interfere with the proceedings. On the whole, though, The Untouchables is a fine movie which probably represents De Palma's best work of the '80s.
