Then I have to specify that I mean the Tyrone Power movie, not the Fairbanks one and certainly not the Banderas. Ah, elitism can be amusing sometimes...Seriously, though, this is one heck of a motion picture. The best part is the pacing; it's deliciously slow, in the most effective way. Characters are developed fully, tensions heighten gradually, and just when you're on the verge of getting bored - BOOM! A fantastic chase scene or swordfight perfectly repays your patience. Well, my patience, anyway. Maybe you were bored the whole way through? Tyrone Power is simply awesome in this flick. He's hilarious as the fey Don Diego, and he cuts an impressive figure as Zorro. It's easy to see that Batman was patterned on Zorro, as he also pretends to be a stupid playboy, but Bruce Wayne was *never* this cool.Basil Rathbone makes a great villain, as always, and his close-quarters duel with Zorro is, as I'm sure you've heard, one of cinema's great action scenes (I think the confined setting actually enhances the suspense). Even J. Edward Bromberg, who plays a slightly dated and silly character, somehow manages to come across well - it's interesting to see his character come into his own as the main villain at the end of the movie.Even the romance isn't a dud. Lots of amusing flirting goes on, and Linda Darnell certainly is easy on the eyes. Why can't they make action flicks like this anymore? To paraphrase a certain famous political catchphrase, it's the characters, stupid. Everybody in this movie is colorful and cool, and through them I get wrapped up in the plot.

And today, after who knows how many times I've skipped it(which I thank myself for, even more so now), I decided to give it a shot... you know why? I found out Neve Campbell was in it. Of course, that's not the only reason... Campbell's hot, and a good actress, but she's not good enough to outweigh Perry's aggravatingly stupid presence. No, what really did it was that I found out that John C. McGinley had a role in it. Believe me, as long as he's in it, I'll watch almost anything.

I'm not exaggerating, I'd watch Scrubs if it was just half a minute of McGinley giving one of his speeches directly at the camera, once a week. I love his character. Since I know he often plays that same type of character(The Animal, On Deadly Ground and The Rock), I hoped that he would have a big role in this, and that he'd make the movie tolerable. Unfortunately, it was not to be. His entire screen-time amounts to about five minutes in total, and the film is even more horrible that I could have imagined. The plot is one of the most ridiculous and unoriginal that I've ever heard. The pacing is so bad that it seems like the director expects the audience through anything.

","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"9 October 2004","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":"  'Warlock' is one of the more impressive and entertaining entries in the witch characters of horror films.**SPOILERS**In 1691, a tiny village near Boston, Massachusetts forces a young man to confess of being a witch. He manages to escape from being hanged by a mysterious cloud, along with a man with the church, Redferne (Richard Grant) tracks him to the year 1991. There, the witch's (Julian Sands) entrance scares a young woman, Kassandra (Lori Singer) and her husband Chas, (Kevin O'Brien) who take in the unconscious man and nurse him back to health. After killing Chas, the Warlock escapes and learns of his reason for being in this particular area of time. Kassandra returns home after learning about Chas and finds Redferne in her home. After his desperate plea to Kassandra for help in finding the Warlock, she doesn't believe him, even after meeting the Warlock face to face. Realizing she needs Redferne's help and protection, she springs him from jail and try to find the Warlock before he reunites the pages of a book that will unleash the Devil from hell.The Good News It may take awhile for the plot to get going, but when it does, it does not disappoint. The race against time to stop the Warlock before Kassandra ages to death adds some much needed suspense to the film. As there aren't much in the way of jumps or shocks, the underlying suspense of weather or not they could stop him in time boosted the film up a tad. The gore in the film was pretty well-handled, as their wasn't many deaths in the film, but those that are here are pretty convincing. It does need to be stated that this isn't a body count film in any way, as the Warlock isn't the killing machine he could've been, such as those in other similar movies. That in itself was a refreshing part of the movie, but the most refreshing part is its smartness. The film has a great way of creating a world mixing violence, religious undertones, and a form of black comedy into a very entertaining mixture. It makes you think about what is going on, but it's fault lies in the fact that it never truly goes inside your head like great thrillers, but it does make you think a little more than the average horror film.The Bad News While not as blatantly religious as a film like 'End of days,' this film does posses a strong religious undertone that some may not gravitate to. I don not wish to spark debate, but I don't care if a film is religious or not, as long as a film entertains me. I simply wanted to post that. The main weak link in this film is that it misses a great opportunity to have a bit of humor in having Redferne be out-of-touch in modern society. By having him have difficulty in operating gadgets of the 20th century would've been a great comedic device they could've used. Also, Redferne's entrance into our world is never explained. I know it was important to get the plot further, but I don't know how he got into this world.

He manages to escape from being hanged by a mysterious cloud, along with a man with the church, Redferne (Richard Grant) tracks him to the year 1991. There, the witch's (Julian Sands) entrance scares a young woman, Kassandra (Lori Singer) and her husband Chas, (Kevin O'Brien) who take in the unconscious man and nurse him back to health. After killing Chas, the Warlock escapes and learns of his reason for being in this particular area of time. Kassandra returns home after learning about Chas and finds Redferne in her home. After his desperate plea to Kassandra for help in finding the Warlock, she doesn't believe him, even after meeting the Warlock face to face. Realizing she needs Redferne's help and protection, she springs him from jail and try to find the Warlock before he reunites the pages of a book that will unleash the Devil from hell.The Good News It may take awhile for the plot to get going, but when it does, it does not disappoint. The race against time to stop the Warlock before Kassandra ages to death adds some much needed suspense to the film. As there aren't much in the way of jumps or shocks, the underlying suspense of weather or not they could stop him in time boosted the film up a tad. The gore in the film was pretty well-handled, as their wasn't many deaths in the film, but those that are here are pretty convincing. It does need to be stated that this isn't a body count film in any way, as the Warlock isn't the killing machine he could've been, such as those in other similar movies. That in itself was a refreshing part of the movie, but the most refreshing part is its smartness. The film has a great way of creating a world mixing violence, religious undertones, and a form of black comedy into a very entertaining mixture. It makes you think about what is going on, but it's fault lies in the fact that it never truly goes inside your head like great thrillers, but it does make you think a little more than the average horror film.The Bad News While not as blatantly religious as a film like 'End of days,' this film does posses a strong religious undertone that some may not gravitate to. I don not wish to spark debate, but I don't care if a film is religious or not, as long as a film entertains me. I simply wanted to post that. The main weak link in this film is that it misses a great opportunity to have a bit of humor in having Redferne be out-of-touch in modern society. By having him have difficulty in operating gadgets of the 20th century would've been a great comedic device they could've used. Also, Redferne's entrance into our world is never explained. I know it was important to get the plot further, but I don't know how he got into this world.

A cool concept, more plausible in many respects than Toy Story (which I also enjoyed, don't get me wrong), and some very cool designs and special effects, not ALL of which were computer-generated, unlike most of today's movies.I visited Universal Studious Hollywood around the time they were promoting this movie. They had costumed characters walking around dressed as the Gorgonites and the Commandos (the Commandos were getting a lot more attention), and they had a soundstage with most of the toys used in the movie on display. This was VERY cool to see. The characters were amazing, and some of the Commando vehicles were huge!I wish there would be a sequel. I know one has been considered from time to time. I think the next time around, though, the Commandos need to be more heroic. They were certainly more popular than the Gorgonites. In fact, I wrote a fanfic story (never posted it anywhere) where the Gorgonites and the Commandos have to team up to defeat a third, more dangerous threat -- large toy dinosaurs. (Stan Winston, who worked on both Small Soldiers and Jurassic Park, would probably love this...)Eerily, real toy technology seems to be catching up to the Small Soldiers. I've seen a new G.I.Joe toy that not only speaks, but it moves its mouth when it does (with a little user help). It also looks faintly like Chip Hazard. So maybe the movie-makers should consider doing a sequel to this cool movie before the technology becomes old news!

Of course the plot is far-fetched, of course there are some inconsistencies, and of course this isn't anything meaningful. But I think that teen horror movies have to be judged by the standards of the genre. And seen from this perspective, it does pretty well. First of all the production values are good, the editing careful (watch the title sequence with all the little cues), the overall design nicely thought out. Casting is o.k., even though Kerr Smith may seem a little out of place to fans of Dawson's Creek. There are enough graphic deaths to keep the more gore-oriented faction of fans reasonably satisfied, the love story (doesn't every teen horror flick need one) is nicely subdued, and most important - it is at no time apparent what is going to happen next. The end, which some people seem to have found confusing, actually makes a lot of sense and cleared up a nagging feeling of being cheated that I had during the last ten minutes or so, expecting a typical happy end. Instead it leaves the future of the two remaining survivors at stake - inviting the (probably rather cheap) sequel that movies of this genre need. All in all a wholly watchable effort.

However, I hadn't been aware that a teenage Adrien Brody was supposed to be in it until I happened to look up his credits on the IMDb. Since he was listed in order of appearance as part of the cast of Coppola's segment LIFE WITHOUT ZOË, I kept a sharp eye out for young Brody in the school cafeteria scene -- at least it *looked* like it was supposed to be the cafeteria! The artistically dim lighting made things a little hard to see, which may be why I (and other Brody fans I know) could hardly find Brody at all. Judging by the order in which he's listed in the credits (as a character named Mel), Brody should've shown up in Zoë's school right after the know-it-all character Andrea (Alexandra Becker) shows up, just before the Sherry-Netherland robbery scene with Chris Elliott. Brody must have had dialogue at some point, or he wouldn't have been in the credits at all. However, I guess Coppola & Company pulled a THIN RED LINE on the adolescent Adrien, because I didn't see or hear him utter a single syllable. My only inkling that Boy Brody was in the scene at all was that when I looked very closely and pressed my DVD remote's Slow button, I thought I detected a familiar noble-nosed profile amongst the students stylishly silhouetted in the background. Oh, well, at least Brody got an early screen credit and presumably a paycheck out of the experience, as did another future Oscar-winner Sofia Coppola, who co-wrote the script and designed the cute opening credit sequence. Nevertheless, I found LIFE WITHOUT ZOË entertaining even when the game of Spot the Adrien came a cropper, despite its reputation as the weakest of NYS's trio of vignettes. While it has its overly precious moments, it's basically an uncredited 'tween update of Kay Thompson's ELOISE AT THE PLAZA book series, one of my faves; think of this as ZOË AT THE SHERRY-NETHERLAND. With gorgeous New York locations, catchy songs by Kid Creole & the Coconuts, and a likable cast including young Heather McComb, Don Novello, Giancarlo Giannini, and Talia Shire, you could find worse ways to pass the time. As for the other entries, Scorsese's LIFE LESSONS, with a screenplay by Richard Price, is well-crafted and well-acted, though the temperamental, manipulative artist and assistant\/muse\/lover played, respectively, by Nick Nolte and Rosanna Arquette were so immature and strident they got on my nerves after a while. Hands down, my favorite of the 3 vignettes (and the fave of most folks who've seen NYS) was Allen's uproarious OEDIPUS WRECKS, the story of a Jewish mother (Mae Questel, the cutie who voiced Betty Boop and Olive Oyl, is a devious delight) whose well-meant domination of her henpecked son (Allen) gets out of hand when the audience participation portion of a magic show goes horribly yet hilariously awry. Mia Farrow and Julie Kavner provide able support; CURB YOUR ENTHUSIASM fans should keep an eye out for Larry David in a brief bit as the magic show theater manager.

As for the other entries, Scorsese's LIFE LESSONS, with a screenplay by Richard Price, is well-crafted and well-acted, though the temperamental, manipulative artist and assistant\/muse\/lover played, respectively, by Nick Nolte and Rosanna Arquette were so immature and strident they got on my nerves after a while. Hands down, my favorite of the 3 vignettes (and the fave of most folks who've seen NYS) was Allen's uproarious OEDIPUS WRECKS, the story of a Jewish mother (Mae Questel, the cutie who voiced Betty Boop and Olive Oyl, is a devious delight) whose well-meant domination of her henpecked son (Allen) gets out of hand when the audience participation portion of a magic show goes horribly yet hilariously awry. Mia Farrow and Julie Kavner provide able support; CURB YOUR ENTHUSIASM fans should keep an eye out for Larry David in a brief bit as the magic show theater manager. Kavner's home-cooked chicken drumstick gets my vote for Best Performance by an Inanimate Object! -)  ","genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance"},{"date":"9 October 2004","score":"7 out of 15 people found the following review useful","review":" There are spoilers of both the book and the movie. Read with caution.Everyone compares how well a movie adapts a book to the screen, and they may rightly complain if the adaptation didn't follow the book. My estimation of this movie is that while they only modestly follow the plot (The Message, The Machine, The Galaxy) and highlight only the key story points, the screenwriter and director actually captured the 'essence' of the book. So much that I'm certain that if Carl Sagan had been alive for the final edit, the 'For Carl' at the end of the film would have been welcomed by the author.The book is 431 pages of small font, extremely deep material. Yet Robert Zemeckis, Carl Sagan, Ann Druyan, James V. Hart, and Michael Goldenberg constructed a movie that tells a similar story that can be understood by all that spend the time to understand it. Regarding the book and movie differences. Did they change the number of people to travel in the machine? Yes. Did they change the political climate? Yes. Did they slightly demonize and trivialize Drummond, while making Ellie appear a little more sympathetic? Yes. Was Palmer Joss' role increased? Yes. Was the full journey described? No, but close.So what. My only real complaint is the 'pi' storyline omission, but they covered their bases with the final scene between Angela Bassett and James Woods (great character performances, by the way). I almost never see an adaptation of a book that lives up to the brilliance of the source material, but this one does. The effects supplement the story well, as opposed to dominating the screen.Robert Zemeckis has made two of my top ten movies, the other being Forrest Gump. Should I ever meet him, my only word would be...Thanks.
