When The Matrix was released on its time, thiz movie contributes many breakthrough methods for cinema world. The movie is directed by Larry and Andy Wachowski who was under radar all these times. They are only known as small budget film Directors in Bound (1996). Later, The Matrix has two more back-to-back sequels which are Matrix Reloaded and Matrix Revolution in 2003. You can almost classify the stars in thiz movie as B-Class Actors, if it's not because of Keanu Reeves, but still the outcome is beyond the expectations. Each of the characters like Neo (Keanu Reeves), Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne), Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) , even the villain Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) have already become a legendary icon in the industry. One of the strengths of thiz movie is the phenomenal action scenes. The fight scenes are something new and different, which is later followed by other movies. Behind that extraordinary fight scenes are experienced Martial Arts Choreographer Yuen Woo Ping. Woo Ping is the man behind Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (2000), Kill Bill (2003),The Forbidden Kingdom (2008) and even Jackie Chan's Kung Fu classic like Snake in the Eagle's Shadow (1978). His experiences in a lot of Asian movies made him effective. The movie definitely exceeds our imagination. As a matter of fact, many people do not understand entirely the story of The Matrix, there are still many blank spots to be answered. Eventually, the movie is filled with countless great philosophies inside. It seems like Wachowski Brothers have discovered how to make a brilliant concept for the story by fetching the philosophies from some religions. The essence is not that simple as it looks, actually we will always have something new every time we watch it over and over again. The Matrix is a smart movie and will always be one of my favorite movies of all-time!

The movie receives a lot of good reviews from most critics. You must see it yourself then you will understand why. Pulp Fiction is starred by many famous Actors such as John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thurman, Bruce Willis and many more. It's directed by Quentin Tarantino who is known for his eccentric works. The plot is unusual, but very intriguing in a strange way. The script made by Tarantino himself. It's kind of confusing in the beginning, but it becomes better and better as time goes by. It moves forward and backward along the movie with attractive flashback sequences. The thing that made thiz movie so special is simply those elements. You must see it over and over to understand the idea. However, actually the plot is just an ordinary plot, but the editing made it extremely extraordinary for overall. The other factor that make thiz movie unforgettable is the dialogue. The dialogue is mostly long but colorful, rude but exciting. Thiz movie is actually made with limited budget, but it's still loaded with many big stars. Thiz has proved that the Actors know for sure there is something very special in the script. The other memorable scene that you will never forget is when the dancing scene of John Travolta and Uma Truman. The dancing is phenomenal. Most people remember Travolta for his 1980s musical movies such as Saturday Night Fever (1977) and Grease (1978). Today, when we see him dancing again with his present figure, you can feel in that very moment, something magical is happening. That is the fun part. If you like indie movie, you certainly must go to see thiz one.Visit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE  http\/\/jonnyfendi.blogspot.com ","genre":null},{"date":"17 April 2010","score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" Thiz movie is known as the most talked about movie of the decade.

The most important roles in thiz movie are held by Edward Norton and Brad Pitt. Norton is the main character, who its name is not mentioned until the end of the movie. Pitt is Tyler Durden, the bad boy character. The other Cast members are Helena Bonham Carter and Meatloaf who is known better as a Musician. The plot is arranged well. We could see what actually happens from the beginning until the end from the innocent eyes of the narrator. The movie begins with a slow intro. In the beginning of the story, the main character is told as insomniac. But after a few incidents, he finds himself that he has some hallucination visions, in that time Tyler Durden appears. Afterward, both characters are roller-coasting all over the movie. Ever since, the story is getting excited. One of Durden's quotes is so powerful, The number one rule about Fight Club is you do not talk about Fight Club... The number two rule about Fight Club is&#x85;You do not talk about Fight Club!. Thiz character is simply one of the best Pitt's performances since Twelve Monkeys in 1995. The ending of thiz film could become the best twist ending of the decade.

I later found,like myself many people thought the music was great and the scenes were beautiful, but the movie had no point. I just watched it again for the second time and was amazed, my opinion has changed and I think this film is wonderful.It's one of those movies that is like a song with metaphors and nothing hinting at the truth and everything hinting at the speculation as to what it is about. Art and music, and in cases such as this film, it's for the viewer to walk away with what he needs to take from it.. you are not told how to feel, or told an explanation as to what you see, you just watch and feel whatever, and most people will have different views. The writer and\/or director were inspired by things and had their own visions as to what they were trying to show you and what they were trying to say, yet they made sure not to be blunt or factual about these truths and reasoning.This film starts with several minutes of silence and a black screen which to me symbolizes nothing..nothing is what we all came from, not a god but some unknown particles bonding to form something that became something else... The film does not show these evolutionary happenings, yet it goes into the dawn of man. The apes that we derived from - scared beings who must learn and grow. They must defend themselves from other creatures just like them, but different..enemies...competitors. I must say the monolith was what made the film first get truly interesting..I see that as symbolic of the things that we know nothing about, yet the thing we worship, desire and crave. The apes are intrigued and eventually like all things, the monolith becomes apparent and a steak in reality. The beasts..us.. eventually learn to kill and life gets better, life gets worse, life gets going. Man's true nature is to kill, protect and survive.The movie goes straight from the dawn of man to space. To me this symbolizes many things, one we all know what happened so why retell it, also the past straight into the future says that once man learned to kill and hate and survive thats all we have basically done for centuries...Love and hate, life and death, faith and free will all go hand in hand and space is our way of trying to search for life in other places, perhaps to learn, but definitely to conquer, it is mans way of needing more, needing answers. Space is the one thing untouched by man and it was indeed a final frontier waiting to be discovered.We see inside a space craft and the civilized world it seemed to have. The truths of how it would be, the call for your Christian name, the lobbies with Howard Johnsons promotions and big business getting its greedy paws in a space-station if there were ones...very subtle truths.The spaceship is ran by a super-computer called the HAL-900 which for a movie in 1968 foretold a greater truth that the world relies too much on machines, they place their life in this computer. It's a great factor and a major plot to this film.They find another monolith on the moon, it's the unknown. It's basic squealing which deafens those who arrive at its presence is an obvious way of it telling people to leave it alone, yet they go to Jupiter to see a larger version of it. This is when Hal sees problems with the bigger picture and the mutiny planned to disable him and he seeks revenge.David Bowman disconnects HAL and heads on alone through the an atmosphere of vivid colors, we see him as an old man, looking at himself as an older man. Perhaps trying to say what is the point in life. Seeing yourself about to die, seeing yourself dying, see yourself older than you are and the emptiness you have when being alone. You live life knowing it will come to an end.The monolith symbolizes the things we search for our entire life, until our last breath we will question so many things, god, meaning of life, where our soul goes. The monolith represents that which we can never find.The movie ends with a baby, the forming of a baby and it looks like David Bowman. The true end, is perhaps the new beginning, Maybe our soul takes form in where we go and we start over somewhere else as a baby. Maybe we are reincarnated and take over life here as what will become someone else. Or perhaps neither, perhaps the new baby was symbolic of something completely different, someone completely new.. Either way it says that whatever we ponder, what ever mysteries we have we leave them in the end for someone else to start over and do it all again.This movie was beautiful, direction was great and these shots were breathtaking. The music was perfection and has became iconic, the actors did well and this movie is something great to watch and to think about. It is an obvious inspiration to hundreds of movies to follow from Star Wars to Alien and beyond. The technology was was beyond its time and set standards for thousands of films to come along.It is an art film, it is science fiction\/drama. It has many long boring parts, but it's a must see film.. I can say if you are not a true lover of movies and one to respect and admire many aspects of film making then this may not be for you.

Hugo Weaving was great, though it was a little disconcerting to see the same guy who played the Elf lord in LOTR, and Agent Smith in the Matrix playing a rather scary looking cross-dressing stage performer. I must say, though, that he cuts a lovely figure in a dress.Terence Stamp was grand as Bernadette, but Guy Pearce was darling. I've seen several of his films, and though I think he's a good actor, the only other one I like is L.A. Confidential (which is one of my favorites in general). Seeing that, then seeing Pearce in this, was probably the best way to go. Had I seen this first, I don't think I could have believed him playing a strait-laced detective. But he was grand, and he makes a gorgeous woman. He also lip-syncs really well. The scenes of him sitting in a giant shoe on top of the bus singing opera were great. How striking to see the long bolts of material streaming along behind the bus.The bus itself - the title character - was a great prop around which the film was crafted. It was pink, temperamental, and instrumental in introducing Bernadette to Bob, played with understated class by Bill Hunter.

Excellent actors and directors always worked with stories that evolved around the Old West myth. And in 1969, when the genre was at the highest pitch of its popularity, Sam Peckinpah made 'The Wild Bunch'. The movie served more like a homage to the Old West, and is regarded even today as one of the best westerns of all time and one of the best Sam Peckinpah's flicks. It is, indeed, an excellent tribute tribute to the Old West.'The Wild Bunch' takes place right before the beginning of World War I and in the height of the Mexican Revolution. To be more precise, the movie is set in the year of 1913, just when the mythical Wild West comes to an end. The plot follows the story of an aging bandits gang, leaden by Pike Bishop (William Holden). After stealing a small town bank, the gang manages to escape, with several of its members dead after a shootout with the local police. But when they check the money, they realize that what they stole were mere stones, with no value at all. This fact alone makes the group realize that the Old West is changing, and that it doesn't have room for people like them anymore. With this feeling of being out of place, the gang heads over to Mexico, to try to have one last big score before retiring. But things aren't gonna as smooth as they tough, because a former member of the gang, Deke Thornton (Robert Ryan) is forced by the police to chase and capture them within a 30-day period - or else, he goes to prison. What follows then is a series of happenings, shootouts, and new characters appearing- all representing the changing of the Wild West. 'The Wild Bunch' Oscar-nominated screenplay was wrote by Sam Peckinpah himself, with the help of Walon Green and Roy N. Sickner. Even though the basic argument of the story feels a lot like other westerns, such as 1968's 'Bandolero!', with a smart guy chasing a bandits gang, 'The Wild Bunch' stills holds its originality because of the treatment the screenplay has. It's all done to make the audience believe that those characters simply don't belong to that place anymore. The scenes where the members of the gang start to laugh for no apparent reason is a great example of that. The dialogs here are a little antiquated, but quite nice. And I kinda enjoyed the way Peckinpah tied the whole story together. The shootouts are amazing, and they don't seem out of place at all, different than what happens to other westerns. It's all made to be a tribute to the Old West, but nothing is forced. An overall great script, incredibly well-written, and with some unforgettable lines.I think that 'The Wild Bunch' is very well-casted. With the exception of the always-great William Holden, which offered a nice performance as Pike Bishop, the gang leader, the acting here isn't what you may call top-notch, but it's not bad either. All the supporting cast does an average job, with Emilio Fernández standing out. I personally thought he was great as General Huerta, one of Mexican revolutionaries to which the gang stumble across, and a character that gets more important over the course of the movie. In the supporting cast, you also have names such as Ben Johnson and Bo Hopkins, actors that worked other times with Sam Peckinpah. And in the main roles, I also enjoyed the work of Ernest Borgnine. But the biggest surprise of 'The Wild Bunch' in terms of acting was someone called Jaime Sánchez. He played Angel, the youngest of the gang members. His work wasn't excellent, but he was far from bad. I can't really understand why his career didn't took off after this movie.'The Wild Bunch' has all the elements which a Sam Peckinpah movie needs. It has lots of blood and violence, specially for a 1969 movie. It even has nudity (!). As a matter of fact, I think it's the movie that has most of these elements, not only for the violence, but mostly because this movie is widely regarded as been the best directing work of Peckinpah, along with 'The Getaway'. Peckinpah really settled the bar for others movies to come, with a very interesting camera work and the fast-cutting action that made him famous. And this Peckinpah-style is in evidence right in the first scene of the movie, when the gang try to rob the bank and enter in a gunfight with the local police. The way Peckinpah films this scene and all others shootouts scenes in the movie is simply amazing, with lots of close-ups and short shots, what makes the gunfight even more frenetic than it is. But Peckinpah not only shows his style in the action scenes, but in the normal ones too. His use of open-shots and close-ups is excellent, and reminded me a lot of George Roy Hill's work in 1969's 'Butch Cassidy and Sundance Kid', a movie that also utilizes these resources. One thing that I though was great in 'The Wild Bunch' was the editing work by Lou Lombardo. It really settled the mood of the picture, specially the opening credits. Very well done. But one thing bothered me about the movie. And it is the original music score by Jerry Fielding. It was quite weak for a western.Overall, 'The Wild Bunch' is a great western, but it has its problems.

I thought that Saving Private Ryan was the best war movie ever made, winning 8 academy awards. That was a movie that really hooked me the most. When I saw the Black Hawk Down trailer, I thought that this would be one of those movies that would only have about 1 to 2 battle scenes (similar to what I expected from Tears of the Sun, although it was a good one). I didn't bother to pay and watch it at the theaters, but Id rather receive a copy once it was released. However, that changed after the first weekend of the movies initial release. I literally heard people talking about it everywhere I went. That concluded me to see the movie ASAP. Im not a theater person, so I planned to buy it. My dad sold DVD's a few years ago. Luckily for me, my dad received an overstock on the film, and he let me have a copy of it. Right when I got home, I immediately fed the DVD into the DVD player. Three hours later, I knew that this was the best war movie ever made, with Saving Private Ryan only coming close. Today I own the movie, book, and the game. Black Hawk Down is the most excellent movie I have ever seen. It has everything needed in a war film, including a graphic field surgery. The movie was well organized, partly because most of the actors underwent real boot camp training. From the first half an hour or so of the movie, I was beginning to become upset since I nearly waited about half an hour until the intensity started flowing. But it was well organized, looking as if the movie was a documentary. When the violent started happening, I was surprised! I have never seen a movie this graphic in detail, that within the first 15 minutes of the war scenes going on I needed to get the kids out of the room. (This movie shouldn't be watched with kids, some images could be too frightening for them, one of the most disturbing scenes showing the the overrun of the 2nd crash site. DO NOT LET CHILDREN VIEW THIS SCENE.) A lot of violence, including the defending of helicopter crash sites, the main concept of the movie. Most deaths in this movie are emotional, including a scene where the a lost rescue convoy is taking heavy fire, and a man is shown severed in half. It isn't shown until after he tells fellow soldiers at his aid, Tell my girls, ill be OK, contributing to emotional deaths, one of the many counted in this movie.

I thought that Saving Private Ryan was the best war movie ever made, winning 8 academy awards. That was a movie that really hooked me the most. When I saw the Black Hawk Down trailer, I thought that this would be one of those movies that would only have about 1 to 2 battle scenes (similar to what I expected from Tears of the Sun, although it was a good one). I didn't bother to pay and watch it at the theaters, but Id rather receive a copy once it was released. However, that changed after the first weekend of the movies initial release. I literally heard people talking about it everywhere I went. That concluded me to see the movie ASAP. Im not a theater person, so I planned to buy it. My dad sold DVD's a few years ago. Luckily for me, my dad received an overstock on the film, and he let me have a copy of it. Right when I got home, I immediately fed the DVD into the DVD player. Three hours later, I knew that this was the best war movie ever made, with Saving Private Ryan only coming close. Today I own the movie, book, and the game. Black Hawk Down is the most excellent movie I have ever seen. It has everything needed in a war film, including a graphic field surgery. The movie was well organized, partly because most of the actors underwent real boot camp training. From the first half an hour or so of the movie, I was beginning to become upset since I nearly waited about half an hour until the intensity started flowing. But it was well organized, looking as if the movie was a documentary. When the violent started happening, I was surprised! I have never seen a movie this graphic in detail, that within the first 15 minutes of the war scenes going on I needed to get the kids out of the room. (This movie shouldn't be watched with kids, some images could be too frightening for them, one of the most disturbing scenes showing the the overrun of the 2nd crash site. DO NOT LET CHILDREN VIEW THIS SCENE.) A lot of violence, including the defending of helicopter crash sites, the main concept of the movie. Most deaths in this movie are emotional, including a scene where the a lost rescue convoy is taking heavy fire, and a man is shown severed in half. It isn't shown until after he tells fellow soldiers at his aid, Tell my girls, ill be OK, contributing to emotional deaths, one of the many counted in this movie.

Then a man enters the cloakroom looking for something that has fallen down a grate that could tie him with the murder of the girl which actually happened several years ago, the man notices Frankie & tries to kill him but paramedics manage to resuscitate him later that night. Frankie remembers what happened but cannot identify his attacker although it is believed to be the 'Cliffside Killer' who has murdered eleven children over the past few years including the girl whose ghost Frankie saw. Frankie decides to investigate the murders & expose the killer with some help from his new ghostly friend...Written, produced & directed by Frank LaLoggia who also composed the music for it Lady in White is a strange film to watch, it mixes all sorts of genres & styles to reasonable if not amazing success. The first thing in the film is a prologue that sets up the older Frankie to tell the story of what happened in 1962 upon his return to Willowpoint Falls after having lived in the city but oddly there is no epilogue at the end that rounds the framing story off which would have finished the film on a natural roundabout sort of way. Lady in White is basically a fairly mild ghost story that goes in many different directions as it's told from the perspective of a young boy it's a coming of age drama, comedic at times emotional tear jerking nostalgic chiller that even has a stab at bringing up the idea of racism from the early 60's. As you would imagine with so many different aspects to the film so it keeps going off in different directions all the time it's a very slow moving film, it's not totally boring as the character's are well fleshed out & the ambiance of the early 60's small town is spot on, you do end up quite liking these people although it's nearly 30 minutes before anything happens & because of that it felt like it took forever to get going & I don't think I would want to watch it again. The ghost story is alright, although the film centers on a child killer the details are kept to a minimum & there's nothing graphic here, the ending is rather sentimental like the rest of the film & it just gets a little bit too mushy. The ghosts here are not evil & merely want to rest in peace which Frankie helps them do eventually, as a slow moving drama dressed up as a ghost film Lady in White is alright but it's not my type of film really & it's far from perfect as the killer is never given any reason or motive & it's never explained why the ring in the grate could have tied him to the little girls murder or the significance of the yearbook Frankie's brother found in the trunk.Apparently writer & director based the ghost story on an actual real life urban legend about a lady in white searching for her missing daughter. The depiction of small town upstate New York life is well realised & a big selling point of the film, the atmosphere & feel of the film will enchant many bit it didn't do much for me. The film has a very natural autumnal feel to it with brown & orange being the primary colours used. There's no real gore although someone is shot & not much violence either, Lady in White goes for mood rather than scares.With a supposed budget of about $4,700,000 this had a lot more money behind it than many independent horror films ever had or ever will have, it looks nice enough & has good production values although some of the special effects have dated badly. The acting is very good here & one of the films strongest points, the child actor's have that rare ability not to be annoying & feel natural & at ease while director LaLoggia has an uncredited cameo as Frankie later in life during the opening prologue.Lady in White is an odd film that feels like a mix of ideas & themes, it's a very slow film which I think hurts it but the quaint small town drama of family life intertwined with a ghost story may be enough for some to like it.

Despite fears that a sequel would never be as good as the original and the film technically under-performance this is one of the few sequels that was better then the original.Despite the Rebel Alliance destroying the Death Star and the universe now safe from the ultimate weapon the Empire had gone on the offensive against the rebels, hounding them out of the bases. They are led by Darth Vader (David Prowse\/James Earl Jones), the most fearsome commander for the Empire. On the ice planet Hoth, the Rebels have to fled when the Empire's forces attack. Within the Rebel camp Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamall) receives a message from Obi-Wan Ben Kenobi (Alec Guinness) from beyond the grave to go to the planet Dagobah and learn the ways of the Jedi from a powerful master Yoda (Frank Oz). His friends Hans Solo (Harrison Ford), Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher), Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew) and 3CPO (Anthony Daniels) have to escape Hoth and end up being chased by Darth Vader. They set out for safety to the Cloud City led by Hans' friend Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams). Vader himself becomes obsessed about finding the Millennium Falcon, and Luke who becomes a major threat to the Empire.Lucas did the smartest thing he could with this sequel, he took more of a back sit. It is known that he is not the best screenwriter and director in the world, but is he a great producer and ideas man. He came up with the basic story idea and wrote some of the key scenes, but it was Leigh Brackett and Lawrence Kasdan who wrote most of the screenplay and Irvin Kershner was brought in to direct. This team made a brilliant sequel expanding on the ideas of the original ideas of the film, from the mystical powers of the Jedi to the multiple worlds and creatures that are created to how the Empire function, which was a cross between the Roman Empire and Nazi Germany. Brackett and Kasdan with Kershner's direction were able to interweave multiple story lines in a space set epic. Like the original the Empire Strikes Back was able to use many sci-fi ideas into the film, multiple alien races, psychic powers, grant designs of futuristic weapons and warfare and a setting crossing fighting a dictatorship and general lawlessness. Kershner was able to make a atmospheric film which a darker in tone, particularly in the third act. He shot some of the best action sequences in the whole series, like the battle of Hoth, and the fight between Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader was not just an excellent fight but also brooding experience, filled with tension and is one of the best sequences in film history. As well as it being the best Star Wars film it is also Kershner best film by a long way. Despite the darker tone Kershner was still able to lighten the film enough and allow the audience to relax with some well timed humour.The characters are developed even further. Darth Vader is even more menacing then he was in the first film with a dark ambition and secret, making him one of the best screen villains ever. He oozes a dark charisma and he is as ruthless as Hitler, Stalin and Mao when it came to military command and tactics. The relationship between Leia and Hans Solo also improves, from hating each other to discovering their true feelings. Luke too grows from a competent commander to a man who has to discovery his destiny, but also prone to his emotions, when he needed to master them. Billy Dee Williams is an excellent addition to the series and his character represent a moral dualities that inflecting the world they live in.

The visuals are simply stunning, I will go and say the best the 90's anime have seen. This movie will entertain you and make you think, there's a lot more to it than gods, demons, ecological messages, smooth and violent action sequences or beautiful emotional scenes. Watch how every character's action in this story can affect everyone and everything around them.

For those of you who don't know, Newfoundlands are large (average weight being 160 pounds), friendly dogs. I was worried by watching a horror movie about a rabid St. Bernard that I might become afraid of my friend's dog. I needn't have worried. Cujo is too boring and stupid to scare anyone.Cujo is a friendly St. Bernard who when chasing a rabbit, gets his head into something he shouldn't a cave filled with bats (are there bats that actually live in rabbit holes?). Anyway, poor Cujo gets bitten by a bat, and at first he seems to be the same normal, happy, lovable dog. But then he starts changing.The film is divided into two parts. The first is a trite and boring story about marital infidelity, and the second is a drawn out segment of a mom and her son being trapped in a broken down car with Cujo lurking outside.Neither one of these stories is even remotely entertaining. The first half of the movie is meant to introduce us to the characters, but it's so boring and stupid, and the characters never even achieve two-dimensionality. The second part of the story is the horror part of the movie, but it's not any better.First of all, the film has some very large credibility issues. I'm not a veterinarian, but I don't think a dog who has gone insane from rabies is capable of such devious plans as Cujo is. It becomes a war of attrition between Cujo, and Donna (Dee Wallace) and her son, Tad (Danny Pinero). If a dog has rabies, is he really going to be able to just sit and wait for his potential victims to get out of the car? I would be more willing to give a little leeway to the movie, but it's got an even bigger problem Cujo isn't particularly frightening. As messy and bloody as he looks, Cujo always has those sad puppy dog eyes that make you want to give him a hug (and a bath) rather than run away. How do you expect a film to scare someone when the the villain is a dog who looks at you like he's sorry for chewing your shoes? The attempts to make him menacing fail in the same way. When he attacks someone, he looks as if he's just happy to see them.The acting is flat, which only makes matters worse for this misbegotten project. Dee Wallace is not your average scream queen, despite her popularity in the genre. For one thing, she's not a big breasted teenage girl; she's a mom. This could have been an effective way to build suspense, but neither she nor her son are developed enough to really make it work. Daniel Hugh-Kelly looks more like Greg Brady than a horror movie character, and he acts like it. No one else is on screen long enough to make an impression (although the guy who plays the owner of the car repair shop looks the part).Don't be intrigued by the hype. It was said to have one of the scariest scenes in movie history (I would be interested to figure out which one it was), but the fact that the ranking was done by Bravo alone should tell you that that means zip.Cujo isn't scary, just stupid.

This garbage belongs in the latter, it was so awful(in my opinion that is) that I didn't know whether to vomit or cry. I will give credit and say it is not quite the worst movie I have ever seen, but that isn't saying much.Firstly, I do have to agree with other reviewers that this is one of the poorly written kids movies out there. I know this movie is supposed to be bad and mindless trash, but the dialogue alone makes it not only bad, it makes it garbage. The dialogue is mega lame and not quotable at all, and I didn't laugh once. The humour was also very grotesque, I know the cards are quite grotesque, and movies like Freddy Got Fingered had grotesque and very unsubtle humour, but The Garbage Pail Kids Movie takes the whole meaning of the word grotesque to a whole new level and in a bad way. Plus the pranks are very mean-spirited, as is the knockabout violence.Then there is the story. What was the story again? To me, it had those talentless hacks Friedberg and Seltzer written over it, it is one of the most poorly constructed stories in a movie, with drawn out scenes, plodding pace you name it. Next, the production values, am I the only person who thought they were appalling?

It had been nearly three years since the film was released, but I had never even heard of it until just before I watched a rented DVD copy of it that summer. Jack Black's starring role in this movie was the reason why I was interested in seeing it, as it had been less than a year since I had gone to see The School of Rock in the theatre, which made me become a big fan of the comedian. I remember my first viewing of Shallow Hal very well, but don't remember finding it very funny at all. Nearly six years later, I've finally seen again, and I thought it was good for a while this time, but it certainly wasn't consistent enough to be 100% satisfying.At the age of nine, Hal Larson sees his father dying in the hospital. Reverend Larson is not himself due to all the painkillers he has taken, and just before he dies, he tells his son to only date women based on their physical appearance. Because of this, Hal grows into a very shallow man, only going after physically attractive women, while his shallow best friend, Mauricio Wilson, does the same, and neither of them has been romantically successful this way. One day, Hal finds himself trapped in an elevator with famous self-help specialist Tony Robbins, who hypnotizes him, making him able to see inner beauty! Hal now sees inner beauty as outer beauty, meaning whenever he sees anyone who happens to be good-natured, they look physically beautiful to him, even if they do not look this way to most people. He soon meets a young woman named Rosemary Shanahan, the daughter of his boss, Steve Shanahan. In Hal's eyes, she is good looking and svelte, even though she is actually morbidly obese. The two of them fall in love, but Mauricio really wants the old Hal back, which could lead to trouble!The movie starts with a sequence showing nine year old Hal and his dying father, and this part didn't do much for me, but after that, the story skips forward to Hal as an adult, played by Jack Black. We also have Jason Alexander playing Mauricio. The comedic talents of these two definitely help with the laughs. Early in the film, they say some really funny things, such as Mauricio's reason for breaking up with a certain woman. It's steadily funny for a little while, but eventually loses it. For some reason, I didn't find the relationship between Hal and Rosemary (played by Gwyneth Paltrow) that interesting, at least not around the time it begins. There are also some unfunny obesity gags, such as Rosemary breaking a couple restaurant chairs, and the same character jumping into a swimming pool and sending a kid flying from the water up into a tree. These aren't the only failed attempts to be funny. We also hear Mauricio talking about his turd at one point, and there were definitely a number of other parts where I kept a straight face, though there were more times when I laughed, even if they were sporadic, and the serious scenes don't hurt the film.I watched this 2001 Farrelly Brothers movie for the first time in years after doing the same with Kingpin, an earlier comedy of theirs last month.

However, even though neither of them is as popular is the brothers' 1998 smash hit, There's Something About Mary, I think they're both funnier than that vastly overrated romantic comedy. Shallow Hal does have its humorous moments as well as some good serious ones, and it also has a message about how physical appearance isn't everything, though the Farrellys' irreverence could offend a lot of people and make the message seem insincere to them.

I finally got my hands on the Uncut Director's Edition of Caligula. I can only assume that some of the folks on here saying that this movie is not that pornographic have only seen some chopped up, edited version. It is most definitely porn. We see lots of BJ's and tons of straight up sex. Lots of it appears to have been spliced in after the fact and does nothing for the movie at all.The costumes and the sets here are atrocious. It's something like Planet of the Apes meets Clash of the Titans meets Masters of the Universe (the one with Dolph Lundgren) meets some random, off-Broadway play. Too many scenes are filmed on what is just a plain, black stage with cheesy backdrops. The props are awful and embarrassing.There are a few good gore scenes, but nothing that will impress an Italian horror buff or a gorehound.

A standard nightmare made a hundred times worse by the struggle to get his dad to act like a man's man before the moralistic Gene Hackman and his family (the wife - the wonderful Dianne Wiest, the daughter and prospective bride - a young Calista Flockhart) arrive. Then there's the little matter of convincing house-servant Agador (Hank Azaria) to wear something not entirely inappropriate. Really, it's enough to make your mascara run.Having not seen the original movie this was based on, I can't say whether fans of that film would like this one or not. What I can say is that director Mike Nichols has given us a great comedy, helped immensely by the performances of absolutely everyone involved. Nathan Lane can do comically camp in his sleep and is at his best here, Williams gets some absolutely priceless one-liners, Futterman is suitably nervous, the always enjoyable Hank Azaria is just hilarious and Hackman, Wiest and Flockhart react wonderfully to everything that goes on around them. There's also a nice little turn from Christine Baranski and numerous farcical moments that never feel as fake or strained as farce sometimes can.It's all pretty predictable and the ending, for me anyway, was a bit sudden after such a great time spent building things up but the journey from A to B is undeniably entertaining, even if all of the roles are really nothing but cardboard cut-out stereotypes of gay men, drag queens and those morally opposed to such people. For those offended by such stereotyping and comedy campness I'd just remind you that, through everything that happens here, Williams and Lane make a genuinely splendid, loving and lovable couple. Which is more than can be said for many other couples in comedy movies, whatever their sexual orientation.A fast and frantic farce that actually delivers the big laughs along with a number of chuckles throughout, it's just a shame about that ending that feels so rushed and slapdash.See this if you like La Cage Aux Folles, The Gay Decievers, Happy, Texas.

But instead it is hampered by clichés and formula scenes patched together in a sequence resembling the barest of plots. Improbable coincidences occur, Indians are dispatched as usual, backprojection is plainly used for some of the rafting scenes, and there is even a potential rape of the Monroe character by the Mitchum character.For me this makes for a movie to miss, if not dismiss. It has exciting elements, some high adventure filming in the water, and some singing by Monroe (all of which is widely available on collections of her music). Mitchum is a little less at ease here than in other films, hard to speculate why, though he was drinking heavily at the time. Preminger also didn't get along with Monroe (or Monroe's acting coach who interfered with every scene). Monroe thought it was her worst film. All of this matters in a movie with little else going on. Certainly the movie is beautiful, partly for the scenery (it was shot in the Canadian Rockies, which are breathtaking) and partly for the cinematography, which is widescreen brilliance, no question there. The simplified notion of pioneer days out west is sometimes almost quaint, the boy learning to shoot, the fight with a wild cat, and even the river as nature untamed. I don't really recommend the film except for Mitchum\/Monroe fans, or for those who (like me) are aware of LaShelle's work.

This is heavy stuff, there's not even any real incidental laughs here as the movie draws you into a situation that starts off quite badly and just gets bleaker and bleaker.The acting is all pretty good - Diane Keaton, Mary Beth Hurt and Kristin Griffith are all fine as the sisters, Geraldine Page is excellent playing a character difficult to connect to but easy to see why she is acting in such a way, E.G.

This is a complex movie, and while it stretches credibility to its limits, it is for the most part perfectly coherent, and it does something that most movies are unable to do build suspense.A woman (Emma Thompson) was found trying to break into a convent. She doesn't speak and appears to be harmless, so the nuns let her stay there. But she has violent nightmares every night, and the nuns get a private investigator named Mike Church (Kenneth Branagh) to find out who she is. A hypnotist named Franklyn Madson (Derek Jacobi) offers to help, and under hypnosis, she begins revealing an interesting story from the past the high profile murder of Margaret Strauss (Emma Thompson) by her husband, Roman (Kenneth Branagh). Madson thinks it might be memories of a past life, and as the evidence piles up, is Grace (as Mike names her) now in danger?It's a very complex story, and save for one scene, it's well told. Hitchcock lovers would do themselves a favor by checking out this thriller (despite references to a murder with a pair of scissors, this isn't a slasher movie). It's a fascinating story and the suspense builds slowly and surely to the tension-wracked end.The acting is top-notch. Kenneth Branagh has what is arguably the toughest job. He plays two completely different characters, neither of which are in his comfort zone. Branagh would probably be the last person on anyone's list to play a 40's era noir gumshoe, but he acquits himself quite well actually. His portrayal of the musician is just as good. Branagh's then-wife, Emma Thompson, gives an equally terrific performance. She's an amnesiac, but we really grow to like her, and her romances with Mike (as Grace) and Roman (as Margaret) are very effective. What is really surprising is that the romance between Roman and Margaret Strauss is effective, and that gives the film another level that the film wouldn't have had if it was treated as a mere plot device. Derek Jacobi is delicious as Madson, the hypnotist. I don't want to give anything away, but Jacobi plays him in a delightfully (but effectively) off-the-wall manner. Brief, but important appearances by Robin Williams (as a former psychiatrist) and Wayne Knight (as Mike's friend at the newspaper) are also effective. Special mention has to go to Campbell Scott, who despite being in only one scene, is very good (watch his reaction shot at the climax of his scene).Kenneth Branagh is known for bringing Shakespeare to the screen. He has adapted a number of The Bard's plays successfully, including making at masterful, uncut version of Hamlet (also starring Jacobi). But his love letter to film noir is also an suspenseful entry into the genre, and the plot (from a script penned by Scott Frank) is twisted enough to bring back memories of those potboilers.Suspenseful and emotionally effective, Dead Again is forgotten thriller that should be better known than it is.

The trouble is that Harry is dead, and we can't seem to get a handle on how he died.

The humor is dry and deadpan, and the movie is not played for laughs, but the laughs are there. You'll get a lot of laughs from the corpse; I'd never have thought a body could be so funny just lying there. (Harry was played by Philip Truex, in what appears to have been his last movie role.)

","genre":"Comedy, Mystery"},{"date":"17 April 2010","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" This is a subtle comedy from Alfred Hitchcock, made in 1954 but remarkably undated. John Forsythe and Edmund Gwynne are listed as the stars, and the movie introduces Shirley MacLaine in her first film role at the tender age of twenty.Forsythe plays Sam Marlowe, an artist in a New England village too small even to be quaint, and MacLaine plays the recently widowed Jennifer Rogers. The trouble is that Harry is dead, and we can't seem to get a handle on how he died. We do seem to have a handle on Harry though, as he's buried and dug up again four times.The movie holds up very well today, although the prices are outrageously low and Jennifer is entirely casual about letting her son go out and play, handle dead rabbits, and walk around dead bodies. (Some may remember that back in the Fifties children were encouraged to go outside and play, as it was considered healthy.) The humor is dry and deadpan, and the movie is not played for laughs, but the laughs are there. You'll get a lot of laughs from the corpse; I'd never have thought a body could be so funny just lying there. (Harry was played by Philip Truex, in what appears to have been his last movie role.) Everyone in the movie clicks with his or her role, no one rings untrue, and Hitchcock toys with us with a door that won't stay shut. We all think of his mysteries, but Hitchcock was an excellent all around director - even with comedies.If you've never seen Shirley MacLaine in her 1950s movies when she was twenty-something, you'll find that she was an attractive, engaging woman. If you like her in this, I'd suggest renting My Geisha with Yves Montand and Robert Cummings. She's in her 30s in My Geisha, and she's hit her stride. Nobody kisses on screen as well as MacLaine did, and she really was an excellent actress. ","genre":"Comedy, Mystery"}]
