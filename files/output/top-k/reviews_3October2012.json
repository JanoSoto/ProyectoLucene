Being a little scared is something that is expected when watching a horror film especially Dracula and that fear was not there throughout the film. The acting was great by Dracula but for the rest of the characters it could of been a little less dramatic. The overall movie was good but not to the level of being scary that I expected to see. There was not much suspension throughout the movie you could figure out what was going to happen in the end of the movie even if you have never seen a Dracula film ","genre":null},{"date":"3 October 2012","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Dracula is an OK movie, it got a tad bit confusing and the way that the ending was is a little anti climactic compared to what my expectations are for this film, the lighting was good but the scenes where only there eyes were being focused on did not give the feeling of fear.

While I tend to promote him a bit more than probably anyone else (having written the only known biography), I feel he deserves the recognition. Judging this film by its direction may be hard to do... there is limited inventiveness. But it is more than adequately handled, and there is at least one interesting use of the camera, allowing the audience to look into the pool.This film is probably considered the lowest ranking or least known of the original Universal horror films (Wolf Man, Dracula, Frankenstein). I am torn between calling it fair and unfair. Certainly I think the film should be seen by more people, but I have to admit there is just no way to make a mummy as interesting as a vampire or werewolf.And there is the historical nature. Frankenstein goes back to 1818 and had previously been made into a movie by Thomas Edison. Dracula goes to 1897, with vampire tales going back much further. The werewolf dates to at least the Middle Ages. Mummies in a horror context trace to 1827, but were not really interesting to the general public until the Egyptology boom and the discovery of King Tut in 1922. Regarding the acting, Karloff, of course, steals the show. David Manners is disposable and could have been played by anyone. Zita Johann? I am mixed. She has a distinctive look, but could she have been replaced? Probably. Something about her voice seems out of place with the rest of the film, even if she delivers the film's most memorable line (about opening graves).

The film stars Christopher 'Dracula' Lee', who along with his band of clergy men stabs the creatures through the heart with silver stakes in Transylvania. These things scream 'Vampire' to me. Even the way the 'were-wolves' act is more akin to vampires, especially the lurid sex scenes which would have been far less embarrassing to look at if they where not covered in fur on top of that there is a strange bat monster near the end for no reason what so ever. If it had been the same cast, same basic plot, same budget and was about vampires it would have been a decent film.The were-wolf effects are so inconsistent it's cringe worthy, ranging from actors with some cheap fangs who look like the rolled around on a barber's floor to full on gorilla costumes. Don't expect anything close to the effects from the original movie.
