However, the only student running for the position is the overly keen Tracey Flick &#150; a driven student who he feels is callous and blames for his best friend being fired for falling in love with her. Desperate to prevent her becoming president, James convinces injured jock Paul to run, prompting Paul's love-scorned sister to also stand. Where once the presidency was a good clean-cut race, Tracey takes the competition badly, and it descends into something a lot more sinister.I wasn't totally sure about this film but I had heard good things about it and, even though the fact that it was an MTV Production put me off a bit, I decided to give it a try. The film is quite clever for the most part and takes the worn genre and clichés of high school movies and makes them into a quite good little political satire of sorts &#150; albeit one that is rather downbeat at times. The comedy is not laugh out loud funny and maybe that's a problem, but I enjoyed the parallels with modern politics (and sexual issues) and found it to make some good points in a funny way. Of course the end is rather downbeat but only because it is sadly believable.I must say that I was rather put off by a couple of different things. The first was the amount of sexual material in the film &#150; not a real problem but I was a little put off by how graphically the subject of underage sex was dealt with. This was a minor problem (if you can pardon the pun!) but what I found a little worrying was Payne's apparent misogynistic touch on the film &#150; all the men were hapless saps and the women held the real power all the way; I'm not saying this is not true but Payne has little sympathy for his female characters and they may come off better overall but there is no love lost for them.The cast opens with an amusing bit of role reversal that sees everyone's favourite high school student become a teacher in the shape of Matthew Broderick. Hardly having the best run of roles for a while, he is actually pretty good here even if some of what happens to his character doesn't seem to fit very well. Witherspoon is annoying but the difference here is that it is intentional! She easily fits into the character and her role has a great touch to it &#150; I'm not saying it is easy to enjoy her performance but she is good. Klein does his usual dumb jock thing but is fortunate that he has the material to support (this time) but I felt Campbell was left with a sympathetic character that was placed on the sidelines too much.Overall I enjoyed this film but it had its limitations. It isn't hilariously funny as many coming to this genre may expect but it is quite cleverly written. The story struggles a bit as it goes along, with threads left hanging that stop it being as tight as it maybe could have been but generally I enjoyed it but can see why some others have problems with it.

I can't understand why I do this because I really do enjoy this film even though there is much I sort of dislike about it. The plot is one of the weak points; generally it is quite good as an idea but it has many weak points that make it seem rather silly and overly busy. While this is not enough to really damage the film I know that it has put some people off in some audiences, but for me it was only a minor problem as these rather silly bits were all part of a film that had a great sense of fun running through it. Some of it didn't make much sense and at times I got the feeling that the film had more ideas than it really knew what to do with, but the majority of it worked well. The action is good but you should be prepared for the fact that, like much of the film, it is done with a certain amount of tongue in cheek humour. Suffice to say I never found it dull and it has plenty going on for the majority of the filmVisually is the area where the film is strongest and I could watch it for this alone. The effects are great and are full of imagination as well as looking very impressive. The design work of Dan Weil is very well used and compliments the effects used &#150; the film looks lavish and rich all the way through and matches the wonderful costumes from Jean-Paul Gaultier. Of course much of the praise goes to Luc Besson who has managed to pull this together really well to produce an endlessly impressive film, which manages to be a fun and exciting sci-fi.The casting also backs this idea up and features many performances that are spot on with tongue in cheek performances that match the tone of the film perfectly. Bruce Willis delivers the same, great mocking performance that he tried in Hudson Hawk but here he does it in a film that is better structured and less silly than that one and it works a lot better. He still delivers the goods as an action lead but he puts his tongue just far enough in his cheek so as to be there without hurting the film! I don't want to overdo it (after all &#150; he is Bruce Willis!) but I thought he was very well cast here. Oldman is very hammy but this also works as it matches the humour of the piece. Jovovich had a very difficult role and it is easy to laugh at her baby talk etc but I think she made it work well and gave a good performance against the odds. Holm is pretty good and brings humour to his role as well. Tucker, sadly, fails to do the same as these and his overblown performance doesn't even fit well within this film (god knows where it WOULD fit!) and he only succeeds in being shrill and very annoying throughout &#150; not all his fault, his character is a wholly unnecessary part of the film. The support cast is roundly good and features a raft of famous faces in minor roles including Lee Evans, Brion James, Tricky, Luke Perry and Kim Chan.

I love alien movies and this is the ultimate one to watch! It has the most unusual all star cast which all perform well, great music by David Arnold, and some of the greatest special effects ever seen in a movie. I don't know about other people but I believe in aliens and other life in the universe. There is just so much out there and who are we to say that we are alone? To think that there could be hundreds of thousands of intelligent species on other worlds is such an extraordinary thought. In My opinion most of the things in this movie are accurate. In My opinion ID-4 is one of the greatest movies ever made! Below is an In-depth look at most of the characters in the film!Bill Pullman as President Thomas J. Whitmore - He is the President of the United States of America. He fought in the Gulf War. He is an excellent pilot and an intelligent man. Invading forces are entering the Earth's atmosphere and this means that the United States and the rest of the world is going to have company like it never has had and the President must make decisions like never before!Jeff Goldblum as David Levinson - This tall man is a cable worker and he is a computer genius not to mention is a very smart man to begin with. He will play a big part in trying to save the world.Margaret Colin as Constance Spano - She is the secretary to the president. She also has had long relationship David Levinson and as time goes on it looks like they will be back together again!Will Smith as Capt. Steven Hiller - This smart fighter pilot is really a daredevil. He lives with his girlfriend Jasmine Dubrow and her young son Dylan. Will Capt. Steven Hiller marry this attractive woman if he goes out fights an enemy like the world has never seen? Judd Hirsch as Julius Levinson - He is the father of David Levinson. He gives David a great idea and if it wasn't for him the world wouldn't have an advantage against the aliens.Mary McDonnell as First Lady Marilyn Whitmore - The wife of the President of the USA. Her and Thomas J. Whitmore are a very close couple.Randy Quaid as Russell Casse - This man served in Viet Nam and was abducted by aliens many years. He may have become a alcoholic but when the time comes he'll quit and try to save the world!Robert Loggia as General William M. Grey - This top official is the first to know about the invaders from another world!James Rebhorn as Albert Nimziki - This Secretary of Defense has not told the President everything!Harvey Fierstein as Marty Gilbert - This man cares about his brother, his mother, his housekeeper and ever his lawyer. Adam Baldwin as Major Mitchell - This large man is one of the high commanding officers in Area 51! Brent Spiner as Dr. Brackish Okun - He is the head doctor in Area 51 and has had the experience at studying alien life and the arsenal they possess!Vivica A. Fox as Jasmine Dubrow - This beauty has been waiting for Capt. Steven Hiller to marry her. Since things in the world have gotten a little bit out of hand their marriage has to halt.Ross Bagley as Dylan Dubrow - He is the young boy of Jasmine Dubrow. Mae Whitman as Patricia Whitmore - She is the young daughter of the President and the First Lady.James Duval as Miguel Casse, Lisa Jakub as Alicia Casse, Giuseppe Andrews as Troy Casse - They are Russell Casse' kids.Bill Smitrovich as Captain Watson - He gives orders to the fighters that will have a dog fight like they have never imagined! Harry Connick Jr. as Captain Jimmy Wilder - This wild pilot has a charming personality and is Capt. Steven Hiller's best friend. Leland Orser as Tech\/Medical Assistant #1 - When there's an emergency procedure he along with Dr. Brackish Okun must perform an unbelievable surgery on a being from another planet!Erick Avari as SETI Chief - After being woken up and banging his head he hears the extraordinary sound of other life on the phone!Dean Devlin as Eagle 2 Pilot - This fighter pilot will have a flying time of his life!Movie Nuttball's NOTEIf love Roland Emmerich then I recommend that you see the following films Making Contact (a very different movie), Universal Soldier (an awesome movie, one of the best!), Stargate (another excellent film!), Godzilla 1998 (Don't get Me wrong, its a great movie but I still feel that it is nothing like the classic Godzilla movies so I only recommend you see it if you like American monster films and\/or Roland Emmerich), The Patriot,(2000, this is fine film!), and The Day After Tomorrow (Great movie!) If you like alien movies and\/or the subject of aliens I also recommend the following films The Thing from another World, The War of the Worlds, The Day the Earth Stood Still, The UFO Incident, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, John Carpenter's The Thing, Krull, Time Walker, My Science Project, Howard the Duck, John Carpenter's Starman, John Carpenter's They Live, Mac and Me, Explorers, Invaders from Mars, Total Recall, The Abyss, Communion, Suburban Commando, Fire in the Sky, The Arrival, Mars Attacks!

I love alien movies and this is the ultimate one to watch! It has the most unusual all star cast which all perform well, great music by David Arnold, and some of the greatest special effects ever seen in a movie. I don't know about other people but I believe in aliens and other life in the universe. There is just so much out there and who are we to say that we are alone? To think that there could be hundreds of thousands of intelligent species on other worlds is such an extraordinary thought. In My opinion most of the things in this movie are accurate. In My opinion ID-4 is one of the greatest movies ever made! Below is an In-depth look at most of the characters in the film!Bill Pullman as President Thomas J. Whitmore - He is the President of the United States of America. He fought in the Gulf War. He is an excellent pilot and an intelligent man. Invading forces are entering the Earth's atmosphere and this means that the United States and the rest of the world is going to have company like it never has had and the President must make decisions like never before!Jeff Goldblum as David Levinson - This tall man is a cable worker and he is a computer genius not to mention is a very smart man to begin with. He will play a big part in trying to save the world.Margaret Colin as Constance Spano - She is the secretary to the president. She also has had long relationship David Levinson and as time goes on it looks like they will be back together again!Will Smith as Capt. Steven Hiller - This smart fighter pilot is really a daredevil. He lives with his girlfriend Jasmine Dubrow and her young son Dylan. Will Capt. Steven Hiller marry this attractive woman if he goes out fights an enemy like the world has never seen? Judd Hirsch as Julius Levinson - He is the father of David Levinson. He gives David a great idea and if it wasn't for him the world wouldn't have an advantage against the aliens.Mary McDonnell as First Lady Marilyn Whitmore - The wife of the President of the USA. Her and Thomas J. Whitmore are a very close couple.Randy Quaid as Russell Casse - This man served in Viet Nam and was abducted by aliens many years. He may have become a alcoholic but when the time comes he'll quit and try to save the world!Robert Loggia as General William M. Grey - This top official is the first to know about the invaders from another world!James Rebhorn as Albert Nimziki - This Secretary of Defense has not told the President everything!Harvey Fierstein as Marty Gilbert - This man cares about his brother, his mother, his housekeeper and ever his lawyer. Adam Baldwin as Major Mitchell - This large man is one of the high commanding officers in Area 51! Brent Spiner as Dr. Brackish Okun - He is the head doctor in Area 51 and has had the experience at studying alien life and the arsenal they possess!Vivica A. Fox as Jasmine Dubrow - This beauty has been waiting for Capt. Steven Hiller to marry her. Since things in the world have gotten a little bit out of hand their marriage has to halt.Ross Bagley as Dylan Dubrow - He is the young boy of Jasmine Dubrow. Mae Whitman as Patricia Whitmore - She is the young daughter of the President and the First Lady.James Duval as Miguel Casse, Lisa Jakub as Alicia Casse, Giuseppe Andrews as Troy Casse - They are Russell Casse' kids.Bill Smitrovich as Captain Watson - He gives orders to the fighters that will have a dog fight like they have never imagined! Harry Connick Jr. as Captain Jimmy Wilder - This wild pilot has a charming personality and is Capt. Steven Hiller's best friend. Leland Orser as Tech\/Medical Assistant #1 - When there's an emergency procedure he along with Dr. Brackish Okun must perform an unbelievable surgery on a being from another planet!Erick Avari as SETI Chief - After being woken up and banging his head he hears the extraordinary sound of other life on the phone!Dean Devlin as Eagle 2 Pilot - This fighter pilot will have a flying time of his life!Movie Nuttball's NOTEIf love Roland Emmerich then I recommend that you see the following films Making Contact (a very different movie), Universal Soldier (an awesome movie, one of the best!), Stargate (another excellent film!), Godzilla 1998 (Don't get Me wrong, its a great movie but I still feel that it is nothing like the classic Godzilla movies so I only recommend you see it if you like American monster films and\/or Roland Emmerich), The Patriot,(2000, this is fine film!), and The Day After Tomorrow (Great movie!) If you like alien movies and\/or the subject of aliens I also recommend the following films The Thing from another World, The War of the Worlds, The Day the Earth Stood Still, The UFO Incident, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, John Carpenter's The Thing, Krull, Time Walker, My Science Project, Howard the Duck, John Carpenter's Starman, John Carpenter's They Live, Mac and Me, Explorers, Invaders from Mars, Total Recall, The Abyss, Communion, Suburban Commando, Fire in the Sky, The Arrival, Mars Attacks!
