","genre":"Action, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"6 March 2010","score":"","review":" Well, it's clearly a ripoff of Bonny and Clyde, from the old 1930s square-sided cars (often rolling over) and the chattering Tommy guns spraying lead all over the place and the rollicking getaways and the brazen self-promotion during the robberies to the hokey banjo music that accompanies everything.I enjoyed the splendid performances of Angie Dickenson as a thoroughly unbelievable redneck Mamma of two pretty girls, given to industrial-strength language, and Tom Skerritt, miscast as a footloose no-goodnik, and the hammy William Shattner as a Louisville aristocrat who prefers mint juleps and a gentleman's game of poker to loud noises. Dick Miller's presence is always welcome. His chin simply juts. Angie Dickinson is marvelous. She looks just fine, especially with no clothes on. The sinewy, supple type, you know. Skerritt and Schatner both get chances to savor her indisputable charms. The young girls are splendid too. Skerritt gets a crack at both of them -- at the same time. Kids Please leave the room for a moment. Thank you. I said THANK YOU. Now, Mom and Dad, this business of having a threesome is known in cosmopolitan circles as a menage a trois, sometimes misspelled by the less sophisticated as menage a twot. Okay? Right. Boys and girls, you can COME IN now.I kind of liked it. It's unpretentious garbage. It's made for the drive-ins and must have been lots of undemanding fun for an undemanding audience. A lot of people get shot up between the nudity and the vulgar exchanges. It follows that the bandit leaders must themselves be extinguished, and so they are, by gunshot. The men die instantly, perforated by a thousand bullets. Angie Dickenson dies gently, with a wan smile on her face, only a trickle of Technicolor number 9 red down her delicate arm betraying the presence of the fatal wound. But they're free, thrumming along a dusty road in a convertible, and Big Bad Mamma has saved her two young offspring for better things than a life of crime.Frankly, I don't see much ahead of the two little lambs, although who knows? The blond has an attractive face and saucy figure and one can imagine her as the illicit, pampered pet of some millionaire rock star from New York or Georgia -- that is until the house collapses around them. The pregnant younger daughter, a retard by any metric, who insists on toting around her teddy bear, is a different story. She's made for a career in politics.
