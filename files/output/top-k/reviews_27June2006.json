Ted Striker (Robert Hays), who just HAPPENS to be on board!That said, there are some funny moments in Airplane II The Sequel.

Otherwise, it's all stuff we've already seen, as Finkleman thinks he can successfully entertain us by reviving the same characters (Peter Graves'perverted pilot) and visual gags (the deadly effects of Striker's I love Elaine monologues, part of the Saturday Night Fever parody, et al). Shame he didn't bring back the one guy who would have made a difference Leslie Nielsen. He was the best element of Airplane!, yet he's absent in the sequel. There are a few new entries (Raymond Burr as a judge and William Shatner playing an astronaut) who may induce a smile in film-buffs, but sadly, no laughter.Those who haven't seen the original Airplane!

The Broadway play was set entirely in the living room of George and Martha's home and starred Uta Hagen, Arthur Hill, Melinda Dillon, and George Grizzard. All eminently respectable players, but none of them exactly movie box office.This film was destined to make money when the most publicized couple of the decade, Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton, chose it as a star vehicle for themselves. Of course what was not clear was how well a one stage play would adapt to film.It adapted very well and went quite beyond one stage. The action of the film moved effortlessly to an all night diner at one point with some stops along the way. You'd hardly know the story as originally told only had one setting.There's no real plot to it. For reasons I can't fathom this middle aged and bitter couple George and Martha have a younger couple, Nick and Honey, over to their house at two in the morning. I don't know about you, but I'm usually not my best at that time. Also they had just come from a party at Martha's father's house. Martha's dad is the president of a college and George teaches there. Nick and Honey are a newly hired professor and his wife.The late night and the liquor bring out the worst in everybody. A whole lot of ugly truths get told.Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf was the summit of the professional team of Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton. Playing against type, Elizabeth Taylor got her second Oscar the one she felt she earned. She always disparaged the one received for Butterfield 8 as it came on the heels of her well publicized pneumonia bout.In fact all four members of the cast were nominated with Sandy Dennis winning Best Supporting Actress. Ironically Richard Burton didn't win, losing to Paul Scofield for A Man for All Seasons. I guess the Academy voters figured Burton would get another shot. He never brought home the big prize though.George Segal usually gets overlooked. This film and Ship of Fools was the start of his long career, but no Oscar for him either.Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf is quite the indictment against marriage, especially after the love has died. It's far from the whole story of marriage. There are many who stay married longer than George and Martha and happily. But it wasn't in Edward Albee's life experience to draw from.

A few words to describe Dr. Henry Frankenstein (Colin Clive) who, along with his freakish sidekick Fritz (Dwight Frye), attempts to challenge the authority of even God To animate the dead. His lovely wife Elizabeth (Mae Clarke), his old professor Dr. Waldman (Edward Van Sloan), and his father Baron Frankenstein (Frederick Kerr) all try to prevent try to prevent the hellish uprising, but even they cannot stop it. Soon, the monster is on the lose, and, to the horror of Frankenstein, terrorizing the countryside...What sets Frankenstein's monster apart from other Universal Monsters, such as the voluptuous Dracula, is that Frankenstein's monster is sympathetic, in the sense that he is a mere product of science, with a longing for human contact. Director James Whale presents science as a perversion of natural and Christian life, a prevision of death, a tyrant murder of the innocent, a separation of Christina marriage. Dr. Waldman, played by the late Edward Van Sloan, as the only exception, for he is a good man who He sacrifices his life trying to stop the monster.The performances by the now late cast are all very well. Colin Clive's intense performance is great. To see the true depth of his performance, view the scene where Dr. Waldman informs him of his mistake in brain theft. His face is one of up most doubt and concern, which quickly transforms into a face of over confidence. Brilliant. Mae Clarke fills the screen with a presence of vulnerability and innocence. Frederick Kerr adds great helps of humor as Baron Frankenstein, with quirky and wonderfully delivered lines, including his hardened belief that Henry is involved with another woman. Dwight Frye's performance as Henry's sidekick Fritz is eerie and quite a contrast to Colin Clive's proper character. The rest of the cast, including John Boles as Victor Moritz and Edward Van Sloan as Dr. Waldman are all goodThe most notable performance, of course, has to be Boris Karloff as The Monster. Karloff's fame as a horror legend was build on his performance as The Monster. With a lack of dialog(Until the 1935 sequel, Bride of Frankenstein, that is), Karloff is limited in his performance. However, he takes full advantage, offering an array of unforgettable grunts and movements. Juxtaposed with some nifty make up effects(for the time) and director James Whale skill of showing just enough, but not to much, make for an unforgettable screen performance.By juxtaposing Gothic decay and modern science, Whale creates an untrusted and ironic tone, developed further by Arthur Edeson's cinematography and the lyricism of the writing.Wonderfully acted, beautifully filmed and crafted, ironic, thought provoking, and chilling to this day, FRANKENSTEIN remains a horror classic, one not to missed. If not for its ionic stance in film, see it for it's thought provoking themes and simplistic nature.8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"27 June 2006","score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Brilliant.

Many memorable scenes stem directly from the witty dialog.The acting in the film is, of course, amazing. Audrey Hepburn screen debut is the one she received her, regrettably, only Oscar for. But boy did she deserve it. As soon as I start talking about Ms. Hepburn I speak only in hyperbole. Obivously the best actress ever, bar none, Her screen presence, charm and beauty radiate off the screen. Gregory Peck does a pretty good job himself though. He slowly becomes intoxicated with Ms. Hepburn throughout the movie, as I'm sure any man would in a similar situation. Eddie Albert is thrown into the mix for some comic relief and he is quite funny but the movie is really about the two leads.Set in the stunning beauty of Rome this is one of my all-time favorite romantic comedies.

Many memorable scenes stem directly from the witty dialog.The acting in the film is, of course, amazing. Audrey Hepburn screen debut is the one she received her, regrettably, only Oscar for. But boy did she deserve it. As soon as I start talking about Ms. Hepburn I speak only in hyperbole. Obivously the best actress ever, bar none, Her screen presence, charm and beauty radiate off the screen. Gregory Peck does a pretty good job himself though. He slowly becomes intoxicated with Ms. Hepburn throughout the movie, as I'm sure any man would in a similar situation. Eddie Albert is thrown into the mix for some comic relief and he is quite funny but the movie is really about the two leads.Set in the stunning beauty of Rome this is one of my all-time favorite romantic comedies. What a great film. Truly a classic.

The growing popularity of television had whittled the movie going audience to a fraction of what it had been just a decade before, with millions of Americans deciding to stay home and get their visual entertainment for free rather than trek to theaters. As a response, studios began creating epic entertainments, historical epics or biblical stories, filmed in one of many wide screen processes to ensure that what was delivered was more than you could get in your living room. Spartacus is a historical epic of this nature, the story of a slave revolt in the Roman empire led by a man named Spartacus. While many of the trappings of the film are familiar to almost anyone who has seen this type of film, it is unique and thought provoking in many ways, although not quite a masterpiece.Based on a novel by Howard Fast, Spartacus finds our hero a slave since birth working in a Roman camp mining precious metals. He is sold to a gladiatorial training school run by Lentulus Batiatus (Peter Ustinov) where he taught the arts of becoming a gladiator. He also is introduced to women for the first time in his life, specifically slave Verinia (Jean Simmons), but instead of taking her forcefully, Spartacus chooses to treat her like an equal, and this impresses her. After training for some time, Spartacus is one of four gladiators that is selected for a combat to the death to entertain visitors of Batiatus, including powerful Roman Patrician Marcus Crassus (Laurence Olivier). The outcome of the match, and the selling of Verinia to Crassus, enrages Spartacus and the other gladiators who revolt and capture the school. They eventually organize around Spartacus, who convinces them that if they can escape the clutches of the Romans by freeing slaves, forming an army and begin marching to the sea, where they can escape by ship to return to their homelands.With this revolt underway, the Roman Senate attempts to break the slaves by sending various Roman forces against them, but each falls under the might of the freed slaves. At the heart of the Roman opposition are Senator Gracchus (Charles Laughton), who represents the masses, and Crassus, who serves the elite mindset. They each perform maneuvers behind the scenes to either support or hinder Spartacus' campaign, with the final result being the furthering of their own political goals.At the heart of Spartacus is a story of, essentially, class warfare. The Romans are the upper echelon, keeping the mass of slaves under their boot. They treat them without care, using them for both entertainment purposes as gladiators and concubines. The Roman elite are viewed as corrupt and unfeeling towards the human lives they have put into bondage. The slaves are seen as much more noble individuals, fighting for their freedom from the Roman oppression. Unfortunately, the film is much more engaging in it's Roman scenes than in it's slave scenes. The Roman characters are more interesting, their dialogue better written and the various layers of their complicated machinations more enthralling than those of the slaves. We are supposed to root for Spartacus, but his character is left underdeveloped, and his romance with Verinia is not very involving or touching. It is not without some charm, but on the whole proves rather rote. The Romans aren't characters we root for, but when their scenes are on camera, they are at least interesting to watch.Spartacus is well known for it's elaborate spectacle. It's battle scenes, while not as gritty or realistic as ones from more modern epics, are still impressive and grand. The major battles were filmed in Spain with use of the Spanish army, and the mass of individuals used are sight to see. But again, as the slave characters are underdeveloped, it is hard to find yourself really caught up in the action.Aside from it's epic scale, Spartacus is also notable for it's impressive cast. The combined power of British thespians Olivier, Laughton, and Ustinov is a rarity in cinema, and they all perform their parts admirably and provide the most memorable parts of the film. Spartacus was also the first major studio film from director Stanley Kubrick, who had made a few smaller films before Spartacus, but this really catapulted him to the big time. Kubrick would later distance himself from the production, as he did not nurture it from inception but was merely a hired hand (brought in to replace director Anthony Mann), but it is easy to see what would have made the film attractive to him. Kubrick has often made films with a theme of classism at it's heart, and that is the central theme of Spartacus. It is the most accessible film Kubrick has ever made.Spartacus is a decent epic film, with a bit more depth than what you find in most epics, thank's mostly to the scenes involving the machinations of the Romans. If you are interested in the grand scale films of that era, Spartacus is worth viewing.

The problem with his serious-minded approach is that it veers so unpredictably back and forth between soap opera and pure camp that the only consistency is its artifice.

It's definitely the best of the Next Gen movies, and not a bad action flick, but it doesn't really feel like Star Trek to me.There are two parallel stories that play out in First Contact, and sometimes it feels like two separate movies. In Movie A, Picard and the crew of the Enterprise, having traveled to the 21st century in pursuit of a Borg ship, must defend the Enterprise as it is assimilated from within by the evil Borg Queen. It's a lot like Aliens, but without the cussing and acid blood. The corridors of the ship are dark and foreboding, the Borg are unemotional and quite scary, and fighting them seems hopeless. The Borg Queen, however, never really comes across clearly because it's obvious the writers just had no idea what she was supposed to be.Movie A is dark and exciting. Movie B, on the other hand, is light and fluffy, and a little slack. The more comically-oriented members of the crew beam down to 21st century Earth to help Zefram Cochrane repair his groundbreaking warp ship in time for a historic rendezvous with the Vulcans, and have to convince him to become the heroic character he is in the history books. Cochrane is understandably skeptical, not to mention drunk on tequila.The characters on the ground are oblivious to what's going on in space, so the two parallel plots are entirely separated by tone and content. One is dark and serious, the other light and funny. The writers tried too hard to make their movie appeal to everyone, and they end up with a bit of a mish-mash. The comic relief is forced and not very funny, and the action sequences on board ship lose some of their power once you realize how clean they are. After all, there's no blood in the future, and only extras get killed.Picard and Data get the most attention, with a few scenes reserved for Worf and a cameo from Voyager's holographic doctor. The other characters don't contribute much more than background exposition. The show was based solidly on its ensemble cast, so it's a little jarring to have that ensemble reduced to a hero and his sidekick.

Movie B, on the other hand, is light and fluffy, and a little slack. The more comically-oriented members of the crew beam down to 21st century Earth to help Zefram Cochrane repair his groundbreaking warp ship in time for a historic rendezvous with the Vulcans, and have to convince him to become the heroic character he is in the history books. Cochrane is understandably skeptical, not to mention drunk on tequila.The characters on the ground are oblivious to what's going on in space, so the two parallel plots are entirely separated by tone and content. One is dark and serious, the other light and funny. The writers tried too hard to make their movie appeal to everyone, and they end up with a bit of a mish-mash. The comic relief is forced and not very funny, and the action sequences on board ship lose some of their power once you realize how clean they are. After all, there's no blood in the future, and only extras get killed.Picard and Data get the most attention, with a few scenes reserved for Worf and a cameo from Voyager's holographic doctor. The other characters don't contribute much more than background exposition. The show was based solidly on its ensemble cast, so it's a little jarring to have that ensemble reduced to a hero and his sidekick.

It's definitely the best of the Next Gen movies, and not a bad action flick, but it doesn't really feel like Star Trek to me.There are two parallel stories that play out in First Contact, and sometimes it feels like two separate movies. In Movie A, Picard and the crew of the Enterprise, having traveled to the 21st century in pursuit of a Borg ship, must defend the Enterprise as it is assimilated from within by the evil Borg Queen.
