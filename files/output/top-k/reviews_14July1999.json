But, before that, let me say what is good.  The movie has a great and interesting story, and I really loved the way Spike Lee used the camera and cinematography.  It reminded me a lot of Oliver Stone's *U-Turn.*  The acting was also great in this movie.  John Leguizamo, who is most familiar in comedies, gives an outstanding performance filled with reality and depth.  One of my favorite shots in the entire movie that is shown several times, shows Leguizamo\/Vinnie hanging around with his friends.  They hang out at the end of this tier-like area with a large, yellow sign that says Dead End.  A couple of times, the camera focuses on this sign, and I believe Spike Lee is making a point here.  These people seem to be at a very realy dead end in their own lives and they are looking and grasping desperately for anything to fulfill this void.  And when the.44 Caliber\/Son of Sam serial killings start up again, along with the raging temperatures, this only adds to their situation. This is made most evident with Vinnie, the movies main character.  As the killing continue, they have a drastic effect on him, that eventually leave him a broken man with nothing left.  For those who think this movie focuses on the killings of David Berkowitz, you're wrong.  The movies proposed focus is on how those killings affected the people around them.  Vinnie also seems to be somewhat of a parallel character to Berkowitz.  While Berkowitz follows the voices in his head to carry out his malicous deeds, we see as Vinnie is ultimately controlled by those around him, his fool friends, who are constantly tormenting him and are the ones who finally take him to his lowest level of despair by betraying\/killing a friend, so to speak. Finally, one other interesting little bit, in the scenes that show Berkowitz, he often spells things out with blocks, a very interesting concept by Lee.  When he does this, the letter L is often replaced by an upside down 7.  The number 7 is considered to be the number of God, and this adds to the overall overtone of evil that surrounds Berkowitz. But this movie has one flaw that quite ruined it for me.  Like carrying around excess baggage, the movie is loaded with almost a whole other sub-plot on the sex life of Vinnie.  Why?  Grant it, a few of the scenes help develop the desperation of character that Vinnie is, but is all of it really necessary?  There's a whole orgy scene that really served no purpose whatsoever othen than to bring conflict between Vinnie and his wife, which could already be seen anyway, and could have been made evident in some other manner.  I think Spike Lee had a really interesting story and great concept for a movie, but I am confused as to why he let such a good thing be ruined by something that was not at all neseccary for the plot of the movie.  It should have kept its focus on the Son of Sam killings and how they affected humanity, not the sex life of Vinnie.

It is, in my opinion, about equal to Return of the Jedi, but not as good as A New Hope or The Empire Strikes Back.  I think that this is a film that we will learn to appreciate a great deal more after we see Episodes II and III.  Right now we are viewing the film alone, which is really unfair.  This is really just a set up movie.  A set up movie obviously can not be as interesting as it's predecessors.  If you read a good book it's first chapters are not as interesting as the middle chapters. When I head about the prequel trilogy I was not expecting to be guessing what would happen next, after all, I knew how it would turn out.  How wrong I was.  I now find myself wondering how things will happen, even more so than I did with the original trilogy.  How will Anakin turn to the dark side?  How will Amidala die?  Why did Obi-Wan and Yoda disappear, but not Qui-Gon? Although the relationships were not developed in this film as much as they were in the others, I feel that this will be further developed in the future films.  I thought that the four main actors did a fantastic job. When I first heard that Ewan McGregor was going to play young Obi-Wan I'll admit, I had my doubts.  They were all put to rest when I saw and heard him on screen.  He sounded almost identical to Sir Alec Guinness in Star Wars. Natalie Portman played a double role extremely well.  She brought a very human touch to Padme, and a very regal feel to Queen Amidala.  Liam Neeson played a rebellious Jedi Master well.  And Jake Loyd, contrary to what early rumors said (Mannequin Skywalker),played a very good young Darth Vader. The actor appeared very innocent, which will make his turn to the dark side even more powerful.  There are a few hints at his future fate though, like his hard glares at Mace Windu in the Jedi Council. As for the much debated comic relief character, Jar Jar Binks, he is not a racist stereotype.  I firmly believe that Lucas had no bad intentions while creating the character.  If anyone sees the character as racist, they are going in with a pre-conceived racist view.  I think the character, whom many regard as annoying, had a potential for disaster.  However, he was handled very tactfully.  The action never centered around Jar Jar's comic actions.  A prime example of this is when Jar Jar is juggling the pit droids.  Instead of making a big deal of this Qui-Gon simply keeps walking and says Come on, we're going. In all, I'd say that this is a very good installment into the Star Wars universe and worthy of the Star Wars name.  The action is great, and the movie keeps you on the edge of your seat.  The podrace and the jedi duel is amazing.  Although the lightsaber duel is not as emotional as the ones in the original trilogy, it is the best physical battle of all the Star Wars films.  John William's score is fantastic.  This is a very good film that does what a good film is supposed to do, keep you guessing.  You will find yourself, a few days later asking yourself, I wonder how Anakin will turn to the dark side?  Will his mother be killed?  Will Amidala leave him?  I can't wait for Episode II.

The images of the women suffering as they watch their men go off to sea are utterly devastating, they hold so much emotional depth, so much beauty.

Anyway, this was shown (like 'the Mummy' last week) as the weekly 'Sneak Preview' at the City Cinema, Amsterdam. Had I known what it was going to be beforehand I would not have gone, because though I recall enjoying it when I saw it last year at the Streatham ABC, it is really not a film that demands or requires a second viewing. Director Peter Howitt (Joey from the appalling 80's UK sitcom'Bread') has pitched this film squarely at the transatlantic market, presenting a lightweight and unchallenging comedy in the vein of 'Four Weddings', or this year's more interesting (to my mind) 'Notting Hill'. Like the latter of these films, 'Sliding Doors' comedy resides more in individual situations than especially clever writing or dialogue. The scene in which James (John Hannah) entertains his friends around the restaurant table is an exemplary case in point. Rather than writing any good lines into the script itself, James instead quotes freely from Monty Python (whose 'Spanish Inquisition' sketch is referenced throughout with no apparent dramatic, comedic or didactic rationale other than that of recycling already familiar material for a broader international audience). The film's entertainment value derives from the fact that the two disparate narratives involving Paltrow's alternate futures are so densely plotted that the film never really gets the chance to flag. That said, neither story really carries any weight of its own. The dual narratives are merely a gimmick, a structural device similarly used by Kieslowski in 'La Double Vie de Veronique'. Here the plotting almost appears random, with nothing in the way of subtext, allegory or explanation, so one can never wholly feel involved by either strand, merely distracted.This may explain why the denouement is so unsatisfactory. The film never really goes anywhere because it has nowhere to go. What we have here are two half-baked romantic shorts whose narratives are entirely unrelated save for the tenuous 'what if' upon which the film's foundations are built. It's not an unentertaining film with some chuckles and gentle romance provided along the way, but it comes across as rather forced and lacks the weight and the context of more recent commercially pitched Brit-coms (the two Hugh Grant vehicles, for example, or the sublime 'This Years Love'). Ultimately, 'Sliding Doors' is little more than a superficial diversion, which took off in Britain last year due to the serious lack of box office competition during the World Cup.

Had I known what it was going to be beforehand I would not have gone, because though I recall enjoying it when I saw it last year at the Streatham ABC, it is really not a film that demands or requires a second viewing. Director Peter Howitt (Joey from the appalling 80's UK sitcom'Bread') has pitched this film squarely at the transatlantic market, presenting a lightweight and unchallenging comedy in the vein of 'Four Weddings', or this year's more interesting (to my mind) 'Notting Hill'. Like the latter of these films, 'Sliding Doors' comedy resides more in individual situations than especially clever writing or dialogue. The scene in which James (John Hannah) entertains his friends around the restaurant table is an exemplary case in point. Rather than writing any good lines into the script itself, James instead quotes freely from Monty Python (whose 'Spanish Inquisition' sketch is referenced throughout with no apparent dramatic, comedic or didactic rationale other than that of recycling already familiar material for a broader international audience).
