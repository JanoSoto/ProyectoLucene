If you think about it, he's also an unlikely choice in some ways. Is the movie entertaining? It is when he is not at the adult video store or around the bad guys (or anyone who seems like they might be). Joauquin Phoneix's character isn't very interesting. Basically, the movie meanders and the sequence where the bad guys are beating Cage up isn't particularly convincing or interesting. Oh, and in a strange twist (if you want to call it that), turns out the man who gave Cage this assignment is not a nice man after all. The movie gets off to a great start and holds your attention for a while, but the more we are told about the case, the less we care.**1\/2 out of **** ","genre":null},{"date":"8 April 2011","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Nicolas Cage plays an unlucky detective who is assigned to do some dirty work.
