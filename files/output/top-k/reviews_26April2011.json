For a film that depicts its characters breaking all the rules, we will ignore this statute and delve into a world where punching someone in the face is considered a favor and nothing is as it seems. Released in 1999 by director by David Fincher, Fight Club is a film adaptation by the novel of the same name, written by Chuck Palahniuk. Having read this novel, it is not very often I get to say, the movie is much better than the book, due primarily to the superb acting and interesting cinematic techniques, which completely, yet pleasantly, surprised me. With a heavyweight class including Edward Norton (American History X, 25th Hour), Brad Pitt (Se7en, Inglorious Basterds) and Helena Bonham Carter (The King's Speech, Big Fish), Fight Club is sure to deliver a lethal unexpected right hook sure to knock you on your ass.The film focuses on two men, an uptight insomniac yuppie (Norton) trying to hit rock bottom in life and a carefree soap salesman named Tyler Durden (Pitt), who attempts to make Norton's character reevaluate his values and priorities. Through a new form a therapy that includes viscously brawling with strangers, the values of our society are addressed. Eventually this testosterone-fueled violent therapy evolves into something truly sinister yet celebrated amongst this underground men's club. This whole plot is tied together by the relationship between the two main characters, their opposing views on a unique woman in their life, Marla (Bonham Carter), and the disintegration of a once-promising life.If you think that this movie is simply another senseless violent movie like Fighting or any other teen angst movie where the main star has to fight a bully for a better life, I urge you to think again. Unique cinematographic techniques and at times a nonlinear story line, part of the original Palahniuk novel, it leaves the viewer somewhat disoriented and detached from reality, which ties in perfectly with the feelings of the characters. Addressing the state of the United States, and most industrialized nations, in its consumerist state, far past the necessary components of life, the film makes the viewer ask themselves what they truly need in life instead of What sort of dining set defines me as a person? The film satirizes the world of consumers and culminates with a big bang, fittingly set to the song Where is My Mind by the Pixies, sure to leave viewers awestruck. This idea of consumerism taking over is something that most, if not all, of us can relate to.I would not recommend this movie to anyone with self-esteem issues, which repeatedly informs the Fight Club participants, as well as the viewer that they are not a special unique snowflake. That, paired with images of Brad Pitt fighting shirtless is enough to make any self-respecting person's positive self-regard waver. Also if anyone is a fan of Martha Stewart steer clear because let's just say Tyler Durden does not think too highly of her, and lets the viewer know this in a scene with some very colorful language. The film is rated R, because of scenes like this, for disturbing and graphic depiction of violent anti-social behavior, sexuality and language. There is possibly no better way to summarize the film more quickly than the rating of violent anti social behavior. The film is filled with ultra-violent realistic fight scenes; though they are very bloody at times, they serve a purpose and propel the story forward, instead of other films in similar categories where the idea of the film is simply violence for violence's sake. This film is something much more than that.For those who have never been in a fight, those who do not want to die without any scars or anyone who has recently developed insomnia based upon an unfulfilled lifestyle dedicated to collecting various consumer goods, I truly recommend this film. A fast paced film that hits you and hits you nonstop and does not quit until the end when you are forced to tap out, question your beliefs and values and, experience premature enlightenment, Fight Club is a truly remarkable and unique film. The film can change your entire idea about the life you lead. It makes you question yourself and more specifically who, if given the option, you would fight. Gandhi, Lincoln, William Shatner; in the world of Fight Club everyone is a potential opponent and nothing is out of bounds, so long as there are no shoes and no shirts.

","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"26 April 2011","score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" I'm not sure why I'm reviewing this. Probably to give myself something to do. I remember the hype injected into this film, and then seeing it years later on a bargain bin VHS copy that sold for like $5 or something, all I can say is I'm glad I waited for it to hit the home video market.The basic plot is about some man suffering from psychosis and wanting to get back into the proverbial mental hospital where all of his whims and desires can be fulfilled. The antagonist, Dr. Soran, is a maniac who's got his mittens on a rocket that will bring about an energy ribbon that will bring him back into his once much loved nirvana. Said nirvana is a manifestation where all of his desires can come true at the conjuring of a thought. Hey, who wouldn't want that? But, thanks to Kirk, we discover that Nirvana, specifically Dr. Soran's version, is not all it's cracked up to be.It's a unique film in that we have a sliver of the original 1960's cast meeting with the TNG+ era cast of the late 80s, 90s and beyond. It's also oddly fitting (and no doubt intentional) in that the original show addressed psychological and behavior social issues plaguing society, and offered possible solutions, or at least causes thereof, finally meets the TNG people who do the same, but (unlike the original 1960's show) did so without any regard to an overarching societal norm. This made TNG one of the most pretentious, awful and valueless shows imaginable. But, both had their agendas for the TV viewing and theatre going public. One was an earlier iteration of the other, and it was inevitable that they should meet on the big screen.But the result itself is fairly dismissive of the original show. There's a kind of we're not cowboys anymore, so let this be your last battlefield kind of mentality that not just underscores the film, but is in fact in your face. The epitome of this comes with the famous scene near the end, and Picard's supposed deep reflection on mankind's past. The symbolism is that Picard's generation of space travellers is more rounded, robust, educated and emotionally blue printed than the warrior explorer of yore; i.e. Captain Kirk. Do you believe it? Well, you might look around at the world today and see how things have changed. But then you might question whether those changes were to your actual benefit, or whether they were made to avoid a large catastrophe for which you were not consulted. How much do you believe in fighting and bringing in others for that fight for what you believe is right? That's kind of the theme here.Dr. Soran is a manifestation of that, but represents the path of insanity, while Kirk represents the old ways. And for all of the struggles, confrontations, maneuvering and actual fighting that goes on, it is not Picard's generation that wins the day for the United Federation of Planets. And for all of that we are treated to a scene of him giving deep contemplation to a legendary figure at the end?Huh.In short the film is supposed to be a transition from old Trek with action to new alleged cerebral Trek with high ideals and better methods of dealing with miscreants like Dr. Soran. If you believe in that, then this film is for you.Me, well, those of you who've read my previous reviews and posts on other matters, know my views on the Next Generation of Trek, and they are echoed in this review. Even Shatner knew that there was something just not sitting right with this installment of the franchise, and it could be part of the reason why more of the cast of the first show was not involved in this production (probably wishful thinking on my part). The technical aspects of the film hit all their marks. No one save for Shatner himself really gives a lackluster performance. And again the only reason Shatner didn't give us the usual Kirk we've come to know and love is because he probably didn't agree with the script and overall message of the film. Kudos to him.The plot and story, to my way of thinking, had potential, but the execution seemed to put the basic plot behind the transition theme of old and new Treks. That is to say Dr. Soran and his ambitions almost felt like an afterthought. Almost like they were tacked on at the end, and were taking second billing to the Kirk-Picard thing. Had Dr. Soran and his scheming been the focus of the film, then everything else, in my opinion, would have fallen into place. Otherwise this film really missed its mark.Which is all the more puzzling of why more Trek-fans really gave this installment high marks. Again the love of a scientist and his theory rears its head with the sterling reviews that are less than objective. But, then again this is the IMDb.Not a good film, but I have to be honest, not really a horrible film in spite of its utter trampling of historic values of mankind. Take it for what it's worth, but don't say I didn't warn you.

An underlying philosophy is that of control (leverage), one element of the writings that this is derived from.What happens is the humans eventually bond together and compete (fight back against the bad guys) to achieve a common future with benefit for all mankind (or what's left of it).But they also use nuclear weapons (an apparent evil) and are ultimately protected by radioactivity and then gold (the basis of our monetarist ways) is the key to their rise. Elements of our current society that are so often criticised by those on the outside.After seeing this for the second time all (most) the way through I am beginning to warm to it. Yes it's poor but it also has some symbolism and is not that much worse than many other films I have seen. ","genre":"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"}]
