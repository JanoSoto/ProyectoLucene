It's almost as good as American Werewolf in London. It's fun, has sharp dialogue and constant wolf references (a copy of the book Howl is seen on a desk; people watch The Big Bad Wolf and The Wolf Man on TV). Also The Colony itself is just gorgeous and beautifully atmospheric. In the day it's clear and bright--at night the fog rolls in and it becomes really creepy.

It's ALMOST a classic.The problems are many, but the main one is that the film isn't scary--when you see the werewolves they look pretty pathetic. This is supposed to be (partially) a HORROR film--it doesn't help when the main monsters look silly. The transformation scenes look lousy too--but this was over 20 years ago. The story is sort of vague (why does Dr. Waggner invite her to the colony in the first place? It puts her in danger!) and there are plenty of dead spots. It seems too long and it's only 90 minutes! Also Wallace and Stone are not good actors--Wallace's reaction to finding a dead, bloody body is very poor and Stone sleepwalks through his role (although he does very well at a campfire sequence--you'll know it when you see it).So, it has great atmosphere, some very good laughs, John Carradine and some very good cameos (Dick Miller, Roger Corman and Forrest J. Ackerman holding a copy of his magazine Famous Monsters of Filmland) but it's VERY light and insubstantial--you want to see a real movie after this.

Turns out I was right.Jay Chandrasekhar (credited not only as writer\/director, but also playing one of the main characters) and his ragtag team of pseudo-heroes churn out a film that isn't hoping to be regarded by the Academy as the Best Movie of the year, nor is it trying to force upon us a political or religious statement.But what it IS trying to do is make us laugh, and with such scenes as a police unit fighting a ferocious pig guarding a Winnebago with a dead woman inside and a cop attacking the punk at the burger hut who spit in his burger, it succeeds.  Without comparing it to classic humourous powerhouses like Animal House, Caddyshack and the like, Super Troopers definitely stands on its own and delivers the goods.  Some may not appreciate the humour, as it does border on the offensive, however the characters come across as loveable despite their villainous status.Take, for example, Thorny (Jay Chandrasekhar).  In the opening scene, viewers will quickly love the three stoners who get pulled over and in order to rid themselves of the evidence, the kid in the backseat must eat a whole bag of marijuana and another of hallucinogenic mushrooms.  When Thorny pulls these kids over, the viewers' first instinct is to brand him the bad guy. But not moments later, he engages himself in an argument with the youngsters in which he takes THEIR SIDE and still manages to come out on top.  This not only proves his authority in any situation, but also displays a classic example of why this film has attained a somewhat cult status in such a short amount of box office time.The plot of the story, while defined, is very loose and comes across as clumsy at times.  But with such a diverse cast who each have their own subplots, it's to be expected.  There are always numerous scenarios happening at any given moment, many of them offering opportunities for uproarious laughter.

The only complains I have about this movie is that it is often slow, and a little confusing at the beginning. It's not a completely perfect movie, but it's definitely a masterpiece of holocaust movies. All the schools that show kids Life Is Beautiful should definitely switch to this.

The cinematography in this film is simply amazing, in fact i'd say some of the best cinematography i've ever seen, but despite it's technical excellence, SPR is a pathetic, manipulative attempt by Speilberg to make him feel better about himself. The only character development in the movie takes place in the scenes before that particular character's death, it's happens in EVERY case; it's like clockwork. The ending is absolutely horrendously manipulative, and in fact the whole story doesn't really make sense as a result of it. SPOILER ALERT - don't read any farther if ya don't want to ruin the flick for yourself. At the beginning we have the shot of that old man at the grave, then it closes in on him and his memory begins of what happened... the only thing is that we find out the old man is really Ryan, not Tom Hank's Character, so i'm wondering how Ryan has all these memories of the beaches and the rest of the movie. Theoretically shouldn't the 'memories' start when Ryan enters the movie? Oh well, I can see arguments against my point, but the use of some certain camera angles REALLY makes the point of saying that the old man is Tom Hanks. I found this movie, above all things (even manipulative) to be extremely boring. Here's another case of a movie that had a about a 12 minute story stretched out to infinity. There are hundreds of little things that made me laugh about this movie in the wrong way, and obviously I won't go into all of them but I do feel this movie makes the German Armies look rediculous, specifically in the tank scene.

Other humorous moments include Tom Hanks diffusing a potentially hostile situation by telling everybody that hes a school teacher and the weak,poetry loving-'i've never shot anybody'- soldier killing a guy for no real reason in the situation.

I use the word still, but to be honest, I only saw the film really for the first time today (I got the Director's cut DVD today for my birthday), so I have no idea what people though of it when it first came out, I know it must have been big business as it necessitated two crap sequels and two TV spin offs (one animated, one live action).  I also remember the kids at my high school talking about it every time it was show on television the night before, I was once lucky enough to see one of those screenings, but sadly for me, it was edited for TV.  Which made watching Verhoeven's gore splattered director's cut toady a real eye opening experience.  Where as in the TV version, say for example Murphy's (Peter Weller) death scene, we saw some guns go off, heard a couple of comedic one-liners, then wee saw a body hit the floor.  So, for the rest of the film, we had no idea what kind of agony Murphy went through, so therefore, we are unable to feel enough of a connection with him to get more out of the film.  But seeing the character of Murphy destroyed by shotgun blast in the un-cut version, his limbs torn from his body, the laughs and now menacing one-liners, only made Robocop's struggle all the more moving as the film reached it's third act.That's always been my problem with the censor board, they are all to willing to have guns, being fired and people being killed, but we're not allowed to see the actual effect that a gun can do to a human body.  So we get films like the Matrix, in which fifty people are killed (by the hero I might add) being deemed suitable for young teenagers, and that's fine, as long as we don't see the consequences of a violent act.  Then, conversely we can have a film like Natural Born Killers, which was held back from distribution and brought-up all kinds of political debates, as to whether or not the film was dangerous, all because Oliver Stone was brave enough to show the effect that violent crimes have on people, maybe if he didn't do the greatest job with said material, he was still persecuted for a film in which, although about killers, had less people killed than in the Matrix.  And this is a problem that has followed Verhoeven throughout his career.  Admittedly, sometimes the violence in his films can be exploitative, like for example Star-ship Troopers, but in Robocop the violence is completely justified, as it's from that unforgiving violent act that the story is developed.Judging from Robocop, they should really let euro art-house directors make Hollywood blockbusters more often.  Paul Verhoeven, then better know for his Dutch art films Turkish Delight, Soldier of Orange and The 4th Man, not only heightens the dramatic impact of the characters, but also the harsh social critique directed at America.  The film not only looks at the problems with capitalization if big business, the privatisation of the police force, and the growing consciousness of the mass media, it also has a strong message about the triumph of the soul.

I like films that get by on their own merits  - not by just having big name actors mug and wink at each other - which is why `Harold and Maude' is a better love story than `Sleepless in Seattle' and `Notting Hill' and their nauseating ilk will ever be! I just like films - period - I also write screenplays and novels too, it doesn't make me any more qualified mind - I'm just a big fan of cinema and the medium of film as both an art form and an entertainment media.In fact the only films I dislike are the patronising formulaic studio crap - sequels, Julia Roberts\/ Demi Moore vehicles etc. mindless action films, unless they have originality or personality, (like Jackie Chan for example - I can forgive him anything as he's fantastic) and Lost Highways staunchly anti-commercial, anti-narrative, hypnotic and hectic collusion of images and scenes, the dreamlike storyline that atrophies into a disturbing, insane loop, makes it a contender for my film of the year!  - Or at least the film that I like seemingly just to confound my friend's as they never get them and think I am deliberately doing it to be highbrow!If you can relate to my tastes then you'll probably like it - if you enjoyed the uneccessary Planet of the apes remake\/ debacle\/ reinterpretation, then you'll find this very heavy going!What you get with Lost Highway is an open-ended narrative that deliberately explains nothing and blurs both the accepted cinematic rules and visual vocabulary of what we expect in modern movies. It's a free form, lazy, almost easy-going nightmare that glides hauntingly and quietly from one surreal scene to the next - some are simply gripping in their intensity, others alienating in their sparse, Pinter-esque dialogues. Characters are dispassionate, guarded creatures that show little emotion, and the sinister Mystery man in black, comes across as the most interesting, but is also sadly afforded the least screen time.Overall - if you watch this film expecting to follow a story and passively allow the visuals to narrate to you, then you'll be disappointed - and big time! But if you are tired of knowing what is going to happen next when you watch a film, and are sick of the sight of the same few industry assholes getting paid millions, and confusing their pay-checks with their talent, then watch this dangerous and unpredictable masterpiece of the surreal and enjoy it as a unique piece of visual artistry.It's not Lynch's best  - I'm a big fan of Blue Velvet and Wild At Heart (although I do find some parts hard to take!) But he's undeniably an intriguing intelligent filmmaker, and worthy of support. There maybe difficult moments where you may lose the thread, but it's worthy of perseverance if you are interested in expanding your movie-going tastes.It's not perfect - perhaps only Halloween and Star Wars are the only true ideals in capturing their respective genres and remaining unequalled masterpieces - You do have to invest an amount of attention to enjoy this film, and even use your brain while you watch it, but it's a hell of a lot better way to spend a winters evening than watching something like pearl bloody habroror, or whatever.I can honestly say that, now after seeing the film, I can understand why there was nothing in the way of a description or a synopsis on the back of the video box!7\/10 Unique, flawed, disjointed, confusing, unsettling, disturbing - Great.

This was not an action movie, it was a farce, if not full satire.  The hard-rock music playing in the car, for instance, turns out be Arnold just playing music on his car stereo.  His overuse of Jack Slater's trademark line Big Mistake and his clear force of I'll Be Back poke fun at his longtime association with the phrase I'll Be Back as well as Trust Me and the Terminator 2 exclusive Hasta La Vista, Baby.  One error was the fact that the movie was supposedly the fourth in the Jack Slater series, though Arnold has never even a third of any movie.  He has always stopped at sequels.  However, that will change if Terminator 3 happens, which looks to be potentially devastating to Arnold's suddenly fragile career.  This movie entertained me, but it really damaged Arnold's image.  Also, when the actual Arnold interacted with Jack, it made Arnold look like a jerk.  His stock fell far after this film, as it was at probably an all-time high after Terminator 2. This movie turned his career into a joke, and combined with the ill-advised Junior, turned him into a novelty act.  People automatically hate his more recent work, such as Collateral Damage, when they would have loved it had it come out 10 years earlier.  That said, I do not dislike this movie, I enjoyed it, and would recommend it to anyone who wants to watch a light action-comedy.  F.

Unfortunately, the cleverness made most people miss it, thinking it was, you guessed it, poor writing and direction.  Its unfortunate that this movie caused the problems it did, for Arnold, and for the Arnold fan, namely me.
