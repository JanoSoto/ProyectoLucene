The wit and humor were quite obvious to me, though I can see why it would offend Americans, who have no sense of humor about themselves what-so-ever. It is true that this film has been well-received throughout Europe, from what I have seen in any case. Especially in France, where it still plays occasionally. Of course the sex was ludicrous and tacky. I found this to be quite intentional! The writing is bad only in the sense that it seems to be a parody of shows like Baywatch. Joe Ezsterhaus is a bad writer, but only a director with the wit of Verhoeven seems to have been able to make a true success of his tacky, obvious words, by turning them on their collective ear with his over-the-top direction, just as he did in Basic Instinct. I believe the latter film was more successful in America because it was not about people you might meet on the street (or in a movie theatre). Rather, it concerned a privileged class which most Americans regard with suspicion anyway. It's true, films like this don't come along very often--And it's a shame. Mr. Verhoeven is quite a brave man to attack American decadence and stupidity right in its own backyard.

Like so many banned films, one had to watch it to see why it had been so maligned.I was not so shocked at the violence or blood, in fact the latter was not so realistic looking. The only guy I felt sad about was the poor cop who was captured and tortured by Mr Blonde. He was doomed from the start.  The film had the usual messages about friendship, trust, comradeship and all the human non-virtues. In an unexpected way the violence and evil help to make portray them more vividly.  Films of this sort do not make society a better place or really provide entertainment but occasionally we need them to drag us from the cosiness of our living rooms to the realities of criminal life on the streets of our cities.

It's happy to meander through one of the most intense times of the twentieth century, and for the most part fails to summon up much passion -- positive or negative.If the story is pointless, the focus on the characters is, for better or worse, much sharper. The main character is Luca (Baird Wallace), a semi-autobiographical figure for Zeffirelli. The illegitimate son of a vain, promiscuous businessman, Luca is befriended by a group of haughty English ladies whilst growing up in Florence in the 1930s and 40s. When World War Two breaks out, all stay in Italy -- some unable to leave, but the leader of the pack simply steadfast in a nonsensical determination that because she once drank tea with Mussolini, and her husband was a diplomat, no harm can come to any elderly Englishwomen.Upstaging the action at every turn is beautiful photography by David Watkin (Out of Africa), and good period re-creation, in the authentic costume design and well-chosen locations. Most of the time, that action isn't bad, merely uninteresting. If the film -- sunny and innocuous -- were intended as comedy, maybe I would have enjoyed it more, but in the way it's made, and at the pace to which the story unfolds, it comes across as a static drama with infrequent, spasmodic flashes of wit.The wit sometimes works -- the best moment in the film comes when a character sees a Knickerbocker Glory, only to say of Americans It's amazing... they can even vulgarise ice cream! The early drama plays well, too, with touching illustration of Luca's hard times as a child. Occasionally, however, I became very annoyed. Zeffirelli's deception and narcissism has real gall, in that a key plot point is Luca's active participation in the resistance movement, when the real Zeffirelli was never involved in any such thing. Nor did I particularly care for the old dears. Mary, the woman who takes young Luca under her wing, is written with depth and kindness, but played as weirdly and annoyingly as possible by Joan Plowright, who ruins yet another good role. Judi Dench's character is a mad scruff, whose short, quiet moments are always followed up by interminable fits of hysterical crying. Lady Hester (Maggie Smith) is a character of such idiocy and arrogance that I view her as simply evil.Outside this circle is a more refreshing female presence, flamboyant American playgirl Esta, portrayed in Oscar-worthy fashion by Cher. But she too is surrounded by irritating morons. One is a crass layabout, Georgie (Lily Tomlin), whose lesbianism is constantly being pointed out for no reason, and who dresses like no real human being I've ever seen. Another, the ineptly conceived reporter Connie (Tessa Pritchard), is a walking bag of ridiculous clichés from 30s screwball comedies.Most of these women are morally bankrupt snobs oblivious to their surroundings, and this is shown without apology. When the biddies cook up a storm at having to share a house together, or at enemy soldiers not saying Goodnight, ladies, the film seems to be on their side, unaware of the ludicrous audacity. This becomes most sickening when brave British soldiers travel from the front line to valiantly offer the women a safe haven, and are met with bitchy impudence. Some members of the audience laughed with pride -- I sank in my seat and thought how grateful the poor young lads in Saving Private Ryan would have been for such an offer.So unlike Chariots of Fire, which got me emotionally involved with people I'd normally run a mile from, Tea With Mussolini fails to humanise its priggish characters. And unlike the recent Oscar-winner Life is Beautiful, Zeffirelli's film does not carry much power in showing how spirits can be kept up even when the world seems to collapse. I'm aware that there are people like this. I don't want to spend two hours watching them.
