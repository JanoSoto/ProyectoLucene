And he nearly always chooses his victims at random, killing with no significant motive.  Think about it--you could be murdered tomorrow for no good reason by someone you've never even met.

Jack Nicholson, as the cop, is tormented by the brutal crime, and becomes obsessed with honoring his pledge. The setup and atmosphere of this drama is effective and haunting, but ultimately the story walks an uneven path to its unsatisfying conclusion.One of the first problems with the film is the very opening scene, which, it becomes obvious within minutes, is actually a scene from much later in the movie. That means the audience is given a hint as to the outcome of the story just after the movie houselights go down. And the hint is HUGE. Unlike the beginnings of SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, and THE GLADIATOR, which used the same foreshadowing method, the scene chosen to begin THE PLEDGE is as subtle as a smack on the head with a shovel.Already knowing which direction Jack Nicholson's character will be heading, the fascination for the audience is to see how he reaches that point. The range that Nicholson shows will not disappoint. From the horror he feels at the scene of the crime, to his compassion for the grieving parents, to the paranoia that makes it difficult for him to keep a grip on reality--Nicholson sells those emotions like few actors can. That being said, his journey toward instability seems to be a plot contrivance. Nothing in his history, as far as we are told, makes his downturn seem like a logical progression of his life. He's seen countless brutal crimes in his long career, presumably, and there's no mention or feeling given that he's carrying a lot of baggage from those experiences. The pledge itself seemed to flip a switch, but for me to buy that I needed more background on his character. We got his retirement party to start the movie and no flashbacks,no conversations about past events, no nothing to give us a sense of this guy's life up to then.Given this, I found the ending unnecessarily cruel. If you watch this movie as a character study, and as an another example of Jack Nicholson's considerable talent, you will be rewarded. If you make an emotional investment in this movie, prepare to feel cheated.

(You can almost feel the undefined sadness that's within BRUCE WILLIS' character). And like THE SIXTH SENSE the only person he seems to be in deep emotional contact is a boy. His son Joseph (SPENCER TREAT CLARK) loves and adores him despite the fact that even he get rejected (and kept on a distance) by his father wheras the boy's love and admiration seems boundless. His marriage isn't doing well either. Dunne and his wife (ROBIN WRIGHT PENN) live in separate bedrooms, they seem very sad througout the movie, sad but unfortunately still in love and neither capable to recognise or name their problems nor to handle them! A divorce seems inevitable.Like THE SIXTH SENSE the film has some kind of a `mentor' from outside the family. Meet Elijah Price (SAMUEL L JACKSON). This `mentor' seems to know more about Dunne than Dunne would have known or suspected about himself. After surviving a horrible train crash killing everybody on the train but David Dunne (who survived the crash unharmed) Elijah starts tutoring his unwilling and rejecting new `student' Dunne about the unavoidable truth David is one kind of a very special species of men their bones don't break, they don't suffer any illnesses, and their existence have a special purpose they are meant to do good deeds, being heroic, fight injustice, or put into one sentence David Dunne is destined to be a genuine super hero!Like THE SIXTH SENSE the lead character is unwilling to accept his new position and purpose in his life. He fights and rejects it deeply, and he needs help from others to open his mind and to accept the unavoidable.Like THE SIXTH SENSE it is the path leading David on his inner quest that is important part about the movie (not the destination itself). His quest examines elementary issues like destiny and one's use in life, and the film avoids giving answers but leaves the viewer alone with his thoughts (even if you are not religious it makes you think and probably reconsider a few things).But the thing that makes UNBREAKABLE truly great is not necessarily the story itself but how the story is told by director M NIGHT SHYAMALAN. His style offers some virtues in directing which seemed to be long lost!! SHYAMALAN likes to use long angles without any editing at all allowing us to watch the characters becoming real-life persons - and we are allowed to look at them and watch them as they are working things out, questioning themselves, struggling with the situation they are in. It also makes you appreciating the work of the actors involved even more. You can almost feel these people and you really start caring about them. It gives you the feeling of some sort of documentary of real people and real emotions. Well this only could work because The acting is marvellous as well (as it is in every SHYAMALAN film)! BRUCE WILLIS has never been better, he is a genuine character actor trapped in the body of an action star! And SAMUEL L JACKSON is always brilliant. He was able to shine in every single role he had done previously, no matter how dull or stupid his part was - fortunately these times are over, this movie is the prove (Give this man a life sized oscar, why don't you!). ROBIN WRIGHT PENN is great as well. Although her part doesn't give her much to do really, her understated performance fit in so perfectly and works without any signs of vanity and mannerism that you have to adore her for her professionalism which makes her a truly great actress - especially if you think of the high rank of UNBREAKABLE from the very beginning! SPENCER TREAT CLARK did an equally good job playing David Dunne's son Joseph. His performance is as good as JOSEPH CROSS was in WIDE AWAKE or HALEY JOEL OSMENT in THE SIXTH SENSE and all the other kids playing in M NIGHT SHYAMALAN's films.I think one of the reasons that made THE SIXTH SENSE a huge hit was the editing of the movie The editor of the film ANDREW MONDSHEIN did a great but more conventional job, making THE SIXTH SENSE faster in the terms of storytelling while UNBREAKABLE was edited by P. T. Anderson's editor DYLAN TICHENOR. His approach to films is lot more arthouse-like (but brilliant though). His low paced editing is much harder to find in the blockbuster movies of Hollywood. Since his style of editing is quite unfamiliar to the mass audiences which is certainly not used to concentrating on one angle alone for an entire scene I am not surprised that some movie goers consider this movie pretentious and even boring! I think that TICHENOR's editing fit in perfectly with SHYAMALAN's story telling (and is Oscar worthy), but Night should probably consider to reunite with ANDREW MONDHEIN who is clearly an editing genius in his own terms. His work gave THE SIXTH SENSE a little more `ooomph', and he as an editor is just as brilliant as SHYAMALAN is as a director and their styles match perfectly.Please, Night, do another one soon.

Dunne and his wife (ROBIN WRIGHT PENN) live in separate bedrooms, they seem very sad througout the movie, sad but unfortunately still in love and neither capable to recognise or name their problems nor to handle them! A divorce seems inevitable.Like THE SIXTH SENSE the film has some kind of a `mentor' from outside the family. Meet Elijah Price (SAMUEL L JACKSON). This `mentor' seems to know more about Dunne than Dunne would have known or suspected about himself. After surviving a horrible train crash killing everybody on the train but David Dunne (who survived the crash unharmed) Elijah starts tutoring his unwilling and rejecting new `student' Dunne about the unavoidable truth David is one kind of a very special species of men their bones don't break, they don't suffer any illnesses, and their existence have a special purpose they are meant to do good deeds, being heroic, fight injustice, or put into one sentence David Dunne is destined to be a genuine super hero!Like THE SIXTH SENSE the lead character is unwilling to accept his new position and purpose in his life. He fights and rejects it deeply, and he needs help from others to open his mind and to accept the unavoidable.Like THE SIXTH SENSE it is the path leading David on his inner quest that is important part about the movie (not the destination itself). His quest examines elementary issues like destiny and one's use in life, and the film avoids giving answers but leaves the viewer alone with his thoughts (even if you are not religious it makes you think and probably reconsider a few things).But the thing that makes UNBREAKABLE truly great is not necessarily the story itself but how the story is told by director M NIGHT SHYAMALAN. His style offers some virtues in directing which seemed to be long lost!! SHYAMALAN likes to use long angles without any editing at all allowing us to watch the characters becoming real-life persons - and we are allowed to look at them and watch them as they are working things out, questioning themselves, struggling with the situation they are in. It also makes you appreciating the work of the actors involved even more. You can almost feel these people and you really start caring about them. It gives you the feeling of some sort of documentary of real people and real emotions. Well this only could work because The acting is marvellous as well (as it is in every SHYAMALAN film)! BRUCE WILLIS has never been better, he is a genuine character actor trapped in the body of an action star! And SAMUEL L JACKSON is always brilliant. He was able to shine in every single role he had done previously, no matter how dull or stupid his part was - fortunately these times are over, this movie is the prove (Give this man a life sized oscar, why don't you!). ROBIN WRIGHT PENN is great as well. Although her part doesn't give her much to do really, her understated performance fit in so perfectly and works without any signs of vanity and mannerism that you have to adore her for her professionalism which makes her a truly great actress - especially if you think of the high rank of UNBREAKABLE from the very beginning! SPENCER TREAT CLARK did an equally good job playing David Dunne's son Joseph. His performance is as good as JOSEPH CROSS was in WIDE AWAKE or HALEY JOEL OSMENT in THE SIXTH SENSE and all the other kids playing in M NIGHT SHYAMALAN's films.I think one of the reasons that made THE SIXTH SENSE a huge hit was the editing of the movie The editor of the film ANDREW MONDSHEIN did a great but more conventional job, making THE SIXTH SENSE faster in the terms of storytelling while UNBREAKABLE was edited by P. T. Anderson's editor DYLAN TICHENOR. His approach to films is lot more arthouse-like (but brilliant though). His low paced editing is much harder to find in the blockbuster movies of Hollywood. Since his style of editing is quite unfamiliar to the mass audiences which is certainly not used to concentrating on one angle alone for an entire scene I am not surprised that some movie goers consider this movie pretentious and even boring! I think that TICHENOR's editing fit in perfectly with SHYAMALAN's story telling (and is Oscar worthy), but Night should probably consider to reunite with ANDREW MONDHEIN who is clearly an editing genius in his own terms. His work gave THE SIXTH SENSE a little more `ooomph', and he as an editor is just as brilliant as SHYAMALAN is as a director and their styles match perfectly.Please, Night, do another one soon. I have started suffering from `Shyamalan Withdrawal' already!

She does not care what depth she has to sink to or how unflattering she'll come across, after all it's never her, always the character she's portraying. She'll always research that character until she can become them on the screen, which is why her performances are so painstaking realistic and believable. She never wins any major awards because `making people happy' always takes precedent over what should be important, which is the believability, accuracy, realness, the generally the way they come to life.This is not a movie where `a lot of things happen.' In fact, it's tempting to say that `not much happens,' but either would be totally missing the point because it's a character and relationship study about a main character that is incapable of getting things together, succeeding, and healing the wounds she's caused on those around her. It's also about a sister that tries her hardest to deal with this character. She can only take so much, but she can't bring herself to force her sister out of her life.As she always does when she's in the lead role, Leigh takes the movie on her back and gives a totally engrossing, multidimensional performance. A performance that should make you feel different things about her character at different times even though it's always obvious that Sadie is a no-hoper.Calling Sadie unlikable is misses the point to some extent because the characters and relationships in this movie are all so complex. Leigh's mother Barbara Turner wrote this story in a way that none of the relationships would be black and white. Sadie is the center of virtually every scene and wears her emotions on her shoulder, but with everyone else there's the spoken and the unspoken. Director Ulu Grosbard has left enough room for the viewer to interpret how everyone really feels toward Leigh.Sadie is frustrating in the sense that no matter how much people go out of their way to help her, it's useless. Sadie is the person that will always make herself the center of attention, and will suck everyone around her dry. This character is an incredibly flawed person, but the thing is she holds that certain power over people where she's so real, so emotional, and so interesting in addition to being so f***ed up that one way or another people are drawn to her. This is where Leigh's talent really comes to the forefront because she makes the character so interesting that you can see why, as hopeless as she is, the people around Sadie can't help but accept her with her flaws and try to help her. Sure, at some point most of them reach their limit, but even when they do you can see it's tearing them up inside. Aside from her sister Georgia (Winningham), no one really has the guts to confront her on why they have to get away from her, or even how awful her singing is and how out of hand her substance abuse is.Winningham's performance as the polar opposite sister is so impressive and worthy of supporting awards. She has the restraint and ability to be able to convey the emotions while staying in the background. That's the only way her character could credibly function because as the opposite of Leigh, she's the quiet, unassuming one that has her life totally together (aside from Leigh turning up when she's desperate and pulling her down). Even though she isn't passionate about her profession and doesn't care about fame and fortune, she is the highly successful singer because she's talented and doesn't do anything (aside from perhaps putting Leigh on stage) that would harm her career. Since she's got the dough, she's giving but look for the subtle falseness in the generosity.The most telling portion of the movie is when she puts Leigh on stage for one song at an AIDS benefit concert, and Leigh does the longest, most emotional rendition of Van Morrison's `Take Me Back.' The problem is the same as always, she's plastered, no one responds to her bizarre pre-song comments, and she sings as bad as anyone can possibly sing without sounding like they are just trying to sound awful. This song seems to go on forever, so Winningham finally reaches the point of embarrassment (and perhaps disgust) where she comes back on stage and makes it a duet so she can `save' her sister and end this debacle. Due to the actresses, a horrible song has never been so amazing to sit through. Of course, Sadie thinks that passion and living the music is what makes for an exceptional performance, so her voice (if she even notices it sucks) isn't important because her show (and her whole life for that matter) is essentially a display of pain open to the public. In the car after Georgia's show is over, Sadie has to ask her husband Axel (Max Perlich), Georgia's husband Jake (Ted Levine), and Georgia `was I great or was I great?' Perlich & Levine, who don't get a tremendous amount of screen time but still offer strong support, agree she was great (well, Levine says she was something so again it's open for interpretation, but to Leigh it's an agreement), but Winningham doesn't want to say anything. After being prodded, she finally can't hold back her real feelings anymore, although she still says it in the `is this what you want to here' way. The true irony of the scene is that throughout the movie, and especially when Sadie got Georgia to come up and sing a duet with her at one of her performances before a few drunks by putting Georgia on the spot, Sadie had always tried to outdo Georgia and steal her thunder.

There's none of that it has to be happy and uplifting crap to take away so much of the power of what came before it. There's what we already knew followed by one line from Sadie that shows a small positive change in her character, but at the same time does not lead you to believe that she's poised for either a slow or sudden spiral in either direction.

Director Ulu Grosbard has left enough room for the viewer to interpret how everyone really feels toward Leigh.Sadie is frustrating in the sense that no matter how much people go out of their way to help her, it's useless. Sadie is the person that will always make herself the center of attention, and will suck everyone around her dry. This character is an incredibly flawed person, but the thing is she holds that certain power over people where she's so real, so emotional, and so interesting in addition to being so f***ed up that one way or another people are drawn to her. This is where Leigh's talent really comes to the forefront because she makes the character so interesting that you can see why, as hopeless as she is, the people around Sadie can't help but accept her with her flaws and try to help her. Sure, at some point most of them reach their limit, but even when they do you can see it's tearing them up inside. Aside from her sister Georgia (Winningham), no one really has the guts to confront her on why they have to get away from her, or even how awful her singing is and how out of hand her substance abuse is.Winningham's performance as the polar opposite sister is so impressive and worthy of supporting awards. She has the restraint and ability to be able to convey the emotions while staying in the background. That's the only way her character could credibly function because as the opposite of Leigh, she's the quiet, unassuming one that has her life totally together (aside from Leigh turning up when she's desperate and pulling her down). Even though she isn't passionate about her profession and doesn't care about fame and fortune, she is the highly successful singer because she's talented and doesn't do anything (aside from perhaps putting Leigh on stage) that would harm her career. Since she's got the dough, she's giving but look for the subtle falseness in the generosity.The most telling portion of the movie is when she puts Leigh on stage for one song at an AIDS benefit concert, and Leigh does the longest, most emotional rendition of Van Morrison's `Take Me Back.' The problem is the same as always, she's plastered, no one responds to her bizarre pre-song comments, and she sings as bad as anyone can possibly sing without sounding like they are just trying to sound awful. This song seems to go on forever, so Winningham finally reaches the point of embarrassment (and perhaps disgust) where she comes back on stage and makes it a duet so she can `save' her sister and end this debacle. Due to the actresses, a horrible song has never been so amazing to sit through. Of course, Sadie thinks that passion and living the music is what makes for an exceptional performance, so her voice (if she even notices it sucks) isn't important because her show (and her whole life for that matter) is essentially a display of pain open to the public. In the car after Georgia's show is over, Sadie has to ask her husband Axel (Max Perlich), Georgia's husband Jake (Ted Levine), and Georgia `was I great or was I great?' Perlich & Levine, who don't get a tremendous amount of screen time but still offer strong support, agree she was great (well, Levine says she was something so again it's open for interpretation, but to Leigh it's an agreement), but Winningham doesn't want to say anything. After being prodded, she finally can't hold back her real feelings anymore, although she still says it in the `is this what you want to here' way. The true irony of the scene is that throughout the movie, and especially when Sadie got Georgia to come up and sing a duet with her at one of her performances before a few drunks by putting Georgia on the spot, Sadie had always tried to outdo Georgia and steal her thunder. That's the point of the title, although Sadie is the character that gets all the attention and thus screen time, everything she does always comes back to her sister Georgia.*Spoiler alert*This is a movie that doesn't have a definitive beginning and ending point. By that I mean, it's obvious that the events were going on long before we started seeing them and they'll continue long after we've left them. That's why the ending of this movie is so perfect. There's none of that it has to be happy and uplifting crap to take away so much of the power of what came before it. There's what we already knew followed by one line from Sadie that shows a small positive change in her character, but at the same time does not lead you to believe that she's poised for either a slow or sudden spiral in either direction. These sisters are who they are.This may not be a movie that you'll think is one of the greatest of all-time, but Leigh's performance and the basis of the movie itself should stick with you for a long time. 9\/10.

He manages to warn the president in time (he's the ex-husband of one of the president's advisors, no less), and they evacuate just before the ships fire down on the cities, and soon 36 of the world's largest and most powerful cities have been reduced to rubble.The humans aim for a counterattack, with fighter jets to take down the ships, but as Captain Steven Hiller (Will Smith) and his squad figure out, these ships have some sort of force field that prevent penetration from any object.

Eventually, all the characters meet in Area 51, buried secrets of the past are unearthed, and discussions and plans of ways of fighting back are brought into light.There's really nothing to get excited about concerning this film.  It has a few exciting action scenes, some humorous bits, and a barrage of outstanding special effects, but it's rather dissatisfying.  There's not nearly as much action as you would hope for, and I would like to have seen some hand-to-hand combat, not just some aerial dogfights.  The movie is basically hollow entertainment, and even then, it tries the patience with the slow buildup in the first hour.  If you want entertaining and non-stop sci-fi action, go with Starship Troopers, and if you want a better film a similar storyline, then just stick with Star Wars.Roland Emmerich isn't exactly a director that's well known for helming compelling scripts and Independence Day is no different.  The screenplay features a bevy of plot holes and blatant stupidity, most of which appear in the final half hour, as the ridiculous plan to fight back the aliens strikes me as lame-brained.  Emmerich is adept at handling special effects and action, but a good bit of it feels like it's for naught with some of the outright idiocy of the story behind it.The performances are merely average.

Now, having spent about 8 hours viewing (twice) and studying this film and the extras on the DVD, I am prepared to comment.

The 1911 random killing of a store owner in London's Greenberry Hill, by 3 men whose names were Green, Berry, and Hill. The 1983 accidental scooping up of a scuba diver by a fire-fighting plane, after the diver and the pilot had been in a gambling-related altercation two days earlier. The perfectly-timed accidental shooting in 1958 of the boy attempting suicide, shot by his mother as he fell past a window, after the boy had loaded the gun so the parents, who always bickered, could shoot themselves.The saying is introduced, The book says, we may be through with the past, but the past is not through with us. Meaning, seemingly strange things, or strange coincidences, may simply be our past having its way with us, to right the wrongs. And this concept is what ties into the final few scenes of the film. Is the book he refers to The Bible??Tom Cruise, Jason Robards, Julianne Moore, William Macy, Artie Johnson, and several great but lesser-know actors play the parts. Robards is a wealthy TV producer, father of estranged son Cruise, and who is rapidly dying of cancer, and Moore is his young wife who married him for money, and cheated on him many times, but has now fallen in love with him and can't deal with his impending death. Macy is former Whiz Kid Donnie, a homosexual, who can't quite get his life and job priorities in order after his father spent all his winnings. The game-show host is also dying, has cheated on his wife, and when she was young had molested his now estranged daughter. The daughter sniffs coke and picks up men for casual sex, meets a good-guy cop who had been called to investigate because of noise and loud music. There is a modern-day whiz kid whose father abuses him simply by demanding that he know all the quiz show answers and set the money-winning record.Each of the 8 or 10 stories are told in parallel over this one day in the L.A. area, and done so very well. All the characters end up being at least loosely connected, and the running thread is that today's problems have been caused by sins of the father. As the film starts, most of the characters seem on the surface to be in control of their lives, but we quickly see that they in fact are all out of control, with the exception of the cop, who is a devout Christian, and the wife of the TV game show host. Both of them are good people who are even taken aback at hearing the use of swear words. At one point, each character, in turn, joins in singing the lyrics of a background song, It's not going to stop until you wise up. Much like you would find in a musical production, like A Chorus Line, on stage.Which brings me to my second big gripe with the film and its script. The use of the F-word is pervasive and, in my opinion, grossly overdone. I'm no prude, but just like too much spice will spoil great food, in this film too much F-word spice brings the script from extraordinary to just ordinary or worse.  Watching the making-of special explains this - the author\/director uses the same expletive in his normal conversation, but that is no excuse. We are to believe that these characters in L.A. speak like that, and maybe they do, but I usually assume a film is made for a broader audience. A good writer can still convey anger, grief, exasperation without simply reverting automatically to the F-word as his main vehicle.The film comes to its climax during a day when it was raining cats and dogs, as more than one character comments. Later, it actually begins to rain frogs! Large bullfrogs!  One review that I read references Exodus 82, regarding God inflicting a plague of frogs on Egypt. This may in fact be what the writer intended to reference, however I could not find it spelled out. However, the Exodus tie-in is not essential, because the prologue established that this film is about strange things happening, and they are caused by some higher power, God for most of us. However, it does make sense, a plague of frogs sent as punishment.The frogs are not just for effect, one falls through a home skylight and deflects the gun at his head just before the TV host pulled the trigger, attempting to commit suicide. Another hits Donnie in the face as he is climbing a light pole (to reverse his theft of cash), causes him to fall and bust up his face. And, while frogs are falling near the cop, his gun, lost during the night, also falls from the sky!!The dying men come to terms with their sins, those who were messed up by them begin to rebuild their lives. The modern whiz kid tells his dad he has to start being nicer to him. The cop starts to help the abused daughter gain some self-esteem. In the totality of the film is a fulfillment of the past isn't through with us until the wrongs are righted!The way the movie is written and filmed makes it somewhat difficult to know how to take it. On the one hand it seems to be the simple theme of redemption from the sins of the father. However, take for instance the What Do Kids Know game show, pitting 3 adults against 3 kids. The questions are absurdly complex and difficult. What is the original language of the following line, and if you can sing it you get bonus points.  The young boy names it, and sings it, perfectly. I think it was intended to be way over the top, an absurdity, a parody of game shows.Or, take the Cruise seminar Seduce and Destroy.  It is done in a combination of a revival style and that of a corporate sales training seminar. It is so radical in its style and message we instinctively know it would never fly in the real world. These kinds of parodies make me believe the writer\/director means for the whole movie to be sort of absurd dark comedy, much like Being John Malkovich is, or Dr. Strangelove was.Also, the young black kid who we see a couple of times, delivers his message in rap, but he is for the most part not comprehendible. I must assume his character was essential to the film, but we don't really know why, or what he is saying.  Maybe he is supposed to be a modern prophet, and he is the one who recovers the cop's lost gun, and who sees to it that it rains down with the frogs.In the writer's apparent concession that his script isn't easy to comprehend, has several monologues where main characters explain large chunks of past sins, otherwise there would be large holes. The film, at slightly over 3 hours, runs a bit long. Some of the scenes where Robards is mumbling semi-conscious in his bed are well-done, but just seem to drag on way too long.  In contrast to most of the film which is paced just right.It is unfortunate that the extras on the DVD do not include the director's commentary track as an option, or at least a short review in his own words about what he intended for this film. Perhaps part of his intention is for each of us to take away from it what we want to.Wow, this is the longest review I've ever written, but this is a very complex movie. I was thoroughly absorbed both times I viewed it. The pervasive foul language gave me some discomfort but did not obscure the message.

The 1983 accidental scooping up of a scuba diver by a fire-fighting plane, after the diver and the pilot had been in a gambling-related altercation two days earlier. The perfectly-timed accidental shooting in 1958 of the boy attempting suicide, shot by his mother as he fell past a window, after the boy had loaded the gun so the parents, who always bickered, could shoot themselves.The saying is introduced, The book says, we may be through with the past, but the past is not through with us. Meaning, seemingly strange things, or strange coincidences, may simply be our past having its way with us, to right the wrongs. And this concept is what ties into the final few scenes of the film. Is the book he refers to The Bible??Tom Cruise, Jason Robards, Julianne Moore, William Macy, Artie Johnson, and several great but lesser-know actors play the parts. Robards is a wealthy TV producer, father of estranged son Cruise, and who is rapidly dying of cancer, and Moore is his young wife who married him for money, and cheated on him many times, but has now fallen in love with him and can't deal with his impending death. Macy is former Whiz Kid Donnie, a homosexual, who can't quite get his life and job priorities in order after his father spent all his winnings. The game-show host is also dying, has cheated on his wife, and when she was young had molested his now estranged daughter. The daughter sniffs coke and picks up men for casual sex, meets a good-guy cop who had been called to investigate because of noise and loud music. There is a modern-day whiz kid whose father abuses him simply by demanding that he know all the quiz show answers and set the money-winning record.Each of the 8 or 10 stories are told in parallel over this one day in the L.A. area, and done so very well. All the characters end up being at least loosely connected, and the running thread is that today's problems have been caused by sins of the father. As the film starts, most of the characters seem on the surface to be in control of their lives, but we quickly see that they in fact are all out of control, with the exception of the cop, who is a devout Christian, and the wife of the TV game show host. Both of them are good people who are even taken aback at hearing the use of swear words. At one point, each character, in turn, joins in singing the lyrics of a background song, It's not going to stop until you wise up. Much like you would find in a musical production, like A Chorus Line, on stage.Which brings me to my second big gripe with the film and its script. The use of the F-word is pervasive and, in my opinion, grossly overdone. I'm no prude, but just like too much spice will spoil great food, in this film too much F-word spice brings the script from extraordinary to just ordinary or worse.  Watching the making-of special explains this - the author\/director uses the same expletive in his normal conversation, but that is no excuse. We are to believe that these characters in L.A. speak like that, and maybe they do, but I usually assume a film is made for a broader audience. A good writer can still convey anger, grief, exasperation without simply reverting automatically to the F-word as his main vehicle.The film comes to its climax during a day when it was raining cats and dogs, as more than one character comments. Later, it actually begins to rain frogs! Large bullfrogs!  One review that I read references Exodus 82, regarding God inflicting a plague of frogs on Egypt. This may in fact be what the writer intended to reference, however I could not find it spelled out. However, the Exodus tie-in is not essential, because the prologue established that this film is about strange things happening, and they are caused by some higher power, God for most of us. However, it does make sense, a plague of frogs sent as punishment.The frogs are not just for effect, one falls through a home skylight and deflects the gun at his head just before the TV host pulled the trigger, attempting to commit suicide. Another hits Donnie in the face as he is climbing a light pole (to reverse his theft of cash), causes him to fall and bust up his face. And, while frogs are falling near the cop, his gun, lost during the night, also falls from the sky!!The dying men come to terms with their sins, those who were messed up by them begin to rebuild their lives. The modern whiz kid tells his dad he has to start being nicer to him. The cop starts to help the abused daughter gain some self-esteem. In the totality of the film is a fulfillment of the past isn't through with us until the wrongs are righted!The way the movie is written and filmed makes it somewhat difficult to know how to take it. On the one hand it seems to be the simple theme of redemption from the sins of the father. However, take for instance the What Do Kids Know game show, pitting 3 adults against 3 kids. The questions are absurdly complex and difficult. What is the original language of the following line, and if you can sing it you get bonus points.  The young boy names it, and sings it, perfectly. I think it was intended to be way over the top, an absurdity, a parody of game shows.Or, take the Cruise seminar Seduce and Destroy.  It is done in a combination of a revival style and that of a corporate sales training seminar. It is so radical in its style and message we instinctively know it would never fly in the real world. These kinds of parodies make me believe the writer\/director means for the whole movie to be sort of absurd dark comedy, much like Being John Malkovich is, or Dr. Strangelove was.Also, the young black kid who we see a couple of times, delivers his message in rap, but he is for the most part not comprehendible. I must assume his character was essential to the film, but we don't really know why, or what he is saying.  Maybe he is supposed to be a modern prophet, and he is the one who recovers the cop's lost gun, and who sees to it that it rains down with the frogs.In the writer's apparent concession that his script isn't easy to comprehend, has several monologues where main characters explain large chunks of past sins, otherwise there would be large holes. The film, at slightly over 3 hours, runs a bit long. Some of the scenes where Robards is mumbling semi-conscious in his bed are well-done, but just seem to drag on way too long.  In contrast to most of the film which is paced just right.It is unfortunate that the extras on the DVD do not include the director's commentary track as an option, or at least a short review in his own words about what he intended for this film. Perhaps part of his intention is for each of us to take away from it what we want to.Wow, this is the longest review I've ever written, but this is a very complex movie. I was thoroughly absorbed both times I viewed it. The pervasive foul language gave me some discomfort but did not obscure the message. It isn't for everyone, and I can certainly see how people can hate it, while others love it. I am glad I watched it, and am satisfied my 7 rating accurately represents where it fits among other films I have seen.

Oliver Stone created a stir with his `JFK' premise that everyone killed John F.

And `Hurricane' was battered-and perhaps star Denzel Washington lost the Academy Award for best actor--when critics began to point out its inaccuracies.The fact is that few people have the time or knowledge to challenge the accuracy of what's being portrayed on the screen.  Such is the case with Steven Soderbergh's `Traffic.'  Soderbergh marshals some statistics about how the money spend in transporting drugs far outstrips the amount being spent on stopping the flow of narcotics into this country, and shows the political posturing of the American government and the corruption of the Mexican government.  He also does a bit of preaching A scene in which Michael Douglas and Amy Irving blame each other for their daughter's drug use makes the familiar argument that there are all sorts of narcotics out there.  His conclusion is that the situation is continuing to get worse, and the war is unwinnable.  Soderbergh may be right about all this-we just have to trust him.  But what if things are getting better?Aside from that caution, this is a good if not film.  Soderbergh does several fine things.  First of all, his structure involves three separate stories that interlink at points, but not always.  Secondly, he does an interesting thing with lighting.  He films scenes in Mexico in a washed out tone, creating a feeling of both desolation and dread.  Finally, he assembles an outstanding cast.  Michael Douglas and real-life wife Catherine Zeta-Jones-though they never appear on screen together-head the list of Academy Award possibles.  So does Benicio Del Toro as a decent Mexican cop.   His role is almost entirely in Mexican Spanish, a dialect he had to learn for the movie.   Don Cheadle turns in another strong performance, as does Miguel Ferrer, who might finally gain some recognition from this film as a great character actor.Soderbergh does trip up at one point.  An attempt(s) to take out Ferrer portrays the DEA as being unable to perform the most basic type of security.

And when he talks of traversing millions of miles, it's your miles. Now, call me a stickler for detail, but an alien race that just happened to evolve exactly the same words for time and distance as ours? What are the chances of that happening? And note that it's not a more respectable light years he's travelled.This may all sound like quibbling, but now I've set this sacred cow up for the slaughter, it's time to justify my argument. For The Day The Earth Stood Still is widely regarded as one of the all-time greats of movie SF. And, for it's era, that's a valid view. But ironically its contemporary failure is highlighted by its title. The Earth hasn't stood still. And the staid direction, acting and dialogue &#150; Holy Christmas! &#150; of the film makes it now hopelessly dated.

I couldn't quite tell. Around this time Klaatu develops a trend for pious moralising and platitudes. So much so that a reporter, getting vox pops from a crowd, legs it after being bored silly by the stiffest alien this side of Mr.Spock on his mating ritual. And as for Bobby &#150; would such a young boy really have a mathematician as an idol-worshipped role model? Mind you, this was 1951 &#150; men still wore hats, and rock and roll had yet to be invented.However, it soon turns out that Klaatu has a system &#150; you've gotta have a system, haven't you? &#150; and doesn't really care about our planet's wars, but is merely worried about the threat to his own. If Earth develops atomic weapons in space then it will, he explains, be eliminated. Eventually Klaatu hits on an ingenious idea to get back his spaceship &#150; go at night when there'll only be two people guarding it, of course! Bobby, the world's most neglected child, is again abandoned by mum and potential step-dad, causing him to follow Klaatu and so further the plot.This eventually leads to the alien's big speech, which is all peace, being nice to one another, etc. It's all very well meant, though the lack of allegory does cause you to question how stupid the filmmakers thought their audience was. Klaatu's death is clearly signposted (and given away in the first sentence of The Rocky Horror Picture Show) where he speaks of what Gort would do in such an eventuality. Apparently Gort &#150; an extra in a cheap rubber suit &#150; is an indestructible robot that could destroy the Earth.Best bit? The shadows cast over Klaatu's face in the elevator, oddly reminiscent of The Seventh Seal. Worst bit? The accent in the paralysed London scene. Who did the dubbing, Dick Van Dyke?

As it is, perhaps the greatest legacy the film can offer is Neal's proactive role and unusual function as single parent. The sliding ramps on the UFO are great, and the movie must be praised for flying in the face of anti-Communist convention.
