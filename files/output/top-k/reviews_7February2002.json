Before going to the movie, I knew that it was about war but maybe I expected to also see something intelligent and a human side to it instead of simply people shooting.  All I have to say is that I can't understand why someone would enjoy this movie.  If you tasted what war is in your life, you would hate the movie, find it sick & spit in on it.  From the beginning of the movie until the end, all you hear and see are weapons being shot and people getting killed like some video game.  There's not 1 minute in it where there isn't violence.  It's as if the point of the director is  shoot & kill as much as you can!!  I didn't find it entertaining and after a while I didn't care who was dying anymore, the whole time I was shaking my head thinking to myself that we humans are the most pathetic & sick creatures on earth.   The only refreshing thing about the movie is seeing a couple of DOGS and a DONKEY.  It reminded me the true value of life & that at least the animals do know how to appreciate it.  Watching people kill each others each second shouldn't be entertaining, if you had lost some of your loved ones in a war, you would DEFINITELY NOT FIND THIS MOVIE ENTERTAINING, YOU WOULD FIND IT SICK, no matter what the political reason is!  I really hope that they stop promoting war, there's another way to deal with problems.  Take out the weapons and everyone would be forced to sit down and talk.  Believe it or not, most of the weapons of those terrorists in the movie were actually BOUGHT from countries including the USA.  How pathetic is that?  Anyways, I'm not reviewing the movie about it's technical part and how well it's done, some people are even saying it could win oscars, but to me this movie is sick & not watchable unless you enjoy seeing us humans killing each others.  You may not agree with my view but I hope that you will at least understand.

These are the kinds of films that critics see that make them feel they are kings of their own castles.  These are the kinds of films that make them feel as though they are the wise in a land filled with commoners that know little or nothing at all about film.  But ask yourself this question, is a film made to become a critical success or is it made to appease an audience?  I have always believed that the best films offer an equal amount to each side.  I think it is wise for films to offer some material that will make you think long after the film is over but it is also prudent to give the audience what it wants to see.  After all, at the end of day, we all want to see movies so that we may be entertained.Monster's Ball is a film in the tradition of Affliction, Last Tango In Paris and The Pledge.  These are the types of films where great actors take on roles they normally shun in the name of garnering some Oscar nods.  They may be at a lull in their career or they are just financially secure enough that they can do something a little unorthodox.  These are the films that have a pretty standard thought process behind them, contrary to what critics will have you believe.  The guidelines to films like this can range from anything from sex to cure loneliness, middle-aged crisis in a small town or problems in your life stemming from your own pedigree.  They all work by the numbers and all are praised as being landmark films, or a daring and risky effort by all involved, or mesmerizing....(said actor) shows range and versatility that he\/she has never displayed before.  And really it is all just a publicity ploy to get you to watch a film that you may not have ordinarily flocked to in the first place.  Monster's Ball falls into this category.Billy Bob Thorton plays a second generation prison guard named Hank Growtowski, who cares for his retired prison guard father and also lives with his son, who is also a prison guard at the same prison and under his father's command.  His son, Sonny is portrayed by Heath Ledger and as the film opens, they are preparing to execute a black man named Lawrence Musgrove, played by Sean Combs.  Sonny has grown up with racism all around him.  When you live with a grandfather and a father that have racist tendencies, it is hard to grow up and become anything but a racist.  But Sonny doesn't end up like his elders and regularly plays with the younger black children that live down the way and even tries to show humanity Musgrove as he is living his last night before his execution. Sonny has a hard time with the execution and messes up protocol and is degraded, berated and chastised by his father in front of the other prison guards.  His father thinks of him as a disgrace and once he finishes his diatribe at the prison, he continues it at his home.  Perhaps being pushed one to many times, Sonny is prepared for his father's assault at home and this time he turns the tables and ultimately gives his father something that he will never forget.  If this is the path the film stayed with and chose to focus on, I feel it would have been much better.  To give Hank his awakening through Sonny alone would have been a little more intriguing than what transpires in the next segment of the film.Halle Berry plays Luticia Musgrove, the wife of Lawrence.  She comes to visit her husband in jail only for the benefit of her overweight child.  Once the man is executed, she holds no love lost for the man that probably gave her years of truculent days and tumultuous nights.  From here, Luticia and Hank somehow manage to find each other and through these two characters we have the recrudescence of Hank.  He sees things in a different light after meeting her and at the end all is well that ends well.The key to this film is the performances.  Although I think the film is adequate, if not spectacular, the performances by the two leads are what makes the film as intriguing as it is.  Billy Bob Thorton has proven himself to be one of the best actors working today.  He will probably get an Oscar nod for either this film or for his work in The Man Who Wasn't There.  He perhaps should get a nod for both.  He is that good.  He has a smooth presentation and understanding of who he's portraying in the film and there is not one second in the film when I didn't think the man I was watching wasn't Hank Growtowski.  Thorton plays the role to perfection.  Berry on the other hand is equally as impressive as the scurrilous and destitude Luticia.  This is a woman that exudes desperation.  She can't keep a job, she is losing her house, her ex husband has been executed and her son is eating himself to death.  She seems to be in an eternal down spiral, and anyone who has ever been through a rough time will certainly relate to her character.  When things go bad, they often seem as though they are never going to improve.  Berry makes you empathize with this character.  A perfect scene is when she gives a customer a bill for $3.94 and he gives her $4.00 and then vapidly tells her to keep the change.  This is a woman that hated her job before at a busy diner where she probably got a paultry two or three dollars for a tip and now she has sunk to the bottom of the barrel and has to thank a customer for giving her eight cents.  As they say, you have to sink to bottom before you can start your ascent.Monster's Ball is the kind of film that won't be given a wealth of recognition, and although it is a good film, I found it to be uneven.  There were times when I was rivetted and completely interested in the story and there times when I was debating on whether or not I should duck out and go see Mothman Prophecies ( best film of 2002, and will be hands down when the year ends ) for the fourth time.  There is a story worth telling here but at times it just stops being entertaining and it borders on lifelessness.  I enjoyed watching the relationship with Sonny and his father and I also enjoyed Luticia's struggles but there were areas such as the conflict with Hank and his dad and some of the metaphors in the film that just seemed tired and old.  I mean how many times can you tell the story of racism before you say to yourself that you have seen it all before?Monster's Ball is not a bad film, in fact, there are probably more positive qualities about it than there are negative but to be labelled as the best film of the year is a farce.  What it boils down to a racist white guy becomes a non racist white guy after he rolls in the hay with a beautiful black girl.  That is really the gist of it.I would like to see Thorton and Berry get some recognition at the Oscar's and even Heath Ledger should get a nod for best supporting actor.  But in the end, you have to realize that when films like this generally get ignored by the public, it is because we know more than critics think we do.  There is a reason why films like Armageddon, E.T., Raiders of the Lost Ark, Jurassic Park and Rambo make oodles of money and why films like Affliction and Monster's Ball struggle to find an audience on video.  To say this is the best film of the year isn't really that much of a stretch seeing what was released this year was generally average at best.  But to ignore films like Lord of the Rings and Vanilla Sky is asinine and unfair.  You can't always say that just because a film has a budget nearing the 100 million dollar mark that it has to be worse than a film with nearly 10 times less the cost.  Monster's Ball is okay, just don't expect it to connect with you the way others have praised.6 out of 10 ","genre":null},{"date":"7 February 2002","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":"  Does contain spoilersI am often amused when certain films are released and are lionized by the critics and ignored by the public.

Sonny has grown up with racism all around him.  When you live with a grandfather and a father that have racist tendencies, it is hard to grow up and become anything but a racist.  But Sonny doesn't end up like his elders and regularly plays with the younger black children that live down the way and even tries to show humanity Musgrove as he is living his last night before his execution. Sonny has a hard time with the execution and messes up protocol and is degraded, berated and chastised by his father in front of the other prison guards.  His father thinks of him as a disgrace and once he finishes his diatribe at the prison, he continues it at his home.  Perhaps being pushed one to many times, Sonny is prepared for his father's assault at home and this time he turns the tables and ultimately gives his father something that he will never forget.  If this is the path the film stayed with and chose to focus on, I feel it would have been much better.  To give Hank his awakening through Sonny alone would have been a little more intriguing than what transpires in the next segment of the film.Halle Berry plays Luticia Musgrove, the wife of Lawrence.  She comes to visit her husband in jail only for the benefit of her overweight child.  Once the man is executed, she holds no love lost for the man that probably gave her years of truculent days and tumultuous nights.  From here, Luticia and Hank somehow manage to find each other and through these two characters we have the recrudescence of Hank.  He sees things in a different light after meeting her and at the end all is well that ends well.The key to this film is the performances.  Although I think the film is adequate, if not spectacular, the performances by the two leads are what makes the film as intriguing as it is.  Billy Bob Thorton has proven himself to be one of the best actors working today.  He will probably get an Oscar nod for either this film or for his work in The Man Who Wasn't There.  He perhaps should get a nod for both.  He is that good.  He has a smooth presentation and understanding of who he's portraying in the film and there is not one second in the film when I didn't think the man I was watching wasn't Hank Growtowski.  Thorton plays the role to perfection.  Berry on the other hand is equally as impressive as the scurrilous and destitude Luticia.  This is a woman that exudes desperation.  She can't keep a job, she is losing her house, her ex husband has been executed and her son is eating himself to death.  She seems to be in an eternal down spiral, and anyone who has ever been through a rough time will certainly relate to her character.  When things go bad, they often seem as though they are never going to improve.  Berry makes you empathize with this character.  A perfect scene is when she gives a customer a bill for $3.94 and he gives her $4.00 and then vapidly tells her to keep the change.  This is a woman that hated her job before at a busy diner where she probably got a paultry two or three dollars for a tip and now she has sunk to the bottom of the barrel and has to thank a customer for giving her eight cents.  As they say, you have to sink to bottom before you can start your ascent.Monster's Ball is the kind of film that won't be given a wealth of recognition, and although it is a good film, I found it to be uneven.  There were times when I was rivetted and completely interested in the story and there times when I was debating on whether or not I should duck out and go see Mothman Prophecies ( best film of 2002, and will be hands down when the year ends ) for the fourth time.  There is a story worth telling here but at times it just stops being entertaining and it borders on lifelessness.  I enjoyed watching the relationship with Sonny and his father and I also enjoyed Luticia's struggles but there were areas such as the conflict with Hank and his dad and some of the metaphors in the film that just seemed tired and old.  I mean how many times can you tell the story of racism before you say to yourself that you have seen it all before?Monster's Ball is not a bad film, in fact, there are probably more positive qualities about it than there are negative but to be labelled as the best film of the year is a farce.  What it boils down to a racist white guy becomes a non racist white guy after he rolls in the hay with a beautiful black girl.  That is really the gist of it.I would like to see Thorton and Berry get some recognition at the Oscar's and even Heath Ledger should get a nod for best supporting actor.  But in the end, you have to realize that when films like this generally get ignored by the public, it is because we know more than critics think we do.  There is a reason why films like Armageddon, E.T., Raiders of the Lost Ark, Jurassic Park and Rambo make oodles of money and why films like Affliction and Monster's Ball struggle to find an audience on video.  To say this is the best film of the year isn't really that much of a stretch seeing what was released this year was generally average at best.  But to ignore films like Lord of the Rings and Vanilla Sky is asinine and unfair.  You can't always say that just because a film has a budget nearing the 100 million dollar mark that it has to be worse than a film with nearly 10 times less the cost.  Monster's Ball is okay, just don't expect it to connect with you the way others have praised.6 out of 10 ","genre":"Drama, Romance"},{"date":"7 February 2002","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" very little of what passes for media, or even worse, art, actually does anything to confront society's ills. people constantly harp on hollywood as promoting violence and hastening the decay of society, when, in fact, hollywood is merely icing on an already rotten cake. fight club has the audacity not only to expose the abcess at the core of the modern world, but to also show how simple mindless reaction to that decay is equally evil.fight club has the balls to actually confront the problems of the modern world. in a world where faction on both sides of the political spectrum peddle simple answers (just say no, violence in movies is killing us, etc) no one has ever bothered to even mention that our lives are hollow. in the film, tyler durden is created as a reaction to that. in claiming that rejection of materialism and a comfortable lifestyle in favor of a weekly dingy club where men beat the crap out of each other, fight club trades the nervous shell of comfort for the hard fist of real, honest feeling. pain, it says, is better than numbness, and there is some substance there. ultimately, though, it isn't fight club's violent reaction that saves jack, but his connection with marla. this is another way of peeling back the disguise. simple mindless reaction to conformity is not what will save us. in the end, it's is our isolation which makes us hollow, and our connecting with other people that will save us.this is tough for some people to see, and to accept. maybe alot of folks would like to have jack's life, full of pre-fab furniture and a dull day to day job. this has been promoted as the american dream, and frankly, it sucks. lives of boring conformity and consumerism are not anywhere near as fulfilling as lives filled with passion, even if that passion comes with a struggle or a price. dullness, comfort, and hollwness are not something to aspire to, but something to avoid.some people were bothered by the violence of fight club. to be honest, i didn't even notice. the story is so deep, and works on so many levels, that i was caught up in  trying to take it all in.i find it interesting to see how many people were not only upset by the content, but by the visual style of the film. it is gritty, muddy and dark. that isn't a mistake or a lack of insight. it is exactly how this movie should look. it is daring, and flies in the face of the soft focus, backlighting rampant in so much mainstream film making.

The book made me dream of the world of K-PAX and I really wanted to go there. Pick me..., I remember I once said, as everyone else probably did when reading the novel.What bothers me most about the film though, is not the adaption itself, since it follows the book much better than any adaption ever has done before it. This is a good thing. However, bits and pieces are missing, and when leaving the theater I understand what it is that I miss the most it is the politics of K-PAX! K-PAX is in the novel an anarcho-syndicalistic world in its most pure essence. It is a world without money, without rules, without law and lawyers as PROT states it. But it is still a world in peace.I remember when I read it that I said to myself that this can't work in the US. And when watching the movie, I understand that it didn't. Actually, almost everything of the message in the book is erased! K-PAX is a lovely world - but what if we tried to re-create it here on Earth? Well, I guess the producers didn't want to take a risk developing a too socialstic idea on the screen.Gene Brewer's ideas are not only interesting.

It is more sad than I thought it would be, but PROT is as nice and thoughtful that I always has visioned him. Kevin Spacey does a wonderful, maybe his best, performance. Jeff Bridges is also good, and it is a wise, if not strange choice, to cast him as the doctor when thinking of that he made STARMAN in 1984.PROT is yet an alien that is put in the line of Starman, E.T. and the rest of the friendly aliens from Hollywood. However, PROT has a message to us earthlings that the others didn't really have. You won't get this message by watching the movie; no, then you'd only get a good time.

In true postmodern fashion, this film brilliantly explores the narcissistic and schizophrenic nature of Hollywood and the human individual. A complex and labyrinth of love, naivete, heartache, broken dreams (literal and metaphoric), unfixed identities and plot twists, Mulholland Drive encourages multiple viewings as it is itself comprised of multiple meanings.Equally multiple are the paralleled layers of identity and reality in this film. Drive mirrors the film industry which reflects our own dream worlds, our reconstructions of ourselves and our realities. The film seduces the members of its audience, changing them into riddle-solvers like Oedipa Maas in Thomas Pynchon's novel The Crying of Lot 49, and like Betty (Watts) and Rita (Harring) themselves. The audience, once its identity has been shifted into that of detective, tries to piece together and make sense out of Drive's ostensibly inexplicable connections and ever-shifting identities and occurrences. As the film eludes resolution, it leaves its audience wondering is there such a thing as an authentic or fixed identity? Do demons and nightmares emerge, as they do for Diane, when we lose ourselves in our dream worlds (be they in the movies or in our own imaginations)? Or are fluid and multiple identities and realities perhaps more authentic and real than what we perceive as real? Moreover, does not having a fixed self or fixed reality offer the human individual a wealth of potential and possibilities? The surreal may not be all that bad after all, which may be what Lynch is hinting at in Drive. The two moments in the film that best encapsulate the value and dignity of the complex human individual are the love scene between Betty and Rita, rendered with utmost tenderness, and Del Toro's beautiful rendition of Roy Orbison's Crying, which compels the audience to cry along with Betty and Rita and to cry at the simultaneous beauty and ugliness of human existence that Drive mirrors so well. The film's end seduces the audience one last time with a reminder, Silencio..., but Mulholland Drive seduces us to be anything but silent about its noir world. Once it becomes your parallel universe, you will find yourself continuously driving through its labyrinth of multiple meanings and possible interpretations, reconstructing your reality again and again.

His ability to move seamlessly from genre to genre, still covering the themes of man's metamorphosis, his place in the universe and his desire to choose between right and wrong, is something some filmmakers never manage.  If his previous film 2001 A Space Odyssey was his attempt to look at man's place in existence, the surely A Clockwork Orange is a look at man's place in society, not in any Ken Loach, lower class, upper class rivalry way, but in how man functions in society.  The question raised by Kubrick and writer Anthony Burgess is `if man cannot freely choose between right or wrong does he cease to be a man?'  Kubrick and Burgess seem to be in agreement, yes!  But whereas Burgess' novel showed us that, given time, the person will soon grow-up and decide for themselves, once and for all, what path to choose in life.  But because Kubrick missed the last chapter of the book, the film takes on an entirely different agenda. The year is now 2002, we have sailed through the year that Kubrick made famous with his watershed sci-fi picture, and we stand looking out at an uncertain future, and one thing that stands out, is the shocking similarities between the fantasy of A Clockwork Orange, and the reality of the everyday world.  Hooligans are everywhere, teenage louts that have elderly people too terrified to leave their homes after dark, our countries are run by lying, back-stabbing politicians who are always out for their own gain, and now scientists are looking into new treatments for the correction and rehabilitation of violent offenders.  It's not hard to see the pompous politicians of A Clockwork Orange and not subliminally think of Jack Straw or Tony Blair stood at the podium.  And this is the talent of Stanley Kubrick, his ability to build lasting images through his own visual sense.  Everything about his movies takes on a certain iconography, they not only represent the style of the times they where made and simultaneously dictate the style of when they are set, I mean, who wasn't just a bit let down by the year 2001's less than glorious look in comparison to Kubrick's vision, in the same way we are perturbed by A Clockwork Orange's dilapidated future.  Kubrick turns Burgess' themes into a full scale plan of attack, complimenting his message by utilizing all the camera and editing effects that went into the grandeur of 2001, but simplifying them to conform to both the idea of A Clockwork Orange, and the film's limited budget.  The use of slow-motion and ultra-speed works well, even if the laughable high-speed sex orgy looks like a throw back to the days of Benny Hill, and some people have trouble with the use of back projection and process shots, but all of these help build the world of the film, and help dictate the skewed perception of Alex (McDowell).  Both the character of Alex and the way in which McDowell portrays him is unbelievably complex, guiding the audience through this world with his narration, he makes the audience one of his `droogs' which means that we like Alex right from the start, his actions may appal us, but at this stage he's our only ally.  This is another one of Kubrick's trump cards, because if we like Alex, then we will feel for him as his victims take their revenge, and that's when the film has you, when you start to feel sympathy for this amoral character.`What's it going to be then?' is the future of A Clockwork Orange almost upon us, is Kubrick such a master film-maker that his films have the ability to predict time? Well, since none of us are now actually revolving in a space station to the haunting echo of `The Blue Danube' I would say no.  But it is impossible to watch the images of restrained violence and political corruption of A Clockwork Orange and not be drawn in, and more importantly not you leave feeling overwhelmed by the attention to detail and iconic, haunting images that Kubrick shows us.

His ability to move seamlessly from genre to genre, still covering the themes of man's metamorphosis, his place in the universe and his desire to choose between right and wrong, is something some filmmakers never manage.  If his previous film 2001 A Space Odyssey was his attempt to look at man's place in existence, the surely A Clockwork Orange is a look at man's place in society, not in any Ken Loach, lower class, upper class rivalry way, but in how man functions in society.  The question raised by Kubrick and writer Anthony Burgess is `if man cannot freely choose between right or wrong does he cease to be a man?'  Kubrick and Burgess seem to be in agreement, yes!  But whereas Burgess' novel showed us that, given time, the person will soon grow-up and decide for themselves, once and for all, what path to choose in life.  But because Kubrick missed the last chapter of the book, the film takes on an entirely different agenda. The year is now 2002, we have sailed through the year that Kubrick made famous with his watershed sci-fi picture, and we stand looking out at an uncertain future, and one thing that stands out, is the shocking similarities between the fantasy of A Clockwork Orange, and the reality of the everyday world.  Hooligans are everywhere, teenage louts that have elderly people too terrified to leave their homes after dark, our countries are run by lying, back-stabbing politicians who are always out for their own gain, and now scientists are looking into new treatments for the correction and rehabilitation of violent offenders.  It's not hard to see the pompous politicians of A Clockwork Orange and not subliminally think of Jack Straw or Tony Blair stood at the podium.  And this is the talent of Stanley Kubrick, his ability to build lasting images through his own visual sense.  Everything about his movies takes on a certain iconography, they not only represent the style of the times they where made and simultaneously dictate the style of when they are set, I mean, who wasn't just a bit let down by the year 2001's less than glorious look in comparison to Kubrick's vision, in the same way we are perturbed by A Clockwork Orange's dilapidated future.  Kubrick turns Burgess' themes into a full scale plan of attack, complimenting his message by utilizing all the camera and editing effects that went into the grandeur of 2001, but simplifying them to conform to both the idea of A Clockwork Orange, and the film's limited budget.  The use of slow-motion and ultra-speed works well, even if the laughable high-speed sex orgy looks like a throw back to the days of Benny Hill, and some people have trouble with the use of back projection and process shots, but all of these help build the world of the film, and help dictate the skewed perception of Alex (McDowell).  Both the character of Alex and the way in which McDowell portrays him is unbelievably complex, guiding the audience through this world with his narration, he makes the audience one of his `droogs' which means that we like Alex right from the start, his actions may appal us, but at this stage he's our only ally.  This is another one of Kubrick's trump cards, because if we like Alex, then we will feel for him as his victims take their revenge, and that's when the film has you, when you start to feel sympathy for this amoral character.`What's it going to be then?' is the future of A Clockwork Orange almost upon us, is Kubrick such a master film-maker that his films have the ability to predict time? Well, since none of us are now actually revolving in a space station to the haunting echo of `The Blue Danube' I would say no.  But it is impossible to watch the images of restrained violence and political corruption of A Clockwork Orange and not be drawn in, and more importantly not you leave feeling overwhelmed by the attention to detail and iconic, haunting images that Kubrick shows us.  Pop-art fantasy, or harsh political indictment, you decide.  10\/10   ","genre":"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"7 February 2002","score":"1 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":"  I'm sorry to say that this is Streisand's only really good movie. As a singular film, it's brilliantly constructed but when compared to all her other films, she only has this to really be proud of. Of course, being an ego-maniac, she's proud of all her work and that point is legitimate but it seems that she only really made films that she liked and the public and her peers gave her a lot of bad press for it. Don't get me wrong, though. I liked THE WAY WE WERE, YENTL, THE PRINCE OF TIDES and THE MIRROR HAS TWO FACES but FUNNY GIRL still to this day puts all those others to shame.Streisand capitalizes on her Broadway success of FUNNY GIRL to a perfect pitch with the film version. As Fanny Brice, I can't help but speculate that maybe the real Brice was born to be played by Streisand. Her Fanny is the portrayal of legendary material. When she comes out on stage at the finale of the film, she has so much emotion in her voice as she sings the Brice standard, MY MAN that you want to throw a bouquet of roses to her from your seat. During the course of the film, she is lovably comedic, genuinely sad in her low moments and shows the world that you don't have to be a great beauty to woo a good looking guy like Omar Sharif. Sharif is perfect as Nick Arnstein, Brice's first husband, a gambler whose luck doesn't hold out too long and it shows in Sharif's face when it happens. Walter Pidgeon is Florence Zeigfeld, the mogul of moguls who is only out for himself and his business where all his Folly girls are concerned. Kay Medford is her mother, Rose, (who was in the Broadway cast as her mother) the only one as the film opens that thinks Fanny would be a success in show business and received an Oscar nomination for her efforts. Jule Styne and Bob Merrill's unforgettable score is filled with great tunes like PEOPLE, DON'T RAIN ON MY PARADE and I'M THE GREATEST STAR. The one song from the stage version I wish they had kept in the film is CORNET MAN, replaced in the film by another Brice standard, I'D RATHER BE BLUE OVER YOU.

So people don't like the romance.  Rachel Weisz is in the romance!! For that reason, I'm more than willing to forgive them.The thing about the reviews I've read that almost makes me cry is when people call it boring.  Get knotted. Easy to see who's been watching too much American crap.  Seems some people can't take genuine suspense.The climax may be a tad implausable, but Ed Harris\/ Major Koenig does give a good display of dying like a man.
