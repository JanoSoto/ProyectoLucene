There were good intentions behind it and clearly some people with huge ability working on it.  The problem was that though it pretended it was treating the audience as an intelligent entity it took the typical Hollywood attitude of presuming that after all that we would not think about this film.The subject matter demands that as we leave the cinema we must think about the questions that have been asked of us.  To what extent is the media dominating or commanding our lives, do we live to see other's manipulated, is what around us real or a projection of our imaginations (however sick and warped that may be).  All very well, in fact excellent.  Too few films ask us to question the world around us.  But this is where we run into problems. You see, once you start thinking about the film you realise quite how many holes there are in the plot.Forgive me but I would presume that if a man is brought up in a fake world he would never know it was fake because it wasn't fake to him.  For Truman Burbank there can be no real world because in reality to him everything outside the TV studio which is his reality is fake.  Forgive me if I'm not explaining myself clearly enough.  Let me put it like this.  If all your life the rain simply followed you about and did not touch others would you question it.  The answer is no because that is the way things are for you.For Truman to one day start thinking this is a bit weird is not only unlikely and out of character, it could never happen.  Similarly he would not only not find it odd that people around were constantly advertising products, he would adopt that speech pattern himself.  Ultimately this would lead to the failure of the show itself because Truman would no longer be a real man to the viewers, instead he would be more like a trained monkey performing tricks.  But this is straying from the point (though it does demonstrate how examination of the film proves how badly thought through it is).Now onto a second complaint, why is it that the people around Truman have no feelings for him?  They have grown up with him, gone through life with him.  Yes, I accept he is their life line but I find it hard to believe that a man who has played his best friend for the best part of 30 years cannot care for him in the slightest.  Not even his 'parents' seem to have any real interest in his wellbeing, despite the fact that they have brought him up as if he were their own.  Are the makers of this film so cynical that they cannot give even the smallest amount of humanity to these characters?I have several other problems with the film, particularly the ending which was one of the most utterly contrived moments on film I have ever seen, as well as the lack of scope given to the show's creator, Christof (easily the best thing in it) and the unnecessary 'love interest.'  However, the major flaw of this film was the idea behind it.

But after he played the role of Eddie Felson, which got him a nomination, he became one of the most highly acclaimed actors in Hollywood.  So I guess you could say that to Paul Newman, The hustler represents the same thing The graduate represents to Dustin Hoffman.  It was his break-through movie and he was really good in it.  The hustler is also probably the best movie that director Robert Rossen has ever directed. He threw in together the ingredients of a film-noir and of a drama, mixed them together and created a classic.One night, Eddie Felson (Newman) decides to go to a pool-room one night to play the local champ, Minnesota Fats (Jackie Gleason).  He starts off pretty well and that frustrates Fats for he has never lost.  But as the hours pass by, Eddie starts drinking and becomes totally drunk and so Fats starts winning again until Felson is completely broke and must be carried out of the pool-room.Back in his town again, Eddie meets a woman called Sarah Packard (Piper Laurie) at the train station and falls in love with her.  She invites him over to her place and soon after, he moves in with her.  And so Eddie begins to settle down.  Then, one day he meets a man named Bert Gordon (George C. Scott) who tells Eddie that he will help him beat Minnesota Fats but in exchange, he wants 75% of everything Eddie makes hustling.  Eddie tries to negotiate with Bert about the size of the slice he is asking for but Bert is unflexable.  P***ed off, Eddie leaves the bar where he spoke with Bert telling him he doesn't need his help.Eddie goes to another bar and hustles a pool-player until the guy is flat broke.  But the guys in the bar despise hustlers and once Eddie has won and collected his money, the boys take him outside and break his thumbs so he won't be able to play pool again for a while.  When he gets back home, Sarah puts some bandages on his thumbs and he slowly begins healing.  It is then that he notices that his girlfriend has a serious drinking problem and that something has to be done.The rest of the movie is the best part of the whole thing.  Paul Newman, Jackie Gleason, Piper Laurie, and George C. Scott lead a terrific cast. Plus, Robert Rossen's choice of filming the movie in black and white made the movie all the more riveting and gripping.  But it's Jackie Gleason and George C.

If you are fortunate, the cinematic experience stays with you beyond the drive home after the credits have roled. The Hurricane is one of these rare films that manages to inspire, and affect the viewer in a manner far too  films fail to do. The cut I saw of Hurricane was missing the final credits and the colour had yet to be corrected, but the film was and is a masterpiece of storytelling by the acclaimed Norman Jewison. Like many of his films there is a deeply personal story to be told that has far reaching moral, political and social implications. Hurricane is the story of Rueben Hurricane Carter, a boxer wrongly imprissoned for a crime he didn't committ. The story unfolds from two  perspectives, Rueben's and from the perspective a boy named Lazarus, who in Carter, finds a hero in need of salvation. Denzel Washington is memorizing in his role as Hurricane, while the rest of the cast have risen to the occasion. Jewison has made perhaps his best film in decades and maybe his best ever. His committment to telling a good story (quoting last year's inspiring Oscar speech) is obvious, as his is committment to social consciousness. He uses the camera as a witness to brutality, history and to one man's salvation and redemption as he explores the life and circumstances that brought Carter and Lazarus together. Like movies such as Chariots of Fire, The Shawshank Redemption and Amistad, this film manages to involve the viewer on a highly personal level. We see Carter as a human being in circumstances that test him beyond reason. The scene where he tells his wife to leave him because he can't survive prison knowing she is waiting for him on the outside is powerful and moving. This film is worthy of Oscars in every way. As it stands, this film is a credit to the real Hurricane Carter and the journey he took, and to Lazarus who becomes the catalyst in bringing Carter to salvation. With a running time of almost two and a half hours, I suspect it will be a bit shorter when released, but hopefully Jewison and co. will leave most of it as is.
