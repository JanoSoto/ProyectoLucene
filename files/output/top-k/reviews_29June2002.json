There were a lot of really bad ones, but this tops them all, every single piece of garbage made that year. Everyone is saying this is art, it's a dreamlike masterpiece. I bet it doesn't make any sense because Lynch is just plain dumb. To start off, I want to say the acting is rock bottom, the plot, obviously non-exsistent, the cinematography uninspired, and seemingly good, but just ordinary work I've seen before that has been used better, not just because Lynch wants the film to look as weird as it can. Oh yeah, did I mention Lynch needs some direction courses?? People say this is reminiscent of Memento, in that it is confusing.....Memento used an original interesting plot device to get the viewer more interested to and to tell the story the best way it could. This is confusing just for the sake of being confusing. because there are a lot of people who see confusing things, and just say they like them. This isn't art, it's jumbled images thrown together for the sake of confusing you, with no reason. You want weird? Coen brothers do weird good. For example, this film leaves it up to the viewer to guess waht happens and doesn't, but not intentionally. It's just a scrambled mess of random images, most of which I laughed at they were so bad. Barton Fink uses a similar device. It leaves it all up to you what happened and doesn't, but it is for a reason, it is to move the story and to tell it well...The humour was bad, the technical aspects useless and unoriginal, as well as imitating work better done, the acting atrocious, the story...ugh, what story........all this movie offers is those very bad qualities, and 2.5 hours of throwing in the most ridiculous things just for the sake of being ridiculous, because Lynch is dried up....not that he ever had any talent.....grrrrrr!!!

He meets a beautiful girl Sarah (Mia Kirshner) and most likely falls in love with her. He starts to kill the guys who killed him and his son, and he does it with skill, as always. The film is set in some hellish netherworld where evil is everywhere, and also the criminals who killed our hero are very bad and evil, if not too believable all the time.The atmosphere of the film is occasionally pretty impressing and the presence of evil and feeling of depravity is powerful. Mia Kirshner's character brings some positivism to the story and she is among the few positive characters in this film. There are couple of great visuals and styles like fast editing and impressive cinematography techniques, and there is also dust and colorful smoke everywhere. These create great atmosphere for the film, and that's almost all this film managed to give me.The bad guys are bad and one is played by Iggy Pop. They should have been little more believable as now they become little irritating and stupid, as usually in these movies. Also, it would've been nice, if the film had had some spirit and message under its surface; now it's just empty revenge story without any point.The film is also often little slow moving and even boring. In fact, I felt myself almost uncomfortable during the last scene at the street when nothing seemed to happen or happen logically or satisfyingly. The film has too many easy conclusions and that makes the demanding viewer feel stupid and willing to stop the viewing. It is great that there are still those visual elements and angel like Mia that keep the film together and made it possible to watch without falling asleep.The tone of the film is pretty depressing as this tries to be as rough and violent as possible, but still I think the first film is far more impressive. Crow 2 is also dark, dirty and gritty but not as rough experience as all the adverts said on the DVD cover (not that I believed them, but still). However, I found these mentioned merits from this film and so give this 4\/10 and recommend mostly for fans of exploitation\/trash\/horror cinema; in other words for those who have used to seeing not so great movies and movies that most people cannot even sit through.

That doesn't mean that its bad.  In fact it is an excellent film.  It is not for the casual viewer though, and it certainly isn't Friday night popcorn fair. If thats what you want or expect, then leave it.  But if you can take it, its a very worth while watch.The film does start rather slowly.  It put me to sleep the first time I watched it.  But in the spirit of always finishing what I watch, I gave it a second chance.  Good thing.  Early in the movie, about the first half or so, there is some excellent editing.  It was excellent, but at the same time it was over used, and thankfully was almost completely left alone in the second half of the movie.  The image of the dilated pupil is a very common and strong one in the film.  I do feel, however, that some of the camera work did take away from the humanity a bit.  At times it was brilliant in that it disoriented the viewer and put us in the characters place, but at certain times I feel it was a little out of place.The acting is excellent, and extremely brave.  Burstyn, as mentioned many times before, is great.  The big surprise is Marlon Wayans.  Yes, he plays a drug addict again, but for once it wasn't in a spoof, and it wasn't for laughs.  It was nice to see the change from him.  Connelly is always good, so there's really nothing you need to say about her performance that wasn't expected anyway.The one thing I usually don't mention in a film is the score.  I'm usually indifferent to it.  In this film, however, the score was not only brilliant, but it was used to perfection and captured the tone of the movie.  It was necessary, and really heightened the downward spiral of all the characters.Speaking of the downward spiral, I feel this film captured that really well.  The beginning is slow, but with the characters lives beginning to spiral out of control, the pace gets quicker, much quicker.  The second half of the film is very fast and dark, and you can't take your eyes off of it.  I'm not sure if the pacing was deliberate, but if it was then it was executed to perfection.To sum up, this film isn't an easy watch, but its a good one.

The Bad Jim Carrey, a comedian I'd tired of.  I'm glad to say, the good was only slightly under par, and the bad was, refreshingly, not bad at all.The conflicts, the contrasts of this film are its true strength.  It's a clash of two American dreams.  In one, friends become names on a blacklist. Films are meant to fill pocketbooks.  Self-preservation is the bottom line. In the other, strangers are given the shirt off one's back.  Films fill the heart.  Sacrifice transcends all.  The incorporation of the red scare is what's most ironic and uplifting.  While Hollywood and Washington tear each other down in fear of Communism, we find a small town, ultimately far more American, and at the same time, very communal.  It seems to support itself not through profit but through helping hands & shoulders to lean on.  And yet it does this out of unity, mercy, patriotism--all of America's greatest ideals.Sure, like the small town Carrey's character washes up in, the film is a bit old-fashioned and cheesy, but these are simply its traits, not its flaws. In fact, the cynical criticism the film has received is not unlike the true antagonist of the film an America out of touch with itself.Darabont is no disappointment here.  Good visuals, a great cast doing a great job, and as is his trademark, a beautiful, uplifting look into years past.  I'm only sorry he didn't write the film as well.  Were he to, this film might've rivaled Shawshank as his greatest.As I said, I hadn't been fond of Carrey since the first couple of his mindless comedies (i.e. Ace Ventura).

Neither should you be swayed by the high ratings on IMDB, a ballot box which the Star Wars faithful readily stuff.  The bottom line is that this is not a terrible movie, but it doesn't even touch Return of the Jedi, let alone the other superior Star Wars movies.What we have here is a hastily written script that must conform to a pre-defined story line.  Take this exact script, change the names and the references so that it falls outside the realm of Star Wars, and you have a straight-to-video release that the Sci Fi network wouldn't even show.  But Lucas gave up on storylines long ago, figuring that one part Star Wars legacy plus two parts marketing hype plus three parts ILM wizardry equals one great movie.  Wrong.We have all these, of course.  We have Anakin and Obi Wan and Yoda and C3PO and R2D2 (who is becoming less cute and more annoying with each picture), each of whom is clumsily shoved into his role.  We have TV commercials and web sites and Happy Meals and enough toys, games, clothes, cups, etc to fill the Death Star three times over.  And we have Computer Generated Images. We have CGI galore!  We have spaceships and explosions and robotic armies and alien beings, all constructed solely from ILM pixels, out the wazoo.  But the whole is an empty product.  A soulless mess that looks more like a highly polished ripoff of other movies.For example, the first part of the movie contains a high speed chase through the hover traffic of Coruscant.  It looks as though Lucas lifted the traffic from The Fifth Element and the cityscape from Blade Runner (the cars are even referred to as spinners, a direct reference to BR).  There is one of the most lackluster, uninspired love stories ever filmed that could have been lifted from a hundred different movies.  And the final scene (the only redeeming scene in the whole movie) smacks of Gladiator.  Maybe this is Lucas' tip of the hat to Ridley Scott, or maybe it's just lazy filmmaking by a director who knows he's going to make his money back 3 times over.  I tend to side with the latter.Something else that Lucas just doesn't seem to realize is that special effects are there to accentuate a movie, not to substitute for the traditional conventions of plot, dialogue, and well-rounded characters. There is a reason that fireworks displays rarely go more than a few minutes. They are beautiful and exciting and awe-inspiring in short doses, but after an hour of floral shells, they all begin to look the same and your neck begins to hurt from craning skyward and you start to think about going home and hitting the sack.  The same can be said for movies.  The computer generated effects begin to wear thin, especially when there is anything but an interesting story behind it.  Lucas expects us to look at his handiwork and go, Ooooh! Cool! but we've seen a lot of this before, and after two hours it just ain't that cool anymore.One last thing, there is one more movie left before Star Wars is supposed to take place, but there are enough plot holes left to be filled by three more movies, which does not bode well for the next film.  I imagine 3\/4 of the last Star Wars movie will be spent bridging gaping chasms between Attack of the Clones and A New Hope with awkward plotting and cheap devices.  A perfect example is this  Anakin finds C3PO working on a moisture farm, the same farm that Luke is raised on.  In fact, Owen and Beru are there as well.  So how is it that 3PO doesn't recognize the farm when he and Artoo are sold in the original movie?  Better yet, how come Owen doesn't recognize 3PO when the jawas bring him by to be sold?

And I know that the whole side plot of his kid and the kidnapping were supposed to add to the complexity of the plot, but was it really necessary?

He created a world where the hero is flawed and happy endings don't and really can't exist. Dick's fantasy world is not far from reality.

But, I just can't understand how someone can butcher a story like this film did. Everything that made Dick's story different and exciting were cut out, replaced by special effects. My first gripe is Tom Cruise as the lead. He does not look like a middle aged, overweight balding man to me. And I know that the whole side plot of his kid and the kidnapping were supposed to add to the complexity of the plot, but was it really necessary?

I really haven't seen bad film from him. Brother is set in America as Kitano's character travels to US from Japan, and starts new life there. He has his half brother living there so he has a place to live in. Soon he starts to have new friends and become a leader and member of their new gang\/yakuza. Violent confrontations with other gangs and mafia take place as everyone is willing to use violence and vengeance in order to settle things.Brother has all the usual and breath taking Kitano elements we've learnt to see. The flashbacks of events, long shots without editing, character's faces that say more things than 100 words, images of beauty and peace and wry humor, among others elements. The main theme in Brother is loyalty and friendship that becomes even love. The last scene is fantastic and very unusual for Kitano; never has he underlined his message this clearly as he does in Brother's finale. It is so purifying scene and really makes the point clear, but still, most people don't understand anything about Kitano's films, because they are so personal and different compared to Western mainstream films.Brother is like a combination of Violent Cop and Hana'Bi. It has Violent Cop's bleakness and Hana-Bi's beauty and sadness. Brother is very sad film at times, and only last scene gives something really positive and also optimistic. Hana-Bi is very sad and beautiful film, and these two, Brother and Hana-Bi, have much in common. Both were composed by the same guy, Joe Hisaishi, who did fantastic job especially in Hana-Bi and also Sonatine. Violent Cop is very gritty and also pessimistic film, and is very similar to Brother in its overall look of life. Both films are also very calm and restrained and not as visually stunning as Hana-Bi and Sonatine. All these films are masterpieces of Japanese cinema, and it is interesting to see how Kitano mixes elements from his other films and creates always something new and immortal. The violence is very brutal and challenging but definitely not gratuitous or exploitative. Kitano's violence is always very symbolic and sudden, and not necessarily realistic. These films analyze many aspects of violence as a tool of communicating for weak souls. Kitano definitely doesn't justify violence or praise it; he just shows what most people or film makers probably wouldn't even dare to think of, and once the viewer may be thinking yeah, kill that b****rd! the film turns against the viewer and makes him think what he just said and accepted. The more emotionally challenging film is, the more noteworthy it becomes and Kitano's films are perfect examples of that. Brother is also occasionally filled with Kitano's wry and personal humor which was at its taunting in his Boiling Point. Brother has many great personal touches of its creator and every time Kitano's character laughs here, there is something very twisted in his mind and going on. Brother is not thoroughly cynical film after all, and these humoristic touches only add to the great purification of the last scene. The film criticizes yakuza also pretty much and with the director's personal style, as there are numerous scenes involving yakuza rites and codes of honor. Also, there is a great scene involving basketball and yakuza member's attempt to get the ball and be king of the game and have a feeling of being somebody. Boiling Point has plenty of these scenes and tones as the gangsters play tough guy with big guns and thus try to get acceptance. These films really should make yakuzas ask themselves, why?I am totally stunned by cinematic styles Kitano uses in his films. The editing and photography is so incredibly smooth and stylish, and creates the atmosphere of the film. The faces are among the most important details in Kitano's films as there are so many things to be read from characters' faces. For example, there is awesome scene in Brother's beginning where Kitano sees the death of a yakuza boss. Kitano has totally unique sense of beauty, sensitivity and expressing emotions that has no comparison from other films. His character doesn't talk too much in his films, but anytime he says something, he says and expresses more than thousand words. His films are immortal and can be seen over and over again, and still they have plenty of things to offer for the lover of this unique cinema.Brother is among Kitano's greatest films and I definitely give this ten out of ten, because there are absolutely no negative aspects in this film, and this proudly stands in Takeshi Kitano's filmography.

We know there will be an opening murder sequence, all the survivors will have a reunion, an investigation will ensue, people will die, and the killer will be revealed at the end. Sure it sounds tired by now, but at least we know what to expect so we can just lay back and watch it happen and have a great time. Scream 3, with its humor and great performances by Parker Posey and Courteney Cox-Arquette is the sequel where you get to have the most fun. It's got its moments of horror and plenty of scary parts, but above all it sort of winks at itself as if saying Remember all those other series we made fun of for making pointless sequels...well guess what we did.... It's not taken seriously, which is something this series needed to do after Scream 2, poke fun at itself. Several moments in the movie are so much fun, like when the killer enters a room full of people and they all scream and run around like idiots. No one is ever alone in this movie, they always have a partner to scream and yell with because this time the Ghost doesn't worry about groups. It's just so funny. Parker Posey will run into a closet, someone else will take off for the hallway, Gale will throw a lamp while they all scream like madmen. Definitely the funnest one since the first. Several times in the movie these characters that were once so wise will split up and go off to look for someone alone, one of the big no-no's in a horror movie. It may sound dumb, but since when did that horror movie knowledge get them anywhere, people still died because the killer knows it, too. There also isn't a lot of trilogys suck action going on here, like they did with sequels in Scream 2. By this time the creators know that any movie seriously focusing on a masked killer and Sidney Prescott again is bound to suck, so why not have fun with it? This movie doesn't care about horror cliches and doing the same things we learned not to do in the first two films, and it's fun. There are several flashbacks to the first Scream, done in replicas of the Woodsboro set for the movie Stab 3, now a trilogy itself. The killer(s) go all the way back to the beginning of the series, a nice surprise even though the trailers promised a big revelation. It's like the creators knew exactly how to throw the audience off by making them think there was something big that was coming in the end and then dropping them on their heads with nothing. It was a good trick. Set in Hollywood this time, it feels like this series has gone full circle. From small-town Woodsboro to Hollywood, this series is very fun. After the first Scream was blamed for making all horror movies look stupid and incompetent, making lots of people hate it, this movie goes and does a look what we did thing by turning into the exact sort of thing the characters in the first two Screams would scoff at. This film was the best direction this series could have taken after the endless rip-offs. And if it sounds like this is all fun and games, think again. There are serious moments and people do die. It's just touched with a hint of comedy. They say this is the last part of a trilogy. Dimension Films may realize these movies pull in a lot of money and forget the whole trilogy thing for another installment. I really hope this series remains a trilogy because three is enough, but I do want another Scream movie. Maybe they can do a new beginning thing with all new characters and it wouldn't technically be a part of the trilogy. This movie wraps up these character's story lines well and they should end it here. But I would love to see another sequel with all new players.

I heard Kubrick was going to direct the film by himself, but because of his death, Spielberg got the job. But the truth is that Kubrick called Spielberg to ask him if he wanted to be the director. You don't often receive a call from a brilliant director offering you a film... but you won't probably have the luck to call Spielberg in order to direct your movie! -). Anyway, on with the comment!Before watching AI, you must realize it's a Kubrick's movie conducted by Steven Spielberg. So it will be a mixture between The Shining and ET, but in my opinion it's more a Spielberg's film than a Kubrick's.The story is quite interesting in the future, the ice caps have melted and the sea level has increased a lot, leaving the cities near the shore under the water. The human population has been reduced, so the natural resources. Strict birth controls have been established in order to survive against the hunger. That's why robots become so important in human society.The robot technology has reached so unbelievable levels that scientists can create a synthetic humanoid, physically and mentally like a human, but with some problems expressing emotions. But then, a group of doctors start a project in order to create a child robot with the ability to love. And that's when David appears.I'm not going to tell all the movie until the end, but with these introduction, you should get a picture of what the film is about AI tells the story of the love between a boy and his mother, so be prepared for a really emotional movie. And don't expect an action futuristic thrill or you'll get disappointed...The acting is incredible. You have Haley Joel Osment playing as David, the child-robot, who steals all the attention of the movie and leads the film with an incredible performance. Then, as David's counterpart, you have Gigolo Joe, performed by Jude Law, who also does an incredible performance of his character. The acting is remarkable along all the movie. The evolution of David through the story is really good in the beginning he acts like a robot, but in the end it's almost human.The SFX are brilliant all the robots, Rouge City... Special mention to the reality of Teddy, the robot toy which follows David through all the movie. ILM does it again with this film.Ok, the film seems brilliant. Then why the bad reviews? People would say a list of cons the film is very slow, very long, and very strange... Osment overracts in some scenes... They should have cut out the last 30 minutes..., What's the point of that aliens in the end of the film?!.... I'm not going to argue if some people didn't like the film. They have their opinion. I admit this film is difficult to assimilate, not popcorn summer movie. But FYI, the supposed aliens are not THEY ARE ROBOTS, for god sake! They are even like the symbol of the robot company...I was going to say If you like ET or The Shining, you'll like this one, but it's not true it's a totally unexpectable film, full of emotion, special effects, all conducted with the incredible Spielberg, but with Kubrick behind all. If you want to see a genuine Spielberg's creation, see Minority Report.Anyway, a really worth look!

The FX are very good; I  liked the big dumb troll. The real and imaginary scenery excellent, and I liked the gate 'nine and three-quarters' transition at the train station, not just the running through the wall, but the change in setting from the business-like, sterile Muggle-world to the character charm - in more ways than one - of the wizard world. The author's  stipulation to use mostly UK cast  permitted North American viewers to meet seasoned actors not usually seen here. The likeable cast of young actors appeared wooden at times. Rupert Grint was the most relaxed in his role, could even be Oscar material.Some scenes dragged such as near the end when Hermione speechifies something about brains aren't everything. The veteran actors were better able to carry the sometimes weak dialogue (e.g. Richard Harris as Dumbledore, explaining how mother's love protected Harry from the hands of evil, by a lesser talent would have come off as trite). To someone who hasn't read the book, some aspects of the movie will seem pointless but it does stand alone quite well. I purposely did not read the first HP book beforehand.Extraordinary details seem what you might expect, such as the living paintings, and the lady-ghost writing at a desk in one of the classroom scenes. I would like a brocade hat like Prof. Dumbledore wears at the closing banquet!More highlights Alan Rickman's threatening yet surprisingly sympathetic Professor of the Dark Arts; Maggie Smith's perfect schoolmarm demeanor; Sean Biggerstaff as the young bloke-ish sportsman.
