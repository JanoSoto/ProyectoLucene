[{"date":"18 November 2002","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"       Shrek had everything, humor, adventure, romance, and it was also good for all ages. Little kids could enjoy this along with teens and      s. Some of the humor was above the younger viewers head and the      s found these parts funny. Shrek (while many aren't) was a good animated film, and you don't find a lot of good animated movies. Classics like this come once every couple of years. (Some animated classics include Beauty and the Beast and Monsters Inc.)     The only thing I have against Shrek is the fact they are making a sequel. The first one was very, very good, but many movies that were good the sequels... well they sucked. This does not happen in all cases though. Some (i.e. Spy Kids 2 The Island of Lost Dreams and The Godfather 2) pulled of a box office hit sequel.     If you have never seen this movie you should check it out. I give it a whole hearted 9.5\/10!
