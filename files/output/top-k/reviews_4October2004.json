One family the Hoods are about to get divorced. Mr. Hood has an affair with his neighbor Janey Carver who is married to Sandy Carver who is a successful businessman who is often in business trips and rarely home. Elena Hood seems to be in search of some counseling both psychiatric and spiritual to help her breaking family but Mr. Hood is not supportive of it. Elena's trust in her husband weakness when they go to a key party because she suspects that her husband is having an affair with their neighbor. She seems to get back at him by also participating in the key party and leaving with her neighbor Mr. Carver. While they are at the key party Wendy Hood and Jim Carver get undressed and sleep together and Mickey Hood goes outside during an Ice Storm and is fatally electrocuted by a fallen electric pole. Also Paul Hood, the eldest son of the Hoods, goes to New York to meet with his crush from High School, Libbets Casey, and comes back home to find his father crying in realization of his bad example as a parent. This is not the type of movie I would choose to see. However, after analyzing it, I like the logic and message that it gave. I would not say I related with the way the children acted in the film, but I could understand why they acted the way they did. When I was small, my parents would work a lot and that kept us separated; just like the kids in the film. But even though when there is distance between parents and children, the kids often follow their parent's behavior and example. They can even pay the consequences of their parent's actions. In the movie Wendy was very sexually open by exploring her opposite sex. Her parents did the same by being unfaithful and by participating at a key party. This makes it clear that Wendy's behavior came from her father for instance, as the film showed that he was having an affair with his neighbor. Also Wendy and her mother Elena pick pocketing was shown in the movie to be related. Even though the daughter was not aware of her mother's behavior, she picked up the same habit of steeling. This film has made me reflect upon how family stability reflects upon the stability of society as well. Society starts at home, bad family ties creates a bad society. Throughout history there has been a correlation between bad morals and failed in life. Not only does the movie portray the view of a ruptured family but also of a ruptured society. By showing Wendy's disapproval of the current president Nixon it reflected the type of disloyal society of the time. Nixon being a symbol of a leader who is trusted by a nation but whose disloyalty creates a breakdown of trust in society. This also shows another influential part of the movie, about how bad leaders can cause chaos; as Nixon did for the United States with his corruption, Ben also with his unfaithfulness was a bad role model in his family creating a home with lack of morals. There seems to be no indication of good parenting or a good influential role model in this film. And because of this Wendy is so sexually explicit and Mickey died for not having any parental supervision. Children suffer when there is a lack of parental guidance and example. If parents do not understand their position and role in their family, it will be hard for them to raise sane children. If parents lack morals and don't maintain good communication with their children, children will be raised with a lack of morals and a sense of confusion, because they don't have a sense of security from their distant parents. Both families in the film had unsupervised children who were not mentally and emotionally sane. Wendy in the midst of puberty was already very sexually open; and even though her mother noticed it she didn't seem to care or teach her daughter good morals. Mickey was in fascination with 'molecules' and went out late at night during an ice storm and died from lack of parental supervision. And Mickey's brother who is probably less than ten, also had is own fascination with explosives, and could have almost killed himself while he was blowing up his airplanes with dynamite at home when he was alone. If their parents were conscious of their roles and practiced good parenting by communicating, giving emotional security to their children and keeping good family ties, 'The Ice Storm' would have been a whole other story. Even though both families had money and could offer their children many material things, money could not and does not buy good parenting.

The film is about a rebellious young Hasidic women Sonia Horowitz, Renee Zeilweger,who emotionally destroys almost every one that she comes in contact with from the Grand Rebbe Moshe, Jon Randolph, to her helpless husband Mendel, Glenn Fitzgerald, with her ideas about life and religion. Sonia does this to the point where she's practically run out of the neighborhood of Boro Park by the very people, the Hassidim, who at first welcomed and accepted her as one of their own. Even her own mother not offering Sonia any support or allowing her to stay at her home when she phoned for help. Actress Renee Zeilweger is very believable as a Hasidic woman at first but when we see her change and become somewhat of a free soul she become a bit ridicules. The only logical explanation I can come to for her actions is that the birth of her son Shimmie and the stress of taking care of him under the difficult conditions of the Hasidic life-style. A life-style that pushed her off the deep end and caused her to have a serious emotional breakdown. What surprised me about Sonia is that you see her in the beginning of the movie as a little girl and she seemed as detached from religion, Jewish or otherwise. How could she then as a young women marry a Hasidic man, Mendel Horowitz, and not know what would be in store for her? Mendel is a fine teacher and Torah scholar at the local Yeshiva, Jewish religious school,and is looked highly upon by his students and friends to become a major leader in the Hasidic community. It's Sonia's rebellious that slowly pulls him down to the point where he becomes a basket case. Mendel becomes so depressed that he's almost at the point later in the film to be committed. There's also a sub-plot in the movie involving Mendel's older brother Sender, Christopher Eccleston. Sender at first gives Sonia a job at his jewelry establishment in both Boro Park and the 47th street diamond district in midtown Manhattan but also forces himself on her. Sader has a secret affair with Sonia to the point where he keeps a secret apartment in Manhattan to continue it. Sonia proves to be a real tough cookie in dealing with crooks and chiselers in the jewelry and diamond business. Confronting them with their illegal practices and forcing them to give her as much as an 80% discount on their products, the real stuff not the phony baloney, or else she'll report them to the authorities. Sonia later develops a relationship with Ramon Garcia, Allen Payne, who worked for one of these jewelry crooks Hrundi Kapoor, Faran Tahir. Romans work really impressed Sonia and later falls in love with to the shock and horror of her Hasidic friends and neighbors. It's very hard at first to muster up any sympathy for Sonia since not only does she cheat on her husband with Ramon not Sender who she was in no way in love with. It was Sender not her who started and continued the affair. Also Sonia's her love for her son rang a bit hollow as she neglected little Shimmie to the point where he had to stay with one of her Hasidic neighbors Rachel, Julianna MaGulies. With Sonia never at home to care for him. Mendel was also out in him being too busy teaching and studying the Mishna, Jewish holy Books, at the synagogue. This gave Mendel almost no time at all to look after Shimmie at the same time putting the entire care and attention of the infant all on poor Sonia's shoulders. With all this going on you can fully understand the situation that she found herself in and how it completely overwhelmed her.Mendel came across far more sympathetic in the movie only because he actually seemed more destroyed emotionally by what was happening. Mendel came across as almost being Brain-dead or unconscious which didn't gain him too many points with the audience. To Mendel's credit in the end he did pull himself together and took Shimmie home and cared for him by himself without the help of the almost always absent Sonia. It was also Mendel, together with Sonia, who in the end of the movie almost came to an understanding about the difficulties of their marriage and how he realized, like she did, that their marriage was at an end. Both agreeing to both go their separate ways. Parting with Sonia Mendel gave her a present a ruby, Sonia's birth stone, that he forgot to buy her for her birthday since he forgot her birthday. The movie A Price Above Rubies wasn't as bad as most reviews on it say it is. The acting was much better then average and there were times where it hit you right in the heart and moved you. The film was just too over-the-top in regard to the supposed excesses of the Brooklyn Hasidic community it its treatment of a somewhat wayward, from their strict religious practices, young woman. Interesting at first but after a half hour or so it just bogged down to where it became an unending TV sitcom about a dysfunctional American family but without any humor or laughs in it.

However, the movie in which she had an amazing performance was far from an amazing movie. While the cast of actors in the movie are terrific and the production value with the costumes are great, where was the story? Call mew crazy, but I am one of 99% of the world who does not know who Mrs. Parker was. Therefore, I was left in the dark with everyone else who still did not know who they heck she was by the end of the movie. OK, she was a great writer and poet, but why couldn't the story better portray that and tells the audience more about her accomplishments. Watching a table full of fast talking know it alls was far from enjoyable. Jennifer Jason Leigh built and built on her character but eventually tipped over when the audience stopped caring what the movie was about. If this is about her and her failed attempt at love, this was a slow melodrama that left the audience wanting more of a plot. If this was the true story of a woman that was before her time, the move was far from completion as the movie only scratched the surface at what her life was about. The ending credits did nothing for Mrs. Parker's legacy. It's nice that the movie didn't show one African American, but Mrs. Parker leaves her estate to Martin Luther King Jr.. Was that just thrown in there to give Mrs. Parker some credit for spending most of her life depressed and writing about it? Don't get me wrong, Jennifer Jason Leigh did a great job, but she received little credit for her role because the movie itself sunk with or without her performance.

The Tenenbaums are a dysfunctional family &#150; the parents have been separated for decades, and Royal (Gene Hackman) is a disbarred attorney who has long since moved out of the family's enormous house (in an unnamed city of course). The children, all geniuses and overachievers in their own way, are then raised by Etheline (Angelica Houston), an archeologist. Chas (Ben Stiller) is a financial wizard, Margot (Gwyneth Paltrow), is adopted and was a published playwright at 11, and Richie (Luke Wilson) is a tennis prodigy. We are provided the family history at the start of the film, then are introduced to the family 22 years later. Chas is still a financial wizard, but, having lost his wife in a plane accident is now the paranoid father of two small sons. Margot is married to Raleigh St. Clair (Bill Murray, who is basically Anderson's muse), is depressed and hasn't written in years, and Richie, after having a nervous breakdown on the tennis court a couple of years earlier is traveling the world by boat. Still hanging around is Eli (Owen Wilson) a long-time family friend from across the street who is now a literature professor and successful novelist. Etheline is being wooed by her accountant, Henry (Danny Glover) and when Royal gets wind of this, he embarks on a bid to win his family back after not speaking with them for years.Wes Anderson has an unusual style of film-making that has been static throughout his career. Highly theatrical, almost in the style of a play, he presents the story of the Tenenbaums to us as if it were taken directly from a book, so much so that if you were to read the few sentences that are visible in the book that accompanies the beginning of each 'chapter', you would see that the written narrative follows the action to the letter. Anderson favors primary colors, and characters that are identifiable by very distinct appearances. Chas and his sons have their red track suits they always wear, Margot wears the clip in her hair, Izod dresses from the 80's and dark eyeliner surrounding her eyes, Richie wears the sweatband around his head, Eli is in cowboy gear and Raleigh looks like a Freud knockoff. One of the results is that there are varying degrees of recognition for the actor in 'real life'. When seeing Raleigh, it's easy to forget that it is Bill Murray, and Margot for that matter is so different from how we are used to seeing Paltrow. Certainly, this is Anderson's intent. Anderson also favors point of view shots, characters looking directly at or addressing the camera, and is also one of the few modern masters in the use of music. The soundtrack to 'The Royal Tenenbaums' features some classic songs (Ruby Tuesday, Hey Jude) but also has some obscure tracks that are bizarre and fit into the scene beautifully.'The Royal Tenenbaums' has a phenomenal cast, and all of the actors are excellent in the film. I get the strong impression that, since Anderson isn't a mainstream film director, A-list actors sign up to work for him because of his alternative vision and his obvious talent. When I watched this film recently, I asked the two friends I saw it with what they thought, and they both said 'It was quirky'. Since they are both film lovers, I was a little disappointed in this narrow (and obvious) assessment of the film at first. Upon further reflection, however, I realized that they both come from households that have parents who are still together. Coming from a 'broken home' I can relate to the high dysfunction of the Tenenbaums as an adult and embrace the story beyond the presentation, despite its highly stylized format. 'The Royal Tenenbaums' is a brilliant film that is both emotional and eye-catching, and truly cements Wes Anderson as an exciting and talented filmmaker. 9\/10--Shelly  ","genre":"Comedy, Drama"},{"date":"4 October 2004","score":"138 out of 185 people found the following review useful","review":"  With 'The Royal Tenenbaums', Wes Anderson turns his lens to the American family, warts and all.

The term, 'male gaze', is used to describe the way a male stares at the female image. It starts out on a rooftop. The rooftop scenes are similar in shots to another of Hitchcock's films 'To Catch a Thief'. The audience is shown how 'Scottie', his real character name is John Ferguson portrayed by James Stuart, is stricken with acrophobia that gives him vertigo. The trauma of hanging for dear life from a gutter at the top of a building and the policeman that tries to save him falling to his death is detrimental to James Stuarts character. As a detective, Gavin will later use this to his advantage. In the later 50's when the movie was made, sexuality was more conservative than today's standards. Sex was more of a behind closed doors mentality. This film was one of the films that made a turning point in discussing sexuality in society from a conformist standpoint; sex was starting to become more open to discuss in the major cities. These boundaries where not especially broken in film. For instance, any husband and wife scene in the bedroom were two single beds, the actors were fully dress, and if the woman was to get into bed the husband could not sit on the bed. Women were exploited sexually in humor. Having funny mentalities, but adding obsession to the table was taboo. Women's sexual ownership was not explored in a dark manner till this movie. Scottie asks how Midge's love life is. She replies, 'normal.' Gender roles are even switched when Midge is working and Scottie is lying at her feet. Scottie also falls into Midge's arms, portraying Scottie as the weaker sex between them. Scottie also treats Midge like a pal, or another guy, rather than a woman of interest. Later in the movie, the long dramatic shot of Gavin's wife, Madeleine at Ernie's restaurant and the shot of how Scottie is looking at her for that moment is considered the 'male gaze'. And then there's the coy game we play, Scottie uses this to not get caught looking at her in the traditional male act. A strong example of 'voyeur' is brought up in the film with him spying on the wife, for example, looking through a cracked door with just an eyeball and a shadow of a face looking at you. Another image is of Scottie walking around a corner at the Golden Gate bridge, Madeleine is by the water and Scottie is starring at her again is a gaze.'Male gaze' is considered ogling. Ogling is 'looking at somebody for sexual enjoyment or showing sexual interest, having a prolonged flirtatious or desirous look at somebody'. There are specific poses that enhance this gaze or ogle. One example of this gaze is when we see Scottie playing naive and ogles at a brassiere. The deliberate sexual condensations that a military man designed it in his spare time implies that the brassiere designer enjoys testing the product, having many women try the brassiere on and off, making for a lot of late and sleepless nights for the designer. Giving the impression that he works and plays at the same time. Sex sells and is one thread that ties the human race together. To have beauty is a form of power over someone. That is what makes people want to be you and or like you. It is a feeling of empowerment over woman, and to look at woman as a sense of property and a piece of meat. The director is trying to seduce the view using Kim Novak as Madeleine to entice Scottie and the male target audience, and this form of voyeurism will never disappear in the media. There are sexy, nasty, naughty and innocent positions looks that immediately entice the male viewing audience to start to ogle at woman. Alfred Hitchcock was aware of these positions and using to his advantage, he had Madeleine\/Judy portray, sexy and innocent, by having Madeleine\/Judy shake her hips more walking down the street, standing in the wind to having her hair move and glisten in the wind and shaking her hair when she is in Scottie's arms on the mountain side. And in that same scene she is wearing white to portray her innocence. Throughout the movie there are shot revolving around a ruby necklace with a low cut neckline dress showing a lot of skin. All the shots had the same angle, capturing the neck, chest and cleavage. This was a close-up ogling shot if I ever saw one. In other scenes Alfred Hitchcock would have the actress Kim Novak wear a gray suit to give her a mysterious look, though gray is always a bad color for blonde's. Sexual advances are thought of only having the time of day. Most men have the fear of missing out and use this to entice the eyes. Men are stimulated & aroused visually and not emotionally like woman are. It is easier to stimulate a man's libido that a woman's. The male gaze is trained and honed since we were wee little lades. Men are the hunters and woman are the prey. In this sexual lustful gaze men revert to primal thought. These images instigate dreams and fantasies of woman will enter ones head and a sense of gratification come over the viewer. The words 'only if' come to mind in this gaze. Phrases like 'smack that ass', 'faster harder', 'shake that ass' refer to positions sexual movements. A beady-eyed man will undergo a tunneling effect with a 'male gaze', soaking up all the glory of what the man looking at. Tasting the sweet nectar from your eyes. Women were considered to be the property of men not to long ago and some men still have this same mentality today.

This movie has great (or at least good) potential as a comedy &#150; but is ruined by a grating lead performance, poor scriptwriting, and increasingly lame jokes. Worst of all, however, is the totally inept direction &#150; had the film been delivered to better talent, it could have easily been Adam Sandler's best comedy. It's one of his worst, simply because the amateur handling is similar to that of worse duds like Battlefield Earth. Sandler's Billy Madison wasn't anything special but at least it was adequately made.No faults in the cast. With performances and cameos including Patricia Arquette, Harvey Keitel, Quentin Tarantino, Rodney Dangerfield, Dana Carvey, Jon Lovitz, Reese Witherspoon, Henry Winkler, Ozzy Osbourne, Rob Schneider, Michael McKean, Robert Smigel, Regis Philbin and Carl Weathers, the film's flaw is its script &#150; the talented actors are required to mutter extremely contrived dialogue, and most of the time they do so quite embarrassingly. Watching Keitel is painful &#150; he's not even trying. You know you're in trouble when a film's best performance is by Quentin Tarantino &#150; in this case, as a blind preacher who has a habit of injuring himself (every time we see him it's a new brace, bandage, etc.).The plot is basically this titular character 'Little' Nicky (Sandler) is the son of Lucifer (Keitel), whose other two sons leave hell in search of fun 'up north' in New York City. Their journey magically breaks the gates of hell, or something, and as a result this causes the Devil to wither away. Nicky is left as the only possible source of salvation, having to travel north, bring his evil brothers back and save his dying father (how does someone in hell die? Don't ask me.).The movie has a few clever gags for movie buffs &#150; Elephant Man and Scarface references being the best, if not very subtle. The film's problem is that it quickly runs out of steam &#150; it's a one-trick pony and is only able to sustain its screwball antics for so long until it becomes a chore to sit through.One thing I have to give credit to Sandler for is that, although his comedies may not be perfect, most of the time they are somewhat amusing and aren't as commercially sloppy as Little Nicky. By that, I mean that this movie is a by-the-numbers Hollywood product &#150; it moves from Point A to Point B to Point C, introducing all the typical clichés of the genre. Sandler's comedies have always been weak in terms of romantic subplots &#150; the tacked-on relationship in Happy Gilmore was laughable, and Madison's was even worse. Didn't matter much because the films relied on jokes. Not here. Jokes are rare. The romantic subplot is the worst so far in any of his films &#150; I felt sorry for Arquette, and I was disturbed by how shallow her character was written. (She meets Nicky &#150; a muttering, mumbling, evil idiot &#150; in New York, treats him nice, goes out on a date, and then he swears at her and makes obscene gestures and tells her that he's the spawn of Satan and she gives a cute smile and goes on a magical Satan-powered flight across the city with him. Absolutely pathetic.)Characters are handled as throwaways &#150; Dangerfield's potentially-hilarious performance is watered down and never given full opportunity, showing up once and a while to add a few laughs to a flat sequence. Keitel's performance is weak and Sandler has once again created a grating voice &#150; Little Nicky sounds just like his geeky character from SNL who would show up on Weekend Updates to give music reports. A better comedian might really find a character to play underneath the surface &#150; Sandler isn't able to because, to be fair, he isn't much of a comedian. As a result his performance is painfully blunt &#150; about as subtle as a hammer over the head. Instead of playing a wacky, annoying person in his next movie, why doesn't he just play himself?

You know you're in trouble when a film's best performance is by Quentin Tarantino &#150; in this case, as a blind preacher who has a habit of injuring himself (every time we see him it's a new brace, bandage, etc.).The plot is basically this titular character 'Little' Nicky (Sandler) is the son of Lucifer (Keitel), whose other two sons leave hell in search of fun 'up north' in New York City.

By that, I mean that this movie is a by-the-numbers Hollywood product &#150; it moves from Point A to Point B to Point C, introducing all the typical clichés of the genre.

The romantic subplot is the worst so far in any of his films &#150; I felt sorry for Arquette, and I was disturbed by how shallow her character was written.

Absolutely pathetic.)Characters are handled as throwaways &#150; Dangerfield's potentially-hilarious performance is watered down and never given full opportunity, showing up once and a while to add a few laughs to a flat sequence.

So then, why is this film one of the most important and influential that cinema has to offer? Why does it have legions of fans, why has it become one of the most imitated films in cinema history? Because it's absolute pure, balls to the wall, uncompromising, unflinching horror - that's why! In fact, it may even be the 'purest' horror film ever made. There is nothing here but horror, and that gets a big thumbs up from me. And every other horror fan, I'm sure. The film, loosely based on the American serial killer, Ed Gein, features very little in the way of gore, but masses and masses in the way of suspense. At times, like the part of the film that sees Leatherface chase our heroine, chainsaw in hand through the woodlands of the area that surrounds the killer's house, the suspense is so tense that it's hard to watch. The sequence itself actually doesn't last long, but because it's so nail-biting, it feels like it lasts for hours. The films plays like this for the majority of it's running time; it doesn't show the chainsaw tearing flesh, but it does show you the build up, and, at times, brief imagery depicting what is happening; and that's all we need. The film is very brutal and it is not an experience that you will easily forget; the scene that sees the almost deceased grandfather suck on a young girls finger is an image that I personally will never forget. The majority of the characters in The Texas Chain Saw Massacre aren't worth mentioning, with two exceptions; Franklin and, of course, Leatherface. Franklin is, probably, one of the most annoying characters ever created in cinema. So annoying, in fact, that you'll be over the moon when he gets it. In stark contrast to Franklin, Leatherface is the absolute star of the show. Like the film itself, Leatherface is brutal. From the ungraceful way that he moves, down to the cold and animalistic way that he behaves, Leatherface is the epitome of terror. When coupled with the movie's weapon of choice, and my personal favourite - the chainsaw, it takes the character into a whole different dimension. The chainsaw is a piece of kit that takes on a life of it's own when it's engine is revved. It screams terror, and Tobe Hooper obviously knew this from the callous way that the weapon is brought to life in this film. There isn't much else to say about this film that hasn't been said a million times before, so I guess all there is left is - watch it!

I did not realize that she was so capable of bringing this character to life. Her counterpart, the illustrious 'Wolf', played by 80s child Keifer Sutherland, is yet another powerful force in this film. The two of them nearly carry this film on their shoulders. This is one of those perfect examples of a film that did not have much publicity after its release, but has since then obtained 'cult' status through avid viewer's word of mouth. This is definitely a film for all movie critics, film buffs, and fanatics to gaze at just once. I know there were some poor reviews when it was first released, but I am sure that a second viewing would bring this gem back to life.I would also like to add that director Matthew Bright is a film genius.

This is a very good film indeed. A must see, one of the few this year. Ignore the fact it falls apart at the ending.On the face of it the story is a fairly standard conspiracy thriller, with Nicolas Cage as brash, slightly manic, corrupt cop Ricky Santoro. During the course of a championship boxing fight, Ricky witnesses the assassination of the head of military procurement who is under the protection of Ricky's oldest friend, Gary Sinese as Kevin Dunn. As time passes - and the film is shot almost exclusively in real time - it slowly dawns on Ricky that his oldest friend has betrayed him, and is deeply implicated in the killing. Fairly predictable stuff, but the execution of it almost defies description.The story unfolds by way of exceptionally clever use of camera angles, so we first see Ricky's view of the truth, then a construct of a lie offered as truth, and finally the real truth about events. The obsession with the use of the camera as a dispassionate witness becomes apparent in the opening scenes, which are breathtakingly shot in one single take, done on hand-held steady cam, lasting the best part of twenty minutes. Ricky is seen, gold mobile phone glued to his ear, making his way through the crowds at the boxing match, laying bets, chasing a defaulting petty crook, calling his wife, calling his mistress, hitting on a cheerleader, trying to meet the champ, and finally plonking his Hawaiian shirted noisy self next to the starchy and restrained Admiral Dunn. Dazzlingly well done.Art imitates art even further when Ricky is later tracking a witness through an Atlantic City casino by use of the hi tech security camera system. Confusingly we end up with Ricky and the witness appearing on several television screens at once, so they seem to be almost touching yet neither can truly see the other. Unbeknownst to Ricky, we also see Kevin after the same witness with murderous intent. The chase eventually evolves into a menacing scene in a labyrinthine hotel corridor, where we know where the witness is, but neither Ricky nor Kevin do. We see the corridor as Kevin sees it - through his eyes - then a fast and clever angle change shows Kevin as the corridor 'sees' him; I nearly fell out of my seat it startled me so much. And to add further to the blurring of reality (no pun intended here) we also see the world through the eyes of the witness, who, spectacles broken in the melee after the assassination, has only a myopic view of what is happening now, but knows clearly what happened earlier.Acting and actors. Nicolas Cage is a star and can do no wrong for me, though I suspect non-fans may have trouble identifying with the brash noisy braggart that is Ricky at the start of the film. Gary Sinese's character of Dunn has been described in some circles as reptilian, but believe me this besmirches the good name of reptiles. I don't know the female lead (gasp!), though she is vaguely familiar, but was absolutely right for this part of Julia Costell, a whistle blower caught up in events she cannot even begin to comprehend. (I just cheated and went into IMDb to find she is Carla Gugino, but her film history left me none the wiser to be honest).Influences. A bit of Hitchcock I suppose. I was also reminded of Blow Up, and there was a hint of The Conversation, in that increasing paranoia is caused by technology revealing truth and lies, but only slowly and unwillingly.Overall, a film that could have ended up so self referential it turned itself inside out, but Brian de Palma manages, somewhat uncharacteristically it has to be said, not to make the whole thing too clever clever.A cracking good night out.

Fairly predictable stuff, but the execution of it almost defies description.The story unfolds by way of exceptionally clever use of camera angles, so we first see Ricky's view of the truth, then a construct of a lie offered as truth, and finally the real truth about events. The obsession with the use of the camera as a dispassionate witness becomes apparent in the opening scenes, which are breathtakingly shot in one single take, done on hand-held steady cam, lasting the best part of twenty minutes. Ricky is seen, gold mobile phone glued to his ear, making his way through the crowds at the boxing match, laying bets, chasing a defaulting petty crook, calling his wife, calling his mistress, hitting on a cheerleader, trying to meet the champ, and finally plonking his Hawaiian shirted noisy self next to the starchy and restrained Admiral Dunn. Dazzlingly well done.Art imitates art even further when Ricky is later tracking a witness through an Atlantic City casino by use of the hi tech security camera system. Confusingly we end up with Ricky and the witness appearing on several television screens at once, so they seem to be almost touching yet neither can truly see the other. Unbeknownst to Ricky, we also see Kevin after the same witness with murderous intent. The chase eventually evolves into a menacing scene in a labyrinthine hotel corridor, where we know where the witness is, but neither Ricky nor Kevin do. We see the corridor as Kevin sees it - through his eyes - then a fast and clever angle change shows Kevin as the corridor 'sees' him; I nearly fell out of my seat it startled me so much. And to add further to the blurring of reality (no pun intended here) we also see the world through the eyes of the witness, who, spectacles broken in the melee after the assassination, has only a myopic view of what is happening now, but knows clearly what happened earlier.Acting and actors. Nicolas Cage is a star and can do no wrong for me, though I suspect non-fans may have trouble identifying with the brash noisy braggart that is Ricky at the start of the film. Gary Sinese's character of Dunn has been described in some circles as reptilian, but believe me this besmirches the good name of reptiles. I don't know the female lead (gasp!), though she is vaguely familiar, but was absolutely right for this part of Julia Costell, a whistle blower caught up in events she cannot even begin to comprehend. (I just cheated and went into IMDb to find she is Carla Gugino, but her film history left me none the wiser to be honest).Influences. A bit of Hitchcock I suppose. I was also reminded of Blow Up, and there was a hint of The Conversation, in that increasing paranoia is caused by technology revealing truth and lies, but only slowly and unwillingly.Overall, a film that could have ended up so self referential it turned itself inside out, but Brian de Palma manages, somewhat uncharacteristically it has to be said, not to make the whole thing too clever clever.A cracking good night out.

I have seen some twist endings, some passionately bad French films, and even some stalker films, but nothing compares to the cinematic genius that I just witnessed. Being a Bunuel 'virgin', I didn't know what to expect coming into this film.I was ready for anything, but interestingly enough nothing will prepare you for this film. Deeply rooted in cinematic symbolism, we watch as two very interesting devises that are used to bring forth the overall theme of this film. Two devises that I have never seen used in a movie, until now.The first is the obvious. Bunuel successfully uses two different actresses to play the same role of Conchita. At first I thought perhaps it was going to be one of those 'twin' double-cross films where these two girls used this older wealthy man for all his money. I was wrong. Similar to the title of this film, this is a film about passions and desires. It divulges in the emotion of obsession, and the reaction a man can have on someone that he desperately and sexually desires. Mathieu is our possible victim in this story. While both are not the most interesting characters (both have flaws and troubles), they do provide some structured characters. Mathieu is willing to give up everything for this woman that he hardly knows, but is physically attracted to her. It is hard to say that he loves her, but he does lust for her. The dual role of Conchita in this film is used for two purposes. The first is as a distraction, while the second is emotion. Both Conchitas are different in their own way and are used to push forward the story. Whenever Bunuel needed to convey a different emotion, he would bring in the actress that best represented that emotion. At first it was confusing, but as the film progressed you began to see less and less separate actresses, but instead as one character. It is impressive how Bunuel created this illusion.As I mentioned above, there were two devises that I have never seen in a movie before. I explained above about the use of two women for one female role, but the second is a bit subtler. I briefly mentioned it above about how these two women (one character) were used to distract. If you pay attention to the film terrorism is a big part of the universe surrounding Mathieu. While he pines continually for Conchita, the world around him is falling apart. Bombings and deaths are at an all time high, yet he doesn't really seem to notice this. He is so caught up in Conchita that it seems like nothing else exists. He is oblivious to his surroundings. In fact, I would go so far as to say that we are also oblivious to the surroundings. Bunuel does this job of keeping our eye focused on the interchanging women that we sometimes forget or miss the actions surrounding this film. I believe that Bunuel is trying to prove the point that obsession does obscure your vision. It blurs your eyes and forces you to miss crucial elements of your surroundings. It isn't until the end when we are reminded violently of the truth surrounding our characters. I felt that Bunuel was slapping me in the face with that final scene. I had nearly forgotten myself of the terrorism outside, but easily he reminded me. This was a spectacular film that really opened my eyes to a completely new way of film-making. It reminded me of some of the early works of another favorite director of mine Francois Ozon. Both of these talented artists have their own way of creating a world and an emotion, and both do it with some of the most beautiful strokes of their mechanical brush. I would recommend this film to anyone that is willing to experience radical, yet provocative film-making at its best.

In this film it breaks down the acting to psychological levels, giving the audience a mixed message to think about what these characters are doing. The message is 'what is real and what is not real'. The characters are method actor's becoming the role of their character but it does not stop there. The actor's are also revealing to the audience within the movie that they are faking their insanity. This effect has repercussions to the viewer, diluting the stereotype of people and plants the notion to the viewer, what is real?

This quote pertains to 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest' for the shear fact that we do not always no who is telling the true. And what we perceive people to look like and act a certain way are not always true of who they really are. I will explain the scene were Mac discovers for the first time that many people are lying about their mental illness. It starts in the hospital with nurse, Mildred Ratched and nurse Itsu. They are starting a meeting in group therapy. Mac has been busting nurse Ratched balls for a week. Mac raises a question about when he can leave and finds out that he is unable to because he is a criminal but 3 people in the group out of the 4 can leave at there own will but just choose not too leave the mental-institution. Mac says something to the effect that Billy, Martini, Doc and Harding have been letting him bust nurse Ratched's balls, and that they knew Mac was not able to leave because he is a convict. The reason Mac is in this institution is because he was acting and lying to get out of work detail.I think Billy committed suicide because nurse Mildred Ratched is dangerous to Billy because she is a friend with Billy's mother. She exploited his mother against Billy whenever he disputes her. In Billy's eye he sees himself as a boy not a man. One reason is a man would be called Bill. Another is Billy cannot do wrong in fear of disappointing his mother because he is a mommas boy. And now that Billy has had sex, which is one of societies acts of becoming a man, and the total fear of Billy's mother finding out that he is a man now. Because the nurse says she will not keep quiet. Billy feels that he has no way out but to kill himself.The character Chief is acting and lying to every one, as a deaf-mute but more than half way through, we the audience discovers he was just lying. We find this out in the scene where Mac and Chief were sitting on a bench in the hallway to get electric-shock-therapy for acting out. This is the first time Chief speaks in the film when Mac offers Chief a stick of juice-fruit gum. Chief take one and says 'Thank you'. Mac is astonished and shocked that he has been faking being a deaf-mute all this time. From here on out Mac and Chief have made a bond to stick together to get out of this place and go to Canada. In retrospect, what is making these characters lying to just about everyone? Faking symptoms just to get attention whether it is negative or positive, it that crazy in itself, or is it just portraying a time is the U.S. when they had no real identification of who is insane and who is not.

Hellbound Hellraiser II is a brilliant example of that situation in action.A sequel to the 1987 horror sleeper hit Hellraiser, Hellbound exists simply to keep that business flowing. It has no other purpose.For legal reasons, Hellraiser director and screenwriter Clive Barker had to step down from direct creative control over the sequel, and screenwriter Peter Atkins and director Tony Randel stepped up to the plate to deliver a film that is actually more plot less, confusing and gore-filled than its predecessor. To describe Hellbound Hellraiser II is an exercise in futility, but I will endeavor to explain it. Opening almost immediately after the conclusion of Hellraiser, Kirsty Cotton (Ashley Laurence), one of only two survivors of the first film, awakens in a psychiatric ward run by one Dr. Channard (Kenneth Cranham), a psychiatrist and surgeon who appears to have a side interest in the occult (how convenient). He discovers that an individual died on a mattress confiscated by police in Kirsty's father's house and determines that he must resurrect the individual on the mattress so he can get a better understanding of the afterlife, or another dimension, or something. So, he secures one of his more radical patients, takes him to his lavish home and proceeds to give him a straight razor to open himself up on the mattress, thus beginning the cycle of resurrection for Julia Cotton (Claire Higgins), who was Cenobite bait at the end of Hellraiser.Embued with flesh thanks to Channard's willingness to support her thirsty appetites for human blood and flesh, Julia agrees to show him everything he wants in Hell if he can only open the door. So, he recruits an autistic patient from his hospital, named Tiffany (Imogen Boorman), who has an amazing knack at solving puzzles, gives her one of the puzzle boxes that open the doors to Hell, and lets her rip. Meanwhile, Kirsty has had a vision of her father wallowing in Hell, and using a friendship with Channard's protégé, Kyle MacRae (William Hope) they brake into Channard's house to prevent Julia from being brought back from the dead, but they are two late, and end up watching as Channard lets Tiffany open the doors to Hell and then follow them in.To describe the rest of the film would be useless, because there isn't much point. The film has the barest thread of a plot, Kirsty's search for her father, but that is just an excuse for us to be witness to some of the goriest stuff ever put to screen. Hellbound Hellraiser II is not an easy film to watch, and if you are even the slightest bit squeamish, just don't even bother. It is a constant stream of skinless bodies, people cutting themselves open, having themselves cut open, hearts ripped out, various torture implements stuck into skin, etc. There really are no characters to care about, everybody is thin as a sheet, and spend most of the film wandering around some dank, dark corridors running into various unsavory events and images. Randel isn't even trying to generate suspense, he is just letting the grotesqueries unfold on screen for all to see. We feel no tension or fear, no dread, just indifference. It also doesn't help that the film is wildly underexplained, as it's predecessor was. How is it that there apparently is somebody around every corner that has some strange interest in this puzzle box, and why has no one ever noticed that those who end up with it disappear never to return? I guess there is some message here about exploring the darker side of humanity, but it's buried underneath the gore. I must admit, when I was younger, I enjoyed this film, perhaps because the imagery was perverse enough to feed my need for rebellious youth, maybe I had a dark streak, who knows. But as time has progressed, I came to realize the Hellbound is nothing but an endless display of gory effects with no substance. I think we could all do better than this film for two hours of entertainment.

So, he secures one of his more radical patients, takes him to his lavish home and proceeds to give him a straight razor to open himself up on the mattress, thus beginning the cycle of resurrection for Julia Cotton (Claire Higgins), who was Cenobite bait at the end of Hellraiser.Embued with flesh thanks to Channard's willingness to support her thirsty appetites for human blood and flesh, Julia agrees to show him everything he wants in Hell if he can only open the door. So, he recruits an autistic patient from his hospital, named Tiffany (Imogen Boorman), who has an amazing knack at solving puzzles, gives her one of the puzzle boxes that open the doors to Hell, and lets her rip. Meanwhile, Kirsty has had a vision of her father wallowing in Hell, and using a friendship with Channard's protégé, Kyle MacRae (William Hope) they brake into Channard's house to prevent Julia from being brought back from the dead, but they are two late, and end up watching as Channard lets Tiffany open the doors to Hell and then follow them in.To describe the rest of the film would be useless, because there isn't much point. The film has the barest thread of a plot, Kirsty's search for her father, but that is just an excuse for us to be witness to some of the goriest stuff ever put to screen. Hellbound Hellraiser II is not an easy film to watch, and if you are even the slightest bit squeamish, just don't even bother. It is a constant stream of skinless bodies, people cutting themselves open, having themselves cut open, hearts ripped out, various torture implements stuck into skin, etc. There really are no characters to care about, everybody is thin as a sheet, and spend most of the film wandering around some dank, dark corridors running into various unsavory events and images. Randel isn't even trying to generate suspense, he is just letting the grotesqueries unfold on screen for all to see. We feel no tension or fear, no dread, just indifference. It also doesn't help that the film is wildly underexplained, as it's predecessor was. How is it that there apparently is somebody around every corner that has some strange interest in this puzzle box, and why has no one ever noticed that those who end up with it disappear never to return? I guess there is some message here about exploring the darker side of humanity, but it's buried underneath the gore. I must admit, when I was younger, I enjoyed this film, perhaps because the imagery was perverse enough to feed my need for rebellious youth, maybe I had a dark streak, who knows.

Hellbound Hellraiser II is a brilliant example of that situation in action.A sequel to the 1987 horror sleeper hit Hellraiser, Hellbound exists simply to keep that business flowing. It has no other purpose.For legal reasons, Hellraiser director and screenwriter Clive Barker had to step down from direct creative control over the sequel, and screenwriter Peter Atkins and director Tony Randel stepped up to the plate to deliver a film that is actually more plot less, confusing and gore-filled than its predecessor. To describe Hellbound Hellraiser II is an exercise in futility, but I will endeavor to explain it.

It was almost as surpring, however, when I read the comments on IMDb and realized that a large portion of Hitchcock's audience simply didn't get it.

The Trouble with Harry is Hitchcock's own jab at himself, at the entire suspense film genre, and a wonderfully inspired satire on the implications of desensitization. The film is not that simple though, for even in addressing these objectives Hitch tantalizingly avoids any answers or definitive statements. Its a difficult film to describe, but definitely worth seeing as it confirms Hitchcock's dual mastery of comedy and suspense. Watch it for the social commentary, the sleepy New England setting, but above all else, for the blissful irony that fills its every crevace.

It is nothing more. Its purpose is to kill off old characters so new characters and their corresponding toys can be introduced and sold. This is a bad movie. Yet it is a bad movie I have seen over a hundred times and I will likely see many times more. Every time I watch it, a smile reminiscent from my childhood stretches from ear to ear across my face. I first saw this movie when I was a young child, perhaps 4 or 5 years old. Within the first ten minutes, some of my favorite characters had met fairly graphic and violent ends. But all of this would be overshadowed by an event exponentially more tragic. This was the first time I had ever cried in a movie.The story begins during a civil war between two groups of robots, one good and one bad. While this is going on, a gigantic robot that devours planets, threatens the robot's home world. The rest is fairly obvious. Somehow the gigantic robot that devours planets will have to be destroyed, or else there would be now new toys to introduce. The animation is significantly better than the television series, but that really is not saying much. At times it is quite good, but there are other times where it almost looks unfinished. The soundtrack consists of some of the best 80's rock music I have ever heard and it totally fits the film. The heavy metal version of the Transformers Theme is most enjoyable and sets the stage for a very violent movie. The story is clearly the brainchild of the toy maker's marketing department. The title character, 'Hot Rod' is the typical rebellious teenager, or at least what a 9 year old believes what a rebellious teenager should be, who eventually discovers his potential. Then there is the child in the story who was created so young members of the audience would have somebody to both idolize and relate to. The only character of interest is 'Unicron', voiced by the late great filmmaker Orson Welles in one of his final roles. This works only because he adequately brings arrogance to an otherwise one-dimensional character. I love this film, or should I say I love this very bad film.

I am a big fan of Dwight and his music but hell before the movie was over I wanted him dead LOL.I have read some of the things other users have said about this film. I think a few of them are very narrow minded. Some I think have read more into it than what was really there. There was a lot of stereo typing in the movie but it came only from Doyle. Whats a better way to paint a picture of a bad guy in a small town? I thought the movie displayed southerners to have a lot of heart. Hell these people took in Karl with open arms and gave him work and shelter and he was a complete stranger to them.This movie had no explosions, no special fx, no machine guns, no gratuitous nudity, and none of the other Hollywood gimmicks used to put people into the theatre. This movie was just a superb example of film making. This film exhausted all of ur senses. It made you laugh, it made you cry, it made you feel the suspense, but most of all it made you think. I highly recommend it to anyone who has not yet seen it. I give this movie a 12.

I know that this movie gets a lot of complaints, but actually I can see where the writers were going with this. They just had an idea to continue the Halloween stories, but just to do a different type of franchise, which I give them a lot of credit for. Does this movie deliver the same scares as the original Halloween or even the sequel? No, it doesn't, but it's still creepy and not given a proper chance by most. Just the song that is used alone in this movie was a bit intense. It's a great little ghost story that is sure to deliver chills if you have an open mind to it. The acting isn't as good as the other movies, we have some pretty below par actors, but over all they make the movie worth watching even if it was cheesy.On Saturday, October 23, shop owner Harry Grimbridge is chased by mysterious figures wearing business suits. He collapses at a gas station clutching a Silver Shamrock jack-o'-lantern mask and is driven to the hospital by the filling station attendant all the while ranting, They're gonna kill us. All of us. While Grimbridge is hospitalized, another man in a suit enters his room and pulls his skull apart. The man then returns to his vehicle, douses himself with gasoline and lights himself on fire, causing the car to explode. Challis, together with Grimbridge's daughter, Ellie, begins an investigation that leads them to the home of the Silver Shamrock Novelties factory. They learn from a hotel manager, Mr. Rafferty, that the source of the town's prosperity is Irishman Conal Cochran and his factory and that the majority of the town's population is made up of descendants of Irish immigrants. Challis learns that Ellie's father had stayed at the same hotel. Other guests of the hotel included shop owners Marge Guttman, Buddy, Betty and their son Little Buddy. All have business at the factory and eventually meet gruesome ends because of the Silver Shamrock masks.The Kupfer family views the Silver Shamrock commercial that will air on Halloween night. But there's more to these masks then meets the eye. Is Halloween 3 the best sequel? No; is it the worst sequel? No; I'd say just a lot of people got the wrong idea about the movie and didn't know what the writers were thinking when the wrote for this franchise. I loved the ending scene, it actually did give me a nightmare, I don't want to give it away though, just trust me, it's a creepy scene. I do recommend if you love horror movies to give this movie a fair chance or if you want to see the Halloween movie franchise, just remember that the writers just wanted to try something new. I do honestly like this movie, I hope people will see it for what it is and it's just a good ghost story to watch on a night for Halloween.6\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"4 October 2004","score":"56 out of 71 people found the following review useful","review":" This is probably the most controversial Halloween movie, simply because Michael Myers isn't in it.

It had everything, brilliant special effects, a scary villain, fully built set pieces that you had never seen before, a brilliant music score from John Williams and likable characters in Han Solo and Obi-wan Kenobi well played by Harrison Ford and Alec Guinness. It was a film that had blazing action from start to finish, it was a film that the writer and director George Lucas had intended for children, his target audience was twelve and under, but it became a true mega blockbuster and people of all ages came again and again, dragging their friends with them.My favourite scenes include the opening sequence the massive imperial Star Destroyer roaring over the screen attacking the fleeing rebel cruiser, that scene is mind-blowing on a cinema screen, i love the introduction of Darth Vader emerging from the smoke of the laser battle between the Stormtroopers and the Rebels, i also like the way Vader is established as an evil killer right away when he crushes the neck of some poor hapless rebel prisoner holding him up with one hand and throwing him to the side like a rag doll, this gives Vader's character a sense of malevolence from the kickoff.I also like the lightsaber duel between obi-wan and Vader on the Death Star more so for the verbal exchanges between the two Jedi 'When i was with you i was but the learner now i am the master.' Obi-wan'Only a master of evil DARTH!!!' The duel is not as energetic as Luke and Vader in The Empire Strikes Back, but it is still a powerful and moving moment especially when Luke, Han and Leia make a dash for the falcon and Luke sees Obi-wan cornered by Vader. That scene is one of emotion that Lucas hits right on the head, Luke sees Obi-wan's plight, Obi-wan smiles at Vader, he raises his sabre and closes his eyes, Vader strikes as look screams 'NO!' and John Williams score swells with tragic loss as Luke blasts away at the Stormtroopers. Its the one scene that sticks in my mind about A New Hope, that isn't special effects or cgi.The final aerial assault between TIE fighters and X-wing fighters over the Death Star is perhaps the most exciting finale of any movie, the tunnel chase with Luke's X-wing and Vader's TIE fighter thrills ALL the time. Finally i have to say when i talk to people who have seen Star wars in any shape or form, rarely do they say they don't like the movies, but when i do meet someone that hates these classics they ALWAYS say the same thing 'Im not really interested in films.' That says it all, does it not? ","genre":null},{"date":"4 October 2004","score":"3 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" Star Wars was the film that changed cinema forever.
