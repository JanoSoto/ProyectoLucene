Surprise was followed by joy as I learned that the 2002 version of Mr. Deeds contained an outstanding performance from an actor known only for his comedy, a story that has as much heart as jokes and a cast that works so well together it was difficult to tell where real life ended and the acting began. Comedy is the main course and romance was served as dessert on a menu that allowed the audience to take two hours and enjoy the feast provided by Adam Sandler, Winona Ryder, Peter Gallagher, Allen Covert, Steve Buscemi and John Turturro as they delivered non-stop comedy.With every great comedy there is a comedian who reigns victorious as he leads the charge to entertain audiences with comedic wit and charm; Mr. Deeds is no exception since Sandler accomplishes this task within the first 10 minutes. With the box-office success Sandler brought to films such as Big Daddy, The Waterboy and The Wedding Singer, I knew that Mr. Deeds would bring greater success. The most impressive aspect of the film was the presence of Sandler as he gave the BEST performance of his career.Along with his jokes, Sandler brought a surprise; versatility. Known exclusively for his comedic talents, Sandler brought much more including the ability to become a romantic lead and perform the role with conviction. Furthermore, Sandler was able to portray a character that everyone can sit back in awe.Behind every great romantic lead there is an outstanding actress, which makes the romantic aspect of the film, so much better. It was a brilliant move for the casting directors to get Ryder to play opposite Sandler because she is one of the main reasons Mr. Deeds works. She has always amazed audiences with her beauty, charm and immense talent, so when I found out she was attached to this film my face lit up because she gives 110 percent effort in each role.Gallagher, Turturro, Buscemi and Covert increased the comedic support to a film already high on laughter with their respective roles.Watching these actors brought a smile to my face because they were well-cast and each brought their brand of humor to the film and played very well off Sandler. With the addition of Buscemi and Covert, Mr. Deeds came alive as they come together to create the magic they brought to prior works with Sandler such as Big Daddy and The Wedding Singer. Their familiarity with each other shows as they feed off each other very well.I will admit that Mr. Deeds contains a plot that has become cliche and makes me yearn for better creativity and originality. However, it was put together well and got me interested from the start.Overall, the script contains a sweet story that will leave everyone smiling and applauding because it does not attempt to do more than make you laugh. It would be a mistake for anyone to watch Mr. Deeds and walk away in disgust or feel let down. However, it should bring smiles and laughter to those who saw it.

He doesn't help her but doesn't reveal her either and later she returns looking for help.  He reluctantly hides her in his wagon and continues his journey.  Along the way the two get to know one another better and gradually become friends.I am a shallow, obvious man and I watched this film because I think Thandie Newton is not only a great actress but also really rather stunning! There. Cards on table!  Anyway, I was interested in the title of the film and was not surprised to find that, as hinted by the title, that this is really more about a journey than the actual story.  It is a little clichéd in the way that we more or less know where it is going, but it is still pretty engaging nonetheless.  The story struggles a little bit to have as much meaning as it thinks it does, and too much of it is a little unsatisfactory, but it works well enough to do the job for 90 minutes.  The journey is a little forced at times and doesn't always ring true but it is still worth seeing.A big part of this working is due to the characters of August and Annalees and how they work together.  I found both to be interesting and engaging even if nothing was really happening at several points.  It was to be expected, but they become friends and it manages to be quite touching at several points.  Most of the praise of this can be laid at the actors' feet as they make these characters and quite predictable narrative involving and enjoyable.  Patric is great and gives his complex character room to grow as the film progresses - even though his character is not totally clear, he still engaged me.  Newton is good even though she looks far too good to be an escaping slave.  Her accent is good for the most of the film and only occasionally does she go silly with it!  The support cast is not quite as good but Drake and Waterson both do OK.The film looks good and has a gentle atmosphere to it that suits the landscape and also makes the tension easier to raise in the quicker moments (thanks to the contrast).  It isn't a brilliant film, but manages to be an enjoyable one despite the lack of a strong narrative.  The actors do very well to make engaging characters out of what could have easily been cliché and produce emotion out of what could have just been cloying sentiment.

He also is keen to make his debut film that will launch his movie career. He decides to combine the two biggest failures of his life - his film `career' and his love life to make a film about the real search for love in LA.  He sets out to film 20 dates to capture the moment where two people fall in love.  However he is in for a rocky road - not only does he have trouble with his dates but the guy funding his film wants it to be something other than what Myles envisages it to be.This film was made on the cheap and is a mix of documentary and mockumentary; there is no way that all the stuff in this film is real - certainly I never accepted that Elie the producer was the character that the film painted him to be.  However, the majority of it seems to be relatively real and the majority of it is funny - which is the important thing here. Forget Myles arty pretensions about filming true love as it happens, the point here is wit and fun.  The film is a very particular type of wit and if you're not into it then it is likely that you will hate the film; for me I really enjoyed the light humour of the whole piece and found it amusing even if I wouldn't call it hilarious.I really liked the invention of some parts of it the comparisons of the budget in military terms (his film would be the equivalent of one French soldier surrendering to whoever it happens to be at war with), the stuff around Elie, the `meetings' with his agent etc.  In fact most of the funny stuff is staged - and it is for the best.  If I was being cynical I would question whether or not 95% of the film was scripted and acted as natural. But it didn't bother me because I found it funny.Myles himself is a strange guy; he is quite abrasive and pretty unpleasant at times and is a bit of a jerk.  He definitely doesn't deserve Elisabeth but it is easy to be amused by his cruel humour at times.  He holds the attention pretty well when he is on dates, but as an actor I didn't think much of him at one point we learn he refused an offer for a script on the basis that he would only sell it if he could star - he really needs to focus on writing as neither directing or acting appears to be his thing on the basis of this.  The support crew are hilarious.  Myles sound guy and cameraman are funny when they have the chance, while both Richard the agent and Elie are hilarious and don't mind sending themselves up!Overall, treat this film as a comedy rather than a documentary - large chunks of it are staged, but it actually helps the film.

I fear I cannot capture the enormity of this film as a seminal work of art in words - kind of like Trent in his speech to Devon about having failed (even though he is celebrated) - the inability to capture in words the gestalt of life or in this case, just this film. I will leave to others to describe the plot, I am more compelled to describe the impact\/impressions this film had\/made on me1) Incredible acting by the entire cast right down to the main kids (the little girl).

Camelot Gardens is a gated community where wealthy people can purchase luxurious (if sterile) homes and a security force ensures that riffraff will be kept away from your door after nightfall. The Stockard family are new arrivals at Camelot Gardens; father Morton (Christopher McDonald) is a businessman who wants to go into politics, while mother Clare (Kathleen Quinlan) busies herself with affairs with younger men. Neither seems to have much time for their 10-year-old daughter Devon (Mischa Barton), who doesn't care for children her own age; Devon's uncle likes to entertain her with stories about a witch named Baba Yaga who lives in the forest, so one day she wanders into the nearby woods looking for Baba. Instead, she finds a trailer that's home to Trent (Sam Rockwell), a 20-something free spirit who scrapes together a living by mowing the lawns of Camelot Gardens. Devon and Trent both have physical and emotional scars to deal with, and they soon become friends and confidantes; however, Devon's parents become upset when they learn that their daughter's best friend is a grown man, particularly one who lives in a trailer and does lawn maintenance for a living.Mischa Barton was absolutely fabulous and honest in her well written role-she truly deserved some kind of award.Mischa Barton has the more troublesome role. She must portray attraction to Rockwell without slipping into `Lolita' mode, or the dreaded melodramatic may-december domain. While Barton isn't Rockwell, their chemistry is one to step back in awe of. An 18 year gap separates the actors, but it is easy to accept them as a couple. Barton steadfastly maintains her character's intelligence and maturity, without her stooping to childish pranks to sell the differences between Devon and Trent. Through her writing, Wallace does all the work for Barton in this regard.Barton matches Rockwell in just about every way, making them, outside of Freddy and Jason, to be one of the more peculiar, yet lovely screen couples in the history of film. Wallace ends `Lawn Dogs' on a wonderful, secretive note, also staying away from emotional indulgence. We leave the film with a peculiar, fantasy ending, and that's exactly the note to end on. With the guitars dripping with feedback, trying to cover up the sweet melody, `Lawn Dogs' is doing the very same thing. Wallace is now two-for-two, in the quality of her recent product. I can't wait to see what she does next. Mischa Barton deserved an Oscar for this. Some people won't get it.. ...and that's the truth. This movie may not have a story that hits you over the head with a 2x4, but that doesn't mean there is no plot.That plot is loneliness.Lawn Dogs is one of the most honest movies I've ever seen. There are no explosions, the two main characters don't hop into bed every 5 minutes, and the dialog isn't ridiculously clever--this doesn't mean the movie is stupid or dull or political hype. It's just real.Maybe you don't see movies for realism, and that's OK. Most the time I don't either. This film touched me, though. The view of 2 people lost-- not only in life but in their own relationships--was perfect.Maybe my opinion is favorable because I saw a lot of myself in the character of Devon. If this makes me dull and tedious, so be it. How many people do you know give long, eloquent, dramatic speeches every 5 minutes?If you want flashy, warmed over plots and special effects, I advise you to see any movie but this one. If you are looking for some truth in how people relate to each other, Lawn Dogs is for you. The best part of any romantic film is when the leads recognize the critical chemistry they have growing between them, yet are powerless to do anything about it. While most onscreen relationships are eventually consummated, `Dogs' stays inside that reserved, wistful area where declarations of love and sex are kept at arm's length. `Lawn Dogs' is a story of heartache, but conceived by Wallace not as a downer, but as a luminous observance of attraction and connection in unlikely situations.Devon is rock steady as is Trent, but the thin layer of melancholy running through the character makes the experience all the more fulfilling. I had a fun time reading all the reviews for this movie. I can't help but wonder why adults who hated and didn't get this movie would bother to set through it let alone write lengthy reviews using highly colorful & hateful terms. If you don't like friendship movies don't watch them. Intelligent people wouldn't set through something they hated with a passion unless they were deliberately trying to find fault with it or the starring actors.Either you like the movie or the actors or you don't. I have a list I don't care much for either but I'm not going to waste my time using colorful metaphors talking about them.Mischa is one of the sweetest kids you will ever see. She's cute, honest, and when she smiles her entire face glows.Mischa was literally thrown into the acting business after doing a commercial or two. Before that she sang and danced. She was in fact very inexperienced when she did Lawn Dogs. Her two first films aren't even available in the USA though I have seen them and LOVED them. If you understand the circumstances you should realize that with no more experience than she had at that time she did a fantastic job in this movie. The audience loved her!For those people who really love to watch bad movies so they can hate them I have list they might like. ;^) You could start with The Polish Vampire in Burbank and move on to Behind the Green Door just for starters. I find it frustrating to turn the TV on and have 300 or so channels with nothing worth watching. But that's how the movie and TV shows are these days. I can't help but wonder if it is a lack of good scripts or if the producers just can't recognize a good script from a bad one. When a movie as bad as The Blair Witch, made by students on a budget of $8000 can turn a profit of more than $140,000,000 that's sad business. When people pay to see bad movies it sends the wrong signal to every producer in Hollywood. I have no doubt my kids could make a better movie than that.Lawn Dogs is a feel good movie and if you like John Duigan of these characters you should like the movie. The acting and stuff in it are geared for a friendship flick and they accomplish exactly what the director wanted them to. I cannot believe that no critics have praised her or she hasn't got any awards. I know you may think a relationship between a 10 year old and a twenty-something is hardly entertaining and boring, but Barton's performance is one of the best I've seen in age and that alone makes it worth seeing.

I remember seeing the Spader flick on t.v. one night and thought it was really great, however after seeing this I was reminded of the film, and thought that they shared similar traits.  Though, as I said before, this movie was a lot better.

However, less than an hour before the event, Henry is called into the police station by friend Capt Victor Benezet to clarify some points on his statement.  Henry had discovered a dead child on a local beach but the police doubt some of the things in his story.  As the time ticks down, Victor comes under pressure to release Henry but at the same time his story begins to reveal lies.  The situation is only made more revealing when Henry's wife comes into the station.Everyone loves a good thriller so it was a surprise to me how quickly this film with it's heavy-weight cast managed to slip through the UK cinemas almost unnoticed.  There is nothing significantly wrong with it to justify the low box office it seemed to generate, so I'm not sure why it happened. The story is set, for unknown reasons, in San Juan, a fact that is only distracting as none of the principals are Puerto Rican and their presence there is never really settled.  Anyway, the film is very much a play that is carried by the two main characters.  The revelations and movement of the plot is engaging and it is great fun to watch.  The ending is difficult though - we are taught to expect a certain type of ending in this sort of film and it is slightly disappointing when it doesn't come.I expected a big twist and, in a way, that happened but the fall out from it isn't well explained by the film and a lot is left for you to think about. In that respect it is difficult, again because we are not expecting that type of ending but also that it is quite hard to understand as it is very tied up in the emotions of complex characters - complexities that we having been watching because we've only been seeing them as `twists' and revelations.  That said, I still enjoyed the ending and thought it was brave to be different - just a shame it was badly handled.The cast are roundly great and are a big reason that the film remains gripping.  Hackman and Freeman are great actors and having them both in the same film was enough of a draw to get me watching.  The vast majority of their scenes are shared and they interact together really, really well when it comes to the dramatics.  What they don't do as well is convince that they really are old friends.  Jane is good but his character is far too simplistic and brash.  Bellucci is better than I have seen her, but she is a little too wound up emotionally.  She is very good looking and I was glad that the film didn't just trade on that, but it didn't (or couldn't) get a great deal out of her.The director manages to add energy and style to what could have been a rather contain piece (like a play).  Visually it is exciting but, looking back, it was more important to develop character than deliver a slick thriller - something he didn't do well at all.  The ending is weak because it takes thought, as we have not been forced to look at the complex characters.  It was Hopkins' job to make us do that but he can't manage it.Overall this is an enjoyable film that will frustrate many with the ending. Despite being a clever and different conclusion, it doesn't really work because of the director making the wrong sort of film to suit that ending. However for the vast majority it really works and the strength of the two lead performances mean that, for all it's flaws, this is never a dull film.

First, it is the closest I have seen a director come to creating a Kubrick style of filmaking.  However, the ending for this movie is terrible.Toys is about a man named Leslie Zevo whose father's toy company is taken over by his uncle, General Leland Zevo.  The General tries to change the toy line from wind-up toys and dolls to military equipment and is trying to create a toy army operated by little children on remote the control.  The plot sounds far fetched but it works.The beginning of this movie if flawless. The entire production design was definately Oscar worthy.  Barry Levinson manages to create this incredible world.  I actually did feel like I as watching a Stanley Kubrick film because of the camera and design.  There's one chilling scene were Robin Williams is discussing some of the novelty items the company will produce and as he does it the walls of the room he is in slowly close in because the General needs more space to build his war toys.  Out of all the films I've seen in the 90's this scene would rank as one of the most memorable amoung them.The performances are good.  Michael Gambon and Robin Williams are both strong (I think Robin Wright was mis-cast though).  However, Joan Cusack gives one of the most incredible performances I've ever seen.  She plays a very child like adult, almost retarded but doesn't quite cross the line. The risks she takes and her characterization are all brilliant.  There is one momennt when she is at her father's funeral and she just talks about how the word tinhorns stays with her.  It's so beautiful and pure.Now, about the ending.  There is a scene in the film where the General tries to kill a fly with a gun.  The movie should have ended with him trying to shoot the fly, but then shooting himself.  However, there is this whole cliche plotline about bad guys becoming good, there's a toy battle which goes against the thematic elements of the movie, and there's an unesecary love scene that ruins the Kubrickian mood.  The ending actually reminded me of a movie called Baby Geniuses and anyone who has seen both movies (which I'm sure is unlikely) will agree with me.Oh well, if you see Toys watch up to the scene with the General and the fly and then stop.

When he meets his daughter's best friend it kicks off a realisation that his life needs to change, starting with quitting his job and acting less responsible.  Meanwhile the lives of both Carolyn and Jane Burnham begin to change in different ways as they also try to deal with the empty days that they seem to live.When this film came out it jumped almost to the top of the imdb top 250 list - much as many films that make a big audience think or feel something do. Also it gained award after award and was basically held up as a generally great film.  I saw it at the time and was very impressed by it as it touched a nerve in some regards.  Watching it several years later I still am able to take some thinks from it but am more open to the faults that are within it. The actual plot is exaggerated in terms of it not fitting in with the average audience member's experience.  However it's wide wings will mean that it will speak to a large section of it's audience.The points it has to say are very broad but are delivered in a reasonable manner - i.e. not overly veiled but not rammed down our throats.  I like to think I am a few years off a midlife crisis but I can see my life in Lester's feelings, as many of us can - hence the film's success.  This is not to say that the whole plot is perfect for it is not.  The film is slightly arty and, sadly, a bit pretentious.  I almost dare not say it as I know many audience members were very touched by the `bag scene', but I did think to myself that the film must be very good to be able to carry off a scene that is so full of cheese and pretension!  This happens at several points throughout the film in different ways and does take away from the film somewhat.  Likewise the film's lapse into `whodunit' towards the end doesn't really work either.  Happily the central plot and the classy delivery from director Mendes makes for a great film.The cast greatly helps and were appropriately rewarded for their work. Spacey may have been in the process of losing his edge by this point in his career (hopefully he'll get back to his best, but he hasn't at the time of writing).  Here he is great and his semi-comic delivery helps smooth out some of the unlikely edges on his character.  Bening is given a lesser role in terms of not being central to the story but her character is actually more emotionally real than Lester - she has to deal with life like the majority of us whereas Lester flees from it.  Birch is good and underplays well while it is nice to see Suvari in a film that isn't average.  Bentley has the least role of the film as his character is the most abstractly drawn and least realistic.  He is OK in the role but he is limited by what he has to work with.  Janney's role is small and one dimensional but her performance is great - it is hard to believe that this is the same woman that plays the super confident and talkative CJ in West Wing!  Cooper is as good as ever and small roles are well done by Gallagher, Bakula and Robards.Overall this is a very good film but I find it hard to accept that it has been consistently as high up the critics (amateur and professional) lists as it has been.  It has a good plot that has broad enough characters so that most viewers will find something to relate to, but this stretch also opens it up to problems that serve to weaken the film somewhat.  That said, this is still a film that is thoughtful, artistic, character driven and moving - and when a big Hollywood film manages to do that then it is a cause for praise, not complaint.

This is one such film and, while not the equal of the emotionally similar Remains of the Day, it is still a worthy story that is strikingly well told.  The film tells the supposedly true story of CS Lewis' love and marriage with Joy in a slow manner that only lets out the feeling as slowly and as shielded as Lewis himself.  I don't know how accurate the tale is as all I know of Lewis is his work.  However, the gradual flow of emotion both works for and against the film.  It works against the film in that the drama seems rather stilted and folded in on itself.  But the upside of this is that, when the film (and Lewis) starts to feel, it is like a rush of relief after so much in the way of holding back and unrealised emotion.Of course for many, the patience required will be too much when compared to the emotional pay off, and that is a fair point, as this film is not the most moving one I have ever seen. However what helps make it is a tremendous performance by Hopkins.  Recently I have seen him slumming in several films and it is difficult to watch those knowing what he can do.  Here he holds back but allows us to see that he is holding back - that's very different from just not showing emotion (hell, even Steven Segal can do that!). Winger is good albeit in a less obvious way.  Her role require more forwardness and emotion on her sleeve - at times her character seems easy (indeed it is not as interesting as Lewis) but she still does well.  The support cast all do as well, there are no weak links, not even Mazzello - so awful in Jurassic Park yet so reliable here.Overall this is a `worthy' film, meaning that it is not perfect but it is still worth seeing.  The emotion is all rather turned in on itself and it loses some impact for that reason but the story is still involving and the performances are good.

It was fun, it was weird, it was cool, it was punchy.I'd started to become so wary of the abject crap that Hollywood was putting out these days, that I'd fallen into the habit of NOT obeying my long tradition of going on opening weekend... waiting for a few reviews to come in from The Man On The Street, and then making my decision about whether or not to spend my hard-earned cash on a movie, or just download it instead, just to satisfy my curiousity.  (sometimes the ad campaign hints that the movie will suck, and sometimes the ads can be very compelling for a movie that winds up being very mediocre)Thing is, certain movies seem like such a no-brainer that I throw caution to the wind and go on opening-weekend, just for old time's sake.  When I first saw MIB2 advertised, I thought about how much I giggled and smiled during the first one, that I thought sure, I won't download this, it's GOT to be good, I'll cheerfully fork over the cash and go see it opening weekend.Very rarely am I THIS wrong about a movie.  The entire plot was a rehash of the first movie, without any of the wit, charm, pacing, or gee-whiz of discovery.I actually find myself enjoying the original Men In Black, in retrospect, LESS than I did before seeing MIB2.  I don't know how to describe it... it's not that the plot of MIB2 breaks continuity with MIB or anything technical like that.  It's just, somehow, I didn't feel cheated after seeing MIB, but after seeing MIB2, I feel not only cheated by it, but also by MIB.Lara Flynn Boyle was supposed to be sexy and\/or funny, and she was neither. The gags were supposed to be funny, and they weren't.  The action wasn't interesting. The gadgets weren't cool.  The CG was cheap and fake-looking and bad.  It wasn't even that the whole story played like a feature length Mercedes-Benz commercial,  it was that people I normally like in movies were just bad.  I never hate Will Smith in anything, he usually nails it.  Not here.  The only person who wasn't awful was Tommy Lee Jones, but that's probably just because the role called for a very flat performance, making a good performance somewhat indistinguishable from a bad one.Even if you're curious, take my advice and save your money at the rental shop and\/or your bandwidth on the P2P systems, and keep your happy memories of the first movie.I wish I could un-see MIB2.(end of primary review, specific details of the movie follow, stop reading here if you don't want to be spoiled)SPOILER-SPACE .......... SPOILER-SPACE .......... SPOILER-SPACE ..........Certain details were handled badly.  This movie could have been great as a turn-the-tables style rehash of MIB, only now it's young hotshot MIB Will Smith who must show new recruit Tommy Lee Jones the ropes... only his style of indoctrination is comically different from how it was handled in the first movie.  Instead, we get the Re-Neuralizer... a big white room that undoes whatever magic the De-neuralizer does.Also, and perhaps this was a nod to the comic book, I never read it, but showing us another closing shot of the worlds within worlds idea seemed unnecessary, but maybe the comic always ended that way.  It seemed less gimmickey in the first movie.  It was actually kinda cute.  In MIB2 it just came off as tired.The family room scene with a cameo by Sonnenfeld was gratuitous and broke the pathetic excuse for comic pacing that this movie had.  Speaking of Cameos, I really didn't need to see Whacko Jacko in this... the idea that Michael Jackson is really an alien is a cute and potentially funny joke, but he was just on screen for waaaay too long, and it just didn't 'hit'.  It came off as indulgent and was actually painful to watch.There was exactly one joke in this movie that actually worked, and it was A) a mildly racist cliché and B) in the commercial.  The line about how the inflatable driver of the spiffy Mercedes-Benz used to be black, but he always got pulled over.  Every other joke either fell flat or made me wince.And I know I'm kinda weird in that, even though her acting is often less-than-stellar, I kinda like Linda Fiorentino.  For some reason, I enjoy her in every movie I see her in, even if she's kinda bad.  Maybe I just want to bone her, I don't know.  Short version, she's not in this movie at all, with maybe one cryptic line of explanation as to why.  I thought she was kinda fun as the one person who would actually make a decent sidekick for Will Smith's character, and ultimately winds up as his partner in the end of MIB.  There was something about that which 'hit' for me.  But alas, no Linda.  Instead we get Lara as the Big Bad, who I really, really wanted to like in this, and find her all Deliciously Evil and gigglesome. She was just boring, unsexy and unfunny.  In the minor gripe category, this movie killed my disinterested quasi- crush on Lara.  It's just gone now.  Poof.  Not a huge loss, admittedly, but certainly an E Misdemeanor to add to this movie's huge list of crimes against the MIB franchise.The pacing sucked, the comedy wasn't, and the plot bored.

Off course, there have been other brilliant, eminent masterpieces; films that are for ten other reasons better or more important in film history, but they all somehow didn't connect like the ones mentioned above. Why did The Usual Suspects impress me so much, and why is it one of the best movies of the previous decade? To be honest, I don't have the ultimate anwser. It has probably to do with a number of aspects.First of all, I like mysterious film noirs with a lot of suspence. And this film has a lot of suspence, from the beginning the atmosphere is just right.Secondly, the story is brilliant (although not very realistic). The script is so clever, and the ending... well everybody is talking about the incredible ending. Usually, a who-done-it is very disapointing, (it is either predictable or it has an over-the-top surprise-element, which makes you want to throw up), but this ending is the opposite.The story evolves around one question Who is Kayser Soze? (so actually it is a who-is-it) When the film begins, we know this he is a legendary, very violent drugdealer who, in the beginning of the film, probably (he is the only suspect) murdered a group of other drugdealers on a boat. Very soon after this violent episode, it is clear that every character (including the investigator, played by Chazz palminteri) is scared s**tless when the name Kayser Soze is even mentioned. The fear of this creature (after a while you start not to think of him as a human being) is one of the main reasons why this film is so thrilling. The actors are very important in this process of communicating fear to the audience. They are overall very good, especially Kevin Spacey (Oscar), Gabriel Byrne and Chazz Palminteri. Benicio Del Toro is from time to time very funny; Baldwin, Pollack and Postlethwaite are ok. It is true that the ending has a tremendous influence on how one perceives the film as a whole. The film is, as a result, more or less lifted to a higher level. But still, without it, the film is brilliant anyway. I watched it over and over again (even for the second time in the theater, which never happens!) and, although I know about the story's development, it is still impressive a combination of a clever story, good acting, suspence, dark atmosphere, a good score, ok-dialogues, and the memory of me sitting in the theater, overwhelmed, hardly breathing and holding my chair firmly with two hands.

I'm talking about one of those experiences in the theater which you want to have over and over again, but you know that it's impossible and it makes you sad. Off course, there have been other brilliant, eminent masterpieces; films that are for ten other reasons better or more important in film history, but they all somehow didn't connect like the ones mentioned above. Why did The Usual Suspects impress me so much, and why is it one of the best movies of the previous decade? To be honest, I don't have the ultimate anwser. It has probably to do with a number of aspects.First of all, I like mysterious film noirs with a lot of suspence. And this film has a lot of suspence, from the beginning the atmosphere is just right.Secondly, the story is brilliant (although not very realistic). The script is so clever, and the ending... well everybody is talking about the incredible ending. Usually, a who-done-it is very disapointing, (it is either predictable or it has an over-the-top surprise-element, which makes you want to throw up), but this ending is the opposite.The story evolves around one question Who is Kayser Soze? (so actually it is a who-is-it) When the film begins, we know this he is a legendary, very violent drugdealer who, in the beginning of the film, probably (he is the only suspect) murdered a group of other drugdealers on a boat. Very soon after this violent episode, it is clear that every character (including the investigator, played by Chazz palminteri) is scared s**tless when the name Kayser Soze is even mentioned. The fear of this creature (after a while you start not to think of him as a human being) is one of the main reasons why this film is so thrilling. The actors are very important in this process of communicating fear to the audience. They are overall very good, especially Kevin Spacey (Oscar), Gabriel Byrne and Chazz Palminteri. Benicio Del Toro is from time to time very funny; Baldwin, Pollack and Postlethwaite are ok. It is true that the ending has a tremendous influence on how one perceives the film as a whole. The film is, as a result, more or less lifted to a higher level. But still, without it, the film is brilliant anyway.

Perhaps this is one of those timeless, flawless movies that will have an enduring effect on you as a moviegoer. David Lean is one of my favourite directors...I have watched many of his movies and have loved them all. However, I think the two David Lean movies that have had the greatest effect on me are 'Lawrence of Arabia' and 'The Bridge on the River Kwai'.Based on the true story of T.E. Lawrence, the movie takes us to the depths in epic storytelling. From the beautiful Arabian deserts...and the horror of wars...to the trauma faced by the human heart and mind. The breathless cinematography is brilliant...it carries you away to Arabia with Lawrence. The story is so involving...the strategies needed to be devised, the problems needed to be faced, the fight to unite one race to battle against foreign invasion, and the greatness of a legendary man.I think the beautiful scenic locations are not the only things that make this a great movie. What matters is the human struggle in this movie. T.E. Lawrence faces the most traumatic elements that he cannot forget; his torture in a Turkish prison, the deaths of the two young Arabian boys who admired him (and whom he had adored so much), the moment when Lawrence had to kill Gasim to keep others satisfied, and the ultimate war itself and the killings of so many people. This in now way had been easy for him and these brilliant expressions are brought to life by Peter O'Toole in a performance that deserved an Oscar but never got him one. The actors are all magnificent. O'Toole is brilliant and plays Lawrence to perfection, Sharif is so expressive and admirable as Sharif Ali and who could forget the wonderful Alec Guinness as Prince Faisal. I watched this the first time thinking that Guinness was a real Arabian! A wonderful ensemble of actors...out of whom I found none to be less deserving of praise. David Lean's talent unleashes in this grand epic tale which has all the beauty a film should have...ranging from brilliant locations to emotions and elements going far beyond that.

Mark likes the time that he spends with his family because at first, they seem picture perfect, and that's what Mark wants at a time like that, a feeling of being part of a whole family again.

Of course, in a movie like this, no one believes Mark that little Henry could be a bad kid, so Mark takes it upon himself to protect Henry's unsuspecting family (and especially Henry's mother) from their twisted little boy when they would not do so for themselves. And Henry has a grand old time, trying to psyche Mark out with all the nasty things he hints that he may or may not do (or have already done).I saw this movie a lot when I was a kid because I was so in love with Elijah Wood at the time.

Also, Laurie Metcalf (who was in Desperately Seeking Susan), as usual, is one of the funniest characters in the whole movie (just wait till you watch the scene with her and Ullyseus at the mall). It is a great romantic comedy, and one that I think 80s fans are sure to enjoy. Plus, Chaz Jenkel (who did some of the music for 'Real Genius') adds some great synthesizer\/bongo drums music for this movie. ","genre":"Comedy, Romance, Sci-Fi"}]
