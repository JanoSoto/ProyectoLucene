The film is directed by Richard Brooks, as apparently Kazan and Williams did not get along.Now for my big confession - I have never cared for this play because I find it extremely loud, strident, and ultimately irritating. This includes the television version with Sir Laurence Olivier, in which he looked like Colonel Sanders that also starred Jean Stapleton, Robert Wagner and Natalie Wood. I think the main problem is that Cat was written for the stage and doesn't play as well in any other venue - certainly not on television, where these larger than life characters become overwhelming.It's the story of a dysfunctional southern family with a dying patriarch and an alcoholic son who broke his leg recreating a moment of glory on the football field one drunken night. He has turned away from his wife; meanwhile, his brother and sister-in-law continue to breed brats and hope to get most of Big Daddy's estate once he dies. The film is criticized because the censors demanded that references to Brick's homosexuality be eliminated from the script. Seen with today's eyes, it's an unnecessary criticism. Brick started drinking after Skipper's death; Skipper hated Maggie, Brick's wife; Brick started a football team because, while he was good enough to play with the big pros, Skipper wasn't; and Brick isn't interested in sex with his gorgeous wife. Hello. How many other ways are there to say it? As with anything that stars Paul Newman, there is some brilliant acting to be had, and as Brick, he delivers, though perhaps he isn't quite enough of a bum. Elizabeth Taylor has been blessed with many gifts - an incredibly beautiful face being one - but she was behind the door when the great voices were given out. As Maggie, her voice is particularly cloying, though she gives an excellent performance. She was working under the terrible burden of having lost her husband, Mike Todd, right after filming began. At the age of 26, her professionalism is astonishing, and she looks sensational throughout the film during what must have been a horrible time for her. Supposedly the director insisted on repeat takes of the scene during which the family eats in order to get her to take some nourishment. Like Lana Turner, Taylor is one of those stars whose career accomplishments took second place to her private life in the mind of the public. Given the quantity and quality of much of her work, it's really not fair.Burl Ives successfully repeats his stage role; Madeline Sherwood is brilliant as the annoying wife of Gooper, and Jack Carson plays Gooper well, though it's not much of a role. Judith Anderson makes a good Big Mama. Ives and Newman score big-time in their long scene together in the basement; it's a very touching and magnificently acted. As far as Big Daddy favoring his alcoholic, childless son over his first-born - the scene where Big Mama admits to having been four months pregnant with Gooper when Big Daddy proposed says it all. Gooper probably isn't Big Daddy's son.Recommended for the performances, but keep the volume down on your television.

Never afraid to skirt the waters of controversy, he was one of the few willing to take a plunge in those waters. Dr Strangelove remained his finest hour, but many of his films have polarised audiences. Some think he was one of the defining directors of our generation. Others believe he was a pessimist with a nasty nature. I think there is room for both viewpoints.And certainly The Shining elicits similar responses from people. Some who believe it's one of the greatest horror films ever made. And others who believe it's a film that makes no narrative sense. My opinion of the film is a little guarded. It's an impressive film to be sure, but it comes up a bit short in other areas, and is certainly a lesser film in Kubrick's canon of work.Stephen King allegedly hated the film upon its release because it strayed too far from the novel. And it's true. The novel was a tightly focused horror story about a haunted hotel, the Overlook, which was possessed by the spirits of those who had lived within its walls. One thing I liked about the book was I always got the impression the hotel had a persona. It felt like a living creature roused by the people staying there, and played upon their insecurities to destroy them.But that only feels half realised in the film. Kubrick isn't really that interested in the supernatural elements. His interest lied in the themes of isolation and alienation. The character of Jack Torrance (a characteristically over the top performance from Jack Nicholson) is a recovering alcoholic suffering from a severe case of writers block. While acting as caretaker of the Overlook, he wants to devote his time to writing a novel. The first month passes without incident (helpfully marked by ominous captions). But as Jack becomes more immersed in his work, he begins to slowly lose his grip on reality.One thing that can be admired about The Shining is its technical craft. Kubrick's direction is crisp and concise. And the Overlook is an impressive piece of set-design. Built on a single soundstage, with interconnecting corridors, ballrooms and passageways, the Overlook is a vast, self-contained world unto itself. You really do feel you could wander through those corridors for hours. And Kubrick makes great use of Steadicam, allowing for fluidic tracking shots, like Danny on his tricycle riding through the corridors or running from a demented Jack through a frozen hedge maze.And Kubrick is very effective at setting up a tangible atmosphere of dread and unease. You do feel there may be something lurking around every corner at the Overlook. I like the scene when Danny turns a corner and runs right into the twins. That scene never fails to send shivers down my spine. Or the chilling scene when Jack is stalked by an old hag in one of the rooms.It's just a shame the actors themselves sabotage what could have been a very effective horror show, and Kubrick lets his own pessimism about the human condition get in the way. Jack Nicholson was all wrong for this part. We can tell right from the start that he's stark raving mad, so there's no sense of surprise when he loses his mind and lashes out at his family. That type of character arc was explored to much greater effect in Falling Down and One Hour Photo. A much more normal person would have greatly added to the last half hour, and provided more of a jolt. There's only so much of Jack Nicholson cackling wildly and grinning like a loon that you can take before you feel tempted to switch off.Shelley Duval isn't much better. She spends the film either shrieking like a banshee, looking horrified to the camera, or mumbling Jack over and over. And Danny Lloyd isn't very sympathetic either. He has a very inexpressive face, and his waggling finger, which is supposed to represent the Shining is an embarrassing letdown.The film isn't very fair to Scatman Crothers either. He got to play hero in the book, but here the film turns convention on its head, and disposes of him in a most callous way. Another example of Kubrick's sensibilities getting in the way.The climax in the hedge maze is good, even though by that time you've long since stopped caring about these characters. In the end, The Shining emerges only as a good idea for a film when it could have been a masterful exercise in supernatural paranoia. If you want to see a really good film about a spooky hotel, check out the Coen brothers under-appreciated Barton Fink. It's a far superior film, and is everything The Shining could have been.

","genre":"Drama, Horror"},{"date":"28 October 2006","score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" This comment may contain spoilers *** There are two pretty extraordinary shots in this film. In the first, Nastassja Kinski is sitting with her head back on the seat rest. She's traveling in a train. She stares into the camera. And the background changes into a busy railway station where she opens a door and walks into an oneiristic room of tangerine and black leopards and all is explained to her by the image of her brother, Malcom MacDowell.The second is the last shot in the film. We see a screen full of the panther's face behind the bars of the zoo. The panther roars open mouthed, then closes its jaws and the frame freezes on the gigantic cat staring into the camera with its hypnotic green eyes and vertical pupils and its glimpse of pink tongue, a beacon of the uncanny. The shot lasts for many seconds. There seems to be no one else in the world but the viewer and that panther, staring at each other. By this time we know pretty much what the panther is feeling. And, our gaze locked on the frozen image, we feel at one with the beast. We can easily imagine that the cat's stare is a knowing one, that she knows what we feel too. It's like Rilke on mushrooms, describing the starving soul of a caged panther. Just at times the curtain parts quietly inside his eyes. Along a nerve, awareness darts - arriving in his heart, it dies. But, apropos, maybe we'd better not make too much of that shot. Many years ago I used to feel the same way after a refreshing dose of herbal tea, staring at the four Beatles staring back at me from the open cover of the Sergeant Pepper album. And besides, when you come right down to it, I'm not sure it's a good idea to have a man-eating carnivore reading your mind.Anyway the director, Paul Schrader, should have his hand shaken for those two scenes. His work throughout is professionally competent. He has a tendency to see the world in terms of good and evil -- usually with someone caught between -- and the results aren't always pretty. The Cat People isn't too different in that regard. And the cat theme of the original is giganticized these cats are real monsters.The thing may be another remake but it's a good one. The production design and lighting are magnificent. The original was done by Val Lewton at RKO on a budget that was probably one nanobillionth of what was spent on this one, and the earlier version is at least as good. We must at least give the first version bonus points for originality.I don't want to get into the story because it's either simple enough to have been adequately described elsewhere or so complicated that it would take too much space. Essentially it's about a brother and sister -- MacDowell and Kinski -- who inhabit a world between black panthers and human beings. MacDowell and Kinski seem to be the only specimens around, although the legend suggests they ought to form a community through chain migration. They remain human as long as they mate with their own kind. (MacDowell wants to put a little something in the kitty. A frisson of incest here.) If they mate with humans they turn into killer panthers and in order to get well again they must kill. But how can they pass on this catabolic capacity without belonging to a community of cat people? Right away there's a problem with the plot, similar to the one in the original. Simone Simon in the original was apparently human UNLESS she mated with a human. (Her long-suffering husband was Kent Smith.) She morphs into a panther when her psychiatrist puts some moves on her and she tears him to shreds. It took me many years to realize that he must have raped her before this happened, but it couldn't be shown on screen. The problem is that Simone Simon morphs at will twice earlier in the movie, in two truly spooky scenes involving a bus and a swimming pool. Kinski, virgo intacta, also apparently morphs in order to kill a rabbit. It all strains the logical faculty.The acting is pretty good. John Heard comes across as a likable kind of guy. Annette O'Toole, as the colleague who loves him, is too good to be true. In real life, she'd be a woman who disarticulates her rival Kinski from top to bottom. Now there's an idea. How many more magnetic actresses have there been than Nastassja Kinski? Not too many. She seems so innocent, with her softly modulated infantile voice. Her lips are askew. Her right eye is open and clear, her left is heavily lidded. She seems rarely to look straight at someone else, so the other person can't know whether Kinski is being shy or sly. She glows with an inner heat, a human Franklin stove with trim legs and a saucy rear. Madre de Dios, that crabbing scene with Heard, when she bends over in her shorts and waders!

In the first, Nastassja Kinski is sitting with her head back on the seat rest. She's traveling in a train. She stares into the camera.

We see a screen full of the panther's face behind the bars of the zoo. The panther roars open mouthed, then closes its jaws and the frame freezes on the gigantic cat staring into the camera with its hypnotic green eyes and vertical pupils and its glimpse of pink tongue, a beacon of the uncanny. The shot lasts for many seconds. There seems to be no one else in the world but the viewer and that panther, staring at each other. By this time we know pretty much what the panther is feeling. And, our gaze locked on the frozen image, we feel at one with the beast. We can easily imagine that the cat's stare is a knowing one, that she knows what we feel too. It's like Rilke on mushrooms, describing the starving soul of a caged panther. Just at times the curtain parts quietly inside his eyes. Along a nerve, awareness darts - arriving in his heart, it dies. But, apropos, maybe we'd better not make too much of that shot. Many years ago I used to feel the same way after a refreshing dose of herbal tea, staring at the four Beatles staring back at me from the open cover of the Sergeant Pepper album. And besides, when you come right down to it, I'm not sure it's a good idea to have a man-eating carnivore reading your mind.Anyway the director, Paul Schrader, should have his hand shaken for those two scenes. His work throughout is professionally competent. He has a tendency to see the world in terms of good and evil -- usually with someone caught between -- and the results aren't always pretty. The Cat People isn't too different in that regard. And the cat theme of the original is giganticized these cats are real monsters.The thing may be another remake but it's a good one. The production design and lighting are magnificent. The original was done by Val Lewton at RKO on a budget that was probably one nanobillionth of what was spent on this one, and the earlier version is at least as good. We must at least give the first version bonus points for originality.I don't want to get into the story because it's either simple enough to have been adequately described elsewhere or so complicated that it would take too much space. Essentially it's about a brother and sister -- MacDowell and Kinski -- who inhabit a world between black panthers and human beings. MacDowell and Kinski seem to be the only specimens around, although the legend suggests they ought to form a community through chain migration. They remain human as long as they mate with their own kind. (MacDowell wants to put a little something in the kitty. A frisson of incest here.) If they mate with humans they turn into killer panthers and in order to get well again they must kill. But how can they pass on this catabolic capacity without belonging to a community of cat people? Right away there's a problem with the plot, similar to the one in the original. Simone Simon in the original was apparently human UNLESS she mated with a human. (Her long-suffering husband was Kent Smith.) She morphs into a panther when her psychiatrist puts some moves on her and she tears him to shreds. It took me many years to realize that he must have raped her before this happened, but it couldn't be shown on screen. The problem is that Simone Simon morphs at will twice earlier in the movie, in two truly spooky scenes involving a bus and a swimming pool. Kinski, virgo intacta, also apparently morphs in order to kill a rabbit. It all strains the logical faculty.The acting is pretty good. John Heard comes across as a likable kind of guy. Annette O'Toole, as the colleague who loves him, is too good to be true. In real life, she'd be a woman who disarticulates her rival Kinski from top to bottom. Now there's an idea. How many more magnetic actresses have there been than Nastassja Kinski? Not too many. She seems so innocent, with her softly modulated infantile voice. Her lips are askew. Her right eye is open and clear, her left is heavily lidded. She seems rarely to look straight at someone else, so the other person can't know whether Kinski is being shy or sly. She glows with an inner heat, a human Franklin stove with trim legs and a saucy rear. Madre de Dios, that crabbing scene with Heard, when she bends over in her shorts and waders!

And the sad thing is that most people are too close-minded to see that. The general consensus seems to be It's the Spice Girls in a movie? It's going to be awful! and either they never see the movie, or they allow their prejudices to judge the movie for them.Firstly, let me say that I am not, and was never, a Spice Girls fan. I was way too old for their target market when they were popular, and whilst one or two of their songs had catchy tunes, some were downright annoying. They were a very cleverly manufactured girl band in a time when that market was wide-open. Giving each girl a distinctive character and style was a stroke of genius on the part of their 'creators', and while they didn't have particularly strong voices (except perhaps for Mel C), they didn't have particularly bad ones either. I've heard far worse. So I went into this movie purely out of curiosity, expecting it to be somewhere between awful and merely silly, but I ended up enjoying myself thoroughly. Also, my 65-year-old father loves this movie, and he saw it only having heard vaguely of the Spice Girls, but not knowing their music at all. Yes, Spiceworld is an exploitation movie; BUT it does an excellent job at it! What I loved most was the way it poked fun at itself all the way through. The character of the screenwriter pitching his idea to the girls' manager (brilliantly played by Richard E. Grant) saying It's obvious to us that the Spicegirls are movie stars!, when it's obvious that they're not, and everyone knows it - there's even a scene at the beginning where he says, Yes, but can they ACT? and his boss responds with, 'Who cares?, or similar. I loved that. And while the girls CAN'T really act (some are worse than others; I've read that Victoria was the only one who had taken acting lessons before, but I can't say it showed since I thought she was the weakest link), it's obvious that they're having fun with the script, and they don't do too badly at all.The script was another great surprise to me; it's full of good lines and funny characters that poke fun at themselves and their stereotypes. An example of this is the great Roger Moore playing the Chief, who is presumably the Big Boss of the Spice Girls. We only ever see him on the phone with Clifford the manager (Richard E. Grant), and every time we do he is stroking, in pure Bond Villain (or Dr Evil) fashion, a small white animal on his lap. But every time you see him he has a different animal; first it's a cat, then a rabbit, a tiny white pig etc. I thought that was such a great way of poking fun at the stereotype of the villain always having a white pet. And then the character himself has these fantastically enigmatic, senseless, but hysterical lines, like When the rabbit of chaos is pursued by the ferret of disorder through the fields of anarchy, it is time to hang your pants on the hook of darkness. Whether they're clean or not. and The headless chicken can only know where he's been. He can't see where he's going. Do not be that chicken. I love that off-the-wall humour, and this movie is full of it. Of course, some people just don't GET that kind of humour, which is fine by me as long as it doesn't make them slam the film because of it.Other moments I love, which elevate this film from could-have-been-dodgy to funny, are the casting of Meatloaf as the Spice Girls bus driver, and then having him say lines like on fixing the clogged toilets Hey, I love these girls. I'll do anything for them...but I won't do that! - which is, of course, a play on Meatloaf's hit song Anything for Love. Also the parody of the stereotypical characters of the girls, which of course were made up for them anyway, like Victoria not knowing what to wear, and Mel C saying It must be really hard for you, Victoria, trying to decide whether to wear the little Gucci dress, or the little Gucci dress, or the little Gucci dress, and Victoria responding Exactly!, or when Victoria falls into the Thames and continues to scream for help once she's been rescued, and yelling This dress is dry-clean only!, or Geri saying Calm down, haven't you ever heard of the word 'compromisation'? There are scores of these great moments but they really work better in the film than if I wrote them down here. All I'm saying is that this movie is not ever in a million years as bad as everyone makes it out to be. Yes, it's not the greatest, but then most films aren't. It's so much funnier than you'd think, and yes it has its cheesy moments, but sometimes it's SUPPOSED to be cheesy! That's where it's funny. I really don't understand why this film, whose only aim was to be FUN, and in this it succeeded more than admirably in my opinion, is in IMDb's Worst.

Also the parody of the stereotypical characters of the girls, which of course were made up for them anyway, like Victoria not knowing what to wear, and Mel C saying It must be really hard for you, Victoria, trying to decide whether to wear the little Gucci dress, or the little Gucci dress, or the little Gucci dress, and Victoria responding Exactly!, or when Victoria falls into the Thames and continues to scream for help once she's been rescued, and yelling This dress is dry-clean only!, or Geri saying Calm down, haven't you ever heard of the word 'compromisation'? There are scores of these great moments but they really work better in the film than if I wrote them down here. All I'm saying is that this movie is not ever in a million years as bad as everyone makes it out to be. Yes, it's not the greatest, but then most films aren't. It's so much funnier than you'd think, and yes it has its cheesy moments, but sometimes it's SUPPOSED to be cheesy! That's where it's funny. I really don't understand why this film, whose only aim was to be FUN, and in this it succeeded more than admirably in my opinion, is in IMDb's Worst.

Sure it's no Lethal Weapon but it sure is a good action comedy that entertains well.The movie doesn't really have much story and even the little story elements that are present in the movie are far from interesting. It's weak and simple but yet the movie is made interesting and carried by Mel Gibson and Goldie Hawn, who have a surprising good chemistry and the many action sequences present in the movie, that are not the best you've ever seen but entertaining nevertheless.The movie serves its purpose well. The comedy elements in the movie work out well enough to make this an entertaining movie to watch. The characters aren't the best ever and are all quite formulaic but it's sort of fitting for a movie like this.Mel Gibson does a good job in this movie. Basically he in this movie plays a bit of the same way as he plays his Riggs character in the Lethal Weapon movies. No wonder, Gibson made this movie just after Lethal Weapon 2 and he clearly was in the mood for more. The result of that can be seen in this movie. He provides the movie certainly with a certain extra and gives the movie some extra fun. On top of that he and Goldie Hawn work pretty well as a screen duo, which does provide the movie with some of its best moments. Goldie Hawn herself is also surprising good in this movie and she shows that she can handle the genre. The villains are definitely a disappointing aspect about this movie. I mean when the main villains are being played by David Carradine and Bill Duke you would expect something more of it. The villains play a very little part in the movie and in it they get very little interesting to do. A waste of two fine actors. Some goes for the rest of the supporting cast.The movie is from 1990 but it still has an '80's feeling over it. Meaning lots of formulaic car chases, shootouts, haircuts and two main, 'buddy team', characters. Plus some horrible '80's music. I mostly hate Hans Zimmer score from the early '90's. They sound like '80's left overs.The movie is nothing too spectacular but it does has some great moments. Also the finale does not disappoint. The movie is professionally directed by John Badham, who never really made great movies but more movies that served their purpose always well.Nothing too great but the movie deserves a better reputation, since this is some great entertaining fun, to watch.7\/10http\/\/bobafett1138.blogspot.com\/ ","genre":null},{"date":"28 October 2006","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Yeah OK well the cover-art is horrible but the movie itself is actually quite pleasant and entertaining to watch.

The script is all about being bigger, louder & better than the original with one extravagant overblown set-piece after another. The film moves along like a rocket, in fact The Mummy Retrurns has to be one of the fastest paced films I've ever seen, there's barely a scene that goes by where there isn't a special effect, shoot-out, chase, explosion or some sort of action. As a result the character's are pretty shallow & I honestly don't know why Jonathan is back as he does nothing, I think in some ways they're as much of a passenger as we, the viewer, are. The story introduces all sorts of mythical Egyptian cities, legends & monsters & feels very much like an Indiana Jones globe-trotting action packed adventure with a hint of archaeology & horror thrown in there! Although The Mummy Returns is about as far removed from reality as any film can be so don't expect to learn anything, if you know what I mean. The Mummy Returns is big budget over-the-top entertainment that I thought was great fun & had had many enjoyable sequences although it's a little silly & a bit overlong at over two hours.Director Sommers does a good job, there's plenty of flashy CGI effects & some great action sequences. Everything looks great, the production design is top-notch as are the costumes, locations & period sets. The fights are well choreographed & I rather liked the the Scorpion King monster at the end even if the close-up special effects aren't the best. Not that it matters but if you look at Rachel Weisz's boots she wears throughout the film you'll notice how the heel changes between shots, sometimes she has high heels, then medium & then totally flat soles depending on what she has to do, however I'll cut her some slack as I don't think you could do back-flips in high heels without breaking your ankles...With a supposed budget of about $98,000,000 The Mummy Returns is well made & has that big budget Hollywood polish to it. The acting is almost incidental, it's not particularly good from anyone but it'll do. Is it just me or does anyone else think Rachel Weisz looks really hot in this?The Mummy Returns in my opinion is a great film, it moves along like a rocket & it has some terrific action scenes & special effects.

Baltus & his gang kidnap Alex & use him to show them the way to the Scorpion King, although Rick, Evelyn, Jonathan (John Hannah) & Ardeth Bay (Oded Fehr) are hot on their tails to save Alex & the world...Written & directed by Stephen Sommers The Mummy Returns was the sequel to the smash hit remake of The Mummy (1999) & in my opinion is a slightly better film. The script is all about being bigger, louder & better than the original with one extravagant overblown set-piece after another. The film moves along like a rocket, in fact The Mummy Retrurns has to be one of the fastest paced films I've ever seen, there's barely a scene that goes by where there isn't a special effect, shoot-out, chase, explosion or some sort of action. As a result the character's are pretty shallow & I honestly don't know why Jonathan is back as he does nothing, I think in some ways they're as much of a passenger as we, the viewer, are. The story introduces all sorts of mythical Egyptian cities, legends & monsters & feels very much like an Indiana Jones globe-trotting action packed adventure with a hint of archaeology & horror thrown in there! Although The Mummy Returns is about as far removed from reality as any film can be so don't expect to learn anything, if you know what I mean. The Mummy Returns is big budget over-the-top entertainment that I thought was great fun & had had many enjoyable sequences although it's a little silly & a bit overlong at over two hours.Director Sommers does a good job, there's plenty of flashy CGI effects & some great action sequences. Everything looks great, the production design is top-notch as are the costumes, locations & period sets. The fights are well choreographed & I rather liked the the Scorpion King monster at the end even if the close-up special effects aren't the best. Not that it matters but if you look at Rachel Weisz's boots she wears throughout the film you'll notice how the heel changes between shots, sometimes she has high heels, then medium & then totally flat soles depending on what she has to do, however I'll cut her some slack as I don't think you could do back-flips in high heels without breaking your ankles...With a supposed budget of about $98,000,000 The Mummy Returns is well made & has that big budget Hollywood polish to it. The acting is almost incidental, it's not particularly good from anyone but it'll do. Is it just me or does anyone else think Rachel Weisz looks really hot in this?The Mummy Returns in my opinion is a great film, it moves along like a rocket & it has some terrific action scenes & special effects. There's plenty of bang for your money here, definitely worth a watch & I reckon it's a highly entertaining film. After proving popular here The Rock got his own spin-off film The Scorpion King (2002) while on the back of The Mummy Returns the animated TV series The Mummy The Animated Series (2001) was made.

There can be no doubt that the movie is one of the best of all time, it's stars feed off each other in a macabre dance, best exemplified by the makeshift New Year's Eve Party. Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson) spins an artful web for Joe Gillis (Holden), the spider and the fly in this case need each other in a symbiotic relationship that will ultimately lead to doom for both.The characters themselves almost seem larger than life, a particular line by Desmond confirms it. When Gillis first recognizes her as a former silent film star who used to be big, she replies - I am big, it's the pictures that got small. That line lingers over the entire story the rest of the way, for a faded film queen with delusions of grandeur who can't recognize that her time is past. The card scene with Buster Keaton present adds further resonance to the masquerade, that was a great touch.Perhaps in a different way, Max von Mayerling's (Erich von Stroheim) story is just as compelling, the former husband turned butler who desperately trades loyalty for individuality. His time has also passed, but he manages to ride it out as nobly as he can. The finale when he takes over the direction of 'The Great Norma Desmond's' return is brilliantly conceived and movingly portrayed. Lights, camera, action, fade out - all smoke and mirrors where a fire once burned.It's interesting that Sunset Boulevard and All About Eve came out the same year, each casting a wary eye at their respective venues, Hollywood and Broadway. Following recent viewings of both, I would have awarded the Best Film Oscar to 'Sunset', a much darker film at heart with greater irony. Though not totally overlooked, the film failed to capture any of the 'big' awards, having to settle for recognition in writing, scoring and art direction. A thought came to me as I watched Holden's character packing his bags in an attempt to flee the madness. Can you picture the film a quarter century later with the benefit of an Eagles soundtrack - You can check out any time you like, but you can never leave.

Way before the first Klingon dictionary, I and I'm sure other boys my age, were trying to crack the code in case we ever ran into a giant robot of our own. But best of all was seeing the inside of a spaceship. Close Encounters of the Third Kind had its ending remade specifically because of this same sense of wonder, a peek inside and at the creatures is what every boy dreams of. This is what makes the ending of the original War of the Worlds so powerful as well. Nothing can replace that door sliding open and that sizzling, slithering, suction-cup hand coming out. Was I the only one who cocked my head trying to see further up into the ship? A great flight of fancy and a fancy flight of fun for any child of any age who has ever stared at the stars and wondered about the other beings made by the Almighty Spirit.

Frustratingly, it's hard to separate these two gifts it seems to be in his nature to continually push the envelope, and dare his audience to judge whether he is doing so with a straight face. Although still far-out by the standards of mainstream cinema, 'Breaking the Waves' is perhaps his most conventional English-language film; and also his best, a movie of rare emotional power. Dominated by a literally eye-rolling performance from Emily Watson in the lead role, the film also features a strong supporting cast including, among others, the late Katrin Cartlidge, unnervingly abrupt inter-cutting between scenes, the odd (but effective) division of the movie into chapters marked by musical interludes, and a fiercely imagined vision of life in western Scotland. If one looks away, one might the extreme nature of the story was constructed solely to shock; but to divert one's eyes from this mesmerising film would be a hard thing to do. Almost every scene is perfectly judged; only perhaps the very last image seems misplaced. von Trier's movies generally leave you gasping in both admiration and exasperation; but this one is among the finest, and most distinctive, movies of the 1990s compulsory viewing, but not for the weak.

For example, despite the challenged nature of his character in Forrest Gump, I felt if Tom Hanks said in a whiny, nasal, drawn-out voice, My Jennnnny, one more time I'd scream. Ditto for Brando's mumbling in On the Waterfront and A Streetcar Named Desire, and Harrison Ford's droll, quiet, dour musings in the Clancy flicks and much of his other work. Hanks and Ford are great actors, Brando one of the great icons, with numerous fine, 8-figure performances among them. But all have been noticeably, and sometimes annoyingly, over-the top, often.On the other hand, Al Pacino is an actor who can be over-the-top, and it not only seems natural, but even necessary - and makes his character and performance come to life more effectively, making the film better than it would have been otherwise.Scent of a Woman is a prime example. The part of the film with him driving the sports car speedily through Manhattan (albeit it on a weekend day with no competing traffic) is positively ludicrous, with no trace of real possibility - yet adds to the proceedings. (Certainly a blind person with a co-pilot could drive in some fashion, but never as depicted.)Pacino's mannerisms, speech and entire performance were on the one hand, overdrawn and exaggerated - but on the other, would have suffered with anything less.In real life, Pacino is not tall of stature, but like his predecessor, Alan Ladd, seems like he is 6-feet-tall or more on-screen, both physically and in the magnitude of his performances.

The story follows Frank around like it was Frank Zito! This is your life! This Frank Zito is carrying the movie, basically alone, we watch him sleep, we watch him stalk victims, he see him kill (of course.) But it's all about him. We learn nothing about his victims, there's no connection to the victims, nothing tying them together, one's a nurse, one's a hooker. His pattern doesn't make any sense, where are the Police during all this? Where's the Police Detective going, this pattern doesn't make any sense? When there is a serial killer, there is Policeman scratching his head. Where is the press? Where are the reporters calling this guy THE SCALPER or THE HEADHUNTER. That's the only pattern, him scalping them. Where are the forensics looking for fingerprints or the coroner, this movies leaves a whole lot out which makes it terribly boring and uninteresting. Frank Zito is not interesting enough of a character to carry the movie alone. If you just want to see a bloody gore fest with no substance or story, then I recommend MANIAC, but if you want story, not just a gory sleeping pill then avoid it at all cost.
