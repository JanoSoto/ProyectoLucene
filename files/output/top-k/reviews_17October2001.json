I was obviously mistaken. Don't get me wrong, the blondes are babes and this movie is a lot of fun, but I thought the movie itself had more depth than busty blondes. The movie actually has a lot to do with fitting in, dramatic times and being the best person you can be. This may all sound corny, but rarely is, and the comedy element is the most important one in the movie, so don't go in expecting a big drama-fest because the comedy kicks hard ass. As does Reese Witherspoon's awesome performance. She is seriously hot, smart and believable in this cool role as the blonde law student. Many are considering her Oscar material, and I couldn't agree more! Every scene Reese is in is an enjoyable one, and she gives the movie more charisma than anyone else. I also have to applaud the writers for coming up with a truly original idea for a script that brings up tonnes of laughs and cool ideas. The movie has knowledge about a lot of things &#150; guys, girls, perms (look out for this one, its classic!) and law school. I just really loved this movie and it was a great time out at the flicks. I haven't enjoyed a comedy so much this year since Bridget Jones's Diary or Heartbreakers. All in all, Legally Blonde is a highly recommendable movie that will appeal to all audiences.

Critics shower it with praise, it's full of great cinematography, has an excellent script, and if it's lucky, it picks up an Oscar nomination along the way. In many cases, this will be the film that I end up despising.  On the other hand, the opposite can be true.  Sometimes, a bad movie will be released.  The critics will destroy it.  It will be full of terrible dialogue, shabby acting, and undeveloped characters.  Of course, it goes without saying that this movie will rely on every film cliche in the proverbial book.  For some reason, however, I will enjoy it. `Autumn in New York,' starring Richard Gere and Winona Ryder, is a prime example of this unexplained phenomenon.  Gere stars as Will Keane, the womanizing owner of one of New York's classier gourmet restaurants.  Soon after the movie opens, Will falls for a younger woman (Ryder) who happens to be the daughter of an old friend.  After the age difference turns out to be inconsequential, Charlotte's revelation that she is terminally ill makes it clear that they have been forced into a doomed relationship from the start. This, compounded by Gere's hesitancy to abandon his Don Juan-ish ways make for turbulence throughout their time together.  A quasi-interesting subplot is thrown in concerning Keane's estranged daughter, and it serves to keep `Autumn' from falling into too many formulaic romance plots.There are so many reasons not to like `Autumn in New York.'  The first is obvious; no matter what lengths director Joan Chen goes to in order to keep the film original, she can't help but pour it into an overused mold. `Autumn' is a sappy movie about your standard ill-fated-from-the-start romance.  It wears its heart on its sleeve and begs you to be nice because, after all, it's about beautiful things like true love and a person's ability to improve himself.  People should watch it and cry because it's the kind of movie that is supposed to make people cry.  The script itself was a different issue altogether.  The dialogue sounded like it had been written by someone who had recently taken a very bad creative writing class.`I can smell the rain.  When did I learn to do that?' `Food is the only beautiful thing that truly nourishes.' Also, it seems that either Ryder's part was originally written for Drew Barrymore, or Drew's been giving Winona acting lessons recently.However, I should stop complaining, because I genuinely enjoyed this movie. First of all, we should give Joan Chen a few tries before we start tearing her works of art to shreds.  `Autumn' is the first English-language film Chen has attempted, so it appears that she's still getting her feet wet, and I can appreciate that.  Second of all, in spite of the movie's unoriginal nature, some aspects made it impossible not to enjoy.  What sticks in my mind are some of the most amazing visuals I have seen on the big screen in a very long time.  Chen's mastery of aesthetic cinematography is incredible. It seems that NYC's pigeon population has been completely replaced by doves. Why?  Because doves are pretty, that's why.  Many of the scenes seemed to be paintings brought to life. Be it a night scene in a Manhattan alleyway or a flyby of the Brooklyn Bridge, each shot is tailored perfectly to compose a balanced and artistic blend of actors and scenery, without once resorting to the standby shot of the New York skyline. Joan Chen does amazing things with even a few strands of glass beads. The characters, as stereotypical as they were, made me care about them, which is rare.  I was most impressed my J.K. Simmons' character, a surgeon called upon to help Ryder's character during the movie's second half.  Simmons, with no more than twenty lines, undoubtedly gave the best performance during the movie's entire 107 minutes, and I look forward to seeing him in larger roles. `Autumn in New York' is a painting.  It's a ballet or a classical choral piece.  It's a piece of beautiful art, if not a good story.  It forces us to think about things we don't always want to think about, but probably should.

The beauty of this is that `Memento' turned out to be a masterpiece among the no-account strips of celluloid passing for quality film that are currently in theaters.

Leonard suffers from short-term memory-loss, and is unable to keep a new memory for more than five minutes or so.  Hence the flashbacks.  We immediately discover that Leonard's wife has been murdered by `John G.,' and that Leonard is seeking vengeance.  The trouble, however, is that Leonard's condition forces him to rely on scribbled notes, tattooed messages covering his body, and his Polaroid camera to remind him where he is and what he is trying to accomplish.This is brilliant stuff.

Watching this movie is like HAVING short-term memory loss!Aside from having an insanely ingenious foundation, we're given a lot to chew on while the film zigs and zags in its attempts to shake our inner detectives.  Director Nolan gives us some great colorful characters, notably Teddy and Natalie (respectively, Joe Pantoliano and Carrie-Anne Moss, co-stars in `The Matrix'), who have both our sympathy and loathing through most of the film.

However, most of the laughs come mostly at your own expense when you realize you've completely been hoodwinked on more than one occasion. `Memento' is the best film currently in theaters.

It is more incredible that all the rest of the story.About forty minutes to the end... the Mohawk warrior give a strange allucinogen toad to a character (I think that really he give him an acid), and in this point of the story it seems like the toad was eaten by de writters!!!Good things of the movie-The photography.-Some action scenes (I wouldn´t use it in this movie, but I like it).-The wonderful female characters, particulary Monica Belucci´s one.Bad things of the movie-The story if you see it like a whole thing.-The one-arm-not-one-arm-armed-with-ancient-and-strange-oriental-weapon villain.-The absurd of XVIII century occidentals performing circular kickes and acrobatic leaps.Good for a boring (and long) afternoon.

Two glaring notes Gary Oldman and Sam Elliot, both of whom are good actors but seem hammy in comparison to the rest of the cast. (In fairness, Oldman has complained that the post-production process removed some of the ambiguity that he tried to express.) Also, this is the first 'political' movie that actually feels like real life. The protocols, the manners, the political dancing hits home as being quite authentic. Even when people are going for the jugular, it's done in an eerie, respectful way... just the way you see from watching committee meetings on C-SPAN.Now, what's wrong. In addition to the aforementioned one-sided political diatribe you have to endure, the mechanics of this movie simply make no sense. You have a president who has to decide who his new VP will be. He passes on one man for reasons which are not very compelling (although later you find out why his instincts were right) and picks a woman from his party's Senate contingent. He does this because she represents my politics. However, either the President has the worst investigators in history or employs staffers who are deliberately trying to undermine him. We are asked to believe that NO ONE ever vetted Laine to determine if there was anything embarrassing in her background. She couldn't have foreseen the photo, granted, but her affair with her best friend's husband, who is now HER husband, is another thing -- sorta like the smear done on Newt Gingrich, but you'll never catch this movie apologizing for that. So when Laine is attacked on these points, we get the it's nobody's business and if I were a man, no one would care treatment. On the other hand, when she's attacked on the basis of her rather extreme politics -- well, that's ALSO off-limits and hypocritical. I guess, then, the argument is that since she's a woman, she should get a free pass. Isn't that a double standard? And of course, the most ridiculous part of this is that the gold standard of this type of treatment was the Clarence Thomas hearings, where ten-year-old innuendos and unsubstantiated allegations that had nothing to do with his qualifications for the position were allowed to be used to lynch him in a manner MUCH more unprofessional than anything shown in this movie. But do you think the makers of this movie would be willing to draw that comparison? Oh, hell no. Conservatives are evil ... that's the moral standing for The Contender.Also, I would find it very difficult that a President would deliberately set up a governor of his own party to be exposed as a criminal fraud, even to score the bit of payback he gets out of it. Nor do I believe for a moment that a President would make that climactic speech during an open session of Congress -- not one that wanted any cooperation at all during the remaining part of his term. Nor did I find the plot twist of the antagonist's wife having a secret abortion particularly believable, especially in light of her speech about having to accept not having children as a price to pay for her husband's greatness. It was a clumsy attempt to paint all opposition to abortion-on-demand as hypocritical and dishonest. This would have been a great movie if any care had been taken to stick to the main point -- chauvinistic opposition to female leadership -- rather than drawing all these other unnecessary and divisive lines. It would be nice if these movies gave both sides the courtesy of acting like they operate from conviction and stop demonizing everyone with whom they disagree.

For a while, it appeared that this form of pseudo-art was being phased out of Hollywood, but apparently some stragglers remain.  Director Tommy O'Haver's classic of choice was `A Midsummer Night's Dream.'  He actually managed to hold things together relatively well, though the film was by no means a great one. `Get Over It' stars Ben Foster (of TV's `Freaks and Geeks') as Berke Lawrence, your average high school guy, who's been recently jilted by his longtime girlfriend Allison(Melissa Sagemiller).  As a testament to the evil inherent in the mind of the ex-girlfriend, Allison wastes no time in finding companionship with new student `Striker' Scrumfeld (Shane West), the former lead singer of a one-hit-wonder boy band.  In the spirit of Shakespeare, Berke's determination to win Allison back renders him impervious to the advances of his best friend's younger sister Kelly (Dunst).  In order to prove his devotion to Allison, Berke auditions for the school play, `A Midsummer Night's Rockin Eve,' and, I suppose, hilarity ensues. Keeping in mind that a creative teen comedy is about as easy to come by as a CU football victory, director O'Haver was at least able to keep me awake. Halfway original sight gags and surprisingly decent acting from Foster and Colin Hanks (son of Academy-Award nominee Tom), who plays Kelly's older brother, keep the movie from going the way of `10 Things I Hate About Julia Stiles.'

Apparently, though, Hollywood seems to have a fixation with perverts, so I have to keep writing about them. This week's waste of time is `The Glass House,' directed by Daniel Sackheim.  Leelee Sobieski is on board as Ruby Baker, a spoiled teenager from San Fernando Valley.  When she and her brother are orphaned, family friends Terry and Erin Glass (Stellan Skaarsgard and Diane Lane, respectively) take them in and promise them a life of luxury in their Malibu home.  When I say luxury, I mean attempted murder, drug abuse and sexual harassment. I had to laugh a little when I first visited the film's site on the Internet Movie Database (www.imdb.com).  The viewer comments section is headlined by the quote `Atmospheric and chilling.  A wonderful movie.'Atmospheric, yes.  Chilling?  Not so much.  Wonderful?  Maybe , if you compare it to `Bio-Dome.' `The Glas House' is Daniel Sackheim's first Hollywood attempt, though he's had plenty of experience in the world of television.  His previeous works have included `Judging Amy' as well as several TV movies, and it shows. Aside from the fact that the thing looks like it belongs on `Lifetime,' it's an unfortunate rip-off of such second-rate films as `The Hand the Rocks the Cradle' or `Fear.'  One one hand, there are some great visuals.  Glass, creatively enough, is the cinematography's constant focus, and I challenge you to find a single shot that doesn't include some form of glass or another. Breaking glass, privacy glass, Terry Glass.  You know, it looks really nice, but this kind of film could use a little more subtlety.  We also get a number of self-indulgent `Look, I'm a Director!' shots; i.e., a close-up shot of a dilating pupil, closet interior point-of-view, and of course, the dolly-in\/zoom out `Vertigo' effect. Cliché after cliché is thrown in our faces.  `Hey, she keeps sketching at the dinner table.  Gotta wonder if that's gonna pay off later on.'  It's Sackheim's first try, and he doesn't let us forget it.  He wants badly to look like an artist, but his work is better suited to after-school specials.Leelee Sobieski was mediocre enough, but her name is Leelee, and I'm not sure how to feel about that.

So I wasn't exactly kicking back on my living room couch with a glass of soda at my side, enjoying the show.  Well, I did enjoy the show--a lot!--but in a somewhat analytical way. I'll start off by complimenting the acting.  Frances McDormand earned a well-deserved Oscar for her performance as a pregnant police chief in this small, quiet Minnesota town.  You can say this is the role that put her on the map, and I'm glad she's on the map, because she's a very talented actress.  William H. Macy never ceases to please, delivering a subtle performance as a money-hungry car salesman.  Just his facial expressions alone speak a million words.  Steve Buscemi is absolutely hilarious as the talkative Carl.  He's superb at anything he does, and I think this marks one of most memorable appearances on film.  Peter Stormare is subtlely terrifying as his silent buddy.  I don't think they could've picked someone with a more piercing stare than him.  At moments you actually feel as if you're staring at the Angel of Death himself, he's so effective.  His name escapes me at the moment, but I loved the Asian guy who played McDormand's old friend.  He has one of the most hilarious scenes in the film.  I remembered him as a worker for Rolling Stone in Almost Famous--also with McDormand in the cast.  He really is good!  The cinematography is great!  It really brings out the coldness (both literally and figuratively) of the setting.  The music is brilliant and haunting.  The dialogue is full of zingers that film buffs will have a field day with.  I heard that people from Minnesota wrote angry letters about the Coens (who were actually born and raised in the state) for making fun of the way their people talk.  I know they must've exaggerated (I don't see how anybody can talk like that without laughing at themselves), but they must've used some element of truth.  You know what they say  There has to be truth to every joke.  I didn't think there are people in the world who can be so stoic and cheerful, even when there's a murder taking place.

Hey, I'm from Jersey and talk nothing like the characters in The Sopranos, and I'm not complaining.  I can take a joke.  I think the extremely mild manner of the main characters (minus Buscemi and Stormare) helps create an ironic tone that contradicts the atmosphere. Fargo has almost anything you can ask for in a movie.  It's a dark comedy, and in that department it's hilarious.  In fact--keeping in mind that this was marketed as a drama\/thriller--I think I got more laughs out of this film than most straight comedies I've seen.  Of course, some may think you're a sadist for laughing at certain gags, but we don't always have to laugh at pleasant things, do we?

The idea of a film about high school cheerleaders initially scared me to death.  I expected `Clueless' with pompoms- and I was worried that I was going to have to write yet another unpleasant review. Soon after the release of `Bring it On,' however, I heard that not only did it star my soul mate Kirsten Dunst, but that it was directed by Peyton Reed, who also created Comedy Central's `Upright Citizens Brigade.'  Needless to say, my interest was piqued.I'm pleased to say that I don't feel any dumber for having watched it. In fact, I enjoyed it.  Now, this isn't to say that `Bring it On' is a life changing experience full of amazing dialogue and creative cinematography. It's not- but it is an entertaining movie that doesn't pander to the lowest common denominator.  It's a satire, and watched as a satire, it's a fun film that I could probably watch a couple times.The plot isn't exactly majestic, but does a good job of presenting the film's satirical elements while managing to slip in a few remarks about race relations.  Upon being named the new cheer captain, Torrance Shipman (Dunst) discovers that her squad's last five national titles have been won unfairly; the former captain had stolen the winning routines from inner-city East Compton High.  Of course, the girls of Rancho Carne (meat ranch) High School are forced to take the reigns and come up with something innovative to prove that they have what it takes to defend their title.`Bring it On' opens with a sardonic look at suburbia's love\/hate relationship with cheerleaders, which sets the tone for the rest of the movie (one colorful character refers to cheerleaders as `dancers gone retarded').  Director Reed and screenwriter Jessica Bendinger have done an admirable job of making San Diego's fictional Rancho Carne (meat ranch) High School seem at least a little bit like the high schools we all know. Without focusing too much on stereotypes and cliques that teen filmmakers seem to love these days, they have created some believable characters and managed to throw in a little love story to boot.While the film lacks profound meaning, the entertaining parts stick with you.  Early on, one of the cheerleaders breaks a leg, and a tryout is held to find her replacement.  Along with presenting one of the film's significant characters, the scene is funnier than all get out.  About halfway through the fim, in a surprisingly poignant spectacle, Dunst and newbie Jesse Bradford brush their teeth side-by-side. Not a word is spoken, but somehow the act of gargling and spitting corroborates a mutual crush between the two characters, and becomes one of the most memorable scenes in `Bring it On.'Of course, it's a feel-good movie, but at least it's not a dumbed-down feel-good movie.  I'll confess, my undying devotion to Kirsten Dunst may make me slightly biased.  Honestly, though, I believe that the reason I enjoyed it as much as I did is that it could have been so much worse.  Now that we know that Peyton Reed has the talent to keep things interesting, hopefully in the future he will tackle a more engaging subject.

Now, this isn't to say that `Bring it On' is a life changing experience full of amazing dialogue and creative cinematography. It's not- but it is an entertaining movie that doesn't pander to the lowest common denominator.  It's a satire, and watched as a satire, it's a fun film that I could probably watch a couple times.The plot isn't exactly majestic, but does a good job of presenting the film's satirical elements while managing to slip in a few remarks about race relations.  Upon being named the new cheer captain, Torrance Shipman (Dunst) discovers that her squad's last five national titles have been won unfairly; the former captain had stolen the winning routines from inner-city East Compton High.  Of course, the girls of Rancho Carne (meat ranch) High School are forced to take the reigns and come up with something innovative to prove that they have what it takes to defend their title.`Bring it On' opens with a sardonic look at suburbia's love\/hate relationship with cheerleaders, which sets the tone for the rest of the movie (one colorful character refers to cheerleaders as `dancers gone retarded').  Director Reed and screenwriter Jessica Bendinger have done an admirable job of making San Diego's fictional Rancho Carne (meat ranch) High School seem at least a little bit like the high schools we all know. Without focusing too much on stereotypes and cliques that teen filmmakers seem to love these days, they have created some believable characters and managed to throw in a little love story to boot.While the film lacks profound meaning, the entertaining parts stick with you.  Early on, one of the cheerleaders breaks a leg, and a tryout is held to find her replacement.  Along with presenting one of the film's significant characters, the scene is funnier than all get out.  About halfway through the fim, in a surprisingly poignant spectacle, Dunst and newbie Jesse Bradford brush their teeth side-by-side. Not a word is spoken, but somehow the act of gargling and spitting corroborates a mutual crush between the two characters, and becomes one of the most memorable scenes in `Bring it On.'Of course, it's a feel-good movie, but at least it's not a dumbed-down feel-good movie.  I'll confess, my undying devotion to Kirsten Dunst may make me slightly biased.  Honestly, though, I believe that the reason I enjoyed it as much as I did is that it could have been so much worse.  Now that we know that Peyton Reed has the talent to keep things interesting, hopefully in the future he will tackle a more engaging subject.  I give the cheerleading comedy `Bring it On' a `C+'  Feel free to make that a `B' if you're a cheerleader, a fourteen year old male, or a Kirsten Dunst worshipper.  ","genre":"Comedy, Sport"}]
