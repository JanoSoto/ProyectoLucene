It is more original and gives the movie more flavor. This is why most of these teen romance flicks are not really big at the box office. Its because they are predictable, they have been done a thousand times before and because everyone knows how it will turn out. That is why horror movies are always big. Because at least with a horror movie you usually have to figure out who the masked killer is or something like that. But with these boring teen comedies, you always know how it will turn out. This movie is different.You never really know what is going to happen, because this movie takes the honor of having a very large cast of characters and follows each of them very specifically, developing a story and history for each of them.

It has never been done before. Many of the smaller cliches have been done before, but not the basic plot. It is very original and is perfect for creating elaborate situations and jokes.

There are sooo many people who automatically don't like a story because it doesn't spell it out for them right away.  You might actually have to think to fully grasp the whole of this movie.  This is hard for some people to do, for whatever reason.  Maybe they just weren't expecting this from a action movie.I've seen many people reference to Christien connections to The Matrix. True, true.  (names of characters, story of jesus) And all of this was put in there on purpose.  This was the brothers' fist big project so they put a lot of time into fitting all of these underlying messages in.  What many people do not know, however, is that it is actually ment to be more budhist than christian.  But, since the religions have similar storylines and the majority of people that this movie reaches are Christian, people tend to notic just the christian allegories.  I haven't even mentioned the philosophical end.  If  you are interested, try looking into Descartes and Kant.  If you are really interested, you can try some greek mythology, because that is deffinetly going to show up in the next parts of the trilogy.

Here are the reasons why The first film just didn't seem like Mortal Kombat, even though it was a good film, but Mortal Kombat Annihilation seems to surpass it in the action, and depiction. Annihilation follows the games a lot more, because they feature more characters that are from the games, more moves that are from the game, and definitely the characters of Scorpion and Sub-Zero have better suits, but I suppose that they had crap suits in the first one because they had bad suits in the first game, I don't know. The first film Sub-Zero's ice ball, or freeze maneuver, was over exaggerated a lot. In the games, it does not take that long for him to produce an ice ball. In Annihilation, he just does it like in the game. Sonya, in here uses her trademark move, the kiss of death, but in this installment, it has a different effect than in the games. The choreography was also very good, I thought so. Lots of people say that the fight scenes were overhauled by cheesiness, but I really don't understand why they say that. The acting is definitely what you would expect in these types of films, good, and imperfect. Sometimes the acting would be overhauled by the cheesy screenplay. The scene where Sub-Zero first makes an appearance is a good example. Sub-Zero says some crap to Liu Kang, I forgot what, something like, You killed my brother in the first tournament, and now you will have to fight again, something like that, I forgot. The screenplay can only be cheesy sometimes, but its not all that bad. Another example of a cheesy screenplay, is Scorpion uttering out the word Suckers! instead of Get over here!. Like I said, the acting isn't bad, its just what you would expect in a typical action\/adventure flick. The story seems to remain the same, just with new characters, and new threat, but overall, I don't give a crap about the story. Character costumes, like I mentioned earlier, are very good, but that only applies to characters that have the same ninja outfit as Scorpion and Sub-Zero, because characters like Cyrax, and Smoke, look terrible. It was clear that their chest protectors were made out of plastic, and their masks look terrible as well. I basically described the entire movie, so I'll tell you the things that I really didn't like about the film. Her it goes They took out Bridgett Wilson, she was hotter than the other girls who played as Sonya. They took out Christopher Lambert, and replaced him with this weird guy, and to top it off, they give Raiden a damn flat-top!

I realized very early on in the movie that the way these people spoke French (particularly the narrator, André Dussollier) was so pleasant to listen to that being dubbed over in English simply would not have done the original dialogue justice.  The manner in which Amélie finds her destiny (bringing happiness to others) was cleverly laid out in an original sequence of events that leaves you thinking.

One of them was a boy named Jesse Walsh and two girls. Suddenly, the bus picks up speed and heads into the middle of the desert. Freddy Krueger appears at the wheel and the whole experience ends in a cliffhanger. Literally. Jesse awakens screaming in bed. Jesse, his parents Ken and Cheryl and little sister Angela are new to Elm street. Jesse hasn't even unpacked his room yet and has trouble fitting in at school. The surly Coach Schneider makes him and troublemaker Ron Grady run laps and do push-ups. Jesse has a friend, Lisa, whom rides to school with him. That night, Jesse has a dream and is confronted by Freddy Krueger who tells him to kill for him.        The next day, Lisa comes over and helps Jesse unpack. That wasn't initially planned but Ken said Jesse couldn't go anywhere until his room was unpacked. Lisa found an old diary in the closet that belonged to the previous owner of the house Nancy Thompson. Jesse and Lisa read about Nancy's encounters with Freddy Krueger five years ago and how she saw Glen Lantz brutally murdered across the street. Freddy visits Jesse again that night. It seemed Freddy wasn't out to kill him but rather take over his body so he could continue his bloody rampage in life. At school he told Grady about it, but Grady assumed Jesse was nuts. He also spoke ill of Coach Schneider who over-heard him and made he and Jesse do push-ups. That evening, something strange happened. Just as Cheryl dropped the cover over the birds' cage, one bird kills the other one then swoops around the room, trying to attack the family then it suddenly bursts into flames and crashes down dead. Ken blames Jesse for that. That night, Jesse sneaks out and goes to a night club. Coach Schneider discovers him there and makes him run laps around the gymnasium then told him to hit the showers. Then suddenly, basketballs, tennis balls, medicine balls, volley balls and weights fly at Coach, then he's dragged to the shower room, his hands are tied to an overhead pipe by a jump rope, then towels snap him. Freddy then appears and slashes him to death and he accomplished it in Jesse's body.        Jesse thinks he's going crazy. That morning, the toaster caught fire which was strange considering it wasn't even plugged in. He and Lisa travel to the old Springwood power plant where Freddy worked in life and learn his grisley past. Soon, Lisa throws a party one night. Everyone from school comes except Grady. Jesse wasn't having much fun for he knew Freddy was inside him and was just waiting for the right moment to strike. He ran to Grady's and asked for him to watch him as he slept so nothing strange would happen. Suddenly, Jesse transformed into Freddy who killed Grady. He then went to Lisa's party and terrorized some teens and killed others. Lisa knew Jesse was still alive within Freddy and had a showdown with him at the power plant. She ovethrew Freddy who melted away and Jesse was back! Things were finally back to normal. But Freddy was far from being vanquished permanently...       Though not as good as the original, A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 Freddy's Revenge is still interesting. Robert Englund is back as the maniacal Freddy Krueger. Why do they keep calling him Fred? I think Freddy Krueger sounds much better. It just rolls right off the tongue. Jack Sholder takes over the director's chair in this one, though Wes Craven did a great job last time; I hear Freddy Krueger and Jason Voorhees will go one on one in Freddy Vs. Jason this summer.

Jesse, his parents Ken and Cheryl and little sister Angela are new to Elm street. Jesse hasn't even unpacked his room yet and has trouble fitting in at school.

That night, Jesse has a dream and is confronted by Freddy Krueger who tells him to kill for him.        The next day, Lisa comes over and helps Jesse unpack. That wasn't initially planned but Ken said Jesse couldn't go anywhere until his room was unpacked. Lisa found an old diary in the closet that belonged to the previous owner of the house Nancy Thompson. Jesse and Lisa read about Nancy's encounters with Freddy Krueger five years ago and how she saw Glen Lantz brutally murdered across the street. Freddy visits Jesse again that night. It seemed Freddy wasn't out to kill him but rather take over his body so he could continue his bloody rampage in life. At school he told Grady about it, but Grady assumed Jesse was nuts. He also spoke ill of Coach Schneider who over-heard him and made he and Jesse do push-ups. That evening, something strange happened. Just as Cheryl dropped the cover over the birds' cage, one bird kills the other one then swoops around the room, trying to attack the family then it suddenly bursts into flames and crashes down dead. Ken blames Jesse for that. That night, Jesse sneaks out and goes to a night club. Coach Schneider discovers him there and makes him run laps around the gymnasium then told him to hit the showers. Then suddenly, basketballs, tennis balls, medicine balls, volley balls and weights fly at Coach, then he's dragged to the shower room, his hands are tied to an overhead pipe by a jump rope, then towels snap him. Freddy then appears and slashes him to death and he accomplished it in Jesse's body.        Jesse thinks he's going crazy. That morning, the toaster caught fire which was strange considering it wasn't even plugged in. He and Lisa travel to the old Springwood power plant where Freddy worked in life and learn his grisley past. Soon, Lisa throws a party one night. Everyone from school comes except Grady. Jesse wasn't having much fun for he knew Freddy was inside him and was just waiting for the right moment to strike. He ran to Grady's and asked for him to watch him as he slept so nothing strange would happen. Suddenly, Jesse transformed into Freddy who killed Grady. He then went to Lisa's party and terrorized some teens and killed others. Lisa knew Jesse was still alive within Freddy and had a showdown with him at the power plant. She ovethrew Freddy who melted away and Jesse was back! Things were finally back to normal. But Freddy was far from being vanquished permanently...

It was a model of a house she had seen in her dreams which closely resembled the Elm Street house that was occupied by Nancy Thompson 6 years ago. The house was now abandoned. Kristen went to sleep and dreamed she was in the house and was soon confronted by Freddy Krueger. She woke up screaming and went into the bathroom. She was still dreaming because the sink attacked her then Freddy appeared and sliced her wrists. Kristen's mom figured Kristen sliced her own wrists so she had her checked into a psychiatric clinic where Kristen freaked out and attacked doctors and orderlies in the examination room. Luckily she was brought down by a new colleague, dream researcher Nancy Thompson! Nancy then meets Dr. Neil Gordon who introduces her to all the patients Phillip, a sleepwalker, Roland Kincaid who was known for throwing violent fits so he spent most of his time in a padded room. Other patients were Will Stanton who was in a wheel chair, Joey who was unable to speak, Jennifer who dreamed one one day being an actress, and Taryn who is a street punk. She also met Max the head orderly and surly group doctor, Dr. Elizabeth Simms.That night, Freddy paid a visit to Phillip. He mutated from one of Phillip's clay dolls then slashed Phillip's arms and legs and tied strings around them and walked him around like a puppet. This didn't seem strange to anyone because Phillip was a sleepwalker. Freddy walked Phillip right off the edge of the chapel tower and he fell to his death. Dr. Gordon and Dr. Simms concluded it was suicide but Nancy and the other patients felt otherwise. The following night, Freddy visited Jennifer and gave her her big break in television. Literally. At Jennifer's funeral, Neil met a nun named Sister Mary Helena who he had seen around from time to time. Nancy wanted to put the patients on a dream supressant drug and Neil reluctantly agreed. She then wanted everyone to band together to go into their dreams and stop Freddy so they use group hypnosis. It appeared not to work but it must have because Will was able to walk. He did in his dreams and in their dreams, Kristen was a gymnist and Taryn was a beauty and a beast and Kincaid had super strength. Suddenly, Freddy appeared. He captured Joey just as Dr. Simms burst in and woke everybody up, except for Joey who was in a coma. Simms told the head doctor, Dr. Carver everything so he fired Neil and Nancy. Kristen threw a fit so she was thrown into the padded room. Neil met with Sister Helena again who told him of an inmate that was once locked within the tower over vacation and was raped by over a hundred maniacs and was found with child. The woman was named Amanda Krueger. Her son, Freddy, was the bastard son of over a hundred maniacs! That certainly explains alot. She also tells him that one way to destroy Freddy would be to bury his remains in hallowed ground. Neil raced off to find Freddy's bones with Nancy's father, Lt. Donald Thompson while Nancy raced back to the clinic to save the kids.Neil and Donald go to an auto yard and find Freddy's bones in an old car and are about to bury them when the cars came to life along with Freddy's skeleton. Donald is killed in the process. Back at the clinic, Nancy, Kristen, Kincaid, Taryn, and Will entered the dream realm. Freddy killed Will and Taryn. Then Joey came to the rescue and could talk! But Freddy reappeared and stabbed Nancy. Luckily in the real world, Neil successfully buried Freddy's remains so in the dream realm, Freddy glowed brightly and disappeared. At Nancy's funeral, Neil discovered that Sister Helena WAS in fact Amanda Krueger!Another good Nightmare on Elm Street movie. It's a little better than Part 2.
