I wish I had been alive during this time so I could have seen this and the original and all the subsequent sequels on the big screen. Alas I was not born until 1985 and have only seen Jason x and Freddy Vs Jason through the light of a projector bulb. This film however is a little less impactive then it's predecessor. This film was rushed and it shows. The dialog is the worst in the series and this includes the fifth installment when I say this. It looks as if when Miner was told he was to direct this he only had like a week to cast because this cast seems as if they don't have clue. Amy Steele is the only one shows any sign of comprehension to the script. She is a lovely successor to Adrianne King who does reprieve her role here, if only for short time, making her inly the forth actor in the series to do so, so far. Steele however works well with what she is given (not much). All she is able to do is run and scream. Her speech about Jason's past in the bar scene is marvelous. That is the only insight we are given about Jason in this film and that is what holds this and the next installment back. The film should have delved into the Jason mythology and now it would be harder for the current directors to screw it up. Miner himself is a incompetent director who takes liberties with characters that are not his own, even if it is against the fans wishes. This is most evident in his film Halloween H-2-0 where he only works to the lowest common denominator of people. That being teeny boppers and jocks. The earliest signs of what is come from Miner can be seen in this film. He chooses not to tie up any of the plot threads of the previous Friday and leave it to other directors.

This also had to do with the fact that when I was young, my brothers and I suffered from a somewhat rare affliction known as Night Terrors. Since I am an identical triplet, and often all three of us would wake up screaming at the same time, my mother's hair turned Gray by the time I was five years old. When I saw the sequel to this movie, nightmares were already a prevalent theme in my life... they were almost more real than what I was experiencing when I was awake... And for years after, the antagonist in my dreams took on the form of Freddy Krueger. Unlike the characters in Dream Warriors, however, I could bend the reality of my dreams in many, many ways rather than having only one dream power. Because of this, Freddy never got the better of me in my dreams, I always would viciously slay him. And for a child who had only seen images of violence outside my dreams in this single film, it was just as scary to see myself do these things. I became obsessed later in life with the films and when I saw the sequel that had first introduced me to the series I found it tame in comparison... the one element that still stood out in my mind though, was the talented screamer who played Jesse. TRULY terrifying screams. Of all of the movies the original still stands out as the scariest for me, because No one really knows whats going on, there is never a survivor from the last film to explain what was happening, or to lend a shred of hope that one person might perhaps make it to the next film. The fact that everyone seems to believe Nancy is crazy at best lends to the fear that she will soon die. In doing research on the film to trace Wes's original inspiration, I found it documented that he said a series of articles he read in Los Angeles started the idea going. HOWEVER, I also found out that Wes went to Wheaton College for a time, which I lived near... and had friends on the somewhat close by Elm Street... as I still do... I believe that this is actually where the name of the film came from, and possibly some of the story.

I re-watched it the next day and was still disappointed. Aside from the Viggo gratuitous nudity, this movie is almost unwatchable. The acting and direction is bad, the filming is worse, and the soundtrack is the worst I have ever heard. The casting is atrocious. (Especially Vince Vaughan as the lead! He has absolutely no subtlety to his acting style. And the strangely placed peals of laughter only made him seem silly, not scary.) Every single character was mis-cast.At least, this would have been my review if I hadn't watched the original the following evening. After seeing the original, I have to say this version is even worse than I previously thought.The dialog is *exactly* the same as the original (including a modern verbalization of Well, I declare in a heavy Southern accent) and even the music score is almost identical (I think they just re-made all the same background music). The original movie is subtle and intense, frightening and realistic, with a sense of impending horror. The acting is impeccable and the score is perfect (since it was made at a time when that music fit). And, of course, Anthony Perkins is amazing in the lead.Even if I had expected an exact rip-off of the original movie while watching this version, I still would have hated it. It was just plain bad.

The definition of that decade being do everything Quick, Fast, and Cheap. This type of film making can be seen by almost all films of the decade unless it was made by Spielberg or Lucas or any of there clones. This movie (Friday The 13th) was shot for around $400,000 and made almost 50 million. That is a business procedure that still goes on today. Shoot cheap advertise well and the audience will come regardless of the film's integrity. Except this film has integrity unlike Roger Cormen films from the 50's on which were made just for profit. Yes I know that is in fact how this film started but that is not what it ended up being when the final project was shown before a projector bulb.

Le Gross is the main reason to watch this if you must and not QT as he just lies around sulking up the scenery, same as Jim Belushi. While Le Gross is wily and dirty looking in this film just like a latter film he did Highway Hitcher he just looks bad but really hes not and it's shame his one claim to fame is Phantasm II. Even though Mike Baldwin did a better job Le Gross worked well with what he had in that film. He deserves better than this, so I will give the film three stars because I feel sorry for him.

Also, there were way too many introspection\/angst scenes of the convict's moll thrown in to the story to give it psychological suspense. What it did was make it look phony. Violent criminals or their molls don't question their every move as she did in this film, they just impulsively do it, that's why they are criminals and convicts who wind up dead or in prison just like in this film! That rang fake and just muddled up a very simple crime story(and one that has been told many times so much better). We are now way too sophisticated in our film viewing to consider this to be anything more than cheap studio pap churned out like TV in the days just before TV. It doesn't hold up at all today.Way too many story inconsistencies and mistakes to mention but here's a big one....in the beginning how did the police know that Ann's convertible was stolen by the escaped prisoner when she nor nobody else reported it stolen by him, as she was in the car with the convict? Mental telepathy? And, the police even had part of the license number that they got from somewhere or someone never divulged. Just too many dumb things like that thrown into the story that demanded big leaps of faith and suspension of disbelief. Those kind of dumb things littered the film throughout and ruined it.

It was that bad.Journeyman actor Dennis O'Keefe was fair enough as the escaped convict, but the really good parts were John Ireland and Raymond Burr as tough hoods.

And Margot talked about the Salkinds or something publicly about the Salkinds firing Donner.So...They kept her pretty low profile in Superman III, saying she took a Vacation to Bermuda.

What really stuck out was the mythic quality of it all, and even at a young age the undeniably sexual overtones in the exchanges between the Lord of Darkness and Lily. I think people don't give kids enough credit but they do pick up on these things. I remember being taken aback when Lily's character dons the rather revealing dress late in the film and being shocked at her general demeanor afterwards; how her personality seems to change. All seemed right in the world when Jack and Lily return to their platonic relationship at film's end! Having viewed the director's cut recently I've found my own perspective has changed dramatically with time but I still like this movie for much the same reasons. A lot of the intensity I felt seeing it back then must've been due to my age, and feeling one with the character of Jack -- something I can sadly no longer do. The fight scenes play out to me rather comically now but back then they were frightening. Its a testament to Scott's direction that this film wasn't too violent for children, while really walking the line of what is acceptable.The Lord of Darkness make-up is simply outstanding and has only recently been topped with the likes of Hellboy. Once I was old enough to understand it was in fact an actor in a suit I was blown away to learn its actually Tim Curry underneath all that. There's no shortage of wonder on display here, but I think his was just the perfect idealization of evil, or Satan, EVER put to film.Overall the director's cut leans a little towards the over-long side, and while I haven't heard the tangerine dream score in years I'm sure it suits this '80s fantasy better than a stuffy orchestral score. But as Scott says in the commentary, it is an operatic film and that is how I see it now; almost more like a ballet or a play than a historical fiction like Lord of the Rings. Thank god I was in good hands, or I may have been turned off of fantasy forever! This is one to be passed down, and I look forward to seeing it light up the eyes of my future children.

Yes its intelligent, yes its very well crafted but all the same it really only demonstrates to me that Stephen Soderbergh doesn't know how to handle emotion. The film follows a number of parallel story-lines, all of which follow the central theme of drug-running. Many characters in the film are on collision courses with each other, men and women who have really forgotten who they are.The storyline sounds very promising. Maybe there is an exceptional movie in Traffic somewhere. But this definitely isn't it. For example one of the story-lines follows the tale of a U.S. Drug czar (Michael Douglas) who slowly comes to realise that maybe not all is right at home. His final speech at the end of the film is indicative of his story on the whole yes its very intelligent, but at the same time it leaves you cold. Its too cerebral there's really no tragedy, or even the slightest hint of emotion in the tale. The film gets you thinking, but not for very long. Themes come first, characters later, creating a cinematic experience that while enlightening us, never shocks or touches us.Another one of the story lines that left me unmoved was the tale of a Mexican cop (Benicio Del Toro) who takes on a powerful drug runner. Although there is a lot of potential there for a great story its never really used to its full potential. We never get to know the character he's incredibly distant, almost forgotten by the film at its finale. There's not enough there for us to become convinced that he's a real hero. Although one would be foolish to call the character a villain, he never really inspires us at all.The film would have worked wonderfully had it been a documentary, following the real life story of drug addicts or drug runners. Maybe then Soderbergh would have had an excuse for leaving us so untouched by the end of the film. He could have claimed the movie was only meant to make us think, not immerse us in these characters lives. Nevertheless the direction is pretty amazing. Soderbergh has a wonderful eye for beautiful images and colour schemes. As I've said before, its just sad that he just can't handle character's lives. Steve Gaghan went on to do wonderful things with Syriana. This film however, is a major letdown for the writer. Maybe he's the one to blame his story keeps us distant from the characters, never really revealing anything about their lives or motivations. They're cold figures on the horizon, nothing more, nothing less.This was one of those films I just wish I could have loved.

Some go out with a bang (Lord of the Rings), some get progressively weaker (The Matrix), some get lost in obscurity (Blade, Back to the Future), but some maintain the genius, that seemingly ever-growing bright light that floats beyond the surface of its flawless exterior. Case and point Three Colors Trilogy. This chapter in the trilogy, being the last one, is the most philosophical and thought-provoking. In Blue we had a more visually stunning, more character-driven plot, in White it was more of a light hearted, narrative-driven story where we listen more to what the characters say than anything. Red, however is focused on the what ifs and how comes. It questions our own fate and focuses mainly on the past and the future than the present.This chapter is about a young model who runs over a dog and brings him back to his owner. She soon finds out that the owner of the dog is actually a cynical retired judge who spies on his neighbors' phone calls through advanced spying equipment. All three films in the trilogies have very basic plot lines, but bring a lot more to the story. Consider in Blue, the story of a woman dealing with the loss of her loved ones. We are constantly shown ideas about the contemporary French society and how that reflects the character's behavior. Red is not only about a young woman who finds shelter in an older man's life, but it is also about chance, hope, and fate.Irene Jacob stars as Valentine Dussaut, who at first finds the old man (Jean-Louis Trintignant), whom we never find the name of, extremely self-centered and disgusting. Though through self reflective analysis, and her voyeuristic intentions, she learns that the judge would be the perfect man for her, if only he was 40 years younger. Irene lives across from another, younger judge, who highly resembles the old man. This is the what if that keeps circling in the movie. What if Irene were born 40 years ago? The old man would have been her perfect match. But what if the younger judge is actually her perfect match, since he so closely resembles the older one. Valentine doesn't know this, only we do, and Krzysztof Kieslowski subtly suggests this in almost every frame which Irene is in. We are constantly smacked in the face with his presence, as almost a suggestion of Irene's fate.I mention that the old man does not have a name for a reason. That reason is because it is very symbolic to the overall theme in the story. We are to compare the old judge to Auguste (Jean-Pierre Lorit), the younger judge, in more than one way. We learn that the old man once had someone he loved but she got away. In another scene, we see Auguste heartbroken as the love of his life gets away with another man. There are constant reminders of whether or not Valentine will ever meet this man. Even though they pass each other without noticing every single day. There is also the motif of the telephone, to Valentine it is a way of keeping sane and updating her life, to Auguste it is what leads to his heartbreak, and to the old man, it is the only thing he has left. These three elements serve to shadow the characters own psychology. It is a sort of statement about what they are and who they are.All three Colors films stand for a certain principle, most common in France. Blue stands for Liberty (the personal being), White stands for Equality (being accepted by more than one), and Red is Fraternity (to socialize, to learn). And although this final chapter is an obvious focus on the Fraternity principle, Kieslowski makes sure he brings in the other two as well, in order to connect all three stories. For example, we see the old man trying to reach out to Valentine and enlighten her with his spy equipment, which is a reflection of the Equality principle. We also see near the end that Valentine is doing some soul searching and that she's more concerned about herself than others (not picking up the phone when Michel calls), a clear example of Liberty. And with all three principles established, Kieslowski nicely connects all of the characters as well, in the final and most heartfelt scene.Red is about where you could have been if you were older or younger. It is about whether or not there is someone completely perfect for everyone, and whether or not one person can change your life. The final chapter in the most awe-inspiring trilogy ever made, this film breaks barriers in both directing and storytelling. It is not only about our modern life, but about where life could and should be in our modern time. And although the movie is more subtle than both Blue and White, it boldly exclaims a statement of love and compassion.It's hard to imagine that Red was Kieslowski's last film, and that he died at such a young age. Nevertheless, the trilogy will always be his masterpiece and we will always remember him for his work that ranks right up with Bergman, Fellini, and Wenders as a truly remarkable director who's never been awarded with an Oscar.

And with all three principles established, Kieslowski nicely connects all of the characters as well, in the final and most heartfelt scene.Red is about where you could have been if you were older or younger. It is about whether or not there is someone completely perfect for everyone, and whether or not one person can change your life. The final chapter in the most awe-inspiring trilogy ever made, this film breaks barriers in both directing and storytelling. It is not only about our modern life, but about where life could and should be in our modern time. And although the movie is more subtle than both Blue and White, it boldly exclaims a statement of love and compassion.It's hard to imagine that Red was Kieslowski's last film, and that he died at such a young age. Nevertheless, the trilogy will always be his masterpiece and we will always remember him for his work that ranks right up with Bergman, Fellini, and Wenders as a truly remarkable director who's never been awarded with an Oscar. Kieslowski, you have been missed!

I don't have anything else to say but it was just really bad and really lame and I hate Lili Taylor in that movie because when she screams it sounds totally fake and when she tries to look scared it's just weird. I have to fit ten lines in this so i'll just keep criticizing the movie. But really, if you think you want to see this movie, really really don't because its a complete waste of your time. Unless you want to laugh because it is sometimes very funny how unscary it is. And also, it had a pretty lame ending that didn't make much sense to me. I'm sure in the book it made a lot more sense so I feel bad for the author of the book since it was made into a complete joke of a movie. Sorry guys. It was bad.

Even with the support from the ever versatile Gene Hackman the movie was a box office flop! It's important to state from the outset that the film itself is pretty good and deserved better than it got, not just from the standard of movies that were around but also because it was well acted and raised some very important moral and medical questions that to some extent are more relative today with the controversy over stem cells than it was ten years ago! As for why the movie bombed I cant really say, perhaps not enough guns, sex and violence or maybe the theme or scenario was very depressing to many people. Also I think that being a thriller, actor George Cloony who was a lead in the popular medical soap ER would have been a better box office draw than Grant. Clooney who was struggling to break into the A&#150; list of movie stars at the time would have been believable as a doctor and the movie it self would have elevated him faster up to stardom than the duffers he did at around that time! However, it has to be said this is only as far as being a better box office draw, Cloony of course being American. It has to be said Hugh Grant was very good in this part and I think it was one of his best films. Grant was and still is better known for comedy or a romantic lead not a tough guy roles or action films, so perhaps this is why many in his fan base did not take to his character because it was a thriller not a comedy.Having said that he was very well cast for the part and on many occasions was able to display his dead pan dry wit and came across quite believable as the out of towner Dr. from the UK who didn't know what he was getting into. His character was typical Grant in the USA not aloof and pompous, but just a little awkward, slightly eccentric maybe and disorganized! I think that coming from England only made the character come across as more vulnerable and isolated as events unraveled and things seemed to conspire against him. When the well respected Dr. Myrick (Gene Hackman) decided that Dr. Luthan's (Hugh Grant) meddling was proving to be problematic as well as inconvenient, Luthan's feeling of paranoia towards his colleagues was more believable. No tough guy or macho part was needed here!Grant played Guy Luthan who was deemed for great things in the medical profession is a physician who encounters a distraught and frightened patient who had been found wandering the streets. He is extremely agitated, suffering convulsions and has strange legations at the base of his spine. Despite desperate attempts to save his life the mysterious patent dies. Luthan who is shocked over what he has witnessed is puzzled by a silver bracelet on the wrist which indicates that the patient (Claude Minkins) was probably a hospital patient somewhere and starts to make inquires. He orders blood work and lab analysis despite the fact that patient has no medical insurance (much to the annoyance of his superiors). When he can not find the hospital that used silver a bracelet and is concerned about the bizzar results in the lab report, he then delves further into this case much to the disdain of colleges and top faculty administrators. It appears that the patient was homeless and his medical records wiped and put in storage where he is unable to track them.Then the body mysteriously disappears, the chief residence is very nonchalant about it and berates and scolds Luthan in very dismissive and casual manner over his concern, this only leads him to become more suspicious. Soon he feels that he can't trust anybody as it appears that some are trying to thwart his own investigations. He is correct, ------ some within the hospital as well as outside are trying to frustrate his efforts in unraveling this mystery. Rather than back off, he let's his curiosity get the better off him, puts his professional reputation on the line which only results in disastrous consequences for him personally. Realizing that he is really on to something and now with nothing to lose he becomes even more determined to track down who is responsible for trying to ruin him, ------ but more importantly why?This movie raises medical and moral issues over the balance of patient care and medical advancement. This is not a new topic, the earlier movie COMA and many or medial shows since have dabbled with this dilemma but the ending in this movie leaves that question strangely unanswered? (Interestingly, at the beginning of the movie Luthan has an ethical dilemma of his own. While working in the ER he has to decide who gets the priority for the only OR room available at the time. It's a choice between a wounded Cop and the and the 'perp' who shot him, who incidentally is in a more serious condition. He decides that the cop should get priority)!Hugh Grant was good, so was Hackman and fine support from Sara Jessica -Parker, David Morse and Paul Guilfoyle. I would highly recommend this movie!
