I am somewhere in the middle of these two Coen proponents\/opponents.  I admire the Coen's immensely for their ability to create films that are just about as original as anything you will ever see. I thought O BROTHER WHERE ART THOUGH was one of the best films of last year and I certainly believe that FARGO was easily the better picture in 1996 ( losing out to best picture winner THE ENGLISH PATIENT).  THE BIG LEBOWSKI was also an ingenious film and in it Jeff Bridges turned in perhaps his most intriguing and puissant performance.  I loved all of these films.  Having said that, they have had their share of disappointments, THE HUDSUCKER PROXY and MILLERS CROSSING come to mind.  Still, the Coen's remain one of the best film makers working today.For reasons that are not quite clear to me, THE MAN WHO WASN'T THERE is more of a disappointment than I would like to admit.  I am a stalwart believer that many of their films require a second viewing to appreciate what they are trying to say.  I adhered to that theory with O Brother and Fargo and especially Lebowski.  So perhaps in the years to come I may buy the DVD and watch it a few more times and pick up things that perhaps I did not or could not see the first two times I watched this film.  I hope that is the case because I feel this is a decent film, but it is just missing something that many of their other films aren't.  I enjoyed the film to a point, especially the performances of Billy Bob Thorton and Tony Shaloub but when I left the theater, I did so feeling a little cheated, being that it was a Coen film.Thorton plays Ed Crane, a quiet, saturnine barber that just seems to exist. He doesn't seem particularly sanguine but at the same time, he doesn't seem overly sad.  He just seems like a man that is in the middle of his life and has accepted the fact that things are about as good as they are going to get.  He plays Bingo with his wife, he goes to work every day, he comes home every night and has dinner at the same time and he doesn't complain.  Life is life.  C'est la vie.  His wife, Doris Crane, on the other hand, seems a little more eccentric.  She works in a department store and she seems a trite enamoured with her boss, Big Dave.  She is played with duplicitous undertones beautifully by Coen veteran, Frances McDormand and her boss is portrayed by James Gandolfini as a proud man that thinks he is a little too successful.  He flirts clandestinely, so he believes, with Doris and she eats it up.  Many times they seem to be displaying their affections towards one another while Ed is in the next room or right across the dinner table. And perhaps they do this because many times it is hard to see if Ed has a pulse, let alone if he is paying any attention to what is happening in front of him.During the film a murder takes place, a lawyer is called in and all the while the proceedings get stranger and stranger, and seeing as this is a Coen film, that only stands to reason.  Doris goes to prison for the murder of her boss and Ed Crane has to hire Freddy Riedenschneider, the best but slimiest attorney around.  Think of Don King and any one of O.J's team of magicians working for him and you have Riedenschneider.Tony Shaloub, who I think is one of the most underrated actors out there, nails this performance to the letter.  He is a scurrilous, slimy snake that is at the apex of his profession but he affords himself all the luxuries his clients will give him.  What is perfect about this character is that we have seen characters like him in many films before, the difference is that these characters usually present the facade to their clients that they genuinely care about them.  They are written to come off as people that want to win because they care about them and that they are really just good people caught in a bad situation.  But not Freddy.  Freddy lets you know how brilliant he is, then shows you how brilliant he is and then just when you are impressed by his swagger and grasp of what is happening, he will hit you with a bill for every single expense he has incurred.  Not just for his legal team and his time, but for his seven course meal three times a day and his swanky accomodations in the town's five star hotel.  He gives this to you not with a sugar coated smile or a confident wink, but with the attitude that says, Hey this is business.  You know it and I know it.The plot gets all convoluted along the way and all the while I was interested but not really rivetted.  I was intrigued but not overwhelmed. And maybe that is due more to the fact that this is a Coen Brother's film and I have grown to expect more, much more.  To me the biggest problem with this film is that it just exists.  There is really nothing wrong with it but there is nothing that stands out.  I don't mean to perpetually offer comparisons, but unfortunately it is inevitable, and when I think of O Brother... and Fargo and Lebowski, I think of small characters from each film that stay with me.  Characters like the guy shovelling snow who has to give a description of Steve Buscemi in Fargo.  I think of Pete's cousin in O Brother, or I even think of George Clooney from the same movie.  In Lebowski you have Buscemi as Donny, who is probably the smartest guy in the film yet is constantly being told to shut up.  Then you have the Nihilists, all with personalities, all which stayed with me well after the film was through. The Man Who Wasn't There can't give me the same satisfaction.  It is a film that prods along and doesn't waste your time for two hours but it doesn't do much to enhance it.  And that is to bad because the Coen's can usually be counted on for that.6.5 out of 10.....

After I found out that this great 'method'-actor was going to play the role of the cool cop in an action-picture, I was convinced that this particular movie was going to be well worth-watching.  How wrong I was!                    *****SPOILER*****15 minutes isn't a bad movie, but it's so disorganized that it ruins the whole picture.  Actually, it consists of two parts. The first part WITH Robert De Niro is good.  You have two criminals who learn how the American media circus can make a remorseless killer look like the victim and make them rich.  On the other side, you'll find the good guys.  There's De Niro's character; a cool homicide detective who's eventually assisted by a fire marshall; played by Edward Burns.  Despite some poor acting, I really loved this 'cat-and-mouse-game' between the good guys and the bad guys.  But halfway the movie, director John Herzfeld makes an awful decision that will ruin the entire picture.  Totally without any warning whatsoever Robert De Niro's character is killed!Therefore the second part WITHOUT Robert De Niro is boring.  I don't mind the killing of an interesting character played by a famous actor (e.g. Sean Connery's character in The untouchables), but the way it was done here is simply too disturbing.  It's like taking the wheels from under a car.  Everything seems to be falling apart and no one really seems to know where to go from here.  The amateurish MTV-camerawork of the first part that reminded me constantly of 'Big Brother', appears to be even more annoying in the second part.  Altogether the only one to blame here is the director who has also written the story.  At first, Robert De Niro is good as always and Edward Burns isn't bad.  But unfortunately, once the main and most interesting character in this movie is brutally killed (by the director; not by the two criminals!) I was left empty-handed.  It seemed as if everyone was relying on De Niro in part 1.Anyhow, the film has had its shameful 15 minutes of fame!

Absolutely nothing happens in the film for the first 100 minutes - rather, things DO happen but not so you'd know.  It's always difficult to adapt a sprawling novel to a film with limited runtime, but, to me, Spielberg glosses over some very important issues near the beginning he could have expanded these (such as the father's influence on the two girls), and left out some fairly trivial scenes through the middle and towards the end.  Again, I'm not sure how the book finished, but to climax in such a contrived happy ending is almost demeaning to the audience, who should have been sitting there for well over two hours absolutely engrossed in the on-screen drama.

This is exactly why I hated A Walk to Remember.  For the first half hour to 45 minutes of this movie, it was somewhat enjoyable and entertaining.  Then, there was a turning point in the movie.  It became nauseatingly predictable.At first, I was only able to predict the ending vaguely, but as the time went on, I was able to pinpoint every detail of what was to happen next. A few times, I was even able to tell, word for word, what a character would say next.

Apparently directors read them too.Edmund Dantes is a simple man with simple desires, whose only goal in life is to save enough money so that he can wed his beautiful fiancee.

Convicted of nonexistent crimes, Edmund is sent to die in a hideous hellhole that masquerades as a prison.  Bereft of hope, and having denounced god, there is only one thing that keeps Edmund alive -dreams of escape and revenge.

The Count of Monte Cristo is a film with something for everyone romance, betrayal, intrigue, humor, sword fights&#133;  It embodies the spirit seen in the Indiana Jones trilogy - present the viewer with pure entertainment, and don't insult them. James Cavaziel's past performances have been less than stellar. More importantly, they have failed to demonstrate his dramatic range.  As Edmund, he is given the opportunity to create a character who undergoes stark changes, both physically and mentally Edmund metamorphoses from a shockingly naïve, young man, to bitter, bedraggled wretch with a tenuous grasp on reality, and finally into a scheming Machiavellian rake.  The transformation is both smooth and believable.  Edmund's friend\/foil is Fernand, played with aplomb by Guy Pearce.  Pearce is so despicably roguish, that you almost admire his as you're loathing him.  Richard Harris is wonderful as Faria, Edmund's grizzled sage advisor, confessor and trainer.  The rest of the supporting cast also accord themselves well.The film succeeds largely because it does not take itself seriously - even the most dramatic scenes are played with tongue planted in cheek and it is obvious that the cast were caught up in this spirit.

It's a thriller, where Morgan Freeman brings back the role of detective\/profiler\/mind-reader Alex Cross, who you may remember from Kiss the Girls.  It's based on the novel by Patterson, which I haven't read, about the kidnapping of a senator's daughter.  It was OK, but it could have been so much better in the hands of a great screenwriter.  Instead, it feels like Hollywood mailed this one in once Freeman signed on.The movie reminded me of the movies they show on the Lifetime network.  I watched this movie with my wife and she loved it as much as she loves the Lifetime marathons on Sunday.  The problem with Lifetime movies, and ACAS, is that they all treat the audience members like total idiots.  Important knowledge about the story is handed to the main characters, characters know or remember things that you wouldn't expect, etc.  Instead of creating an interesting way to get from A to B, we go straight out the A door and into the B door, as if the only reason the story even happens is so that we get caught by the plot twist at the end.  It's not suspenseful, and the only reason we get caught by surprise at all is because we've been lulled to sleep.  Thankfully, the movie ends quickly as soon as the pony shows his one trick.Along Came A Spider also contains my pet peeve, which is that it abuses technology to advance the plot.  The victims this time are once again computers and the internet, which the script abuses throughout the film - including the now classic I could explain the whole movie if I only knew this computer's password!

Sure, it doesn't have as much intelligence as MST3K, or as much witty dialogue as a Kevin Smith movie, but Kung Pow resonates with tear jerking insanity.Taking and old kung-fu movie, re-editing and re-dubbing it, Steve Odekerk (Ace Ventura When Nature Calls, Thumb Wars) creates a light hearted, well meaning, silly film.The plot (if you want to know) concerns The Chosen One, played by Odekerk himself.  Born with the mark of the Chosen One (his tongue), Chosen's family is killed when he is a baby by the evil Master Pain (a.k.a. Betty). However, when Pain attempts to kill the newborn, Chosen jumps out of his cradle and unleashes major CGI assisted butt.After escaping Pain and being raised by rodents in the wild, Chosen continues to run into random people who want to kill him.  So, he goes to a Temple to learn how to defeat Pain.  He meets and falls in love with local babe Ling, gets annoyed by Wind-Blows and his dubbed squeaky shoes, and endured the oddities of the dubbing of his trainer (Taco Bell, Taco Bell, product placement for Taco Bell!)Chosen goes on to fight Pain, evil henchmen, a CGI cow (in my opinion, the movie's one slow spot, what with an outdated, but silly, Matrix parody), and other weirdness.The filmmakers were smart enough to know how far silliness can be taken. After starting off with some funny dubbed voices, they keep the voices, but add on to them, with funny dialogue (not K. Smith quality though), weird characters, and other things that just wring humor out of every possible aspect (The Ventriloquists, Ling and her weird noised, Wind-Blows and his squeaky shoes).  The filmmakers even use bad editing as a joke!Another good thing about Kung Pow was it's good hearted nature.  It is never vulgar or obscene, or use gross-out jokes as a crutch like many other comedies, and is not trying to be mean to its audience or the films it parodies.  The filmmakers obviously have a love for kung-fu and action movies, and it shows through this good natured parody.  While not really appropriate for younger kids, this film is great and not very offensive.And for anyone who says this movie is offensive intellectually, remember another movie with just as much silliness called Monty Python and the Holy Grail?  This movie is silliness on a grand scale.   And I laughed almost as hard during this movie as I did in Holy Grail.So if you're one of those people who hate a movie for just trying to entertain and be silly, laugh at your own seriousness and lack of lust for the idiocies and of life.  I agree that stupidy can reach annoyance (see Fast and the Furious), but for me, it sure didn't happen here. So c'mon and laugh!  Or better yet, go watch How High, and realize just how mean spirited, talentless, and unfunny a comedy can be.But for anyone who loves Monty Python, Ace Ventura, MST3K's sillier moments, and Kevin Smith's works (especially the Clerks Cartoon in the case of a movie like this), Kung Pow Enter the Fist is for you.

I agree that stupidy can reach annoyance (see Fast and the Furious), but for me, it sure didn't happen here. So c'mon and laugh!  Or better yet, go watch How High, and realize just how mean spirited, talentless, and unfunny a comedy can be.But for anyone who loves Monty Python, Ace Ventura, MST3K's sillier moments, and Kevin Smith's works (especially the Clerks Cartoon in the case of a movie like this), Kung Pow Enter the Fist is for you.  ","genre":"Action, Comedy"},{"date":"27 January 2002","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  *Slight Spoilers of Great Jokes and Minor Plot Points Ahead*With silliness that lasts from beginning to end, and a streamline of hilarity that sent me gasping for air and drying my eyes every five seconds literally, Kung Pow Enter the Fist is the dumbest, and funniest movie I've seen in a while.  Sure, it doesn't have as much intelligence as MST3K, or as much witty dialogue as a Kevin Smith movie, but Kung Pow resonates with tear jerking insanity.Taking and old kung-fu movie, re-editing and re-dubbing it, Steve Odekerk (Ace Ventura When Nature Calls, Thumb Wars) creates a light hearted, well meaning, silly film.The plot (if you want to know) concerns The Chosen One, played by Odekerk himself.  Born with the mark of the Chosen One (his tongue), Chosen's family is killed when he is a baby by the evil Master Pain (a.k.a. Betty). However, when Pain attempts to kill the newborn, Chosen jumps out of his cradle and unleashes major CGI assisted butt.After escaping Pain and being raised by rodents in the wild, Chosen continues to run into random people who want to kill him.  So, he goes to a Temple to learn how to defeat Pain.  He meets and falls in love with local babe Ling, gets annoyed by Wind-Blows and his dubbed squeaky shoes, and endured the oddities of the dubbing of his trainer (Taco Bell, Taco Bell, product placement for Taco Bell!)Chosen goes on to fight Pain, evil henchmen, a CGI cow (in my opinion, the movie's one slow spot, what with an outdated, but silly, Matrix parody), and other weirdness.The filmmakers were smart enough to know how far silliness can be taken. After starting off with some funny dubbed voices, they keep the voices, but add on to them, with funny dialogue (not K. Smith quality though), weird characters, and other things that just wring humor out of every possible aspect (The Ventriloquists, Ling and her weird noised, Wind-Blows and his squeaky shoes).  The filmmakers even use bad editing as a joke!Another good thing about Kung Pow was it's good hearted nature.  It is never vulgar or obscene, or use gross-out jokes as a crutch like many other comedies, and is not trying to be mean to its audience or the films it parodies.  The filmmakers obviously have a love for kung-fu and action movies, and it shows through this good natured parody.  While not really appropriate for younger kids, this film is great and not very offensive.And for anyone who says this movie is offensive intellectually, remember another movie with just as much silliness called Monty Python and the Holy Grail?  This movie is silliness on a grand scale.   And I laughed almost as hard during this movie as I did in Holy Grail.So if you're one of those people who hate a movie for just trying to entertain and be silly, laugh at your own seriousness and lack of lust for the idiocies and of life.

Why was the hotel haunted or why did Jack Nicholson go crazy in The shining and why is Tom Cruise being threatened after having visited a secret, sexual group?

OK, so it isn't jam-packed with crude\/sexual sight gags, but it does open with a lot of gags that are silly and idiotic.  Even the ones that made me laugh also made me think, That's pitiful.  For example, there's one gag where the girlfriend (Schuyler Fisk) blackmails the head cheerleader (who has connections to people in Stanford) into helping get her boyfriend (Colin Hanks) into Stanford.  First she threatens to mention the time she made out with a geeky boy at a Halloween party.  Then the time she made out with two guys at her former boyfriend's funeral.  To top if off, she mentions the night at the Prom when she threw up in the bathroom and made out with the butch-looking security guard.  And yes, they showed it.  I laughed--while cringing a little--but I couldn't help but think to myself, That's going too far.  And I swear to God, the next director who includes a dog-humps-leg gag is going to be shot!  And I have to feel sorry for the people of (the real) Orange County.  I've never been there, but I'm pretty sure not every resident is either a stoner, a surfer or a ditz.  Obviously, Jake Kasdan didn't do much research.  And your Dad directed Raiders of the Lost Ark?  Just kidding. What I do have to admire is that it's one of the few comedies that gets better as it goes along, rather than starting with tons of laughs and sagging towards the end.  And--this is one quality that almost NO other teen comedy has--the adult characters are well-developed!  Many directors tend to overlook the grown-ups in these movies, and choose to portray them as either overprotective grumps or bumbling idiots.  The adult characters are flawed, but not in an over-the-top fashion.  However, I thought the subplot involving the Mom (Catherine O'Hara) marrying an old, handicapped man was forced.  I know a lot of women like older men, but that's pertaining to guys like Sean Connery or men with a lot of money (like Anna-Nicole Smith's former husband).  I don't see what she found in him.  But the Dad (John Lithgow) falling for a floozie half his age (Leslie Mann) should strike true to a lot of children of divorced parents.  There's a scene where Mom and Dad talk about how much they hate their lives and their current mates, and eventually end up hooking up again.  Most directors would've probably cut that scene out, wanting to focus solely on the characters under 18, but not in this case.  Good job, Jake!The veteran adult actors contribute greatly to the cast.  Lithgow is the funniest of the lot, and has the funniest line  Why do you wanna become a writer?  You're not oppressed; you're not gay!  O'Hara is also a hoot, and steals a few scenes.  Other great talents include Lily Tomlin, Chevy Chase, Harold Ramis, Garry Marshall and Kevin Kline.  There's one surprise cameo, which I will leave a surprise.  Hint  Just like the two main stars, this person's also a second-generation actor.  Yep, this film is filled with second-generation talent--behind and in front of the camera.  The director is Jake Kasdan, son of Lawrence Kasdan.  Colin Hanks is the son of Tom Hanks.  Schuyler Fisk is the daughter of Sissy Spacek.  I criticized Hanks for his last two lame-o flicks  Whatever It Takes and Get Over It.  Well, this time he actually has a good character to work with--not playing the school geek--and this is one film that will probably make his Dad somewhat proud.  Schuyler Fisk is another very talented actress, who carries her Mom's name well (Well, technically not her name, but you know what I mean).  Both Hanks and Fisk have promising careers ahead of them.  And they make a cute couple in this film.  Hanks is a good-looking boy and Fisk is a pretty girl, but they don't look like models pulled off the cover of Seventeen.  Jack Black has a couple funny scenes, but this is the one film where he actually doesn't upstage everyone.  Usually, Black is like the life of the party--he brings out the bulk of the laughs in almost every film he's been in.  But I do have to say, I was cracking up soooo loud when Black started walking around in his undies.   I wouldn't quite recommend this film, but I admire it for what it is.

I didn't understand the heightened world of glam, the sexuality, and the people in this movie. But then I saw it a few days ago for a second time, and this is a truly beautiful movie. The story begins when Oscar Wilde is left on a doorstep of a house, with a green jewel pinned to his blanket. He introduces the sexual revolution to the world. But it still remains quiet. The jewel is passed to one generation to the next. Then Jack Fairy inherits the jewel, gets beat up in the school yard, but smiles as the blood on his lips looks like lipstick. He can't wait to take over the world. Flash ahead to the early seventies, where the revolution is in full swing. The head of it all is Brian Slade with Curt Wilde and Jack Fairy as his supporters, but Brian lets it all go with a fake assassination. Ten years later, the revolution is forgotten. The color and wonder is gone. Arthur Stuart, a reporter, is asked to do a story about Brian Slade and where he went after the fake assassination. Through interviews of people, Arthur not only goes back to the past of Brian Slade, but to his own past. Arthur tried to forget his past, but realizes he should have embraced it. Jonathan Rhys Meyers was excellently cast as Brian Slade, an ego-maniac, yet beautiful and mysterious pop star. He's just so wonderful to look at and he can reflect so much feeling in his face. But his character, I believe, is the most despicable. Ewan McGregor is also excellent as the kind of hilarious and over-the-top Curt Wilde. I think that Curt Wilde is one of the more tragic characters of the movie. Heroin was his main man, but once he was off it, Brian was his main man, but Brian's ego became too huge leaving Curt scarred. There was a love between them, but the commercial side of Brian destroyed it from ever becoming more than just a publicity stunt. Curt is the only character that ever stayed true to himself in the end. Toni Collette's Mandy Slade is also another great character. She is Brian's American wife who puts an act on as a London hipster. She's all glammed up until Brian's ego and drug addiction snaps her back to reality, and the walls she had built up are torn down and she feels hurt like Curt. And then Christian Bale's Arthur Stuart is like the icing on the cake. His is the character that goes through the biggest change. He's a wide-eyed innocent teenager who embraces glam rock and loves it because it speaks to him. He leaves his oppressive world and lives it up in London and loves it all. But the scene dies, and so does the person Arthur was. When he looks back into his past, he finds himself again, but he doesn't don make up or glitter, he wears a smile on his face and holds those moments to his heart. (Spoiler) Which is why the jewel is passed on to him in the end. He embraces the past and remembers the glory, and carries on the torch of it in his heart. That is the true revolution. Finding yourself and loving yourself. And I felt that there was a story to this movie. That the stylish images had more meaning than just stylish images. And I love it. It's great. I think its a wonderful celebration of glam rock and the world that was moving around it. 9\/10If you like this movie I suggest The Rocky Horror Picture Show and Hedwig and the Angry Inch. Rocky because I think it is also a celebration of glam rock and a nice last hurrah of that era, and Hedwig because it is about finding yourself beneath the glitz and glamour.

But his character, I believe, is the most despicable. Ewan McGregor is also excellent as the kind of hilarious and over-the-top Curt Wilde. I think that Curt Wilde is one of the more tragic characters of the movie. Heroin was his main man, but once he was off it, Brian was his main man, but Brian's ego became too huge leaving Curt scarred. There was a love between them, but the commercial side of Brian destroyed it from ever becoming more than just a publicity stunt. Curt is the only character that ever stayed true to himself in the end. Toni Collette's Mandy Slade is also another great character. She is Brian's American wife who puts an act on as a London hipster. She's all glammed up until Brian's ego and drug addiction snaps her back to reality, and the walls she had built up are torn down and she feels hurt like Curt. And then Christian Bale's Arthur Stuart is like the icing on the cake. His is the character that goes through the biggest change. He's a wide-eyed innocent teenager who embraces glam rock and loves it because it speaks to him. He leaves his oppressive world and lives it up in London and loves it all. But the scene dies, and so does the person Arthur was. When he looks back into his past, he finds himself again, but he doesn't don make up or glitter, he wears a smile on his face and holds those moments to his heart. (Spoiler) Which is why the jewel is passed on to him in the end. He embraces the past and remembers the glory, and carries on the torch of it in his heart. That is the true revolution. Finding yourself and loving yourself. And I felt that there was a story to this movie. That the stylish images had more meaning than just stylish images. And I love it. It's great. I think its a wonderful celebration of glam rock and the world that was moving around it. 9\/10If you like this movie I suggest The Rocky Horror Picture Show and Hedwig and the Angry Inch. Rocky because I think it is also a celebration of glam rock and a nice last hurrah of that era, and Hedwig because it is about finding yourself beneath the glitz and glamour.

The acting is pretty good especially from Jet Li and Tchéky Karyo, who plays corrupt French police officer Richard. He is probably the best character in Kiss of the Dragon and ***SPOILER*** has the bloodiest death in the whole movie. Bridget Fonda is good also.The fights. The fight sequences in Kiss of the Dragon are very well executed and choreographed. Probably the one fight I will remember would probably be the fight between Jet Li and the two blonde-haired henchmen, played by French actors Cyril Raffaelli and Didier Azoulay. It really is nice to see two non-Asian people who are able match wits with Jet Li in a fight. I mean for a second there, I actually thought that Jet Li was doomed to these two guys. I really wish these two were more developed in this movie.Let's face the facts Jet Li has proved that he is quite the martial arts star. He is already at the top of his game and with Lethal Weapon 4, Romeo Must Die, and the much recent The One under his belt, he is doing pretty fine for himself. I can already see that probably not even five years from now, he will probably star in a really good movie, up there with the likes of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. Finally, one thing that really seems to get at me is that some people believe that Jet Li is the new Bruce Lee. Hardly. Myself and anyone else who reads this knows that this is not true. I like Jet Li. I believe that he can act and kick serious a** in his films but to say that he is the next Bruce Lee is just wrong.Kiss of the Dragon gets a 9\/10.

This second entry in the series isn't for everyone but it's well crafted and deserves a better reputation than the one it has.In a clever plot twist, the film takes place directly after the first one, with masked lunatic Michael Meyers surviving his supposedly fatal fall from a balcony and stealing a new knife from a neighbor lady. Laurie Strode is taken to the nearby hospital while Dr. Loomis resumes his search for the escaped psycho. After killing a couple pointless characters Mike finally sets his targets on Laurie and sneaks into the almost abandoned hospital, searching room-for-room for his next victim-to-be. HALLOWEEN II is a mixed bag. On one hand, director Rick Rosenthal nicely captures the atmosphere of the original and delivers some genuine shocks, but for the most part this plays more like your average FRIDAY THE 13TH clone, complete with gory murders, sleazy sex and shamefully underdeveloped characters. The best example of this is Laurie. In the original the film was basically about her and the problems that she faced, not just with Michael, but with her friends and herself. Here she is just as expendable as the other characters. Not only does she not reappear until thirty minutes into the movie, but when she finally is reintroduced, all she does is sleep and wander aimlessly through the halls! In fact, by now I could really consider Michael the main character of this movie! The first half is basically made up of him sneaking through houses and around the town before the film finally shifts gears and focuses on the victims-to-be.That said and done, once HALLOWEEN II gets going it IS kinda' scary. The film's best moments come during the scenes of subtle suspense and terror, not the ultra-gory killings. The scenes of Michael roaming through the empty corridors of the hospital, while Laurie sits hopelessly in her room waiting for the final confrontation, are very tense and if the entire movie could've had that same effect it could of been a classic. Another memorable moment is when Michael chases the helpless Laurie through the hospital in the now-familiar, but this time rather unsettling, climatic showdown.So all in all I can't really give HALLOWEEN II my basic star rating. As a slasher film all in itself it's fairly good, but as a sequel to one of the greatest horror movies ever made, well . . . This is not the best sequel but it is the scariest, and I whole-heartedly recommend this to any die-hard slasher or HALLOWEEN fanatics.
