I know the film makers were not making this movie for the sake of pretty actors prancing around in a bogus movie. I know for a fact that Michael Bay set out to make a great film. He dropped out of this movie twice before getting what he wanted. While this movie is also around to bring in money, it was also meant to be good. Michael Bay was at his best in the director's chair. The visuals were fantastic. The cinematography was comparable to SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, where bright colors are not so apparent. The dialog was not cheesy. Even though some story-telling elements are basic, it's all worded differently by the actors who do a great job. Ben Affleck is one of my new favorite actors. Over the years he's matured as a real serious actor. Josh Hartnet has still got it too. Kate Beckinsale did a nice job too, and it's hard to believe that she was difficult to work with in this movie. Even though it was a small role, it was nice to see Dan Aykroyd. (Did I spell it right?) He had something of a serious presentation with the few lines he had, and made his extended cameo more noticable than it normally would be. Alec Baldwin was also a good touch to the movie. I only wish to see him more as a leading man than a suporting man. The special effects looked very real. I could not tell what was computer animation and what was real. This was especially effective during the big moment of the movie. The seemingly 40 minute battle sequence at Pearl Harbor was one of the most intense sequences in any movie. This scene alone is worth the whole movie. It has been a long time since I held tightly to the seat, pushed against the cushions, and had to catch my breath when the scene was over. Plus it wasn't glorified to a stupid level. The sequence didn't make it look like the Americans won. But it did show how they were able to take a stand as best they could during the horrible battle. They at least lost while giving the Japanese everything they got. Another great touch was how old WWII footage would be shown, and how the movie was filmed within it. And how it would fade from old film to new film in between scenes. This movie was critically panned simply because people got their hopes up WAY too high. A movie shouldn't fail because of this. It seems like people would like movies better if they weren't so ready for the best thing in the world. PEARL HARBOR isn't the best, but it's one of the best of 2001.

Kind, sweet, lovely Maria (Brigette Helm) stops them saying they should talk through their differences.  However the evil head of the city wants a revolt so he can get rid of them and put in robot workers.  He gets a mad scientist to help him.  He kidnaps Maria and (in a stunning sequence) transforms the robot into her image.  However this Maria is pure evil and sets the workers off...and things go barreling out of control.The original version of this was (purportedly) 5 hours long!  It has been cut drastically over the years and much footage was lost.  Finally, 75 years later, we have a version that is complete as possible (it runs a little over 2 hours), looks incredible and has a great reconstruction of the 1927 score.The film still holds up--the special effects are still impressive and quite obviously influenced many sci-fi films of the future (Blade Runner especially).  The movie moves quickly and there is (literally) a cast of hundreds.  Great sets, special effects, a beautiful music score...a definite must-see.  Only debit--the acting.  It's VERY overdone especially by Helms.  She's OK as the sweet Maria but is hopeless doing evil Maria.  The audience I saw it with broke out laughing more than a few times at the expressions on her face.  Also the actors must have been freezing doing this--you can see their breath!Also, there's a 1984 reconstruction which cut the film to 80 minutes, added tinting and (briefly) a color sequence and put in a rock score (including Loverboy, Pat Benatar, Lyle Lovett etc etc).  Sounds horrible but it works.  It just doesn't make a lot of sense (40 minutes were edited out!).  That's worth seeing, but see this one first.  Again--a must-see!

I had no big problems with the black and white color scheme, especially when I found out how small a budget this film had.  Which brings me to my next point.  Clerks was made for just under $27,000, an unheard of budget in todays world of overbudgeted, untalented so called epics (Fellowship of the Ring excluded, I love that movie.)  Smith made that money work.  The talent he got to play the main characters Dante (Brian O'Halloran) and Randal (Jeff Anderson) were perfectly casted.  There are moments in the movie when the acting seems a bit forced, like they are reading their lines, but for basically rookie actors tackling major roles, they do just fine and those moments of forced acting are few and far between.

Watching some of the scenes gave the idea that movie TRIED to be serious, when it didn't work out like that in any of the attempts.BUT, towards the end of the film, with the chase through the mall, and through the mine underneath the city, it became more and more interesting in a B-film-mid-20th-century-kind-of-way!!Other people here who have given their comments to this film has brought up Mars Attacks and Arachnophobia - I would say Gremlins instead - especially the sound effects and the spiders-knocking-them-self-out-running-into-the-wall-scenes was a clear resemblance!!!

This movie is one of the best and also one of the last to come out in a great time for horror. Ever since Scream came out, it seems that most horror movies are more and more watered down so they can be marketed to a younger audience. This film was released a year before this disappointing trend arrived. Not only that, this is almost a forgotten gem and a link to the heyday of his career. Carpenter has always put out great work, but hasn't put anything out to rival his platinum era. I call the time between 1978-1984 the platinum era, seeing as each one of his films from the era or masterpieces. Not only are they masterpieces in their own right, but it seems like each film gets better in its own way. It started with the beginning of the franchise\/slasher era with Halloween. He followed up Halloween with the excellent ghost story that is The Fog. After The Fog he put out 4 more classics Escape from New York, with the antihero Snake Plissken; The Thing, a landmark in special effects which could be argued to be the best film of his career; Christine, which gets my vote for best Stephen King adaption and coolest car; and the touching Starman, a sci-fi love story. After this his work was still golden, but had more of a b-movie feel to it. This included the camp classic They Live and the anthology Body Bags. In the Mouth of Madness displays the brilliance shown in the platinum era. I don't want to spoil anything, but this is one of the better horror movies to come out in the past ten years. Of course, this didn't break any records at the box office. Not only did this come out in a time before horror became cool again, it was also a time when tickets were $5 for evening shows. Nevertheless, this movie is done well on all fronts. Carpenter knows how to make you jump out of your seat and presents some really unsettling visuals. I get a little more creeped out with each viewing. Sam Neill puts in a great performance, and Julie Carmen also does well in her supporting role. Another Carpenter score to perfectly compliment the movie. This movie is also shot very well, and boasts an excellent script. A must for all Carpenter fans and highly recommended to any fans new to the horror genre. Turn the lights down low and enjoy!

The relationship between the children was very real, teasing and loving by turns. Haley J Osment, look and learn !Kidman did a great job on the accent. I had the misfortune to watch Jodie Foster try her posh English accent out in Anna & The King the night before, and I can tell you now, being a great actress (as Jodie is) does not automatically endow one with the gift of tongues.A lot of things didn't sit right with me when first I saw this film. I couldn't work out the reason for the animosity between Kidman's character and her daughter Anne, and between Kidman and the sinister servants. This is why I say watch this film twice. Although the ending resolves all issues, there are so many subtle nuances in the interactions between the characters prior to this that are very easy to miss the first time around. And make so much sense on a second viewing.-SPOILERS (if you haven't seen this film yet - shame on you !)-I know there are people who have posted here who have said they worked out all the plot within five minutes. I find this hard to believe. I am a fairly intelligent person, I watch a lot of films, and I must say that I was taken in.I can't accept the verdict of other posters that this film was a rip-off of Sixth Sesne either. Yes, SS was a very good film too, but not nearly in the same league as Others. Sure, you have the same base ingredient - people who are unaware they are dead - but I would always have put SS into the same league as Ghost. The Others is much deeper, in that Kidmans character is an infanticide, and unaware of this horror; she plays the role perfectly, so protective of the children she herself killed. The sinister servants turn out to be helpers, subtly guiding her and the children to a realisation of their state; this latter strand put me in mind of the chiropodist\/angel from Jacobs Ladder.I could go on and on, but won't.I think that how one was brought up plays a great role in how one views a story like this. Some people go to see a horror film hoping to see CGI ghosts leaping from cellars. What these people are really after is gore, and would be much more satisfied with Russ Meyers' movies.What really got me about this film (and this is where the biased observer part comes in) is the memories I retain from my own childhood. When I was in my very early teens, my parents took me to stay in a house which was very similar to the one featured in this film. It was an old Manor House, in the grandest of Anglo-Irish traditions, with few guests, and few servants. One evening, I went to the top of the house, and found a small doorway just adjacent to what would, I think, have been the servant's quarters at the turn of the last Century. Going in, I found before me an attic corridor stretching ahead for some distance - this was a big house !  Being in the eaves, the roof was just above my head, and all was painted pure white. There were four rooms to the left, and four to the right. The place was clean, and tidy, but obviously hadn't been occupied for a long time. Each room was tiny, and painted white, and contained nothing but small mementoes of the past, untouched and unarranged; a doll's house in one room, a rocking horse in another etc. And in each tiny room, a cat, sometimes two or three, peering out from behind these artifacts. As a child,  these images were disturbing, but I couldn't for many years figure out why. It was only as I got older that I began to appreciate that the disquieting thing about these abandoned rooms was the lack of children, and, at the same time, the overwhelming sense that they were still there.The Others struck a big chord with me, not least because it stirred memories buried for a long time, but also because it is full of great scenes, is brilliantly characterised, and the performances throughout ring as true as they possibly could in a ghost story.But... watch it twice.....

Normally, this wouldn't have bothered me much, except for two things--first, as the other reviewer noted, the other characters make such a HUGE deal out of it, that it's laughable.  Every other comment they make to Roland, they insert some reference to his being American.  Second, the reason this change was made is that the director felt that audiences wouldn't understand British class snobbery, and thought nationality snobbery would play better.  Um, ok.  I guess LaBute thinks that an audience that would go to see a somewhat 'historical' costume drama about letters and literature is also stupid. Sure.While I understand that it's impossible to translate this *entire* lengthy, incredibly dense book to the screen, so much was cut out that I couldn't believe it.  Whole swaths of supporting characters are missing, and consequently their interconnecting subplots.  No Val, (though we have Fergus), no Beatrice Nest, no Leonora Stern, no a LOT of people.  Part of the incredible fun of the end of the novel is that all these subplots and characters converge in an astonishing and almost comical way---that was completely lost in the film.The most unforgivable omission, in my opinion, is that there is only the *barest* of references to Christabel's Melusina, and then, only as the 'fairy story'.  Um...isn't that what a large chunk of the book is about? Christabel and her work, which has parallels throughout the story, to Maud, to serpents, 'cold fish', changelings, the color green....and I could go on forever.  There are a small number of instances of green in the film--green dresses on Christabel, a slightly green scarf on Maud...but a viewer would probably never get the allusions without a) mentioning Melusina, and b) having read the book.There are a few scenes\/descriptive images taken directly from the book (for instance, the scene in the church in France, where Christabel holds her hands over her abdomen while her cousin Sabine gets a clue), but they are never explained---absolutely nothing is mentioned about how Christabel seems almost not to be aware of her circumstances.  This could have been easily avoided with the deft use of narration from the journals---but it was exceptionally poorly and lazily used instead.  (For an example of good narration, try Age of Innocence, or The Usual Suspects.  This ain't it.) This is only one instance of many where some point is presented or something is mentioned without most or all of the supporting information that helps it to make sense.Another nearly unforgivable change is the lack of attention to hair color. Maud is pale blonde, as she should be---but there's a REASON that she is, and it's more than because Fergus would annoy her about it!  I adore Jennifer Ehle, but her hair should also have been pale blond, as should May's have been.As a side note to the hair issue--in the novel, Maud's hair is not only pulled back, but completely *covered*.  It's an insight into her personality, for one thing.  In the film, it's only in a bun or loose ponytail--so when Roland asks her why her hair is always pulled back like that, it has very little impact.  Many people wear their hair back--it's a common thing to do.  The point is, wearing your hair in a turban in this day and age is NOT common, and thus deserves to be questioned, for it must have an unusual explanation.Before I completely rip the movie apart, here are a few good things.1) It is visually very nice.  Attention was paid to set detail and costuming at least in and of itself, if not its accuracy with the novel.2) The casting was relatively all right.  I'm not sure I'd have cast these precise people in these roles, but all of them are excellent actors in their own right, and none of them (especially Aaron Eckhart) are hard on the eyes. )3) The one scene that I feel the director got nearly perfectly right is the opening\/closing scene, with the daisy chain and lock of hair.  The look, colors, emotional feel--everything seemed accurate, and well done.  It's just too bad the whole endeavor couldn't have held to the same standard.The biggest problem with this film (other than the obvious non-sensical changes) is that it's far, far too short.  The director didn't even have the guts, apparently, to make it a full two hours.  Possession really needs to be at minimum a 2-part miniseries, preferably at least a 6-hour series in the tradition of A&E's Pride & Prejudice.Bottom line--not a faithful adaptation--I give it 2 of 4 stars.

The point is, wearing your hair in a turban in this day and age is NOT common, and thus deserves to be questioned, for it must have an unusual explanation.Before I completely rip the movie apart, here are a few good things.1) It is visually very nice.  Attention was paid to set detail and costuming at least in and of itself, if not its accuracy with the novel.2) The casting was relatively all right.  I'm not sure I'd have cast these precise people in these roles, but all of them are excellent actors in their own right, and none of them (especially Aaron Eckhart) are hard on the eyes. )3) The one scene that I feel the director got nearly perfectly right is the opening\/closing scene, with the daisy chain and lock of hair.  The look, colors, emotional feel--everything seemed accurate, and well done.  It's just too bad the whole endeavor couldn't have held to the same standard.The biggest problem with this film (other than the obvious non-sensical changes) is that it's far, far too short.  The director didn't even have the guts, apparently, to make it a full two hours.  Possession really needs to be at minimum a 2-part miniseries, preferably at least a 6-hour series in the tradition of A&E's Pride & Prejudice.Bottom line--not a faithful adaptation--I give it 2 of 4 stars.

The first time I saw it, I thought it was just a jumble of drug-induced fantasies made by some spoiled rich kids.  Now that I've seen it again after all those years of historical perspective, I now see that it was truly a work of genius.Possible Spoiler!It isn't just a social commentary on the bigotry and hypocricy of the 1960's toward the long hairs.  Underneath all the groovy, man hippie dialog and constant drug use, you can see the real purpose of the film  It is a simple but powerful statement of the futility of going down the wrong path in search of the American dream.It starts out with our two righteous heroes scoring some big cash by smuggling drugs out of Mexico.  Their dream is to go to Mardi Gras for a big party and then retire in Florida with their ill-gotten money.   In spite of their crime, they are portrayed as innocent and gentle young men in search of personal freedom.  In the course of their journey, they experience several different lifestyles, none of which truly satisfies them.  They spend time at a hippie commune; which they find to be full of weird people who, instead of being truly free, are struggling for their very survival.   They go on an lsd-enhanced romp with some prostitutes in a New Orleans cemetery, which turns out to be a real downer for them.  They get exposed to verbal abuse and even violence by the rednecks in several towns along the way.  They connect with a drunk, but very insightful, lawyer who is unsure of his own place in the world. When it seems that he will start making a difference in the lives of our heroes, he is brutally beaten to death by some rednecks from the town they had all stopped in earlier that day.The only positive experience they have is when they stop to fix a flat tire at the farm of a God-fearing man and his family in the rural southwest.  While sharing a meal with them, Peter Fonda's character compliments the man about how he has his life all together, even though they are generations apart in lifestyle.So why are our heroes going through all of this?  They are searching for their own version of the American Dream.  Although they may be motorcycle riding hippies of the counterculture of the 1960's, their goal was to make some quick money so that they could retire from the worries of life.  It is very symbolic that they kept their drug-earned money hidded in one bike's gasoline tank that is painted with an American flag.  Rather than conforming to the world of the time by getting haircuts and finding jobs, they pursue their dream by getting some quick money and seeking the freedom to enjoy themselves for the rest of their lives.  The dream is the same, the motives are the same, but the methods are different. At the end they realize that they are really no different from the culture they sought to escape from.  Peter Fonda's character sums it all up with the simple line, We blew it toward the end of the movie.   Shortly after that is the famous scene of them getting blown away with a shotgun by some ignorant rednecks in a pickup truck on some southern backcountry road.  They start their noble quest in secret with a drug deal, and their quest and very lives are ended in secret on an obscure country road.  But their terrible end doesn't happen they find out that the freedom they sought wasn't at all what they expected it would be.I think this film still has a strong message even today.  Many of the social ills of our culture have their roots in the misguided ideals of the 1960's counterculture.  Those who think they can become truly free by rejecting the hard-learned principles that served previous generations tend to find that life has a way of enslaving them in other ways.As to the film, the acting is simple, straightforward and powerful.  The dialog is very understated, and leaves a lot to the imagination.  The scenery is fantastic, and the music fits the story perfectly.   Those who weren't alive during the 1960's may not understand it, but it is still worth watching.  Highly recommended!

Yeah, I know.  Don't ask.  The cameos are very amusing, including one by Gene Simmonds as a Reverend preaching abstitence.  This is an obvious inside joke, being that Simmonds banged about 5,000 chicks back in his hayday. There are other hilarious cameos, including one at the end that will have you on the floor.  Eddie Griffin is delightfully amusing as Luther and says one of the funniest lines  Prison is a lot like high school  the sex you want, you don't get and the sex you get...you don't want.  Unfortunately, the fine actress Illeana Douglas is wasted in a thankless role.When the film surpasses the 30-minute mark, it becomes harmless and mildly entertaining.  The soundtrack is one of the best soundtracks I've heard in a while, including the great In the Air Tonight by Phil Collins, which some may remember from Risky Business in the Tom Cruise-Rebecca DeMornay love scene.  The minute that song played, I felt like I just received an adrenaline shot, especially after the film's lame first act.  The characters are all cardboard cut-outs and utterly cliched--with the exception of Qualls's geeky friends, who DON'T belong to the Chess Club and DON'T wear goofy clothing.  The minute you see the beautiful head cheerleader, Eliza Dushku, going out with the dumb, obnoxious jock--you know exactly how that's gonna turn out.  But the film's message is pure.  It's a message that has been expressed in several teen movies, but in The New Guy it actually played off well.  That message is not to snub anyone because they may not be as popular as you and may be much different from you.  I couldn't help but sympathize with Qualls's character, because I was the underdog in high school.  I was a blip on the radar screen as the movie's character says. And watching him gain popularity, though via stupid reasons, raised my spirits.  And I also found it touching when the jocks were picking on the midget and Qualls made them apologize to him.  And the last thing that makes this movie somewhat of a guilty pleasure is the many beautiful chicks. I've said before that Eliza Dushku is one of the most beautiful actresses in Hollywood, and I stand by my word.  In one scene, she marches out the dressing room of a clothing store in all sorts of bikinis and low-cut dresses, modeling them for Qualls.  Though I know that would never happen, it's a great fantasy and I get to see Eliza half-naked!  So I ain't complaining.  Plus, there's a lot of gratuitous shots of scantily clad cheerleaders and that chick who plays the town slut is a major babe!Don't expect any surprises (minus the cameos).  The movie is totally predictable, but it's harmless fluff (after the first 30 minutes) that ain't as torcherous as your average teen flick.  It's a shame that DJ Qualls went from playing the hilarious Kyle on Road Trip to the moderately funny Dizzy in this movie, but hopefully his next movie will offer a much better role. One major flaw in this movie is it's set in Texas (and probably shot somewhere in California that looks kinda like Texas) and other than Lyle Lovett and Illeana Douglas, nobody has a Texas accent!My score  5 (out of 10)       ","genre":null},{"date":"29 August 2002","score":"1 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":"  The New Guy gets off to a very slow start, abusing us with crass humor including a teacher getting videotaped as he relieves himself in the bathroom and the main character (literally) getting his penis broken.
