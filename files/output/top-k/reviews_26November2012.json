There are just the right pauses between utterances and before cuts. The audience can not only follow what's happening but can savor the moments if they're any good.

Prior to this the Coen brother's 'Blood Simple' attempted to revive the genre, but the industry was changing with the shift in audience's movie preferences. However this is more akin to being a sex thriller which also happens to incorporate a suspense element. 'Basic Instinct' takes the viewer back in time to the golden era of cinema when the femme fatales were glamorising the screen and became every male's dream fantasy. The film has been considered a classic and has not dated with time. The theme has been beautifully been One of my cult classic favourites from the 1990s. Whenever I catch a scene randomly on television, it brings back nostalgic memories of my childhood. I can still remember waking in the middle of the night just so I could record this movie secretly on my VCR. This is the movie that catapulted stone's career to international stardom. She immediately became a sex symbol and every man began dreaming of her. She immortalised a role that was so deep in characterisation. 'Catherine Trammel' was someone that was not only devious but smart, clever and manipulative. A role model so to speak that will certainly serve as an influence to many aspiring actresses and writers in the future. The role possessed every element that a negative character would have. Joe Esterhas is the writer. Previously he wrote 'Flash dance' and 'jagged edge' Most of his themes are similar. All negative roles about killers and murderers. 'Showgirls' and 'Jade' were also adapted for the screen. Unfortunately they failed at the box office and did not work. I think the audiences had higher expectations. 'Basic Instinct' has a fantastic script. This is the reason why the film worked. And then there is Paul Verhoeven who is a well known director in his home land. He has beautifully combined sex with the suspense genre. I am not very familiar with his Dutch movies. But he always had the style of depicting the theme of 'sex' as a weapon. I enjoyed the movie immensely, and being more of a reader than a movie- goer I jumped at the chance to read the book subsequent to seeing the motion picture. However, I feel that much of which made the movie great owes gratitude to the incredible soundtrack, imagery and skill of the actors; sometimes movies can be successfully novelised, but with Basic Instinct being the stimulus-rich move that it is I feel this was a failed attempt. The characters come off as threadbare and unexplored, lacking in depth or substance of any kind, and the seductively dark tone of the movie is lost on the page; it becomes rather humdrum and glancing, as if each page were written to keep up with the flow of the movie to be read within the hour. Where I was hoping to see some of the twisted, genius logic of Catherine Tramell explored on the page instead I found her to be de-powered, humanised and lacking of a great deal of her appeal as a result. It's worth the read for big fans of the Basic Instinct movies if only to explore the idea through a different form of media, (SPOILER) A San Francisco police detective who is investigated the murder of a retired rock star. The main suspect happens to be a novelist. She is under suspicion. She is released due to lack of evidence. Meanwhile the detective has maintains his belief that she is involved. He decides to pursue her and monitor her movements. The deeper his investigation proceeds, he succumbs to her charm and falls in love in spite knowing he is risking his life. His infatuation distances him from people around him and he refuses to listen to others. People he know become murdered. Eventually he finds it difficult to accept that she is a murderer as he begins to doubt his psychiatrist's past. (END OF SPOILER) The film is made with a sexy noir thriller tone. It brings back memories of Lawrence Kasden's 'Body Heat'. This was the last time a lead actress made an impression with a memorable role. Kathleen Turner became a popular star. At many moments the film feels like a horror thriller. There are many scenes that evoke a frightening feeling. What makes 'Basic Instinct' so unique is we are watching a women manipulating us with her attractive appeal that makes us want to believe she can be a killer. Her seductive charm works on the male protagonist, which leads to confusion. At the end we are eager to want to see her apprehended because we are disgusted how someone can desire to get away with murder for no reason. The sex scenes were unique and were the closest that could be categorised as 'soft porn'. This was one of the appealing factors that mad the film a success. 'Basic Instinct' has sustained it's quality over the years. It has managed to preserve it's quality and has not paled in front of movies that released recently. Due credit goes to Sharon Stone's performance and a winning script by Esterhas. The movie does follow true to the noir conventions. Anyone who is familiar with this will be able to notice them.

Roger Ebert calls it his number one favorite and it is believed to have revolutionized the world of cinema, as it was known during its time. That sort of compliment carries more weight and depth than many realize. While I would not go so far as to call Citizen Kane the greatest movie ever made, it cannot be denied that it is a work of extreme ambition which defied conventional standards and deserves to be recognized and respected for its brilliance. It's my belief that few understand the courage that was needed to stand against up William Randolph Hearst, a very influential figure in American media and politics, whose ambition, like Orson Welles, knew no bounds. After learning about the unflattering portrayal of him in first feature film of the 24-year-old Welles, Hearst went out of his way to ensure that the production never saw the light of day. To my great relief, he did not succeed. The great potential of Welles became known during his time at the Mercury Theater. Although he was a newcomer to the film industry, he was granted total control of his signature work and had many of his theatrical colleagues to assist him. Even a novice at filmmaking sorely lacking in experience can go far with a good editor and director of photography. Welles took all the credit, but it's more than likely that without the luxury of cinematographer Gregg Toland and young editor Robert Wise, Citizen Kane would not be as praised as it is today. A portrait of William Randolph Hearst's life, Citizen Kane follows the events of Charles Foster Kane's death. Reporter Jerry Thompson is tasked with uncovering the meaning of Kane's dying word Rosebud. Was Kane a good man, an egotistical tyrant, or a sympathetic tragic figure? Thompson interviews everyone who was close to Kane, providing the audience the opportunity to examine the titular character through their perspectives. Deprived of a normal childhood, Kane attended and failed in a number of schools before gaining control of the sensational newspaper The New York Inquirer and eventually entering politics. A man of noble intentions, he degraded into a megalomaniac over time, leaving him empty and alone in the end. The meaning of Rosebud remains a mystery to the characters in the movie but not to the audience, as a sled from his youth, the only time when Kane was ever truly happy, is burned with the rest of his forgotten treasures. Citizen Kane can be considered a textbook of cinematic techniques. Even if you are not impressed by the collection of memorable and well developed characters or the means by which the story is told, from a technical standpoint the film is groundbreaking, with atmospheric and environmental effects used to convey the plot and the brilliant use of cinematography to capture all the emotion and mystery through the use of varied angles and darkness. All in all, simply impossible not to appreciate!How unfortunate it is that Citizen Kane received a negative critical reception upon its release and failed to win all but one Oscar (Best Writing, Original Screenplay) out of its nine nominations. Orson Welles was a born artist who lost everything as Kane did and spent the rest of his life trying to live up to the promise shown in his magnum opus. His career declined, but his legacy will forever stand as a testament to one man's creative vision and the steps he was willing to take to fight for his dreams. There are those who claim that Citizen Kane is overrated. Is that so? Perhaps. But regardless, there is much to be admired for avid filmmakers and anyone else who enjoys a thought-provoking narrative experience. One thing I can say with certainty is that the efforts of Orson Welles were not in vain.

","genre":"Drama, Mystery"},{"date":"26 November 2012","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Orson Welles' Citizen Kane is reputed to be the greatest movie of all time. Roger Ebert calls it his number one favorite and it is believed to have revolutionized the world of cinema, as it was known during its time. That sort of compliment carries more weight and depth than many realize. While I would not go so far as to call Citizen Kane the greatest movie ever made, it cannot be denied that it is a work of extreme ambition which defied conventional standards and deserves to be recognized and respected for its brilliance. It's my belief that few understand the courage that was needed to stand against up William Randolph Hearst, a very influential figure in American media and politics, whose ambition, like Orson Welles, knew no bounds. After learning about the unflattering portrayal of him in first feature film of the 24-year-old Welles, Hearst went out of his way to ensure that the production never saw the light of day. To my great relief, he did not succeed. The great potential of Welles became known during his time at the Mercury Theater. Although he was a newcomer to the film industry, he was granted total control of his signature work and had many of his theatrical colleagues to assist him. Even a novice at filmmaking sorely lacking in experience can go far with a good editor and director of photography. Welles took all the credit, but it's more than likely that without the luxury of cinematographer Gregg Toland and young editor Robert Wise, Citizen Kane would not be as praised as it is today. A portrait of William Randolph Hearst's life, Citizen Kane follows the events of Charles Foster Kane's death. Reporter Jerry Thompson is tasked with uncovering the meaning of Kane's dying word Rosebud. Was Kane a good man, an egotistical tyrant, or a sympathetic tragic figure? Thompson interviews everyone who was close to Kane, providing the audience the opportunity to examine the titular character through their perspectives. Deprived of a normal childhood, Kane attended and failed in a number of schools before gaining control of the sensational newspaper The New York Inquirer and eventually entering politics. A man of noble intentions, he degraded into a megalomaniac over time, leaving him empty and alone in the end. The meaning of Rosebud remains a mystery to the characters in the movie but not to the audience, as a sled from his youth, the only time when Kane was ever truly happy, is burned with the rest of his forgotten treasures. Citizen Kane can be considered a textbook of cinematic techniques. Even if you are not impressed by the collection of memorable and well developed characters or the means by which the story is told, from a technical standpoint the film is groundbreaking, with atmospheric and environmental effects used to convey the plot and the brilliant use of cinematography to capture all the emotion and mystery through the use of varied angles and darkness.

There is so much in this film that disgusts me, such as General Bloodbath McGrath(Ted Levine), and Arlin Loveless (Kenneth Brannagh). It is more than just the characterisations, but the characters themselves. The scene where McGrath empties the ear fluid out of his ear, and simply seeing Loveless with half a body trundle around on a wheeled contraption simply turns my stomach.Then there is the mixing of the characters of West and Gordon. It simply does not seem to work. James West (Will Smith) is a smooth talking, fast shooting, Negro cowboy and Artimes Gordon (Kevin Kleine) is the smart inventor of all strange contractions who also happens to be a US Marshall. Personally, the pairing of these two characters simply does not seem to work, at all. I simply won't even suggest that the whole idea of a heroic Negro in the immediate post civil war period doesn't work, but then again, is this not simply an attempt to rewrite history.Of course, there is the idea of transporting us back to the mid-nineteenth century where industrialisation was taking hold, and then once again rewriting history by adding all these wonderful inventions (the tank, the motorbike, and the aeroplane) years before they actually appeared. Okay, they do say that we shouldn't take this film seriously, but there is significant difference between farce, which you are not supposed to take seriously (such as The Simpsons and Futurama, and even then the Simpsons can take farce just that little too far) and outright stupidity. This film clearly falls into the second category.Simply put, this movie puts a serious stain on the the resume of both Kenneth Branagh and Will Smith. Men in Black was silly, but it was still a good movie. This movie was simply just plain silly. It isn't even a Western, the only thing that makes it such is that it set in the 1800s. There is no taming of the barbaric lands, but rather an evil scientist that must be defeated. In fact, this film seems to take the opposite of the Western where the progress fights between itself, with the good inventor that is Artemis Gordon fighting the evil inventor that is Arlin Loveless.One final thing, while it makes the Negro the hero, it then in turn insults me to no end by turning the disabled white man into the villain who, no longer being able to have sex due to his disability, surrounds himself with beautiful woman as a way of compensating himself and showing off to the rest of the world that he is still a man.

As the picture begins, we get this fabulous quasi-documentary narrative with Robert De Niro, as the film's protagonist&#x97;nobody with any sense of morality can call a mob figure a hero&#x97;providing us all the details. What he's been given to say is fascinating, and the way Scorsese coordinates his camera is superb. The technique is pure, the edits are crisp and clean (there are none of those horrendous, in-your-face jump cuts that stabbed his 2006 film The Departed clean through the heart), and the amount of detailed information presented in an entertaining way. Scorsese and his co-screenwriter, Nicolas Pileggi, both of whom collaborated on the 1990 gangster masterpiece GoodFellas, are certainly to be commended as researchers. In this fabulous first half-hour, they know just when and where to tell us data about how the mob ran a Las Vegas casino and when to show us. They tell us who watches who during a big gambling night, and show us, in splendid detail, how to get rid of a cardsharp by giving him a bogus heart attack.Unfortunately, for me, once Sharon Stone, as a prostitute who sets the protagonist's heart aflame, enters the picture, everything begins to drag. This is not a negative reflection on Sharon Stone's performance. Not only is this her best piece of work that I'm aware of&#x97;I personally do not think she's untalented as an actress&#x97;but she gives the best performance of the entire movie. There isn't a bad performance, really, but she does dominate everybody else in Casino. So it's not her acting that wears out the movie for me; it's the pretentious and uninteresting melodrama that follows in her tracks.The pseudo-romantic dynamic between De Niro and Stone is, at heart, just an old-fashioned gangster-and-his-moll story, with the feisty woman first being pushed around, then pushing back, standing up to the boyfriend with the gun. Why does this dynamic go wrong? Because the screenplay tries to make something monumentally important out of it all. It tries to go deep, explore the psyches of both characters, takes them out of the casino and into the deserts and apartments of Las Vegas, and attempts to bring a psychologically fascinating angle to their relationship. Here, it completely falls apart, and the remaining two and a half hours of the movie&#x97;the middle in particularly&#x97;really begins to drag. The other problem with this relationship is that De Niro's character is not interesting when the movie tries to explore his depth as a person. He's much more interesting in the old-fashioned personality of the 'rough-and-touch, silent but deadly' casino manager who, save for his cameras, supervises everything that goes in his establishment. Once he gets all mucky and muggy with Stone, the fascination is wiped clean from the slate. As was my ability to stay interested.I wish that Casino had stayed inside the casinos and not gone into the deserts, apartments, swamps, of outer Las Vegas. For me, the heart of the movie was contained in that big, luxurious building with the omnipresent colors. And I do not see why the movie could not have just stayed there and told its story from that setting, venturing outside only when necessary. Obviously, it's based on true events, but since the true events, as told on screen, become this dull, what's the point? Even Joe Pesci, essentially repeating his performance from GoodFellas, seems to have little purpose outside the casino. There's some promising sequences with him forcing De Niro to come down in the middle of the night to get him fifty million-dollar chips for a gambling rage, but, once again, once the story leaves the casino and starts getting involved with all the other stuff, it goes downhill.But to the filmmakers' credit, having Pesci narrate part of the story does make his denouement all the more surprising. I will not give away exactly what happens, but the way things unfold toward the end, with Pesci's narration almost completely eradicating De Niro's, really does leave the audience unexpected for what eventually turns out. It's a brilliant touch.I admired the physical production values of Casino as much as any great-looking movie I've ever seen, and Scorsese's flair as a director is very impressive. But even though the technique is pure, the storytelling seems half-baked and uninterested in itself. And that's the coldest feeling a movie can possibly give you.

I will like to say it is a nice watch and something to own and keep for later as you will love to see it years after, just to see the two (Peter and Hook) go at it again and if you are like me to see the Croc try to get Hook again.www.lagsreviews.com ","genre":"Animation, Adventure, Family"},{"date":"26 November 2012","score":"12 out of 16 people found the following review useful","review":" There is a lot to admire about Alfred Hitchcock's Dial M for Murder, and I do hold the film with a great deal of admiration and respect. However, what I adore about the movie the most (more than the cinematography, the suspense, the acting, and even the direction) is the work by screenwriter Frederick Knott. Mr. Knott based the screenplay for Dial M for Murder on his successful stage production, which I have never seen, but am told contains almost all of the words we hear in the film. And the words are music to the ears. They sing with intelligence, wit that Mr. Hitchcock certainly found attractive, and, best of all, an easy transition to the screen. Many times when a stage production goes to film, as far as I am concerned, the results, even if good, are uneven. Frequently, the dialogue and restricted set space allowed tend to give off the impression of a filmed play, not a cinematic experience. Another Hitchcock film, 1948's Rope, though valiant, interesting, and successful, attempted this and suffered from this difficult struggle.But the dialogue, put on film here, is exceptional. I write this review having seen Dial M for Murder two or three times and wanting to see it once again. Many reviewers, myself included, have tried watching films with the sound off. I want to try the opposite. I want to close my eyes and just listen to the dialogue because it's so strong. The MacGuffin conversation at the beginning, with a perfectly cast Ray Milland blackmailing a perfectly cast Anthony Dawson into murdering a perfectly cast Grace Kelly is brilliantly written by Mr. Knott. It was clearly from a stage production, as it explains the plot background in great detail, and goes on for the better part of twenty minutes. Both men are fleshed out, giving us their personalities and individual tendencies. And even though Dial M for Murder pretty much stays on just one small set (an apartment in London, in which we see mostly the foyer, a little of the bedroom, and just a glimpse of the kitchen), what happens there is so fascinating that we do not really want to venture out into the city.And that is just the setup. The dialogue remains insistently interesting and clever throughout the picture. It also has that subtle, dark sense of humor that Alfred Hitchcock was keen on. It also has the ironic touches, such as when Mr. Milland, as the jealous husband, kisses his unfaithful wife on the night she is to be murdered, and tells her Goodbye, my dear. The audience, having been given every single little detail about the scheme and how it is to unfold, cringes with a dark realization that Mr. Hitchcock might just go through with Mr. Milland's plot. Mr. Hitchcock, as the director, is also due tremendous credit for his trademark of creating tension. Screenwriter Knott brilliantly lays out for the audience, not the victim, how the murder will go through, but Mr. Hitchcock's camera dutifully follows everything as the scheme goes along. And, before we realize it, if something starts to go wrong, we become scared and tense. And you can imagine my guilt when I realized I was feeling scared that a plan to murder someone just might not go through. It's Mr. Hitchcock's gift at work.Dimitri Tiomkin, a very good film composer, hits all the write notes; that includes knowing when he needs to tell his violins and trumpets to shut up. Robert Burks' cinematography is also strong with effective usage of shadows and streaks of light. Colors are omnipresent. And even though Dial M for Murder was shot with the intent to be seen in 3D, it is hardly evident. When I first saw the film, in much superior 2D, I did not mind the lamps and such in the foreground, such as when one bisects the screen between Ray Milland and Anthony Dawson during the opening sequence. I just thought it was a clever piece of filmmaking and misc en scene, not a cheap gimmick like in most 3D movies today.

Many of the elements that became classic set pieces in the films started here the equipment briefing from Q (Desmond Llewelyn's debut), the dangerous assassin henchman (Robert Shaw's Red Grant), Bloefeld (seen in limited glimpses of his hands, but not his face), and amazing vehicle stunts (the Dr. No car chase notwithstanding...). The film ups the intrigue, with a more complicated plot, while continuing the trend of beautiful women and exotic locations.The film opens with one of the most memorable teasers, as it appears that the film with have a very short running time. We see Red Grant quickly dispatch Bond, only to discover that he is a double and this is a SPECTRE training exercise. This serves to introduce Grant as a truly deadly threat, while giving a glimpse at how resourceful SPECTRE really is. We see SPECTRE assemble a team of specialists Kronstein (Vladek Shebal) the chess master and planner, Rosa Klebb(Lotta Lenya) the KGB officer\/traitor and field commander, Red Grant (Robert Shaw) the previously seen assassin, and Tatiana (Daniella Bianchi) the Russian cypher clerk who is a pawn in SPECTRE's game of revenge.We meet back up with our hero, interrupting another tryst with Sylvia Trench, a feature that ends here. Bond is briefed on his mission, though he suspects a trap, and we are introduced to Desmond Llewelyn as Q, complete with an attaché case that provides just about everything a superspy could need, apart from a cocktail shaker. Bond is dispatched to Istanbul, a favorite setting for spies and intrigue. He soon meets the best ally character ever seen in the film (or books), Kerim Bey (Pedro Armendariaz). From there, Bond and SPECTRE begin to cross paths.The film wonderfully mixes action pieces with character moments, shifting from loud and exciting to quiet and intriguing. It has one of the most memorable casts of characters (and actors) and has nary a wasted moment. It features numerous memorable scenes, from our introduction to Bloefeld (mostly heard, barely glimpsed), the spying from the canals under Istanbul, the gypsy camp, the fight on the train, to the daring escape, and closing fight. There is something here for everyone. There is action, romance, tension, masterful character performances, a cat and mouse game, double bluffs, and pulse pounding chases. Few of the subsequent films would have such a near-perfect balance.Although the film seems somewhat dated now, it is probably the best introduction to the series and the film that will likely make a fan out of the viewer. There are few lapses in logic, or things played too comedically. It's rather chauvinistic, but that's Bond. If I have one quibble, it's the unresolved plot device of SPECTRE Island. We are introduced to the training center for SPECTRE agents, yet we never return to it again (in part due to the lawsuits and rights issues surrounding Thunderball and SPECTRE). Did SPECTRE abandon the base? Was it force to sell it off after suffering repeated setbacks at the hands of Bond? Did they turn it into a timeshare resort? Was it sold to finance the volcano base and rocket? It's ironic that FRWL is the film that really established bond, despite the previous effort, as it was the book that launched the film series. Fleming's novels weren't big sellers in the US until FRWL appeared on a list of President Kennedy's favorite books. Sales of it and other Bond novels skyrocketed and a series was launched. It's funny to think that Fleming had actually written it to kill off Bond (though he left the door open, by making Bond's fate open to interpretation).

After that I remember every one getting on the band wagon and stating how silly they thought the movie was. My poking-fun had gone viral so to speak. Well, I won't say what I did, but it was one of the last major cultural influences my posts would have for a very long time. Now that the net is a bit more democratized I don't have to worry about my words hitting major network outlets like they used to. Fortunately The Sound of Music was resilient enough to endure a little ridicule.But I digress. To the film.This is essentially a musical remake of a German film entitled The Family Von Trapp, which tells the same story with less music and more drama. The Rogers and Hammerstein version was another Hollywood take on Nazi Germany, but keeps the fair light as it is understood when the deplorable political situation was in Germany, ergo the focus is on the Von Trapps and their escapade to form into a family and leave Austria which is under the German sphere of influence.I've always loved this film as a film. I'm a guy who's comfortable enough with his masculinity to say that I liked the song and dance numbers in this film, and have always done so. So, when I paid homage to the songs in this film in the late 90s, I wasn't trying to ridicule the film, nor create the social tidal wave of that musical movie is silly and stupid (which, again thankfully retreated into obscurity), but I was honestly trying to just use some well know references in the film in other forums. I think the songs, the story, and just over all production values are first class. And one could expect no less from one of Hollywood's first class directors, Robert Wise. The man who brought us West Side Story, Run Silent, Run Deep, The Desert Rats and The Day the Earth Stood Still to name but a few of his landmark films.Julie Andrews gives us a free spirited novice who is trying desperately to become a nun by showing her devotion to what she loves most about living; the great outdoors and the music that it inspires within her. Christopher Plummer is in his prime when he portrays Captain Von Trapp, formerly of the Austrian Navy, and we can see his serious side as an actor come forth, along with an underscoring of tenderness.The supporting cast all do their parts to help sustain and suspend both the film's reality and the reality we are trying to escape when we watch the Sound of Music. No one misses a cue here in terms of performance, and performances carry this film from frame one.Technical notes; on the DVD documentary it is mentioned that Captain Von Trapp did not like the Nazi regime for a variety of reasons, but this is only every touched on in one dramatic scene, and the emotional thrust of the captain's position is given, but we are not privy to the more real and pragmatic reasons of why and what makes him and us not like the Nazis in the first place. But, the film works regardless, because it is a musical and not a political diatribe. The cinematography is basic, but also breathtaking, particularly in the opening sequences. We are given some very inviting panoramic vistas of settled regions within the Alps-incredible stuff. The musical numbers are well crafted and help suspend reality outside the film to make the fantasy we are watching more inviting and enjoyable. If I had one critique, it's the same critique that I have with all films prior to 1970; studio rear-screen projection car shots. I remember the hack tour guide at Universal telling us how realisitic this process was when shooting a scene that required the actors\/characters be inside a moving vehicle. My reaction then is as it is now; give me a break. If you need characters in a car, then put them in a car and have a grip truck tow them with a camera mounted on the back, or mount a camera on the car itself, and let the actors drive for goodness sake.Otherwise the film is marvelous. If you're in the mood for some light entertainment, something with familial appeal, that has some seriousness to it, but is not weighed down by political overtones, then give The Sound of Music a chance.Until then; so long, fare well, alveterzane, good bye.

To the film.This is essentially a musical remake of a German film entitled The Family Von Trapp, which tells the same story with less music and more drama. The Rogers and Hammerstein version was another Hollywood take on Nazi Germany, but keeps the fair light as it is understood when the deplorable political situation was in Germany, ergo the focus is on the Von Trapps and their escapade to form into a family and leave Austria which is under the German sphere of influence.I've always loved this film as a film. I'm a guy who's comfortable enough with his masculinity to say that I liked the song and dance numbers in this film, and have always done so. So, when I paid homage to the songs in this film in the late 90s, I wasn't trying to ridicule the film, nor create the social tidal wave of that musical movie is silly and stupid (which, again thankfully retreated into obscurity), but I was honestly trying to just use some well know references in the film in other forums. I think the songs, the story, and just over all production values are first class. And one could expect no less from one of Hollywood's first class directors, Robert Wise. The man who brought us West Side Story, Run Silent, Run Deep, The Desert Rats and The Day the Earth Stood Still to name but a few of his landmark films.Julie Andrews gives us a free spirited novice who is trying desperately to become a nun by showing her devotion to what she loves most about living; the great outdoors and the music that it inspires within her. Christopher Plummer is in his prime when he portrays Captain Von Trapp, formerly of the Austrian Navy, and we can see his serious side as an actor come forth, along with an underscoring of tenderness.The supporting cast all do their parts to help sustain and suspend both the film's reality and the reality we are trying to escape when we watch the Sound of Music. No one misses a cue here in terms of performance, and performances carry this film from frame one.Technical notes; on the DVD documentary it is mentioned that Captain Von Trapp did not like the Nazi regime for a variety of reasons, but this is only every touched on in one dramatic scene, and the emotional thrust of the captain's position is given, but we are not privy to the more real and pragmatic reasons of why and what makes him and us not like the Nazis in the first place. But, the film works regardless, because it is a musical and not a political diatribe. The cinematography is basic, but also breathtaking, particularly in the opening sequences. We are given some very inviting panoramic vistas of settled regions within the Alps-incredible stuff. The musical numbers are well crafted and help suspend reality outside the film to make the fantasy we are watching more inviting and enjoyable. If I had one critique, it's the same critique that I have with all films prior to 1970; studio rear-screen projection car shots. I remember the hack tour guide at Universal telling us how realisitic this process was when shooting a scene that required the actors\/characters be inside a moving vehicle. My reaction then is as it is now; give me a break. If you need characters in a car, then put them in a car and have a grip truck tow them with a camera mounted on the back, or mount a camera on the car itself, and let the actors drive for goodness sake.Otherwise the film is marvelous. If you're in the mood for some light entertainment, something with familial appeal, that has some seriousness to it, but is not weighed down by political overtones, then give The Sound of Music a chance.Until then; so long, fare well, alveterzane, good bye.

I would probably suggest that it is a film that upon its original release there was not much interest or support with it, but over time, as more and more people discover it, it gains in popularity. Repo Man I suspect is one of those movies, and I suspect these movies (like this one) gain in popularity because as children grow into adults the film begins to appeal to a wider audience. However there are other films, such as Pulp Fiction, that are considered cult classics, but that has more to do with Quentin Tarrantino having a dedicate fan base.This film is about the people who live in the cracks in society, the people that are strange, different, and are generally ignored, ridiculed, or hated by the mainstream, and I guess that is why it appeals to people. In fact, almost every character in the film would fall into one of those cracks. We have Otto' parents who are caught up in a religious cult, and we have the punks who wonder around committing crimes, and we have the group running around looking for UFOs, and we have the Repomen themselves, who live a life legally stealing cars. Then we have Otto, the protagonist of the film, who seems to get caught up in each of these cracks, but in a way belongs to none of them.The film is actually about a 1964 Chevy Malibu, a car in and of itself not having much value or interest, and it is not in a condition that would make it attractive to anybody, but for some reason quite a few people want this particular car. In fact, among the circles of the repomen it carries with it a price tag of $20000.00 (we learn in the movie that repomen are basically independent contractors, and they earn their keep on collecting commissions on cars that they repossess).The special effects in this film are pretty ordinary, but then what would one expect from a low budget film made in the mid-80s, but what it lacks in effects it easily makes up in it pure otherworldliness. Repoman takes us outside of the dull existence that we live in and throws us into the world of the strange and the bizarre, and then even takes us away from that world in the end, as it also takes Otto away from it as well. Otto is your quintessential nobody, not an everyman, but an everynobody. In a way he relates to that part of us that is disconnected with the rest of the world, the characters in this movie also share in those parts of us that are disconnected with the world. In a way this film appeals to us that do not feel that we belong, but in a way shows us that there is always a place for us where those who believe they belong, in the end are rejected.Let us consider the end for the moment, where everybody who is after the Malibu are rejected, and it is Otto and the mechanic that are accepted by the Malibu, and are in essence taken away. Once again we see the Western meta-narrative appear in this ending where those who believe that deserve salvation, and have earned salvation, are rejected in favour of those who simply trust. Granted, Otto is not really a man of faith, but by the end of the film he has learned to cast aside all of the false advice, that of his parents, of his friends, and even of the repoman Bud, to simply trust the mechanic, open the door, and climb into the car to be taken away, while we see the girl, the one he once pursued, stamping her feet and crying out that it should have been her getting into that car.

He is simple, suave, and boasts his slick swagger in every scene, with his large vocabulary and polite yet womanizing nature consuming the viewer. After the mysterious disappearance of a British spy agent, Bond (or 007, if you will) is shipped to Jamaica, to try and track down Dr. Julius No (Joseph Wiseman), a man who houses a headquarters that is trying to disrupt a space launch by using a large radio beam. Bond teams up with Quarrel (John Kitzmiller), an islander who works closely with Bond's CIA operative (John Lord) and the gorgeous shell-diver Honey Ryder (Ursula Andress), who makes a living selling shells to people along the land.By the plot itself, this is simple, effective entertainment, and by just saying the story, we get the impression that this is another entry in the long, winded genre of popcorn action flicks. On the contrary, this is a stylish espionage film, introducing us to the character of James Bond with plenty of dialog for the fanbase and interesting spy setups for those who demand less. There's something here for everyone, and for someone who lacks extensive knowledge on the field of espionage pictures, let alone British espionage films which I am told beat those in American cinema second to none, I was given a helping hand from the moment after the opening credits.Tonally, this is an uneven picture, but it rebounds and catches itself nicely before we extend the boundaries of credibility or believability. The opening sequence involving the Three Blind Mice could've set up a very, very different film. Writers Richard Maibaum, Johanna Harwood, and Berkely Mather discipline Dr. No's screenplay so as not to welcome too many incredulous nonsense like car chases or on-foot chase sequences. And when we do get them, they are superbly styled because of the crafty camera-work by Terrence Howard and vivid visuals.Going back to Connery's wonderful performance, he is only assisted with the talent provided by Andress and Kitzmiller. Kitzmiller's Quarrel is sadly underwritten, and to see the three characters engage in more spy activity, dialog, and exploration would've elevated Dr. No to more subversive espionage heights. Still, the first and second half pick up in the fields of dialog, while the last fifty minutes provide those seeking something of traditional style spy flicks with the fun, uncertainty, and the suspense of it all.Dr. No is significant in the fact that it pretty much molded what Bond movies would later become about; style, substance, the eccentric nature of its central character, and beautiful location photography (the exterior shots of the Jamaican beach and seascape are exuberant and captivating). From what I hear, this is a tamer, more low-key Bond film than many of the slicker, more action-oriented pictures of Roger Moore, Pierce Brosnan, or in modern-day's case, Daniel Craig. For me, Dr. No erects a simple, satisfying formula I wouldn't object to seeing more of, and more of its title character's swagger in limitations wouldn't be a bad thing either.Starring Sean Connery, Ursula Andress, John Kitzmiller, and John Lord.

While listening to only a few songs, it's hard to tell. But back to back it is clearly evident. This movie shows that story and features the entire album explaining the story. The main character, coincidentally, is named Pink. The story basically shows the process from when he was a child up to his adulthood how he got trapped behind a wall of isolation from society.

As such, as an adolescent weaned on extreme horror, I salivated at the lifting of the ban in the UK in the late 90s and the news it would be given a TV screening. And so&#x85;one fateful evening I sat down and braced myself. Afterwards, I was left with a distinct feeling of meh.Looking back, this was a naïve response owing a lot to having expected a lot of gory Tom Savini-style kills and an inflated body count which I had seen so much of in countless other slashers (which Texas&#x85;, released the same year as Black Christmas and Silent Night, Bloody Night, is considered an early example of). However, with subsequent re-watches I came to appreciate that while the film isn't gore heavy (and only one victim is actually off-ed with a chainsaw) instead the strength of the movie is in its ominous sense of lurking dread which builds from portentous stirrings upto its hysterical, frenzied Leatherface-flailing-about-with-a-chainsaw finale. Indeed, so pervasive is this atmosphere that BBFC chief censor James Ferman banned it on the grounds that whichever way he cut the film the stifling claustrophobic terror remained.As such, in combination with being (slightly) less parodied and milked by franchises than other notable slasher entries, this lack of gore in preference to claustrophobia has meant it has aged fairly well (as nothing dates quicker than special effects and fake blood). The film also has quite a strong sense of believability due to its low budget influenced quasi-documentary style, its inspiration from real life serial killer Ed Gein (who also served as the inspiration for Psycho), that the fact that the shooting was characterised by time constraints, searing heat, and the stench of rotting animal flesh which made a lot of the hysteria seen on screen more real than would be expected.All told, I'm sure some will still try to sniffy and say it's dated, rubbish, and not scary etc. but frankly they're missing the point. The movie was and remains an underground horror classic which, along with Night of the Living Dead and Halloween, not only has the prestige of having shaped subsequent generations of horror movies, but which can still go toe-to-toe with any of today's offerings when it comes to a crushing sense of primal terror.

Minor roles are filled by stalwarts Martin Benson and Burt Kwouk among the usual Bond outfit (Lee, Maxwell, Llewellyn).The golfing match in which Bond trumps Goldfinger is a classic film moment, Oddjob's statue-destroying response manifests his boss' displeasure at being out-maneuvered, a forceful statement of intimidation that, predictably, Bond fails to heed, heading for an equally memorable encounter with a laser beam (in which Goldfinger and his cronies have so much faith, that no one stays to ensure Bond is actually bisected as planned, with predictable results).

Maryam d'Abo and Virginia Hey play the Bond girls, though Dalton is a less convincing chick-magnet, projecting a more professional, workman-like image. I liked Dalton in the Bond role; he offers a relaxed kind of determination, but the smart remarks demanded of the script don't suit his demeanour and at times, he seems to be reading dialogue that would suit another actor. Arguable casting missteps aside, that shouldn't detract from the action of The Living Daylights which is first rate among its peers though apparently overlooked during Dalton's brief foray, now considered something of a pause between the larger-than-life egos of Roger Moore and Pierce Brosnan interpretations.
