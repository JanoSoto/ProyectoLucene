In terms of production, camera work, score, and everything-but-the-kitchen-sink scene work, Donald Trump only wishes he were as rich as this film. Taken on that production level, it is almost reminiscent of a weekend with Jim Morrison in terms of excess. But somehow, this overly-sumptuousness works for such a tale as this. And yes, I do agree that in the terms of the original story, this telling is more faithful that the host of other movies made over the decades. If you have not read the original, I highly recommend it, but save it for Samhain )Individual notes Some of the casting in this is positively inspiring, especially Tom Waits as Renfield who was superb. Of course, the ubiquitous Gary Oldman as the Count was a casting inevitability, and he did not disappoint--pulling out so much that he gave new height to The Hilt that most actors aspire to! Boy, if ever there were a candidate for a remake of The 7 Faces Of Dr. Lao...And Sir Anthony Hopkins (slight pause for a reverent bow) captures the exact mood of the entire production in this film--bold, bawdy, lush, wicked and witty. There must have been some secret delight for him to go from the vampiric doctor in Lambs to the vampire-eradicator in this film. What other actor could find so much with so little? Now, the bad notes...I know that Winona Ryder was very keen on doing this film and tried her best, but she tried TOO hard, and it showed. Her accent was almost a caricature of the true British tongue, and she almost sounded like Carol Burnett imitating the Queen on her variety show. One reader commented on and questioned her gasping through the film; it could have been an attempt to look shy and easily frightened, but I'm going to chalk it up to an overly-tight corset. And where Ms. Ryder over-did her part, Mr. Reeves UNDER-did his. I, too, kept waiting for a dude to slip into his speeches. And his pronunciation of certain words had my friends and I giggling hysterically. Which is a shame, because in the book, the part of Jonathon Harker is a major and pivotal role...though not in this film, and I can't help but suspect that the fact that Harker was played by Reeves might be the reason that the Harker character was pared down dramatically from the book for this movie. But, because of the lavishness of the rest of the material, we don't miss it much. And rightly so, for this is not supposed to be a true remake of the book, but rather an experience. The true Victorian feel of the book gives way to the lustiness that would never have been expressed by Stoker (maybe not even realized...??). Why do we feel such sexual magnetism about the legend of the Count? There is something very sensuous about someone entering your mind and exerting intellectual will over yours. This was never more evident than in Lambs, and in this modern version of Dracula. Also, I think what makes Dracula more appealing, particularly to females, is the way he exacts what he needs. Other fabled monsters merely slash, chop, dice, shoot, etc. There is no contact with the victim. But with Dracula, he supersedes the will of the victim by engulfing their will with his, he moves in close over them, draws from them in a kiss of life\/death...but does not kill the women. Instead he makes them his wives. And immortals. So not only does such a character appeal to some secret side of a woman's sexuality, but also feeds the human desire to live forever. That, to me, is why the Count survives as still the most feared, yet feared not, of all the movie monsters. And these facts are what this movie captures - the written fable, the primal desire AND the imagined legend. So to sum up...Goth doesn't get better than this. Be prepared to laugh and lust. Give your will over to the bawdiness, and enjoy--it really is a carnival ride of a film.

Good Will Hunting is an infantile, cliche-strewn, mawkishly sentimental mess.It starts with the a priori assumption that geniuses don't actually work hard at all mentally - they just naturally understand everything because they have a gift or talent (or... 'THE SHINING!'). Now, I don't want to dispute the part about geniuses being talented or gifted. We all know that Einstein or Newton or Mozart or Chopin or Nietzsche were ones in a million. Still, those men did struggle and did engage in serious deep thinking. They didn't have it easy - they challenged themselves.Will Hunting (part of the ambiguous title, where I thought that his last name was actually a verb, before I knew the story) is a genius who knows everything about everything (specializes in all fields, not just one - he just reads a lot and understands it too), except for love, relationships and real life. So, as his superbly insightful therapist (portrayed in a deservedly Oscar-winning performance by Robin Williams) elucidates, Will Hunting is a lost, lonely child in a dangerous, confusing world. And, in the process of challenging the therapist, Will exposes the therapist's own demons and they bond, much like in every other therapist-patient movie - first, through violent resistance and conflict, then to mutual understanding, then to tears and really dramatic hugs.There are also three other subplots in the film, and it's really hard to relate them to the whole. Nonetheless1) There is the relationship between Will and a girl awfully played by the terrible Minnie Driver, one punctuated by Driver's laugh reminiscent of death approaching a starving man in the desert. Awkward Boy meets Crazy, Spoiled but Insightful Girl who assures him that if she could spend a day with her dead father she would give all the inheritance money back - this money, ironically, is what got her through school and allowed her to meet Will.2) A conflict between the therapist and the professor who discovers Will's gift or talent, involving some kind of intellectual jealousy and an eventual forced make-up between the two forces. I assume this conflict is supposed to reveal the therapist as akin to Will and make the therapy sessions more believable, while alienating the selfish intellectual.3) And then, finally, there is the relationship between Will and, God I hate him, Ben Affleck, in yet another role where he plays a cocky b****rd. Sometimes he overacts, a lot of the time he underacts and he's just plain bad. Nonetheless, his relationship to Will eventually sets up the all-too-neat climax where everything resolves itself so well, you wonder what the fuss was about in the first place.So there you have it. A deep, complex psychological film about a guy in conflict and surrounded by conflict. The conflict, while there is a lot of it, is actually very superficial, resolved far too conveniently. While the guy, around which the movie and the childish story so selfishly envelop themselves, is not believable enough to be interesting. He's a tortured genius, a walking cliche - and one hard as hell to relate to. Damon, who I generally like, falters and overacts often, particularly in the prominently dramatic tear-jerking scenes.Consequently, I'm surprised at how much praise this film received. But then again, audiences love cheap laughs, cheap tears and cheap thrills. Good Will Hunting may stray from explosions, but that doesn't mean it's not a formulaic, by the book and terribly false feel-good movie. If you want to see a drama written by two very very rich celebrities about how tough it is in lower-middle class Boston when you're a genius, then Good Will Hunting is your thing.

To their credit, the creative team at Pixar used their brains anyway. Toy Story 2 is enjoyable, at times rousing entertainment the whole family can enjoy, but the sometimes clumsy attempts at injecting seriousness into the first movie have become much more overt and annoying.What's right with Toy Story 2? A lot, beginning with the eyepopping improvements to the animation technology just four years brought. In Toy Story, in 1995, the human characters like Sid and Andy's baby sister looked more cartoonish than the toys, while Sid's vicious pet Scud looked like an escapee from a late-'80s Commodore computer game. By 1999, the humans are so lifelike it hurts, especially if you are fat and balding like Al (and me.)Add to that a clever story arc that allows Woody the cowboy doll (voiced by Tom Hanks) to leave Andy's room and discover his true origins, which turn out to be a great deal more impressive than he imagined. A Howdy Doody-like relic of the 1950s, Woody turns out to be quite a prize antique, especially when paired with fellow members of his old Roundup Gang, as assembled by Al, the owner of a giant toy retailer who has stolen Woody from Andy's mother and plans to sell the set to a big-money collector in Japan.The revelation of Woody's past is pretty clever, especially when we see excerpts of his old show with hilariously bad marionette work. The comedy involving the greedy, porcine Al (Wayne Knight) is well-done, as is the emergency work back in Andy's bedroom to get Woody back where he belongs. The once-acidic Mr. Potato Head (Don Rickles) turns out to be quite the whipped spud now that there's a Mrs. Potato Head (Estelle Harris) in the room. I packed your angry eyes, just in case, she says, and it's dynamite voice casting, like so much in the first movie.I never quite got into the Roundup Gang, however. Joan Cusack tries too hard as the spunky cowgirl Jessie, while Kelsey Grammer, terrific in his work as the Simpsons nemesis Sideshow Bob (an obvious inspiration here) brings nothing new to his role here. They are so dull that you wonder why Woody would even think of spending his time with them.It's ironic that the creators said the story was designed in part to deal with the limited availability of Tom Hanks, because I missed Tim Allen more in this one. Actually, he has a dual role, as two different Buzz Lightyears, one being the space action figure we saw in the first movie, the other being an upgraded version freed from Al's Toy Barn who joins the rescue mission. But the original Buzz, now that he's with the program, is a pale echo of his old self (which was more of a friendly, fair-playing rival of Woody's than a second banana) while the new Buzz recycles a lot of the fish-out-of-water lines old Buzz had in the first film, because, like old Buzz in the first film, he's just out of the box and doesn't know what's what.The movie goes off into some strange existential territory for a while, about the futility of a toy's existence which takes itself very seriously. Woody decides to leave Andy, seeing clearly a future where the boy will chuck him for more grown-up pursuits. One comment I read here asks if this is right; that many children, seeing this movie, might be reluctant to give a toy to charity, which is what we see happen to Jessie here. Worse crimes have been committed in the name of art then discouraging toy donations, but it does feel like this film is advocating an unnaturally backward position upon its core audience.Yeah, okay, enough dime-story philosophy. You will have a good time watching Toy Story 2 if you liked the first one, and most people did. It's funny, fresh, and exciting, especially with the rescue mission, and the animation is spectacular. But why do people say this is the better film? Other than the technology, it's in every way a lesser product.

Fargo has a story as straight as they come.  One kidnapped lady, Two Kidnappers, one desperate man and a policewomen with time on her hands.   That's what you get with Fargo.    Taking it's set in a town where it never seems to stop snowing it hasn't got a claustrophobic feel to it like I would have hoped.  I honestly didn't think much of the film.  The acting was spot on as was the dialogue but it didn't take me back.  I can watch Fargo without flittering an eyelid and enjoy it all the same but I don't enjoy for the reasons I should.  The story was good but I have a feeling it's the kind of narrative I have spotted before in a film and had nothing new to offer. This isn't The Coen Brothers best work, that title goes to Miller's Crossing, The Big Lebowski and The Man Who Wasn't There which are much better films with much better stories but Fargo got all the more praise when it really shouldn't have.  Still this is not the worst film ever, it's just not the best which is what I was lead to believe from the hype but it still makes interesting viewing and has it's moments but I would encourage people to watch other Coen Brothers films instead of this as I don't think you'll be getting what you are looking for.
