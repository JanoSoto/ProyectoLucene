Now, I know I wasn't supposed to, but I couldn't help it. This is the way most of the film ran. It was very ineffective. It had lofty goals that would only work on a gamble, unfortunately, it was double or nothing and they lost everything. There was one scene, or even just monologue, that I do think captured what the whole movie was aiming for, unfortunately it was delivered in a video by a character who was already dead, and none of the other characters or the script or the score or anything else carried on her legacy. One of the problems with this movie was the total lack of emotion it evoked in many situations. Scenes that were supposed to keep one in suspense were annoying, scenes that were supposed to be sad made one laugh or, at times, be disgusted with the stupidity and inanity they were delivered with. The end was a bit interesting, and it had the potential to be very cool, but at that point you just didn't care. Specific problems1. The acting- Great actors=horrible acting? Someone made the comment to me that the great cast couldn't save it. It didn't seem to me that they even tried. In fact, I really *hope* they didn't try because if that is what constituted effort, then perhaps they've all acquired brain damage since their last performances. Maybe they were just horribly miscast.2. The score- This is perhaps what killed everything else. The music itself wasn't of an extremely poor quality, but it was put in all the wrong places. Example- they've just found the key to this huge, secret-of-the-movie puzzle, cue ominous music? No, I'm sorry, if you want us to be excited, don't try to scare us. 3. The script- It wasn't good but I don't think it was as bad as the other two items on the list. It got a few chuckles, and as I said before, the one little scene was good, but overall the dialogue was very poor.I kept hoping there would discover a giant, stuffed, pink bunny named Senor Bob, and then I could laugh at a brilliant satire, but it wasn't to be.

This movie was not only funny, but before the ending credits finished, I found that I thoroughly enjoyed myself.   So much so that I saw it again two days later!The biggest asset of the movie is that Tim Allen was believeable as the heroic Commander.  Instead of dreading another convention full of people with no life, he embraced his celebrity to the fullest and accommodated all his fans.  While his crew fed off his enthusiasm and stayed loyal to him throughout.  Allen was definitely at the heart of this movie, and he made it work very well.The most humorous scenes were the ones where the actors tried to portray their roles for their alien allies and failed miserably.  But once they realized how *important* they were in their respective roles, they easily fit into them like a glove.  This metamorphosis was fun to watch!The supporting cast was excellent, particularly Sigourney Weaver and Tony Shalhoub, and it was obvious that they all liked working with each other.  Though the plot felt a little thin at times, the actors definitely made the majority of the movie enjoyable.  And I found myself feeling like a kid again when the NEW adventures of Galaxy Quest was shown at the end.  I almost wished it were a real series!  I highly recommend seeing this one.

The film also stands against racism and questions several other things concerning our behaviour.Overall an excellent film that is more than just a simple comedy.My rating 10\/10 ","genre":"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy"},{"date":"20 March 2000","score":"","review":"  The same thing happens with a lot of cult hits - mainstream viewers can't figure out what the appeal is, and why the loyal following adores its movie with such affection.Frankly, I think those of us who do get SMB, are quite lucky as this movie is packed with imagination and originality, and is often hilariously clever and charming and sweet (just like Joe Dante's masterwork Innerspace). It's a pop-culture smorgasbord on a caffeine high to PCP-LSD-ecstasy levels. Fairy tales, science fiction, buddy-action, theme parks, and more, all rolled together into a insane other-dimensional funfest.  But as with other unfortunately botched scifi-comedies of the past, you have to look past the studio's inept presentation of SMB, in order to perceive this magic.SMB is perhaps the greatest-ever exploration of 8-year-old boys' sense of just-for-fun make-believe.  You have to watch it in that spirit in order to understand how it's supposed to work. Like Star Wars and The Matrix, but with a campier college-anarchist sense of humor.  And even better, SMB is lavishly brought to us by the set designer of Blade Runner, with an ambient-FX soundtrack that really throttled the capacity of THX and Dolby Digital (in its youth).But most people never make this discovery, since SMB's clumsy directors did a REALLY lousy job (they definitely need to go to film school, perhaps even starting at kindergarten level since they're so incompetent), and Disney really massacred the marketing, trying to make this movie look like Total Recall when really it's more like Kidd Video.I admit that the action scenes are horrible... badly-staged by the directors, who make everything wayyy too slow and phoney, not at all as vibrantly bouncy and fast as the MTV audience would expect.  The tackily tacked-on final scene, is a disgustingly contrived attempt to give this movie a Back to the Future-type finish, even before progressing into credits marred by an awfully dull Roxette love song.  (NOTE to future morons... 8-year-old boys do not want to hear such rubbish).It also doesn't help that the videogame and the movie are so extremely different from each other - sharing names and concepts but nothing more. Most multiplex patrons avoided SMB for fear of garbage, thus only a few folks bothered, and among those few even fewer saw past the poor direction to experience SMB's numerous inner pleasures.It's obvious that producer Roland Joffe (The Mission, Killing Fields) was nervous about how to merge a Nintendo concept with mainstream audience story expectations.  And it's obvious that the script's brilliance failed the communications bridge to the studio and directors.  As a result, every collaborator seemed to have a different idea about how to approach this production, and only the background details survived the ensuing mess.SMB was released on Memorial Day (up against Cliffhanger) and was an instant flop, disappearing by the time 1993's other summer-dinosaur-evolution movie debuted weeks later.  For this and this alone, SMB quickly drew a stenchy reputation alongside such memorable disasters as Howard the Duck and Dick Tracy.Too bad, since this movie was perhaps the high-water-mark in the career of screenwriter Ed Solomon (Men in Black, Bill & Ted).  His other movies were clever, but no where nearly as packed-to-the-brim with pure imagination as this one.  SMB takes his previous originality and warps a billion times higher in a far greater realms of creativity.Sadly, SMB suffers from the same problem that plagued Buckaroo Banzai a decade earlier... both movies had brilliant complicated scripts that are sabotaged by bad directors and poor studio marketing.  Most viewers are thus unable to look past the incompetent presentation of SMB, in order to perceive the treasure within.Dennis Hopper delivers his sleaziest, funniest villain since Blue Velvet's Frank Booth (luxuriating in his penthouse's decadent mudbath, insulting with such lines as You FILTHY...mammal; also listen for his nitpicky pizza demands).  Richard Edsel is even funnier here than in Ferris Bueller. Perhaps the only mis-casting is the villainess - who's played by the same irritating British redhead who plagued 1993's Undercover Blues.The sense of humor is perfect both for youngsters and Monty Python fans... it's GROSS (the police car plunging out of the fungus-tunnel looks like a big booger dropping from a nostril), it's ABSURD (the villain is conquered by a little wind-up toy wearing miniature Reeboks), it's INTELLECTUAL (watch and listen for the many jabs at 20th century political ideology) and CLASSICAL (the Goombas have a fetish for the Dr. Zhivago love-theme).PS.  No, I was not smoking marijuana or mushrooms while watching this movie. It's so much fun, that a drug-induced trip could not possible compare.

One I guess I shouldn't talk about (because she'd probably kill me!). But the other is that I got my first look at 'The Matrix'! All I saw was the one-minute teaser trailer. It looked mysterious! I knew instantly that this was something very different and I just had to see this film. I wanted to know what the 'Matrix' was. And when I found out&#133;! Don't be fooled into thinking that this film is just going to blow you away&#133; it's going to cause your head to explode!  The film has a story that has been described as difficult to explain and hard to understand when watching, but thankfully it wasn't like having to watch Mission Impossible! Without giving the whole thing away this is what's happening. You have Reeves playing Thomas 'Neo' Anderson, a computer programmer for a big company who is also a computer hacker in his spare time and sells the illegal stuff to the ones who want it. But right now Mr Anderson has been having some very bad dreams, dreams that seem so real. He keeps getting told about this 'Matrix' in these strange dreams. I mean just what is this 'Matrix'? Some suspicious black suited men also want him for something. He doesn't want to stick around to find out! Soon someone known as Morpheus (Fishburne) contacts him and explains to him that he also is looking for him, plus he'll tell him about his vivid dreams and he'll explain to him just what the 'Matrix' is. We begin to find out that reality isn't what it seems.  Well what the hell is the 'Matrix'!? Finding out wasn't going to be an easy task. As the tagline said 'Unfortunately no one can be told what the 'Matrix' is.' So I could see that I was going to have to pay my £5 and go find out just like everyone else!  The story is original and very unique, taking a truckload of ideas, thoughts, effects, action and fitting them nicely into something just over 2 hours long. What makes this movie work so well is the strong story element. It's also one of those really rare sci-fi action films that actually makes you think. It raises some questions and it has its own answers. But besides being an education lesson it is extremely entertaining. So entertaining that it's almost unbelievable that such a film can be exposed to the public! It manages to make itself so incredibly cool. Take 'Men in Black' and double it and you're not even half way there. But think a futuristic John Woo film and you're pretty close! Most of the action takes place in the second half of the film where all hell breaks loose. The action is very stylish, very over the top and also well thought out. You don't see someone run up a wall, dodge bullets at high speed and park a helicopter spectacularly in the side of a building in your traditional boring 'let's go shoot some bad guys' action film. This is something very different.  The Matrix will do for special effects what Terminator 2 did for&#133; well, um&#133; special effects! This is ground breaking stuff. Used to a major extent in the film are the Flo-Mo effects where the camera circles around the action. It's unlike anything else and it just looks outstanding! The shootout between Reeves and Weaving as they freeze in mid air, the camera goes 360 degrees around them. It's just unbelievable!  Everyone is cast perfectly in their roles with Reeves and Anne-Moss looking amazingly cool throughout the film. Fishburne looks cool too, and is helped with the fact that his character is highly knowledgeable. But the best performances have to go to those black suited men known as 'Agents', led by Hugo Weaving. They seem so simple and smart, the way they talk with their monotone voices! They are very, very nasty&#133; and I like it!  The speedy fight scenes and use of wire frames all work really well, adding more to the effect of believing the unbelievable! There are so many unforgettable little touches, which make this movie stand out amongst others. The way those bullets slowly fly out and make crisp sounds as they hit the floor, the lush watery effects, even the spoon and of course the woman in red! She's unforgettable! There's also the nice touch of adding in a few hidden features which may make the real enthusiast want to watch the film a couple more times to find everything out. Some will watch it again because they didn't understand it at all (Though it's usually these people that hate the film). But I'm sure most will watch it again for the reason that it's just so damn good!  Those Wachowski brothers have created a masterpiece of a movie. And I'd just like to say well done to them! I knew that if I was only going to see one movie in 1999 (just in case I ended up poor or something!) then it was going to be this!My Rating - I'm afraid I can give it no more then the 10 out of 10 it deserves!

In fact, the death scenes were so freakishly violent and intricate that they were interesting in and of themselves.  Imagine the force of death (not the Grim Reaper, but the phenomenon of accidents, if you will) being MAJORLY p***ed for having missed a few.  Hence the plot.To make matters worse, the director displayed the little things hyper-accurately.  That alone made watching it really hard at times without wincing, flinching or screaming out loud.  (*those who have seen this know EXACTLY what I'm talking about*)As someone who goes to the movies every Friday, I have been waiting for this FOREVER!!Oh, and by movie, I mean MOVIE...  not FILM, not INDIE, not FLICK.  A MOVIE is something that I first hear of through word of mouth, first see a glimpse of via previews of another MOVIE, and, after seeing it, leave the theater flashing back through great scenes and lines for the next few hours saying to myself that was great!Final Destination was a great movie.  They don't make them like this too often.Don't get me wrong, I'm sure if you were looking for flaws you could find them (no movie is perfect), but I wasn't and enjoyed my ride thoroughly as a result.  Personally, I think that if you had the time to pay attention to those flaws while watching it for the very first time, I've got news for you  you missed a great movie.

I thought it looked bad enough that it would be a good laugh to watch it and make fun of it.  No one was more surprised than me to discover that it was actually decent!  It's a dark comedy not at all aimed at kids... I think it will become a great cult film like Return to Oz.  Admittedly it could have done without the numerous scenes depicting someone getting kicked, punched, or whacked in the family jewels, but other than that I had no major qualms with it at all.  At times I laughed out loud, and I at least don't remember being bored at any point.  What astonishes me most about the reviews of this films is that everyone seems to be taking it seriously!  The same people who say that the plot is ridiculous probably loved movies like Star Wars and Pulp Fiction.  This movie didn't claim to be based in fact, and in fairness it can't be evaluated as such.  Like any fiction film, it requires some suspension of disbelief.  The dialogue isn't any worse than any of the action movies it so clearly mocks, and as for the acting, well, Peter MacNichol plays himself as usual (not a bad thing!), Christopher Lloyd turns in a appropriately cartoonish performance, and I was actually pretty impressed with the toddlers' physical acting, considering their age.So, in summary, this isn't a 10 out of 10 but it isn't bad.  You won't enjoy it if you take it too seriously, and you certainly won't enjoy it if you only look for its faults (which too many people seem to be doing).  I give it thumbs up!

What makes this movie so unique, both from Stone's earlier work and virtually every other American movie about the Vietnam War, is that Heaven and Earth is told from the perspective of a Vietnamese woman. This movie is based on two books of memoirs written by Le Ly Hayslip, a Vietnamese woman who grew up in a simple farming village in central Vietnam but whose life --- and those of most Vietnamese people, we can infer --- is turned upside-down by the madness of the Vietnam War.Strictly as a movie, this is a good but not great film.  Even at almost 2 1\/2 hours, the structure is a bit stilted in order to accommodate such an extensive story.  The first 30 minutes are mostly voice-overs and the movie doesn't pick up steam until later, when scenes are allowed to flow for extended amounts of time and we become caught in the drama.  Tommy Lee Jones gives another brutally realistic performance as a lifetime military man who can't leave the war behind.  Hiep Thi Ly is okay as Le Ly Hayslip; not Tommy Lee Jones caliber acting, but she competently plays a very difficult role. I read she was an amateur actress only chosen after an extensive casting call, and I'm glad that they decided to go with an actual young Vietnamese woman instead of choosing a generic asian actress.  It might not make a difference to most, but it certainly felt more real to me with an authentic Vietnamese-American in the main role.  Oliver Stone shows his mastery of mood and camerawork as he jumps from the beauty of the Vietnam countryside, to the ravages of war, to the shocking (for Le Ly) wealth of suburban America.  The movie occasionally drags but overall I'd still give it an 8 out of 10 because it's such a powerful and important addition to the cinematic depiction of the Vietnam War.The movie also inspired me to read the 2 books (When Heaven and Earth Changed Places and Child of War, Woman of Peace) it was based on. Stone had to compress many events in order to fit the run time; for example, the Tommy Lee Jones character is a fabrication based on 3 different men (and probably meshed into one man as much for the drama such an explosive character provides as for the time constraints), while her books spend extensive time on all 3 relationships.  However, the dialogue for several key scenes were taken almost word for word from her books, and I thought it captured the spirit of the story remarkably well, especially for a major studio movie.

It may not be the year's best picture, but it certainly ranks in the top ten, as far as I'm concerned.There has been much negativity associated with this film since its release -- many people felt that it wasn't a fitting swan song for Stanley Kubrick, one of the greatest filmmakers that ever lived; many also felt that there was too much hype and the film simply didn't live up to it; others were of the opinion that it was too slow and long. That reminds me of the people I saw who walked out of a David Lynch movie because it was too weird. It's David Freaking Lynch, what were you expecting? The guy doesn't make mainstream movies!The same can be said for the late great Kubrick. He had a style all his own, and this film has his fingerprints all over it  grainy, high contrast picture, bright primary colors, a chilling musical score, and an undercurrent of tension.The film has the style of a thriller, but it's more of a psychological drama. Cruise and Kidman are a husband and wife who live an upper-class Manhattan lifestyle (he's a prominent doctor). During a night of pot smoking, Kidman confesses that she was nearly unfaithful with a Naval officer she met the previous summer. This sends Cruise into a tailspin of jealousy and confusion, as he spends the next couple of nights exploring New York's seamy sexual underbelly. Among his exploits is an evening spent at an extremely creepy orgy which takes place in a mansion outside the city. This is the kind of film where you never know what's going to happen next, and that's where the film's true enjoyment lies. It's also great to see all of the traditional Kubrick elements in place.This is no Clockwork Orange, no 2001, but it's still an enormously entertaining film. For those people who are put off by the film's generally negative reviews, remember this almost all of Kubrick's films were initially panned. They seem to grow an appreciation over the years. I'm sure that in time, people will recognize EWS for what it is a masterpiece and a fitting final work in Kubrick's career.

It may not be the year's best picture, but it certainly ranks in the top ten, as far as I'm concerned.There has been much negativity associated with this film since its release -- many people felt that it wasn't a fitting swan song for Stanley Kubrick, one of the greatest filmmakers that ever lived; many also felt that there was too much hype and the film simply didn't live up to it; others were of the opinion that it was too slow and long. That reminds me of the people I saw who walked out of a David Lynch movie because it was too weird. It's David Freaking Lynch, what were you expecting? The guy doesn't make mainstream movies!The same can be said for the late great Kubrick. He had a style all his own, and this film has his fingerprints all over it  grainy, high contrast picture, bright primary colors, a chilling musical score, and an undercurrent of tension.The film has the style of a thriller, but it's more of a psychological drama. Cruise and Kidman are a husband and wife who live an upper-class Manhattan lifestyle (he's a prominent doctor). During a night of pot smoking, Kidman confesses that she was nearly unfaithful with a Naval officer she met the previous summer. This sends Cruise into a tailspin of jealousy and confusion, as he spends the next couple of nights exploring New York's seamy sexual underbelly. Among his exploits is an evening spent at an extremely creepy orgy which takes place in a mansion outside the city. This is the kind of film where you never know what's going to happen next, and that's where the film's true enjoyment lies. It's also great to see all of the traditional Kubrick elements in place.This is no Clockwork Orange, no 2001, but it's still an enormously entertaining film. For those people who are put off by the film's generally negative reviews, remember this almost all of Kubrick's films were initially panned. They seem to grow an appreciation over the years. I'm sure that in time, people will recognize EWS for what it is a masterpiece and a fitting final work in Kubrick's career.

A shame considering that a number of fine actors signed up for what doesn't hold a candle to any number of sci-fi TV show episodes.I have noticed many people comparing this to Armageddon, stating that it is no worse than that movie.  It was, however.  Much worse.Armageddon was no great film.  It was fluff, pure and simple.  There was nothing deep and meaningful about it.  What it was, though, was a great ride.  It didn't try to be anything other than entertaining.  I was stumped as to what the intent of Mission to Mars was.  It didn't encourage me to ponder the origins of our existence; the end of the movie supposedly answers all of those questions.  It didn't thrill me with the wonders of space travel.  And, sadly, it didn't entertain me.I am hardly a sophisticated moviegoer.  I am one of those people who looks at movies in the same way I look at art - if I like it, I like it.  Period.  I have never had this much difficulty in finding something positive to say about a movie, but I saw plenty of negatives- The dialogue was childish and tiresome.  Countless spoofs have been done of movie conversations in which one of the characters sets up a scene with a tidbit like Oh, Jim, you trained so hard for this.  If only your wife hadn't succumbed to a vile illness, and died, and you hadn't had to drop out of the program....   - What was with the score?  Music should enhance or complement a scene, not overpower it.  The use of music in this movie was one of it's biggest problems.- Better special effects wouldn't have been enough to save this movie, but it couldn't have hurt.  In many places the effects were just not that realistic.  I know, I'm being demanding, but with the technology available today, if you're going to use special effects, do it right.Alas, this one will grab a big chunk of everyone's money before it makes its way out of theatres.

I truly thought (from the previews) that it would be hilarious to see the juxtaposition of Meryl Streep's proper and glamorous character with Roseanne's crude and ugly lout.  Boy was I wrong.The first disappointment is that Streep and Roseanne appear in only two scenes together, disallowing the possibility of numerous odd-couple moments between the two women.  The second (and most glaring) disappointment is the unsatisfying story and unbelievable characters.  C'mon, Ed Begley Jr. as a philandering ladies' man?  And the underlying lesson I guess I was supposed to learn was that being manipulative and vindictive can gain you fame and fortune, and make you a better woman.  I felt that, in the final scene where Roseanne is walking down the street toward us, the director wanted all of us in the audience to be standing up and applauding this glorious and wonderful woman, along with all the great things she had done.  I didn't want to cheer for Roseanne, and I resented the implied manipulation of this scene.I would also have to agree with the above review (What Was Meryl Streep Thinking???) which pointed out the dreadful house-blowing-up incident. Even though it has been over 10 years since I've seen this film, that image is still burned into my mind, watching Roseanne walk away from a large-screen projection of a videotaped house explosion.Not only did this embarrassingly bad movie (considering the cast) make Siskel & Ebert's 10 Worst Movies Of The Year list, but it is the first title I call to mind whenever I am asked about the worst movies I've ever seen. Recommended only for the most dementedly obsessed Meryl Streep fans.
