And can you really blame the producers for making it this way?

Categorically set 200 years after the third, which was set possibly 200 years after the second, we get an action movie c.2299 with excessive gore and wisecracks. And that's really what dismayed me the first time. For while the movie never gets out of it's mainstream trough, the last twenty minutes scrape the barrel for tacky excess. Worst moment has to be the guy with an alien inside him who gets shot multiple times then bangs a man's face against a steel bar. With the man's head at waist level, he screams, and the camera pans down his throat to endoscopically reveal the alien. Then the alien rips through his ribcage, and in so doing tears through the face of the other man, all in blood-spattered detail. Or maybe you prefer the bit where the General picks his own brain out the back of his head, or the alien's guts getting sucked out of a g-force crack in slow motion. Just have a glance through this entry's quotes section. Nearly the entire list contains profanity or crude sexual references, clearly indicating the mentality of the piece.But away from the juvenile gore, the underwritten characters and the non-literary narrative, there are some good points. The aliens themselves are utilised better here than in the third, probably because the Rottweiler alien could never be played by a man in a suit. CGI is used, but sparingly. Still a little primitive, (note to CGI workers on soon-to-be-made Alien 5 the aliens are black, so why design them as silver?), but rarely used, it is passable. The aliens are shown to be intelligent, a throwback to the lift-operators of Aliens. Again, there is no horror, but that is because the creatures are perhaps over-familiar to audiences now. In fact, so docile are these aliens that this is the only film in the series with more than four survivors. The use of clones to bring back Ripley seems more of a logical plot extension than the gimmick it seemed first time around, and this does add an interesting slant to her hybrid character. Though once more, this doesn't really add to the dramatic tension, as the new, sexual Ripley, amazed she's alive again, doesn't care whether or not she lives.Ultimately, though, it comes down to who's your favourite Spice Girl? Scary? Action? Moody? Or Dumb Spice? They are the products of four very different writers and directors and do not gel together particularly well as a whole. Taken alone, Aliens is great entertainment. Watched concurrently with Alien, it's mindless slop. Yet while they're all entertaining, none of them, not even the first, have got above a 7 rating from me. For whatever you say about these four movies, they are just bug-eyed monster from outer space vehicles, the original no-brainers. Maybe that's why the fourth really disappoints.

The stinging box office failure of `Titan A.E.' this past summer has resulted in all the predictable head scratching, second guessing and blame-pointing that inevitably takes place among baffled and chagrined studio executives when a lavishly budgeted and massively promoted film fails to live up to commercial expectations.  Yet the reason for the film's lack of success seems almost painfully obvious.  Had `Titan A.E.' been made in 1976, for example, (or any year prior to the release of the original `Star Wars'), it might have seemed innovative and visionary.  One of the glories of animation has always been that it can often create visions and accomplish feats not possible in a live action format.  But when, as is the case of `Titan,' the imagery actually derives FROM non-animated works that have already successfully captured those visions on film, the overall effect is one not of innovation but of retrogression.  In other words, `Titan A. E.' seems to have strangely reversed the course animated and live action films normally follow.  As a result, the sci-fi special effects and the action stunt scenes in `Titan' look somehow cheap and tawdry in comparison to the real ones we have seen in countless movies that have come before it.  There is simply nothing in this film to excite an audience that has seen it all before &#150; and often in a considerably more impressive form than it is presented here.Yet, one could almost forgive the technical inadequacy if the film's characters and storyline were not so hackneyed and old fashioned.  Here we are supposed to be watching a tale taking place in the early 31st century, yet nothing about it seems fresh or forward looking.  The story seems mired in all the tired conventions of 1950's Marvel Comic books.  Thus, we have the usual nonsense about how Earth has been annihilated by a race of vicious aliens and how it is up to a cynical, cocky and whiny adolescent (voiced by Matt Damon) to single-handedly save the human race from virtual extinction.   Now the race is on as Bob, one step ahead of his pursuers, searches the universe for the futuristic Noah's Ark &#150; Titan A.E. - his late but obviously prescient father created to help carry on the planet should Earth just happen to someday suffer the inconvenience of being blown to smithereens.  Of course, no reluctant hero would be complete without a sassy, smart and beautiful female cohort (Drew Barrymore) to accompany him on his adventure.  Naturally, early on in their relationship, they engage in a seemingly non-stop barrage of mutual put-downs and insults &#150; that is, of course, until they fall in love and accept the romantic destiny to which they alone have hitherto remained oblivious.  Alas, the equally bland, cardboard villains of the piece also fail to register in any way whatsoever.  (Where is Darth Vader when you need him?)  Similarly ineffective are the obligatory low comic sidekicks that no animated film of any form or stripe can seem to do without.  It seems almost impossible to believe that it took no fewer than three adult screenwriters to concoct this truly witless screenplay.  Most egregious of all is that the film has been fitted with a completely anachronistic and inappropriate rock music soundtrack that shatters any illusion that we could actually be witnessing a story taking place more than one thousand years in the future.    Admittedly, `Titan A.E.' does boast a few effective action sequences and some mighty impressive artwork in the background.  What a shame that it is all essentially thrown away on yet another piece of under-cooked, warmed-over `Star Wars.'  Icons are icons for a reason and should rarely, if ever, be tampered with.

The stinging box office failure of `Titan A.E.' this past summer has resulted in all the predictable head scratching, second guessing and blame-pointing that inevitably takes place among baffled and chagrined studio executives when a lavishly budgeted and massively promoted film fails to live up to commercial expectations.  Yet the reason for the film's lack of success seems almost painfully obvious.  Had `Titan A.E.' been made in 1976, for example, (or any year prior to the release of the original `Star Wars'), it might have seemed innovative and visionary.  One of the glories of animation has always been that it can often create visions and accomplish feats not possible in a live action format.  But when, as is the case of `Titan,' the imagery actually derives FROM non-animated works that have already successfully captured those visions on film, the overall effect is one not of innovation but of retrogression.  In other words, `Titan A. E.' seems to have strangely reversed the course animated and live action films normally follow.  As a result, the sci-fi special effects and the action stunt scenes in `Titan' look somehow cheap and tawdry in comparison to the real ones we have seen in countless movies that have come before it.  There is simply nothing in this film to excite an audience that has seen it all before &#150; and often in a considerably more impressive form than it is presented here.Yet, one could almost forgive the technical inadequacy if the film's characters and storyline were not so hackneyed and old fashioned.  Here we are supposed to be watching a tale taking place in the early 31st century, yet nothing about it seems fresh or forward looking.  The story seems mired in all the tired conventions of 1950's Marvel Comic books.  Thus, we have the usual nonsense about how Earth has been annihilated by a race of vicious aliens and how it is up to a cynical, cocky and whiny adolescent (voiced by Matt Damon) to single-handedly save the human race from virtual extinction.

But although the films lost quality with each sequel, they continued to get more and more popular at the box-office. After Rocky III raked in over $120 million, there would be no doubt that Stallone would churn out another installment of the Philadelphia pugilist. Using his huge success with Rambo First Blood Part II the same year as a spring board, he gives us Rocky IV, undoubtedly one of the worst films of the 1980s (right down there with the Rambo series).After Rocky defeats Clubber Lang (Mr. T) and regains the heavyweight title, a new boxer arrives. He is Ivan Drago (Dolph Lundgren), a cold, steel-like man who has been trained to perfection by the Soviet sports machine. Rocky's cocky friend Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) thinks he can take Drago in an exhibition match but the Russian's power goes on full display when Creed dies in the ring. Fueled by hate and the need for revenge, Rocky agrees to fight the unbeatable Drago in Moscow, where the world awaits a climatic showdown of east-versus-west.If the Cold War ever turned hot, Russian POWs would be herded into theatres to see Rocky IV ten times a day. The movie is so blantantly stupid and hyper-patriotic, stone-cold Drago seems like the only sane one. Of course, while Rocky pulls logs and climbs mountains, Drago is being trained in high-tech gyms and being pumped up with steroids. His wife Ludmilla (Brigette Nielsen) seems nice and caring to the outside world, but inside she craves destruction just like her husband. Drago's trainer screams about how corrupt and backwards the culture of the United States is. He is right corrupt, stupid, and offensive enough to release Rocky IV.Stallone has no right to comment on situations he obviously knows nothing about. Making Communists the enemy is simply a way to lock a high-profit for the film. Rambo had the same pathetic political outlook that America is the great country fighting against the evil empire that Ronal Reagan envisioned. Stallone is just as stupid as Reagan and takes pride in scenes where Rocky, the uneducated but lovable boxer from Philadelphia, wraps himself in the American flag and then gives a speech to the Moscow crowd, who cheer him on!If you can put all this behind you, you can still see that the intangibles of the movie are pretty bad. Adrian and Paulie's characters become more and more useless as the films continue this time Adrian only covers her face when Rocky is losing and Paulie simply talks with a life-size robot he gets for his birthday (!). Stallone himself has obviously overtaken his Rocky persona and is throughly stupid. As usual, Carl Weathers is the only bright spot in the production.When it does come time for Rocky to face Drago in the ring, we don't see the underdog that just barely managed to stay up to win in Rocky II or the guy who went the distance with the heavyweight champ in Rocky. Now, Balboa is a huge, ripped machine who has no strategy but to pummell his enemy to death with non-stop hits. The fight is so cartoonish, completly with Drago giving Rocky the death-stare, it feels like video game propaganda.Rocky IV is completly unlike anything seen in the first movie. How much our hero has changed! At first, he was a tough boxer with a will to win against all odds. Now, he is an oversize poster boy for the US, preaching against the Soviet EVIL.

In fact, and no one has mentioned this, most of the visual effects, props, and extra production were DONATED for this film. When was the last time you heard of that? Yes the traps are less than mind blowing at times, but that is not the point. They are a device for the plot, to focus on them is to miss the entire point of what the film is about.Yes, some of the performances are less than stellar. But nothing worse than what Costner typically turns in, and his salary is several times the entire budget of this film, so get over it. Most of these actors are in their early twenties (as is the most of the crew) and still learning their craft. Get past it. The filmmakers made a conscious decision to paint the characters as stereotypes initially, and then turn those stereotypes 180 degrees. They were not entirely successful in realizing this development, but they admit that themselves in the DVD commentary.

You try realizing such an original concept on almost no budget, filming in confined spaces with an inexperience cast and crew and do the whole production in 20 days.

In the commentary, the filmmakers are clear that their intent was to give the viewer the idea of the solution, but not to get bogged down in mathematical details.

It is not a great film, but it is thought-provoking and a welcome respite from the let's send a bunch of Texans into space to blow a meteorite tripe that passes for science fiction film these days.And, if I've offended any of the intellectually challenged amongst you, well you probably don't know it anyway.dr. beat ","genre":"Mystery, Sci-Fi, Thriller"},{"date":"26 November 2000","score":"9 out of 16 people found the following review useful","review":"  I can find something to like in almost any film.

I like Pierce Brosnan's Bond. He's been able to finally get rid of the whole invincible superman motif that has plagued the franchise since Moonraker while preserving Bond's mystique. Instead of trying to top Connery and Moore, he's able to marry both their strengths with his own style. Though I have long thought that the producers should let John Woo and other Hong Kong directors take a crack at the franchise, dramatic director\/photographer Michael Apted does a surprisingly good job here. In addition to being abld to bring out the best in his actors, Apted's background in photography comes in handy during the action scenes, making up for his lack of experience in the genre. The film also has a great score, too. If we can't have John Barry back, then David Arnold, who also scored Tomorrow Never Dies, is the next best thing. The film also benefits by the casting of Robert Carlyle as the villain Renard. Instead of the pun-spewing lunatic we would likely get in a non-Bond actioner, Carlyle channels cinema's greatest madman Colonel Kurtz from Apocalypse Now. There are visual similarities between Renard and Kurtz as well, though Carlyle is obviously a lot slimmer. And the early scene that gives us background info on Renard is remiscient of the briefing on Kurtz at the beginning of AN. As for the women, Sophie Marceau is wonderful as Elektra King. She is able to do something most of us wish we could do, she takes whatever she wants and does it in a way so that people think she's a real nice person. Alot of people have complained about Denise Richards, but she does fine here considering that she had two roles to fill not only was she the good girl, but she also had to take the position filled by Jack Wade in the two previous films. However, when they called her Dr. Jones I couldn't help but think of Bond's famous stateside counterpart. Tomb Raider fans will notice the outfit she wears at the nuclear facility is very Lara Croft, who by the way would be an ass kicking Bond girl. Lastly, this film makes a great encomium to Desmond Llwelyn, who tragically died in an auto accident weeks after this release.All in all, Pierce Brosan's best Bond film, at least until John Woo directs him.

I think this is a great mistake. Dracula and Frankenstein are very famous films, but neither are great as films. Bride of Frankenstein is a great film, but it is maybe not as artistically well made as some people would like to think. The Wolf Man is, however, a masterfully made film. Unlike the many later installments of Universal's horror franchise, The Wolf Man aspires to be more than just another movie to consume and then forget ten minutes later. It is a very complex and literate film, and deserves a greater reputation than it has. There are plenty of one dimensional supporting characters in this film. The love interest is not a great actress, and her character is quite slim in character. The gypsy woman who appears once in a while is just a gross stereotype, and is not very interesting (she works more like a normal plot device). And the police could have been lifted from any other film. But there are a few great performances in this film. Claude Raines is excellent as the father. Bela Lagosi, who of course played Dracula a decade before The Wolf Man, proves that he is a versatile actor. He is only in the film for a few moments, but his character is developed psychologically. And then we have Lon Chaney Jr. I have heard him called a block of wood before. I don't know if people who claim that have seen this film. He really does create a very complex character.

Chaney Jr. is not handsome at all. And he is not smooth or charming. He seems like a perpetual loser. Heck, he meets up with the love interest because he saw through her window with a telescope! This works perfectly for this film, and it turns out to be a very nearly perfect movie. The only fault is that it may end too abruptly, although the ending does not give us closure.

What they're giving us is a world thatis dying, and not only dying, but actually killing itself.  What they wantus to understand is the pathetic spectacle this all presents.  Everything that most humans take for granted in life--food, comfort, shelter,intimacy--is dying.  In fact, the human organism itself is dying.  What we're shown is a dying planet Earth.  What makes it all the morepathetic is that outside of the enlightened few (who can do nothingto stop the process anyhow) none of the characters is aware of whatis really happening to them.  They are poor dumb beasts.  Lambsled to slaughter, moths to the flame.  Out, brief candle!  The sentiment is the same, as each character leads her or his pitiable andinsignificant existence.  On this level, then, this film is brilliant.  It is a panoramic view of adecaying planet throughout.  If you feel anything at all for MotherEarth, then something inside you dies when you realize that sheis indeed dying.

Now this movie, isn't a part of that new wave (see The Scream Trilogy for that) but it is included in the more generic music-video descendents. Like many movies these days, the action is paused for a musical break including avant-gard artistic expressions, and this movie has an excellent action-pause sequence. It also has some good quotes, though not coherently and certainly not during its entire length, excellent artistic direction and visual effects, and its cinematography matches its visual excellency. But the screenplay almost pushes this movie into commercial horror (see The Haunting - 1999), because of its undeveloped characters and the incarnation of evil chosen here.Sometimes, like in the initial sequence, it's scary as hell, and can be considered very brave for a studio to pull out such a violent an gory movie, but disappointingly, in the rest, it's all too predictable, or even, not scary at all. Final comment Great art mixed with somewhat ordinary gore.

In this case the game consists in doing everything to make the viewer identify him\/herself in Selma's character; so He shows her as the most harmless, excessively generous and implausibly naïve person in the world a sort of a child-woman who hides her money in a cookies-box, someone which is impossible not to have sympathy for. Then He subjects Selma to a contrived series of physical and psychological tortures which, because of the identification process between character and viewer, is inflicted to the audience too. This way the director achieves his only aim have the viewers crying after taking them on the verge of a nervous breakdown. One of the negative notes of this movie is the balance of characters after Breaking the Waves Lars von Trier has been accused of misogyny and knowing that also The Dancer could be liable of the same remark, because of the very similar childish, tormented female main character, He surrounded Selma with a series of male characters who are almost all nasty and negative and He interspersed the script, especially toward the finale, with a lot of references to sorority and female bonding. For these reasons I invite IMDb commentators who claimed this film as a masterpiece to reconsider their judgment and think about it with more detachment in fact the director's seemingly succeeded attempt was to talk only to viewer's heart cutting out the brain. Finally two requests don't take The Dancer as film against death penalty and the American way of life because those issues here are merely functional to the heroine's martyrdom; but above all don't ever compare Lars von Trier to C.T. Dreyer They don't have anything in common but the fact that They're both Danes and The Dancer resembles more to Arthur Hiller's Love Story than to The Passion of Joan of Arc.
