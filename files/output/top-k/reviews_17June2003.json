[{"date":"17 June 2003","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  Shrek is truly a gem in the standards of animation, which it truly deserved any award that it received, especially the Oscar for Best Animated Feature. Why? Well, it was just the best-animated film of that year!A truly unique adaptation to a children's picture book, where in the book Horribly hideous Shrek leaves home and terrifies everyone he encounters in his search for his equally ugly bride. While the feature film makes this somewhat simple children's story into a hilarious anti-Disney animated comedy! Now, according to the film, our title character (voiced brilliantly by Mike Myers) is an agreeable enough ogre who wants to live his days in peace. When the diminutive Lord Farquaad (voiced by John Lithgow) evicts local fairy tale creatures (including the now-famous Seven Dwarfs, Pinocchio and the Gingerbread Man), they settle in the ogre's swamp and Shrek wants answers from Farquaad. A quest of sorts starts for Shrek and his new pal, a talking donkey (played brilliantly by the incredible comedian Eddie Murphy), where battles have to be won and a princess (Cameron Diaz) must be rescued from a dragon lair in a thrilling action sequence! This plot is the kind of entertainment that certainly made the film the beloved classic that it is today! This is definitely suitable for anyone that hates Disney films (so I will like it as I cannot stand their over-rated pieces of work) as this spoofs most of their films, from Pinocchio all the way to Mulan, was ironically Murphy was involved! However, I disagree that it spoofs Pixar, except spoofing the good A Bug's Life. But, to be honest I find Pixar branded Disney, just because this conglomerate presents their work is a bit pointless, as all the work of Pixar is ten times better then the stuff Disney spew out to the public throughout the years. But I do not just make a contrast to Pixar films because that it is done wonderfully in computer animation, or that one of its films, Monster's Inc., was up for that Oscar too, but because it possesses the qualities that make Pixar films excellent. First of all the humour, visually and verbally, great music, by earning Bafta, Saturn, and Grammy nominations to prove it, and family appeal, colourful characters for the kids and interesting humour and spoofs of action films for the adults!So what I can I say to conclude my review. Great Voices provided by a brilliant cast to one of the best films to be based on a children's book! In addition, with many Annies for its impressive animation, this film has plenty of awards to prove its brilliance! Overall, definitely an anti-Disney film but has the same humble qualities to any Pixar film!
