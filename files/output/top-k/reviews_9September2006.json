I really like the way he uses color, says Jack of a Monet on board.Rose and Jack's second scene will make you cringe on so many levels the more times you see it. The 17-year-old Rose, spoiled, depressed, and well-schooled in Freud, takes a gratuitous interest in Jack's sketchbook, then unexpectedly decides in the course of a few seconds that he's really some artist. You'd think in a 200+ minute move they could take a little more time with this bit, which is a turning point in their relationship. It's too bad that Cameron doesn't seem to think it matters whether anything that happens with the characters makes sense.But in the end, the characters aren't really what matters in terms of whether the movie works, at least for me. Silly as Jack and Rose's story is, it does move the action along. Neither DiCaprio nor Winslett look right for their parts (no getting around her looking at least 5 years older than him), but the actors provide enough spark to distract you from the movie's many flaws, at least for the first viewing or two.And the fact is, I didn't mind the the 200+ minutes at all when I saw it in the theater. (Contrast this with the vastly overpraised Return of the Kings, the last 20-30 minutes of which might have been the most excruciating experience of my movie-going life.) I'm sure there are flaws in the cinematography I didn't notice, but that combined with the score drew me into the experience and feel of being on the great ship at that point in history. I generally don't care for special effects, but there's no denying that those in Titanic '97 are integral to the action.As a three-year-old my son sat through the whole thing. Could be that makes the point for the people who hate Cameron's Titanic, but I sat through it too. I think Gloria Stewart deserved her Oscar.

There's no getting around that even with his limitations, Cameron does care about the story of the Titanic, and the story, if not the characters, is well served by Cameron's strengths.

It is shown at the opening of the film to have smashed one automaker's hand with it's hood while suffocating another with carbon monoxide. So we know what Arnie doesn't..that this car whose name is Christine isn't your ordinary Plymoth. Something deep within this car is evil and it grips a demonic hold on whoever drives it. Dennis(John Stockwell), a star football player, tries to warn his best friend to not buy this hunk of junk, but Arnie can not resist it's pull. Arnie's parents do not approve of buying it and his resistance towards them begins here. Arnie is shown as sweet and self-deprecating. He is mistreated by three bullies in machine shop, and the leader plans to assault Arnie, and Dennis who takes up for him with a switchblade knife. They take their anger out on Arnie when he and Dennis report them to the autoshop teacher, by destroying Christine..that will be quite a mistake! The film's main conflict, however, is Leigh(Alexandra Paul)..a hottie who becomes Arnie's love interest. She is truthfully Christine's main nemesis other than the thrill bullies for she comes between the car and Arnie. You see, anyone who comes between Christine and her man must be punished.I believe Christine gets better every time I watch it. Now, I know the story and\/or idea of a car with demonic powers(..not to mention her hold on whoever is the rightful owner)might be regarded as silly, but there's something so compelling about it. I guess what comes out the creepiest is Keith Gordon's transformation as the film continues. He's so self-deprecating and timid, we love him at the beginning which makes what Christine does to him even more tragic. We watch as he begins to resist his parents(using foul language towards them in defiance;even attack his father), turns away from possible love with Leighwho deeply cares about him, barking at those who wish to insult his lady, growing apart from Dennis, and seeing this evil slowly overcome him. We truthfully see what Christine does to those who become hers. The film also shows that she can repair herself after serious damage is inflicted on her. When the gang of bullies smash her to smithereens, Arnie ..by this time almost completely psychopathicgives her the extra push to reshape her torso so that they could seek revenge towards those who hurt her.Despite it's reputation, the film isn't graphic for Carpenter wishes to ratchet up the suspense instead of bloodying the screen. We watch as Christine chases down each of the three who caused her and Arnie harm and the car's wrath brings on an investigation directed toward Arnie. That detective is played by Harry Dead Stanton.Dennis and Leigh(who both have now realized how evil Christine is thanks to Leigh's near choking death thanks to the evil car)must try and save Arnie before the car destroys him. But, can Arnie be saved? Ultimately, the film is about obsession. Arnie becomes obsessed with Christine and vice versa. But, perhaps Christine finds certain suitors who are weak and need affirmation from someone when life deals them a bad deck. Certainly in Arnie's case, Christine awakens something sinister, though at first he simply gains courage by asking out Leigh and facing overbearing parents.

It of course is not the sort of movie that makes you laugh out loud but it's the sort of movie that amuses you throughout its entire running time. I like to compare this movie and its style a bit to the Stanley Kubrick movie Barry Lyndon.The movie has a simple story, set in the late 18th century France, about two rich and above all bored aristocrats who take pleasure in hurting other persons, out of the high circles of society, feelings and setting persons up against each other. They do this mostly by seduction which provides this movie with a most of the time overly present atmosphere of sexual tension and eroticism. The story isn't that complicated but it is made out to look complicated by the unusual and unpredictable characters and the typical old fashioned dialog. It takes a good storyteller to still tell a story like this, amusing and likable enough but above all also understandable enough. Luckilly director Stephen Frears is a more than good storyteller. It makes Dangerous Liaisons an original and always amusing movie to watch over and over again. That's also why I think that this movie should have won an Oscar for best directing rather than for best adapted screenplay. Strangely enough the movie was nominated for best movie but not even for best director. Stephen Frears personally deserved some more credit for this movie.The movie is extremely well cast and all of the actors deliver a fine and effective performance. All of the actors deliver the difficult dialog in a fine- but above all, believable way. Actors that really stand out in this movie are Glenn Close, who also received an Oscar nomination and John Malkovich who plays his character exactly the right way; Dry, convincing as a good kind-heated person who falls truly in love but above all also as a cold-hearted brute, who enjoys hurting other persons feelings but not cold-hearted enough to make us completely hate him, or not care about his character's faith. He plays his character exactly right but it of course is also thanks to Stephen Frears that his character works out the way he does. It's mainly thanks to Malkovich's character, since he is the character that mostly carries the movie, that the movie and its story work out so well. Also really great and impressive in her role was the then still teenager Uma Thurman, in one of her earliest and perhaps also heaviest roles. She also looks truly beautiful in her role and I'm not only saying this because of her 'nude' scene in this movie. Other well known actors in this movie are Michelle Pfeiffer, who also got nominated for an Oscar and Keanu Reeves, from the period when he still mostly starred in comedies. He wasn't too impressive in this movie but it still was sort of fun to see him in a role and movie like this.Besides the acting the most powerful and effective element of the movie is its visual look. The movie is visually a delight, with some impressive looking costumes (also an Oscar win for that.) and some marvelous cinematography. This and also most of its other visual elements, certainly help to make the story and characters work out as good as they did.I don't really see this movie as a classic (yet) or an essential must-see. It's not quite impressive or provoking enough for that but it comes really close. Visually this movie is definitely perfect though. When you watch this movie you'll definitely won't regret it.9\/10http\/\/bobafett1138.blogspot.com\/ ","genre":null},{"date":"9 September 2006","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Although this movie is always everywhere credited as a drama\/romance, I regarded this movie as an highly amusing 'dark' comedy, with subtle humor and characters.

He wasn't too impressive in this movie but it still was sort of fun to see him in a role and movie like this.Besides the acting the most powerful and effective element of the movie is its visual look. The movie is visually a delight, with some impressive looking costumes (also an Oscar win for that.) and some marvelous cinematography. This and also most of its other visual elements, certainly help to make the story and characters work out as good as they did.I don't really see this movie as a classic (yet) or an essential must-see. It's not quite impressive or provoking enough for that but it comes really close. Visually this movie is definitely perfect though. When you watch this movie you'll definitely won't regret it.9\/10http\/\/bobafett1138.blogspot.com\/ ","genre":"Drama, Romance"},{"date":"9 September 2006","score":"6 out of 9 people found the following review useful","review":" After reading a few of the comments, I am disappointed that some people just did not understand this movie.

The two leads are falling in love with each other, madly yet cautiously, but the two leads also have other loves. They each are still in love with their deceased spouses, who died too suddenly and at such young ages. Each lead is also in love with their children, around whom they build their worlds, and act as both mother and father--they are both single parents. The way the grieving process is treated in this movie is realistic and heartwarming. And both children are adorable, their scenes being natural and just plain cute. The children are interesting elements in the movie. They are both links to the past (links to the deceased spouses) and also the reason the two leads met.I have never seen more beautiful scenes than when Jean-Louis is driving his Mustang on the beach (Deauville, I think), when they are hanging out at the shore watching an old man and his dog, and when they go on a date and take the kids. The date with the kids is such a real scene, the dialogue being both meaningless and meaningful, as it's the WAY they speak to each other that is the interesting thing in that scene. That is why a lot of it is silent--it is beautiful how Jean-Louis grips Anne's chair, as if he cannot be close enough to her. Also, when Anne remembers life with her husband--in Brazil, with him singing a Samba and them riding horses--yes, it may be a bit overly romantic for some people, but it is beautiful nonetheless.I also have to say that the theme music is very pretty, classic, and has stood the test of time.

By this film history is completely gone as is any relation to Dumas' book other than the characters. This film is based on the concept of aging musketeers. It is a funny concept, but just doesn't carry a film. The same gag, guys who can't do it anymore, gets old pretty quickly, and it then it just isn't fun to watch. There is a reliance on things like dwarfs being funny to look at, and elaborately silly hidden panels and such, funny costumes, and Mel Brook-ish humour and funny accents in very poor rhythm with the plot line. The move between gags and the plot is just plain jarring. It is intended as a parody of the first two films--a lovely idea in concept--but it would work as a 15 minute skit, not a feature.Part of why it worked was the quality of the stars with the three central characters (not in order of billing) (of the film) D'Artagnon, Cardinal Richelieu, and Lady De Winter being played by Michael York, Charleton Heston and Faye Dunaway. Chareleton Heston and Fay Dunaway do not return to this film and they are very missed. Kim Catrell plays the Faye Dunaway role (as her daughter) and lovely though she is, she just is not close to the actress that Dunaway was. Dunaway managed to be really be scary and sexy (Think Vagina Dentata as a surprise to a lover kind of feeling). And Heston, crazy gun coot that he was then, was pretty scary in a fun way too. The actor in his role just is not very convincingly malevolent. Also missing from this cast is Raquel Welch, playing the dumb, funny gorgeous sexpot (against Dunaway's scary, super-intelligent sociopathic sexpot).Given the quality of the original two films, and how mediocre the script for this is, I am surprised the rest of the major players returned Christopher Lee (great in all), Oliver Reed (playing a drunk--big surprise), Geraldine Chaplin (her role is larger and Much more poorly written--she is not a comedienne), and Richard Chamberlain. All wonderful actors but poorly used in this film.There is a young love interest couple OK I've mentioned it exists.Finally, Michael York was rivetingly sexy in the first two films. In 1974 he was 32 and played an 18 year old quite convincingly. In 1989 he was 47 playing a 47 year old who appeared to be 30. He was still fun to watch, but I think he kind of dumbed-down his physical grace, where as the other musketeer actors clearly couldn't run (ya know in real life) couldn't run more than four or five steps. Oliver Reed and Richard Chamberlin did still sizzle a bit in 1974 but by 1989--nada in the sexy pants division for these two. Like Chaplain, comedy is not their forte. This has no credible dramatic elements. They are not enjoyable to look at, so it doesn't leave lots for them to add.Oh yeah, don't confuse this with the Disney Three Muskateers film made in the 90's. It is almost unwatchable.--I noticed from someone else's review that an actor known in the UK for physical comedy actually was killed doing a horse stunt, and that partly accounts for folks in the UK likely this film more than folks in the US. It always seems awful when you read someone dies making a film doing a stunt. It is especially dreadful when the film comes out to be mediocre like this one.I gave this a five, meaning fair.

But I didn't like this one.What makes this movie different from other movies of this genre, is that our main character Greg Focker isn't the typical stupid guy with a good heart that we see in comedies of this sort. Instead, Greg is a real jerk, who takes every chance he can to do something nasty. He displays himself as a coward and a liar -- a rather spine-less person. Incidentally, he is revealed to be Jewish, and perhaps one could say that he fits a stereotypical Jewish movie depiction whining and full of self-pity.However, there were actually some surprisingly comical moments in the movie that made me laugh out loud.

This earlier film of theirs really kicks off what was to be an eventful 1990s for the Brothers Coen.A career criminal and his ex-cop wife kidnap a baby fro ma rich man, not for ransom... but to raise it as their own. The plot thickens when two old prison buddies of the main character break out and need somewhere to stay.What I really enjoyed was the variety of Raimi shots, especially the really long zoom-in one. One of the Coens (I forget which) was involved in Evil Dead, so the Coen-Raimi connection runs deep. (Future films, like Hudsucker Proxy, have the collaborating.... and cross-references happen on occasion, even in this film where Crime Wave is referenced. The grocery store scene even had some similar aspects that Intruder had.) Nicolas Cage is the star of this film (along with the lesser-known Holly Hunter and John Goodman). Cage is like Elvis. Some like the thin Elvis, some like the fat Elvis. There is a younger and an older Cage. This one is the younger (seen also in Trapped in Paradise). While I enjoyed his performance in this movie, he seemed to still be a weak and uncomfortable actor. I prefer the older Cage (Adapatation, Lord of War, Weather Man).But by far the greatest character in this film was the biker of the apocalypse. At first only a brief dream, his role becomes bigger and bigger as the film goes on until he becomes more central to the plot. I don't know how to describe him other than to say he is literally Hell on Wheels and a force to be reckoned with.The down side? Besides being a less tight Coen Brothers film, and a weak Nicolas Cage, the only thing I can really say against this movie is something about the painted backgrounds. I found the scenery to be really fake. But, heck, maybe that was on purpose.Watch The Big Lebowski, Hudsucker Proxy and Fargo first... but then come back for this Coen classic.

So, I suppose, one could say it's a pointless movie.Except.Each scene was really wonderful - I was pulled into each conversation (or wacky interaction, in the case of Catherine Keener's character) so thoroughly that I felt I understood each character as if they were a colleague or neighbor.

This movie is what a western should be like. I would almost go as far as to say that this is the best American western ever made along with the wild bunch, the man who shot liberty valence and unforgiven. All though this movie is just a tad better by my opinion, because this is not a traditional western with lots of action and gun fire. This is more realistic in a way. It's much easier to identify with the characters in this western than with all the other traditional westerns because it gives a more realistic view. I really liked the way this movie was shot, I'm a big fan of black and white, but there was something special about this movie. It didn't give me that high production feeling, not that I don't like high production black and white pictures, but I think it was necessary for this movie to emphasize the realism of the movie.The Cast is great as well. Gary Cooper, which I personally haven't seen much of yet, does a spectacular job, well worth an Oscar. At the end when he is all alone you can see how afraid he is and that he really doesn't want to die. This is one of the things that makes this movie so great, the hero isn't afraid to show his feelings. Grace Kelly, which in my opinion is one of the most beautiful creature that ever walked this earth, does a fine job as well. And Lloyd Bridges is good too. The fact that it is directed by an Austrian was a bit of a shock to me, but that goes to show that western isn't really best when Americans make it. In my opinion Fred Zinnermann and Sergio Leone has made the best westerns ever, and none of them are Americans.This really is one of the best westerns out there. It can almost compare to The good the bad and the ugly and Once upon a time in the west. It probably is the best American western ever made at least. But all in all a fantastic movie.

It was a very funny scene to see them dutifully playing their instruments while a steam bath is ongoing for Frank! I like Maurice Chevalier in this film as it gives him more space for character development and not just a bland light type with little depth as in most of his other roles. He's the detective father of young Ariane who plays the cello, and he avoids talking to her about his work which is supposed to be secretive anyways and in this case it involves spying on a wayward wife - so what else is new in Paris? As the story unfolds, Ariane meets and falls for Frank, then endeavours to get some serious attention and commitment from carefree Frank who probably doesn't know the meaning of commitment, but she tries by using a rather indirect ploy and eventually finds he can get jealous of her fabricated other loves in her life while he's away - a ruse she uses to good effect.I suppose you might say Gary Cooper was rather too old for this role as he lacks a certain spontaneity for such light comedy but I'm happy with his presence nonetheless. Don't laugh, but I can just picture Bob Hope playing this role to the hilt, of being a lady's man, such as he's done in so many movies of the past.

Very contrived flick as former FBI agent, James Spader tracks down serial killer, Keanu Reeves who has a slight obsession with Spader and a serious obsession with killing women with piano wire. Spader is of course, plagued by nightmares from his past and Marissa Tomei is the psychologist trying to help him.The good points of this movie Spader, Spader, Spader. He is great in this role and his I don't give a **** attitude will charm you. An underrated actor, much in the same fit as William Petersen, he needs that big role to give him star power. There are also some really genuine scenes between him and Tomei, and Spader's candidness gives the scenes depth.Also, I don't know how the director gained so much star power for such a low budget movie. James Spader, Marissa Tomei, Keanu Reeves, Ernie Hudson... not bad. It certainly doesn't hurt the movie. And there is a great chase scene...Drawbacks very, very contrived. Plays like a made for TV movie. Some of the actors are very wooden in their supporting roles. Also, the direction relies on some out of place, slow motion and strange camera tricks to try and give the movie some flare. The movie would have benefited from some plain, gritty camera-work that matched the subject matter. This isn't Miami Vice or a John Woo flick.Neutrals Keanu Reeves. If Reeves had have changed his appearance as he did to play the bullying husband in The Gift, it would have added a whole lot more to this flick. Instead, I couldn't see past his surfer image. He's not bad in this role, but it could have been so much more.As a whole, this movie could have been great but was ruined by shoddy direction and a low budget feel. You get the feeling it was pushed out there with the star power to draw audiences instead of the movie itself. Still, a little disappointing when you realize, with a little passion and more creativity, this movie could have been great. Still, there are worse ways to spend an hour and a half.

Herman, Brian Schwary, Thomas Hartman, Trevor Ristow, Randy Pearlstein, Stacie Sumter, Jill Tara Kushner, Jimmy Baio, Thomas Saccio, Emma Fann, Mike Hodge, Anne O'Sullivan, Laura Bailey, William Cain, Rudy Ruggiero, Adam LaFevre, Carlo Scibelli.....Director Barbara Streissand, Screenplay Richard LaGravanesse. I want to be upfront with you. I am not interested in sex. When my date takes me home and kisses me good night, if I don't hear the philharmonic in my head, I dump him. Directed and produced by Barbara Streissand herself, this 1996 film is actually a re-make of a 1958 French film Le Miroir a Deux Faces, but altered to fit into New York City in the 1990's. Barbara Streissand's signature is all over this, much like it was in the 1991 film Prince of Tides where she was paired with Nick Nolte. Here she is paired with handsome and talented actor Jeff Bridges and their chemistry is remarkably good. Several aspects of this film make it truly great, even though it was not a very successful film when it was released, despite a star cast - Pierce Brosnan, Mimi Rogers and most notably, Lauren Bacall, who won the Oscar for Supporting Actress. Babs plays Rose Morgan, a plain, intellectual Columbia University English professor. She has been married once- to self-absorbed and successful Alex (Pierce Brosnan) who, tired of her strong feminist attitudes and disinterest in her looks, dumps her for the more attractive and exciting Claire (Mimi Rogers).After answering an ad, she finds herself drawn to Professor Gregory Larkin (Jeff Bridges)who has himself been in an unsuccessful marriage. Both of them know that marriage is a risky venture and they both consent to marry with the condition that sexual and physical love will not be part of the equation. With this premise, Streissand explores the age-old issues of male and female conflicts, women's sexuality, women's empowerment and the human fascination with romance. We're all suckers for a great romance set to romantic music like Puccini's operas she says. While she tries to escape this, she and Gregory find fulfilling this condition difficult. Inevitably, they consummate their relationship with sex, but they have fallen for each other's souls and deeper selves before they were ever drawn to each other's sensuality. Lauren Bacall got the Oscar for Supporting Actress in her role as Rose's mother. She is a social-climbing and materialistic woman who does not genuinely care for her daughter's happiness. Rose rebels against her mother by opting not to look attractive and to stroke a man's ego but to find happiness on her own terms and to support herself financially. The chemistry between Lauren Bacall and Barbara Streissand, two famous women at this time, is superb. Jeff Bridges, an actor who could take on roles as different as night and day, plays Professor Gregory Larkin with nuance, human warmth and wit, which matches Barbara Streissand's strong-willed and sharp-witted Rose perfectly. A sexy nerd, he attempts to find happiness with a woman through a strictly platonic relationship but eventually discovers that the appeal of sex and romance is too strong. This is an intelligently written film, with comedic flair a ala Woody Allen. It's a delightful film about relationships, about inner beauty and about self-discovery. It's about the irresistible appeal of romance, which we are fed to by romantic movies and fairy tales. With superb music, including an Oscar winning original song, great cinematography and feel-good quality, this is one of my favorite romantic comedies to come from the mid 1990's. It stands out because it's so intelligently expressed. Other great romantic comedies of the 90's with a feminist slant include The First Wive's Club. Fans of Barbara Streissand will enjoy this high-caliber film, with many wonderful moments. Two thumbs up.

A stunning thriller filmed almost entirely underwater and one of the first films to feature CGI effects. But it's not the special effects that define this film. It's the plot, the script, the characters, and the direction.The Abyss begins with a US Nuclear Submarine encountering an anomaly in the ocean, causing them to crash into a trench at the bottom of the ocean. The US Navy is powerless to reach them because of an incoming Hurricane. So instead they hire a group of underwater oil miners led by Virgil 'Bud' Brigman. Brigman's soon-to-be-ex-wife, Lindsay, infuriated that her underwater oil rig is being used for a military operation, tags along with a group of Navy SEALS led by the cold Lieutenant Coffey. As they investigate the Sub wreckage, the Divers and the SEALS encounter a power living down in the Abyss...A power with the ability to save the world or destroy it.James Cameron outdoes himself with this underwater thriller and so does the cast. You get inside each of the characters heads and see each their points of view. Ed Harris plays his role quietly and coolly, playing a man who's become bitter from losing his wife and questioning whether there is life at the bottom of the ocean. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio is awesome as Lindsay Brigman, a dedicated engineer and scientist determined to prove that the life at the bottom of the Abyss is not a threat to mankind. Michael Biehn steals the show, though, as the slowly-going-insane Lieutenant Coffey. Not since watching Platoon have I seen such insanity in a man. Gone is the cool charming character of Kyle Reese and instead is a man who will kill anything that threatens his mission.Point blank Watch this film.Signed, The Constant DVD Collector, Matt MacleodParental Warning There's some mild swearing and tense moments, but there's also a scene of nudity as well.

If you're a fan of Dickens' writing, you'll like the way that much of the dialogue is lifted from his original novel and yet can still be understood by the audience, whatever their age. (Of course, Rizzo's literary observations don't hurt, either.) If you're into costumes you'll appreciate that the present cast are dressed in the typical 1840s Dickensian wardrobe, whereas in the Ghost of Christmas Past segment, the boy Scrooge wears Georgian clothing and the young man (who looks uncannily like a younger Michael Caine) dresses in Regency attire. And pretty much everybody can appreciate those wonderful Muppets.Although the tale of Ebeneezer Scrooge is well known as a simple Christmas parable, it's clear just how much work went into making this film really work - using Fozzie Bear as Fozziwig, for instance. I wonder if that's why the Hensons decided to make this particular story in the Muppet style. In the school scenes, the walls are covered in busts of Aristotle, Shakespeare and others, all made to look like Muppets. The fake snow looks better and adds more Christmas atmosphere than real snow ever could, and I like the darkness of Scrooge's office - if he was too mean to provide lighting, it would have looked like that.I do like the interaction between Gonzo and Rizzo - Should we be worried about the kids in the audience?, No, this is culture - and the way they retreat from the scary Ghost of Christmas Future by hiding in the church. It surprises me - given the way that the Ghost of Christmas Present was designed - that nobody ever seems to have made a toy out of him.The inimitable Miss Piggy is a wonderful (and, dare I say it, borderline psycho) Mrs. Cratchit - it seems so right that she's enormous compared to Kermit, with all her curly blonde hair and her mob cap.One thing I was really sad to hear of is that some new DVD versions (I was watching my thirteen year old video) have cut the song When Love Is Gone. It may seem soppy to some, but I think it's an important bit of the story because it shows that Scrooge lost people he loved because he was so concerned with money.

The fake snow looks better and adds more Christmas atmosphere than real snow ever could, and I like the darkness of Scrooge's office - if he was too mean to provide lighting, it would have looked like that.I do like the interaction between Gonzo and Rizzo - Should we be worried about the kids in the audience?, No, this is culture - and the way they retreat from the scary Ghost of Christmas Future by hiding in the church. It surprises me - given the way that the Ghost of Christmas Present was designed - that nobody ever seems to have made a toy out of him.The inimitable Miss Piggy is a wonderful (and, dare I say it, borderline psycho) Mrs. Cratchit - it seems so right that she's enormous compared to Kermit, with all her curly blonde hair and her mob cap.One thing I was really sad to hear of is that some new DVD versions (I was watching my thirteen year old video) have cut the song When Love Is Gone. It may seem soppy to some, but I think it's an important bit of the story because it shows that Scrooge lost people he loved because he was so concerned with money.

If you're a fan of Dickens' writing, you'll like the way that much of the dialogue is lifted from his original novel and yet can still be understood by the audience, whatever their age. (Of course, Rizzo's literary observations don't hurt, either.) If you're into costumes you'll appreciate that the present cast are dressed in the typical 1840s Dickensian wardrobe, whereas in the Ghost of Christmas Past segment, the boy Scrooge wears Georgian clothing and the young man (who looks uncannily like a younger Michael Caine) dresses in Regency attire. And pretty much everybody can appreciate those wonderful Muppets.Although the tale of Ebeneezer Scrooge is well known as a simple Christmas parable, it's clear just how much work went into making this film really work - using Fozzie Bear as Fozziwig, for instance.
