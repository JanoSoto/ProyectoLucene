Later he had a spectacular comeback in Rushmore but if he had continued making this kind of fascinating films he could have eased his transition to exciting character actor much faster.This is such a great premise A man living the same day over and over again and to top it off, a day that he thinks is one of the worst days of his life. If the film had taken a direction in which the Murray character was a nice person it wouldn't have been as much fun as when we learn that he has contempt for almost everything in his life. This character is a variation on the character Murray played in Scrooged but as we go through his transformation to nice we sort of buy it this time. In Scrooged the transformation was a lot more forced.Add to that, a brilliant performance by Stephen Tobolowsky as Ned Ryerson. It's hard to play annoying and still make it funny but Tobolowsky is a pure treat to watch here. And as the icing on the cake we get Chris Elliott in his least memorable performance and I mean that as a good thing. Andie McDowell is sweet and cute but she is totally believable as a character who doesn't have a clue about Murray's situation and still thinks that there is something familiar about the whole thing she experiences in this one day.I am not saying that this is a masterpiece but it is easy to see why the director Harold Ramis and Murray was such a great partnership. Ramis knows how to build a scene and he knows comedy. Still, the movie tends to drag in the scenes that are supposed to be serious and the movie kind of ends abruptly after Murray wakes op next to Andie McDowell.

Ben Stiller (There's something about Mary) stars as Greg Focker, a simple nervous soul put in a vulnerable position when his girlfriend takes him to meet her parents. The simple idea spells disaster and although it's a very ambitious plot, the nature behind it is there with physical humour (watch for the garden scene) which although not laugh out loud is easy to smile to. I often felt embarrassed for the characters as this film has plenty of those 'awkward' silence moments none of us want to be involved in when meeting the parents but the fact that this conforms to every person's nightmare by the central character Stiller making a complete hash of everything is comic genius. Robert De Niro.Surprised to see him in such a role, I was very intrigued. Gone are the days when we would see him pull on the boxing gloves to fight powerfully in Oscar winning Raging Bull and the days when he would mutter 'are you talking to me?' Saying this, I am very happy to say that for me he made this film great. His observation tough guy image is reflecting in his dominance of his household over his children and guests.

A film which, ten years later or more can still hold the same emotional resonance and merit as it did when it was first released, and still be renowned as a genuinely quality piece. Dead Poets Society is one of those films which has withstood the ages, becoming somewhat iconic as a charming, but never cheesy sentimental tearjerker and uplifting tale of passion and hope all the same. When one watches it, it's really no wonder why the movie has lasted - there is simply so much to appreciate here, and never once does the film seem fake, as if the ideals are being beaten over our heads - they are simply presented in an optimistic light, attempting to sweep us up in their sense of enthusiasm and passion as well. It's movies like this which really bring the education system to light, and make us wonder if perhaps inspirationally different teachers such as the simply wonderful Robin Williams' John Keating were more commonplace, inspiring their students with a sheer passion for language and verse. Teachers who rather than beating the students down by throwing meaningless figures and statistics in their faces, actually encouraged their students to think for themselves, draw their own conclusions, and actually striving to seize the day and get all that they can out of life, instead of coasting aimlessly through it. It's in this aspect than any viewer with a soft spot for English literature and poetry especially is sure to melt shamelessly towards the sheer passion and emotion associated with them. Rather than poems being sappy and tedious, Keating brings the idea to life with fiery enthusiasm, making the author's sentiments leap off the page and into the heart. What raises Dead Poets Society from the ranks of other wannabes in its genre of education can be good films is how genuine and real it all seems, which makes the uplifting message seem all the more affecting, as it never seems contrived or sappy. The characters never once seem contrived, though they may be archetypes, these are real, breathing human beings we are watching, and we connect with them and care for them at a level which is almost unseen in modern movies. It's a genuinely heartwarming and affecting story, sold excellently by screenwriter Tom Schulman and driven home by the superb cast and seamless direction by the wonderful Peter Weir. Weir has a knack for filling his films with single unforgettable images, and Dead Poets Society is perhaps the most potent in this aspect - there are too many unforgettable scenes and shots to be counted, from Knox Overstreet riding his bike down the hill, scattering a flock of geese which fly up into the amber sunset, the soccer game where the students carry Mr. Keating on their shoulders, and of course the classic standing on desks scene. Without giving away the film's plot, safe to say this is a movie which sticks in your head for weeks to come. The film does on occasion show the slightest stumble in terms of plot or pacing, and not all audiences may buy into the sentimentality of the plot, but these are pittances for a film as genuine, affecting and simply spectacular as this. The simply wonderful cast, full mostly of previously unknown actors is what really brings the film to life, presenting us with a wide variety of realistic, relatable and for the most part, infectiously likable characters. Standouts include a pre-stardom Ethan Hawke as the shy and withdrawn Todd, TV actor Robert Sean Leonard as aspiring actor Neil, Gale Hansen, arguably stealing the show from all but Robin Williams as the wonderfully rebellious Charlie Nuwanda Dalton, and Josh Charles as the bashfully confident Knox Overstreet. That 70s show actor Kurtwood Smith proves that no one is better at playing the disproving old fashioned father than he is and Norman Lloyd makes a fiendishly evil villain as the repressive school headmaster. Still, there is no argument that the film without exception belongs to Robin Williams as perhaps the most wonderful teacher figure ever essayed on film. Williams sparks the film ablaze with his fiery passion and enthusiasm, never once going over the top but instead biting back his trademark energy to turn out a serious, superbly fine tuned and tremendously affecting performance, arguably still the best his career has shown. All in all, Dead Poets Society is one of those movies which actually fit the far too often used category of must see. For all struggling through months and years of tedious, repressive schooling, this movie should prove the perfect antidote, re-affirming the sense of enthusiasm and passion which would make the education system so much easier to bear, and actually inspire students to succeed in life, rather than coasting through with no enjoyment or enthusiasm. Robin Williams gives a superb performance, and director Peter Weir has accomplished a wonderful film which is sweet but not syrupy, passion and sentimentality devoid of sap. For a heartwarming, inspiring and moving movie experience, one need look no further than here.-9\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"5 January 2007","score":"","review":" Every once in a while, a film comes along which stands the test of time.

Standouts include a pre-stardom Ethan Hawke as the shy and withdrawn Todd, TV actor Robert Sean Leonard as aspiring actor Neil, Gale Hansen, arguably stealing the show from all but Robin Williams as the wonderfully rebellious Charlie Nuwanda Dalton, and Josh Charles as the bashfully confident Knox Overstreet. That 70s show actor Kurtwood Smith proves that no one is better at playing the disproving old fashioned father than he is and Norman Lloyd makes a fiendishly evil villain as the repressive school headmaster. Still, there is no argument that the film without exception belongs to Robin Williams as perhaps the most wonderful teacher figure ever essayed on film. Williams sparks the film ablaze with his fiery passion and enthusiasm, never once going over the top but instead biting back his trademark energy to turn out a serious, superbly fine tuned and tremendously affecting performance, arguably still the best his career has shown. All in all, Dead Poets Society is one of those movies which actually fit the far too often used category of must see. For all struggling through months and years of tedious, repressive schooling, this movie should prove the perfect antidote, re-affirming the sense of enthusiasm and passion which would make the education system so much easier to bear, and actually inspire students to succeed in life, rather than coasting through with no enjoyment or enthusiasm. Robin Williams gives a superb performance, and director Peter Weir has accomplished a wonderful film which is sweet but not syrupy, passion and sentimentality devoid of sap. For a heartwarming, inspiring and moving movie experience, one need look no further than here.-9\/10 ","genre":"Comedy, Drama"},{"date":"5 January 2007","score":"","review":" Every once in a while, a film comes along which stands the test of time. A film which, ten years later or more can still hold the same emotional resonance and merit as it did when it was first released, and still be renowned as a genuinely quality piece. Dead Poets Society is one of those films which has withstood the ages, becoming somewhat iconic as a charming, but never cheesy sentimental tearjerker and uplifting tale of passion and hope all the same. When one watches it, it's really no wonder why the movie has lasted - there is simply so much to appreciate here, and never once does the film seem fake, as if the ideals are being beaten over our heads - they are simply presented in an optimistic light, attempting to sweep us up in their sense of enthusiasm and passion as well. It's movies like this which really bring the education system to light, and make us wonder if perhaps inspirationally different teachers such as the simply wonderful Robin Williams' John Keating were more commonplace, inspiring their students with a sheer passion for language and verse. Teachers who rather than beating the students down by throwing meaningless figures and statistics in their faces, actually encouraged their students to think for themselves, draw their own conclusions, and actually striving to seize the day and get all that they can out of life, instead of coasting aimlessly through it. It's in this aspect than any viewer with a soft spot for English literature and poetry especially is sure to melt shamelessly towards the sheer passion and emotion associated with them. Rather than poems being sappy and tedious, Keating brings the idea to life with fiery enthusiasm, making the author's sentiments leap off the page and into the heart. What raises Dead Poets Society from the ranks of other wannabes in its genre of education can be good films is how genuine and real it all seems, which makes the uplifting message seem all the more affecting, as it never seems contrived or sappy. The characters never once seem contrived, though they may be archetypes, these are real, breathing human beings we are watching, and we connect with them and care for them at a level which is almost unseen in modern movies. It's a genuinely heartwarming and affecting story, sold excellently by screenwriter Tom Schulman and driven home by the superb cast and seamless direction by the wonderful Peter Weir. Weir has a knack for filling his films with single unforgettable images, and Dead Poets Society is perhaps the most potent in this aspect - there are too many unforgettable scenes and shots to be counted, from Knox Overstreet riding his bike down the hill, scattering a flock of geese which fly up into the amber sunset, the soccer game where the students carry Mr. Keating on their shoulders, and of course the classic standing on desks scene. Without giving away the film's plot, safe to say this is a movie which sticks in your head for weeks to come. The film does on occasion show the slightest stumble in terms of plot or pacing, and not all audiences may buy into the sentimentality of the plot, but these are pittances for a film as genuine, affecting and simply spectacular as this.

The movie's opening credits introduce this as a heterosexual story (or something like that), but Araki couldn't help but including some homosexual stuff. Araki, being the (openly) gay director that he is, just couldn't resist throwing in some homosexuality into this love triangle. But considering how much of other - much worse - perversion he included, homosexuality was basically begging to be included as well (and extremely mild by comparison). Araki's only, or primary, concern was to shock; never mind writing good dialog or presenting a clever story - the sole purpose was to repulse (or delight - if you like this sort of thing). There is (repeated) masturbation, homosexuality, decapitation, rape, McGowan's introduction into the wonderful world of threesome love (double-entry sex included), a man licking his own sperm, etc. And while some of this stuff is pretty heavy for a movie - and certainly too much to bear for most viewers to see all this stuff lumped together in one short movie - I wasn't really that shocked. I've basically seen all there is to see in films. However, Araki goes way over-the-top with the ultra-violent finale; Duval gets his penis cut off with huge pliers and then gets it shoved into his mouth. This isn't shocking; it's simply repulsive, but without serving any purpose whatsoever plot-wise.Some of the sexual situations could very well have had their debuts in the history of film. There is the scene in which Duval pisses, while he watches McGowan take a bath. He then gets horny and they have sex in the bathtub, while Schaech watches them, masturbates, comes, and then licks his own sperm (not that licking anyone else's is any less disgusting). Or there is a scene in which Duval catches McGowan cheating on him by having sex with Schaech, and how does Duval react to this? He doesn't get angry or even; he starts masturbating. One of the earlier scenes had McGowan and Duval trying to have sex in the car, but Duval couldn't get it up. (This may or may not be an intentional similarity to Bonnie & Clyde; Clyde couldn't get it up at all.) In yet another scene McGowan is encouraged by the free-spirited Schaech (who somehow reminded me of Motley Crew's moronic Tommy Lee) to be more open-minded and stick her finger up his anus while he was penetrating her. She reluctantly agreed, but learned to love it. Who wouldn't? Certainly no one in this movie would mind it.Characters come and go, and they all want to kill the members of our love-triangle. Araki sets up a certain amount of characterization, but keeps it very basic; McGowan is the anarchic and confident young female, Duval is a borderline moron, and Schaech is the mysterious stranger with no self-imposed limitations as far as sex, and to a lesser extent violence, are concerned. All the other characters are at least as confused and violent as the main trio. Wherever they go they are met with hostility, for no other reason than to give Araki a chance to do something brutal in the film, over and over. Araki's attempts at humour certainly curb a lot of the impact of the violence, some of which is pretty much in the zombie vein of an early Peter Jackson film; for example, a guy's head gets cut off but continues to live and talk, or the fast-food guy getting his arm severed, but without being phased too much. The dialog and situations are primitive. Anyone could have written this script. But it takes a twisted-minded lunatic like Araki to actually do it, and then even make a movie out of it. The humour is also primitive, and rarely amusing, though there are maybe one or two uncharacteristically wry observations. One of those cleverer moments, absurdly, comes from the dumb-as-dirt Duval, who asks McGowan whether her love for him only means that he will do for the time being until someone better comes along strange as it may seem, this primitive and ultra-extreme movie has succeeded, through Duval's just-mentioned statement-question, in making the best definition of love that I have ever heard.

Hollywood is Jewish, and any movie, documentary, or short film - bad or good - that deals with Jews in WWII always gets an Oscar. I haven't seen Schindler's List and I am unlikely to ever see it; firstly, I generally boycott Spielberg's terrible dramas (which always seem to have the worst casts imaginable), and, secondly, I think that one gets a far better impression of what sort of a hell concentration camps must have been from the numerous hard-hitting and immensely depressing documentaries made on the subject. I've seen some of those documentaries and am absolutely convinced that Spielberg's overly-polished and superficial style can never even get close to that kind of realism.I welcome any director's attempts to bring the holocaust to the attention of a historically-challenged and ignorant American public, but I doubt that Spielberg's motives were entirely noble. He made this film-project look like some kind of a personal crusade to remind the world of the suffering of Jews in WWII, but the crusade was more about winning recognition from Hollywood and its dumb Oscar-voters than anything else. Who really needed Schindler's List most? Spielberg. And to prove that his search for critical recognition takes over any other interests when making a movie one need only look at the two serious films he made after Schindler's List Amistad and Saving Private Ryan. Amistad was supposed to be for American blacks what Schindler's List was for Jews, and hence garner him the same kind of Oscar recognition. However, this blatantly politically-correct film must have turned out to be so bad that even the ultra-PC Hollywood decided not to honour Spielberg for it. (I believe it only got one Oscar what a disappointment for Spielberg.) And I mean it must be a really awful film; after all, even the terrible Gandhi wasn't awful enough to prevent it receiving tons of Oscars. Saving Private Ryan, with its uniquely bad cast of actors who look as out of place in WWII as Sean Connery in an gay indie movie, is another very obvious and cynical attempt by Spielberg to get more Oscars American men fighting for America's freedom, in a three-hour spectacle. This time Spielberg's true-and-tried tactic worked. How could Hollywood say no? His interviews, his behaviour, and the statements that he made, all clearly show that awards mean more to him than anything else on this planet. He is a recognition-seeker; a true megalomaniac who lacks the modesty to be known only as a popular director; he wants unanimous critical recognition, too, and will do anything to get it. He also seems to lack the intellect to realize that awards don't prove at all that your movie is better than the others. When he receives an award Spielberg glows with joy. Obviously, everyone is happy when they win an Oscar, Golden Globe, New York's Critics Award (etc.), but Spielberg puts truly ridiculous significance on it. To prove my point, this man was actually deeply disappointed(!) that he lost to Shakespeare in Love (another dumb movie, by the way). Nevermind that Spielberg won the Best Director Oscar - this wasn't enough for him. He wanted it ALL! The man is pathetic.

I haven't seen Schindler's List and I am unlikely to ever see it; firstly, I generally boycott Spielberg's terrible dramas (which always seem to have the worst casts imaginable), and, secondly, I think that one gets a far better impression of what sort of a hell concentration camps must have been from the numerous hard-hitting and immensely depressing documentaries made on the subject. I've seen some of those documentaries and am absolutely convinced that Spielberg's overly-polished and superficial style can never even get close to that kind of realism.I welcome any director's attempts to bring the holocaust to the attention of a historically-challenged and ignorant American public, but I doubt that Spielberg's motives were entirely noble. He made this film-project look like some kind of a personal crusade to remind the world of the suffering of Jews in WWII, but the crusade was more about winning recognition from Hollywood and its dumb Oscar-voters than anything else. Who really needed Schindler's List most? Spielberg. And to prove that his search for critical recognition takes over any other interests when making a movie one need only look at the two serious films he made after Schindler's List Amistad and Saving Private Ryan. Amistad was supposed to be for American blacks what Schindler's List was for Jews, and hence garner him the same kind of Oscar recognition. However, this blatantly politically-correct film must have turned out to be so bad that even the ultra-PC Hollywood decided not to honour Spielberg for it. (I believe it only got one Oscar what a disappointment for Spielberg.) And I mean it must be a really awful film; after all, even the terrible Gandhi wasn't awful enough to prevent it receiving tons of Oscars. Saving Private Ryan, with its uniquely bad cast of actors who look as out of place in WWII as Sean Connery in an gay indie movie, is another very obvious and cynical attempt by Spielberg to get more Oscars American men fighting for America's freedom, in a three-hour spectacle. This time Spielberg's true-and-tried tactic worked. How could Hollywood say no? His interviews, his behaviour, and the statements that he made, all clearly show that awards mean more to him than anything else on this planet. He is a recognition-seeker; a true megalomaniac who lacks the modesty to be known only as a popular director; he wants unanimous critical recognition, too, and will do anything to get it. He also seems to lack the intellect to realize that awards don't prove at all that your movie is better than the others. When he receives an award Spielberg glows with joy. Obviously, everyone is happy when they win an Oscar, Golden Globe, New York's Critics Award (etc.), but Spielberg puts truly ridiculous significance on it. To prove my point, this man was actually deeply disappointed(!) that he lost to Shakespeare in Love (another dumb movie, by the way). Nevermind that Spielberg won the Best Director Oscar - this wasn't enough for him. He wanted it ALL! The man is pathetic. The after-Oscar party of DreamWorks was reported to have been covered in a cloud of misery! The man is an idiot.Politically speaking, what makes Spielberg even more easy to hate are his obvious and predictable leanings to the Left. This man - this Hollywood hypocrite - who claims to champion the Jewish cause supports Clinton. Clinton's Middle East policy is clearly anti-Israeli and pro-Palestinian. (And the less said about his bitch wife, the better.) Yet this dumb, self-absorbed Hollywood Jew supports this hillbilly Arkansas moron. Like most American Jews, Spielberg shows a very disappointing lack of support for his Jewish brothers in Israel. I can imagine how frustrated and even angry most Israelis must get when they just think of Hollywood Jews; only a few of the latter seem to truly understand Israel and even fewer show loyalty to it. (An example Hillary openly supports and visits Arafat, whom she considers a friend(!), yet advance polls showed that most Jews would still vote for her if she ran for a New York senate seat!) Spielberg stands as a symbol for the worst kind of American Jew a left-leaning Hollywood hypocrite, who plays the role of a do-gooder, but whose sole interests in life are power and money. And recognition. The question isn't whether he is a hypocrite\/scumbag or just an ignorant moron. He is both. And his latest film, Munich, proves more than ever that he is as anti-Israeli and anti-Semitic as Hamas. A little exaggeration, perhaps, but only a little one.

Well, there are multiple answers, but if there is one film that fits this description, it's The Emperor's New Groove. With stellar voice work, pacing that is faster than most films within the past decade, and also containing a dose of silliness that just doesn't happen in enough films, this Disney animated flick stands as the best amongst the animated Disney films (excluding Pixar) within the past three decades and easily the most underrated. While we see Stitch everywhere, the furious campaign behind Chicken Little, and the attempt to make a worldwide smash out of Dinosaur, Disney seemed to have little support towards this little flick. Nonetheless, this is the little film that could; as it defied lower-budgeted animation, defied a song listing, and delivered some of the funniest moments and one-liners in animated history. It also managed to destroy the long-running Seinfeld curse, as it made Patrick Warburton a solidified voice-acting star. Most amazing, David Spade was actually quite funny without the assistance of Chris Farley. The Emperor's New Groove follows a bratty prince by the name of Kuzco (David Spade) that lives without a care in the world as everyone caters to his every whim without question. When he fires his adviser though, things get interesting as Yzma (Eartha Kitt) and her dumb yet reliable assistant Kronk attempt to kill him, only to instead turn him into a llama. After the mishap, Kuzko needs to actually rely on someone other than himself (Pancha, voiced by John Goodman) to regain his position at the throne and stop Yzma. Easier said than done, as Kuzco must change his ways in order to succeed. Lilo and Stitch is not the black sheep of Disney films like advertised, its this one. With only one song, lack of detailed animation, total rundown of the fourth wall, and also a defiance of a plot without its holes, The Emperor's New Groove relies on quick, witty humor and its lively animation to keep the kids and adults entertained. To add to that, this is the first Disney film in ages to contain some true character development, as we see Kuzco slowly rise from a selfish brat into a likable character as he spends more time becoming a llama. Partly written and directed by Mark Dindal, his fast-paced animation and action techniques were perfected here after the underrated flop Cats Don't Dance years before. The voice acting is what carries this film from decent to beyond superb. From the zany and quick-witted David Spade, to the veteran John Goodman, to the funny and lively talents of Eartha Kitt and Patrick Warburton, those four ran the film with excellent one-liners, funny moments, and a chemistry that is very rare amongst animated films. Easily some of the best voice work in any animated film, as long as one of the four was at the screen talking, the laughs would just continue rolling in. We even have the late veteran John Fiedler lending his voice in a hysterical cameo. Easily quotable movie, and that is always a plus. One can say that this has a sort of Frat Pack comedic-like quality to it, as it doesn't rely on a deep story with morals, but instead on humorous situations and quirky lines to convince the viewer to watch again and again. Bottom Line Among the best non-Pixar animated films within the past two decades, Emperor's New Groove is a fresh new look at the way Disney films are made. No longer do we have a romance story, no longer do we have a Disney princess in distress, we have a great cast of lovable characters in an environment that even gets the viewers involved. With a zany plot, clever one-liners, a lot of visual humor and a running time that never actually drags, there is really nothing really wrong with this movie. David Spade's last funny movie, the destruction of the Senfeld curse, and also the revival of Eartha Kitt's career can be found here. Watch it, no matter how old you are and what kinds of films you enjoy. Anyone that doesn't get a kick out of this one just doesn't have a sense of humor. 10\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"5 January 2007","score":"","review":" What film is one part insane, one part extremely fast-paced, and overall a movie that breaks down the fourth wall so many times you are almost involved in the film itself?

Bottom Line Among the best non-Pixar animated films within the past two decades, Emperor's New Groove is a fresh new look at the way Disney films are made. No longer do we have a romance story, no longer do we have a Disney princess in distress, we have a great cast of lovable characters in an environment that even gets the viewers involved. With a zany plot, clever one-liners, a lot of visual humor and a running time that never actually drags, there is really nothing really wrong with this movie. David Spade's last funny movie, the destruction of the Senfeld curse, and also the revival of Eartha Kitt's career can be found here. Watch it, no matter how old you are and what kinds of films you enjoy. Anyone that doesn't get a kick out of this one just doesn't have a sense of humor. 10\/10 ","genre":"Animation, Adventure, Comedy"},{"date":"5 January 2007","score":"","review":" What film is one part insane, one part extremely fast-paced, and overall a movie that breaks down the fourth wall so many times you are almost involved in the film itself? Well, there are multiple answers, but if there is one film that fits this description, it's The Emperor's New Groove. With stellar voice work, pacing that is faster than most films within the past decade, and also containing a dose of silliness that just doesn't happen in enough films, this Disney animated flick stands as the best amongst the animated Disney films (excluding Pixar) within the past three decades and easily the most underrated. While we see Stitch everywhere, the furious campaign behind Chicken Little, and the attempt to make a worldwide smash out of Dinosaur, Disney seemed to have little support towards this little flick. Nonetheless, this is the little film that could; as it defied lower-budgeted animation, defied a song listing, and delivered some of the funniest moments and one-liners in animated history. It also managed to destroy the long-running Seinfeld curse, as it made Patrick Warburton a solidified voice-acting star. Most amazing, David Spade was actually quite funny without the assistance of Chris Farley. The Emperor's New Groove follows a bratty prince by the name of Kuzco (David Spade) that lives without a care in the world as everyone caters to his every whim without question. When he fires his adviser though, things get interesting as Yzma (Eartha Kitt) and her dumb yet reliable assistant Kronk attempt to kill him, only to instead turn him into a llama. After the mishap, Kuzko needs to actually rely on someone other than himself (Pancha, voiced by John Goodman) to regain his position at the throne and stop Yzma. Easier said than done, as Kuzco must change his ways in order to succeed. Lilo and Stitch is not the black sheep of Disney films like advertised, its this one. With only one song, lack of detailed animation, total rundown of the fourth wall, and also a defiance of a plot without its holes, The Emperor's New Groove relies on quick, witty humor and its lively animation to keep the kids and adults entertained. To add to that, this is the first Disney film in ages to contain some true character development, as we see Kuzco slowly rise from a selfish brat into a likable character as he spends more time becoming a llama. Partly written and directed by Mark Dindal, his fast-paced animation and action techniques were perfected here after the underrated flop Cats Don't Dance years before. The voice acting is what carries this film from decent to beyond superb. From the zany and quick-witted David Spade, to the veteran John Goodman, to the funny and lively talents of Eartha Kitt and Patrick Warburton, those four ran the film with excellent one-liners, funny moments, and a chemistry that is very rare amongst animated films. Easily some of the best voice work in any animated film, as long as one of the four was at the screen talking, the laughs would just continue rolling in. We even have the late veteran John Fiedler lending his voice in a hysterical cameo. Easily quotable movie, and that is always a plus.

Having rewatched it after Casino Royale had re-ignited my interest in the Britain's most famous spy, I found that the film holds up remarkably well and is heaps of fun.There are really only two things - a small one and a big one - that let this film down for me. Small one is the awful tinny score that plays during the otherwise fantastic cliff race near the beginning. Bleh, bleh, bleh. The second, I'm sorry to say, is James Bond himself. Now, I like Pierce Brosnan; he has charm and sophistication about him, looks heavenly in a dinner jacket and is smooth with quips and one-liners. But his Bond is just way too self-consciously smarmy and smug for my liking. And I feel that whenever the script tries to go beyond the polished surface and give the character some dramatic weight, Brosnan is completely lifeless and the scenes themselves are rendered emotionally flat. Mind you, I'm not sure whether it's the fault of the actor himself or whether it's just that the film tries to have it both ways and those character moments simply don't gel with the overall silly-ish, glossy vibe of the film.Thankfully, this movie also possesses a hugely entertaining ensemble of secondary characters, not the least of which is Famke Janssen's sexy and demented Xenia Onatopp, a truly outrageous, over-the-top bad Bond girl who revels in being a sensual, bloodthirsty monster. Alan Cumming is also fun in the cartoonish yet enjoyable role of Boris Grishenko, an evil uber-geek. Sean Bean is cold and ruthless as a former 00 agent turned traitor; he's also pretty much the only reason why his character's scenes with Bond have at least some measure of the intensity to them. Izabella Scorupco makes a charming and endearing good Bond girl who's actually got a brain and is relevant to the plot. Robbie Coltrane and the inimitable Dame Judi Dench have brief but memorable appearances as the former KGB agent turned crook and M, Bond's formidable boss who openly dislikes her charge.The opening scene involving a dam and a bungee jump is still pretty spectacular, as is the tank chase through the streets of St Petersburg, one of my most favourite cities in the whole world. It gives me a giggle to see Bond cheerfully destroying public property and driving with a big bronze horse on the top of the tank, ) So yeah, I still like this flick a lot and it's one of the only two Bond films I've really enjoyed.

This movie is made with real flair and an ear for talk. I would suggest watching it with English SUBTITLES ON. This is the great innovation of DVD and it makes the picture a bit more coherent. There is a section when Pitt delivers one of his prodigious mumbles that the subtitles simply give up. It is actually totally invented by Pitt. Don't worry if you aren't getting it all the first time you see it. It's really a small tour de force by Ritchie and needs to be seen at least twice to get the full effect.

This laughable, ludicrous suspense movie is all about making an anti-U.S. hence anti-capitalism statement about the oh-so horrible detachment and isolation that rule the western world, an environment in which people care only about themselves, where no one will help anyone and where things just look damn, damn grim. As opposed to the warm environments of socialist and communist societies in which people never cease smiling and where everybody is always ready to take the last shirt of his back to give to a person in need. Yeah, right...The movie is so idiotic it defies belief. What is even more preposterous that it is rated highly by critics, often described as underrated or overlooked. First of all, the way De Havilland loses electricity is too stupid, even for a 60s movie her son leaves the house, leaving behind a sort-of suicide note, and just as he is unpacking his car he hits some ladders which disable the electric cables. How brilliant! Perhaps brilliant in a simple-minded comic-book or a comedy-of-errors type story - but certainly not here. Then De Havilland rings her alarm on and on and on, but the very very evil capitalist citizens ignore her alarm, for they are too busy amassing riches and property which is all these goddamn no-good capitalist a**holes really care about, ain't it? After a while, a whino enters the house, then his fat woman friend, and then a totally ridiculous trio of hooligans who learned their acting technique in the Freddie Francis School of Mugging and Overacting.There is nothing suspenseful about this movie. It is too silly to be taken seriously, which is the main ingredient for suspense. The social commentary is pathetic, and quite embarrassing. When Caan and de Havilland have an exchange we see the left-wing stereotypes rolling in Havilland - the selfish rich person out of touch with reality, and Caan - the hooligan who turned out so because the evil capitalist society made him so, and so the poor thing turned to violence as his only means out. So touching... *sob*...A film for morons.

Thats what stops me from giving it a ten. But the message is good, very good and maybe society needs to be spoon fed to see these matters clearly. This is all about how materialism sucks up your soul away from the precious, most precious things in life that you got to hold on to and give prime importance to. Not because super sexy Al Pacino will come along in what may very well be his peak act as a bad guy, because here he plays THE bad guy with a good explanation and speech\/lecture abut a lot of spiritual concerns from the Devil's point of view. Anyways I always thought lawyers to be the scum of the earth. And they could have chosen someone better that Keanu if you ask me, but he is OK.
