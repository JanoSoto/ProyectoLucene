Although I gave the film the same 10\/10 score and my highest praise, a lot has happened since my first viewing. The beauty of the film is that it (vastly more than any other film I have seen) does not leave you after you finish watching it.After I first watched 2001 A Space Odyssey, I quickly realized what an incredible achievement it was. Unfortunately, I have recommended it to several people that did not enjoy it as much. My father remarked that Kubrick must have been on drugs, my mother did not understand any of it (although after reading the book, she decided she liked it), my brother called it bland, my classmate felt it was immensely tedious (and his roommate hated the movie altogether). I only know a couple people personally that liked it. I suppose this shows the dividing opinions from the public of the film (although critics generally love it). Either way, I would like to explain why this is currently my favorite movie.2001 A Space Odyssey is unlike any other movie around. Instead of focusing on story or drama, it is a massive visual and artistic experience. It is so unconventional that you must watch it under its own terms (for first time viewers patience). Upon my first viewing, it felt much like the space missions I dreamed about as a kid. The experience was surreal. You actually feel like you are part of the events because it is played out so meticulously. There are no shortcuts; the space ship maneuvers and astronaut procedures may feel long or tedious to some people, but for me it carried an enormous sense of isolation, realism, and the cold void of space. The ideas and themes brought out by the movie are very creative and kept me mentally engaged the entire time. It makes me feel like a child experiencing something new and special for the first time.The Dawn of Man segment starts off the movie with an iconic moment with apes discovering a mysterious monolith. The reactions of the apes show how far man has evolved from a primitive and savage state. The monolith sparks the realization of the existence of tools into the apes, visualized by the use of a bone as a club. This carried human evolution into the year 2001, where their entire existence depends on new, more sophisticated tools. The brilliance of Kubrick is that the space vehicles and structures largely resemble anatomical features, retaining a connection with the past. When a new monolith is discovered on the moon, a whole new stage of evolution begins.An occasional complaint that I hear which makes no sense to me is that the acting is bad. Where is there a moment of a bad acting? The characters are exactly what you expect astronauts and scientists to be like. This is not a drama, so you should not expect characters giving long monologues or showing extreme emotions. That said, the one character that really stands out is the computer HAL-9000. A complex mix of cold menace and childish innocence, it opens up interesting speculation about the (still) future prospects of artificial intelligence.The music is absolutely outstanding, from the epic (and symbolic) fanfare of the introduction, to the strident vocals of the monolith encounters, and to the gentle waltzes that are played during the space scenes. It adds a lot of substance to the scenes that flow a little slower. The cinematography is practically flawless. The one trait that is universally appreciated is the special effects, so I won't add too much more discussion to that aspect. I should mention that I believe this is the best use of special effects in any movie; although newer films have better technology to use, they rarely use it in the best ways.Upon my first viewing, I decided that the ending, while fascinating, was overly abstract. Afterwards, I thought about it for a while and realized that it was truly a great sequence. The symbolic imagery and significance is phenomenal, unmatched by any other film. I have a hard time imagining any better ending to the film.Some people compare this movie to art, but I think that is only part of it. It is an amazing journey that left me agape. It was eerily realistic and touched upon the most important themes in history. Significance like this is lost in many of today's blockbusters. Watching this movie is the best way to experience space exploration (ignoring actually becoming an astronaut). As a science fiction fan, I am glad to label it as the epitome of science fiction. This is the movie that made me respect Stanley Kubrick. It currently sits comfortably on the top of my favorite movies list. It has changed the way I watched movies. More importantly, it changed the way I viewed life and the universe. It earns my absolute highest recommendation.

I've noticed a lot of reviewers calling this the typical buddy film. De Niro is in no way Murphy's buddy throughout most of this movie. In fact, part of the comedy of this film is De Niro's reluctance to be friends with anybody.Murphy really shines in this one. He is back at doing what he does best, acting like a complete ham. He is a cop who wants so much to be an actor and enjoys being in the reality show. De Niro is perfect as the straight man who thinks the entire thing is stupid. I thought the two of them had great chemistry and were a perfect casting choice. Rene Russo is also great as the TV producer. Of course, she loves everything Murphy does and tries so hard (along with Murhpy) to get DeNiro going too.A lot of reviewers have touched on the hilarious scene with William Shatner, reprising his role as TJ Hooker to train Murhpy & De Niro how to act like cops. But, my favorite scene involves Murphy in the confessional hoping he could get a Wesly Snipes-Like cop to team up with instead of De Niro. Man, that was hilarious! Comedies often depend on your personal tastes. Sure you could poke holes in the plot, most often you can with a comedy. I was psyched to see the pairing of Murphy and De Niro...I think it brought out the best in Murphy, which was nice to see him at the top of his game again. I can only imagine it was a great honor for Murphy to be paired with the great De Niro. Rating 8 of 10 stars.

In fact, part of the comedy of this film is De Niro's reluctance to be friends with anybody.Murphy really shines in this one. He is back at doing what he does best, acting like a complete ham. He is a cop who wants so much to be an actor and enjoys being in the reality show. De Niro is perfect as the straight man who thinks the entire thing is stupid. I thought the two of them had great chemistry and were a perfect casting choice. Rene Russo is also great as the TV producer. Of course, she loves everything Murphy does and tries so hard (along with Murhpy) to get DeNiro going too.A lot of reviewers have touched on the hilarious scene with William Shatner, reprising his role as TJ Hooker to train Murhpy & De Niro how to act like cops. But, my favorite scene involves Murphy in the confessional hoping he could get a Wesly Snipes-Like cop to team up with instead of De Niro. Man, that was hilarious! Comedies often depend on your personal tastes. Sure you could poke holes in the plot, most often you can with a comedy. I was psyched to see the pairing of Murphy and De Niro...I think it brought out the best in Murphy, which was nice to see him at the top of his game again. I can only imagine it was a great honor for Murphy to be paired with the great De Niro. Rating 8 of 10 stars.

It portrays a fictionalized account of the life of famous classical composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, emphasizing an intense rivalry between him and composer Antonio Salieri. The film creates a great sense of period with lavish sets and elegant costumes.Tom Hulce leads the cast as Mozart with great energy and he creates a memorable character. Mozart is portrayed as a man whose vices and juvenile conduct are only exceeded by his genius in creating music. My favorite performance of the film, however, is F. Murray Abraham's skillful performance as Mozart's rival, Antonio Salieri. He convincingly creates a Salieri that narrates the story as a conniving and bitter man, but manages to elicit sympathy when he laments that he can never be as prolific or well-known as Mozart. There are excellent supporting performances in the film, too, including Elizabeth Berridge as Mozart's patient wife Constanze and Jeffrey Jones as Emperor Joseph II with a matter-of-fact manner.The rivalry between Mozart and Salieri is well-developed and the film never becomes tiresome despite its length. In addition to the characterizations, the film appropriately includes dazzling segments of classical music and representations of staged operas. The end narration of Salieri is very well-written and touching. Truly F. Murray Abraham's Salieri is a champion for mediocrity.
