I was expecting one big Jurassic Park ripoff but the movie really isn't being one. It's a movie that just also happens to feature a dinosaur in it but other than that, there are very little similarities between these both movies.But having said that, this still is a pretty bad movie to watch. The one thing that bugged me the most was that it didn't really seemed to have a main character in it. Instead the movie follows a whole bunch of different characters, that we just never really get to know and the movie keeps on introducing new characters, pretty much till half way through the movie. It also definitely prevents you from ever getting into this movie and it even makes the story somewhat confusing, though for these sort of the movies the stories of course aren't exactly the best written ones to begin with already and often are completely secondary to the movie.The best thing I can say about this movie is that it at least knows what it is and doesn't pretend to be anything good or clever. You can tell that most people simply had fun while making this movie and didn't took it very serious at all.Also I must say that I very much prefer the old fashioned special effects, complete with fake looking puppets and a guy in a suit, over some incredibly fake looking CGI effects, that you are likely to see in movies of this sort now days.Don't expect much gore or other great horror elements though. It's all pretty tame, especially by todays standards.

While it was a childhood favorite of mine, I recently had a chance to re-watch it, and I have to say, it just doesn't hold up. It suffers from a loose plotting and a disturbingly cruel nature, and I'm shocked my parents actually let me watch it.Savage stars as Brian Stevenson, a young boy who has just moved to a new neighborhood, and is feeling sad because he lost all of his friends. When strange pranks appear, set up all over his house during the night, he is blamed by his parents for setting them up, even though he denies it. In addition, his younger brother claims to have seen a monster that comes out from under his bed at night. Soon, Brian encounters the monster- Maurice (Mandel), a playful and nutty humanoid with bright blue skin, who introduces him to the world of monsters underneath his bed- a massive land with all sorts of creatures who do nothing but play pranks, scare kids and play video games.However, over time, Brian realizes that the pranks and fun have consequences, and he and Maurice are forced to help his brother Eric, whom is subsequently kidnapped by Boy, the evil leader of the monsters.To give credit where it is due, the film has a strong atmosphere. Although it's meant to be fun, the introduction to the film and the third act are meant to be creepy and unsettling for the audiences, and I will say, this film is oozing with atmosphere and the general creeps. It is well paced and well-shot, and it is very eerie for children. Particularly some of the earlier jumps and some of the monsters.In addition, the script (by future Pirates of the Caribbean scribes Ted Elliot and Terry Rossio) is quite imaginative, although it has been long-rumored that many scenes were cut and re-written, and that the final product differs greatly from the first draft.Finally, the music is incredible. It's very haunting and has an air of sorrow, mixed with hints of joy. It gives a good tone and emulates the up's and down's of the story magnificently.However, there are two huge, looming problems with the film.First, despite the imagination, the film isn't well-written. Characters are established well, but are not necessarily likable. And the plot is just a mess. In fact, the plot doesn't really exist until the last half-hour. Up until then, it's more of a series of skits and pranks. The villain (Boy) and his motivations are not made clear, and the climax, without spoiling anything, is a non-sensical, sloppy mess. It brings the film down a few points, and takes away from the scenes that do indeed work.Secondly, this is a very dark, cruel film. Many scenes involve pranks played by the monsters, which become increasingly dark and morally questionable. Scenes involving tricking young children into drinking urine, scaring infants, tampering with food, destroying property, etc. break past the border of bad taste. And there is a great deal of violence in the film, including characters being kidnapped, burned, beaten up, and even a creepy scene where a monster is decapitated and has its head replaced with a pumpkin. It's very dark, and it's inappropriate for children under 12, I'd say. (Which is the target market, as kids who are any older are probably not going to like it) And the bigger problem is that there are no real consequences for the cruelty and violence, making the theme of responsibility very hollow and hypocritical.This film is a mess. It deserves about a 3 out of 10, but my nostalgia for it, and the sleepless nights of creeps it gave me has elevated it to about a 5 out of 10. I'd say it's decent for older children, but parents should plan on watching it with their kids, and making sure the theme of responsibility was clear to them.

He is at his comedic best in this movie. His delivery of the most ridiculous lines with a completely straight face really sells the comedy.Leslie Nielsen plays Lt. Frank Drebin of Police Squad a special division of the police force. He bumbles his way through investigations in a manner somewhat reminiscent of Peter Sellers' Inspector Dreyfus.This movie is actually a continuation of the show Police Squad! They kept much of the same cast but made it a little more mainstream. Give this movie a watch and then if you liked that, find a copy of Police Squad! and watch that too.
