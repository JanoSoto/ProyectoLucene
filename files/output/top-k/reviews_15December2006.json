I was the second assistant director, and I got onto the show after doing a couple of pilots at 20th Century Fox. I almost literally ran into Jack Terry, the UPM, on the steps of the Fox Commissary. I have no idea why he was on the lot, but we knew each other from a TV pilot I had worked on in Georgia, so we got to chatting. He rather casually mentioned he was working on this show called Norma Rae, and told me he needed a 2nd A.D. and asked if I would be interested. Since I knew and respected Jack, I was elated and took the job without hesitation. As it turned out, the executive in charge of production at the studio at the time was also someone I knew from TV days -- a true gentleman by the name of Herb Wallerstein. I knew then that I was in good shape politically speaking because I already knew and liked my two main bosses (on a feature film, the second A.D. does all of the paperwork, and provides eyes and ears on the set -- even if inadvertently -- for the studio and production company. It is understood that you, as a key second A.D., answer to several bosses, not just the First A.D.&#151;the studio being the ultimate boss). Unlike in television, where the first A.D. has a lot of authority or -- rather -- the studio exercises a lot of its authority THROUGH the first A.D., the director generally picks the first A.D. for feature films, as Mart Ritt did in this picture, and the first answers, more or less, to the director.. I Marty he had some serious doubts about his decision later on, but that is a different story. Marty Ritt was a fabulous -- if gruff -- director. He was always fair and straightforward with the people under him. I can't say enough good about him. But we DID have our moments! I had the great honor to be given a wonderful trainee assistant director, Paul Moen, to help me on the show. Paul would go on to be a much bigger success in the industry than I ever was&#151;and it was well deserved! After a brief prep period at Fox I arrived, along with most of the rest of the crew, on location in Opelika. It must have been early summer, because it wasn't particularly hot when we got there. But it GOT hot quickly and just as quickly evolved into the hot, sticky, occasionally relieved by summer rain so common in Southern Alabama and Georgia. One of the first things that became apparent was that the factory would involve some pretty awful working conditions. The place was a real, working cotton mill (Opelika Manufacturing) and it was noisy, dirty and the floors actually bounced up and down from the looms running in the factory, making shooting conditions difficult at best. MOST of the extras in the mill, by the way, were not only the people who worked there, but they had actually gone through the unionization process themselves fairly recently (the importance of unions and unionization was, of course, a major theme in the film). Every crew member had to be fitted with earplugs to protect their ears from noise (just like the ones Sally uses in the film). Because setting lights was difficult at best the gaffer, Earl Gilbert (called The Indian, but I don't know why), went through the factory and replaced all of the florescent lights with lights that had a color temperature conducent for filming. In order to communicate with each other, we used the standard studio Motorola walkie talkies attached to headphones they use at airports for use on the tarmac. But the most important piece of equipment on that set was, by far, the cinematographer himself&#151;John Alonzo. John was built like a fireplug and steady as a rock, and could handhold just about any shot WITHOUT the then new invention of a Steadicam! Although we had an excellent camera operator, John did a lot of the operating himself and, as I recall, a lot of the shots inside the factory were filmed by John hand-holding the camera. Oh, and we were also encouraged to wear dusk masks while working there. The air was filled with tiny cotton filaments which had over the years, I am sure, contributed to the brown lung disease common among cotton mill workers. But I said it was a good show to work on, and it was. Though the assistant director and UPM typically schedule a days shooting on a feature film, Marty Ritt did his own scheduling and would invariably show up with a slightly different plan&#151;and a shorter day &#150; than was planned by the production office. But, since Marty pre-edited everything in his head before filming, he only shot what he needed and we were, therefore, ALWAYS ahead of schedule! It was disconcerting to almost daily tell the crew of the changed in plans but, somehow, it almost always worked out. Marty, Sally, Ron and, I believe, the producers and writers all lived in separate quarters from the rest of us. Up near a lake somewhere, while we were all in that darned Holiday Inn with the lousy food (I would eventually move out with my trainee, Paul, and rent a seedy mobile home trailer and save the difference in cash from the per diem&#151;all perfectly legal back then). Well, there's lots more to tell about this show, but I think I'm running out of room for this comment and I need to wrap it up. But, assuming IMDb will allow me, I'll add some more later.

Settings and Costumes.The costumes are fantastic and a lot of effort was used which made me admire the film in this respect, as did the setting. However it was a shame that the narrative really didn't reflect the time because these features would have meant so much more. watch it if...you enjoy light hearted entertainmentone scene involving the father\/son towards the end is deserving of a higher mark than what is given. its a poorly constructed narrative with a few great scenes but the acting and repetitive jokes\/action sequences brings down its overall value.

I will admit, I am fascinated by the tragedy of this ship. This has got to be one of the biggest tragedies in world history. I have always enjoyed researching this topic and finding out everything I can about exactly what happened that fateful night.Now to get on to my movie review. This movie captured the tragedy of what happened April 14-15 1912. James Cameron is a fabulous director. He captured the fear of what the passengers must have been going through on that fateful night.Now onto Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet. They both did such a fantastic job in portraying their characters. I was blown away. The on-screen chemistry between the two of them was absolutely fantastic. The two roles without a doubt launched the two of them into the fantastic careers they both have. Any movie I have seen either one of them in including Titanic, have shown their skills phenomenally. I recently saw The Beach, the movie Leo did after Titanic and although the movie was a flop, Leo did a fantastic job as always. I have seen Kate in Finding Neverland and that is without a doubt one of my favorite movies of all time. She portrayed her character so well. That film nearly brought me to tears.Overall, this movie is a fantastic movie. It is a cinematic masterpiece that will go down in history as the biggest grossing film of all time.The best part of this movie was without a doubt when Jack was in the ocean and Rose was on the door and she tells him she loves him. That is the best part. It's situations like that, that really show you who a person really is.This movie can relate to real life so much. Even without thinking about the historical context of the movie. Everyone goes through love and at some point in life people feel the tragedy of losing someone.

His brother (Roy Scheider) is part of some shadowy government agency he's a spy of some kind and lots of people want to kill him, but I have no idea why.

The ethnic charms and foibles of the community are very crisply drawn. If there were just 20 minutes of film to watch, this would be it for me. If you had ever been to such a wedding at such a time in our history, this film sends you back there with the fondest memories.This was a time of great confusion in America, and the Pennsylvania town presents a microcosm of the the spirit across the land. Too often films are set on the coasts to represent the passions of our culture. Here we have a story that draws everyone back to their personal experiences of early adulthood and the horrors of Vietnam. Characters have truly awkward experiences with each other, and communications among best friends become guarded, private and threatening. Deniro delivers an heroic performance in the pivotal role.

Mostly it stays on the iconic side, but only barely. The film is fairly ghastly in it's depiction of the Mental Health Industry in the 40s and 50s, and some of it is justified, but it becomes very apparent that the production has an axe to grind, an agenda to promote, and accuracy be damned. As a result, very very very very elaborate liberties are taken with the facts of Miss Farmer's life (That's a polite way of saying they lie like crazy in this film.) For instance, the centerpiece of the second half of the movie is that Frances had a lobotomy. She never did. The way the scene is filmed gives us the strong implication that we're supposed to believe that her soul died in that instant, though her body lingered on for several more decades. This is simply not true, and I feel it's a disservice to Frances to co-opt her into someone's personal propaganda war. Another instance we see her go on TV and talk about how her faith in Jesus pulled her through her hard times, and again we're given the impression that the real girl is long gone, she's been turned into a mere automaton. Again, this isn't true she never said this, she never did this, it's all made up. The movie is at least a half-hour too long, and it's very biased. I will say that Jessica Lange is brilliant in the movie, however, and fans will be impressed her tour de force here is clearly the high water mark of her career. In the end, though, this movie is not even remotely a real biography it's a 90% fictional 'decline and fall' story with an axe to grind watch it with caution.

Or, could it possibly be something much less typically simple (non-) minded than that, which is more popularly, normatively, thus alone unassailably reflected in what has happened, what we've all allowed to occur, to every one of us, and insist upon keeping that way? Perhaps it's the form, and not the content, of how he'd begun expressing himself? Well, then, maybe he should have just found a friend to talk to, or even a stranger on the street; one who would, no doubt, have sarcastically called him crazy, regardless of how calmly and sensibly he'd tried to share his feelings! In fact, far-too-many, if not most, instinctively interpret kindness as weakness and stupidity! About the only form of somebody's need to falsely or at least ignorantly but sincerely believe himself at all Christianly Compassionate, rather than much more predictably and viciously resentful, which he'd thereby have had even a small chance of encountering; would have undoubtedly assumed the conventionally and evasively falsifying expression of a suggestion that he see a psychiatrist, where the presupposition that he's the only one with the problem remains axiomatically supreme. At best, the psychiatrist might uncharacteristically concede, if he's sufficiently one-upped, that, while society itself unwittingly suffers from its own pseudo-collective form of psychosis, there's nothing anybody can do to change that, thus leaving the only realistically sane alternative that of adjusting to it, while antiseptically neutralizing the very reason why society itself could and even should consider changing, one real individual at a time, if not all of them, at once! . . . His wife was certainly not available, just as the film itself at least appears to presuppose that no account as to how the brutally-insensitive hostility in her attitude had come about needs to be offered, since the answer to that is allegedly right before the horrified eyes of the audience, which smugly assumes the way he's expressing himself to be nothing but the cause, rather than perhaps at least as decisively an effect of the fact that no other form of approach had ever made any constructive difference. In fact, try saying please, to the Devil, and his technique will often be to get your goat, so he can be the one to point the finger! The only thing which never self-vindicatingly comes into focus is the kind of man who just wants to see his daughter, or the kind of man whose reasons for feeling so dangerously perturbed should have been no less self-evidently and understandably revealing.

Or, what if he'd tried to share his thoughts on a web site such as this, about a similar kind of film; only to have received a long string of negative votes, and even complaints to the web site masters about how he's not sticking to an appropriately relevant or artistically non-controversial critique of the film; from many-too-many who are offended due to their unwillingness to handle any deeper, more meaningfully relevant kind of truth, and whose demands that the comments be deleted would thereafter be instantaneously honored? . . . I was going to say that such people are typically reflective of Hitler, in their spontaneously instinctive inclination to insist that anything they don't like be totally censored; particularly if their feeling is prevalent enough to where they know their demand would thereby alone be self-evidently vindicated, no questions asked, as well as very undemocratically minus any respect for perhaps even the many who would have appreciated a chance to read such comments. But, then, on second thought, perhaps even Hitler was also if not even primarily reacting, in spirit, to the very kind of people who would have unhesitatingly reacted, in precisely his way, to still others, who would have reacted, in exactly the same way, to them, had any one of them, from either category, simply had the chance Hitler did to do so, coupled with what Scarface called the guts to be what you want to be, which alone most so very virtuously, timidly, domesticatedly, albeit no less brutally, uncompromisingly, in attitude, lack.

Even Bible Believers incoherently forget that, when Paul and Peter speak of all the powers that be having been Divinely-Ordained, Hitler must thereby have been meant, too, at least for the duration of his tenure, and for a much better reason than that he had simply come out of nowhere,  to disrupt an otherwise Christianly Harmonious situation!

A Wedding party for Felix Lighter and his lovely young bride, all the while in the middle of hearing 'news' that a drug lord, named Franz Sanchez, that they have been watching is on the loose in the area, they set-up and scramble to grab him! After an eventful, fire fight with Sanchez's men, Franz, escapes, waving jovially at the law as he takes off in his Cessna. They manage with Bond's involvement to catch up to and 'collar' this banana republic, dealer. Sanchez, (Robert Davi) a mean looking and aggressive yet on the other hand sophisticated, even calm and at times mild mannered Cuban king-pin. They all return to the wedding party, minus Sanchez. But, before Felix can collect on the honeymoon, fun, he is betrayed by a fellow, department colleague. A rogue agent, Killifer, (Everett McGill) who gives a good 'hot' and then 'cold' performance.

Before sending him to America to investigate a Harlem pimp known as Mister Big he delivers some gadgets from Q-Branch, including a very useful watch. Q himself, or Major Boothroyd if you want to call him by his proper name, doesn't make any appearance in this one.Standing out like a Muslim in an airport, almost every single black person JB encounters in Harlem is on Mister Big's payroll. And they've got a seemingly endless bag of tricks to play on him. The funny thing about Moore is that he's very proper and British and doesn't think anything of walking into a tough Harlem bar while dressed up like the Duke of Edinburgh. His stunned reactions when they mess with his head are seriously funny.The action then moves to Lousiana and a savage Caribbean island as JB uncovers a massive heroin plot. There's a particularly long speedboat chase across a bayou where JB encounters Sheriff J.W. Pepper, the most stereotypical southern redneck ever. Think of Texas Businessman from The Simpsons and you get the idea. JB also gets to dodge a hundred hungry Gators and do, many times over, Solitaire, Mister Big's Tarot card reader.I'm not sure what kind of formidable villain uses a Tarot card reader to help him do business but when you also surround yourself with a hook-handed maniac called Tee-Hee, a quiet fat guy called Whisper and a seemingly unkillable voodoo high priest called Baron Samedi then you really do become a serious baddie. Right? He even goes on a big speech about how his master plan works before attempting to kill JB slowly. Obviously this makes much more sense than just shooting him right away.

It's with no embarrassment that I admit that comedy is my favorite movie genre and most of my favorite movies are comedies. What's more, when evaluating how good a comedy is, I give more weight to how funny it really is, rather than how well-acted or well-directed or even (much of the time) original it is. If it makes you laugh, then I feel it's done its job, and that's what matters.I'm simply saying all this because Young Frankenstein is not simply one of my favorite comedies ever; it is one of my favorite movies ever. I wrote a comment about Blazing Saddles where I mentioned the fact that it came out the same year as Young Frankenstein, and both movies had the same director (the GREAT Mel Brooks) and the same star (the INCOMPARABLE Gene Wilder, also co-writer). They also happen to both be among the funniest movies of all time, which is an incredible achievement.Between the two, I give the edge to Young Frankenstein; it's my favorite among Brooks's movies, and second only to Airplane! (by those other founding fathers of the spoof, Zucker Abrahams and Zucker) on my list of greatest comedies of all time. And this movie IS well-acted, well-directed, and (in its way) original. In fact, there's much to love about this movie besides how funny it is. But it also happens to be side-splittingly hilarious, and that's what gives it the edge over other comedies.The cast is led by Gene Wilder, who plays Dr. Frederick Frankenstein (pronounced FRONK-en-steen, so as to differentiate himself from his infamous grandfather). Frankenstein is a serious scientist who never went for his grandfather's kooky theories about reanimating the dead and resents the connection people make upon hearing his name. But when he finds out that his grandfather's castle has been left to him in his will, he is forced to take a trip out to Transylvania. In Transylvania he is met by Igor (who prefers to go by the pronunciation Eye-gor, but obviously only to mock his boss). Igor is the descendant of the original Dr. Frankenstein's servant, and comes to serve Frederick while he's in Transylvania. Played by Marty Feldman, he's the only character who seems fully aware of the goofiness all around him; he is comic relief in a movie that is already a comedy. And with those unbelievable eyes, all he had to do was look at the camera and he could get a laugh. RIP, Marty Feldman.Frederick also meets hot-blooded Inga (Teri Garr putting on a ridiculous German accent; hands down the best thing she's ever done PERIOD) upon his arrival, and they head to the castle where they meet Frau Blucher, the caretaker. Frau Blucher is played by Cloris Leachman, who of course is always funny. This sets up one of the best running gags in the movie; every time someone says her name, the horses whinny.At first, Frederick resists his grandfather's research. But after Inga wakes him up from a nightmare, they hear violin music, and find a secret passageway that leads to the original Frankenstein's laboratory. On the way down they also run into Igor, but don't find out who was playing the violin (which they do find, unattended and still warm, along with a smoldering cigar). They do, however, find Frederick's grandfather's notes (including a book titled How I Did It). Reading these notes, Frederick decides that bringing life to the dead could work after all, and sets to work digging up corpses and sending Igor for a brain (he breaks the one he was supposed to get and picks up an abnormal one instead). And so Frederick, Igor, and Inga set to work on their grand experiment.At first, it doesn't seem to work. But when the creature does finally come to life, it's a crazy monster. It escapes, the townspeople (led by Kenneth Mars as Inspector Kemp, and he is hilarious as usual) want to kill it, and they have to get it back.As I'm writing this, it is three days past Peter Boyle's death, and this is a pity. The world will be a bit less funny without him. He was pitch-perfect as the monster, making it every bit as much his own as Boris Karloff did in the original. He commented once that this was his favorite part of his. His ability getting laughs with just some exaggerated movements, subtle facial expressions and groans was without peer, and the bit where he and Frederick are on stage singing Puttin on the Ritz is among the funniest scenes in movie history.The cast is rounded out by Madeline Khan as Frederick's virginal fiancé Elizabeth. Madeline Khan was an extremely funny woman and although she doesn't have much screen time in this movie, she makes her time count. RIP, Madeline Khan.And Gene Hackman must be mentioned as well. I've always been a huge fan of Hackman's, and although his cameo as the blind man isn't his best part ever, it is his funniest, and makes for some of the funniest bits in the movie (Come back! I was going to make espresso! he yells out as the monster runs screaming from his house).What makes this movie work so well is that it almost seems to take itself seriously. It has an original plot that pays homage to the original Universal pictures with nearly every scene. It's shot in black-and-white, and everything, including the haunting score, Gothic cinematography, and set-pieces, many of which came from the original pictures, is meant to evoke Frankenstein movies of old. It's this hushed level of reverence to the originals juxtaposed with the hilariousness of the script and over-the-top performances of the actors that really sets this movie apart. It is a work of genius in every way.RIP, Peter Boyle, Oct 18 1935 - Dec 12 2006.

","genre":"Comedy"},{"date":"15 December 2006","score":"3 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" I'm a sucker for comedies. It's with no embarrassment that I admit that comedy is my favorite movie genre and most of my favorite movies are comedies. What's more, when evaluating how good a comedy is, I give more weight to how funny it really is, rather than how well-acted or well-directed or even (much of the time) original it is. If it makes you laugh, then I feel it's done its job, and that's what matters.I'm simply saying all this because Young Frankenstein is not simply one of my favorite comedies ever; it is one of my favorite movies ever. I wrote a comment about Blazing Saddles where I mentioned the fact that it came out the same year as Young Frankenstein, and both movies had the same director (the GREAT Mel Brooks) and the same star (the INCOMPARABLE Gene Wilder, also co-writer). They also happen to both be among the funniest movies of all time, which is an incredible achievement.Between the two, I give the edge to Young Frankenstein; it's my favorite among Brooks's movies, and second only to Airplane! (by those other founding fathers of the spoof, Zucker Abrahams and Zucker) on my list of greatest comedies of all time. And this movie IS well-acted, well-directed, and (in its way) original. In fact, there's much to love about this movie besides how funny it is. But it also happens to be side-splittingly hilarious, and that's what gives it the edge over other comedies.The cast is led by Gene Wilder, who plays Dr. Frederick Frankenstein (pronounced FRONK-en-steen, so as to differentiate himself from his infamous grandfather). Frankenstein is a serious scientist who never went for his grandfather's kooky theories about reanimating the dead and resents the connection people make upon hearing his name. But when he finds out that his grandfather's castle has been left to him in his will, he is forced to take a trip out to Transylvania. In Transylvania he is met by Igor (who prefers to go by the pronunciation Eye-gor, but obviously only to mock his boss). Igor is the descendant of the original Dr. Frankenstein's servant, and comes to serve Frederick while he's in Transylvania. Played by Marty Feldman, he's the only character who seems fully aware of the goofiness all around him; he is comic relief in a movie that is already a comedy. And with those unbelievable eyes, all he had to do was look at the camera and he could get a laugh. RIP, Marty Feldman.Frederick also meets hot-blooded Inga (Teri Garr putting on a ridiculous German accent; hands down the best thing she's ever done PERIOD) upon his arrival, and they head to the castle where they meet Frau Blucher, the caretaker. Frau Blucher is played by Cloris Leachman, who of course is always funny. This sets up one of the best running gags in the movie; every time someone says her name, the horses whinny.At first, Frederick resists his grandfather's research. But after Inga wakes him up from a nightmare, they hear violin music, and find a secret passageway that leads to the original Frankenstein's laboratory. On the way down they also run into Igor, but don't find out who was playing the violin (which they do find, unattended and still warm, along with a smoldering cigar). They do, however, find Frederick's grandfather's notes (including a book titled How I Did It). Reading these notes, Frederick decides that bringing life to the dead could work after all, and sets to work digging up corpses and sending Igor for a brain (he breaks the one he was supposed to get and picks up an abnormal one instead). And so Frederick, Igor, and Inga set to work on their grand experiment.At first, it doesn't seem to work. But when the creature does finally come to life, it's a crazy monster. It escapes, the townspeople (led by Kenneth Mars as Inspector Kemp, and he is hilarious as usual) want to kill it, and they have to get it back.As I'm writing this, it is three days past Peter Boyle's death, and this is a pity. The world will be a bit less funny without him. He was pitch-perfect as the monster, making it every bit as much his own as Boris Karloff did in the original. He commented once that this was his favorite part of his. His ability getting laughs with just some exaggerated movements, subtle facial expressions and groans was without peer, and the bit where he and Frederick are on stage singing Puttin on the Ritz is among the funniest scenes in movie history.The cast is rounded out by Madeline Khan as Frederick's virginal fiancé Elizabeth. Madeline Khan was an extremely funny woman and although she doesn't have much screen time in this movie, she makes her time count. RIP, Madeline Khan.And Gene Hackman must be mentioned as well. I've always been a huge fan of Hackman's, and although his cameo as the blind man isn't his best part ever, it is his funniest, and makes for some of the funniest bits in the movie (Come back! I was going to make espresso! he yells out as the monster runs screaming from his house).What makes this movie work so well is that it almost seems to take itself seriously. It has an original plot that pays homage to the original Universal pictures with nearly every scene. It's shot in black-and-white, and everything, including the haunting score, Gothic cinematography, and set-pieces, many of which came from the original pictures, is meant to evoke Frankenstein movies of old. It's this hushed level of reverence to the originals juxtaposed with the hilariousness of the script and over-the-top performances of the actors that really sets this movie apart. It is a work of genius in every way.RIP, Peter Boyle, Oct 18 1935 - Dec 12 2006. ","genre":"Comedy"}]
