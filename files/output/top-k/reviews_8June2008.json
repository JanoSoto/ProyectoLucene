Amazingly, the Blob still works as an 80's movie monster. If you have read the Stephen King-short story The Raft (or have seen the movie version in Creepshow 2), you'll get an idea of how this is going down. A slimy creature of unknown origin wraps around its prey - that would be us humans - and digests it alive. That makes for some very cool death scenes and some of the best make up-effects, the 80's had to offer. And hey, if they don't look so great sometimes (a scene with a young Erika Eleniak comes to mind), they are still great to laugh at.See, you can only win with this movie. You're either amused by how dated the haircuts and effects are, or you're blown away by the movies' sheer boldness to show all the killings in detail and to even kill off kids (in a scene which might be among the most memorable of the whole genre).Having spoken of Stephen King earlier Frank Darabont, director of King works such as The Mist and The Shawshank Redemption, has co-written the screenplay for this movie, which gives it that extra King-feeling (only it works a lot better than many actual King-adaptations do). Chuck Russell, the guy who had made the best A Nightmare On Elm Street-sequel just one year earlier, directed and Michael Hoenig wrote the eerie score.After an atmospheric intro, the movie starts off slow. The first few deaths may be a little disappointing, but soon The Blob gets some go. People start dying left and right, it becomes a downright massacre and after a big showdown we get one of those nice little cliffhangers, that were so prominent in 80's horror movies. And this one looks really great, like the final page of a comic book. Then the credits roll and some ridiculously bad 80's rock music kicks in. That's what I call a the perfect ending for a cheesy horror flick.As a whole The Blob isn't perfect, of course. It could have used some (deliberate) comedic relief instead of Kevin Dillon's constant straight face. In between the death scenes the movie slows down a bit too often, and the dialog is pretty lame for the most part.However, if you appreciate 80's horror movies, you will find a lot to love here.

I am flabbergasted, especially since I know and own the vastly superior Masterpiece Theater version starring Alex Kingston that is such a faithful and wonderful interpretation. (I highly recommend THAT version, if you can find it.

There are preposterous things that could have never happened in that century, which others have already gone into in their reviews, but the story and movie itself is not actually ALL that bad, and there is some excellent work by crew and cast...which is why I gave it some stars. The acting was superb, and the visuals and costuming were a real treat. Bravo to the actors and the costumers. Though overly sentimental and awkwardly structured, the story was serviceable and enjoyable, overall, too, if you allow a little liberty with the realities of the time period, and the ridiculous notion that the story was ordered to be told to the child.I do have a big complaint, as a visual artist myself, about the paintings that were supposedly the work of Moll's artist-husband. I hate to say, but the artists' paintings should have been much better executed. Though John Lynch's character was supposed to have been an artist who was struggling and always frustrated by his efforts, the execution of an trained artist of that time would have been more mechanically sophisticated, unless he was a primitive self-taught, which, given the well-heeled upbringing of the character, doesn't seem very likely, as lessons in the arts and sciences were common education for the wealthy of that period. The artist was meant to be struggling with the expression of the spirit and essence of the model, not the actual mechanics of the paintings. It is clear in the dialogue that he was struggling to express something finer and deeper about the model, which is more of a metaphysical matter. He says himself, when complimented on how good the painting is, that it is all mechanical. I believe the designer and the scenic artists sadly misinterpreted the intent of this part of the script, or they just did not have the capabilities or resources to produce the right sort of paintings, which, along with a certain clumsiness in the script, makes the whole premise fall flat.

It's just a great story that's very well-told.Eastwood's work as director here is excellent, although a couple of the action scenes, particularly the opening one, being pretty shoddy and borderline incoherent, but it's tightly-paced and fairly sophisticated visually, with warm, atmospheric photography by Bruce Surtees. Eastwood's handling of the film's tone is particularly notable, especially with something that is so often humorous yet such an intrinsically dark and serious story. There are many scenes with a wonderfully warm, welcoming air, and others that are just plain gruesome and disturbing, but the film never feels like a clash of tonalities. Eastwood also isn't afraid of variety. He'll go for a kinetic edge and make it work at times, but employs a minimalist approach at others.Of course, outside of the wonderful performances especially from Eastwood and Chief Dan George, the film's main attraction for me is the brilliant screenplay, an all-time great, by the wonderful Philip Kaufman and co-writer Sonia Chernus. It is a remarkably sophisticated treatment of the story's characters, themes, and plot, with a remarkable narrative momentum and some of the best dialogue ever written.

Being highly melodramatic, weakly plotted and poorly acted means Jedi fails to inspire at crucial times where Empire succeeded. Especially disappointing is Luke's confrontation with the Emperor, who in truth is a rather drab villain.On the up side is the fact that this digitally remastered version from ILM and Lucasfilm is a real treat when viewed on a widescreen in a theatre equipped for THX or Dolby\/Sony Digital Sound. Jedi features fantastic sound effects and some exciting action sequences.

Who? The writing credits are given to Gina Wenkos. Who? Actually Kevin Smith apparently did some work on the script, I hear. Anyway, there is only one name that matters in these credits. Jerry Bruckheimer. Of all the slick, commercial, featherweight productions this man has made, this one might be the most slick. And that's saying something. Coyote Ugly almost makes Days of Thunder look like Shawshank Redemption.That said, the movie is often rather entertaining. Much of the credit would seem to go to Piper Perabo who plays the main character. Her name is Violet, and she's just moved to New York to pursue a song writing career, but it seems like the big city will swallow her up before she ever gets her chance. She ends up taking a job at the bar of record, and the rest of the film details the ups and downs of her time there. It must be noted that Piper Perabo is not only beautiful, but quite charming and likable. As someone watching the movie, you really hope she succeeds. A bad casting choice here could have really given us a turkey of a film. The rest of the cast is spunky, and generally talented. Maria Bello shines as Lil, the owner of the bar. She is actually based on Lil Lovell who was the founder of the franchise. Adam Garcia shows some promise as the male lead, but its a thankless role. John Goodman adds some laughs and acting gravitas as Violet's dad. Tom Brady's baby momma Bridget Moynahan is there as a bitchy bartender. A chunky LeAnn Rimes plays herself in an ending scene. She also provides the vocals whenever Piper is singing. Tyra Banks isn't in it as much as you'd hope.There is not a shred of credibility in any situation we the audience are presented with. For example, the Coyote Ugly bar is about the rowdiest bar east of the Double Duece in Jasper, MO. Yet, there is only ONE bouncer who sits by the door and mostly just reads. Fights in this bar can be broken up simply by throwing a bucket of ice down on the crazy patrons. Violet lives in Chinatown, yet there are never any Asian people around. Kevin seems to be broke and has to do all kinds of odd jobs around town, yet he drives a huge gas-guzzling old car when public transportation would be the likely choice for such a person. Or how about the scene where Violet has just humiliated herself and is hiding out in the bathroom. Another bartender gal informs her that there is a guy at the bar asking about her. Asking for me?, Violet asks, completely stunned. Because obviously nobody in a bar full of drunk men would ever ask around about a hot new employee. Sure. But this film takes place in a magical dimension known as Bruckheimer Land, where the improbable is not just possible. It is demanded. You know, here's a big question..... since this film was such a hit, why was there never a sequel? Since 85% of all films released from Hollywood now are either a remake, sequel, or based on a comic book, why was no sequel for Coyote Ugly ever made.

As a result, it does not come across as an original or innovative idea. However, this is definitely not the only thing wrong with this disappointing feel-good extravaganza.First of all, there are some definite cast issues Macaulay Culkin is quite unbearably irritating as the cowardly Richard Tyler, a role that, in my opinion, would have benefited a lot from a more comic portrayal that would have made the audience relate to him more easily. Another annoying feature is Whoopi Goldberg as Tyler's animated literary companion, Fantasy. She is the wise-cracking character that you find very often in animated feature films, like the Genie from Aladdin (portrayed engagingly by Robin Williams), except that Goldberg, for all her talent, does not really have the extreme pathos that Williams had, and that the role requires. Patrick Stewart, the man with one of the greatest voices to ever grace the big screen, is somewhat wasted as the obligatory coward-who-thinks-he's-so-brave, Adventure, and although Frank Welker's Horror (the hunchbook) is amiable, the character still comes across as boringly formulaic, like the film. The cast's only real saving grace is the live-action Christopher Lloyd as Mr Dewey the librarian, not to mention the latter's animated alter-ego, the Pagemaster. As he so often is, Lloyd is brilliantly over the top. Otherwise, the only other interesting vocal contribution is that of Leonard Nimoy as Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, although his appearance is limited to a small cameo.Furthermore, the animation, for a modern day viewer, is not impressive enough to distract the audience from the dull plot, and neither is the dialogue, which falls flat (especially with Culkin's unenthusiastic delivery) and the gags are mostly grindingly facetious and unfunny (Would you like to crawl into a corner with a good book?). There is also a song in the middle of the film, Whatever You Imagine, written by Barry Mann, James Horner and Cynthia Weil, and performed by Wendy Moten. The song seems to be an attempt at capturing the Disney feel of incorporating Pop songs into the story-line. However, whether you like Disney's songs or not, you have to admire their talent for incorporating them into the plot, as can be seen in The Lion King (a film of which I, personally, am not tremendously fond) with Elton John and Tim Rices' Oscar-winning Can You Feel the Love Tonight, not to mention the other songs that they wrote for that film, all of which fit seamlessly into the plot. In The Pagemaster, no such cohesion between plot and music is achieved even minimally.However, although this film is mostly disappointing, not all is lost. The story, for all its flaws, wastes no time in getting started, and there is a certain nostalgia surrounding the film for the endless stream of, mostly mediocre, but still harmless, cartoons of the 90s, when computer-generated animation was yet to be exploited. The film does make a respectable attempt at being educational on the literary world, but some of the references are too fleeting (more Sherlock Holmes would not have gone amiss) while others were given too much emphasis, especially the Treasure Island segment, although Long John Silver is quite endearingly modeled on Robert Newton's classic portrayal of the character from the 1950 motion picture. Pixote Hunt, Maurice Hunt and Joe Johnston handle the direction skillfully, and, had the script and the story been polished up, this film just might have been passable. Having said that, I can't deny that, when I first saw the film, as a young boy, around ten odd years ago, I was sufficiently entertained, so it is definitely a good, innocent film to plant your children in front of if it's on television, but definitely not worth buying.

The Good #1.A great villain. #2.It was interesting to see Anakin's past, I enjoyed seeing his childhood. #3. Liam Neeson did a good job of acting as Qui Gon Jinn. #4. It was interesting to see what happened before parts 4, 5, and 6. The Bad #1. Jar Jar is the worst character in this movie. He is annoying. #2. Jake Lloyd does not do the best of acting as Anakin. #3. Horrible dialogue. #4. I want Yoda as a puppet, Not CGI. Overall It's OK, this my least favorite of the 6 films. If you have not seen it and you are expecting it to blow your mind away like Episodes 4, 5, and 6 did, then you will be very disappointed. My overall rating is 6 out of 10 stars. Enjoy.

A commonly persecuted and antagonized group of people are brought to life within this tragic dark comedy. While the film proves to be a dark realist film of disillusionment and unfulfilled expectations it does incorporate a magical element. Kusturica incorporates these elements in an off hand almost natural tone. I believe this does a lot for the film because it allows for an escape from the brutal realities of the gypsy life. The protagonist, Perhan, is continually used, mislead, and trampled upon. Through all this antagonism he proves resilient, consistently hopeful, and at times selfless. By no means is Perhan your typical good guy archetype but rather one attempting to survive in a very real cinematic world. Kusturica leaves the audience to answer many ambiguous questions at the end that allow for self meditation and unique conclusions. The director's ethnicity, Bosnian Muslim, allowed him to make the film in Romany, a rare language, which I also respect highly. As far as the title is concerned I am a strong supporter of its intended title, A Time for a Hanging, as it proves to be more appropriate (both in the actors real life and the films implications).

I being a photojournalist love documentary movies that show the real and untouched way people interact with each other. This movie though seems as a low budget movie shows that raw film style. It allowed people to be the characters without pulling away. These types of movies really draw you in and never let go until the end. Seeing how Andrea acted with his father and siblings goes to show that just because you have money and power doesn't mean you're happy. The black stain of child abuse can happen in any type of family situation, it doesn't play favorites. With the use of only a hand-held camera with available light and sound I don't believe anyone could improve this work of art, this mirror to life's artistry.
