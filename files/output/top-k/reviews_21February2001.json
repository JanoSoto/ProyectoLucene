Since the film was first released in 1999, the movie could not resist to throw in that little contrivance. What can you expect from a movie when its premise is based on the concept that once every thousand years if Satan impregnates a woman during the hour from 11 p.m. to 12 a.m. on the last day of the millennium, she will give birth to the anti-Christ who will bring the world to an end? I am already thinking that the movie is vulnerable to logic (is the time given in Eastern Standard?) and it will make its own limitations at the convenience of plot. End of Days is particularly graphic in its use of violence, but never really scares us, even with such a horrifying premise like the end of humanity. \tArnold Schwarzenegger has not made a good movie in a long time. First Jingle all the Way, then Batman & Robin, now we have a movie that bounces back and forth between action and concept. There are the standard action movie scenes, where a person sways from a helicopter in mid air, where a chase scene takes place at incredible heights, where someone grasps to a high window ledge, where a subway train crashes, where a massive fire erupts in Manhattan, and so on. There are also the false shocko moments followed with a sudden burst of loud, startling music the its just a cat scene, its just another cop scene, its just a dream scene, its just your imagination scene, he's not really dead scene, and its just maggots suddenly growing out of an apple scene. The movie is also bound by philosophy. The action is focused towards Schwarzenegger saving the world, but he cannot do that all by himself, can he? Sure he can, if he can stop Satan (Gabriel Bryne), from impregnating Christine (Robin Tunney), who was born under the religious sign of a passing comet -- and based on her birth twenty years earlier during the sighting of that comet &#150; is the chosen mother of Satan's child. \tEnd of Days begins with an intriguing, although plausible, premise. The bizarre events that transpire a few days before the end of the millennium immediately inspire our curiosity. The action sequences are also fine, intensified by thrilling music and a fast paced style. The movie opens on a good note, and the remainder of the action sequences are also quite exciting. The scenes also inspire a few questions. Satan kills many people in this movie, people just like the hero, so why doesn't he just finish Arnold Schwarzenegger off like he does with so many other characters. On the other side, Schwarzenegger shoots the devil, who pulls his shirt up so we can see the bullet holes immediately healing. When using a machine-gun, the ammunition flings the Prince of Darkness backward and puts him down before he attacks again. There are simply no rules to abide by here. \tEnd of Days does not have a whole lot of explanation; it plays sort of like your run of the mill action picture with the gimmick of the week. There just is not a lot of true involvement or engagement after the premise. We do care about Arnold Swarzzenegger's character, and Gabrial Bryne is an especially convincing Satan. He is devilish, with fiendish appeal, proving that tranquillity is the most terrifying evil. Al Pachino did an equally diabolical job in The Devils Advocate, but Bryne is even more terrifying. Robin Tunney has nothing to do but exchange shameless subtext with Schwarzenegger's character. (You're better than everyone else, just remember that. I don't want to be better or worse, I just want to be normal.) She is more of a plot device than an actual character.\tExcellent convincing set designs appear frequently, especially near the end where the characters wander through dark chambers and dim hallways.

I found some.The Blair Witch Project was, if nothing else, an interesting movie. Many people thought it was the most revolutionary movie of its time, due in no small part to the realism. Audiences found themselves believing every step of the movie. And, of course, the endless Internet hype didn't hurt. Many of us watched that film before the popular press piled on - and nothing kills a movie quicker than overhype. If critics tell you a movie's wonderful, your expectations are massive, sometimes insurmountable. This is perhaps why a lot of people I've talked to hated, hated, hated The Blair Witch Project. They illogically thought the movie would be the best thing ever created, even better than sliced bread, hot tubs, the Internet, or shoe horns. Imagine their disappointment when it was just a movie!That said, the sequel - which was made with a much, much bigger budget, was even more hyped, although not in the underground, independent-film style of its predecessor. Book of Shadows was marketed in a wide multimedia campaign, boasting of its shock value and of its relation to the first film.It has failed in every possible way to be entertaining.The story has a tour group prowling the forest around Burkittsville, Maryland, the site of the first film. The recovered videotape from the first movie has led to a huge influx of tourist to the area and its beleaguered residents. Naturally, people make money off the tourism, and a few give tours of the forest. The movie focuses on one of these tour groups, comprised of a couple of lovers, a couple of witches, and the arrogant SOB who's running the tour itself. These people couldn't get much more caricatured.Many years ago, William Castle held a nationwide casting call for a movie called 13 Ghosts. The movie wound up being one of the worst of its kind (a haunted-house mystery), and most of the very amateur actors in the movie never acted again. Book of Shadows does not have that level of professionalism or of thespian promise.Remember those cheesy movies - in the 60's, it was beach movies; in the 70's, it was biker movies; in the 80's, it was arcade game movies - that you and your pals laughed at and threw popcorn at? The acting was bad, the production was bad - you even got lucky some times and saw an errant microphone.The difference between those films and Book of Shadows is that this movie had a budget. But the acting is atrocious. Every line is delivered either flatly or with wild, over-the-top emotion. These kids have no idea how to act. They ACT like they're acting! Sure, you're saying, the original's actors weren't actually veteran actors, either. True, true, I concur, but those actors were playing their roles naturally, as if we were watching them voyeuristically. Book of Shadows didn't even attempt to do this. Much of Blair Witch was shot in black and white with handheld cameras - held BY the actors. Not this time. Professional cameramen held their expensive cameras while their decidedly amateur cast screwed up their deliveries. It's like going to an acting class for nonactors - people who can't act have a tendency to overact, to overplay, overenunciate, overindulge, and just plain overestimate the audience's capacity for dull, uninteresting crap.Then there's the effects. I could probably come up with better special effects on my tiny PC with one little graphic program. The editing was childish. The cinematography was below anyone's standards, even if one had a tiny budget. With a bigger budget, you would think better filming would take place. Au contraire!It's been a long time since I've seen a movie this horrid in every way. Oh, and the ending? I won't be dumb enough to give it out to you, but it's no mystery. This is a stunningly awful movie, content to make its bed in the den of The Blair Witch Project.

True, true, I concur, but those actors were playing their roles naturally, as if we were watching them voyeuristically. Book of Shadows didn't even attempt to do this. Much of Blair Witch was shot in black and white with handheld cameras - held BY the actors. Not this time. Professional cameramen held their expensive cameras while their decidedly amateur cast screwed up their deliveries. It's like going to an acting class for nonactors - people who can't act have a tendency to overact, to overplay, overenunciate, overindulge, and just plain overestimate the audience's capacity for dull, uninteresting crap.Then there's the effects. I could probably come up with better special effects on my tiny PC with one little graphic program. The editing was childish. The cinematography was below anyone's standards, even if one had a tiny budget. With a bigger budget, you would think better filming would take place.

Lee.  They wrote Inherit the Wind as a response to the threat to intellectual freedom presented by the anti-communist hysteria of the McCarthy era.  The movie depicts the famous Scopes trial where schoolteacher John T. Scopes in movie Bertram T. Cates (Dick York) was arrested in Hillsboro, Tennessee for teaching Darwin's theory of evolution, which was against state law.  The law forbade the teaching of any doctrine denying the divine creation of man as taught by the bible. The trial shows the confrontation between fundamentalist literal belief of the bible and people who believed the bible was allegory or myth. The attorney paid for by Baltimore journalist E.K. Hornbeck (Gene Kelly) for the defense was the famed trial lawyer Henry Drummond (Spencer Tracy) and the prosecutor was the orator and statesman Matthew Harrison Brady (Fredric March).  The trial is set to decide whether God's word or the word of science should be taught in school.Inherit the Wind does not purport to be a historically accurate depiction of the Scopes trial. The place names and names of trial participants have been changed.  The trial actually took place in Dayton, Tennessee not Hillsboro, Tennessee, but the carnival like atmosphere surrounding the trial did exist. The case should not have gone as far as it did, but it was a publicty stunt by the people of Dayton.  Lest there be any doubt, even the pattern of the names and the number of syllables in each name carefully match the real names of the people they purport to portray.  The prosecutor, Matthew Harrison Brady, represents William Jennings Bryan from the real event is portrayed as an almost comical fanatic who dramatically dies of a heart attack while attempting to deliver his summation in a chaotic courtroom. The Bryan actually died five days later after the trial ended of a cerebral hemorage not a `busted belly' as said in the movie.  Bryan had in fact run for president three times as said in the movie (1896, 1900, and 1908).  He was a democrat who appealed to the common man including many farmers and was the secretary of state before.  Fredric March's physical portrayal of the balding Bryan bears a striking resemblance as well.  Furthermore, Henry Drummond is actually the famed defense lawyer Clarence Darrow.  Darrow was a great defense attorney from Chicago who opposed the fyndamentalist beliefs of his rival Bryan.  He had been in many important cases in his years as an attorney but the Scopes trial was his last case.  Darrow is less cynical and biting than as his Drummond character he was shown.  In addition, the journalist E.K. Hornbeck from the Baltimore Herald is actually H.L. Menkein from the Baltimore Sun.  H.L. Menkein did work with the Baltimore Herald, but in 1906, he switched to the Baltimore Sun long before the Scopes Trial. Menkein was a great writer and and incredible intellectual.  He was accurately portrayed as a biting, sarcastic critic in the film.  As mentioned above, John T. Scopes is shown as Bertam T. Cates in the film. Scopes actually was not even a real teacher but rather a long-term substitute teacher instead.  After the trial he never taught school again and became a geologist.  In an effort to dramatize the movie several fictional characters were created, including a fundamentalist preacher, Reverand Jeremiah Brown, and his daughter, Rachel Brown, who is the fiancé of John Scopes. The townspeople of fictional Hillsboro are far more frenzied, mean-spirited, and ignorant than were the real denizens of Dayton.Some theatrical liberties were exercised in developing the plot but the courtroom screenplay was adapted word for word from the transcript of the Scopes trial.  The events that take place around the courtroom drama are largely fictional.  The movie begins with John Scopes getting caught teaching evolution and he is indicted for breaking the law against teaching evolution.  Scopes is immediately jailed and remains in jail throughout the trial.  Where as in reality no one ever intruded in John Scopes' classroom. Scopes was not kept in jail as shown and he only agreed to a trial because he thought it would be very low key.  The law that provided the basis for Scopes' arrest in Tennessee was the Butler Act.  The Butler Act was rarely enforced and was only an issue because the ACLU approached Scopes.  During the trial, it was in fact very hot and the people had fans.  The trial which went on for several weeks not just a few days as the film made it seem was moved outside to deal with the excessive heat.  Scopes was found guilty and ordered to pay a fine of one hundred dollars. Later, on appeal, the state Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the law but acquitted Scopes on the technicality that he had been fined excessively. The Butler Actwas finally repealed in 1967.  William Jennings Bryan died five days after the initial trial not on the courtroom floor as depicted in the film.  This was the first major trial that radio was a part of and the involvement of radio was accurately depicted in the movie.  The material culture was very accurate.  The suits, broad brimmed hats, and suspenders of the men were accurately depicted.  The wearing of shifty, loose dresses by the women was well done too.  The lawyers and men in the court did ask to take their coats off, as socially at the time the coat was an important component of men's clothes.  The film was very well produced and incorporates song components that better set the feeling for the time-period of the movie.Inherit the Wind in following closely on the heels of the McCarthy era, was very much an allegory of its time.  This dimension is fully exploited by Kramer and his screenwriters. Indeed, if he film can be faulted at all, it is on this level The townspeople seems a trifle too bigoted, while Drummond's unrelenting altruism is equally suspect.  Just the right degree of cynical detachment is brought to the pivotal role of E. K. Hornbeck without once sacrificing the empathy of the audience.  Kramer's version therefore, becomes an affirmation of the worth of all people, modernist, or fundamentalist, orthodox and progressive. Even the final scene is an attempt to downplay this cultural conflict and look for some consensus. As Drummond walks out of the courtroom, with the Bible and Darwin side by side in his briefcase, an old religious hymn begins to play. As `Glory, Glory Hallelujah' echoes throughout the courtroom, this atheist evolutionist, defender of the modernist viewpoint, seems more religious than ever.Technically this film was very sound.  The use of black and white color sets the audience in the early 20th century scene in the great South of America. Stanley Kreimer is quite a fine director with many movies to his credit and his talents were fully displayed in Inherit the Wind.  Using many visuals and signs throughout the length of the movie, the film is clear and easy to follow.Overall, I thought that Inherit the Wind is a very valuable film. It is not the most entertaining film for modern audiences but if you enjoy classic acting and a classic plot this film is definitely for you.  I feel that all students should view this movie at some point in time for their own educational purposes.  For to fully understand why they are learning certain ideas in school as opposed to others and the struggle that has insued to determine which ideas should be taught in our schools. This trial raised for the first time in people's mind the question of academic freedom of speech and may do the same for modern viewers facing similar problems with the educational system that conflict with their own personal beliefs.

The townspeople of fictional Hillsboro are far more frenzied, mean-spirited, and ignorant than were the real denizens of Dayton.Some theatrical liberties were exercised in developing the plot but the courtroom screenplay was adapted word for word from the transcript of the Scopes trial.  The events that take place around the courtroom drama are largely fictional.  The movie begins with John Scopes getting caught teaching evolution and he is indicted for breaking the law against teaching evolution.  Scopes is immediately jailed and remains in jail throughout the trial.  Where as in reality no one ever intruded in John Scopes' classroom. Scopes was not kept in jail as shown and he only agreed to a trial because he thought it would be very low key.  The law that provided the basis for Scopes' arrest in Tennessee was the Butler Act.  The Butler Act was rarely enforced and was only an issue because the ACLU approached Scopes.  During the trial, it was in fact very hot and the people had fans.  The trial which went on for several weeks not just a few days as the film made it seem was moved outside to deal with the excessive heat.  Scopes was found guilty and ordered to pay a fine of one hundred dollars. Later, on appeal, the state Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the law but acquitted Scopes on the technicality that he had been fined excessively. The Butler Actwas finally repealed in 1967.  William Jennings Bryan died five days after the initial trial not on the courtroom floor as depicted in the film.  This was the first major trial that radio was a part of and the involvement of radio was accurately depicted in the movie.  The material culture was very accurate.  The suits, broad brimmed hats, and suspenders of the men were accurately depicted.  The wearing of shifty, loose dresses by the women was well done too.  The lawyers and men in the court did ask to take their coats off, as socially at the time the coat was an important component of men's clothes.  The film was very well produced and incorporates song components that better set the feeling for the time-period of the movie.Inherit the Wind in following closely on the heels of the McCarthy era, was very much an allegory of its time.  This dimension is fully exploited by Kramer and his screenwriters. Indeed, if he film can be faulted at all, it is on this level The townspeople seems a trifle too bigoted, while Drummond's unrelenting altruism is equally suspect.  Just the right degree of cynical detachment is brought to the pivotal role of E. K. Hornbeck without once sacrificing the empathy of the audience.  Kramer's version therefore, becomes an affirmation of the worth of all people, modernist, or fundamentalist, orthodox and progressive. Even the final scene is an attempt to downplay this cultural conflict and look for some consensus. As Drummond walks out of the courtroom, with the Bible and Darwin side by side in his briefcase, an old religious hymn begins to play. As `Glory, Glory Hallelujah' echoes throughout the courtroom, this atheist evolutionist, defender of the modernist viewpoint, seems more religious than ever.Technically this film was very sound.  The use of black and white color sets the audience in the early 20th century scene in the great South of America. Stanley Kreimer is quite a fine director with many movies to his credit and his talents were fully displayed in Inherit the Wind.  Using many visuals and signs throughout the length of the movie, the film is clear and easy to follow.Overall, I thought that Inherit the Wind is a very valuable film. It is not the most entertaining film for modern audiences but if you enjoy classic acting and a classic plot this film is definitely for you.  I feel that all students should view this movie at some point in time for their own educational purposes.  For to fully understand why they are learning certain ideas in school as opposed to others and the struggle that has insued to determine which ideas should be taught in our schools. This trial raised for the first time in people's mind the question of academic freedom of speech and may do the same for modern viewers facing similar problems with the educational system that conflict with their own personal beliefs.

Lee.  They wrote Inherit the Wind as a response to the threat to intellectual freedom presented by the anti-communist hysteria of the McCarthy era.  The movie depicts the famous Scopes trial where schoolteacher John T. Scopes in movie Bertram T. Cates (Dick York) was arrested in Hillsboro, Tennessee for teaching Darwin's theory of evolution, which was against state law.  The law forbade the teaching of any doctrine denying the divine creation of man as taught by the bible. The trial shows the confrontation between fundamentalist literal belief of the bible and people who believed the bible was allegory or myth. The attorney paid for by Baltimore journalist E.K. Hornbeck (Gene Kelly) for the defense was the famed trial lawyer Henry Drummond (Spencer Tracy) and the prosecutor was the orator and statesman Matthew Harrison Brady (Fredric March).  The trial is set to decide whether God's word or the word of science should be taught in school.Inherit the Wind does not purport to be a historically accurate depiction of the Scopes trial. The place names and names of trial participants have been changed.  The trial actually took place in Dayton, Tennessee not Hillsboro, Tennessee, but the carnival like atmosphere surrounding the trial did exist. The case should not have gone as far as it did, but it was a publicty stunt by the people of Dayton.  Lest there be any doubt, even the pattern of the names and the number of syllables in each name carefully match the real names of the people they purport to portray.  The prosecutor, Matthew Harrison Brady, represents William Jennings Bryan from the real event is portrayed as an almost comical fanatic who dramatically dies of a heart attack while attempting to deliver his summation in a chaotic courtroom. The Bryan actually died five days later after the trial ended of a cerebral hemorage not a `busted belly' as said in the movie.  Bryan had in fact run for president three times as said in the movie (1896, 1900, and 1908).  He was a democrat who appealed to the common man including many farmers and was the secretary of state before.  Fredric March's physical portrayal of the balding Bryan bears a striking resemblance as well.  Furthermore, Henry Drummond is actually the famed defense lawyer Clarence Darrow.  Darrow was a great defense attorney from Chicago who opposed the fyndamentalist beliefs of his rival Bryan.  He had been in many important cases in his years as an attorney but the Scopes trial was his last case.  Darrow is less cynical and biting than as his Drummond character he was shown.  In addition, the journalist E.K. Hornbeck from the Baltimore Herald is actually H.L. Menkein from the Baltimore Sun.  H.L. Menkein did work with the Baltimore Herald, but in 1906, he switched to the Baltimore Sun long before the Scopes Trial. Menkein was a great writer and and incredible intellectual.  He was accurately portrayed as a biting, sarcastic critic in the film.  As mentioned above, John T. Scopes is shown as Bertam T. Cates in the film. Scopes actually was not even a real teacher but rather a long-term substitute teacher instead.  After the trial he never taught school again and became a geologist.

Matthew Broderick plays Colonel Robert Gould Shaw, the young white officer who led the black soldiers into battle.  Shaw is the son of well to do abolitionists hailed from Boston high society.  Glory is the story not only Colonel Shaw, but also of the black soldiers who laid down their lives to free their brothers from slavery.  Denzel Washington, Morgan Freeman, Lihmi Kennedy, and Andre Braughter lead the cast of black volunteers portrayed in the movie based on Shaw's letters to home and two books.  The movie introduces us to a handful of recruits and follows them from their enlistment to their climatic assault on Fort Wagner.Overall, this production is historically accurate.  In the film, all of the dates are correct in the scenes they are depicting.  In real life, Shaw did fight at Antietam where he suffered a small wound to the neck and was asked by Governor Andrew to lead the 54th Massachusetts, which was to be the Union's first all black enlisted regiment.  In the movie when he was asked this, he quickly decides that he does want to lead this group while in reality it took him some time to come to this conclusion.  In general, some slaves and many free blacks were enlisted in the 54th.  The training at Readville's Camp was fairly accurate in its portayal of the hard conditions the soldiers were put through except for the portrayal of an Irish drill sergeant which there is no record of anywhere.  The Confederacy did issue the proclamation stating that any blacks fighting and white commanding officers of blacks would be killed if captured, but all the men were aware of this when they enlisted in the army as it occurred a month earlier than portrayed in the movie.  The 54th Massachusetts was short of supplies but not especially shoes as depicted and they did leave to a parade in Boston. Furthermore, all of the movements of the 54th throughout the South were accurate.  Shaw's men did in fact quarrel with Colonel Montgomery's troops as shown, but Shaw and Montgomery actually got along fine unlike in the film.  The 54th Massachusetts saw action in the Battle of James Island as shown in defending the Confederates attacks.  Fort Wagner was portrayed well however, the attack occurred on wrong side, as the actual attack came from the south not the north as depicted in the movie.  The charge itself was well portayed except for that the flagbearer survived yet 281 of the 600 men in the 54th Massachusetts did wind up being killed, injured, or wounded in battle.  Going against the military etiguitte of the time, Shaw being an officer was buried in a mass grave with his black soldiers.  Dealing with the characterizations in the film, most of the black regiment members were composite characters who were not actual people but did repesent the thoughts and actions of the men in the 54th Massachusetts.  Frederick Douglas' sons served as the basis for the character of Thomas or the educated free black in the regiment.  The portrayal of Shaw was accurate and Shaw's assistant did exist but there is no record that he was a previous friend of Shaw's.  Throughout the Civil War, the hospital were overwhelmed and in horrible conditions as was the hospital scene in the movie at Anteitam.  Most of the nurses were untrained and did not use aniseptics causing many wounds to become infected nor were there blood transfussions. There were not many anesthesias available and whisky was often used as a substitute in the event of an amputation.  As it turns out you were far more likely to die from disease during the Civil War than from a bullet. Throughout the film, the American thirty-five star flag is accurate.  Yet the Confederate flag flown over Fort Wagner at the end of the film did not exist in addition to many of the confederate flags shown that were rectangular in shape when they actually were square.  The uniforms of both sides were well done in the film as were the boys marching in front of the units.  The guns in the film were historically accurate except for the portrayal of serial numbers on rifles, which at the time only existed on pistols.  The material culture overall was very well done though. Shoulder to shoulder fighting still was used at the time as shown but the weapons over time had become far more accurate causing many to perish during the Civil War.  The idea of having an all black regiment was largely unpopular with whites of the time.  Most thought that blacks would make bad soldiers, but the black men of the 54th proved themselves worthy in battle leading to the creation of many more all black units.  The etiquitte between enlisted men and officers was depicted with Shaw and Thomas during basic training when Shaw broke off a casual conversation that his friend Thomas was trying to hold with him because it was not proper to do so.  There is no evidence of any gospel session with the men the night before a battle but sessions like the one shown in the movie did occur on slave plantations from time to time.  Finally, as depicted blacks undoubtedly faced racial slurs in their efforts to participate in the Civil War.This film is a reflection of the values of the late 1980's and into the early 1990's when it was produced in the simple fact that there was a movie about black soldiers in the Civil War.  Blacks until recently were thought to have no part in the battles of the Civil War.  Glory opened people's eyes to broader horizons or views.  It showed that America and the study of history is now inclusive to all.  Where as once blacks were thought to have had no part in the Civil War a movie now depicts one of their shining triumphs in battle. Yet a recognizable message can still be seen when the director, Edward Zwick, chose to show a story about black soldiers through the perspective of a white man.  In this, it can be seen that however far Hollywood and America as a society have come in racial equality there are still many strides yet to be made before everyone in this nation is truly equal.Technically the film is very well done.  It includes graphic and stunningly choreographed scenes first at the Battle of Antietam and then in the stunning climactic scene at Fort Wagner.  It has been described as the most accurate re-creation of a Civil War battle ever throught its extensive attention to every painstaking detail.  The strong visuals in the film greatly add to the plot and help to set the emotion of the time period in helping to make the film more realistic to the viewer.Like any war film, Glory, has its share of violence and despair, but ultimately it proves to be a truly uplifting experience and an important history lesson.  It is a valuable viewing experinece that I would strongly recommend to mature teenagers and adults.  Glory serves as a valuable reminder that despite what history book say or rather what they don't say, blacks played a critically important role in the North's victory over the South in the Civil War, forever changing the evolution of America. ","genre":null},{"date":"21 February 2001","score":"","review":"  Glory directed by Edward Zwick is the true story of the 54th Regiment of Massachusetts, the first black fighting unit recruited by the North during the Civil War.  Matthew Broderick plays Colonel Robert Gould Shaw, the young white officer who led the black soldiers into battle.  Shaw is the son of well to do abolitionists hailed from Boston high society.  Glory is the story not only Colonel Shaw, but also of the black soldiers who laid down their lives to free their brothers from slavery.  Denzel Washington, Morgan Freeman, Lihmi Kennedy, and Andre Braughter lead the cast of black volunteers portrayed in the movie based on Shaw's letters to home and two books.  The movie introduces us to a handful of recruits and follows them from their enlistment to their climatic assault on Fort Wagner.Overall, this production is historically accurate.  In the film, all of the dates are correct in the scenes they are depicting.  In real life, Shaw did fight at Antietam where he suffered a small wound to the neck and was asked by Governor Andrew to lead the 54th Massachusetts, which was to be the Union's first all black enlisted regiment.  In the movie when he was asked this, he quickly decides that he does want to lead this group while in reality it took him some time to come to this conclusion.  In general, some slaves and many free blacks were enlisted in the 54th.  The training at Readville's Camp was fairly accurate in its portayal of the hard conditions the soldiers were put through except for the portrayal of an Irish drill sergeant which there is no record of anywhere.  The Confederacy did issue the proclamation stating that any blacks fighting and white commanding officers of blacks would be killed if captured, but all the men were aware of this when they enlisted in the army as it occurred a month earlier than portrayed in the movie.  The 54th Massachusetts was short of supplies but not especially shoes as depicted and they did leave to a parade in Boston. Furthermore, all of the movements of the 54th throughout the South were accurate.  Shaw's men did in fact quarrel with Colonel Montgomery's troops as shown, but Shaw and Montgomery actually got along fine unlike in the film.  The 54th Massachusetts saw action in the Battle of James Island as shown in defending the Confederates attacks.  Fort Wagner was portrayed well however, the attack occurred on wrong side, as the actual attack came from the south not the north as depicted in the movie.

Charming as James Mason played it in '62, Jeremy Irons won me over thoroughly as he seemed so genuine and so dastardly attractive, that I might be moved by him as well if I were 12 years old!  In retrospect, Mason seemed almost too old.  Irons also brings about a deeper sympathy for his Humbert in the same way Tony Perkins did for Norman in Psycho.  He is so adorable and sort of lost, that you've gotta like him!  Sue Lyons also seemed too old, in the '62 version, yet her aloofness and dated teen-aged ways charmed me, as did her recurring theme, which the '97 Lo (Dominique Swain) lacks.The matter of the sinister Clare Quilty (Frank Langella) **POSSIBLE SPOILER!*** is dealt with in a much more harrowing manner in the later film, and adds genuine drama to the story (WHO is this person, WHY don't we see his face clearly, WHY is he always in the background, etc.), and he is a thousand times more ominous than Peter Sellers' goofy characterization of same in '62.  As vulgar and frightening as Quilty is, I understand him and his motivations much better, and merely the fact that he is kept a dramatic secret until the latter part of the film is much more gratifying plot-wise. The back and forth flashback nature of Irons, his confrontation with Quilty, somehow add much more suspense than the almost amusing confrontation in the '62 version and the dreadfully serious latter third.  Somehow the continuity in the '97 version is maintained, perhaps *because* the humor is kept to a minimum in the first half?  An interesting debate.  **End Spoiler!**Also, the many delightful humorous moments in Kubrick's '62 version are done away with almost entirely in this picture.  The very sexually suggestive, Broad-Minded friends of Mrs. Haze, the Farlowes, are reduced to a mere mention; and there are none of the awkward social scenes, such as Mrs. Haze's constant flirting, the difficulty Humbert and Lolita encounter in checking into a Motel the first time, and the tedious scenes with the porter and that ridiculous cot.  If these elements (a scary Quilty, the humor, the cot, Winters as Charlotte and Irons as Humbert) were magically woven into one film, I would dance and dance, as it would then seem to me, perfect.I highly recommend BOTH pictures, however, for all the above mentioned favorable reasons.  The cinematography and period locales in the later film are stunningly photographed and historically accurate down to the period candy packages and road maps in the glove box, and the costumes, cars, the COLOR, and even the incidental radio-music works splendidly.  The shots of the nasty old coin-operated Magic Fingers unit in one of the many Motels along the way brought back fond, if not dreary, childhood vacation memories...A lovely film, but see both!

An ending that was too obvious for anyone to want to believe, SWEET NOVEMBER had a sour taste with it throughout the moment Nelson woke up in Sara's apartment the first day. Something I would have rather enjoyed cuddling up to with my angel at home on a boring day.

For me, Fincher is the most exciting director working in Hollywood today and has rarely put a foot wrong either in his technique or his script choices. Sean Penn is a maverick whose colourful life off screen adds barely needed interest value to some eclectic films and performances.A message to these two crew members Sean, I can't really blame you for the debacle that is the end result of this film, I just wish you'd expunge it from your CV. David, what were you doing? Unless it was the studio's decision to foist off that pathetic ending on the audience, you made a serious error of judgement; so far the only one in your otherwise brilliant career, but an error nonetheless. Here's hoping that The Panic Room will once more fully showcase the brilliance I've come to expect from yourself... Usually, a film has to have several bad points before I will stoop to awarding a '1' rating on IMDb, but this is one film where the ending is so inconceivably awful as to negate everything good that has gone before. Fincher does a neat line in edgy suspense and for most of the film this is showcased brilliantly. However, as I remember, this is quite a long film and towards the end my patience was stretched by the seeming lack of an impending payoff.

To say she gives the single most triumphant musical performance ever showcased on the silver screen could be close.  I am constantly bowled over with each viewing at how the 26-year-old Brooklyn novice ever pulled off this incredible stunt.  Cinderella playing Cinderella.  Even the finicky Hollywood powers-that-be, who NEVER use untried screen talent for such a weighty role (Julie Andrews and My Fair Lady come to mind), knew that nobody but Barbra could inhabit this part.  She won the Oscar, naturally, and it was befitting that the newcomer should share this honor with perhaps the greatest screen legend ever, Katharine Hepburn.Barbra's Fanny Brice first conquered Broadway where she lost the Tony award to another irrepressible talent, Carol Channing, for Hello Dolly!  She got her revenge of sorts years later when she won the coveted screen role of Dolly due strictly to her auspicious debut in Funny Girl.  Transferred to celluloid, the movie loosens its bustles quite a bit and grants more breathing room for Barbra to expand her natural comic and dramatic talents both keenly and intimately amid the elaborate sets and costumes. The timing of this film couldn't have been better for Streisand.  The late 60s ushered in a new legion of stars.  The rash of talent coming to the forefront purposely lacked the super-model good looks and incredibly-sculpted physiques of their predecessors.

She dragged out her own Cinderella version, making a virtue of her odd looks and gawky gait while laying out her two big trump cards -- she was a supreme song stylist and a gifted, self-deprecating cut-up. Hardly ever off screen, Streisand totally immerses herself in the role of chorus clown-turned-Ziegfeld headliner, weaving a spell around each and every song she touches.  From the stubbornly optimistic I'm the Greatest Star to the profoundly touching My Man, the actress matures Brice into the glowing swan of her own dreams, while exposing a deep, personal vulnerability she never recaptured (or allowed) again on screen -- to her detriment.Despite heavy critical lambasting, I still say exotically handsome Omar Sharif was indeed the consummate choice to play wanderlust husband and card shark Nicky Arnstein.  Polished, prideful and totally in his element as the global-gambling playboy, one can believe the ungainly Fanny (or Streisand, for that matter) placing this glossy god on a pedestal.  It may not appear to be much of a stretch (in real life, Sharif was a world-class bridge player), but he owns the part as much as delightful Kay Medford does as Brice's droll Jewish mama.

What may sound like a promising concept, five guys ripping off a casino during an Elvis convention, turns into an excerise in apathy.Unlike other Elvis-themed films (Honeymoon in Vegas, Finding Graceland, Mystery Train) that approach their subject with a geniune regard, 3K to Graceland seems to simply use Elvis as an excuse to put five thieves in jumpsuits, much like the Santa suits in Reindeer Games. The choice feels completely arbitrary as only the most obvious Elvis references are made.But arbitrary must be writer\/director Demian Lichtenstein's middle name. With most of his experience in music videos, Lichtenstein doesn't seem to know what to do with anything outside a three-minute format. His use of different film stock, ala Stone's Natural Born Killers, serves no purpose.Not that it matters, of course, since the script takes a good concept and drives it off a cliff within the first couple of minutes. The plot's indecisiveness ruins any and all threads that, if followed individually, might have saved this ill-measured mix of heist-road trip-action-comedy.As for the cast, Arquette is determined to typecast himself as the wacky 1-800-call-att guy and Slater continues to impersonate Jack Nicholson impersonation. And Costner still delievers his lines as if reading from a teleprompter. But blaming Costner would be like blaming a 2x4. Sure, it doesn't help the film, but it doesn't really harm it a whole lot either. Russell (It Happened at the World's Fair) actually does as well as he can with such a inscrutable film.As if all this were not enough, the score is awful. It's as if the filmmakers made a point of including as little Elvis music as possible. Just because it's been done before doesn't mean it won't work again. Elvis was a singer with an ample catalog of songs. There is no excuse for not using his music or, at the very least, covers of his music.Anyone giving this movie a positive review is obviously lying on behalf of the Promotions\/Marketing dept in charge of it.  ","genre":null},{"date":"21 February 2001","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  This film is a classic case of wasted potential. What may sound like a promising concept, five guys ripping off a casino during an Elvis convention, turns into an excerise in apathy.Unlike other Elvis-themed films (Honeymoon in Vegas, Finding Graceland, Mystery Train) that approach their subject with a geniune regard, 3K to Graceland seems to simply use Elvis as an excuse to put five thieves in jumpsuits, much like the Santa suits in Reindeer Games. The choice feels completely arbitrary as only the most obvious Elvis references are made.But arbitrary must be writer\/director Demian Lichtenstein's middle name. With most of his experience in music videos, Lichtenstein doesn't seem to know what to do with anything outside a three-minute format. His use of different film stock, ala Stone's Natural Born Killers, serves no purpose.Not that it matters, of course, since the script takes a good concept and drives it off a cliff within the first couple of minutes. The plot's indecisiveness ruins any and all threads that, if followed individually, might have saved this ill-measured mix of heist-road trip-action-comedy.As for the cast, Arquette is determined to typecast himself as the wacky 1-800-call-att guy and Slater continues to impersonate Jack Nicholson impersonation. And Costner still delievers his lines as if reading from a teleprompter. But blaming Costner would be like blaming a 2x4. Sure, it doesn't help the film, but it doesn't really harm it a whole lot either. Russell (It Happened at the World's Fair) actually does as well as he can with such a inscrutable film.As if all this were not enough, the score is awful.
