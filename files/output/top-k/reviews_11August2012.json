[{"date":"11 August 2012","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Supernova is the type of film that continues to boggle my mind, due to my curiosity on the production history that credits 3 directors, and a story that feels 30 minutes too short. As many have stated, Supernova revolves around a medical rescue team. After responding to a distress call some 3000 light year away, the crew rescue the mysterious caller\/survivor who eventually brings havoc upon the crew. Also there is alien plot that is used fairly well, albeit underdeveloped. Genuinely, I enjoy this film. With a generic horror plot, supernova actually is able to space itself from similar SciFi films, with its visually slick, clean, spacious futuristic metro sets, that are rarely seen in SciFi films. Also, I love Lloyd Aherns cool, almost colorless somewhat glossy cinematography. AS far as I understand about the history of it's troubled production Walter Hill replaced the original director, filmed the movie and worked on post production effects and editing before quitting. Hill, upset over the creative control he did not posses during and after filming, left the film half edited and up *shat* creek. The makers brought in quack director jack Shoulder to re-shoot what they wanted and lighten the films tone. Apparently Jack changed the ships A.I. computer Sweetie's voice to one sounding like a phone sex operator, as opposed to the female sounding Hal originally conceived. I assume, but not sure we can thank him for the minor comedic quips that felt tonally out of place. Sholder edited a different version with his and Hill's footage. It's unclear why, but Jack left, and desperate, the makers employed Francis Ford Coppola to allegedly re-shoot and reedit a final cut of his own. Supposedly Francis added the zero gravity sex science between James Spader and Angela Basset, who is REALLY a digitally darkened Robin Tunney , and Peter Facinelli. Finally, Voila you have Supernova, a decent SciFi horror\/thriller with no discernible director to credit. Had Walter completed his original version, as seen from deleted scenes, it could have possibly been the gritty, dark, unnerving experimental Science Fiction movie intended. Instead the viewer is relegated to it's subtle theme of Darwinism, the overt theme of human carnal desires and an A.I. computer capable of understanding love .....I know its a long shot but hopefully a blu- ray release will contain Hill's assembly cut.
