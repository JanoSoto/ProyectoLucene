The answer to the first question cannot possibly matter, unless perhaps it's part of an answer to the second; but while watching the film for the first time the second question, in the form of What can Phil do in order to escape?, preoccupied me, and I thought he was on the right track several times when he kidnapped and killed the groundhog, when he persuaded Rita to stay with him for the crucial hour, when he tried to save the life of the old tramp (who might, for all I knew, have been Father Time).I think there IS an answer, to both questions, and it is this Phil is trapped on the 2nd of February FOR NO REASON WHATEVER, and consequently there is no reason whatever for his escape. But let me consider the competing theories first.(1) Phil is reliving the same day again and again until he gets it right. If this is so he may very well have to repeat February 3 a few times, too.(2) Phil is trapped in order to become a better person, and so he is released when he has made up for lost time and done with Groundhog Day precisely as much as he ought to have done with the previous portion of his life.(3) Phil is reliving the same day until he exhausts all the possibilities, either of the day itself or of the position he is in.  This third hypothesis is a good description of what the film itself is doing - which is why it's such a great film.

(If mine is right, though, two things follow which feel right to me there was no need for Phil to have escaped at all, and the fact that he ends up with the not-particularly-interesting-or-lovable Rita in his arms was pure accident... even if he lives the rest of his life as though it wasn't.)

What I would call this piece of garbage is a waste of film and a major waste of a good idea. Deep Blue Sea illustrates the idea of sharks attacking an underwater facility much better than Jaws 3-and I hated Deep Blue Sea anyway.     Here's what happens. A huge theme park is about to open, and its main attraction is an undersea kingdom where people go to see fish and reefs (Like we've never heard that before). Soon, though, the doors to the undersea kingdom are mysteriously opened, and guess what happens to be in the area and swim inside? A harmless little sea otter? No. A shark! Soon afterward (after skipping sensual activity involving mike and shawn brody with their girlfriends) the shark is killing everybody in sight, but then mike's girl decides to capture the thing and keep it in captivity. Sounds great, huh? NOT! Soon, the shark somehow dies (go figure) and then before we're aware of anything else, another one (the first shark's mother) is attacking the undersea kingdom and destroying everything!     There are three major things that I thought could have made this movie much better the story, the characters, and the shark itself. The story was amazingly lame. It doesn't even take us back to Amity, and that was the highlight of the first two films. Even though it was probably a good idea to change the story and not just keep having the same plot over and over and over that the shark comes in, kills people, then Martin Brody (who was mysteriously absent from this film) destroys it, they shouldn't have started a whole new setting with new characters. And that leads me into the second part the characters. The first film had three stars playing great roles Robert Shaw, Richard Dreyfuss, and Roy Scheider as Quint, Hooper and Brody. As the second Jaws came about, only Scheider returned in the trio of great actors. And by the third movie he was gone. The only good actor in this movie was Dennis Quaid as Mike Brody. Tchh...and the last part was the rubber-I mean great white shark. But seriously, it looked so stupid I couldn't believe it.

Its incredible the amount of love and effort put into a film that's so mediocre. It is like the black sheep of the family, much like the Fredo in the Corleone family. There is a lot to like about this movie, but it just doesn't jell together.So, what's wrong? Well, I think one problem is that Coppola should have trusted his original instincts when it came to approaching this film. Coppola originally didn't even want to make this film have The Godfather in the title. All he wanted, was something conoctating that this was a film about Michael Corleone and his redemption. That's it. While this film is epic in scale, with elaborate set pieces and beautiful scenes, it would have been better to make this film a lot smaller, more personal. Just about all the scenes where Michael deals with his enemies, although they are entertaining, have a been there\/done that feel to them. They all feel like Coppola was trying to make an epic even greater than the first two films. Instead, he made a film that seemed strangely impersonal and distant (even though the true subject matter of this film is far from it).Case in point, take the first long scene, where we meet all the characters again in Michael's party celebrating his charity donations. In the first two films, the long opening scenes had a symbolic significance. The first film's wedding, demonstrated the great Italian cultural heiritage present in the Corleone life. The second film's party, showed Michael's continuing distance from his heiritage, through his acceptance and approval of typical American norms and behaviors. So, my question is, what significance does this first long scene in the third film have? It seems to me, that the only reason this was done, was just because it was done in the last two films. There's no need for a scene like this, it was well established in the last film that Michael destroyed his relationships in order to achieve absolute power. This film should have been about Michael trying to rekindle these fragile relationships (which, in a way it is). Therefore, the introduction of all these new characters, just get in the way of what the film is truly about.At least though, this first party scene is well filmed and entertaining. The final sequence, the typical montage of violent events that occurs in all these films, is so confusing and inept, that you kind of wonder if Coppola even cared about it.There are though, very many things to like about this film. It is pretty entertaining on a visceral level. I liked the villians of this film, they were well played, even though I feel that they were unnecessary to the story. Andy Garcia is wonderful as Sonny's bastard son, and Al Pacino and Diane Keaton are great together, and both give great performances. But...Man, Sophia Coppola is BAD. She is awful. Its strange, because she is such an important character. You have to give Coppola credit though, because she was a risk. By casting a nonactress in this role, Coppola was trying (I think) to show a person of complete innocence and their relationship with a father who they think the best of (which is far from the truth). She is like Jar Jar Binks in this way, a failure that is noble just because it was a risk, though misconceived she was. But, I wish I could say she was a bad actress, at least then there would be something to analyze. But she almost seems like an extra even when doing emotional lines. She doesn't even act, which is the worst thing you could ever say about a performance. I heard that Wyona Ryder was originally cast in this role. Obviously, that choice was a lot better, but what are you gonna do?Also, the actor that plays Michael's son fares little better. Its not really his fault though. The idea that he would become the star of an Italian opera, just getting out of school, is really ridiculous. Also, for a guy who's so important to the story, he sure has a small part! I wish there was some way they could have gotten Robert Duvall to come back, because Tom Hagen, really my favorite character in the whole Godfather saga, is sorely missed.Still, I'm giving this film a 6.

We all have different tastes, to be sure. From my perspective, I can only say that I did not care about these two brothers or their perceived calling to free the world from scum. They are pretentious and sanctimonious serial murderers who use religion to justify their crimes. Add into this mix a ridiculous subplot of a gay cross-dressing FBI agent and, well, what more needs to be said? Incidentally, I have not heard the F word used so much in a movie. I am not a prude, but this was so repetitive as to be abusive to the audience. If you like non-stop swearing, murdering, slow motion slaughter, straining to understand dialogue buried in Irish brogue, and attempts to rip off Tarantino's style then go ahead and sit through this turkey.

Do we really have to wait two hours for the happy ending that we all know is coming in the end? The scenes of Europe were nice, but hardly enough. Added to the problems of this movie is the fact that Matt Damon is just not that strong of actor, he seems to be void of any real charisma. The guy is plastic and unless you are a 14 year old girl, not worthy of your time. In this movie we get to see him kind of interact with a romantic interest, however it is tacked on and less than steamy. Talk about going through the motions.

But it was no good. John Williams' score sent those delightful shivers of nostalgia up my spine and by the time the familiar yellow scroller had faded into distant space I was lost in a heady mist of fanboy love.Sadly, it was not to last. After a brief set-up, we got our first glimpse of Anakin mk. 2. No longer the irritatingly chirpy Jake Lloyd, our Vader-in-making had transformed into the charisma vortex that is the supremely untalented Hayden Christensen. Consistently out-acted by the logs of wood burning in the fireside scene, Christensen walks around with an expression that says nothing more than I am concentrating very hard on remembering my next cue. In fact, he's so dismal he even sucks the life out of the usually lively Ewan MacGregor, who seems like he's become as disillusioned with Lucas as the rest of us. Portman manages moderately well, and as Mace Windu, Samuel L. Jackson does the usual badass schtick that we've seen him do in everything else. Even Christopher Lee seems stripped of his menace, possibly because most of his scenes consist of acting against green-screen - a tricky thing for even the most experienced of actors.The direction, too, is lame. Some action scenes (such as the hover-vehicle chase through a futuristic city right at the start) go on too long and become a tiresome showreel for ILM's CGI department, whilst others are cut horribly short (most notably the Obi-Wan\/Jango Fett battle scene, something us fanboys were drooling over before the movie). The battle scenes just fling computer animation all over the place and hope the audience will be suitably impressed, though the effect is rather like setting all your fireworks off at once - big bangs and lots of colour, but nothing to focus on.The pacing of the film is woeful too. The romance scenes take up too much screen time - something that wouldn't be quite so bad if the two leads didn't have the chemistry and electricity of wet cement - whilst the potential catharsis of Anakin's slaughter of a Sand People village happens off camera! Unbelievably during this last bit, we're treated to all the other characters talking about how something <i>really really interesting<\/i> is happening offscreen. Show not tell, Lucas! Even the lousiest director knows that.So many bad things, so few words to say it in Watto returns, except as an unbelievably offensive Jewish stereotype (big nose, long white hair, a black Rabbi hat). 3-CPO and R2 wander through the film, serving no purpose at all. The dialogue is ATROCIOUS and the jokes are worse. If CGI is so great these days why is it so obvious?Good things? Few and depressingly far between. The death sticks scene worked pretty well, the floaty thin white aliens were gorgeous and watching Yoda kick all kinds of arse made his battle scene with Christopher Lee the single most satisfying Star Wars moment of all time. Ever. Ever, ever, ever. But the brilliance of that last part (the only truly great bit in Episode II) only highlights the ham-fisted, amateurish trash that is the rest of the movie.I think the worst part of Epsiode II is that it confirms that Lucas really is just a hack. Without a Kaufman or a Kasdan to do all the hard work or a Spielberg to pick up the directorial slack, Lucas is just a big stupid kid telling big stupid stories. If Episode II were some other sci-fi franchise, I would regard it merely as an unbearably awful film.

In the literary version, Andrew's wish to become human is not linked to emotional attachment. That was Columbus' add-on. They probably thought Mmmmkay, now how would the audience really get the message that Andrew wants to be human, WITHOUT having to think too much? It seems that unless you create a romantic interest nowadays, the Hollywood moguls will think that their products will not raise interest from the masses. That will probably explain, also, movies like the 2001 remake of The Count of Monte-Cristo, which similarly ravage a literary gem, reducing it to a mere triangle, and putting love above all. Or why did the filmmakers ask the terribly corny Celine Dion to sing over the Bicentennial Man's credits, in a rip-off of the Titanic theme...The short story could've even made for a great legal thriller - in a sense, most of Andrew's existence is spent in courts, winning little by little the acknowledgment that he is a person. The sad part is that some of us will probably live to see such trials for good, in a few decades, and rather than pay hommage to Asimov's clairvoyance, we will have some hazy impressions of a soapy film.The implications were also fascinating. Asimov sees Andrew as backed up by a corporation If a man had died, the firm of Feingold and Martin lived, for a corporation does not die any more than a robot does. The firm had its directions and it followed them soullessly. By way of the trust and through the law firm, Andrew continued to be wealthy. His metamorphoses are gradual, and occur much slower than in the film - and they are not taking place in a makeshift lab, led by some maniacal, anti-social geek - another romantic cliche too dear to Hollywood, which simply cannot comprehend the idea that the Frankenstein image is dated...Here's another sample from Asimov's work Andrew says I have the shape of a human being and organs equivalent to those of a human being. My organs, in fact, are identical to some of those in a prosthetized human being. I have contributed artistically, literally, and scientifically to human culture as much as any human being now alive. What more can one ask? So, instead of spending his eternity courting a girl and making jealous scenes (like in the movie), Andrew actively makes the world a better place, acting in not just one (prosthetics), but several directions. Wow! Now, why wasn't that photogenic enough for Columbus and Co. ?Here's another example In the story, Andrew's lawyer tells him We've done two things, Andrew, both of which are good. First of all, we have established the fact that no number of artificial parts in the human body causes it to cease being a human body. Secondly, we have engaged public opinion in the question in such a way as to put it fiercely on the side of a broad interpretation of humanity, since there is not a human being in existence who does not hope for prosthetics if they will keep him alive. Now, these are issues that are becoming as important and striking as humanity itself. Some of those who still read books will remember that the French writer Vercors raised the same issues regarding the definition of humanity in one of his novels, Les animales denatures. These are truly important themes that need to be discussed much more than they are...Last but not least, the film embodies another Hollywood cliche, which I want to criticize harshly. Why is it that so many movies lately (meaning in the past 20 years), have been pedalling on the idea that death is inevitable, that it has to be embraced, that it is the order of things, and so on? The best - and ludicrous - example was the case of Cocoon 2 The Return, in which we were treated to similar ideas, but which simply demolished the original film and its characters. Why do filmmakers need to pound us over the head with the idea that even 200 years into the future will people choose to die after living the same 75 years as today? Do they think humans cannot produce and enrich their lives - and those of others -  while enjoying a longer span? Not to mention that, in this particular case, THIS BLATANTLY CONTRADICTS ASIMOV'S CENTRAL THEME! Andrew Martin helps people live longer so that they can enjoy life and be happy, and he is, in a sense, sacrificing himself, refusing to follow the same destiny which he brilliantly offered others, but dying happy, knowing that he was officially recognized as a man - while the film steals even this from him.These, and other shortcomings, make Bicentennial Man a cute movie, but one that is as forgettable as an episode of Friends. I wonder if Asimov would have approved of it. This film could have been a second Blade Runner, not your average silly Comedy\/Romance...  I guess those are choices that were made for us, by the men who tell us, through their on-screen characters, that To be human is to make mistakes.

The harshest comments often come from fans of the series-the same people one would expect to seek out the positive elements in the film.Much of the blame has fallen-unjustly-on the shoulders of Director Jean-Pierre Jeunet.  However, I must agree with those who fault Joss Whedon, who wrote the movie.  While his style of writing might lend itself well to his 'Buffy' franchise, it is somewhat a misfit in our Alien environment.As for those who voiced annoyance with the acting, specifically Winona Ryder's Annalee Call, all I can say is 'sorry'.  Personally I enjoyed her character the most.  Sigourney Weaver returns as Ripley.  The fact that this incarnation of Ripley isn't Ellen Ripley at all is where a lot of the criticism stems from.  I agree, this is not the Ripley of Aliens past, but I can appreciate the light hearted comments of one fan- `Well, at least she's got hair this time.' Bringing back Ripley as a human\/alien clone was simply a big risk that didn't pay off.  The supporting characters, like the movie, are enjoyed by some and hated by others.  I enjoy them, although I'll be the first to admit they're a far cry from the supporting characters of Aliens, the tough, callous and humorous Colonial Marines.Another large complaint was centred around the fact that the Aliens were over exposed, and this diminished their frightening aspect.  I don't believe that the Alien has been scary since the first movie.  In 'Aliens' the beasts receive much exposure, many of them being little more than fodder for the Marines. 'Alien 3' presents us with a lone monster, as the first, but by this time we're familiar with the Xenomorph anyway.  Are we not all familiar with the alien?  Its form has ascended into the sci-fi lexicon, a god among movie monsters.  To claim that Jeunet has taken away from the horror of the creature by exposing it is absurd There is nothing left to expose. Furthermore, the films attempt to create a new horrible creature-the alien\/human hybrid -left most fans largely unimpressed.  This tells us that they have come to the film with unrealistic demands to be horrified by a creature that was terrible decades ago, but has been made harmless by years of mainstream exposure in the form of video games, action figures, novels, comics books and parodies.'Alien' is a classic of suspense.  'Aliens' is Cameron at his best loud, flashy, unforgettable.  'Alien 3' is a respectable effort to keep the series firmly grounded in reality-after all, the sequel to 'Aliens' could have easily attempted to be louder, faster and flashier, resulting in a battle of absurd proportions between Human and Alien.  This is a fact overlooked by most fans, although, over time, David Fincher's vision is being accepted on a wider scale.  Where to go from here?  Fox decided Joss Whedon could write the story, after all, he was he was the man behind the success of televisions 'Buffy'.  Working from this script is Jean-Pierre Jeunet, who crafts a film as visually pleasing as the others in the series.  This, I feel, can not be denied.  While I am forced to agree with certain grievances that many fans have, I hardly feel that the film deserves the reaction it has received.  Fans should be pleased that every film in the series has been a theatrical release, and has not degenerated into the direct-to video market, as many sci-fi franchises do.What does the future hold for the Aliens series? Time will tell. Whatever happens, I feel that it must include Ripley, however that need not mean Siggy Weaver.  Personally, I think Hillary Swank would make an excellent Ellen Ripley.  Hopefully the series will solidify it's reign at the top of sci-fi horror, and continue to make us scream into the vacuum of space with terror and delight.

The harshest comments often come from fans of the series-the same people one would expect to seek out the positive elements in the film.Much of the blame has fallen-unjustly-on the shoulders of Director Jean-Pierre Jeunet.  However, I must agree with those who fault Joss Whedon, who wrote the movie.  While his style of writing might lend itself well to his 'Buffy' franchise, it is somewhat a misfit in our Alien environment.As for those who voiced annoyance with the acting, specifically Winona Ryder's Annalee Call, all I can say is 'sorry'.

As is the case with most movies that started out as books, the book was much better, but in the end, the movie is a decent carbon copy. It basically is that, besides the fact that they left out a lot of the story with Marcus' father and Marcus' budding relationship with Ellie. It seemed as tho they thought they had to Ellie in the movie somewhere so threw her in real quick and dropped it. That was disappointing, because I think Marcus' relationship with Ellie and the visit to his father's house was a big reason why he finally figured out that he would be okay. Aside from that, the movie had all the book had, and it was executed very well. I like Grant as Will, he did a really good job, and the kid who plays Marcus, I must admit I have no idea what his name is (Nick maybe?) was also very good. He has the role of Marcus down perfectly in my opinion, and he had a really good chemistry with Grant. Hugh Grant, despite the public embarassment he suffered some years ago is a really likeable guy, and a very likeable character for the most part, no matter what the role may be. He's cool and slick as Will, and it works.  Collette is perfect for the role of Marcus' mother. I honestly couldn't stand her in the movie, which was the point. She was annoying, too old fashioned, and very nerdy...perfect.  About A Boy is cute, it's funny, it's witty...In the end...it's entertaining.
