Worth watching if you're not otherwise engaged, but don't go out of your way to see it.WARNING &#150; SPOILERS AHEADMany have called this a story of a dysfunctional family. I tend to disagree. True, the parents are divorced &#150; but let's face it, that is very normal in current Western society. Other than this, the family members have a very healthy relationship. They bicker, tease and irritate each other on occasion like all families, but they also love and care deeply for each other.They are dysfunctional in society, not towards each other. They occupy a strata of society which is just beyond the edge of what many consider to be acceptable (or lawful). But the activities that would be beyond the pale in wider society are normal and natural in their own sub-culture.This attitude is realistically depicted in the movie. Thus, the 15-year-old Vivian (the main protagonist) has an on\/off boyfriend who is a full-time drug dealer. She is a minor who has sex with this (older) boyfriend because he is available when she decides to lose her virginity. She then leaves him without a backward glance at the end of the film. One brother smokes cannabis. A cousin, Rita (played by Marisa Tomei), has escaped from a clinic treating her for drug addiction. She is pregnant by a deadbeat casual boyfriend with whom she has lost contact. When she tells the boyfriend that she is pregnant he discards her completely. She subsequently attempts suicide. Her uncle (the father of the main character) takes her in partly as a means to extract monetary support from her father (his brother). Rita introduces Vivian (a minor) to her vibrator, and encourages her to borrow and use it. She does so, and this is shown (without any graphic detail) onscreen. Vivian stabs her uncle (with great force) in the thigh with a fork &#150; because he is being verbally unkind to her father during a meal.The movie portrays the sub-culture with sufficient skill that most viewers will treat much of this behaviour as acceptable in the context of the character's lives.The film has no real plot. It is a story of a short but eventful period in the life of the protagonist. This includes her sexual awakening, and a brief time during which her family experiences a taste of a better life (thanks to the money extracted by her father from his brother). Nothing earth-shattering happens, but many will find echoes of their own lives in at least some parts of the story. This, together with the good characterisations and acting, makes the movie a worthwhile experience.I have three main criticisms. They concern plot devices which really contribute nothing to the story. I consider their inclusion unnecessary at best, distracting at worst.First, the script makes a particular point of identifying the family as Jewish. Yet this fact, having been stated, is never made use of in the film. There is no reason they shouldn't be Jewish, of course &#150; but it is puzzling that so much was made of this fact when it was entirely irrelevant to the story.Second, there are (I believe) three close-up breast shots. They are so close-up that only the breasts can be seen, nothing else &#150; not even the neck or stomach. The inclusion of these shots jars with the rest of the film, which makes me wonder whether they were added in post-production to try and `juice-up' the movie. In fact, the effect is detrimental.Third, there is one scene in which the father, when comforting his niece (Rita) after her attempted suicide, commits an incestuous act. Specifically, he `cops a feel' by slipping his hand inside her top as she sits at his feet (she had given him no encouragement, and subsequently objects). This action is so totally out of character with the father's actions in the rest of the movie that it is simply unbelievable. Doubtless the intention was to shock and to intimate that any man, no matter how unlikely, may be a sexual abuser. But the actual effect is to intrude on the viewer's `suspension of disbelief' - this man would not have committed such an act.It also seemed a little pointless to set the movie in 1976 (pointed out by an caption which appears shortly after the opening credits have ended). Granted, the depicted society is such that the movie could not realistically have been set in any previous decade of the twentieth century. But no advantage whatsoever was taken from the chronological setting. Only the cars (VERY few in number), music and the clothes were specific to the era &#150; and all of these things could easily pass unnoticed to a viewer who was not paying full attention. The story could have been told equally well by placing it in the 80's, 90's or 00's. The only explanation for the &#145;70's setting seems to be that the story is supposedly semi-autobiographical. Presumably the writer (who was also the director) grew up in the &#145;70's.These criticisms are quite minor in relation to the rest of the film, which is entertaining in its way. There are some amusing scenes (the vibrator dance for example) but no real laugh-out-loud moments; the enjoyment lies mainly in the drama of these people's lives.This is perhaps more of a woman's movie than a man's, but not excessively so. It's worth giving it a try (unless you are likely to be offended by the sexual content or language). Most will quite enjoy this film.

My reasons for watching this movie were purely base and immoral and I'm sorry. I actually missed the first twenty minutes as I wrestled with London's public transport system to get home in time and lost. But, having caught up, I can now say that this film surprised me. What I expected was a so-so thriller with numerous and gratuitous lesbian scenes for good measure. Until I saw the name Wachowski and realised that what I actually got was a stylish so-so thriller with little sex. Damn!Actually, that's harsh. I did enjoy watching this film, possibly because it broke free from my expectations. I enjoyed Secretary for the same reasons - getting much more than I anticipated. The film revolves around the couple of Violet and Corky (Tilly and Gershon, respectively) who try to swindle the Mob of an awful lot of cash that Violet's partner Caeser (the excellent Pantoliano) is holding in his flat. What I found interesting was the mirroring effect between Tilly and Pantoliano. Just as the plan to steal the cash unravels, so too does Caesar's world as he becomes increasingly desperate to find the stolen money which, unbeknown to him, his lover has just stolen.The film runs more like a stage-play as most of the movie takes place in and around Caesar's apartment. A stage background might also explain occasional clunky dialogue, a problem which mars that other Wachowski film you may have heard of, The Matrix. The film is well shot, with cameras running along phone lines to other characters (for example) in a way which reminded me of Run, Lola, Run. What is it with the Wachowski brothers and phones? Gun battles are also used to show off directorial tricks, just as they were in The Matrix. Sadly, there are no scenes set in a dojo.The ultimate problem is that I just didn't care enough. The film never engages the viewer in any way, like a story-teller never peering over the pages at their audience. The film isn't terribly original either, with mobsters portrayed as little more than beefed-up Italian stereotypes. Tilly and Gershon are OK as the scheming pair (Gershon is more convincing, I think) but Joe Pantoliano steals the show as Caesar, the small-time crook with a big-time problem. He exudes barely-controlled malice, like Joe Pesci in Goodfellas but without the memory of his embarrassing appearance in the Lethal Weapon films to spoil it. He always seems to be a few seconds away from unspeakable violence and I couldn't tear my eyes away from him, unless he wasn't on screen of course.All things considered, Bound identified the Wachowski's as ones-to-watch. There is no doubt that the film is a playground for camera tricks but wrapped around a fairly ordinary and unoriginal story. Bound does have its flaws (doesn't every film?) but underneath the gloss is a good film trying to get out. I noticed that the average score (7.5 at the time of writing) is the source of some consternation on the forums.

Hugo's dad is the coach and becomes extremely jealous of O being the star player who everyone loves (I didn't, but thats not the point). He comes up with a first class idea to rid of his rival by using everyone around him, which have drastic consequences. First he uses Roger, A rich loser kid who has a crush on Desi, O's girlfriend. He uses him to wind up Michael, he gets into a fight, which result in Roger getting hurt and Michael not being allowed to play basketball. Then he uses Michael, desperate to play basketball again, he tells him Desi could put in a good word for him and maybe get back on the team, He and Desi become friendly, making O jealous. The plot unfolds. Hugo then stirs things up by telling O false rumors about Michael and Desi. He also uses Emily later on.Characters The whole movie just revolved around Odin (Phifer - the ONLY black guy in an entire school, yeah right). I didn't like him at all. I just kept hoping and wishing he would go away. But seem as the movie was named after him my hope was running low. I was so happy at the end though.Hugo (Hartnett) and Emily (Phoenix) didn't seem to say much through the movie, the longest convo's Hugo had was when he was trying to fill Odin's head with rage, which he did wonderfully. He used the same facial expressions and I couldn't really figure out what his problem was. I felt sorry for Emily through the whole film because she was such a mug and couldn't see she was being used by Hugo, who was, believe it or not, her boyfriend.It was a pity Julia Stiles (Desi) was in this movie, I dislike her the best of times when shes not trying to be this dazzling outstanding floozy.. My mistake, she always tries to do that, because she plays the SAME role in practically every film shes in, and O is no exception. She was great in 10 things I hate about you, I even like her in Wicked, but I hate watching movies where actors play roles that are so similar to those they've done before.Andrew Keegan (Michael) I'd hate to coin a phase but he seemed really.. gay. Not much to really say about him, he was boring and unappealing.

It took me three separate viewings to finally realize the genius of it all. I was not exactly impressed after seeing it for the first time on network television, after hearing so many good things about it. Then I stumbled into a theater playing Signs, and I was blown away by M. Night Shyamalan's directing style, and I decided to revisit The Sixth Sense again and again--and finally, all in one viewing, everything struck me as a wonderful, perfect whole.The film begins ominously in the cellar of a dark house. We see Anna Crowe (Olivia Williams) wander into the basement and grab a bottle of wine. We follow her upstairs where she finds her husband, Malcolm (Bruce Willis), drunk on rich wine and admiring his newly-acquired plaque, given to him by the city of Philadelphia in honor of his work in the field of child psychology. He thinks it would look good on the bathroom wall.Then everything falls apart. Malcolm is shot by an old kid whom he failed to help. Some number of months goes by before we meet up with Malcolm again, as he walks down a street in Philly, watching Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment). Cole has been having trouble at school. He seems to be haunted by something, but Malcolm is unable to place a finger on what's wrong.Then Cole tells him. He sees dead people. (They walk around like they don't even know they're dead.) Considering Cole a sort of do-over for that kid he failed to help so many years ago, Malcolm makes it his personal vendetta to get to the bottom of Cole's troubles, and perhaps even face the most terrifying of all realities the kid is telling the truth.John Travolta had Pulp Fiction and Willis had The Sixth Sense. This film reanimated Willis' somewhat faltering career, and for good reason it's one of his best performances. Sure, the fake wig gets a little tiring, but the mystery surrounding Malcolm and his interest in a patient will connect with most viewers. We're a lot like Malcolm, at first, trying to figure out what's wrong with the boy. Then, later on, we find out that we were really viewing everything through Cole's eyes.A major problem with movies about kids is that kids often can't act very well and rely on their cute, forced one-liners for audience approval. Not Haley Joel Osment (who was nominated for an Oscar due to this film). He actually acts, unlike most kids his age, which is refreshingly satisfying. He's no Macaulay Culkin--and I mean that in a good way.You may not be as scared by The Sixth Sense as you will be haunted. The movie connects with a primary fear of our inner psyches that we all experience starting as early as childhood the supernatural. A realm where rules of the mortals do not apply. There's a sort of satisfaction in knowing that only so many things can happen in this world that we live in. We know there's a limit as to what can appear before us, or what restrictions apply. But anything could be possible in a separate realm, and that is what most supernatural horrors miss. They mistake true nail-biting fear for creepy images of ghosts. M. Night Shyamalan doesn't. He strikes a chord with the audience by respecting them more than that.Shyamalan is a self-confessed Steven Spielberg fan, and also admitted that Spielberg was a huge influence on all his films. I'm not too terribly surprised. Indeed, The Sixth Sense carries a sort of elegant structure that some of Spielberg's early features such as Duel and JAWS contained--some sort of majesty about the curiosity of it all. We never saw the truck driver; we rarely saw the shark (and when we finally did it was truly startling); and here the supernatural overtones of the movie carry a sort of otherworldly mystery that this genre often lacks. I can see how The Sixth Sense may have been ample straight-to-video effort. A kid who sees ghosts. It's not exactly brilliantly conceived.But its execution and surprise ending (that almost everyone knows about by now and few actually guessed ahead of time) are what make The Sixth Sense something more than just another supernatural thriller. It's more of a tender, subtle character piece with spiritual overtones. Shyamalan has created an eerie second presence in the movie that is a lot scarier than showing ghosts parade about. Signs wasn't about aliens. The Sixth Sense, despite what people tell you, is not *really* about ghosts. I think that's part of what makes it engage the viewer, and seem so very intriguing, even to this day. After setting a groove for films of the genre to later follow (and knock-off), The Sixth Sense stands strong and proud and strikingly different. You have to admire both its ambition and respect for the audience, two fundamental elements of which are often lacking in many of today's motion pictures.5\/5 stars.- John Ulmer ","genre":null},{"date":"11 March 2004","score":"1 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":"  Some movies manage to scare us, and some movies manage to move us, and The Sixth Sense is a film that successfully does both.

How does a woman, seemingly fulfilled by happiness, react when that happiness is yanked away in one telling moment, in a car accident in which both her husband and her daughter pass away? That is the central understudy - a strong woman's attempts at finding purpose in the seeming absence of meaning.Mise-en-scene I watched an interview with Juliette Binoche, where she mentions that Kieslowski refused to make the film unless it had her in it. It's easy to see why. I can't imagine Bleu without Juliette - its not just that she lends her personality to the film...Bleu IS Binoche.I was thrown off by the sub-plots of the character's relationships with her mother and the striptease dancer, as I was about the seeming resolution at the end of the film. There were perhaps references that I missed but the 'almost happy' ending left me feeling un-relinquished. Given that I had shared such an intense journey with Julie, it seemed almost improper to accept that she would settle in to a normal relationship again.Cinematography The 1st shot of the film - that of a car tire racing - shot from the bottom of the moving car establishes this as 'not your typical movie'. The sequence-of-shots that follow eerily draw one into the compelling story-telling style of Krzysztof Kieslowski, minimalist in its approach, with a world communicated without dialogue in the first five minutes of the film.Blue is not your typical art-house film. Its production values are up there with the best, and the cinematography by Slavomir Idziak (who's craft was recognized by Hollywood in Black Hawk Down), is nothing short of stunning.The lighting is low key and soft, and wraps around the characters to create a mood of subtlety. A distinguishing feature is the detail in the shadows. None of the close-ups fully illuminate the protagonist, almost hinting at her vulnerability at facing the light, though the delicate use of eye-lights does well to bring alive her emotions.The camera, an intelligently used narrative element, interacts with Julie and partakes in her emotions, respecting them and yet accentuating their intensity as she plods on in an alien world of deep personal purposelessness. The tight close-ups penetrate her soul and force us to delve into Julie's mind and share in her agony.Editing deftly uses match on action to create irony while forwarding the narrative.Sound The pace is hauntingly slow and silence has been used compellingly. It screams with meaning and becomes one of the more important elements as the narrative progresses.Bleu is not a film you can watch, consume and move on. Either you'll feel that you've totally wasted your time and will probably not be able to sit through (the pivotal occurrence is over within the first five minutes of the film without a single world being spoken, and the rest of the film is essentially the protagonist's psychologically subjective journey) or you'll realize by the time you've reached the end that you'll revisit this film at various points in time, explore and read about it, discuss it with people you respect, and try to get closer to the essence of Kieslowski. For there are three now well-accepted truths about the folklore surrounding Kieslowski, whose reputation continues to mount posthumously...1. that Kieslowski carefully interwove elements that were rich with meaning and social irony, and 2. that figuring those elements out and appreciating their implications is probably a lifelong learning process and 3. that Krysztof Kieslowski is one of the finest filmmakers to have graced the cinematic world.Trois Couleurs Bleu is a masterpiece and the greatest exponent of human grief that i ever have and, probably, ever will see.

The sequence-of-shots that follow eerily draw one into the compelling story-telling style of Krzysztof Kieslowski, minimalist in its approach, with a world communicated without dialogue in the first five minutes of the film.Blue is not your typical art-house film. Its production values are up there with the best, and the cinematography by Slavomir Idziak (who's craft was recognized by Hollywood in Black Hawk Down), is nothing short of stunning.The lighting is low key and soft, and wraps around the characters to create a mood of subtlety. A distinguishing feature is the detail in the shadows. None of the close-ups fully illuminate the protagonist, almost hinting at her vulnerability at facing the light, though the delicate use of eye-lights does well to bring alive her emotions.The camera, an intelligently used narrative element, interacts with Julie and partakes in her emotions, respecting them and yet accentuating their intensity as she plods on in an alien world of deep personal purposelessness. The tight close-ups penetrate her soul and force us to delve into Julie's mind and share in her agony.Editing deftly uses match on action to create irony while forwarding the narrative.Sound The pace is hauntingly slow and silence has been used compellingly. It screams with meaning and becomes one of the more important elements as the narrative progresses.Bleu is not a film you can watch, consume and move on. Either you'll feel that you've totally wasted your time and will probably not be able to sit through (the pivotal occurrence is over within the first five minutes of the film without a single world being spoken, and the rest of the film is essentially the protagonist's psychologically subjective journey) or you'll realize by the time you've reached the end that you'll revisit this film at various points in time, explore and read about it, discuss it with people you respect, and try to get closer to the essence of Kieslowski. For there are three now well-accepted truths about the folklore surrounding Kieslowski, whose reputation continues to mount posthumously...1. that Kieslowski carefully interwove elements that were rich with meaning and social irony, and 2. that figuring those elements out and appreciating their implications is probably a lifelong learning process and 3. that Krysztof Kieslowski is one of the finest filmmakers to have graced the cinematic world.Trois Couleurs Bleu is a masterpiece and the greatest exponent of human grief that i ever have and, probably, ever will see.

How does a woman, seemingly fulfilled by happiness, react when that happiness is yanked away in one telling moment, in a car accident in which both her husband and her daughter pass away? That is the central understudy - a strong woman's attempts at finding purpose in the seeming absence of meaning.Mise-en-scene I watched an interview with Juliette Binoche, where she mentions that Kieslowski refused to make the film unless it had her in it. It's easy to see why. I can't imagine Bleu without Juliette - its not just that she lends her personality to the film...Bleu IS Binoche.I was thrown off by the sub-plots of the character's relationships with her mother and the striptease dancer, as I was about the seeming resolution at the end of the film.

The ideas of a rock star, a crazy existence full of puppets, 80s music, and a lost girl in a fantasy world all mixed together, seemed quite appealing to me (in a twisted way).  But this film almost failed me, because of its lack of a plot.  The tragedies of Labyrinth are the terrible script and cheesy acting.Of course, this is a KIDS' movie; those pictures are bound to be a little stupid for my tastes, but the film could have been so much better; more mysterious.  To me, Labyrinth is pretty average.  The one thing that saves it for me though, is the incredible David Bowie.  Though his acting in this is so-so, his appearance and songs make up for the juvenile elements of Labyrinth.David Bowie has a pretty odd place in the film though; he's a singing Goblin King with a major mullet, way too-tight pants, egotism, and somewhat of a crush on Sarah.  Yet, without these essentials, Labyrinth would be completely lost in a maze of itself, so to speak.The plot is weak because the connections between the characters are not realistic; there is too much emphasis on the technical details of the puppets and tacky sets, rather than the growth of characters.  Of course there are some changes in the characters, but their lines with each other are pretty stupid, with too many clichés.Jennifer Connelly's acting has an anxious (overacting) and sometimes, too happy energy, which really annoyed me.  Though, she was only 15 and perhaps pretty average in her acting, the whole personality still infuriated me. Sarah just didn't cut it for me, simple as that. The puppetry and effects are pretty good, especially for that 80s era. And since this is a Henson production, I'll give it credit for that reason too.Overall, Labyrinth is an `ok' film, but it makes me sad at how much potential this film had, yet it just couldn't completely pull through. Another thing, which I cannot stand about Labyrinth, is the conclusion; it was utterly pathetic in my eyes. Fans of David Bowie (such as myself) or fans of The Muppets will like this film and respect the creators, for their vision and good efforts.  You should see Labyrinth nevertheless.  You should expect to be humored and feel upbeat; just don't keep your hopes up for an epic fantasy.

Now with the release of the film on DVD I am still in awe of the precision and accuracy that it portrays of the atrocities committed by the Nazi's during the second world war.  Stephen Spielbergs decision to make the movie entirely in black and white was pure genius and shows why he he is as successful of a director as he is.  This film is such a departure from other films that Spielberg has made and is a testament to his sincere embracing of the storyline and content of the story.  While this film is long by most standards, nearly twice as long as most contemporary films, it does not drag and keeps the audience rapt attention.  It is the type of film which comes along once in a great while which truly captures the imagination of the audience.  The subject matter makes this film one which one truly cannot express as an enjoyable film, but on a higher level it is insightful and inspires one to really see how one person can truly change the world, at least their part of the world.  Oskar Schindler was a scheming war profiteer who had no interest in any part of world politics, the winds of war were blowing in his direction and he took full advantage of it.  As the war progressed and he became a witness to the horrific acts committed by the Nazi's against the Jews he became to see the Jews in a different light to what the political propaganda was saying and he developed a conscience which ultimately led him to expend vast sums of money in bribes and political favors to protect his workers in his factory, initially under the guise of needing to keep trained workers in his factory to maintain production, but eventually because he could see how his workers people were being made to suffer and were being brutally murdered simply because of a misguided political doctrine.  Acting in this movie is superb, Lliam Neeson was nominated for best actor for his portrayal of Oskar Schindler and ultimately lost the award to Tom Hanks portrayal of a dying HIV positive lawyer in Philadelphia, this was truly one of those times when the Academy had a very difficult decision to make as both actors justifiably deserved the award.  Ralph Fiennes was nominated as best supporting actor for his role as the homicidal concentration camp Kommindant Amon Goeth, he ultimately lost the award to Tommy Lee Jones for his work in the Fugitive.  Surprisingly one actor who did not receive a nomination, but should have would be Ben Kingsley who deservedly could easily have won the award for his portrayal of Jewish accountant Itzhak Stern who cooperated and assisted Oskar Schindler in running his Enamelware factory and ultimately used his intelligence to manipulate the system to encompass as many unskilled laborers as possible into Schindlers factory, persons who otherwise would have gone to the death camps as they were primarily musicians, writers and teachers, all who were considered high priority execution material by the Nazi regime.  This is a truly remarkable, emotional and moving film that will easily stand the test of time and remain a classic for years to come, it would be highly recommended and should be mandatory viewing material for all high school aged students who wish to graduate, as this film is not just a depiction of the events of World War II, but is also a reflection of the inner monster that lives within all mankind, hatred, and how there also lives within us a capacity to do great good for our fellow man.

The first time I saw Schwarzenegger's name I immediately knew he is the perfect man for the job.The best thing about The 6th Day is the performance of Schwarzenegger because he is not only an action star in this film but a dramatic actor as he combines these two talents to pull off one of his better performances of his career.Arnold did not make this film a hit by himself, he had a little help from his friends.

Dante's Peak won that race by a nose with it's release date coming in February, and Volcano's coming in April.  In the end it doesn't matter which film won the race as both are nothing more than a couple of tired old nags that belong in the glue factory.In the seventies Hollywood gave us a satchel full of Disaster films such as this.  Most of those were usually filled with an underwhelming all star cast placed smack dab in the middle of some impending doom whether it was jetliners with holes poked in them, skyscrapers lit up like a blow torch, overturned ocean liners, or earthquakes rocking the California coast.  In the nineties, we were still getting the disaster films, but the all-star has been casts seem to have been done away with. Instead we get a few well known cast members sleep walking through an exercise in how to survive nature's peril.  In Dante's Peak they throw Pierce Brosnan who is moonlighting from his 007 job along with Terminator cast off Linda Hamilton at us to gawk at.  Brosnan should have just taken the time off and Hamilton should have looked for another gig.Resident volcano expert Harry Dalton(Brosnan) comes to the town of Dante's Peak to find out whether or not the local volcano is still dormant or is ready to pop it's cork.  Harry, you see, was in love with another volcano expert he worked with who just loved to get up close and personal with them. Unfortunately for Harry, she gets bopped in the head during one such explosion and that's the end of her.  I have good theory as to why this was written into the story line.  It helps explain Brosnan's woeful unattached acting performance.  Since he's supposed to be moping over his lost love, he can now mope through the whole film and he excels at it.Linda Hamilton is the Mayor of Dante's Peak.  Unlike her character of Sarah Connor in the Terminator films who took action when things weren't looking too good, as Mayor and Widow Rachel Wando she does nothing much more than run around the mountainside looking worried and fretting about her kids and her mother-in-law who lives on the mountain.  The mother-in-law, Ruth, is played by Elizabeth Hoffman, and is supposed to be just like that guy who stuck around Mount St. Helens till the bitter end refusing to move from his home.  Here it just enables the writers to throw in the idiotic plot development where the kids and Rachel have to go and rescue her just as Dante's Peak is spewing ash and lava all over the countryside.  It's supposed to add suspense and excitement, but only serves to up the stupid level.  For one thing, Ruth is annoying enough that we don't care whether she is rescued or not, and second, the two kids (Jamie Renée Smith and Jeremy Foley) have a high annoyance level of their own and we end up rooting for Dante's Peak instead of them.One thing they have held over from the disaster films of the seventies is the terrible on screen chemistry of the two main love interests (see Charlton Heston and Karen Black in Airport 1975, Charlton Heston and Genevieve Bujold\/Ava Gardner in Earthquake, Paul Newman and Faye Dunaway in The Towering Inferno, Jack Lemmon and Brenda Vaccaro in Airport 1979).  I can understand that it can be difficult to develop a love interest when certain doom is clouding the horizon, but I'm of the impression that if Harry and Rachel were to meet under normal circumstances they would shake each other's hands and be on their way.There are truly some ridiculous scenes in this film.  These are the moments we would usually just overlook and go on if we were at least being entertained somewhat by the proceedings but since we are not, they stand out like the Rock of Gibraltar.  We get people in a jeep riding a lava flow, Pierce Brosnan paddling a boat with his hand in an acid filled lake and not being any worse the wear for it, we get a couple of cute dog moments, we get a ridiculous scene of our cast trying to outrun a cloud of ash in a jeep and so forth and so on.Also on hand is Charles Hallahan as Brosnan's doubting Thomas boss Paul Dreyfuss who is made to believe in the eruption only when it's too late to do anything about it.  There's always one such character in these types of films, but at least Hallahan's doubts come from logical assumptions instead of the blatant idiocy usually given these characters.  At least that was refreshing if nothing else is.There is nothing about Dante's Peak that you'll believe for one second. Everything about it is below par, and not worth one second of your time. If you want to watch a volcano in action, I suggest reading something about Mount St. Helens.

It tries to be intelligent, informed and political but its lofty ambitions add up to delusions of grandeur.  It wears a dunce's hat and wants us to think it's a crown.Michael Faraday (Jeff Bridges) is having trouble coming to terms with the loss of his wife, an FBI agent killed some years earlier in a botched raid.  He's banging one of his graduate students but his heart's not in it.  He teaches American history, specifically the history of American terrorism, and begins to suspect his neighbour is a terrorist.  It's quite a coincidence.  It's the first of many.Tim Robbins and Joan Cusack play Your Next Door Neighbours.  They're blandly suburban, they have barbecues and dinner parties, their kids play Little League baseball.  You can bet they own Tupperware.  They're supposed to make us question what lies beneath the surface of the people with whom we share our streets.  Every serial killer, every rapist, every burglar and insurance fraudster lives somewhere, lives next to someone.  And there's something fishy about these people.  Their kid blew up his hand playing with fireworks.  Robbins says he's an architect working on a mall but has blueprints for an office building.  And he calls himself Lang but has been getting letters addressed to a Mr Fenimore.  Are these people really terrorists, or are Faraday's grief and expertise leading him to paranoid delusions?In most thrillers we'd be given some signs of ambiguity, clues that lead nowhere, red herrings that frustrate us.  But this is a strangely one-sided film that leaves little doubt in our minds.  After all, if Bridges were wrong what would be the finale?  Him taking a basket of fruit over the road and saying `My mistake!'The film flirts with serious issues, plays with politics and extremism but seems uninterested in their depths.  It needs to find a way of teaching us about terrorism and does so by literally teaching us about terrorism!  We sit in on the rambling lectures given by Faraday, we're told facts here and there &#150; most of them invented &#150; but learn little.  We're given statistics, profiles of terrorists, conspiracy theories that add up to precisely nothing.  We're not told anything about the motivations of anti-government groups.  We don't discuss their beliefs; we just condemn their actions.  The film's interest in terrorism is superficial, just a hook on which to hang a limp thriller.  It flirts with issues, certainly, but only because they'll take us to a car chase and a fight scene.Beyond its one-sided are-they\/aren't-they\/of-course-they-are plotting and its dunderheaded struggles with politics, the film lacks credibility because of its reliance on coincidence.  It's a big enough coincidence having a terrorist living across the road from a professor of terrorism but worse is yet to come.  Faraday searches through old newspapers to get background on his neighbour, while his neighbour sneaks up behind him in the background.  Faraday's girlfriend parks her car and sees her neighbour in the same car park trading briefcases and vehicles with a stranger.  She follows him, finds a payphone and calls Faraday to report what she's seen, turns around and is face to face with the neighbour's wife.  These people get everywhere!  They're not the Langs, they're Mr and Mrs Droopy!There is a twist towards the end of the film that goes some way to explaining the coincidences and contrivances that come before it, but it rubbishes everything that follows.  You look at the film one way and it doesn't make much sense.  You look at it another way and see just a different kind of nonsense.  Somehow it pulls a great finale out of nowhere, one that makes you think better of the film until you remember that, actually, it wasn't out of nowhere &#150; it was from The Parallax View.It's a strange film.  It's not awful, its cast is as good as you'd expect and the direction is fine.  Had it shown more modesty it could have been a solid (if disposable) movie but it wants things that are beyond its reach and ends up looking... silly.  It's just a silly film.

We're given statistics, profiles of terrorists, conspiracy theories that add up to precisely nothing.  We're not told anything about the motivations of anti-government groups.

It flirts with issues, certainly, but only because they'll take us to a car chase and a fight scene.Beyond its one-sided are-they\/aren't-they\/of-course-they-are plotting and its dunderheaded struggles with politics, the film lacks credibility because of its reliance on coincidence.  It's a big enough coincidence having a terrorist living across the road from a professor of terrorism but worse is yet to come.  Faraday searches through old newspapers to get background on his neighbour, while his neighbour sneaks up behind him in the background.  Faraday's girlfriend parks her car and sees her neighbour in the same car park trading briefcases and vehicles with a stranger.  She follows him, finds a payphone and calls Faraday to report what she's seen, turns around and is face to face with the neighbour's wife.  These people get everywhere!  They're not the Langs, they're Mr and Mrs Droopy!There is a twist towards the end of the film that goes some way to explaining the coincidences and contrivances that come before it, but it rubbishes everything that follows.  You look at the film one way and it doesn't make much sense.  You look at it another way and see just a different kind of nonsense.  Somehow it pulls a great finale out of nowhere, one that makes you think better of the film until you remember that, actually, it wasn't out of nowhere &#150; it was from The Parallax View.It's a strange film.  It's not awful, its cast is as good as you'd expect and the direction is fine.

It tries to be intelligent, informed and political but its lofty ambitions add up to delusions of grandeur.  It wears a dunce's hat and wants us to think it's a crown.Michael Faraday (Jeff Bridges) is having trouble coming to terms with the loss of his wife, an FBI agent killed some years earlier in a botched raid.  He's banging one of his graduate students but his heart's not in it.  He teaches American history, specifically the history of American terrorism, and begins to suspect his neighbour is a terrorist.  It's quite a coincidence.  It's the first of many.Tim Robbins and Joan Cusack play Your Next Door Neighbours.  They're blandly suburban, they have barbecues and dinner parties, their kids play Little League baseball.  You can bet they own Tupperware.  They're supposed to make us question what lies beneath the surface of the people with whom we share our streets.  Every serial killer, every rapist, every burglar and insurance fraudster lives somewhere, lives next to someone.  And there's something fishy about these people.  Their kid blew up his hand playing with fireworks.  Robbins says he's an architect working on a mall but has blueprints for an office building.  And he calls himself Lang but has been getting letters addressed to a Mr Fenimore.  Are these people really terrorists, or are Faraday's grief and expertise leading him to paranoid delusions?In most thrillers we'd be given some signs of ambiguity, clues that lead nowhere, red herrings that frustrate us.  But this is a strangely one-sided film that leaves little doubt in our minds.  After all, if Bridges were wrong what would be the finale?  Him taking a basket of fruit over the road and saying `My mistake!'The film flirts with serious issues, plays with politics and extremism but seems uninterested in their depths.  It needs to find a way of teaching us about terrorism and does so by literally teaching us about terrorism!

Long feature films telling three separate tales that mix humor and horror. The Monster Club was the last one and I can't really say I'm sorry for that. I didn't enjoy this film at all since it only has a few good moments and even those aren't highly memorable. Two absolute legends in the field provide the Monster Club with a silly wraparound story.

Let's start with the worst news first the second story is really stupid and a complete waste of Donald Pleasance's horror talent. It's a very boring vampire-tale that's neither scary.nor funny. The first and last stories are watchable, yet the quality level never surpasses your average 'Tales from the Crypt' episode or something. The reasons why these fables are more or less interesting are because they introduce interesting variants on the common monsters. The protagonists are for example a Shadmock and a Humghoul! This last one is a result of sex between a ghoul and a human being! The gruesome make-up effects are limited and the direction is really crappy. Which is really surprising since Roy Ward Baker did a few outstanding directing jobs in the past. For instance, Dr. Jeckyll and Sister Hyde and Quartermass and the Pit for the Hammer Studio's. Vincent Price looks so tired and fed up that he almost becomes pitiful.yet he still manages to ramble a funny monologue near the end. The whole thing is completely ruined by bad (and too much) pop\/rock music that form yet another connection between the stories. The only sequence that is really worth mentioning is a female stripper that goes all the way.and I do mean ALL the way.

Sadly, it doesn't hold much in the way of mystery or intrigue. Hackman is very good as the hardened captain, and the pairing with Washington provides a believable contrast around which the dueling of their characters is based. Aside from the tension that is built through the plot (a formula which is fairly predictable and has been used to better effect in other sub movies), the real core of Crimson Tide lies in the interplay between Hackman and Washington, and the powerful clashes between them. Denzel Washington is outstanding as the educated, calm and conscientious officer, playing his character with delicate understatement reminiscent of Michael Cain in 'Zulu' (1964).* Possible Spoiler Plot outline * Unfortunately, the plot often sacrifices credibility for tension. The scenario of renegade Russians with nukes is thrust upon the viewer in the opening scene, and develops into a classic Defcon 2 situation too quickly, with not enough background development as to the situation. The effect is that the entire plot, and the gravity of the situation, is a little difficult to believe. Given that Hackman overtly makes a comparison with the Cuban Missile Crisis, it is hard for the viewer to imagine a typical Cold War situation taking place after the Cold War. In this respect, it almost seemed as if the screenplay had been written during the Cold War but had been put on hold, and loosely adapted to fit the mid-1990s period. I can't help wondering that the entire movie would have been for more believable if it had been set sometime in the early 1980s, as a classic Cold War submarine flick.* Possible Spoiler Ending * The most disappointing part of the film, however, is in the epilogue. Hackman and Washington's characters part with a cheesy 'no hard feelings' salute of mutual respect, when only a few minutes before they had been ready to shoot each other.However, this is still a pretty good fast-paced action thriller if you are able to ignore these slight disappointments. Hans Zimmer provides a score that keeps the adrenaline flowing, and there are some good effects as you would expect from a Bruckheimer film. The suspense is not quite as good as 'The Hunt for Red October' (1990), while the cinematography doesn't compare at all with 'Das Boot' (1981) (although there is a remarkably similar scene here in which the sub is sinking out of control). However the acting is top quality, going a long way to save the film from its flaws; in particular, the clashes between Captain and Officer is almost as powerful as between Clark Gable and Burt Lancaster in 'Run Silent, Run Deep' (1958).Final score 6 out of 10.
