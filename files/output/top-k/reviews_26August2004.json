The only reason i watched this one is because i ran out of action movies. In the end i was absolutely blown away by the beautiful story. No movie has ever gotten to me like this before! I actually came close to crying at various points in the movie and that is a first, and i am no 10-yr old teenage girl. This is a movie for all people.The beginning of the film was fairly close to that typical full-of-hormone teen movie and i was beginning to get upset. But as i watched on i realized that it lacked the usual corny storyline and dialog. Instead i found a wonderful love story done masterfully by Mandy Moore and Shane West. The movie is sincere and touching, the characters are realistic and believable. Every scene in the movie has a purpose, unlike in some other ones i feel like people are shooting scenes just for the sake of filling time. I have to praise the acting of the leading characters again here because they really made this great movie become even more unforgettable. I can tell that the lines come from the bottom of their hearts mixed with emotion, not just memorized from the script and read out as done in some other films (i don't want to mention names here). The changing relationship between Jamie and Landon is just heartwarming. When the sad news came it got even more touching. I also realized that the seemingly bad beginning is there to show how powerful true love can be (to completely transfer a character 360 degrees). One place in the movie where i THINK some MAY think is cliché is Landon's friends (especially the guy who ate Landon's fist) all becoming supportive of him. However given the circumstances of the storyline, only people with stone hearts won't do that. At the end of the movie i was left in my seat stunned, my mind can't think of anything except replaying scenes from the movie. This is truly a great different movie-seeing experience for me, and my rating for it is 10\/10. Yes, 10, a rating i only gave before to mega-blockbusters like LOTR and The Matrix, because i can't find anything wrong with it except that i didn't want the movie to end. I recommend it to all people who desperately want to witness a good teen movie.

I have a more interesting take on the movie. I was angry not at what I saw but at how the movie was put together and I was insulted by the way the director, Richard Attenborough, tried to force his message upon me.The main reason why I was not so incensed by the things that were happening in the movie is because I already knew what apartheid was and what it entailed, though I imagine this movie was meant to be informative to people who didn't. I watched this movie expecting the black African majority to be cruelly and unfairly treated by the White African minority so I was not shocked as much by what happened. The only part that stirred me up was the scene when Steve Biko was in jail. Even then I was more confused than angry because of the confusing style with which the director went from scene to scene without explanation than angry at the S. African Government. Only in retrospect was that scene emotional to me.Most of the scenes that were meant to be emotional were somewhat melodramatic with all the loud African drums and national anthems playing. When I saw bigotry by the police I was angry but I also wondered why would any intelligent person act that way or do such things.The final scene of the movie opens with the S. African national anthem playing once again and louder than ever, it's starting to get a little repetitive by this time. We see thousands of African children running out of there classrooms as if they are going to recess. But they are carrying banners and chanting and marching. It's a protest with thousand of children in and only children. They peacefully march and sing and dance reminiscent of the Martin Luther King Freedom Marches from the 60's until they are stop by a line on police officers wearing a uniform that looks strikingly like the ones the Nazi SS wore. The head officer, looking like Field Marshal Erwin Rommel, says 'this is an illegal gathering and it must be dispersed in 3 seconds' or something to that effect. He counts to three while the schoolchildren continue to sing and dance with the only confrontation being a single school kid menacingly pointing his finger at an officer. Then chief officer orders his fellow policemen to open fire.When this happened I sat back took a breath and said why are they doing this to those nice little children. What kind of person shoots dancing singing children in their backs? It then dawned on me that that was not what happened. People don't shoot kids like that just for chanting. This made me angry. I don't like being lied to about historical events. This director fabricates the truth to promote his own agenda similar to that nutcase Michael Moore and I don't like him either.What most likely happened is a large gathering of students, most likely educated college types, took place in S. Africa. The students were rightfully outraged about the policy of apartheid and they decided to cause some trouble by rioting. The police were sent and they tried to bring order but a large scale street fight took place in which many people were killed similar to Kentucky State. The movie though depicted the events like they were Tiananmen Square. The police had mo reason to fire into that crowd. That would have caused an outrage a hundred times that of Steven Biko's murder. And the protesters had every reason to cause trouble in an attempt to get publicity.I also noticed that in the background cars were overturned and buildings were burning. Did the police bullets cause that destruction? They director probably put those things in the background so that people familiar with the actual events would recognize the setting. Protests never work like that unless you have a Tiananmen Square episode. The fact that the director put such a distorted scene into the movie was insulting to my intelligence. Does he think I'm a fool who will believe anything I see?I dislike Michael Moore because he distorts the truth, attacks good people's reputation, and makes money doing it. Richard Attenborough has done the same thing with this scene, but instead of attacking individual people he has defamed all the white South Africans by making them out to be murderous, bigoted, tyrants. Apartheid was a terrible policy. It made people into second class citizens within their own land. Though I felt for the Steven Biko and all the black South Africans, my lasting memory of this movie will be of insult and anger towards the director.

I have a more interesting take on the movie. I was angry not at what I saw but at how the movie was put together and I was insulted by the way the director, Richard Attenborough, tried to force his message upon me.The main reason why I was not so incensed by the things that were happening in the movie is because I already knew what apartheid was and what it entailed, though I imagine this movie was meant to be informative to people who didn't. I watched this movie expecting the black African majority to be cruelly and unfairly treated by the White African minority so I was not shocked as much by what happened. The only part that stirred me up was the scene when Steve Biko was in jail. Even then I was more confused than angry because of the confusing style with which the director went from scene to scene without explanation than angry at the S. African Government. Only in retrospect was that scene emotional to me.Most of the scenes that were meant to be emotional were somewhat melodramatic with all the loud African drums and national anthems playing. When I saw bigotry by the police I was angry but I also wondered why would any intelligent person act that way or do such things.The final scene of the movie opens with the S. African national anthem playing once again and louder than ever, it's starting to get a little repetitive by this time. We see thousands of African children running out of there classrooms as if they are going to recess. But they are carrying banners and chanting and marching. It's a protest with thousand of children in and only children. They peacefully march and sing and dance reminiscent of the Martin Luther King Freedom Marches from the 60's until they are stop by a line on police officers wearing a uniform that looks strikingly like the ones the Nazi SS wore. The head officer, looking like Field Marshal Erwin Rommel, says 'this is an illegal gathering and it must be dispersed in 3 seconds' or something to that effect. He counts to three while the schoolchildren continue to sing and dance with the only confrontation being a single school kid menacingly pointing his finger at an officer. Then chief officer orders his fellow policemen to open fire.When this happened I sat back took a breath and said why are they doing this to those nice little children. What kind of person shoots dancing singing children in their backs? It then dawned on me that that was not what happened. People don't shoot kids like that just for chanting. This made me angry.

With incredible performances, script and the impact I felt; Enemy At The Gates sets the tone as the first great war film of the 22nd century. This film can be served as the appetizer to the main course coming out soon, Pearl Harbor.Jude Law, Joseph Feinnes, Rachel Weisz, Ed Harris and Bob Hoskins come together to re-visit the Battle of Stalingrad in 1942. The best thing about seeing each one of the actors perform was they all gave 100 percent effort to make the film as real as possible; they did an excellent job. Fiennes, Weisz and Hoskins were the icing to a cake that was delicious from the start.The highlights of Enemy At The Gates always came when Law and Harris were on screen because they played excellent psychological mind games with one another to win; furthermore, it was like watching master chess players playing for the grand prize. It was also enjoyable to see the strategies and tactics each would use to out-maneuver the other.Enemy At The Gates drew me with its many action sequences similar to those in Saving Priate Ryan. Also, the love triangle between the three main leads was interesting to watch and see how it would unfold. I felt like I was in the movie because the writer did an excellent job at making me feel exactly what they felt and experience what they were going through.There is no rule that states dialogue is needed for a successful film. While Enemy At The Gates has dialogue, the scenes that have none stand out in my mind the most because we see close-ups of both snipers and the expressions on their faces. This is incredible to me because the intensity shown on their faces speaks volumes about what the movie is really about.This is not be the best war film ever made but with two of the brightest young stars on the rise, an actress that is here to stay and a veteran that continues to turn in knock-out performances, Enemy At The Gates will be remembered for a long time.

While controversial, this movie speaks of a topic quite openly that was more or less taboo in 1999, at least to someone with a conservative background. Due to the rarity of the subject matter, this movie already peaks a certain interest in the open-minded movie-goer. The movie treats the topic of homosexuality lightly, with a comedic air. The audience can feel this aura from the overwhelming light and dancy colors that parade the screen. You will be amazed at how many everyday items can be found in bright pink and blue, from the house itself down to the last dishtowel. The background music also feels like it comes from a 50s TV sitcom, a prancy xylophone concert, which becomes irritating after playing non-stop for several minutes. All of these slight annoyances, however, really end up making you laugh at the entire situation to begin with.This movie is easy to follow, with little unaddressed, except for how Megan's parents appeared to have disowned her in two seconds when they were so open and understanding at the beginning of the movie, having watched videos about this disorder and leafed through many pamphlets from a man in a Straight is Great T-shirt. How they came to disown her so quickly was quite a mystery. It seems to be thrown out as a sudden battle Megan must fight, something to antagonize her just enough to romanticize her plight.Plot events are predictable. The girl that treats Megan with the most disdain in the beginning ends up becoming her girlfriend, a typical example of opposites attract. What is even more predictable is that any person who watches this movie knows that this True Directions boot camp is not going to do anything close to its objective except make attendees even more homosexual than they probably were in the beginning, especially Megan. The movie fluffs homosexuality to such a point that all these characters have almost no common sense or depth beyond their sexuality whatsoever. The brave, true-to-themselves bunch all run off at the end, happily ever after in a random, never-before-seen, pick-up truck that miraculously becomes decorated with hearts like a marriage getaway car. Megan's cheer at the end is cute, borderline cheesy, a must for a main character of a movie in which cheerleader appears in the title. Don't we all wish we could live in such a doll house world?Men who are looking for lesbian action in this movie will be disappointed. Overall, this movie serves its purpose to make light of a matter and make people laugh all at once. Being that it was funny and an interesting topic, versus having a plot line that began to melt into a growing puddle as the movie progressed, with shallow characters swimming about, I'd say this film deserves a 4\/10.

Back to the Future is a classic for those who were teenagers (and the not so young ones of that time) when it was first released. Emmet Brown is arguably one of the most remarkable mad scientists ever created (by the way, mad scientists are another main topic in Sci-Fi) and I never tire of watching its re-runs over and over again, anytime.Well, perhaps it's just me, being not an important scientist but a picky moviegoer. I hope this works as a recognition of MY own. Back to the Future will keep rocking yet far beyond the few years to come.

They virtually never work, and this is just about the worst ever. It's extremely rare and I don't know if it was ever even released in the UK. I know it never got as far as Scotland, for which we can thank Hadrian's Wall. The truth is, the Romans didn't build it, we did to keep films this bad out!This was obviously a pet project for Bob Hoskins who produced it, but you'd not know it to look at him. He's terrible in the lead. No character, no soul, nothing. Well, he is funny a couple of times, eating his dinner with his hat on or his death scene, but I don't think it was intentional. But compared to the rest of the cast, Eddie Izzard hopeless as the Russian ambassador, Jim Broadbent doing his Only Fools and Horses bit as Inspector Heat, Chris Bale's baleful idiot brother, he almost looks good. But then with the lead going to Patricia Arquette, who wouldn't? She's been worse, but that still doesn't make her any good in this. Her Winnie Verloc is pitiful in all the wrong ways. Why do they hire her? The only consolations are the scenes with Gerard Depardieu and Robin Williams in the restaurant. They work and sum up some of the spirit of the novel even though the two are pretty dire in their scenes in the rest of the film. The adaptation is faithful but dead. It tells the story but not the characters or the themes and the direction by scripter Christopher Hampton isn't very good either. Honestly, even if you like Conrad you couldn't care less about this one. It slipped into the TV schedules late night last week without any warning, and with a film this bad that's probably just to hide ITV's embarrassment at showing it. Badly disappointing and then some.

Ladd conveys Shane's mixed feelings and internal struggle in a quiet but very effective fashion, and he also makes the character fit in perfectly with the story and the other characters.  The rest of the cast is quite good as well, but it is Ladd's performance and the character of Shane that raise it above being just a good story, and that make the viewer feel part of it.The story is an interesting combination of several familiar themes, with the battle-weary gunslinger getting caught up in the struggle between homesteaders and ranchers, each of whom have their own internal issues.  Shane is both an observer and a participant, providing an interesting point of reference.  The young boy Joey who idolizes Shane complements Shane's own perspective, and the boy's rather exaggerated responses to events also complement Shane's\/Ladd's understated reactions.The story moves at a good pace and builds up tension nicely, with the cast getting good mileage even out of the simpler characters.
