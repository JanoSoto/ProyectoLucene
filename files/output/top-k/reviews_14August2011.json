[{"date":"14 August 2011","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Living on a dying Space Coast, this movie is a reminder about the motivation to go into space. The desire to explore. The story is about 17 year old Homer Hickam living in a coal mining town that's going through many crises's, including deaths, strikes, and ultimately shutting down. But Homer, the one kid who used to be the laughing stock redeems himself by bringing a dying town together on one dream, to go into outer space. Sadly I wish it could be the same for the Space Coast. I wish this movie could bring back the inspiration to these people here. But this movie is at my #1 spot. I don't care how epic Transformers Dark of the Moon was, or how awesome Armageddon was, October Sky, the movie that's not epic, the movie, that is my all time favorite. It's theme's, it's lesson exceeds all things EPIC and creates another level of EPIC it's self. Even though there isn't meteors or robots or explosions. I highly recommend this movie to anyone of all ages.
