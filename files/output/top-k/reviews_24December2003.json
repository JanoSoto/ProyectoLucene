[{"date":"24 December 2003","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  Edtv is a great movie that proves that life on the cameras can be very annoying after a long period of time. Ed is a normal guy who thinks that fame could prove to his advantage when slowly and surely, he realizes that fame has bad after effects after the family and the loved ones are bothered by cameras in the face as well. Jenna Elfman, who played the hippie wife in dharma and greg, didnt really fit in the movie in my opinion. perhaps another leading lady, like renee zilweger or leelee sobelki would have done a better performance.  this movie is on sometimes on tbs, and they usually do several repeats over and over again, so if you have the opportunity to watch cable, then watch edtv.
