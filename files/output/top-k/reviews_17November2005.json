When Laney (Rachael Leigh Cook) got her makeover, I thought she looked good, especially in the clothing she wore after that point in the movie. It would have been nice if she had kept her really long hair, though. As for Taylor (Jodi Lyn O'Keefe), I thought she was an absolute b****! This was because of her attitude and the way she treated Laney. When she poured beer on Laney's dress at one point in the film, I wanted to grab Taylor and slap her on the side of her face. There was only one scene that grossed me out, and that was the pubic hair pizza scene. Oh, that was really gross! I mean, who would want to eat pizza with someone else's pubic hair on it?
