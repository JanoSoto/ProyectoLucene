Feelings will be hurt, eyes will bulge, emotions will fly, and my useful comment rating will plummet...This movie was as good as the second, which was better than the original.There, I said it!But its true. The murders have moved to Hollywood as the movie Stab 3 begins filming. However, the actors of the movie soon start to be killed off, and the murders become the real movie. Sidney has gone into hiding this time, and is not in much of the movie. But Dewey, Gale, and a group of actors are targets for this new string of killings. We have many new interesting kills in this movie, as well as a great storyline. The story here takes after events which occurred before the first Scream.There's also a lot of great lines that they characters spew at each other. I recommend this to fans of Scream and Scream 2, 8\/10.
