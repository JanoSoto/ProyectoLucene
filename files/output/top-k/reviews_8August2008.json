I liked this one more than Ratatouille and probably as much as The Incredibles. It has a story based on the friendship and that story is pretty known, this time the background is great so that basic story works in a perfect way. Everything happens in 1957 and as you know everything turns around that Iron Giant (voice of Vin Diesel). The human protagonist is a kid, Hogarth Hughes (voice of Eli Marienthal), who is influenced by science fiction movies and comic book stories -and MAD magazine- and who is going to have the first real contact with the Iron Giant, when he was already the theme in the conversations of the people in the town. The mother of Hogarth (voice of Jennifer Aniston) is use to hear him talking about those stories so when he talks about an Iron Giant she is not very surprised. It is a story of friendship first so the robot is practically a little kid, a really unique one, since he is learning everything, showing enthusiasm on that but of course you can't just make your friend a giant robot who needs metal as food and thinks that he just can remove a train track any time he is hungry (look at the character who was on that train, he looks a little similar to Marty Scorsese!). That's a truly big problem and of course Hogarth will have some problems if his mom or any other person meet his new friend but of course he will find some good people that will understand the robot, of course once they are calm after the obvious shock for meeting the Iron Giant. Actually he will only meet one person and his name is Dean (voice of Harry Connick, Jr.) and he is a really cool character, the opposite of Kent Mansley (voice of Christopher McDonald) who is the classic investigator of a mysterious and ridiculous case that first is making fun of it but once he is affected in a direct way the robot will be no more a joke and it will be a true objective as a product of the paranoia. At this point the Iron Giant turns to be a King Kong and since I haven't meet a person who feels good by watching the end of Kong here nobody will be with the army and here our Giant turns to be a real amazing robot that by then has already the S on his chest - A really great character that delivers even really hilarious moments.The voices are simply good. Is easy to recognize the voice of Jennifer Aniston here but is not the voice of Vin Diesel. For me is still strange to see him in the cast. I really dislike his performances. Anyway, the animation is really terrific and in the end this is a magnificent picture with great and very likable characters. I promise you that your family will love it and with its story it won't be a surprise if your girlfriend cries near the end, believe me. In short, The Iron Giant is one of the best films of 1999.PS reading some comments for this film I found specially one that gained my attention. On that comment one of the things against this film is that it is anti-gun, anti-hunting, etc. In my opinion you don't need s*** like guns. I loved this film!!!!!!

It seems like a forgotten artifact, abandoned like King Solomon's mines, discovered only by only those who maintain some fundamental interest; what you find is going to depend on how open you keep your mind. Rest assured, those of you who would rather ignore it aren't going to be missing a diamond, but I'd say an arrowhead isn't out of the question.I'll dispense with the metaphors Congo is not a bad film. I watched it many times in my youth and just watched it again yesterday, and the biggest complaint I have is that the original song 'Sounds Of Africa' is awful. I won't summarize the plot or analyze the film in explicit detail, but I will say that it is briskly paced, sharply written, and features solid characterizations, or as solid as they can be in an adventure epic. As an example, Tim Curry has been dismissed too often as the comic relief when he is actually central to the plot and turns in a deliciously dense performance, above and beyond the limitations of his character. Considering the slightly campy tone, the special effects are well above what anyone could expect. Just don't come prepared to judge them based on modern standards or Jurassic Park. Personally, I find physical effects more endearing than CGI anyway.As many reviewers have said, it's a film of a bygone era, a lost world story treated as an adventure epic. Clearly it's not Indiana Jones and the tone tends to waver a bit, but it's never boring, and if it had been adapted from the book directly, it would have been. I can't imagine someone watching the airplane SAM scene without being excited by the action, or watching the group's border crossing struggles without at least sporting a grin.So, check your ego and check your critical faculties; this is no Citizen Kane and it doesn't pretend to be. Those that harshly criticize it, by my estimation, have a lot to learn about having a good time at the movies.

Apparently, he has angered an Italian boss, Johnny Caspar (Jon Polito), a volatile fella who wants him dead, plain and simple. However, Irish leader Leo O' Bannion (Albert Finney) disagrees, mainly because Bernie's sister Verna (Marcia Gay Harden) is his mistress. And in between these two stands Tom Reagan (Gabriel Byrne), a taciturn, calculating hit-man who has an agenda of his own, derived from a bizarre moral code and a tendency to favor rationality over violence. The full extent of his involvement is too complicated to explain - the fact that he's sleeping with Verna and has huge gambling debts is just the tip of the iceberg.The Coens' detractors often accuse them of creating beautifully framed yet hollow pictures, their characters being ice-cold constructions instead of human beings. Miller's Crossing proves, perhaps better than any other film, that statement's lack of veracity it's the characters and their interactions that carry the narrative. In fact, more often than not they're what keeps the viewer alert in spite of the labyrinthine plot. Exactly who is double-crossing who and why might not seem clear at first, but seeing those people talk and act in a universe that gets more violent by the minute gives the film that special something that separates it from lesser crime movies.Byrne, being the one who has to guide us through the entire feature, is cold and seemingly merciless, but beneath the icy facade lies a warmth that makes his performance all the more effective.

Apparently, he has angered an Italian boss, Johnny Caspar (Jon Polito), a volatile fella who wants him dead, plain and simple. However, Irish leader Leo O' Bannion (Albert Finney) disagrees, mainly because Bernie's sister Verna (Marcia Gay Harden) is his mistress. And in between these two stands Tom Reagan (Gabriel Byrne), a taciturn, calculating hit-man who has an agenda of his own, derived from a bizarre moral code and a tendency to favor rationality over violence. The full extent of his involvement is too complicated to explain - the fact that he's sleeping with Verna and has huge gambling debts is just the tip of the iceberg.The Coens' detractors often accuse them of creating beautifully framed yet hollow pictures, their characters being ice-cold constructions instead of human beings.

I don't mind shock value as long as it's relevant to the story but what was the need to show a penis or sexual intercourse (where you can actually see penetration)?
