[{"date":"26 December 2013","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" When people go to the movies, they go with a lot of emotion build up inside of them. Those emotions can be happy, sad, angry or even excitement. Steven Spielberg is particularly one of the best movie director out there in Hollywood today. He can make movies the way movies were meant to be made. He makes movies that are filled with wonder, magic, and even thrills. But, in this science-fiction thriller made by Spielberg, those emotions are obvious to the audience. In Minority Report, Tom Cruise plays John Anderton, the chief of Washington D.C. PreCrime police force. As the movie opens, Anderton and his fellow colleagues witness an upcoming murder from a future killer, who's planning to commit a future crime. The way it works is that in 2054 A.D., PreCrime can stop a future criminal from having to commit a future crime. In other words, catch the criminal before he or she commits the crime. For the last six years, Washington D.C. has been murder-free because of PreCrime. Furthermore, the PreCogs that are used in this police unit can see visions of the future. There are three of them, each of which are stationed inside a pool of milk. These PreCogs have precognitive abilities to see their future murders. Everything seems to be okay for Anderton until one day he witnesses himself committing a future crime. Now, how did that happen? Anderton quickly tries to hide the footage and is forced to run from the law as he tries to dodge the police every which way he can. Colin Farrell plays Danny Witwer, an very risky Department of Justice agent in the PreCrime unit. Witwer and Anderton inexplicably creates a tension between themselves even at the beginning of Anderton's run from the law. Max Von Sydow plays the official of the PreCrime unit and is also Anderton's superior. He is also drawn into the investigation. Meanwhile, Witwer tries to replace Anderton's position by placing himself as the chief of the PreCrime police force. Most of the movie consists of Anderton trying to outrun the law by avoiding them at any costs. Some of the action sequences in Minority Report are very well-directed by Spielberg. One of my favorite out of all of them is when Anderton gets into a fight with Witwer inside a car factory. The storyline of Minority Report gets complicated, I think, because the movie wants us to solve this entire mystery behind all of the technology that this world has in store. But, there's more to that. The movie also deals with specific themes of mistaken identity and family relationships. We even see how Anderton deal with the pain and suffering throughout the movie with him feeding himself pills and medication. Even more specifically, we see a distinctive relationship between him and his son, who drowned in a swimming pool. The story of Minority Report was based off a short story by cult science-fiction author Phillip K. Dick. To me, Dick's other movie adaptations including Blade Runner and Total Recall were also very successful critically, but also holds a deeper meaning to the hardware. In both movies, you can see the everyday man being forced into a situation where technology affects their surroundings and themselves. The cinematography is absolutely well photographed with a bleached-colored tint. The look of the movie is fascinating to see and eye-popping to look at. Spielberg's vision of the future has never been more better than before. This is the second Steven Spielberg's movie to be set in the future during the early 2000's. His other sci-fi film, A.I. Artificial Intelligence, was also a very good looking movie. Minority Report is certainly one of the best movies of 2002. The feel and look of the movie makes it seems that Spielberg was actually making a tech-noir film, which he did. The one other criticism that I have about Minority Report is that this movie focuses more on everyday themes that affect our society. That is significant to other science-fiction movies as well. But, the way Minority Report portrays those themes makes us wonder about the world we live in. This movie did come out in the early 2000's and according to my critical praise of this movie, I can only say this world is probably moving a lot more faster, even though technology is making several advantages and advances in our everyday lives. You can love it or you hate it, but you can't underestimate technology in the 21st century. The world is changing and we are too. ★★★★ 4 stars.

Something about people breaking out and singing out of no where just seems to bug me and also the song after song happening just&#x85; I just don't normally care for that stuff. Now after saying this, you would think that I wouldn't like this movie, right? Actually I fell in love with it. The music and characters personalities actually work really well together, making the show just lovable. Through all the small flaws that it had (some of which are understandable as how old the show is) the story pops out the most.I really love the characters. Each one has a memorable personality that defines there character and they don't really break that stereotype except for what they lone to do weather its dancing, singing, acting out, or creating music. When you see them outside of doing what they love, you see broken people who have had their dreams smashed before their eyes. They do all they can to protect themselves from being rather gitty and feely to being grumps and adding rather sarcastic remarks. Each one feels like they have been made for the different forms of depression and loss. I know I'm going into psychological ideas for the show but this is really why I love this show. We have Danny who has his hopes and dreams shattered right out of the gate but in his mind, he believes that it is only a set back to his plans on being a star. He is what I would call the first stage of loss called Denial. He just can't believe that the world is as bad as people are making it out to be. Then we have the anger stage and I feel the character that says this most is Cranston Goat and partly in his dancing partner, Frances Albacore. They are always being sarcastic and rude to the others. The only stage that does not seem to be shown is the third with Bargaining. No one seems to do that type of stuff although we have a very over optimistic hippo that is being nice to everyone, always trying to help them out. Forth stage of Depression is depression itself, shown very well in T.W. who is always saying negative things based on his fortune cookies. The last one I believe would be for Sawyer, Acceptance. She accepts that she will never make it to the top, she will always be the secretary, never the Diva, and even forgets her dreams. She doesn't even do it for fun and thinks it's just a waist of time.We have a story that pretty much has a storybook tale of a guy looking to make it big in the movies doing what he truly loves to do, to dance and sing. As he gets to Hollywood though, not everything is as glamorous as it was made out to be and part of that is something that I believe not many picked out on when the show was first shown. The storyline has a very strong feeling to racism that is surprising for a show made for younger children and it's what I believe makes the show speak to the older crowd. If you substitute the word 'Animal' with the word 'Black' or 'Latino' or even 'Asian' you can kind of see where I'm going with it. The idea that these animals are not treated with the same idea as humans. They don't get a chance to be a star, only background characters who are pretty much stereotyped by the type of creature they are. For example, the Noah Ark show they start taping makes them have only one line and its based on the sound there animal makes. The dog says woof, the cow says moo, and the cat says meow. They aren't given a chance to show they can do anything else because they weren't even cast because of their talent.The artwork is really catered to the year it came out but it actually doesn't feel all that old. The art style was created with very outrageous and exaggerated features like rather skinny waists that make them look like they would brake apart at any moment. We have cartoon-ish faces and at times they end up squashing and stretching as they move in order to show a rather extensive movement. It's hard to really explain it but its pretty amazing that the humans are drawn almost as though they are animals themselves or don't seem 'human'. The animals seem so much more human then the humans themselves though it's hard to actually explain. The only one that seems any close to human is the little Darla Dimple character who is the main villain of the show.The music is actually really nice and catchy, making you just want to dance at some times which works with the whole concept of the story. If you want to have a story about people trying to become a star, you need some pretty high class music to make it. I found myself singing along with some of the songs including the opening song 'I'm on my Way' which seemed to tell the storyline rather well. The voice acting is really good with big name people like Don Knotts playing the rather nervous turtle, T.W., to Betty Lou Gerson who had done the voice of Cruella De Vil in the 1961 version of 101 Dalmations. We even have Dee Bradley Baker who did the voice of Daffy Duck in Space Jam and did voices in many old TV shows like 'Hey Arnold!', 'Rugrats', and 'Johnny Bravo'. When you put all these voices together, it makes for a really interesting sounding movie.

","genre":"Animation, Comedy, Family"},{"date":"26 December 2013","score":"","review":" John Kruger (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is a US Marshal who specialises in Witness Protection. Lee Cullen (Vanessa Williams) is an employee of CYREZ who, with the assistance of the FBI attempts to infiltrate her own organisation as it is believed that her boss William Donohue (James Cromwell) is selling weapons illegally on the black market. Cullen manages to acquire a disk which contains vital evidence regarding the illicit deal, but when those that Donohue are working for find out that Cullen has this piece of evidence, they set about doing everything they can to silence her and it's down to John Kruger to do his best to protect her; As action thrillers go this is fairly generic with very little in the way of surprises. However, the story is constantly engaging and the action never really lets up throughout the 115 minute running time. Caan was solid as always and I also felt that Vanessa Williams was also fairly convincing in her respective role. The film also has quite a lot of 'tongue in cheek' humour running through it such as when Kruger parachutes out of a plane and lands in a car compound and asks a couple of kids where he is and they just reply 'Earth'. Another funny moment is when Kruger catches up with Cullen and she says 'You're late' and Kruger replies 'Traffic'. It just showed that the film maker's managed to make a serious film, but not one that took itself too seriously. Michael Bay does this a lot (I know that he has a lot of haters, but I meant this as a compliment).Whilst I'm all for fun and things not always being taken seriously in actions films, I do get bothered when filmmaker's create set pieces that defy the law of physics in order to make things more exciting; there is a scene on the aircraft where Arnie opens the door at a relatively high altitude. However, for some reason he isn't sucked out of the door even when he's sat next to it and seemingly doesn't have to hold onto anything to stay in the aircraft. Then a short while later, he finds himself clinging onto the edge of the door on the outside of the plane (Laws of Physics have now been remembered) and then he lets go and manages to avoid being sucked into one of the engines which is directly behind him (admittedly it was on fire, but surely it still would have had enough force to suck him into the engine rather than under it). Exciting? Yes, Plausible? Hell no!!!!!Then the following scene shows him chasing a parachute through the sky (which has clearly been ripped off from the start of Moonraker)Then we come to Arnie himself, whilst there's no denying that he's not the best of actors, I personally feel that he is one of the best when it comes to delivering the 'One Liners' - he seems to do it in a dry sort of way which just almost seems effortless. Of course, he's also such a big screen presence that he doesn't always need much dialogue to be awesome (think about the first Terminator film - how many lines did he actually have in that film and he was still brilliant and so was that film).In summary, this is a fairly generic film which we have seen several times before with very few surprises. However, it's serviceable because the story is good, the performances from the main cast are good and the film never lags or loses momentum for one minute. Whilst, it's far from being Arnie's best (admittedly the bar has been set high with films like T2, T1, Predator etc) this is still a very good film which seems to have been overlooked by a lot of people. Definitely worth watching! ","genre":null},{"date":"26 December 2013","score":"","review":" John Kruger (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is a US Marshal who specialises in Witness Protection.

Hell no!!!!!Then the following scene shows him chasing a parachute through the sky (which has clearly been ripped off from the start of Moonraker)Then we come to Arnie himself, whilst there's no denying that he's not the best of actors, I personally feel that he is one of the best when it comes to delivering the 'One Liners' - he seems to do it in a dry sort of way which just almost seems effortless. Of course, he's also such a big screen presence that he doesn't always need much dialogue to be awesome (think about the first Terminator film - how many lines did he actually have in that film and he was still brilliant and so was that film).In summary, this is a fairly generic film which we have seen several times before with very few surprises. However, it's serviceable because the story is good, the performances from the main cast are good and the film never lags or loses momentum for one minute. Whilst, it's far from being Arnie's best (admittedly the bar has been set high with films like T2, T1, Predator etc) this is still a very good film which seems to have been overlooked by a lot of people.

","genre":"Action, Drama, Mystery"},{"date":"26 December 2013","score":"","review":" John Kruger (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is a US Marshal who specialises in Witness Protection. Lee Cullen (Vanessa Williams) is an employee of CYREZ who, with the assistance of the FBI attempts to infiltrate her own organisation as it is believed that her boss William Donohue (James Cromwell) is selling weapons illegally on the black market. Cullen manages to acquire a disk which contains vital evidence regarding the illicit deal, but when those that Donohue are working for find out that Cullen has this piece of evidence, they set about doing everything they can to silence her and it's down to John Kruger to do his best to protect her; As action thrillers go this is fairly generic with very little in the way of surprises. However, the story is constantly engaging and the action never really lets up throughout the 115 minute running time. Caan was solid as always and I also felt that Vanessa Williams was also fairly convincing in her respective role. The film also has quite a lot of 'tongue in cheek' humour running through it such as when Kruger parachutes out of a plane and lands in a car compound and asks a couple of kids where he is and they just reply 'Earth'. Another funny moment is when Kruger catches up with Cullen and she says 'You're late' and Kruger replies 'Traffic'. It just showed that the film maker's managed to make a serious film, but not one that took itself too seriously. Michael Bay does this a lot (I know that he has a lot of haters, but I meant this as a compliment).Whilst I'm all for fun and things not always being taken seriously in actions films, I do get bothered when filmmaker's create set pieces that defy the law of physics in order to make things more exciting; there is a scene on the aircraft where Arnie opens the door at a relatively high altitude. However, for some reason he isn't sucked out of the door even when he's sat next to it and seemingly doesn't have to hold onto anything to stay in the aircraft.

There is a little bit of nostalgia about this show and the comedic way they play some of the characters. Seriously, how they make some of them feels a lot like a joke on society. A war starting just because of a song that would be played at a lovely little wedding. It seems similar to why friends may bicker about little things and then not talk to each other for a rather long time. Anyway, back to the review. The comedy is really slap stick with characters getting hurt or having exaggerated expressions as their main gimmick. In other parts of the show, they tug at your heart and in some cases, we even see what is going through Gulliver's mind and his homesickness.The artwork is rather pretty (Comparing it to other shows around this time) and each character moves smoothly and consistently. It's interesting how much detail they placed on Gulliver and how really simple the little people are. Most little people look rather fat and\/or out of proportion except for the princess and prince. Well, them and Gulliver. Colors are rather saturated and yet you can see pretty much everything. I say it's close to the old version of Disney's movies. Now Gulliver seems like a really cheerful man and is always smiling or having an over exaggerated movement to show his pleasure or feelings. It feels odd but I believe that is what they were actually going for.The voices are classic fun with Pinto Colvig (Who was the voice of the original Goofy and Grumpy from 'Disney's Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs') playing Gabby, Jessica Dragonette (famous singer) playing Princess Glory, and Sam Parker as Gulliver. I'm not really sure about Sam Parker's play on Gulliver thought because he seems to be rather bland of a character. Nothing seems to startle him as he wakes up to find tiny men all around him and a war starting up. When someone or something surprises him, all he really says is 'My My&#x85;' and leaves it at that.So what do I like about this show? Well, it's not as stupid as many of the new stuff and is rather nostalgic for me even with its faults. Even if you don't really like animated shows, you should really take a look at this one. If you do like animated shows, its something I consider part of history.

First of all, the movie needed more bits of dark and hilarious dialogs like that one, not only it is hilarious but it subtly sets the eternal gap between the off-the-wall Addams Family and the common people, no matter how eager they are to discover their 'traditions'. That moment echoes another scene where Wednesday (Cristina Ricci) asked a Scout girl if the biscuits were made of real children that kind of humor was severely lacking in The Addams Family and the more I think about it, the more I realize it was the only one the film could provide besides the obligatory children-oriented slapstick.The second problem is that they still felt the need to ruin to that shovel quote by actually showing them 'waking up the dead' and that kind of on-the-nose humor is a blatant example of the way they ruined the very effect the film could have as a comedy. I really didn't need to see what the game consisted on, I needed to laugh and the did you bring the shovel was enough a punch-line. So why did they had to show everyone having fun in the cemetery since it is the audience that is supposed to have fun? Barry Sonnenfeld's adaptation of the iconic cartoon made me realize one thing he certainly understood the Addams Family and whatever they 'stood for(', but he did not understand the audience.But let's give Sonnenfeld the credit he deserves, his film is marvelously looking, it carries that scary Gothic look where I suspect many trainees made their bones before working later on the Harry Potter' franchise. The photography, the costume design and naturally, the casting contribute to set the basis of a great cartoon adaptation. Raul Julia makes a perfectly suave and seductive Gomez Adams, and Anjelica Huston has never been so frighteningly sensual, and more than that, both had that unique chemistry going, if I ever think of a dad and mom who love each other to death, well, I guess Gomez and Morticia come to my mind first.Cristina Ricci is more than convincing as Wednesday, whose main occupation consists on tormenting her cooperative brother Pugsley (Jimmy Workman) with many instruments, from a knife to an electric chair. And when she passes by Morticia, carrying a big knife for her brother, Morticia takes it from her, to give her a larger one, how motherly of her! The moment is funny but not as the biscuits and shovel quotes, for the simple reason that they occur within the family, it is supposed to be normal, and as soon as we get used the family's weirdness, we stop looking at their eccentricity with surprised eyes. There has to be an outsider.The outsider issue could have served the plot, either someone normal goes to the Addams Family, or the Addams Family goes to the normal world. The first idea is abandoned when the intruder is a man who bears a striking resemblance with lost uncle Fester (remarkably played by Christopher Lloyd) and is used by his tyrannical mother (Elizabeth Wilson) as a decoy in order to throw the family away with the help of a corrupted lawyer (Dan Hedaya). The first acts celebrates the reunion between Fester and his brother but it is victim of the same problem, it spends so much time in that inner circle we stop looking at it as weird.The consequence is that the moments supposed to provide the biggest laughs don't work well, nothing comes much from the Addams party except for Cousin It's scene-stealing appearance and a fantastic 'Mamuchka' knife-dance. What lacks again is the presence of a straight person to convey the reaction of the normal word, it works for all comedies, the effectiveness of gags relies on their impact on a character who'd hate what happens to him. When Wednesday tortures her brother, it's not funny anymore because he enjoys it, how about she plays hide-and-seek with a 'normal' boy and we'll see what the outcome will be.The Addams Family isn't totally unfunny, the film makes you smile and is visually entertaining but there were so much room for great laughs, it's a pity the film didn't exploit these eccentricities. The third act where the family 'discovered' the real world could have originated so many great gags, starting with good old Thing working in Fedex express. That's the stuff we expect, not a long and continuous exposition leading to a superficial conflict, the only 'conflict' possible is between the 'Addams' and normality, as during a funny school play sequence with an unexpected outburst of blood splattering the audience.The film should have been like its last five minutes, from the way they get rid of the two villains by pushing them in a coffin, are they dead? asks Pugsley does it matter? replies Wednesday. There is also good old Lurch (Carel Struycken) welcoming kids playing 'tricks or treats' with a tender smile, their reaction, no matter how predictable is, would make anyone laugh. And again, have you noticed, it featured 'normal' people.

The moment is funny but not as the biscuits and shovel quotes, for the simple reason that they occur within the family, it is supposed to be normal, and as soon as we get used the family's weirdness, we stop looking at their eccentricity with surprised eyes. There has to be an outsider.The outsider issue could have served the plot, either someone normal goes to the Addams Family, or the Addams Family goes to the normal world. The first idea is abandoned when the intruder is a man who bears a striking resemblance with lost uncle Fester (remarkably played by Christopher Lloyd) and is used by his tyrannical mother (Elizabeth Wilson) as a decoy in order to throw the family away with the help of a corrupted lawyer (Dan Hedaya). The first acts celebrates the reunion between Fester and his brother but it is victim of the same problem, it spends so much time in that inner circle we stop looking at it as weird.The consequence is that the moments supposed to provide the biggest laughs don't work well, nothing comes much from the Addams party except for Cousin It's scene-stealing appearance and a fantastic 'Mamuchka' knife-dance. What lacks again is the presence of a straight person to convey the reaction of the normal word, it works for all comedies, the effectiveness of gags relies on their impact on a character who'd hate what happens to him. When Wednesday tortures her brother, it's not funny anymore because he enjoys it, how about she plays hide-and-seek with a 'normal' boy and we'll see what the outcome will be.The Addams Family isn't totally unfunny, the film makes you smile and is visually entertaining but there were so much room for great laughs, it's a pity the film didn't exploit these eccentricities. The third act where the family 'discovered' the real world could have originated so many great gags, starting with good old Thing working in Fedex express. That's the stuff we expect, not a long and continuous exposition leading to a superficial conflict, the only 'conflict' possible is between the 'Addams' and normality, as during a funny school play sequence with an unexpected outburst of blood splattering the audience.The film should have been like its last five minutes, from the way they get rid of the two villains by pushing them in a coffin, are they dead? asks Pugsley does it matter? replies Wednesday. There is also good old Lurch (Carel Struycken) welcoming kids playing 'tricks or treats' with a tender smile, their reaction, no matter how predictable is, would make anyone laugh. And again, have you noticed, it featured 'normal' people. As I said, either the normal world comes to Addams, or they come to it, the first comes too rarely, the second too late.The film is still a good Family comedy with cute one-liners, but it really could've been a laugh-riot. And they still had to ruin the ending by preventing us from the famous Addams score at the end, what were they thinking with that dreadfully-90's Addams groove thing?!

The similarities between the two movies were blatant, and I couldn't believe that Tim Burton didn't intend to make a parody of Roland Emmerich' blockbuster. Two films featuring Aliens' invasions, Earth destructions prevented in-extremis thanks to a cleverly hidden McGuffin, with an all-star cast and heart-pounding sequences of buildings exploding and crowds panicking, there was no way that Tim Burton didn't take his inspiration from the first film which I enjoyed so much I enjoyed the second even more.It's only later that I learned that the films were actually released on the same year, that Tim Burton had no idea of the other project and simply made his tribute to the good old Sci-fi B-movies that nourished his childhood and inspired his masterpiece Ed Wood. You know, these movies with fake-looking flying saucers and weird-looking green creatures supposedly coming from the Red Planet. I guess Independence Day looked the same because of a similar inspiration. The difference is that Independence Day takes its stuff seriously but the viewers didn't need to and enjoyed the film for what it was, an action-packed adrenalin-inducing spectacle and Mars Attacks! take for granted our detachment and make fun of it, with us.The result is a hit-and-miss for each movie, while Independence Day was a ground-breaking movie on the field of special effects, through notably the unforgettable destruction of the White House, the Empire State Building and many other cultural landmarks, the film suffered from its own heavily patriotic undertones, reaching the peak of ridiculousness with President Bill Pullman's inspirational speech about the independence of the world coinciding with the National Day, as to suggest that USA works like the world in microcosm, not the likeliest attitude to appeal to international crowds. However, we would accept it since only Hollywood can make such films, they deserve to make their country the real star.The second criticism was the portrayal of the Aliens who looked like some mixes of the Aliens, the Gremlins and giant octopuses, making impossible to believe that these animalistic creatures would be capable of building these sky&#x96;covering giant saucers, especially since they were supposed to work like 'computers'. One quick glimpse on Tim Burton's poster proves that his Martians, no matter how cartoonish they look, make more 'believable' invaders. They look like human skulls with giant heads (more room for the brains I guess) they're ugly, even scary, but you can take them as 'people' from other planet, and if they talk the talk (a successions of 'dak dak' translatable to English), they also walk the walk.But that's a superficial judgment, on the content, Tim Burton, with his predilection for Black Humor mocks all the archetypes of the genre, starting with the so-called superiority of humans in general and Americans in particular. The White House is destroyed; the President is totally defenseless despite his General's coercions to launch a nuclear missile on them. And nothing seems able to destroy their Martians; a flag-brandishing soldier gets immediately laser-ed and turns into a skeleton. That's the kind of stuff you'd never see in Independence Day, the fact is that there is no lovable, no charismatic, no hero in Mars Attacks, not in cinematic standards anyway.What we have instead is a great all-star cast taking each role with fun and innocence. Pierce Brosnan is a charming and distinguished engineer who seems both fascinated and pleased by the new arrival, Annette Bening is a peace-loving dim-witted woman who believes the Martians will bring peace; Michael J. Fox and Sarah Jessica Parker (in love with Brosnan's character) are the obligatory scoop-driven journalists. Martin Short is the constantly excited White House Public Agents and Jack Nicholson plays a dual role as a Las Vegas crook and the American president, curious to meet these creatures while the disgusted First Lady (Glenn Close) would refuse to serve eat off the Van Buren china. They have (naturally) a daughter, played by a teenager Natalie Portman, who wouldn't care less if Michael Jackson was coming.All these people, and many more, from the underground side, Joe Don Baker as the redneck father of the ill-fated soldier (Jack Black) and a donut shop working boy (Lukas Haas) he treats like a bum (who'd inevitably turns out as a hero) thanks to the help of his grandmother (Sylvia Sidney) whose main leisure consists on listening to Hank Williams' songs. This colorful gallery provides many different reactions toward the Martians' coming until the Leader destroys a beautiful dove, suggesting that the Aliens hate birds. He also kills General Casey (Paul Winfield) in one of these scenes that would make any viewer cheer, as the way Rod Steiger, the most hawkish of all, gets shortened and stamped on like a miserable bug, some bits of humor that would have probably been regarded as unpatriotic during the Bush years.Tim Burton certainly had fun making this film and so did the actors, so I don't see how anyone can't enjoy it. I was surprised to learn that the film didn't meet with positive reactions. I didn't believe it wasn't nominated for Best Visual Effects, or maybe it had the misfortune to be released right after Independence Day. I suspect the release of Men In Black hurt the film more since the film had a sharper humor and set higher standards in terms of special effects. Still, Mars Attacks! is great entertainment with an interesting ending, and a bad-ass duo featuring Jim Brown and Tom Jones.And whoever played that female Alien was so damn stunning!

A chubby twelve year old girl, who finds herself constantly browbeaten by her fifteen year old sister, Elena (Roxane Mesquida) while they are vacationing with their parents off the coast of France. Elena, unlike her sister, is thin, incredibly gorgeous, and possesses a beautiful body. A topic of discussion between the two young girls as they listlessly walk around the resort is their virginity and their relationships. Elena, while sexually promiscuous, holds the belief that your virginity should be taken by someone you love. Her younger sister, however, believes that you should your first time should happen just to happen and you should just get it over with.While walking, they meet a law student named Fernando (Libero De Rienzo), who immediately finds himself attracted to Elena. Not long after meeting him does Elena invite Fernando up to her room to talk. Fernando believes like Elena does - that sex should be something sacred and special - but he winds up convincing her to partake in anal sex instead, as vaginal sex is something that judges whether or not you still have your virginity.While it is questionable that Fernando actually believes what he is saying, we can see Elena's hesitation during the foreplay and the sex. We are well aware of her beliefs at this point in time, however, we can see that she has a common curiosity about sex so much so that she simply wants to see just how the act is performed and executed.This scene is one lengthy, naturalistic shot Breillat conducts in the room shared by Elena and Anaïs, boldly establishing real-time, mood, and discomfort just by the way the shot is framed, how long it lasts, and how the characters are placed inside the shot. Fernando and Elena are spooning, with Elena's nightgown on and her vagina and pubic hair clearly visible to the audience. Fernando continues to rub her stomach in a way that doesn't change Elena's blank, frustrated, and confused expression. She knows what she's doing is wrong but is overcome by understandable adolescent curiosity. Anaïs is laying in bed several feet away, closing her eyes and pretending her sister's innocence isn't being taken away in front of her.Fat Girl works well because it illustrates the sexual tendencies of the female and a believable sibling rivalry that is captured with surprising purity and tenderness. When Anaïs and Elena fight, it's nothing but believable. When the two talk quietly in bed it is also believable, almost as if they are real-life sisters. This is because Reboux and Mesquida are not only great screen presences but evoke relatable chemistry as young girls. This chemistry is what the entire film rests on, due to the fact that parents' roles are predicated off of disinterest and ignorance, leaving the girls to utilize each other for companionship and advice.It's a tough subject and Breillat doesn't sugarcoat it. Either she lived a grim reality similar to her characters or she has seen friends go through circumstances akin to Anaïs's and Elena's. Or perhaps she has her head inside a teenage girls' head. Perhaps she just has a deep resonance and an awareness to the sexual maturity of adolescent girls. If that's the case, it would be tough to communicate such a resonance, but Breillat finds ways to do so in Fat Girl that make the film an unsettling and often very consuming piece of work.Much has been made about the ending that is admittedly out of nowhere, able to shock the most hardened viewer raw because of its jolting nature, and implied to add ambiguity and an additional layer to the story. After several hours, where it has crossed my mind about every five minutes, I have not made up my mind on it. An amendment to the review will be made if I do. Perhaps it's a rare moment when an instance in a very great film happens that I'll never be able to define. Did I like it? Did I loathe it? Is it out of place? Does it derail the story?

However, Just Cause does practically the opposite, which makes this movie to be extremely surprising. You know, after seeing that Bobby's trial was solved in a matter of seconds, I kinda realized he was, in fact, the murderer, but that's what happens when you see a bunch of movies in your life-- you can predict almost everything. Another good point in this film is the way the suspense is built; in the first conversation between Armstrong and Sullivan, I almost had a heart attack when Sullivan yelled all of a sudden.

The off-screen story is every bit as incredible as the on-screen one &#x96; Herzog's exhausting quest to bring the film to life, shooting on location under the most taxing conditions, is the stuff of film-making folklore&#x85; every bit as extraordinary as the much- publicised tribulations experienced by Coppola when shooting Apocalypse Now. An artists' indomitable spirit in pursuit of his art occasionally throws up masterworks of this kind and, while the process of getting the film made very nearly tips these passionate individuals over the edge, the end results can be truly astounding. So it was with Apocalypse Now and so it is with Fitzcarraldo.Idealistic wannabe tycoon Brian Sweeney Fitzgerald (Klaus Kinski) is an ambitious Irishman living in turn-of-the-century South America. He is an ideas-man, but all too often his ideas come to nothing&#x85; such as his recent, aborted dream of building a Trans-Andean railway. Fitzgerald winds up in the ramshackle Amazonian city of Iquitos, where he earns the nickname 'Fitzcarraldo' as the locals are unable to correctly pronounce his name. One evening he makes the long and difficult journey downriver to the thriving city of Manaus to watch an opera featuring his idol, the great operatic legend Caruso. He is overwhelmed by the experience, and it makes him more determined than ever to pursue his long-held dream of building an opera house in Iquitos. To achieve the dream he needs money. The way to make money in turn-of-the-century Amazonia is to get involved in the lucrative rubber industry, but this is not an easy thing to do as virtually every area where rubber trees can be found has been snapped up by wealthy plantation owners. Fitzgerald discovers that there is one region still available for purchase further downstream, left alone by the wealthy tycoons as it lies beyond some dangerous and un-navigable rapids. Fitzgerald's incredible plan is to sail a steamboat down a parallel river, then drag the entire vessel over the dividing mountains at a point beyond the rapids. The quest takes him into hostile native territory, where he must somehow make contact with the untrusting Indians and persuade them to help him hoist the 300-ton ship over the slopes.Herzog's dynamic direction &#x96; working from his own script &#x96; really drives the film. He gets a masterful performance from Kinski as Fitzgerald, plus stunning visuals from his cinematographer Thomas Mauch. Reports suggest that Herzog and Kinski almost came to blows during the difficult shoot (one of the native extras allegedly offered to murder Kinski on Herzog's behalf!) but their fractious relationship has been cleverly channelled to bring out the best in both of them. Kinski's obsessed, wide-eyed dreamer is a mesmerising character, one of cinema's all-time greats, providing the actor with arguably the finest role of his career. Similarly, Herzog takes his art to a new level here &#x96; already a brilliant film-maker with a mightily impressive oeuvre to his name, he somehow goes a step farther with Fitzcarraldo &#x96; this is his masterpiece. Inspiring, fascinating, visually stunning and emotionally intense, Fitzcarraldo encapsulates everything that is great about cinema. One cannot fail to be stirred by Herzog's story of a man's unbridled determination to fulfil a dream&#x85; nor can one feel any less stirred by Herzog's own unbridled determination to complete his film against overwhelming odds. It is a marvel of a movie, a genuine must-see for anyone and everyone who loves the art of film.

Until information begins to spread that Raimus has gone awol and is heading for the American coast. Some believe that this is an act of desperation one in which will start world war III, but one man think hes has the answer CIA analyst Jack Ryan. With time running out and questions unanswered, desperation turns to acts of aggression, the hunt has begun....Based on the critically acclaimed novel by Tom Clancy, The Hunt for Red October is a tremendous nail biting suspense filled film. The story and pacing are superb as is the technological aspects of the film. Connery delivers an excellent performance, though some criticize the authenticity of a non soviet accent, this can easily be overlooked. The action is not without merit nor is the atmosphere of tension and intrigue by the viewer as you are transported to a silent deadly world of submarine warfare. Though some might argue that this film has a slow pace, it is deliberate as its strength lies in its plot, one in which is given time to mature. When the action begins you are that much more invested within the film. The score once again is perfect within the complexity of the film and to this day is one of the finest pseudo political\/warfare suspense films to date.

Mindless action, great characters, dime-novel romance, wonderful scenes and scenery, ridiculous premise, even more ridiculous action sequences, gender confusion (from the DVD cover, She's your man).And more, no message (OK, a really weak and fun one, capped by my favorite quote having to do with a cola-based soft drink), creditable acting, Ben Johnson AND Harry Carey Jr. Most of all, this film is visually highly original\/creative. I wonder sometimes how such a movie gets produced (like, how did Michael Nesmith get Repo Man out of the Hollywood grinder?).My DVD front cover lists Melanie Griffith and Ben Johnson but not David Andrews, who was excellent. A more well-known male lead would not have worked (in my opinion). Tim Thomerson's part is memorable. I enjoy the sci-fi back-references such as the cameo by the original GORT, a sci-fi tradition.I rate it a 7.5\/10, I put it on the same shelf as Legally Blond, and I play it when I just want G-rated entertainment (and no CGI). I liked Melanie Griffith's portrayal\/character a lot.

Not so sure getting to the end was that important, but I was morbidly curious to see how much worse it would get after such an abysmal beginning.I agree wholeheartedly with the reviewer who said that if you're going to do a musical, at least have the decency to have good songs. Every single one here is a loser, and a few perky, well-staged numbers may well have helped immeasurably. Some are worse than others, of course... Olive's He Needs Me may be the worst of the bunch, consisting mostly of he needs me... he needs me... da da da da da da... he needs me... da da da... The funereal Sweet Sweethaven stinks too, and then they go and use it more than once... thanks, folks. How did the feature-film musical version of Li'l Abner get everything so right bringing a cartoon world to life, and these people got everything so wrong? Credit where it's due Robin Williams does a very good job in a difficult role, and his singing voice is actually pretty good. Shelley Duval can't carry a tune in a bucket... not that they give her much of a tune to try and carry in the first place... but I'll give her this she sure looked the part. But if Jack Nicholson had showed up to chase her off the set with an axe, I wouldn't have minded.One thing that translated really, really badly from animation towards the end when semi-conscious Popeye has some canned spinach dumped into his mouth. Ugh. That was always a fun scene in a cartoon, but in real life there's nothing fun about watching a huge glob of lukewarm canned spinach land with a splot in an actor's wide-open mouth; the stuff is pretty disgusting on its own and that just took the cake. I almost gagged.One of my favorite character actors, Richard Libertini, was the thing I tried to focus on every time I felt myself losing the will to live. If he hadn't been there in the background so consistently, I might have just given up ten minutes in. He and Williams were the only decent things on the screen.If this isn't in the Bottom 100, someone should re-check the math.
