And I blame for that his stubbornness at staying with the old, the proved, but also the discarded. After all, it's part of movie History that by the early 1960s the traditional Western was as good as dead and that it was Leone who single handedly brought it back to life. So, it is a perplexing irony that the man charged of creating the most iconic character of the genre, the one who after him was crucial in creating a new Western, may have been also the only one not noticing the breathtaking change. After all, other U.S. filmmakers were at the time breaking new ground, experiencing with such daring movies as Butch Cassidy & Sundance Kid, Wild Bunch, etc. But I don't think that in Eastwood's case it was lack of awareness, but that he was simply trying to redeem himself in front of his conservative U.S. TV audience, after his Italian escapade--during which his Manco had broken every Hollywood convention; to show them that nothing had changed after all. But as Mrs. Sheen, Duvall, realized after their own AN escapade, doing movies for forgiveness doesn't really work, the resulting product being usually some contrived clunker. HTH follows the same protocol and it pays dearly for that, because it ends up being overdone, unoriginal, lame. Judging by what we see here, it would seem that by 1968 Eastwood wanted nothing to do with the film revolution he had been instrumental in unleashing and with the lasting icon he had created, El Manco.Basically HTH is just a throwback to older times when audiences were holding their breaths agonizing about the legality of what some generic sheriff was doing with his posse or about some cattle being properly branded; or wondering if the guys rotting in jail were really guilty...yawn. That's about this plot also. Cattle owner and former Marshall Cooper is mistakenly accused of murder & cattle rusting and hanged by a rogue posse. Miraculously, a traveling Marshall saves him. Then, as the truth comes out he's re--hired as a lawman and he'll spent the rest of the movie--when not chasing outlaws--arguing with people, from the judge above him to some other Marshall, to commoners, about the right way of enforcing the law. In that settings it's not surprising that, more than anything else, this movie feels like a pamphlet on good citizenry or at least as a simple remake of Ox Box Incident or some other classic--and not a very good one at that--rather than like an action & tension filled Western.But the worse thing about it is that it's preachy and manipulative, specially during that onion juice sprinkled picnic scene and during the collective hanging bit. Both episodes fail to convey any deep feeling, to communicate the desired emotions, because they feel to much the contrived--my Suspension of Disbelief Meter stayed stubbornly stuck at 0--so they both fall flat, as most of the flick. What makes things even worse is CE's clear intent of making us forget his Manco roles, which leads him to exaggerate the cleanliness and poise of his character. Always well dressed when about town, wearing just washed & ironed shirts, impeccable pants, immaculate hats...can you believe I spent more time watching in awe that wondrous hairdo than following the plot, the action, paying attention to the acting? That says more about this movie than anything else, I guess.Now, when a flick drags on the romance may come to save the day, but here even that doesn't work because that love story is simply BORING. I don't know about Stevens-maybe she was considered hot in the 60s--but here they both provide for what must be the lamest romantic couple in History, dethroning Cabaret's Minelli\/York and Eternal Sunshine's Winslet\/Carrey. And age got nothing to do with it in a similar role in Open Range, Annette Benning sets the screen on fire but here we see nothing of the kind. Her character is overloaded with pathos yet she plays it casually; nowhere her eyes, attitude, match what should be the cold resolve of her persevering endeavor which makes her look like just searching for some lost relative or like a preacher searching for lost souls--as Joan Collins in that Star Trek episode--which I thought is was the case! Furthermore her subplot gets no denouement, which makes it rather superfluous. The true mystery is why Eastwood's Cooper falls for her after all--maybe it's just that she brings out his inner lame-o. In any case, his final decision about keeping after the bad guys rather than staying with her, instead of looking and feeling as heartbreak, makes all the sense in the world.BTW, the only reason I saw and reviewed this one is because I found it in a 4-DVD set, with Leone's trilogy, under the description 4 Eastwood Classics.

The spread lines, here and there in the film, about striking a little nation and turning it back to the Stone Age as something the people of that nation, along with the Americans themselves, don't deserve at all is not a matter far from any other American war on other little nations. The link is more than tangible. See how it prognosticates, or reads well, the American war on Iraq with the last line of Let's broaden our influence in the middle east., said by one of the white house's wicked exacts, particularly after the peaceful termination that the Cuban-American situation ended up to.Choosing (Roger Donaldson) to take over the director's chair was a bit disappointing, maybe for him and sure for us. Because he's that clever pure action thriller director (No Way Out, The Getaway, Dante's Peak, The Recruit) he was out of his area for nearly all the time. Save the moment of picturing the missiles by fast planes, which was done astonishingly, (Donaldson) was manacled by endless conversations in closed rooms. I think he got board in way got to us as well.(Donaldson) couldn't handle the script the smart way it did with the thrill. There is a cold sense all over it. Most of the scenes is TV-ish with executive mark (standing men, talking in the oval office). Resorting to black and white image sometimes didn't give it any deepness or singularity. Add to that, not going into anyone's life or background else the president's consultant (played by the film's star and producer Kevin Costner).Using stock footage, from old documentaries or films, that show the Marines getting ready for war wasn't for the film's sake. The quality of their image contradicted highly with the so modern quality of the film's image. Therefore they looked so inharmonic, unlike the intended. Strangely the 44-year-old Bruce Greenwood looked older than the 45-year-old John F. Kennedy, and uglier. Poor Greenwood was also eaten by the presence of Costner and the character that was given to him; despite how many historical sources state that Kenny O'Donnell had no role in the crisis, and that it was in fact Ted Sorensen who pulled the administration together.A producer proves that he or she is distinct and bold by being enthusiastic for the different thing. (Costner) produced Dances with Wolves (1990) with a story about the old west, acted in Red Indian language, and ran for 3 hours when it was usual to refuse only the first part ! Knowing the nature of (Thirteen Days), being anything like the epical, flashy and meant to entertain other films he produced, such as Wyatt Earp (1994), Waterworld (1995), The Postman (1997), you have to respect the role he played to make a project like this see the light. This time he gives quite a testimony about an American leader's wisdom and leaning to piece, once. Let alone that testimony's impeccable timing. OK, Costner is not only distinct and bold, he also has a conscience. That's something rare to find in a producer in Hollywood ! Couple of years before this film, precisely on October 31, 1998, Bill Clinton signed a law which instituted a policy of regime change against Iraq. Although it explicitly stated it did not speak to the use of American military forces, Clinton launched a four-day bombing campaign, lasting from December 16 to December 19, 1998. The rest can be watched through George W. Bush's presidency, when Iraq was invaded for false accusations of owning nuclear arms. So if Clinton, Bush, or Obama didn't make themselves, and the world, a favor by watching and understanding the film that took place in their presidential house, then let me hope that next presidents would. However, obviously lately, stupidity, greed, or simply the arms dealers, don't want any similar critical situation to end in just 13 days. Enough to say that the one who managed to do it, John Kennedy, was killed in the next year (ironically after 13 months of the crises' start !). All the American propaganda films is about let's war, and how we're good at it. This one is about let's not war, and how we can do it good, making rare propaganda for rationality over madness. It is a good film about giant event. Despite being a bit cinematically pale, its strength comes from its well-made sensitive drama. And its uniqueness comes from being the history lesson that nearly nobody wanted \/ wants to listen to.

The spread lines, here and there in the film, about striking a little nation and turning it back to the Stone Age as something the people of that nation, along with the Americans themselves, don't deserve at all is not a matter far from any other American war on other little nations. The link is more than tangible. See how it prognosticates, or reads well, the American war on Iraq with the last line of Let's broaden our influence in the middle east., said by one of the white house's wicked exacts, particularly after the peaceful termination that the Cuban-American situation ended up to.Choosing (Roger Donaldson) to take over the director's chair was a bit disappointing, maybe for him and sure for us. Because he's that clever pure action thriller director (No Way Out, The Getaway, Dante's Peak, The Recruit) he was out of his area for nearly all the time. Save the moment of picturing the missiles by fast planes, which was done astonishingly, (Donaldson) was manacled by endless conversations in closed rooms. I think he got board in way got to us as well.(Donaldson) couldn't handle the script the smart way it did with the thrill. There is a cold sense all over it. Most of the scenes is TV-ish with executive mark (standing men, talking in the oval office). Resorting to black and white image sometimes didn't give it any deepness or singularity. Add to that, not going into anyone's life or background else the president's consultant (played by the film's star and producer Kevin Costner).Using stock footage, from old documentaries or films, that show the Marines getting ready for war wasn't for the film's sake. The quality of their image contradicted highly with the so modern quality of the film's image. Therefore they looked so inharmonic, unlike the intended. Strangely the 44-year-old Bruce Greenwood looked older than the 45-year-old John F. Kennedy, and uglier. Poor Greenwood was also eaten by the presence of Costner and the character that was given to him; despite how many historical sources state that Kenny O'Donnell had no role in the crisis, and that it was in fact Ted Sorensen who pulled the administration together.A producer proves that he or she is distinct and bold by being enthusiastic for the different thing. (Costner) produced Dances with Wolves (1990) with a story about the old west, acted in Red Indian language, and ran for 3 hours when it was usual to refuse only the first part ! Knowing the nature of (Thirteen Days), being anything like the epical, flashy and meant to entertain other films he produced, such as Wyatt Earp (1994), Waterworld (1995), The Postman (1997), you have to respect the role he played to make a project like this see the light. This time he gives quite a testimony about an American leader's wisdom and leaning to piece, once. Let alone that testimony's impeccable timing. OK, Costner is not only distinct and bold, he also has a conscience. That's something rare to find in a producer in Hollywood ! Couple of years before this film, precisely on October 31, 1998, Bill Clinton signed a law which instituted a policy of regime change against Iraq. Although it explicitly stated it did not speak to the use of American military forces, Clinton launched a four-day bombing campaign, lasting from December 16 to December 19, 1998. The rest can be watched through George W. Bush's presidency, when Iraq was invaded for false accusations of owning nuclear arms. So if Clinton, Bush, or Obama didn't make themselves, and the world, a favor by watching and understanding the film that took place in their presidential house, then let me hope that next presidents would. However, obviously lately, stupidity, greed, or simply the arms dealers, don't want any similar critical situation to end in just 13 days. Enough to say that the one who managed to do it, John Kennedy, was killed in the next year (ironically after 13 months of the crises' start !). All the American propaganda films is about let's war, and how we're good at it. This one is about let's not war, and how we can do it good, making rare propaganda for rationality over madness. It is a good film about giant event. Despite being a bit cinematically pale, its strength comes from its well-made sensitive drama. And its uniqueness comes from being the history lesson that nearly nobody wanted \/ wants to listen to.

It employs many techniques that would become common practice without the untrained eye's notice. One of the main attractions to the film playing to the sound category would be its luscious soundtrack. It featured songs by various artists of The Band, The Jimi Hendrix Experience, and Steppenwolf, and much more. The music in the film in a word represents the search for 'freedom'. Note that the songs are always played as the duo of Dennis Hopper (Billy) and Peter Fonda (Wyatt) is on the road. The songs not only represent a specific time in our nation's history, at the peak of the late sixties psychedelic rock, but it it's also meant to enhance the natural beauty of the many landmarks they see on their journey. It creates a dream-like state of innocence because we are not shown the dull grays of the skyscrapers we're accustomed to. This adds to the idea of a secure purity thru simplicity as a bit of subtle symbolism as the two 'nomads' as they encounter various 'simple folk' in the form of country people and hippies.Another, and perhaps one of the most important components of sound in a movie, is the delivery of its dialogue. It's not just the lines themselves, although that's not to be reduced to negligence because films like the Transformers and Pearl Harbor (2001), tow popular Michael Bay films, specialize as all his films do in on-the-nose dialogue. On-the-nose dialogue finds it annoyingly necessary to repeatedly restate the obvious and try to level with the slow audience members who can't keep track of what's going on. This wears old quickly, and by the time one gets to the third film in the Transformers franchise you can literally predict each line. Peter Fonda's writing and direction are much more artistic and ambiguous, to my joy. Note the subtext of each voice in the film. Consider how Jack Nicholson's character is constantly rambling on in a drunken or intoxicated manner. It adds comedic contrast to the quest of the two other main characters, and yet it adds even more in the scene just before his murder. The characters are almost like children on a simple camping trip, chattering over the most random yet down to earth conversation ever. They speak of extraterrestrial beings, but really the whole scene is about the possibility of life beyond Earth, about the whole scope of man's miniscule stature in this familiar world; the kinetic curiosity of men wondering about things that which the y may never fully understand. When the group is attacked and suffer a heart-breaking casualty, the scenes prior make the moment truly heart breaking.One of the seemingly most vague lines in the film is delivered near its climax, where despite the all the money they've made Wyatt reflects on it all and can only say 'We blew it. It takes a deep internal inspection of not just the film itself but of one's own morality and conception of the world to pull any sense of it. In a similar fashion that Richard Kelly used in Donnie Darko (2001), I believe the theme of the film can breed a multitude of interpretations. For myself, I believe it was the search for a greater benevolent force behind the ugly violence that is the world. In a sense it was a quest for a certain sense of nirvana, specifically for Wyatt, who observed the simplified life of the strangers they met and marveled at them. Note how his friend always rushed but he always insisted on staying at each destination a little longer. That was his inner unseen motive that drove him, and the main reason why the character spent so much of the film on drugs. The LSD scene for example, you see him in the arms of a religious statue, perhaps suggesting in a somewhat nihilistic sense that in the desperate search for enlightenment sometimes all a man can do is turn to a distorted view of the world he himself created (thru the drugs obviously). The film ends on a bitter and tragic note because despite his well meaning, Wyatt never receives the spiritual enlightenment he was searching for.Of course I could also go into how the film subtly critiques the values of the so called freedom we have in America, but that'd be another essay in itself.

I have to say after watching a couple of them I feel the list needs tearing up and starting over.To Kill A Mockingbird is a famous book written by Harper Lee. She won the Pulitzer Prize for her writing and I believe that this is the reason the film is deemed a classic as I have to say I found it utterly dull and boring.Gregory Peck plays Atticus Finch, a lawyer who looks after his kids alone after the death of his wife. The beginning of the film is from the point of view of his daughter Scout, who plays in the street and has a good relationship with her brother Jem. They have a belief that a man who lives down the street is actually insane and they taunt this man by sneaking onto his property and banging on his door. The fun of being a youth hey. Their fun soon changes though when their Dad is offered the job of defending a black man who is accused of rape. Due to them living in a racist era the town's folk don't take too kindly to Atticus defending a clearly 'guilty' black man and they intend to make his life hell. Their kids fight Atticus' kids, they lynch mob the police station and threaten Atticus and they all lose great respect for this man and his family. As the film gets to the trial we see the children losing a part of their innocence as they realise there is evil in this world.The trial scenes are not as tense as they should have been and they take all the attention away from the children. For forty minutes or so they are barely in a shot. Atticus tries to defend the black man, Tony Robinson and although he is clearly innocent he faces a losing battle against an all white jury. Tony is killed after the trial and the father of the man Tony apparently raped, goes after Atticus' children.I won't tell you what happens after as I wouldn't want to give away an ending of a classic, although if you listen to me I wouldn't bother watching it. People will though due to its status in society and I am aware that it conveys a meaningful message, especially for the era it was released in but the whole ending throws out the principal Atticus is fighting at the beginning. The film to me is just a mess. I know the book is a classic and no I haven't read it but that doesn't make the film a good one. It is just plain boring.I had this problem a while back whilst watching another film voted as one of the greatest of all time Citizen Kane. Oh my, that film must have been the most boring film I've ever seen, it was painful to watch and I felt tears streaming down my face. This wasn't quite as bad but it is one of those classic films that people of today won't get, especially if they are under thirty.I have no problem with the acting in it. Gregory Peck is very good as Atticus and there are a few good scenes that I found myself interested in but very quickly I would be falling asleep again. Maybe I'm not appreciating what is supposed to be beautiful about this movie but to me there is absolutely nothing.Disappointed to say the least but there is one thing To Kill A Mockingbird has taught me, to not trust the 'All Time Greatest Movie' lists that are around unless of course they actually have something about them, like The Shawshank Redemption for instance.

Basically, set in Rome in the 1st Century, Encolpio (Martin Potter) and Ascilto (Hiram Keller) are student friends arguing about ownership of the boy Gitone (Max Born), so they have to split up their belongings and split up. Gitone has to decide who to be with, and he chooses Ascilto, and when he threatens suicide Escolpio is stopped by an earthquake. We follow Escolpio going through a series of adventures, until Ascilto and he are eventually reunited, and they help a man enter a temple and kidnap a hermaphrodite demi-god. The death of the god causes Escolpio to be punished and he also becomes impotent, and we are following them trying to find a cure for it. Okay, I will be absolutely honest in saying that I didn't remember everything that happened in this film, and even though I did watch it all and can recall bits and pieces I didn't understand much of it.

Also they left out some nudity and gore so it's low on everything a slasher needs. You only see the result of his killings, now and then you actually see the killing itself.

This is Stanley Kubrick's first Big Movie. It largely succeeds as entertainment -- complete with Entr'acte -- because its colorful, splashy, and Kubruck is still in touch with his human roots. He was soon to be absorbed by technology as a food particle is absorbed by an amoeba.In brief, Douglas is Spartacus who, in the years before Christ, was a slave trained as a gladiator. He led a revolt and marched his army to Bridisium (now Brindisi) where ships were supposed to be waiting to spirit him and his thousand followers out of the country to freedom. The pirates who were to man the ships were bought out by Spartacus's enemies in Rome, leaving Spartacus trapped between two or three Roman armies led by the nasty and determined patrician Lawrence Olivier. Spartacus's men put up a good fight but they lose and all are crucified. That's why I don't watch the last ten minutes or so. Before his own torture and death, Spartacus is forced to kill the harmless Tony Curtis, his best friend. And when Spartacus is strung up there, his girl friend, Jean Simmons, looks up at him and begs him to die. That, I don't need.In fact, with the exception of two scenes -- the exhilarating rebellion at the gladiator school and the pastoral love scene at the pond between Douglas and Simmons -- it's pretty tragic all around. It's as if John Brown had succeeded in freeing the slaves in the South, then went around looting plantations, having a good time, and causing all sorts of discomfort until, finally, Washington sent the army down, led by Robert E. Lee, and crushed him. I don't know how closely the story matches historical reality but, if I remember, the march to Brindisi wasn't all wine and roses. Spartacus had a falling out with his friend and colleague Crixus and the group split up, didn't they? There's a hilarious conversation between Olivier and his body servant, Curtis, while Olivier is in the bath. It was cut from the first release print but has been restored. Do you like oysters?, queries Olivier. When I can get them, Master, replies Curtis, who is tenderly washing Olivier's back. Do you like snails? No, Master. You see, it's a matter of taste. I myself enjoy both oysters and snails. (Something like that.) It's all code for homosexuality, which was not exactly unknown, let alone condemned as immoral, in Ancient Rome. As a matter of fact, without any particular interest in the subject, I noticed among the principals in the cast one who was thoroughly committed to snails, one who apparently enjoyed both snails and oysters, and one who preferred oysters although he'd tried snails at least once. I can't speak for the supporting players or the thousand extras.Douglas does okay by the heroic but unlucky Spartacus. Jean Simmons is a nice lady but, once out of adolescence in Dickens and Shakespeare, she seemed mundane. Woody Strode, of all people, has a marvelous scene. (Strode's character, a gladiator, has hardly any lines.) He's sitting in the bull pen with Douglas. The two men, who are fellow slaves, are about to be forced to fight to the death for the enjoyment of a couple of really slimy aristos. We can hear the clang of swords from the arena outside and the gasps of the crowd. Strode and Douglas don't say a word. Douglas is biting his tongue and staring at Strode, and Strode slowly looks sideways at him with the sweetest, gentlest, most enigmatic smile you can imagine. It only last a minute but it's the best minute that Woody Strode ever committed to celluloid.The winner of tonight's prize of a whole Smithfield ham must be divided between Lord Lawrence Olivier, as the rabid Patrician who wants to be dictator, and Peter Ustinov as the comical and servile brown noser -- Oh, yes, whatever you wish, Your Pulchritude. The two fight like gladiators to upstage one another.According to Kirk Douglas, who was Executive Producer, there was some argument over who should get writing credit on the movie. Dalton Trumbo had, after all, been blacklisted during the McCarthy era. Did they dare give Trumbo screen credit. Maybe not, but then who would get it? Should they invent a fake name? Kubrick, in all seriousness, piped up with, Use my name. I'll take the credit. Douglas was disgusted.The score by Alex North is loud and martial, except for a saccharine love them associated with Spartacus and Varinia, but it's uninspired. I'd have preferred the borscht that was always served up by Dmitri Tiomkin -- those cow bells and flatulent trombones -- but North's score is an improvement over the ominous chords of Miklos Rozsa.It's a decent movie with some fine scenes in it but, Lordy, it's depressing.
