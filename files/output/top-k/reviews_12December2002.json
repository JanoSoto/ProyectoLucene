[{"date":"12 December 2002","score":"","review":" Ya gotta rent this film. It is written well, acted well and this is how satire is supposed to be. I loved everyone in this film, especially Reese Witherspoon. It was wonderful watching her go from innocent over-achiever to driven over-achiever. Matthew Broderick also was perfect as the teacher who watched students year after year and finally come across Little Miss Over-Achieving Know-it-all. It didn't help that his personal life was on a thin string either. Although this was about a high school election, I feel that if more Americans watched this film before voting in the 2000 Presidential election, there would have been a totally different outcome that what we had. This film is a good example for all adults that once your out of high school, you never actually out of  high school. Don't understand what I mean? Watch this film, and you'll understand completely.
