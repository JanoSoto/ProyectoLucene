Based upon vision alone, it is a landmark in film history.Now along comes DARK CITY -- a film that is so brilliant and so compelling, is so meticulously imagined and lovingly crafted, that it deserves a spot on the podium next to BLADE RUNNER.  Really, it's that good.  It's easily one of the top 10 films of the 90s.The film opens in an unnamed city that looks as murky as the L.A. of BLADE RUNNER, but with a definite period twist -- we could be in New York or Chicago circa the 1920s, or in Berlin, or the city in METROPOLIS.  We discover a young man asleep in a bathtub; he awakens in a confused state and discovers the mutilated body of a young woman in the next room.  He can't remember his name.  He doesn't know where he is.  And so begins his adventure in the dark city as he slowly unravels his true identity, the true identities of those he (thinks he) loves, and the world they inhabit.There's not a bad performance in DARK CITY.  Rufus Sewell is exceptional as John Murdoch.  Jennifer Connelly is perfect (and stunning as usual) as his wife.  William Hurt fits into his role as the police inspector, Bumstead, like a foot into an old shoe.  Kiefer Sutherland delivers what will probably be considered to be one of his finest performances, as Dr. Schreber.  And Colin Friels deserves special recognition for his amazing work as Bumstead's colleague, Wallenski.But the real credit for this great movie goes to Alex Proyas and his production designers.  Aside from the compelling story, every scene is meticulously crafted.  Proyas pays homage to several predecessors, including BLADE RUNNER and principally METROPOLIS and NOSFERATU, but the homages never feel like plagerism -- DARK CITY is its own film, with its own unique vision.Is DARK CITY perfect?  Of course not.  Its last 15 minutes are somewhat clunky as the protagonist faces off against his nemeses.  The closing scene is a tad *too* sunny.  But these are *very* minor complaints.

This movie is a reminder of not only the true atrocities of our human nature, but of the ultimate perseverance of our humanity, of what makes us who we are, of a spirit that is unheard, yet undiminished. It is a saddening, yet powerful experience for me.That Djimon Hounsou didn't get nominated for every award on the planet, including the most recognized Academy Award baffles me. His performance in this film is the most dynamic portrayal of any role I have ever seen. Breathtakingly powerful. I don't know of any other performance in my lifetime that even comes close. His dedication to the role is enough to garner my unwavering admiration. He learned Mende, Cinque's spoken tongue, for the film, and when listening to him speak, he does it with such a superb natural timing that it is hard to imagine it isn't the language he grew up withe. That is talent, plain and simple. The supporting cast, as well, is superb. Anthony Hopkins completely transforms into his character until there is nothing of him left, except for his abilities. Morgan Freeman may just be the most talented actor on the planet. He never fails to give a less than stellar performance, and his role in Amistad is flawless. Although, I believe his character should have been more vital to the story and less of a supporting player. He was criminally underutilized. That fact is my only grievance with the movie. The rest I find impeccable. The rest of the cast, Stellan Skarsgard, Nigel Hawthorne, Jeremy Northam, Razaaq Adoti, Anna Paquin, Pete Postlethwaite, and even Matthew McConaughey, all play out there roles with a defining authenticity that I find lacking in many recent historical dramas. Bringing a true story to life means disaster for some films, but this one does a remarkable job of remaining a good film behind the historical facts it is based on.There are two particular scenes in the film that bring me to tears every time I see them the first is one where Cinque is telling John Quincy Adams of his ancestors. The second is probably the most beautifully scripted speech in recent history, and Hopkin's delivery is graceful and eloquent, near perfection. This movie may not have all the right elements to make it a critical success, but it has what it takes to affect my way of thinking, my outlook on life, and my hope that the human spirit will always remain unconquerable, will always triumph over those who would deny it freedom.

The rest of the cast, Stellan Skarsgard, Nigel Hawthorne, Jeremy Northam, Razaaq Adoti, Anna Paquin, Pete Postlethwaite, and even Matthew McConaughey, all play out there roles with a defining authenticity that I find lacking in many recent historical dramas. Bringing a true story to life means disaster for some films, but this one does a remarkable job of remaining a good film behind the historical facts it is based on.There are two particular scenes in the film that bring me to tears every time I see them the first is one where Cinque is telling John Quincy Adams of his ancestors. The second is probably the most beautifully scripted speech in recent history, and Hopkin's delivery is graceful and eloquent, near perfection. This movie may not have all the right elements to make it a critical success, but it has what it takes to affect my way of thinking, my outlook on life, and my hope that the human spirit will always remain unconquerable, will always triumph over those who would deny it freedom.

The story picks up right where Part II's cliffhanger ended Marty McFly (Micheal J.

When Marty discovers that Doc is shot a few days after his postmarks a letter to Marty, McFly decides to disobey Doc's wishes, go back in time, and save Doc from his fate. It is much easier to explain if you see Part II (all the movies, actually). I was kind of letdown by Part II's lack of humor but I am glad to see that it has been restored in III. Doc and Marty have some great lines and the overall tone of the Wild West in 1885 is light and fun (Marty's alias is Clint Eastwood). Both Chistopher Lloyd and Fox are fine is roles they have become quite familiar with. The only problem is Mary Steenburgen, who plays Clara, the love interest of Doc and one of the deciding factors on wether or not he should leave.

The film professes an end to the sequels, but at $100 million average box office per movie, frankly I'm skeptical.  The first three `Friday the 13th' movies didn't gross $100 million between them, and now twenty years later, they are producing number ten.This film didn't traverse any new ground, continuing from `Scream 2' with the movie within a movie concept.  Though Craven still presents a droll and effective story, he has stopped innovating.  He simply continues to present us with good but jaded themes.It seems the gore has been toned down for this film, which is probably not a bad thing.  The story answered all sorts of questions about the first film that no one had.  I suppose they needed to create questions so they could make a movie to answer them.  I didn't find Ehren Kruger's writing to be up to the standard set by Kevin Williamson.  Williamson's humor was much more sophisticated and astute whereas Kruger settled for low brow sarcastic sniping and tongue in cheek humor.The whole cast delivered a collectively enjoyable performance, although with the paranoid and overwrought way that Sidney was written, Neve Campbell couldn't have had much fun.  Courtney Cox was funny and flaky as ever as Gale Weathers as was hubby David Arquette.  The rest of the ensemble including Patrick Dempsey, Emily Mortimer, Liev Schreiber, Scott Foley, and Parker Posey and a host of other victims all did a terrific job.I enjoyed this slightly more than Scream 2, but much less than the original.  I rated it a 7\/10.  Craven's once fresh approach to horror is still good, but it is starting to get threadbare.  If there is going to be a fourth installment in the trilogy (would that be a quadology?), Craven needs to get creative again and take the genre to the next level or risk running out of gas.

Ever since then I've been intrigued by the whole ancient egyptian thing.  Now, this movie does get down right ridiculous towards the end, but if I wanted reality I would sit on my front porch and watch my neighbors mow their lawn (for free.)  As ridiculous as it gets, the acting is really good.  The humor is contemporary, and so out of place; but I'm willing to make that leap for the sake of a good laugh.Here's were I start to spoil it a bit.  I really got to say that I thought the acting was really authentic.  I have never seen anyone stutter as convincingly as Rick when he was giving Evie the tools he stole - and the look on his face...he really looked nervous.  In fact the facial expressions were really bang on for nearly everyone.  The evil smile of Vasloo was perfect.  When he did the plane swallowing sand\/body wave thing...that was wierd, but cool.  He was totally into it.  Like an evil dude would be.  In all fairness, The mumbled stutters Evie forced out when the claw guy asked her for the map sounded very real.  They could rival Rick's tool gift stutters.  Speaking of real, how do you make it look like someone is running into a wall full speed, head first? I don't know, but they do.This movie had a nice amount of humor sprinkled throughout.  Some of the best lines you should hear are...sounds like.....bugs.  The facial really did it for me on that one.  I was surprised how funny Fraser could be.  The air kiss was a hoot.  That happens alot around here -was well placed. Other great lines are...what's that God awful stench?-Oh, also You don't have any children-I might some day, and Wait here I'll go get help. This is the kind of humor that, I (being intelligent yet silly) can laugh at over and over. They picked the right people for the roles in this movie.  Benny was a total weasel.  I hope I don't offend him, but this guy yelled weasel from his sandals to his hat.  His voice, his lines, his stance, his smile- he was the perfect weasel.  Jonathan (the brother) was great.  There wasn't a moment I didn't believe this guy.  Speaking of guys how many good looking men can you fit in one movie?  I counted at least four.  The magi leader was a babe. (Also, I appreciated that they spoke Egyptian were appropriate.)  Now if you're talking babe material- truthfully I first saw the movie because it had mummy in the title and I knew Fraser (God's gift to us women) was in it. But- the last four times I saw it were mostly for Vasloo.  Where did this guy come from and does he have any brothers?  Yow-za!  You gotta envy Evie when she has Rick(a modern John Wayne with a splash of Tom Hanks) and Imohtep (a gorgeous face on top of an 'ouch' body) fighting over her.I heard about the sequal and I'm definitely gonna see it, but one thing...according to the films at the Museum of Natural History (Smithsonian), they don't remove your heart during mummification. ","genre":null},{"date":"5 August 2000","score":"","review":"  This movie has become one of my favorites.  I used to stay up late to watch the old mummy movies when I was a kid.  Ever since then I've been intrigued by the whole ancient egyptian thing.  Now, this movie does get down right ridiculous towards the end, but if I wanted reality I would sit on my front porch and watch my neighbors mow their lawn (for free.)  As ridiculous as it gets, the acting is really good.  The humor is contemporary, and so out of place; but I'm willing to make that leap for the sake of a good laugh.Here's were I start to spoil it a bit.  I really got to say that I thought the acting was really authentic.  I have never seen anyone stutter as convincingly as Rick when he was giving Evie the tools he stole - and the look on his face...he really looked nervous.  In fact the facial expressions were really bang on for nearly everyone.  The evil smile of Vasloo was perfect.  When he did the plane swallowing sand\/body wave thing...that was wierd, but cool.  He was totally into it.  Like an evil dude would be.  In all fairness, The mumbled stutters Evie forced out when the claw guy asked her for the map sounded very real.  They could rival Rick's tool gift stutters.  Speaking of real, how do you make it look like someone is running into a wall full speed, head first? I don't know, but they do.This movie had a nice amount of humor sprinkled throughout.  Some of the best lines you should hear are...sounds like.....bugs.  The facial really did it for me on that one.  I was surprised how funny Fraser could be.  The air kiss was a hoot.  That happens alot around here -was well placed. Other great lines are...what's that God awful stench?-Oh, also You don't have any children-I might some day, and Wait here I'll go get help. This is the kind of humor that, I (being intelligent yet silly) can laugh at over and over. They picked the right people for the roles in this movie.  Benny was a total weasel.  I hope I don't offend him, but this guy yelled weasel from his sandals to his hat.  His voice, his lines, his stance, his smile- he was the perfect weasel.  Jonathan (the brother) was great.  There wasn't a moment I didn't believe this guy.  Speaking of guys how many good looking men can you fit in one movie?  I counted at least four.  The magi leader was a babe. (Also, I appreciated that they spoke Egyptian were appropriate.)  Now if you're talking babe material- truthfully I first saw the movie because it had mummy in the title and I knew Fraser (God's gift to us women) was in it.
