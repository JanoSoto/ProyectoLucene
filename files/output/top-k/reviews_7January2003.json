We hardly see the aliens, but they are constantly felt around the protagonist. It worked for Ridley Scott in `Aliens' and its working quite good for Shyamalan.(small spoilers - coming up)Mel Gibson's kids are scary as hell. They have lost their mother, and as the fargo-like policewoman says ` has gone through a lot'. Even considering that, they are still very `stiff' in their performance. However I think this was intended from the director's side, since it gives them an eerie radiance - almost as if them being kids makes them more susceptible to the alien's communication. Never the less - it doesn't seam realistic that kids should behave like that, not even if they were brought up the way they are (by a strict reverend).(Big spoilers coming up)Considering the genre, I very much like the idea that the aliens are not portrayed as the superior beings we are used to. Instead they are portrayed as being desperate and almost weak. That itself pulls my rating up, since it helps nuance the idea of extra terrestrial life.Also the revenge motive attributed to the alien scout that Gibson mutilates, gives the visitors a more `human' touch.However The way that Gibsons character loses his belief doesn't convince me. And the whole idea about preordained destiny I loathe. The movie implies not only that Gibson lost his wife so that he later would save his son, but also that Phoenix baseball career had the same purpose (cf. scene in military office).The way the ending plays out shows such hesitation from all involved that one doubts it's realistic. However  - considering that the alien most likely was left behind, and the terror the humans are in - maybe.That the alien has poison coming out of its arms, does not imply hunting (as for instance a snake) but rather some form of bio-bodyarmour, which we cannot see.All these weaknesses can however also be attributed to the high amount of water in the atmosphere that maybe weakens them.The way human fear is portrayed is humorous, and a good reminder of our irrational approach to things. On the same account it gives the audiance a needed breather from the heavy \/ horror stuff.Because of the less than creditable account of a reverends faith and the fate\/destiny theme, I was constantly annoyed. From that I give 6\/10.However - If you are willing to buy that stuff, its at least 7, maybe 8\/10.To pull the movie down because of unrealistic aliens, is to speculate about things we can't speculate about.

Sandra Bullock (Siddalee Walker) does an alright job in this movie.  I've seen her act better.  In fact at times she made me think --- boring.  But she had her moments, and I think Bullock is more of a comedic actress.  She was better at the comedy parts of the movie instead of the more serious. Ellen Burstyn plays Vivi Walker, mother of Siddalee with a past brought up by an interview of Siddalee in Time Magazine.  Burstyn's role is also just so-so.  I would have liked to see more of her throughout the movie, but we got what we got. I would have to say that the one role which stuck out the most, for the better, was the role of younger Vivi played by Ashley Judd.  She did a wonderful job making the character convincing, at the happy times and the bad times.  I just thought this character was the most well rounded and best acted in the movie. Rounding out the cast was James Garner, Angus MacFadyen, Maggie Smith, Cherry Jones, Shirley Knight, Fionnula Flanagan, Matthew Settle, and David Lee Smith. Just a little note --- David Lee Smith plays the younger Shep Walker in The Divine Secrets of The Ya-Ya Sisterhood.  This film was also filmed around and in the same location as A Walk To Remember.

His role of Ryan Woodman really didn't let him shine as an actor.  His next role to follow this, Get Over It, seemed even worse than the role in Whatever It Takes.  I'd have to say that if you want to see Shane at his best you should check out A Walk To Remember.   In Whatever It Takes you really want everything to work out for Ryan.  Yes, the movie is as cheesy as it gets, but if you overlook that, and some bad acting, you get a semi-decent movie. Marla Sokoloff does a good job of making her character Maggie Carter down to earth and real.  I believe she has one of the stronger roles in this movie, although I really want to see Marla in better movie roles.  She is a great actress on the tv show The Practice, but her movie roles haven't been top notch.  She played Wilma, the twin of Jennifer Garner's Wanda, in the 2000 flop Dude, Where's My Car.  Following that she played Lisa in Sugar & Spice, another flop.  Many of Marla's acting attempts on the big screen have been flops, and I hope she doesn't get grouped into that corny teen actor genre --- such as stars like Freddie Prinze, Jr. and Jason Biggs have. Jodi Lyn O'Keefe plays popular and mean girl Ashley Grant.  Ahh yes, another popular and mean girl.  Every teen movie has to have at least one.  She takes it overboard in this movie.  I think the role was just written to be overboard.  I just feel sorry for Jodi Lyn who seems to be grouped into that corny teen actor genre I listed above.  Poor Jodie was Taylor in She's All That where she played Freddie Prinze, Jr.'s popular and mean ex girlfriend.  I see a real talent in Ms. O'Keefe, but I think she should stay away from these types of roles she is best known for. Finally, rounding out the cast is James Franco, pretty face and bad boy spirit.  Best known as playing James Dean (another pretty face with bad boy spirit) in 2001's TV Movie of the same title as the character he plays, he just doesn't seem to be that strong of an actor in Whatever It Takes.  But that's okay because none of the actors were that strong in their acting, but they have the potential to be better, with some of them already proving they are better than this (Shane West).  This was also one of Franco's first movies so that may be another reason the acting wasn't as strong as it could be. The movie's plot was a modern day Cyrano DeBergerac.  This concept seems like it would have worked well, but I think the script was poorly written.  Most teen movies do have poor written scripts, but I think this was one of the poorest of them all.  But all actors and actresses learn and grow from their early work, and I'm sure all of these actors and actresses will go on to have great carreers in the future.1 of 4 stars.

When watching movies that don't concern immediate action or comedic values picked up by the audience, you have to actually take on an almost hidden mentality where you can decide yourself what message each scene is trying to tell you. Wes Anderson's films have a grand, refreshing and oddly independent feel to them. The continuum of his type of direction can sometimes reflect the characters in his movies These people don't really seem to care, nor are they striving to break through in any mainstream way just because they care too dearly what everyone else thinks of their success. The Royal Tenenbaums really stresses the entertainment in actually watching movies instead of just viewing them. When I say just viewing I mean sitting down and going through a movie and not letting yourself comprehend anything further than the dialogue and action that follows. There are still a lot of people who don't care to actually expand their appeals further than today's filmmakers drawing every meaning and aspect of the film out in crayon.Wes Anderson strictly constructs this film in a very orderly manner that relieves today's true movie lovers. From the introduction of all the characters back in 1979 (and the violin laden introduction of all the characters 22 years later) to the ending of the film where Gene Hackman found his peace with his family and carrying it with him at the end of his life, the movie does a good job of leading on emotional value. People who say the movie is too serious and then too quirky don't realize that its nothing but a strong balance of a character study. The Tenenbaum family are definitely off the wall, and also emotionally challenged, but their parents didn't so much raise them on love as much as they did to deem them brilliant. Even the actors outside the family, such as Owen Wilson, Bill Murray, and Danny Glover, seem to add comedy to the film, especially Bill Murray, who doesn't even have to try to be funny in this movie. The Luke Wilson suicide attempt scene was probably the most compelling scenes I've ever seen in a movie because I understood through his character study just how twisted his life was at that point, and Elliot Smith's Needle in the Hay really added to the scene for a reason I'm not sure, but then again the whole soundtrack went with the movie so well.

Once the movie hits the 20-minute mark, the notion of plot completely disappears.  But I loved the special f\/x, which immensely surprised me, knowing the budget was only $375,000.00.

It should have had a lot more sex.And a few of the scenes were, for me, unacceptable and far fetched. I couldn't suspend belief for everything the husband did when he found out. I suppose people can go a bit crazy when their partners cheat. People are stupid sometimes. Its just sex, and a bit of lying. Nothing that can't be sorted out with the right approach, and creative, honest thinking.One more thing, there should have been more and better sex. It's not where you have sex, it's how, and they just didn't explore that enough.

Even today, I find most of the episodes (excluding those featuring the ANNOYING Scrappy-Doo) to be enjoyable in a mindless sort of way.

Honestly, Prinze is a wooden, charmless actor who has no real onscreen presence.

I guess I shouldn't have been too disappointed about this movie (considering how difficult it must have been to remake a 33-year-old cartoon show as a major Hollywood film), but so much more could have been done.Some other notes about Scooby-Doo-the best part of the movie was easily Matthew Lillard.  His impression of Shaggy was dead-on, from the look of the character to the voice and mannerisms.  I'll bet he made Casey Kasem (voice of the original Shaggy) proud.-the visual effects were impressive, as well as the special effects. Then again, the film (with no real A-list stars) cost $84 million to make, so it should have looked good.-I thought the CGI Scooby looked very good, considerng there was nothing else the producers could have done to make him look realistic in a non-animated film (Large animatronic puppet?  Person in an oversized Scooby suit?  No way).  I only wish that Don Messick had lived long enough to provide Scooby's voice for this movie.  Messick was *THE* voice of Scooby-Doo, and he cannot be replaced by anyone.-was the farting contest between Scooby and Shaggy really necessary?  I know little kids (the target audience for this movie) would find it really funny, and the use of gross-out humor (a la American Pie) is widespread in comedies today.  But I thought this was a little bit too much.-I don't understand why Freddie Prinze Jr. is so popular (true, he is young and good-looking, but there are so many other actors who fit in those two categories).  Honestly, Prinze is a wooden, charmless actor who has no real onscreen presence.  Only Prinze could screw up in the role of Fred (who is SUPPOSED to be bland and superficial), and just hearing him speak in this movie irritated me.  Note to Freddie your career may be red hot right now, but once your youthful looks disappear...-Linda Cardellini is hot.  That is all.Overall, Scooby-Doo is not a horrible film, but watching three episodes of the original Scooby-Doo, Where Are You! would be more entertaining than watching this one movie.

Well, here's what I have to say Armageddon is WORTH WATCHING. It's a very well done movie, with amazing special effects, an amazing script, and amazing talent. Bruce Willis is great in this movie, so are Billy Bob Thornton, Liv Tyler and Ben Affleck. It's refreshing to see a cast that works so well together, unlike other movies I've seen. The script is very well done . . . I have absolutely no qualms with the script. The script was humorous when it needed to be, and heart-wrenching when it needed to be. If you hate this movie, take another look.
