I saw this movie for a piece of history, and as anyone who has even a passing acquaintance with the era would be, I was curious about one of the primary forces behind it. Well, I got something else. I got a little psychological tale set inside the head of a major political figure.The film can possibly be analysed and revealed to have several layers and sub-texts, but I found it to be essentially the story of a woman coming to terms with being Queen. A tad obvious as analyses go, I know, but really that's what this movie is. And it is terrific just for that.Cate Blanchett romps through this film. She seems to go under the skin of the character and come out on the other side, as she oscillates from vulnerable maiden to monarch, from soft beauty to ice maiden, from girl to monarch, from uncertain to ruthless. It's pretty much a blast watching her as she slowly but steadily comes to terms with the nasty little job she has inherited.And no, it's not that she is in any way uncertain about wanting the job. That's what I loved about the movie - Elizabeth clearly loves her job, she wants it, and is never coy about that. But she must pay the required price and she does in terms of the life she eventually has to live. She inherits her power but eventually also earns it. She probably succeeded as a Queen because she was a real pro about it.Shekhar Kapur does a good job - his style is a sort of invisible one. He is almost not there, he seems to have put it all together and then nimbly jumped off the set. Half his work is done in his casting decisions as it should be in a 'dramatic' film - the biggest one of all being Blanchett. What's more he doesn't seem loathe to add a little extra drama to the film, and that really works. The acting, the camera work and the staging of the movie have just a bit of an excessive quality about, but it never goes wrong a) because, this is after all a story about royalty, about powerful people taking decisions that affect entire nations, and these are after all very grave matters and b) because of the stellar cast involved.-----Possible spoilers ahead---- The settings and costumes also help, of course, and the camera work seems to have a fly on the wall quality about it as it wanders through the somehow forbidden private world of England's royalty. But this film is finally about the performances. Geoffrey Rush is subtle, classy and slimy all at the same time. Joseph Fiennes is the nice lover to the point where you start hating him for his 'niceness', and his character is always an echo of what Elizabeth feels for him at that particular point in time, and an echo too, of the love she must give up to be strong enough to rule. Richard Attenborough I loved in the scene when the power game comes full circle. Norfolk is all huff and yes a little dramatic but he's a great foil to Elizabeth herself and one somehow tends to see his point of view at times, which is a terrific thing. And not one of the supporting cast is wasted - every face is brilliantly lit, and intensely shot. And Cate Blanchett is a goddess and the film simply belongs to her.Initially two things rankled. One was the lack of English scenery - what did the people of England at the time do, how did they live, what was life like in England at that time? But Elizabeth is a psychological drama, it is about power and about the rarified atmosphere that monarchs, kings and even modern day rulers must live in. In that sense the director's choice to rarify the world of this movie makes complete sense, as does the quick pacing - something you'd expect more from a thriller than a historical.The other was the fact that Elizabeth seems to depend a lot on the help of Walsingham in her success. I debated this for a while thinking 'Doesn't it undermine her as a woman?' and came to the conclusion that it doesn't. My rationale was this If Elizabeth was a man, we would never have, in any way, seen her need for help as a sign of weakness, after all no seat of power (even in a small office with a hundred people I assure you) is won and retained without genuine support from the middle ranks. The only possible reason we could see Elizabeth as weak is perhaps because of our own conditioning making us believe that if a woman needs help, it must be 'because she is a woman'. Hell, everyone needs help, and I have a strong feeling anyway that by the time Elizabeth got good at being Queen, she needed absolutely no help from anyone. By then she was a great Queen and a brilliant pro, and not a conflicted soul (as the film admittedly 'hypothesises')&#133; in fact she was probably so good a queen, she was probably boring as a 'character'.

His son, Hamlet (Kenneth Branaugh) is then visited by the ghost of his father, who tells him that his uncle, Claudius (Derek Jacobi), killed him in order to 1, take the thrown, 2, take his wife, Gertrude (Julie Christie), and 3, make the already edgy Hamlet go completely nuts (or so it seems&#133;). Okay, that last one probably wasn't the intent, but it certainly turns out to be the result, and Hamlet pushes his love, the fair Ophilia (Kate Winslet), completely away from him. Her father Polonius and brother Laertes both oppose any continuance of the romance, which pushes him further over the edge, and the march of the Norwegian armies, led by Fortinbras (Rufus Sewell), on Denmark throws him completely overboard. Kenneth Branaugh's version of Shakespeare's classic is the complete play. Practically every line of dialogue is uttered (except perhaps one or two here and there), resulting in a 4 hour film. Unfortunately, the film is kind of on and off, with some scenes managing to be absolutely brilliant and others rather boring. The first hour is so lumpy it's pretty off-putting other than a moment here and there&#133; but then Moses comes in to save the day. More or less. At this point, Charlton Heston comes in to do the role of the Player King. And, for the approximately five minutes he's on stage, he gives speeches so powerfully and emotionally that you are practically forced into the movie, and from then on, you're in, and the occasional lags never quite o'ercrow your spirits. The cast is a little too big, with everyone down to the gratuitous extras being someone you've heard of (I mean, honestly, you cast Judi Dench and John Gielgud in a Shakespeare movie only to let them appear for 2 seconds without a line of dialogue in a pointless shot anyway?). However, most of them are quite good. Branaugh is a little stagy at times, but most of the time, he's superb. But the good supporting performances are what really pull you through the slow spots Jacobi, Christie, Billy Crystal (as the gravedigger), whoever played Horatio, and especially Winslet are excellent, although none of them top Heston. All this excellence easily makes up for the rest of the cast, which is a mixture of fine but no more, barely adequate (Jack Lemmon), expressive but one-dimensional (such as Sewell), completely wooden, and Robin Williams, who's great to watch usually but annoying and pointless here. (on a similar note, I was surprised Crystal did such a good job in his role, but he was more than up to the challenge; Williams might have been if he wasn't so recognizable and his beard wasn't so fake) In addition, the film works because the scenes that are brilliant --- such as Hamlet and Ophilia's stunningly performed dialogue after To Be or Not to Be, the beautifully made grave scenes, and the climax --- make up for the lulls just as well as the cast. It's also neat to see some of the characters like Claudius really becoming a full character, although Zeffrilli's version, despite being 90 minutes shorter, did a better job with Hamlet and especially Laertes. Another plus to this film is Patrick Doyle's score, which isn't great, but it does a fine job and has some superb passages (especially the aforementioned grave scenes). The cinematography (filmed in 70mm) is also quite good. Anyway, this film is definitely a mixed bag, but enough of it is excellent that the movie works, even if on the whole it's slightly inferior to the Zeffrilli\/Gibson version.

Her documentary, you see, gets distilled into a series of catch-phrases and disconnected, clichéd scenes set to a soundtrack of pop music, and abounding with product placements. Sadly, the butchered documentary is indistinguishable from the rest of the movie in this sense.Reality Bites attempts to be Diner, or The Big Chill for Gen X, but instead ends up being more of a St Elmo's Fire for the 90s. It rings false almost continuously. There is never an interaction between characters that doesn't seem contrived and forced. From moment to moment they move from one artificial scenario to another; dancing in the gas station, the episode of Good Times game, everything the characters do feels fake.This movie feels like it was written by someone who conducted interviews with gen Xers, watched how they live, and then wrote a story, based on the romantic comedy formula, that included all the touchstones and references they felt would appeal to Gen Xers.In short, Reality Bites was written and directed by people who just didn't get Gen X. Worse though, they also didn't get how to make a good movie.On the plus side, you can watch for appearances by Andy Dick, David Spade, Jeanne Tripplehorn and Renee Zellweger in tiny roles, and this may have been the career-defining moment for Janeane Garofolo....and I have to give the people behind Reality Bites credit for the line Because Mom, I'm not retarded.

Well Ethan Hawke's character is right, it is indeed when the actual meaning is the complete opposite of the literal meaning.In the colloquial sense of the word however, a good example of irony would be having characters bemoaning the ham-fisted attempts by the baby boomers to define and package generation X, in a movie that ham-fistedly attempts to define and package Gen-X.The makers of Reality Bites however are apparently immune to irony, even when it is attached to its own backside We are supposed to be (humourously) appalled right along with Rider's character when the documentary she has been constantly working on gets commercialised and dumbed down. Her documentary, you see, gets distilled into a series of catch-phrases and disconnected, clichéd scenes set to a soundtrack of pop music, and abounding with product placements.

The former Queen of Naboo, Padme Amidala, is now a Senator and returning to Coruscant for a crucial vote on the creation of an army for the Republic, now threatened by Separatist factions. Amidala is a leader of the opposition of the Military Creation Act. Upon reaching Coruscant an attempt is made on her life and off we go.Old friends Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker are assigned to protect the senator. Ewan McGregor returns as Obi-Wan and gives another fine performance. Hayden Christensen takes over the role of the adolescent Skywalker, who is now being trained as a Jedi by Obi-Wan. Anakin is excited to see Padme after all these years and his childhood crush has blossomed into full-blown love. Here Christensen's performance suffers as he and Padme, played once again by Natalie Portman, embark on one of the most awkward romances I've ever seen.After another attempt on Padme's life and a frenetic chase through the skies of Coruscant Obi-Wan and Anakin corral the bounty hunter responsible. But before she can reveal who she was hired by she is killed by a toxic dart. And this will send Obi-Wan and Anakin off in different directions.Obi-Wan finds the dart came from a planet called Kamino, a planet of cloners located in a system which does not appear in the Jedi archives. With some help from Yoda and some young Jedi in training Obi-Wan is able to ascertain the location of his missing planet. It seems information about Kamino had been deleted from the archives. Only a Jedi could have done this. Who and why? These are answers which will prove critical.Obi-Wan makes his way to rain-soaked Kamino where he is told that years ago a since-slain Jedi placed an order for a clone army. The template for the clones was bounty hunter Jango Fett who Obi-Wan meets on Kamino. We also meet Jango's son Boba, a key figure of the original trilogy who it is quite interesting to see the origins of here. Obi-Wan comes to believe Jango was responsible for the attacks on Senator Amidala. The Jedi Council, disturbed they could not see creation of the unauthorized clone army orders Obi-Wan to bring Jango to Coruscant. Easier said than done as Obi-Wan must track Jango and his son Boba to the planet Geonosis.Meanwhile in the interests of safety Anakin has escorted Padme back to her home planet of Naboo. Here he makes his feelings for her quite clear. She resists as they would have to live a lie which would destroy them both. She clearly has feelings for him but attachment is forbidden for a Jedi. To carry on this romance could lead to Anakin's expulsion from the Jedi order. The dialogue here as the two grow closer is stilted, wooden and forced. People just don't talk like that and it detracts from the film. It is hard to blame the actors who can only read the lines they are given.We soon see that Anakin is burdened by terrible nightmares about his mother who he feels is suffering on Tatooine. Here we first see great pain and fear in young Skywalker. And as Yoda taught us in Episode I fear is a path to the Dark Side. Anakin and Padme race to Tatooine to rescue his mother, now the wife of moisture farmer Cliegg Lars who lives in a familiar homestead in the desert. Here we first meet a young Owen Lars and his girlfriend Beru who will later have a much larger role to play. It turns out Anakin's mother has been kidnapped and is feared dead. Anakin goes off to attempt to rescue her and when he sees how she has suffered we see the first glimpses of anger and rage in the young man who would be Darth Vader.Leaving Tatooine, Anakin, Padme and loyal droids R2-D2 and C-3PO (happy to again see Anakin, his maker) take off for Geonosis to rescue Obi-Wan who has fallen into the clutches of Count Dooku, a former Jedi who left the order and is now leader of the Separatist movement. Dooku has a massive droid army at his disposal and it seems the Jedi will be needing that clone army after all. Anakin and Padme are soon captured and along with Obi-Wan sentenced to die. With death imminent Padme drops the facade and tells Anakin she loves him. Their lives are about to be destroyed anyway so he should know.Of course we know the execution won't quite go as planned. Much of the drama here is drained by the fact we know quite well certain characters must survive or else there can't be an Episode IV and, well, we've already seen Episode IV. However what follows is visually impressive as a great number of Jedi, reinforced by their clone army, arrive on Geonosis. For the first time in the saga we see many Jedi in action as the droid and clone armies face off. The lengthy but well-done battle sequence is the beginning of the Clone Wars.After a final surprising and ultimately thrilling lightsaber battle we begin to tie up the loose ends and get ready for Episode III. Episode II turns out to be satisfying although it certainly has its flaws, most notably the cringe-inducing attempts at romance coming from the mouth of young Anakin. But the positives far outweigh the negatives. Jar Jar Binks is mercifully reduced to a minor role. Samuel L. Jackson is given much more to do this time around as Mace Windu. Ian McDiarmid is reliably terrific in his performance as Chancellor Palpatine. The visuals are stunning, the battle sequences thrilling, all backed by another terrific score by John Williams. It's not perfect but Attack of the Clones does its job in making you anxious for Episode III, the final piece in the puzzle.

Sure, on the surface it is brilliant slapstick with scenes so hysterically funny they make you roll off your chair. If ever there was a laugh-aloud movie this is it, and it ranks right up there with classics like Blazing Saddles, Return of the Pink Panther and Monty Python's Holy Grail. Even if it didn't go any deeper than this, Steve Martin and John Candy perform a comic feat that wouldn't put Laurel and Hardy to shame.But the strength of the movie is that just below this surface it plays out a very human drama. The two main characters, Neal Page (Steve Martin) and Dale Griffith (John Candy) are polar opposites. Neal is introvert, anal retentive, arrogant and ambitious, a typical stressed-out corporate middle-manager who works in New York away from his family in Chicago. Dale is a simple salesman, obese, extravert, uninhibited, a social animal with friends in every town. They find themselves bound together by fate on a journey from New York to Chicago two days before Thanksgiving where everything that can possibly go wrong does go wrong.As you would expect, the involuntary close relation of such disparate characters initially causes massive friction. Neal can't stand Dale's physical presence nor his endless pointless chatter, Dale is not impressed by Neal's arrogant stiffness and his not-so-subtle attempts to get rid of him. Yet, they need each other to reach their objective and they know it. Some brilliant scenes play out this confrontation, but in the end they come to grudingly accept each other, and through their trials and tribulations on the road acceptance even grows into something resembling a budding respect. Steve Martin and John Candy are fantastic, their chemistry fuels the movie and raises it to a level well above standard comedy.*************** Spoilers ahead *********************** But the film goes deeper yet. At the next level, there is underlying tragedy that both characters try to hide in their day to day existence. It turns out that Dale has lost his wife eight years before, and has in fact been wandering and travelling throughout the country without ever going back home. He is effectively homeless and lives in cheap hotels and motels out of a trunk (which by the way also acts as a very effective comic prop), but he never discloses this to Neal. His life contains a great emotional emptiness but he can't really face up to it and he pretends to be a happily married man. Neal, on the other hand, is so self-obsessed with his career that he sacrifices the love for his family to the point where his wife becomes mistrusting of what is going on. Here is a man who risks losing what really matters for the sake of shallow success. He vaguely understands that something is going wrong but can't get himself to admit it or even pause and think about it.It is only when the two of them get paired up that they come to realise what is wrong with themselves. Dale is confronted with Neal's family life, a life that he himself so sorely misses, and Neal realises in the end that life is about more than himself and that other people do matter. At the conclusion of the film they come together and fulfill each other's needs, becoming whole in the process.This is buddy movie\/ road flick supreme. The tragedy underlying the superficial slapstick makes this film Humour with a Capital H, much more so than the great comedies I mentioned before. You will have to go back to the likes of Charles Chaplin and Buster Keaton to find anything comparable.However, and this is where the true greatness lies, in the final analysis this film is not about the drama of two different characters at all, but about the opposing forces struggling within each of us ourselves. We all have a Neal and a Dale side, apparent opposites that cannot exist together, but only by accepting this and giving both sides equal weight can we become whole human beings. The film shows that this may at first appear an impossible task, frought with risk and danger, but if we persevere it can be done, and the prize of healing ourselves is worth it.Hilarious comedy, superb drama and ground truth - few movies would even dare to try and combine these themes. Planes, trains and automobiles does, and it succeeds brilliantly. Martin and Candy deliver stellar performances that work at all of these levels. Definitely one of the best movies ever, and vastly underrated.

Sure, on the surface it is brilliant slapstick with scenes so hysterically funny they make you roll off your chair. If ever there was a laugh-aloud movie this is it, and it ranks right up there with classics like Blazing Saddles, Return of the Pink Panther and Monty Python's Holy Grail. Even if it didn't go any deeper than this, Steve Martin and John Candy perform a comic feat that wouldn't put Laurel and Hardy to shame.But the strength of the movie is that just below this surface it plays out a very human drama. The two main characters, Neal Page (Steve Martin) and Dale Griffith (John Candy) are polar opposites. Neal is introvert, anal retentive, arrogant and ambitious, a typical stressed-out corporate middle-manager who works in New York away from his family in Chicago. Dale is a simple salesman, obese, extravert, uninhibited, a social animal with friends in every town. They find themselves bound together by fate on a journey from New York to Chicago two days before Thanksgiving where everything that can possibly go wrong does go wrong.As you would expect, the involuntary close relation of such disparate characters initially causes massive friction. Neal can't stand Dale's physical presence nor his endless pointless chatter, Dale is not impressed by Neal's arrogant stiffness and his not-so-subtle attempts to get rid of him. Yet, they need each other to reach their objective and they know it. Some brilliant scenes play out this confrontation, but in the end they come to grudingly accept each other, and through their trials and tribulations on the road acceptance even grows into something resembling a budding respect. Steve Martin and John Candy are fantastic, their chemistry fuels the movie and raises it to a level well above standard comedy.*************** Spoilers ahead *********************** But the film goes deeper yet. At the next level, there is underlying tragedy that both characters try to hide in their day to day existence. It turns out that Dale has lost his wife eight years before, and has in fact been wandering and travelling throughout the country without ever going back home. He is effectively homeless and lives in cheap hotels and motels out of a trunk (which by the way also acts as a very effective comic prop), but he never discloses this to Neal. His life contains a great emotional emptiness but he can't really face up to it and he pretends to be a happily married man. Neal, on the other hand, is so self-obsessed with his career that he sacrifices the love for his family to the point where his wife becomes mistrusting of what is going on. Here is a man who risks losing what really matters for the sake of shallow success. He vaguely understands that something is going wrong but can't get himself to admit it or even pause and think about it.It is only when the two of them get paired up that they come to realise what is wrong with themselves. Dale is confronted with Neal's family life, a life that he himself so sorely misses, and Neal realises in the end that life is about more than himself and that other people do matter. At the conclusion of the film they come together and fulfill each other's needs, becoming whole in the process.This is buddy movie\/ road flick supreme. The tragedy underlying the superficial slapstick makes this film Humour with a Capital H, much more so than the great comedies I mentioned before. You will have to go back to the likes of Charles Chaplin and Buster Keaton to find anything comparable.However, and this is where the true greatness lies, in the final analysis this film is not about the drama of two different characters at all, but about the opposing forces struggling within each of us ourselves.

And then something happens that sends him off on an unreal, surrealistic adventure that teaches him a thing or two about life. And death.On the one hand this film is about some pretty big subjects the meaning of life, taking chances, love, passion, fun, adventure, and all those things we of the great middle class only dream of, or occasionally enjoy, on paid for, organised trips 'around the world'.But on the other hand it is about nothing at all. The narrative itself is an adventure, about taking off into the unknown (even if the reason is not entirely one's own choice). However, the story choices are at some level all very arbitrary and the plot if you examine it is very linear and minimal. The point is that the film's content\/events are so absurd, random and arbitrary, that the film seems to be revelling in the arbitrariness of nature itself.

Maybe it's that I don't quite get this film. But Cabaret only very rarely worked for me. In a nutshell (I'll flesh all of this out more below), I'm not sure I got the point of setting the film in Berlin during the transition from Weimar to Nazi Germany. I didn't really like the music or the cabaret performances. Very little of the soap opera stuff had any impact on me. I strongly disliked Liza Minnelli and only occasionally liked Michael York. And the direction, cinematography, and most of the technical elements did very little for me. There were a couple things I did enjoy (one not so minor), but you'll have to read on to discover what they were (I need to create _some_ suspense here).Cabaret is the story of Sally Bowles (Minnelli) and Brian Roberts (York). Bowles is living in Berlin in 1931, singing and dancing in a cabaret called the Kit Kat Klub. During the opening, we see Roberts just arriving in town. He ends up at the boarding house where Bowles is living, hoping to acquire a room. He's taking a working vacation from graduate school in England. He plans on earning his room and board by teaching English to Germans.Roberts and Bowles' relationship evolves over the course of the film--that's the gist of the plot. Roberts also makes two friends among his students, Fritz Wendel (Fritz Wepper) and the very rich Natalia Landauer (Marisa Berenson), and Bowles meets the even richer Maximilian von Heune (Helmut Griem) at the dry cleaners. All of this is interspersed with occasional cabaret performances (only very seldomly featuring Minnelli) and even less occasional references to the rise of the Nazi party. The bulk of the film is soap-operatic relationships among the characters.Cabaret had a somewhat circuitous trip to the silver screen, starting with the semi-autobiographical fiction of Christopher Isherwood, who lived in Berlin between 1929 and 1933. After Isherwood, the material was transformed into a play and then a film both entitled I Am a Camera (1955). Finally, it became the Broadway show, and after that, this film version, for which director and famed choreographer Bob Fosse wanted to look back to Isherwood's writing. I haven't read Isherwood's work yet, but from what I understand, it has more of an essay-like tonality, and attempts to capture life in the relatively decadent Berlin of the 1930s in detail.Unfortunately, the end result is that this film version of Cabaret plays like a directionless pastiche of mostly mundane events. The goal seems to be an in-depth portrait of a troubled woman in a troubled-environment, and conjointly maybe a commentary on contributing factors that led to the imbalanced state of both. But what Fosse achieved instead was a random-feeling, poorly acted hodgepodge of soap-operatic nonsense.Minnelli's performance is so loaded with annoying affectations, and she so frequently overacts--not to mention that she's very disturbing to look at--that it kills what little dramatic impact the pithier developments should have. York vacillates between confusion, woodenness and overacting, occasionally finding a balanced middle ground that's enjoyable, but it's like waiting for a slow-moving pendulum to reach its nadir.The Nazi material, including the two all-too-brief instances of society embracing some of the attitudes or ideas, could have been very strong and poignant--especially in contrast to the freewheeling life depicted elsewhere. But Fosse makes no kind of commitment to it, so it ends up feeling like it was added on as an afterthought, like scotch-taping a paper lapel to an otherwise complete cashmere coat.Fritz and Natalia, the two characters that I did enjoy and who had a compelling story that was intimately bound up with rising Nazism, were largely ignored. Fosse spends maybe 10 minutes on them.The music and choreography for the cabaret performances lies somewhere between banal and unpleasantly corny.

But Cabaret only very rarely worked for me. In a nutshell (I'll flesh all of this out more below), I'm not sure I got the point of setting the film in Berlin during the transition from Weimar to Nazi Germany. I didn't really like the music or the cabaret performances. Very little of the soap opera stuff had any impact on me. I strongly disliked Liza Minnelli and only occasionally liked Michael York. And the direction, cinematography, and most of the technical elements did very little for me. There were a couple things I did enjoy (one not so minor), but you'll have to read on to discover what they were (I need to create _some_ suspense here).Cabaret is the story of Sally Bowles (Minnelli) and Brian Roberts (York). Bowles is living in Berlin in 1931, singing and dancing in a cabaret called the Kit Kat Klub. During the opening, we see Roberts just arriving in town. He ends up at the boarding house where Bowles is living, hoping to acquire a room. He's taking a working vacation from graduate school in England. He plans on earning his room and board by teaching English to Germans.Roberts and Bowles' relationship evolves over the course of the film--that's the gist of the plot. Roberts also makes two friends among his students, Fritz Wendel (Fritz Wepper) and the very rich Natalia Landauer (Marisa Berenson), and Bowles meets the even richer Maximilian von Heune (Helmut Griem) at the dry cleaners. All of this is interspersed with occasional cabaret performances (only very seldomly featuring Minnelli) and even less occasional references to the rise of the Nazi party. The bulk of the film is soap-operatic relationships among the characters.Cabaret had a somewhat circuitous trip to the silver screen, starting with the semi-autobiographical fiction of Christopher Isherwood, who lived in Berlin between 1929 and 1933. After Isherwood, the material was transformed into a play and then a film both entitled I Am a Camera (1955). Finally, it became the Broadway show, and after that, this film version, for which director and famed choreographer Bob Fosse wanted to look back to Isherwood's writing. I haven't read Isherwood's work yet, but from what I understand, it has more of an essay-like tonality, and attempts to capture life in the relatively decadent Berlin of the 1930s in detail.Unfortunately, the end result is that this film version of Cabaret plays like a directionless pastiche of mostly mundane events. The goal seems to be an in-depth portrait of a troubled woman in a troubled-environment, and conjointly maybe a commentary on contributing factors that led to the imbalanced state of both. But what Fosse achieved instead was a random-feeling, poorly acted hodgepodge of soap-operatic nonsense.Minnelli's performance is so loaded with annoying affectations, and she so frequently overacts--not to mention that she's very disturbing to look at--that it kills what little dramatic impact the pithier developments should have. York vacillates between confusion, woodenness and overacting, occasionally finding a balanced middle ground that's enjoyable, but it's like waiting for a slow-moving pendulum to reach its nadir.The Nazi material, including the two all-too-brief instances of society embracing some of the attitudes or ideas, could have been very strong and poignant--especially in contrast to the freewheeling life depicted elsewhere. But Fosse makes no kind of commitment to it, so it ends up feeling like it was added on as an afterthought, like scotch-taping a paper lapel to an otherwise complete cashmere coat.Fritz and Natalia, the two characters that I did enjoy and who had a compelling story that was intimately bound up with rising Nazism, were largely ignored. Fosse spends maybe 10 minutes on them.The music and choreography for the cabaret performances lies somewhere between banal and unpleasantly corny.

The lack of plot was a poor choice by the director and writer. It made the movie less enjoyable and much less believable. Without a conflict, there is nothing to keep you hooked on the movie and want to finish watching it, except the hope that it can only get better (which it never does). When there was a conflict, it was solved within the next couple minutes in a very non-satisfactory way. For example I'm pregnant What should we do about it I'm getting an abortion. you pay for half and give me a ride ok. And thats all that happened with that. It was ridiculous. The lack of character development was also terrible. Not once did I ever feel attached to one of the characters. There were so many little sub plots that there was no attention drawn to one character or set of characters. You did not ever really get to know any one of the characters.The movie felt like it was trying to copy National Lampoon's Animal House, but it did a horrible job of it.

I had heard great things and was expecting to see an amazing movie, how wrong I was. The movie had no plot, no conflict and no character development. Some people have said that even though there was not plot, it was still a good movie as it encompassed life in the 80's perfectly. I disagree. The lack of plot was a poor choice by the director and writer. It made the movie less enjoyable and much less believable. Without a conflict, there is nothing to keep you hooked on the movie and want to finish watching it, except the hope that it can only get better (which it never does). When there was a conflict, it was solved within the next couple minutes in a very non-satisfactory way. For example I'm pregnant What should we do about it I'm getting an abortion. you pay for half and give me a ride ok. And thats all that happened with that. It was ridiculous. The lack of character development was also terrible. Not once did I ever feel attached to one of the characters. There were so many little sub plots that there was no attention drawn to one character or set of characters. You did not ever really get to know any one of the characters.The movie felt like it was trying to copy National Lampoon's Animal House, but it did a horrible job of it. Sean Penn's character Jeff Spicoli seemed to be an attempt at John Belushi's famous Bluto. However, it didn't work. I cannot even begin to explain to you how bad this movie was in any sensical way. All in all, it is a movie that you probably should see in your life as it is, for some reason, a classic. HOwever, do not expect much (if anything) from the movie or you will be highly disappointed as i was. The only reason i rated it 4\/10 is because there is an old Volkswagon Van (better known as the Hippie Van) and I want one. Without the Hippie Van, the movie gets a 2.

D himself is a halfling half man half vampire he can live in the daylight, but not for too long or else he will break down completely. His bloodlust is also better controlled than that of 100% vampires. His character is brought to life very well in the movie, as well as the characters of a competing vampire-hunter gang.The main element of the story is about love between the abducting vampire and the girl Charlotte. Charlotte says she loves him, which contradicts the abduction-part of the story. They want to get out (both) to the Night City, where it is always dark. This is where it gets to the second part of the story a castle owned by Barbarois, a vicious vampire that uses deception as a powerful weapon. In that castle some sort of spaceship is located with which they are able to leave in the end, leaving D and Leia (one of the competing group's members) behind.As far as flow, storytelling and animation go, it's OK, up to good in some scenes. But still something is lacking with this potential theme. Not the best in the world, but definitely not the worst.As a comparison, the motion picture Blade which contains the same half vampire half human theme, is much more about action and violence in Vampire Hunter D, there is a lot more story(telling) and background, as well as a lot of symbolism.Worth a look if you like anime, vampire-storytelling and a bit of violence. What the movie misses in actual story-quality, it makes up in visuals and animation. 7 out of 10 from me.

Evil Queen Taramis (Sarah Douglas, Ursa of the Superman films) offers to resurrect Valeria in return that Conan accompany virgin princess Jehnna (Olivai D'Abo) on a mission to acquire the this key artifact thing that will resurrect an evil god of some sort. Along for the ride is Mako's wizard, the late Wilt Chamberlain's bodyguard Bombatta, evil eye Grace Jones as killer Amazon Zula, and Tracy Walter as bumbling sidekick Malak.More of a comedy or spoof of the genre, lacking much of the drama that elevated the first film above being just another costume epic. Arnold is fun to watch - though he should have kept his shirt and pants on -as you can see him developing his Arnold persona with more of the charm and humor that characterized his outings in films like Commando, Predator and The Running Man; he even shows more knack for drama as he delivers lines such as What I want, you cannot give me. and Life for Valeria. Wilt Chamberlain plays his part well enough, Jones is fierce looking, Mako is dignified, Oliva D'Abo is cute and Walter has his moments though he really doesn't belong in this movie (Robert E. Howard's Conan would never have taken such a cowardly fool under his wing, and you can see Conan himself shake his head at Malak). Action pieces are executed competently, but there's something sad about watching Arnold get his ass handed to him by the gator ape (the late Pat Roach, may he rest in peace). Conan's climactic brawl with the monster god is the crown jewel moment of the film.
