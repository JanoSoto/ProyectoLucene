The leading man, Matthew was OK and at least convincing for the most part in his role.Fran's parents were annoying and I think the singing thing was a bit unnecessary.

They come across a swimming pool & decide to have a midnight dip, unfortunately for them the pool is full of experimental genetically altered ultra aggressive piranha fish that eat both of them, hey they didn't put those 'no trespassing' signs up for fun did they? Maggie McKeown (Heather Menzies) works for a company that traces missing people & is hired by Earl Lyon (Richard Deacon) to find the two now obviously missing backpackers. Maggie heads for Indian Springs & comes across a cabin owned by Paul Grogan (Bradford Dillman) whom says he has not seen them & that there isn't anything around here except the old Army test site, Maggie makes Paul show her where it is. Once there they discover the pool & a necklace belonging to Barbara & fear they both might have drowned. They decide to drain the pool & see what they can see. However draining the pool turns out to be a big mistake as it lets the mutant killer piranha out into a nearby river. The scientist responsible for the piranha Dr. Robert Hoak (Kevin McCarthy) warns of the danger but at first neither Maggie or Paul believe him, that is until they discover Paul's friend Jack (Keenan Wynn) lying by the side of the river dead with both feet eaten to the bone. Maggie & Paul quickly surmise that the piranha are headed down river towards a summer camp for children & a soon to be opened holiday resort called 'Aquarena'. Maggie & Paul face a race against time to warn of the impending danger especially when the Army turn up & both the corrupt Colonel Waxman (Bruce Gordon) & evil scientist Dr. Mengers (Barbara Steele) appear to want to cover the situation up & seem reluctant to acknowledge the risk the piranha pose to the general population...Co-edited & directed by Joe Dante who also has a small uncredited cameo in it as a scuba diver & executive produced by the infamous penny pinching Roger Corman I understand that Piranha is held in high regard amongst many, personally I can't see why. Piranha is not a bad film, far from it in fact but the script by John Sayles who also has a small uncredited cameo as an Army sentry obviously takes every decent idea from Jaws (1975) & uses piranha instead of a shark. Despite what you may have heard & what the IMDb says Piranha has no comedy elements in it that I could detect, there are no slapstick visual gags & no attempt at laugh out loud jokes. It does however feel quite jokey in a relaxed light hearted way as it never takes itself too seriously & has a few dry mildly amusing one-liners. I don't care what anyone says you cannot hold your breath for that long underwater, anyone who has seen the stupid ending will know what I'm talking about. I also thought Pirahna was a little on the slow side & had no variety at all, it really is very linear & I found it became a bit repetitive towards the end. The characters are likable, the interplay between Dillman's dry alcoholic bitter divorc√©e & Menzie's chirpy witty attractive blonde is entertaining & quite fun as the film develops. You never see any piranha's just quick cuts & they still look terrible, the blood & gore levels were extremely disappointing. Most of the attacks are depicted by simply showing victims splashing & screaming in red water & for a bit of variety sometimes we are lucky enough to get red bubbling water, oh joy. Director Dante fails to create much tension or excitement with the attacks which all end up looking identical. There is a brief shot of someone with their feet eaten to the bone, a bitten chewed up face, a bloody back & various blink & you'll miss them bite shots. Very disappointing & I personally think Jaws is the much gorier & violent film with more blood & body parts. There is also a bizarre unconvincing stop-motion fish creature which has nothing to do with anything & is seen a few times then completely forgotten about. The acting is good throughout, nothing spectacular but not bad. Piranha looks OK & is well made considering the supposed $660,000 budget which really doesn't sound like a lot even back in '78. I liked Piranha, I don't think it deserves some of the rave reviews it gets & is in no way comparable to Jaws as the two films are simply not on the same planet in terms of quality. A perfectly acceptable & enjoyable way to pass 90 odd minutes but don't expect anything brilliant or life changing. Definitely worth a watch especially if it turns up on TV & you can catch it for free, like I did in fact!

After a car accident, she can't remember who she is. She stays with the sweet and naive Betty and names herself Rita. Betty, played by the gorgeous Naomi Watts, is an actress who has just moved to Hollywood for a big break. She tries to help Rita find out who she really is. Along the way we meet a ruthless producer, and witness many various strange nonsense like situations. All feel like a disjointed dream. Who can forget that creepy bum behind the restaurant dumpster holding a sort of Pandora's's box? Then the film becomes very confusing towards the end with a flashback and out of sequence style. I won't ruin the surprise, but I'll give you a couple of hints for the latter parts of the film. (WARNING, STOP READING IF YOU HAVENT SEEN THE FILM YET!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!)

These 4 things are very important for you the viewer or detective trying to unlock the mystery. (OK IT'S SAFE TO READ NOW FOR NEW VIEWERS!) David Lynch has not only created a flawless surreal masterpiece of mystery. In a Kenneth Anger like fashion, Lynch also creates a satire that makes fun of Hollywood.
