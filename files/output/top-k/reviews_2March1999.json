It uses one of   the most complex narrative structures yet produced by cinema to tell   three stories (yes, it DOES have a plot) 1) the one the book wanted to   tell (the book's title comes from a 19th century allusion to the   British Empire's infantry red uniforms whose small numbers managed to   'protect' the British civilization from their point of view from   the countless hordes of savages which the Empire ruled (this concept   is regrettably racist). James Jones used this analogy to tell the story   of how young American soldiers with no battlefield experience become   bloodied veterans. 2) the fundamental paradox of war to protect   civilization (all that we hold dear) we are prepared to send young   men to fight in wars. We know that in war they will see and do things   that will turn them into the very savages that we are trying to   prevent from destroying our civilization. If you believe that there are   things even worse in the world than war (genocide, rule by the Axis   powers) then war is not irrational, but the paradox mentioned above   exists. 3) man is not distinct from nature but a part of it. Therefore,   nature is both beautiful and cruel. (Like our civilization and war).    To tell these stories Terence Malick used symbolic imagery, flashback,   voice-overs, passages without dialogue, long close-ups of the actors'   faces, changes in tempo and a haunting score.    For example, his use of symbolism has been much criticized but   everything has a purpose e.g. the crocodile entering the green algae   covered water (nature's savagery), the native man who passes the   company, after they land on the beach, walking in the opposite   direction apparently oblivious of their presence (their shocked and   bewildered faces reveal how they are forced to question the relevance   of the reasons for which they may shortly die - the defense of   civilization), the tree being choked by parasitic vines ('nature is   cruel' as Lt. Col. Tall so aptly puts it), the bird being born as a   soldier dies (it was not dying as many people thought - we come from   the earth and return to it as we hear in the voice-overs), dogs eating   a human corpse (dog eat dog - the soldiers are becoming desensitized   to the violence) the same crocodile, now dead, at the end of the film   being carried away as a sort of trophy (danger has receded for the   moment), the coconut sprouting a palm on the empty beach in the last   scene (after death comes birth - the cycle of life). There are, of   course, many, many other examples.    The use of flashback accompanied by voice-over to convey feelings as   opposed to narrate a story must have appeared strange to anyone who   never saw Alain Resnais' Hiroshima Mon Amour. It was used most   effectively with Ben Chaplin's character (Pvt. Jack Bell) when he   thinks of his wife back home - incidentally he idolizes her in the same   way we do our own culture - another metaphor. His disillusionment is   profound and shows that what he was prepared to die for was only as   pure as any ideal.    It is often say that there was no character development. This is also   false. For example, in the scene where Sgt. Welsh is speaking to Witt   shortly after his arrest for being AWOL , Welsh seems to claim that it   is every man for himself when he says that individual sacrifice is   worthless, there is no world but this one and that each man must get   through the war the best that he can. However, we subsequently see him   risking his life to deliver morphine to a MORTALLY wounded man during   the frontal assault on the Japanese machine gun nests. Also, Witt can   not understand where evil comes from in the midst of the beauty he sees   in the Melanesian village, but when he returns there he sees man   arguing, enemy skulls, crabs hideously crawling around on an   outstretched human hand and a child's back covered with insect bites   while those people around it are seemingly uncaring. These images   suggest that evil is inherent in man.    Malick avoids the usual stereotypes. Although we see heroic acts (such   as the taking of the machine gun nests by Capt. John Gaff's John   Cusack team of volunteers), there are no recognizable heros. It is   true that the characters are not sharply defined. When the violence   comes it is against all of them i.e. all of US.    Are there then any relevant negative criticisms of the movie? I would   say that it did not meander as some critics alleged (every scene has a   purpose) but it was unnecessarily long. There is a certain irony in   this. It is said that Malick edited over 100 hours of material first to   9 hours. Understandably the studio did not accept this. He then reduced   it to 6 hours and then to 3. (This helps to explain the lightning   appearances by John Travolta and George Clooney, I see no problem,   however, with using big name stars in such short roles - Richard   Attenborough did it in A Bridge Too Far). With so much cherished   material available, I suspect that Malick fell into the trap of opting   for the maximum length that the studio would allow when more   artistically efficient editing would have reduced the film to 2* hours.   The balance between the action and meditative passages would have   worked better if certain scenes had been cut, such as Witt's passing a   wounded soldier on the way back to his company after leaving the   Melanesian village the second time and also the conversation that Witt   and Welsh have towards the end of the film (Welsh appears a stranger to   him, suggesting that he is simply a troublemaker). Even with the   exclusion of these scenes Witt would still appear a humanist and Welsh   a complex every man.    Most people would agree that the film is visually stunning. As there   has been very little even remotely similar in the past, it will be   confusing for many people but I am convinced that this will come to be   seen as a hugely important work - the most influential of the 1990s.
