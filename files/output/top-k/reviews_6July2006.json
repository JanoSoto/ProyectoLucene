Using Will Smith's stardom, which he got from Independence Day the year before, and adding another interesting character played by Tommy Lee Jones, we end up with a hilarious spoof on all sci-fi films.The Men In Black are a secret government agency that watches over extra terrestrial activity. Both agent J (Smith) and agent K (Jones) are like a dynamic duo who must work together to stop a monstrous bug from stealing something called a Galaxy. They are given one hour, an intergalactic week, to return it to the Arquillian's or earth will face destruction.This movie had me cracking up. Will Smith was hysterical as the obnoxious J and Tommy Lee Jones was even better as K. His deadpan style of acting was just perfect for this movie, and both him and Smith have great chemistry as partners in fighting alien crime. Linda Fiorentino and Rip Torn were also very good.Men In Black does not have the greatest special effects, but the characters are so fun to watch, that you don't even care how cheesy the special effects are. In fact the characters alone put this far above many of the other trashy films of the same genre.The story was also very creative in coming up with an idea to explain why there are some unusual people in the world. I know it's only fiction, but it made me wonder still. In fact if it was true, it sure would explain a lot.This movie offers spoof after spoof, and it does so in such a deadpan style that you can't help but break out in laughter upon viewing it. I mean all of this in a good way. It never takes itself seriously, and neither do the characters. Everybody involved seemed to enjoy making this movie. Thumbs up.

So it may not seem unreasonable to conclude that this movie's incredible popularity stems from preteens and teenagers who think that the f word is cool and hip. Doesn't paint moviegoers in the best light does it? While I liked Reservoir dogs and Kill Bill 1 and 2, I simply cannot understand how this movie was voted into the top 10 or maintains such a huge fanbase? Dogs and Kill Bill were both groundbreaking and Tarantino flicks themselves may be a kind of acquired taste but there is enough offensive material in this movie, totally wanton, to put anyone off. Overall it is nothing special and outstanding.Now since some of his other movies were really good, Tarantino must have obviously done something right in Pulp fiction. So what could have possibly been that makes this movie so popular? Realism - Like all his other movies, this movie is very realistic. But there aren't enough outstanding scenes where realism adds an extra touch. There are only scenes of violence, extreme and explicit drug abuse, sodomy and boring conversation. The open use of racism can be considered realism but it is simply so easy to implement if one wants to.Dialog - Mostly long and highly trivial. French McDonalds, killing people, coffee...wtf? You can only make something great out of it only if you overanalyse the dialog and then put your self in a delusion of being a great analyst or philosopher. Too many f words, n words and racist lines. This is not cool, kids. Its garbage. Or I guess that a lot of people converse on trivial lines and it is uplifting for them to see the same type of boring talk in a big movie? Acting - Pretty good but once again, there are too often uttering long and trivial dialog. None of the characters are likable or even dispiseable to the extent that they have such depth. They were all pretty shallow.Plot - Mostly nonexistent. You could probably extract a story of redemption from it but too many people put all sorts of philosophical angles which were simply not intended. A bunch of different chapters intersect at one point. Harvey Kietel's character is pointless and is just thrown in as a deus ex machina. Tarantino's character and dialog are also pointless.Actions scenes, special effects, twists and all that - None. Most scenes are well done but they simply boring. A simple scene well done but nothing special happening in it.One teenager probably goes and tells another teenager how cool this movie is for nothing other than its explicit use of offensive elements (drugs, violence, sodomy, bad language) and he tells his friend and so on, the chain reaction makes less than mature minds fall for this movie. When someone speaks out against how bad this movie really is, they are labelled as idiots so are afraid to speak their mind. I'm glad that 225 reviews here were at least accurate. Screw the peer pressure and speak your mind, kids.Sorry, this anti-movie just leaves more of a negative impression than any positive. It also drags too much.

When I first heard the title of the movie, I was all like, oh, Jesus Christ, now they're gonna show some dull medieval-themed film with knights and wars.It was in 2005, when Danish TV2 decided to air the movie, and at that time I was absolutely fed up with anything medieval, because there simply was too much. But the name Dragonheart - particularly the part Dragon- made me turn on the TV set that evening and watch. Not that I expected much!It didn't turn out to be what I expected it to. Not at all. I expected it to be dull and stereotypical. Admitted, it was a knight movie, but what a movie it was! It was incredibly well made and the concept was impossible to dislike; the friendship between a man and a dragon. It's a beautiful concept. But it was not only that concept, that made me like the movie so much - it was also the humour of it, as well as the variety of events! Dragonheart made me laugh quite much - (Sean Connery as a dragon? Why not, LOL) - and just think about Bowen's air ride - and their little business venture. Not that I like the idea of dragon extermination, even pretended, but their methods to earn their money were hilarious. I cannot forget Draco saying, that the water is too shallow for him to sink, when he was supposed to look slain by Bowen..!!But not everything is to be laughed at. I won't go into further details, but there were places - especially in the end - where one could not help but being stern and sad. I needn't say more....and, technically speaking, the things in movie was also made very good. Everybody and everything looked as if it could have existed for real!I bet I sound very confusing, but it's not because of the movie. The movie is fantastic - much unlike my way of describing it!!

When I first heard the title of the movie, I was all like, oh, Jesus Christ, now they're gonna show some dull medieval-themed film with knights and wars.It was in 2005, when Danish TV2 decided to air the movie, and at that time I was absolutely fed up with anything medieval, because there simply was too much. But the name Dragonheart - particularly the part Dragon- made me turn on the TV set that evening and watch. Not that I expected much!It didn't turn out to be what I expected it to. Not at all. I expected it to be dull and stereotypical. Admitted, it was a knight movie, but what a movie it was! It was incredibly well made and the concept was impossible to dislike; the friendship between a man and a dragon. It's a beautiful concept. But it was not only that concept, that made me like the movie so much - it was also the humour of it, as well as the variety of events! Dragonheart made me laugh quite much - (Sean Connery as a dragon? Why not, LOL) - and just think about Bowen's air ride - and their little business venture. Not that I like the idea of dragon extermination, even pretended, but their methods to earn their money were hilarious.

Most of his films are disappointing; and, of course, he was also the man responsible for the entirely pointless Psycho remake - but Drugstore Cowboy is a major highlight of his filmography, and a film that I wouldn't hesitate to name as the best that he's directed. Drugstore Cowboy takes place in the seventies, and is a story of a self confessed 'dope-fiend'. Bob is a man wrapped up in superstitions, and a man that cares for little outside of where his next fix is going to come from. Along with a small group of like-minded friends, Bob robs pharmacies. However, his life changes when he believes that he's been hexed. The plot sticks closely to its subject material; and the director and cast do well in aptly portraying the mind of a drug user, whether it be through pseudo-dream sequences or the actions of the central protagonists. Following a man that robs drugstores isn't the most obvious base for a film; but it provides a good point of view for a story like this, and this film is almost completely successful throughout.Gus Van Sant appears to enjoy making films with documentary elements; 1995's To Die For is key in this respect, but there are several instances where it appears that Drugstore Cowboy is attempting to analyse it's characters from a documentary standpoint. Lead actor Matt Dillon has had a varied career, and many of his films haven't been the best. He can, however, be very proud of his lead performance here. Dillon looks the part that he's meant to be playing, as his good looks brilliantly offset the 'in the gutter' character and his acting talent, which has never been under question if you ask me, is allowed to shine through also. The rest of the cast don't stand out over the lead; although it's worth noting that this film features an early performance from Heather Graham. The atmosphere of the movie is gritty and dirty, and this is helped along by the grainy film stock that the movie has been shot on. The locations are well used also, and Van Sant ensures that the film takes place in the sort of atmosphere you would associate with junkies. Overall, this film is a good dissection of drugs and drug users and comes recommended.

It cheers me up and is so entertaining. It is meticulessly filled with nostalgic details, and silly, fun music. The characters are flawlessly played, so many good actors participated in this film. It is a fun and wholesome movie, my teenage daughter loved it too. It is even more fun if you have ever known anyone in a garage band, and who hasn't? It mirrors many events from the Ed Sullivan era when the Beatles became big. A great tale of the one hit wonder. Fiction in a very historical early '60's setting. This movie represents the light, fun side of early Rock n Roll, which is often over shadowed by the cruel, senseless events of war and the fight for civil rights that was happening during this time. Tom Hanks wrote, directed, acted in it, and even was involved in writing much of the music. His wife has a small part in it as well. I remember seeing Charlize Theron for the first time in this movie and thinking what a great actress she is. Same for TB player, who never has a real name in the movie, and Tom Everett Scott. The song was actually nominated for a Grammy award, it's real catchy! I bought the movie, and the sound track and wore them out. It will be one of those movie that people will appreciated more and more as time goes on, mostly because the main cast was virtually unknown and have gone on to do greater parts.

But his ex-girlfriend Tiffany (Jennifer Tilly) gets his remains and (using Voodoo for Dummies) revives him. Then, through circumstances too convoluted to get into, SHE is killed and has her soul put into another doll! Together they fall in love and kidnap a nice couple (Nick Stabile, Katherine Heigl) to take them to Chuck's coffin to get an amulet to make Chucky and Tiffany real people again...A lot better than it sounds. After the last two sequels to Child's Play (both of which were horrible) I was expecting the worst, but this actually was lots of fun. The movie doesn't take itself seriously for a second (seriously--how could it?) and the lines and situations are actually quite funny.

After his kingdom is overturned, a prince turned king by the death of his father sets out to find his kidnapped bride with the council of a wiseman named Ynyr, which sets him on a trek to find the spiked boomerang a veritable 'shiroken' and The Black Fortress. Along the way, he gathers a small army of common thieves, a fumbling sorcerer, a decrepit 'seer' with his boy-servant, and a cyclopes. For an action-adventure, this film contains much too much unnecessary dialogue, extensive traveling scenes, and a lot of climbing. Since the battle in the first twenty- minutes or so, the film remains rather slow until the last half hour, wherein 'Prince Colwyn' and shoddy troupe penetrate the fortress and do battle with The Beast, after predictably dispatching a large number of mis-aiming 'slayers'. In the end, 'Princess Lyssa' is rescued from the clutches of the wonderfully demonic monster, and they re-commence with their previously interrupted wedding by exchanging vows as well as a flame derived from water. The typical 'good' vs. 'evil' scenario exists here, most commonly displayed in the conclusion wherein in conjunction with the pentablade, this 'flame of love' overcomes the 'blasts of hatred' emitted from the Beast monster. This film seems to concentrate on more of a children's faerie-tale type of story, rather than a more mature version of the genre, and could very well have been animated. I suppose it may be more appreciated by Lord of The Rings \/ D&D -type of fans, yet with the exception of the impressive flying weapon and giant Beast creature, as far as fantasy-action-adventure, the film is a rather rudimentary presentation.

The lack of imagination, the reworking of the same old plots of the first film and, despite an impressive Titanic piece at one point, the overall restraint on special effects.The best part of the film was the courtroom scene where Louis hilariously referenced the first film when he declared that the Ghostbusters helped him after he was turned into a dog which lead to a climax with criminal ghosts The Scoleri Brothers going on a rampage.Everybody involved were really up for it (though I thought Janosz's voice got irritating after a while) but either the dialogue seemed poor or the delivery just didn't seem right, therefore missing as much as hitting with the wise-cracking. Oh, a heck of a lot of posturing was involved too. Four people having little to do in the film certainly had a lot to say for themselves, lol.The emotional attachment between Peter and Dana was unnecessary and mere plot padding as Venkman's wise-cracking attachment to her child ruined the character's credibility. I always felt that Venkman's goal in life was to avoid responsibility and emotional attachment so the plot development didn't feel right. I do get the feeling that Hollywood producers say; You know, we need to add forty extra minutes to the film what do we do? I know, let's add a romantic subplot.The Statue of Liberty scene was almost a remake of The Stay Puft Marshmallow man in the original film only this time the perspective was reversed. Instead of a bad marshmallow man lumbering about the city at the end we have a good Statue of Liberty lumbering about the city at the end. I guess the film was pretentiously talking about karma but I'm not sure the message was successful.Finally, Vigo was very lethargic when he finally crept out of the painting. I was wondering at one point whether he had emerged at all, lol.Some trivia for you...* The psychiatrist was played by Brian Doyle Murray - Bill Murray's brother. He again teamed with Murray in the film 'Groundhog Day' (which Harold 'Egon Spengler' Ramis directed).* In the scene where the effects of the slime was affecting New York, the people were running out of the cinema.

He went over a whole lot of ground he'd covered before and better.Jon Finch truly needed a keeper in Frenzy. He's a former Royal Air Force Pilot who's had a run of bad luck and he's walking around with one enormous chip on his shoulder. He says and does certain things and again has the rotten misfortune of being seen near the sight of one of the homicides of a serial killer. What Finch manages to do his very nicely implicate himself as the serial killer.Frenzy is a combination of a whole lot of Alfred Hitchcock chase movies like North By Northwest, Saboteur, The 39 Steps all involving wrongly accused men. None of them were ever quite as obtuse though as Jon Finch in Frenzy. Frenzy also draws from Dial M for Murder and To Catch a Thief where a sharp police official prevents a miscarriage of justice.The sharp police official is Alec McCowen who has some very nice scenes with wife Vivien Merchant who is taking a gourmet cooking class and is using hubby for a guinea pig when he's away from trying to solve the necktie murders. She may be ditzy, but her observations are quite sound.As it turns out the real murderer is quite close to home for Finch, but in the end he almost blows it for McCowen and Scotland Yard.The problem is that the real killer is in fact a serial killer who's killed quite a few women before the two that Finch was involved with. A good attorney should definitely have gotten Finch off on reasonable doubt. Best scene in Frenzy, the real killer trying to get a piece of evidence off the body of his latest victim who he's put in a potato sack and shipped with bags of other potatoes to a produce market. Hitchcock is playing with his audience, he's unmasked the killer, but you're not quite sure whether to hope he's caught or root for him to get away with it.Not the best of Hitch's later films.
