[{"date":"3 October 2001","score":"","review":"  Recently, I had the privilege of viewing the new directors cut of Apocalypse Now known as 'Redux'. It is simply a spectacular restoration of a movie that already was a masterpiece.Almost an hour worth of new footage has been added in. The original always had the sense of being hurried. This new version gives the film more breathing space and develops characters more. They cover a second encounter with the gunboat crew and the Playboy Bunnies seen previously at the U.S.O show and A much-talked about seen at a French Plantation. There is also additional footage of the Air Cavalry and some more footage from the Kurtz Compound.The best of the new footage is the added footage of the Air Cavalry and of Willard's Gunboat crew. The original cut never really explains why Captain Willard and his men leave after the attack on Charlie's Point so quickly; we assume it's to continue with their mission. 'Redux' explains why. I am not going to tell but this new footage shows more of the insanity of Colonel Kilgore and shows that Captain Willard is not the stone-faced, boring guy we assumed he was (He actually smiles!).But this is no ordinary Director's Cut, which basically throws in new footage and does nothing else. Francis Ford Coppola and Walter Murch (One of the original editors) have remade 'Redux' literally from scratch. The `new' footage has been restored to match with the original. In addition, Coppola and Murch might have changed some of the existing footage. What I mean is that they have not changed the scene itself, but the camera angle where it was filmed. For example, when Willard kills Kurtz, first off Kurtz is reading an Air Force statement that is banning crewman from putting the F-Word on their planes. In the original, when he was killed, it only showed a forward view of him as he was stabbed. In this version, Kurtz turns around before he is attacked and then shows a struggle between Kurtz and Willard, leading to Kurtz's eventual death.But even 'Redux' has its flaws. The encounter with the Playboy Bunnies, while harmless, doesn't really have anything to do with the film. It basically shows that people might get desperate enough in wartime to have sex in exchange for fuel. But the French Plantation is not as easy to sit through. Except for showing what the French think of American involvement in Vietnam (Negative of course) and more personality development for Captain Willard (He smokes opium and even has an attraction for a French woman), it has nothing to do with the film's plot. Some call this a trip through time and indeed it has an eerie feeling throughout (Largely because there is fog everywhere). However, I recently found an explanation for the plantation scene that makes sense; the whole journey up the river by Willard and the boat crew is a trip through time. They start off in the Vietnam War, then go to when Vietnam was a French Colony and then go to when it was ruled by savages. Also notice that before they arrive at the Plantation and after they leave it, there is a thick fog (A possible time warp?). However, the movie overall would not have suffered if this scene was left out and instead used as a DVD extra.Overall, while deliberately paced and a bit tedious (Plus it has graphic violence and many uses of four letter words), Redux proves to be as good if not better that the original. I wonder if it can be eligible for Oscar contendership. I doubt any of other movies this year would be much competition. For me, watching this movie was an unforgettable experience that cannot be summed up in words. If you don't believe me, see it for yourself!

The story revolves around the top-secret British code-breaking operation at Bletchley Park. One of the great secrets of World War II, it only became known to the World in the late 1970s and it has taken until now for a film to be made of the story.This is a fictional account and whilst the details are correct, the characters and plot were created for the story. Tom Jericho is a mathematician who broke into the German Naval 'Shark' cipher. With the ciphers broken, the British had been able to route convoys away from U-boats and continue the war. On a personal note, he became involved (on a very creaky bed) with the beautiful Claire and suffered a nervous breakdown from overwork. Jericho returns to Bletchley Park to find that Shark has changed. The British convoys cannot be protected from the U-Boats and the future of the War is at stake unless the codes can be broken. On a personal note, Claire is missing and the suspicion of murder points at Tom... then he discovers some mysterious ciphers from Eastern Europe.With a gently plodding pace, quiet score and long lingering shots of the English countryside 'Enigma' looks and feels like an ITV drama on a Sunday evening. Only the smell of greasy popcorn and rancid hotdogs told me I wasn't in the comfort of my own living room and I should behave with some decorum.A film that doesn't feel like a film isn't a bad thing, but at certain times 'Enigma' really did need to pick up the pace and run with the plot. Even the chases feel slow!The movie does fumble its two main climaxes by revealing them too early and one straight after the other. The scenes in which the Shark cipher is broken and the mysterious codes cracked *should* have been exciting, but they were nothing more than interesting. A shame because the preceding scenes of the gathering U-boats were filled with tension. And after these revelations the last 15 minutes feels a little superfluous, even though it should be leading to a point of high drama.Script wise Tom Stoppard does a good job of condensing the book into a movie and manages to avoid the common problem of movies requiring detailed knowledge that needs to be explained to the audience. All too often these movies drop into neutral, you get an information dump, and then the movie picks up again. Here most of the knowledge is imparted in the dialogue, with one exception - unless you know how codes were broken, the cracking of Shark is going to make no sense whatsoever.The dialogue feels right for the period and Stoppard has great fun with the reptilian Wigram (played with oily menace by Jeremy Northam), giving him most of the choice dialogue.Acting, its a mixed bunch. Three great central perfomances by Dougray Scott, Kate Winslet and Northam are almost wiped out by the sheer badness of Saffron Burrows. If it hadn't been for Estella Warren's non-performance in 'Planet of the Apes', Ms. Burrows would walk away with the award for 'Most annoying female character in a motion picture'. A one note performance that will grate on your nerves and raise the question 'does she honestly think she can act?' The film feels right, (although I doubt if Britain had fields of oil seed rape in the 1940s) and the drabness of the country comes across well. The coarse fabric, the terrible food and the backwardness of the country in comparison to America of the same period are all well produced and it is a big contrast to the gloss of U571 (which is not *that* bad a movie).Plus points for a film that has Germans speaking German and not in zee very heavily aczented English. Ja?A couple of minor problems that could have been resolved with some thought. It is hard to believe that security was quite so lax at Bletchley Park, if the movie is to be believed it is possible to borrow Britain's only Enigma machine from a secure room and no one will comment on it, likewise you can go to secure listening stations no one asks for authorisation?

It is a joy to watch these two professionals at work playing such likeable characters. They make you care about Robin and Quinn and that is what makes the film. I think Ford must have had a ball spoofing his macho image. The man has a definite comedic flair. Anne Heche is a truly underated performer who can do both comedy and drama. People would realize this if they just left her personal life out of it. People criticized David Schwimmer's performance, but I thought he was hilarious as Heche's dopey boyfriend. Ivan Reitman's direction is impeccable. I don't know where this film was made but its simply beautiful.

We're studying the Social Drama.  Last week we watched Fury with Spencer Tracy, so this week we watched a contemporary film in the genre.  I have to give it up for Peter Weir!  He did a spectacular job!The premise is intriguing.  A young Amish boy goes to the bathroom in a train station and witnesses a bloody murder.  Enter Philadelphia cop John Book (Harrison Ford).  Now, we had several discussions about this film and I started to realize some flaws that didn't exactly come clear in my mind at the time.  First of all, a little innocent Amish boy isn't going to witness something that grisly and recover that well.  Living in an Amish environment, he probably doesn't even know the definition of the word violence.  So the boy wouldn't be able to return to his native environment and go on with his life like usual.  He'd keep having nightmares and flashbacks.  He'd be traumatized 'til the day he dies!  However, I have to note Lukas Haas delivered a terrific performance.  I'm not sure how much appraise he got for this moderately thankless role.  For a boy of his age to take on a role like that, I have to commend him.  Lukas, in recent years, has concentrated on more independent works like Boys with Wynona Ryder and the underrated johns with David Arquette, in which he plays a gay prostitute.  He's still a fine actor, and I'm impressed to see his advancement to more grown-up roles, but many probably forgot about him. So I think he should be remembered for that little role, even to this day. But typical Hollywood, Harrison Ford agrees to do a film--he's the star!  And the whole subplot with the little boy gets pushed aside.  Now, Harrison was terrific in this movie--probably why I wasn't bothered too much about him being the center of attention--and I think he's a very underrated actor (sure he's widely known, but recognize him more as a macho action hero than an actor), but I think if Weir decided to expand that subplot it would've made a more interesting film.Kelly McGillis is convincing as the boy's Amish mother, who gets swept away by Book.  Even as an Amish woman, I think she looked beautiful.  I haven't exactly been traveling around Amish country, but I don't know how often you would find an Amish woman that beautiful.  Plus, that scene where she's sponge-bathing topless--Wow!  That brings me to another point.  I like how Weir never actually decided to put a sex scene to demonstrate the relationship between her and Book.  In the aforementioned sponge-bathing scene, there's a long period where they just stare at each other and there's absolutely no dialogue!  I found that very impressive.  It's a very erotic scene, without them actually having to jump into bed together.  That's something you rarely see in the movies.  The sexual tension between the two characters is simply impressed by their mannerisms.  Danny Glover is convincingly frightening as the villain.  Also look for an early performance by Viggo Mortensen.  He doesn't have many--in fact, I don't if he has any--speaking parts, but he's in quite a few scenes.There's a lot of good fish-out-of-water comedy when the city-born Book tries to learn the ways of the Amish.  I was cracking up when Harrison puts on the Amish garb, with the bottom of his pants above his ankles.  That's a picture worth a thousand words.  Weir is fascinated by clashes in cultures, and it's highly evident in many scenes from this movie.  Those scenes provide some good comic relief.  This may be considered typical Hollywood, but I loved the scene where Harrison Ford gets out of the chariot (now as one of the Amish) to beat the crap out of one of the thugs who was giving them trouble. That was an awesome scene!  Weir also captures some beautiful, sometimes breathtaking, shots of the scenery.  The music is great too, especially in the barn-raising scene.  The ending is well-done, and I liked how it wasn't one of those walk-into-the-sunset conclusions.  I don't want to give anything away, but that was one of the non-typical Hollywood elements of the film.Despite its now-discovered flaws, I still love this movie and wouldn't mind watching it on many repeat viewings.  It's just a fascinating, wonderfully made piece of cinema that will hold its place in the history of celluloid.

Scenes that have not been found are represented by still photographs over which we hear the original dialogue. This is therefore not exactly the movie that was released to the theatres, but a fairly close approximation of it.The story concerns a planeload of passengers hijacked during a violent uprising in China who find themselves ultimately in Tibet, where the plane crashes, and are met by guides who lead them up a steep mountain to the valley of Shanri-La. In Shangri-La the weather is always perfect. There is no war or violence because the people's motto is 'be kind', and they live up to it. In other words, they are in paradise. The valley has a history, too complex to go into in any great depth, and the perfect climate enables its inhabitants to live very long lives.As one might imagine, there is trouble in paradise, and some of the visitors decide to leave. Shangri-La does not automatically make people happy. One still has to work at it, albeit under extraordinarily favorable circumstances. The movie is far from flawless, and the middle section, with the usual romantic stuff, is none too inspired; but it begins with a bang and very nearly ends with one, too. In the chaotic, early scenes there is a palpable sense of danger; and the generous budget enabled Capra to use large crowds, and he makes the most of them. Rarely, on screen, have large numbers of human beings, whether screaming, shooting or pushing, seemed so frightening. The airborne part of the film is likewise very satisfying. There's a good deal of exposition here, but it's so well done that one can scarcely find fault.

The soaring over the clouds is mesmerizing in its simple beauty; while the crash-landing of the plane at what appears to be the foot of the mountain that leads eventually to Shangri La, is highly effective.

Conway does not want to leave, but his younger brother is in love with a Russian girl, who is unhappy in paradise and talks aginst the locals. As Conway is discussing the matter with his brother, inside, we hear wordless chanting outside, in what sounds like a religious ceremony, as robed figures carrying candles form a long line that surrounds the building, then pass on. As the talk inside becomes more heated, the voices (and accompanying music) grow louder. By the time Conway has made his decision to leave, and is walking up the hill to the opening in the rocks that will lead him from the warm, friendly valley to the freezing tempratures of the outisde world, the music rises in intensity, to a kind of lugubrious, hynoptic crescendo, providing a perfect auditory counterpart to the journey Conway is embarking on, and his mixed feelings about it. The result is one of the single most moving and lovely scenes in movies, technically and emotionally devastatingly effective.

Her character, Suzannah's pain <I feel> isn't caused so much by Tristan, it simply rivals it.I like the narration by One Stab, and feel like this is one of the rare formats where a storyteller really serves its purpose.  Narration in film is often abused, but here, it is poetic and symbollic.If the viewer cannot sit through this movie and find something to cheer about in the final confrontation of the Ludlows & O'Banion's, well, I'm sorry; you're truly missing some great storytelling.

I love intelligent humor as much as anyone, but its a lot more fun to laugh out loud with friends over the stupidest little things than have a quaint chuckle alone at irony.  This is why the world needs films like Zoolander.Most stupid comedies of late have been just that - stupid, weighed down by bad toilet and sex humor.  But here we have a comedy with a lead that takes his stupidity in stride down the walkway, and its (unlike most stupid comedies of late) really funny.  Ben Stiller (who also directed) is great as Derek Zoolander, a male model who wows the fashion world with his trademark brilliant look blue steel, and gives critics a headache with his less-than-brilliant manners of speaking.  Stiller's intentional bad-acting gives Zoolander an even greater degree of stupidness, in all his blunders and absurdities; he really is THAT funny, especially in a did he just say what I think he said? sort of way because he really is THAT stupid. The film doesn't have the greatest longevity, since it removes most of the effect once you know what Zoolander will do or say next, and as the film winds down he actually gets a little smarter (fear not! a smarter Zoolander is still dumber than anyone you'll ever meet).  The most absurd moments, including Zoolander as a merman, a fashion awards ceremony that begins Zoolander's retirement, and a walk-off competition between Zoolander and his biggest competition, extreme-sports-model\/stoner Hansel (Owen Wilson) refereed by David Bowie, are by far the film's most (only?) memorable aspects, but as mentioned earlier, they're that absurd and that dumb that they stick around for a while.  There is also some subtle intelligent parody of the fashion industry and in-jokes that keep the film fresh for discussion with friends past the memorable moment's expiration dates.This obviously doesn't appeal to everyone (people who don't like cliches in their plots, for instance).  But to those that it does appeal to, its great fun, especially after all those disappointing summer blockbusters.

My biggest problem with the film is that it tries too hard to tip its hat to Kubrick, but misses the mark completely. And then to rub salt in the wound the ending is tacked on like a post-it note at the end of an average sci-fi novel.There was a fantastic opportunity to really explore the story in a way not seen since Blade Runner. fair enough, it would be hard to surpass that film, but you would think that Spielberg would be able to come close. Someone should tell him that there is nothing wrong with an ending that leaves people hanging. It would have made more sense to leave it at the 'fake' ending, a disjointed conclusion to an equally disjointed film.If you are going to take on as complex a story as this, you should be certain that you can answer more questions than you create. Rebadging pinnocchio and then changing the end doesn't live up to expectations.I have seen a few reviews which are confident that this film will see renewed support in future years.

A film can completely change my outlook on parts of life. Zoolander did indeed make a lasting impression.on my view of male super models. I can honestly say I'll never look at another Calvin Klien billboard the same way again, but that isn't exactly a towering accomplishment.Zoolander is not supposed to make a lasting impression; it's flimsy, 90-minute escapism. Though I didn't laugh very much in this nonsensical comedy either, although it does contain some funny material involving the title character's stupidity, and it benefits from keeping its tongue firmly in cheek.Following the success of his blockbuster comedies Meet the Parents and There's Something About Mary, Ben Stiller gathered family and friends to make Zoolander, an original, stylish satire on the fashion industry. Based on a 1996 VH1\/Vogue Fashion Awards character Stiller co-created with MTV Movie Awards writer\/producer Drake Sather, Zoolander is quite pleased with its unique sense of humor, but unique does not necessarily spell funny.Stiller plays Derek Zoolander, who has defended his title of Male Model of the Year for three consecutive years now, but this year his competition gets the best of him. A dashing, red-hot newcomer, Hansel (Owen Wilson) nabs the award, sending Zoolander home with nothing but a low self-image. Shocked by these and other tragic events, Derek wonders if there's more to life than being really, really good looking. He returns to his Southern roots only for his coal miner father (Jon Voight) to disown him. Enter a diabolical plot to assassinate the prime minister of Malaysia, and you have yourself the visually amusing concept of Zoolander.Ben Stiller has the stuff here, as does Owen Wilson, Jon Voight, SNL veteran Will Ferrell, Jerry Stiller, and Milla Jovovich. I especially enjoyed the charismatic performance by Ben Stiller's real life wife, Christine Taylor as an aggressive Time Magazine Reporter. Andy Dick, Fabio, Cuba Gooding Jr., Donald Trump, Natalie Portman, Winona Ryder, Billy Zane, and Garry Shandling and other big stars appear for satiric cameos. There's a lot of talent involved with this film, which makes it all the more tragic that it doesn't work.Ben Stiller, who also directs, writes, and producers this movie, has a lot of fun. During pre-production, Stiller and Owen Wilson spent two days being photographed by Frank Ockenfels to create model portfolios for Zoolander and Hansel. They posed in mock ad campaigns for Gucci, Perry Ellis, Tommy Hilfiger and Evian, as well as bogus magazine covers for GQ, Details, Rolling Stone, Surfer, American Way, ESPN and the International Male catalog.Filmed in New York City and Los Angeles, the film creates an enjoyable world of glamorous fashion fiction. Production designer Robin Standefer and costume designer David C. Robinson imagine lush, outrageous, exotic costumes and images that greatly contribute to character development. Even with such a complex visual arena, however, Zoolander flops. It's visually entertaining, yes, but the story is not interesting, the characters one-dimensional, and the attempt at humor only occasionally makes us grimace. It's dazzling, flavorful candy for our eyes, but Zoolander is all style without substance.

Secondly, it co-stars the repeatedly brutal Luke Wilson.  i.e. Soul Survivors, Home Fries etc.  However, somehow this movie overcomes those two details to be a rather enjoyable little flick.Legally Blonde is the story of Californian blonde bombshell Elle Woods(Reese Witherspoon).

However, my friend failed to mention to me that Luke Wilson was in it.  My friend Dr.ben knows that I can't stand Luke Wilson!  Naturally, when I read his name in the opening credits, I became a lot fearful.  However after the fact, I have never seen Wilson so absent of annoyance.  I actually liked him in this movie.

It's no Adam Sandler or Chris Farley comedy (unfortunately), but it had its fair share of chuckles.
