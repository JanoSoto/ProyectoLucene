[{"date":"2 November 2010","score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" 'Almost Famous' is almost a masterpiece, presenting so authentic a re-creation of American musical culture during the 1970s that it deserves to be seen as an act of witness, not unlike the flip side to 'This Is Spinal Tap', but without the mocking satire. The film is a thinly disguised, sentimental flashback to when writer-director Cameron Crowe was a precocious teenage music journalist, coming of age while covering for Rolling Stone magazine the ups and downs of life on the road with the (here fictitious, but entirely convincing) band Sweetwater.First-hand experience and a pitch-perfect memory put Crowe in full command of his material, but it's too bad he couldn't assert the same authority over the editing table as well. The film (like so many these days) is at least twenty minutes too long, thanks (indirectly) to Steven Spielberg, who reportedly urged Crowe to shoot every word in what must have been, for many years, an un-produced pet screenplay. The result is padded by the effort needed to gift wrap and resolve every conflict as neatly and happily as possible, contradicting the director's own message (voiced by character actor, screen chameleon Philip Seymour Hoffman as the venerable rock critic Lester Bangs) about good writing being honest and merciless.But never mind. The film was never meant to be too much more than textbook crowd-pleasing fluff, crafted with an affectionate eye for period detail as seen through a not inappropriate rose-colored lens. Sex, drugs, and rock 'n' roll were never quite such wholesome fun; a distinction is even drawn between the usual clutch of groupies and much more lovable 'band aids' like Kate Hudson, whose fresh, photogenic appeal was obviously meant to charm viewers in much the same demure way that she romances Crowe's love struck young protagonist.So why did the movie, contrary to critical expectations, fail at the box office? Maybe it was the relative lack of charisma in the lead character, an obvious analogue of the writer-director himself, portrayed in this deprecating self-portrait as too bland and unlikely a paragon of journalistic virtue. With a little more edge and depth it might have been a career-making role (think of the unknown Tom Cruise circa 'Risky Business'), but all the skills of young Patrick Fugit aren't enough to fill the featureless gap at the heart of an otherwise lively and colorful cast.Or maybe the film was simply made a decade too late. Crowe wants us to believe, as he does, in the redemptive power of musical expression, a romantic idea fast becoming another anachronistic casualty of push-button progress. Times have changed, and now there's an entire movie-going generation with no nostalgic memory of gatefold album cover art, or the unique thrill of settling a phonograph needle into a virgin groove of freshly unwrapped vinyl.For the sake of audio clarity and convenience (i.e. not having to get up and flip the LP over) we've lost touch with a small link to our collective adolescence. Here's a movie that tries (too late?) to remind us of how we lived back when music really mattered, before it was put on a tight corporate leash and sold, with true Pavlovian skill, as TV ad soundtrack fodder.Maybe, to best appreciate Crowe's slice of cultural nostalgia, you just had to have been there yourself.

Harry agrees but their old van breaks down in a small town called Glenboro, needing money to pay for the repairs Skip & Harry are hired by a bank to sing a song dressed as Woodpeckers.

Simple. I won't say that you will find Stir Crazy as funny as I did but I think you would need to be pretty devoid of emotion not to find at least some of it amusing & as I said I think it's often outright hilarious. The film starts off almost entirely as a showcase for the comedic pairing of Wilder & Pryor with some terrific scenes including the Woodpecker dance, the 'I'm bad' scene in jail, some priceless one-liners & reactions to the general likability of the two leads as they turn the material into gold. However once the rodeo aspect & jail break angle kicks in during the second half of the film the comedy seems to take a back seat as gambling, cheating & an odd jail break (why did Harry have to go back into the rodeo? Why couldn't Rory & Jesus climb up the shaft & into the popcorn thing like Harry & Skip do?) take center stage. Also the ending is a little silly & unsatisfying in it's attempt to finish as quickly as possible, sure Harry & Skip have been acquitted but that still leaves the fact they broke out of jail & helped two other convicted criminals including a murderer to escape too.

While there is plenty of bad language & profanity there's no violence to speak of. Apparently Richard Pryor refused to wear the Woodpecker suit while filming but strangely did wear for the poster & promotional materials.Apparently a big success at the time even though the critics generally hated it, some of the country & western style music & songs are a little nerve grating & distracting but nothing too major. The acting is good, Wilder & Pryor in particular are brilliant here as a pairing & it's said a lot of scenes were improvised between the two. Even though their character's never meet in Stir Crazy both JoBeth Williams & Craig T.

Miss Giddens (The King and I's Deborah Kerr) arrives at the estate with total independence and authority, she warms to Flora very quickly, and then Miles is sent home for wickedness in boarding school. Slowly Miss Giddens starts to see and hear things in the house, and the children are behaving very strangely, and she asks housemaid Mrs. Grose (Worzel Gummidge's Megs Jenkins) about past history. She asks about the fate of the previous governess Miss Jessel (Clytie Jessop) and the former valet Peter Quint (Peter Wyngarde), two servants who were in love with each other, and apparently had a bad incident took their lives. Miss Giddens is convinced that the house is haunted, and the innocent children are being almost possessed into going insane, and she is willing to against these supernatural forces. Though her struggle against the spirits seems to go the right, in the end there has to be tragedy when Miss Giddens sees the unpleasant Miles meet his fate in a bit of a bizarre fashion. Also starring Isla Cameron as Anna. Kerr does really well as the terrified governess, the children are very creepy in the obvious moments, and there are some good creepy scenes using early special effects, surprising it is almost neglected, a great classic haunted house style horror.

She asks about the fate of the previous governess Miss Jessel (Clytie Jessop) and the former valet Peter Quint (Peter Wyngarde), two servants who were in love with each other, and apparently had a bad incident took their lives. Miss Giddens is convinced that the house is haunted, and the innocent children are being almost possessed into going insane, and she is willing to against these supernatural forces. Though her struggle against the spirits seems to go the right, in the end there has to be tragedy when Miss Giddens sees the unpleasant Miles meet his fate in a bit of a bizarre fashion. Also starring Isla Cameron as Anna. Kerr does really well as the terrified governess, the children are very creepy in the obvious moments, and there are some good creepy scenes using early special effects, surprising it is almost neglected, a great classic haunted house style horror. It was nominated the BAFTAs for Best British Film and Best Film from any Source. Very good!
