In short, it works; but realising how absurd the film may have turned out and noting how grounded and enjoyable it turns out in actuality, is the true pleasure. In conforming to whatever written rule or code of conduct the toys seemingly had in the first film, in relation to keeping the magic of their life a secret from human beings, the first maintained a wondrously consistent close knit sense that avoiding all manner of extravagant activity was a good thing; rendering the finale with Syd in which the code is broken all the more dramatic and involving. Toy Story 2 sees the toys commit grand theft auto; cause a motorway pile up and execute all manner of expansive activity in airports, on runways and other such public places without much trouble - all whilst seemingly going unnoticed. But it is to the film's great credit we become so wrapped up in the tale, a tale of rescue; honour and friendship, despite these absurdities; as the ideologies and the true extent of the point of their existence in both the protagonist and supporting toys are questioned. This is certainly one of the most philosophical films about a child's play thing you'll ever see.Like the first film, Toy Story 2 sees one toy excluded from the space of Andy's room at their new house after having successfully moved at the end of the first one. On this occasion, Woody is stolen at a junk sale on the front lawn of Andy's house during the rescuing of another toy up for sale; the crime perpetrated by an eccentric, chain store owning toy collector named Al (Knight) whom recognises Woody as a rare and expensive collectors item, also a part of a collection of Western themed toys from the 1950s. With an ultimatum in place, the going away of Andy to something called 'cowboy camp' during the summer holiday, the usual gang of Andy's toys in Buzz; Potatoe Head; Rex and Hamm venture off to find him - as Buzz and the other toys take off to rescue Woody before Andy gets home, the camera enjoys a slow crane upwards so as to encompass Al's high-rise which towers over all the other buildings as the magnitude of their mission is enforced.Primarily, the study of a toy's fear of being replaced from the first film has been updated to that of a toy's shelf life running out in regards to an owner's lust to continue using them. 1995's Toy Story was a circular adventure unfolding out of the Utopian space that was Andy's room, an adventure which saw Woody having come to terms with having to coexist with a newer, fresher, more post-modern toy as Buzz's own arc was explored in that he was not, in fact, a space ranger himself. Here, the venturing away from Andy's new room allows Woody to come to terms with the 'issue' or 'problem' of Andy's growing older, and that it too is a serious topic infused within the life of a toy one needs to come to terms with and coexist with, leading to acceptance.If anything, the film opens up with a mini-narrative of which resembles a short cartoon; the sort of which you might have play before the feature at a cinema years ago. The expanding of the opening short into this dramatic and blown out of proportion epic as Buzz Lightyear attempts to infiltrate and defeat his nemesis Emperor Zurg is systematic of Toy Story 2's own branching out into larger, more grandeur adventures. We ought to know it's not real, because Buzz resembles his old, deluded self. As the film develops and Woody is taken to a large high-rise marked with a sign in its reception stating No Children, so as to further infuse the watching kids in the audience to 'side' with the toys and further dislike Al, Andy's toys strive to get him back and Woody himself encounters Jessie (Cusack), Stinky Pete (Grammer) and a horse named Bullseye; of which the four of them combine together to produce Woody's Roundup Gang, a franchise favourite with the kid's back in the 1950s.The film is enjoyable in its inter-cutting of Al's own plight, which includes the bickering with some Japanese businessmen whom are purchasing the Roundup Gang, his strand providing short, sharp bouts of comedy; with Andy's toys' journeying to the building, as Buzz's superiority is emphasised in his cracking of whom the kidnapper is, and Woody himself facing a moral plight of his own in regards to whether he abandons Jessie, Pete and Bullseye so as to return to Andy. In particular, Woody's own arc sees him somewhat loose his head when it transpires he is quite the celebrity figure; both then and now, something that is observed and dealt with within the universe of the film as a relatively negative thing when said character realises there are things that are more important in life. The film wonderfully blends in all of this with its grander physical comedy and the cynicism of both Hamm and Potatoe Head, something that clashes with various other toys whom become involved along the way, one of whom is a second Buzz Lightyear doll acting as a short, sharp and refreshing inclusion. It's bigger, but not better; although thoroughly enjoyable all the same.

There's something so extreme, so garish about her face that it almost seems right when punishment is inflicted on her.And what manners of misfortune visit her as Mildred Pierce! There's more misery packed into its 109 minutes than you'll find in a week's worth of Lifetime weepers.Yes, this is the kind of movie where a character coughs three times and then two scenes later dies of pneumonia. Lots happens in Mildred Pierce, but it remains dramatically inert; most scenes consist of two characters talking about another.Talk, talk, talk. The people in Mildred Pierce tell each other what they're going to do (or what they've just done) and make pronouncements about themselves at every opportunity. It's a wonder any of them can stand each other for five minutes, much less the years the story covers.I understand that James M. Cain, who also gave us Double Indemnity and The Postman Always Rings Twice, considered his novel a departure from his usual fare. But this exposition-filled adaptation gussies up what's fundamentally a straightforward women's drama with seedy, sordid intrigue and a whodunit.You can call Mildred Pierce a film noir, but that doesn't make it one. It's *shot* like noir, but in every other respect is a standard melodrama. Michael Curtiz, who just three years before had delivered all-time classics Casablanca and Yankee Doodle Dandy, no doubt made the movie he wanted to. It just doesn't stand the test of time. What heralded contemporary movies will play, 60 years from now, like this Mildred Pierce does?

Joe Clay and Kirsten Arnesen are completely different people by the end, even by the middle, than they are at the beginning. It's a dark drama on alcoholism by the last working studio-era Hollywood director, Blake Edwards, who barely lets on that alcohol plays a central role in the relationship of these two people until it begins to take a toll on them. It's human nature to try to make sense of what happens in the present by noting what went before, and Lemmon eventually does that, and only then do we really begin to see how drink elusively kept them dependent on one another.It is fascinating and painfully absorbing to follow most of the time. The rest of the time, the Jenga tower starts to wobble. After a very slow, natural decline into chemical addiction by Jack Lemmon as Joe, he and the script begin leaping from the railings of the stairwells down, and we find his life in a nightmarish disarray that very few people reach after living the first thirty-some years so comparatively well, most likely even the biggest failure you know. It's when he climbs out of the firepit that he becomes convincing again, and yet that's when Kirsten is found to be twice the horrific shambles he was, with a jaw-gaping lack of concern or even apparent thought for their very young daughter. As strong as the great Jack Lemmon's acting always was, I find Kirsten better served by Remick than the script, and Joe alternating between overacted and overwritten.It is sensationalist in its relentless, shocking depiction of its subject, but it is also a purely human story, a chronicle of two people's relationship with one another, a very emotional one. It angrily ponders the indignant question of why if people love each other can their being together be poison. It can give you a knot in your chest seeing how it can feel so much like love, and still not be. As well, Days of Wine and Roses indeed had a lasting effect in helping alcoholics face their problem.

The other is how it is made, which was impressive at the time and equally so now--even more so, considering how it has aged so well. I truly tells a story, and Michael Caine is brilliant, subtle, chilling, and believable in the starring role of Alfie.On the first score, there is something unsettling, really really funny, and daring about the subject--a true cad, a British young man who has his way with women but only, it seems, in the most superficial way, emotionally. You want to hate him for it, but he's so likable, and so honest, and fresh, and frankly charming to the gills, you can't help but have mixed feelings. Caine defines the role so thoroughly, in the remake, you feel Jude Law trying not to be Alfie, but be Michael Caine (and it doesn't work nearly as well).On the second, the way the movie was made, with many long takes, and with the main character (and no one else) narrating directly into the camera, but often in the middle of real action, is uncanny and virtuosic. Everyone involved had to have been sharp as a tack to get this right, the timing and feel, the light and the deadpan acting (I saw a crack of a smile during the long clinic scene). It makes for a dry approach, in a way, and it forces detachment from the plot proper. But it draws you into Alfie's plight, and flight, and complicated character. There are other movies made in the mid 1960s that are about the early and mid 1960s in working class London without trying to be, but this is among the best, like Easy Rider is clearly about the later 1960s in America. The new mores of the fresh sexual revolution are just being sorted out by cast and character and audience, almost before our eyes as we watch. It's quite remarkable, really. There's a lot of talk, and if you don't get into that pace right away you'll be doomed. But if you connect, and see the brilliance of it, you'll be blown away. Singular and special.Notice also the terrific music by Sonny Rollins, and of course the famous title song, sung by Cher. And though Michael Caine steals the show, the rest of the cast is spot on serious and authentic. Oddly, this is roughly the same time as the recent An Education and it has a little echo in some ways.

This is one of them.In 1876, Leopold (Hugh Jackman), the Duke of Albany, is being pressured to marry for the sake of bringing cash to his name. But the arrogant and proper Duke wants to wait for love. At the dance where he's supposed to choose a wife, he sees something strange. A man (Liev Schrieber) has been taking pictures of him all day with a tiny little camera. Leopold follows the man, and ends up in 2001. While there, he meets, and subsequently falls for, the man's ex-girlfriend, Kate McCoy (Meg Ryan).This is not a departure for Meg Ryan in the least.

I have prior to this never seen a David Lynch movie though I've heard quite a bit about Blue Velvet and Mullholland Drive for sure. I rented Mullholland Drive because of Naomi Watts, an actress I admire greatly. The first time I watched the movie, it played as a straight up tale of an aspiring actress mostly, if jumbled and what I thought was blah oddball blah \/messy at times. Like I say I have never watched a Lynch movie before. Since I had the movie on rental I decided to make the most of it and give it another go. I have now become obsessed with it. You see I went along with the movie, I went with the flow.At the moment I am in love with Betty's storyline but the movie has a lot more going on. It will take me time and a re watch, oh what a hard life, of Adam's (played by Justin Theroux) interactions with the producers and with The Cowboy. I also still don't have a clue about the two dudes laughing one minute in an office, and quite a different story the next. And much has been made of the kiss scene. To me, it's not that big a deal, I would say more sad than titillating, and even though I enjoy titillating, it's not the thing that sticks in my mind about Mullholland Drive. Sad that people talk about that over a brutal shooting in a movie.I had read some time ago the different interpretations of Mullholland Drive. The movie is haunting not because of the interpretations but because of the Winkies diner scene and the ending. And now, I see something else that gives me creeps in such a way I fell in love with Naomi Watts for being able to convey something through one look, the power of mental strength.

The secrets all comes alive when a black optometrist Hortense (Marianne Jean-Baptiste) pays a visit to her biological mother after her parents passed on. A social worker recommended not to seek out her real parents, but Hortense being passive of the warning decides to fulfill her search. Hortense phones her birth mother Cynthia (Brenda Blethyn), a frustrated factory worker who lives with her 20 year old daughter Roxanne (Claire Rushbrook). After a series of disastrous phone calls, they finally get to to meet each other, much to the doubt in Cynthia's mind that she has a black daughter. And then suddenly, Cynthia starts to recall an event that happened to her a long time ago. We the audience are manipulated to believe that she was raped, but that was never really revealed. That's the uniqueness of director Mike Leigh's characters. They seem to have dark pasts that are really never touched. Another nice plus is that there is no racial issues between Hortense and her newly acquainted disjointed family. With the only exception being the doubt of Cynthia having a black daughter.As we follow Hortense on her journey, we also take focus on Cynthia's younger brother, Maurice (Timothy Spall) who's a successful photographer by profession. The movie itself isn't all drama and seriousness, there's plenty of humor added to the fray as well. One of the funnier moments is when Maurice is taking pictures of different people. The people behind those photographs gives you that felling of how they wish to be represented. Maurice has been estranged from his sister for quite a long time, mainly due to his cold, self-important wife Monica (Phyllis Logan). The pivotal moments happen when Hortense is invited to a barbecue and Cynthia decides to open up to the family revealing that Hortense is her daughter. Roxanne becomes distraught, Cynthia get emotional, and Maurice is at a loss of words. The dialogue of the movie title itself where the family is torn apart by the spilling of the beans doesn't offer much for the audience to draw up their own conclusions, but the overdone dialogue can be forgiven thanks mainly due to these earth-shattering revelations. With a group of lesser known performers, this movie would've been a dud. Sure the initiative in this movie was a bit painful to watch. The bombs that drop look like they're almost ready to explode. And we sympathize with Hortense by throwing the towel at her at what she's getting herself into. Bleak as the film might be, it still inspires you take take a closer look at your family and to say to yourself, that you are all very lucky. Every performer does an incredible performance with top honors to Blethyn, this movie will stick to your ribs for a long time to come.

I'd love him even more as a war leader if he hadn't dodged real service in WW2 (sorry, Duke fans, just keepin' it real).- Great story, even greater since it is largely true.- William Holden does a nice job with a not very glamorous role of the anti-war physician.- I've read a lot of criticism of Constance Towers as the female lead, but I fell for her character hook, line and sinker. Very sexy and believable.- Fabulous Ford military fetishism. The silhouetted columns of cavalry are macho poetry. - Typically wonderful Ford soundtrack, full of authentic period marches and folk songs.- Nice balance struck between portraying the Union soldiers in a positive light, yet remaining respectful of the Confederates.Now here's what kept it from being better- As mentioned above, I have problems with Wayne playing a war hero. Jimmy Stewart, Duke's peer, volunteered for combat in WW2 and flew dozens of almost suicidal bombing missions over Germany. He survived and vowed never to star in a movie that glorified war. In fact, on several occasions, he played a peacemaker (Broken Arrow, for example). By comparison, Duke's legacy is embarrassing. Out of respect to veterans like Stewart, he should have refused war roles.- As is typical with Duke movies after 1950, he's way too old for the woman playing against him in the romantic subplot. He didn't start playing characters his real age until well into the 1960's.- There's no well defined heavy. This can be a problem when retelling real events.

My first warning signs came when there's a whole minute and a half of a black screen before the menu, with four monotonous voices talking about how the screen is black. It wasn't funny, not even for its 'WTF factor'!I managed to chuckle about three times (the stonehenge bit, the 'trapped in the pod' bit, and the tight trousers scenes- three funny moments; three stars. That's generous) over this incredibly short film, but the entire film was the exact same joke (that they're idiots and they're not very popular) played out over and over again. I've heard that 90% of this is improv- and it FEELS like improv. Poorly done improv. I've done improv work on stage before- an idiot is by far the easiest character to improvise for, because you can be as slow as you want, and you just have to say random stuff and pretend you don't understand things to get laughs. A 13 year old could come up with better lines- when I was in primary school, I was pretending to confuse 'sexist' and 'sexy'. The best bits by far were the scripted parts- the concerts and such.However, this film has loads of fans, so I can only deduce that these are people who saw it when it was new, and it just hasn't aged well. I've seen almost all of the gags done elsewhere- Spinal Tap probably did it first, but other shows\/mockumentaries do it better. The worst parts are plodding scenes of inane talking that leave you confused, wondering if what you just saw was supposed to be funny or not. It's not that I 'didn;t get it'- I got the jokes, they just weren't that funny- far too obvious for my liking. There was no subtlety in it at all- what you see is what you get. There's no plot to speak of, but a series of gags crudely stitched together, with more cul-de-sacs and pointless story arcs than your average episode of Family Guy. Maybe it was the hype. Maybe I was expecting too much from the 'greatest comedy of all time', but I absolutely hated it.

The worst parts are plodding scenes of inane talking that leave you confused, wondering if what you just saw was supposed to be funny or not. It's not that I 'didn;t get it'- I got the jokes, they just weren't that funny- far too obvious for my liking. There was no subtlety in it at all- what you see is what you get. There's no plot to speak of, but a series of gags crudely stitched together, with more cul-de-sacs and pointless story arcs than your average episode of Family Guy. Maybe it was the hype. Maybe I was expecting too much from the 'greatest comedy of all time', but I absolutely hated it. There really is nothing more to it than the clips you see on TV and reviewing programmes!The bottom line- if you're a fan, great! Enjoy it! But if you're a noobie, AVOID!

Many period pieces have been made after the fact, that require the audience to trust that the research has been done and that what they are watching is a plausible representation of that era. It takes a special kind of film to effortlessly appear legitimate to any generation that would be exposed to it, and any kind of social or political commentary it was trying to make can be easily swallowed. I insist that On The Waterfront exemplifies that analogy.Anyone who is new to Marlon Brando and is curious to know why he is universally considered a great American actor will benefit from starting with this film. Brando is coulda-been a contender prize fighter Terry Malloy, who is a product of his upbringing in the NY slums. Having flushed his career by taking a dive to satisfy the pockets of local gang figureheads - specifically a Johnny Friendly played seamlessly by an intimidating Lee J.Cobb - he has long since settled into a blue color job at the docks as provided by his benefactor.The well oiled machine of underground criminal activity motors along, until Terry is confronted by a moral dilemma. His conscious is awakened by the the naive and beautiful Edie Doyle, sister of a recently eliminated snitch, whom Terry unintentionally had a significant part in murdering. Her brother was a stand up kid who everybody liked, and Edie lingers around the crime scene desperate for someone to help her learn the truth. While the locals generally sympathize, no one is dumb enough to point in Johnny Friendly's direction lest they meet a similar fate.Terry doesn't care much about the gang or street politics; he is a simple man with a simple instinct for survival. Its unfortunate that these cats get away with extortion and murder, but what is he supposed to do about it, right? Terry tries to adhere to the unspoken code that keeps him alive and working. His empathy for this pretty little fish out of water wears away at him, as do the righteous, fiery speeches of catholic priest Father Barry (Karl Malden) who boldly dedicates himself to abolishing gang oppression in his part of town once and for all. The priest implores people to do the right thing and go to the authorities with any knowledge they have of this young man's unfortunate passing. Terry's dilemma is made all the more difficult because his own brother Charlie is bookkeeper to the devil.Terry has his own reasons for despising Johnny Friendly for the loss of his promising career as a boxer, but it takes the distress of a lovely blond girl to ignite the fire within him. In a fantastic, memorable third act, Terry takes a stand and a beating in front of his fellow co-workers. Though battered to a pulp, he gathers himself and limps his way to the warehouse to do his job, proving that Johnny Friendly is only as powerful as the people allow him to be.On the Waterfront is an uncomplicated film that truly captures the essence of post war late 1940s, where corrupt union officials ran rampant and the city streets were brimming with downtrodden, luckless civilians that lived to work and worked to live. We see very little of the politics, rather we live the side effects along with Terry.There are still many classic movies I have to catch up on; and certainly classics by the same director Elia Kazan such as A Streetcar Named Desire and A Face In The Crowd. I am more eager to do so knowing that this director, as proved in On The Waterfront, appreciates his subject matter, and elicits strong performances from his actors.

Andrew invites Milo to his country retreat and proposes a mutually beneficial solution, but can Milo trust him ?Sleuth is a real treat. It's ingenious, it's very funny and it features two pretty unforgettable performances from the inimitable leads. It's based on a play by Anthony Schaffer (who also wrote Frenzy and The Wicker Man) and it's just a peach of an idea - a simple revenge story dressed up as an elaborate prank which then cleverly transmutates into a treatise on class struggle. It has a big midway twist which the jaded may criticise as either unfair or obvious without really appreciating how much fun the subsequent mayhem is. Caine and Olivier both milk the intrigue and the drama for all they're worth, one-upping each other with rustic accents and pratfalls, and sparring like two prizefighters over the soliloquies. Both are outstanding although for me Caine pips it, not least because their casting bears no small resemblance to their characters; Olivier was near-gentry (an uncle was a Baron) and lauded with every acting accolade and exclusive status possible, whilst Caine grew up in the East End and earned everything he got the hard way. Olivier is a good sport to play an ageing prima donna with empty boasts of his sexual prowess and he is very funny at times, but Caine's performance is much more natural, richer and thoughtful. It's also a revelation in that just two actors can play a whole movie and it never gets dull or needs any other storytelling devices - Robert Altman and Richard Attenborough take note. The story is so deliciously twisted that there are plenty of opportunities for mugging, but both stars reign it in a bit, with lots of sly little moments like the scene where Milo waits in vain to get a turn in the game of snooker. The other great aspect of the movie is Ken Adam's nutty production design; Andrew's house is a spooky old Victorian folly with a dungeon of a cellar, a hedge maze in the garden and a cavernous living room crammed full of creepy automata whose jerky movements reflect their owner's self-deluded illusion of puppet master. Mankiewicz was an interesting guy who began as a writer in the thirties then moved into production and is best known for directing All About Eve and Cleopatra.

I laughed some, I cried some, and I felt a genuine love for the characters and their struggle. In some ways, I want to say this is the greatest film ever but then I think about it, it's not the greatest film. There is a lot about it that makes it fantastic, some elements have the potential to be The greatest. Here's the thing though it's not the greatest movie I've ever seen, I just can't find anything that I dislike about it. This may not make a whole lot of sense, but think of it this way for a very long time my favorite movie was Pulp Fiction (Tarantino), the raw feeling I got after watching Pulp was so new to me that I couldn't help but stand up and say That was the greatest movie I've ever seen. Immediately my friend disagreed with me, but Pulp just worked for me. I watched Shawshank with this same friend, and we had a discussion about how we felt about it. I didn't feel the raw emotion that I felt after Pulp, he agreed, but I also told him I thought it was excellent, he agreed. What he told me after that was You know, I can see how it's the number 1 movie on IMDb, there's almost nothing to complain about, so there are fewer people who are going to hate it. He was absolutely right, there's just nothing to complain about.Now to the cast Robbins and Freeman play a fantastic duo, (Freeman was a great choice for Red, even though Red is described as Irish, for real, in the novella) and like always Freeman plays his best. I'm not too acquainted with Robbins, but he did everything right, and he made Andy Dufrense a likable, but mysterious and distant character that Dufrense is. Freeman plays Red fantastically, flat out amazing, the nonchalance and joking nature of Red is captured perfectly by Freeman. The rest of the cast does very well, especially James Whitmore, who plays Brooks, the oldest convict in Shawshank State Prison. His role is one of the few in all of history that's brought me to tears.Seeing how there's no action, there's not much to talk about in the effects department, so I'll move on, straight to the story. I have a theory that Stephen King is not a good writer, at least I don't think so, but he is a fantastic storyteller. Shawshank is no different, the plot unfolds well, few details are missed, and the pace is perfect not too fast, not too slow. I think a lot of the credit there goes to Darabont though, he did a fantastic job bringing an often under looked Stephen King novella to life, and I have no complaints on his work.In my opinion there's not a whole lot to say regarding this film, it's fantastic, but you have to watch it to understand why. So, pick this one up, I think this a movie with a broad base, which is very hard to dislike, no matter if you turn your mind off and enjoy (it's still followable) or if you like to think about every detail.

This may not make a whole lot of sense, but think of it this way for a very long time my favorite movie was Pulp Fiction (Tarantino), the raw feeling I got after watching Pulp was so new to me that I couldn't help but stand up and say That was the greatest movie I've ever seen. Immediately my friend disagreed with me, but Pulp just worked for me. I watched Shawshank with this same friend, and we had a discussion about how we felt about it. I didn't feel the raw emotion that I felt after Pulp, he agreed, but I also told him I thought it was excellent, he agreed. What he told me after that was You know, I can see how it's the number 1 movie on IMDb, there's almost nothing to complain about, so there are fewer people who are going to hate it. He was absolutely right, there's just nothing to complain about.Now to the cast Robbins and Freeman play a fantastic duo, (Freeman was a great choice for Red, even though Red is described as Irish, for real, in the novella) and like always Freeman plays his best. I'm not too acquainted with Robbins, but he did everything right, and he made Andy Dufrense a likable, but mysterious and distant character that Dufrense is. Freeman plays Red fantastically, flat out amazing, the nonchalance and joking nature of Red is captured perfectly by Freeman. The rest of the cast does very well, especially James Whitmore, who plays Brooks, the oldest convict in Shawshank State Prison. His role is one of the few in all of history that's brought me to tears.Seeing how there's no action, there's not much to talk about in the effects department, so I'll move on, straight to the story. I have a theory that Stephen King is not a good writer, at least I don't think so, but he is a fantastic storyteller. Shawshank is no different, the plot unfolds well, few details are missed, and the pace is perfect not too fast, not too slow. I think a lot of the credit there goes to Darabont though, he did a fantastic job bringing an often under looked Stephen King novella to life, and I have no complaints on his work.In my opinion there's not a whole lot to say regarding this film, it's fantastic, but you have to watch it to understand why. So, pick this one up, I think this a movie with a broad base, which is very hard to dislike, no matter if you turn your mind off and enjoy (it's still followable) or if you like to think about every detail. I highly recommend it. ","genre":"Crime, Drama"},{"date":"19 July 2010","score":"","review":" I did see this movie in television and liked it. My point is that while in the beginning it strives to be an accurate portrayal of the life style and customs of the early medieval Norsemen and in a lesser degree Arabs the introduction of the human flesh eating Wendols brings an air of unreality in the whole movie. Either you try to be historically accurate or you play on the supernatural element, you can't do both in my opinion at least.On the other hand as the movie progresses the supernatural identity of the human flesh eating Wendols is dispelled and they are revealed as humans dressed in the garments of bears, living in caves, eating human flesh, very primitive but humans nevertheless without any relationship with animalistic or supernatural elements, as the Arab hero played by Antonio Banderas is the first to discover.The problem is that in this otherwise accurate portrayal of 10nth century A.D. world, inhabited by human beings as diverse as cultivated Arabs and rough Norsemen, where do this human flesh eating, bear garment bearing people, the Wendols, sprung from? Of course one could argue that their practices are not so appalling by the standards of the age since we know that during the barbarian invasions and latter during the Crusades, cases of cannibalism have been recorded.As for the sacrifice of human beings to appease a deity, this was massively practiced even latter in history by the Aztecs in Mexico, while widows were cast in the funeral pire of the husbands even in 19nth century British India.Therefore one could argue that the Wendols are not so exceptional by historical standards after all. Still in the movie their existence is rather unexplained and one can say that the differ from both Arabs and Norsemen in a considerable degree.Otherwise there is an effort to present the age in an accurate manner, the costumes and the practices of the heroes to appear in an authentic manner. The relationship of the outsider Arab with the Norsemen is developed in an able manner as well as his gradual integration to their group and his acceptance of their values.The movie is quite frightening and has scenes of violence, battles and human corpses eaten or skeletons exposed. The Wendols are very frightening in the beginning and even latter when their simply human identity is gradually revealed.The development of the characters is fine and some of the Norsemen become from uncouth barbarians human beings of endearing qualities that one can empathize with.
