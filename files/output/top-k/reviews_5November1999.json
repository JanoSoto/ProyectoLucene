However in Smilla she found what could have been the role of a lifetime. I confess I thought maybe Ormond was too beautiful for the role. In the book Smilla more closely resembles the Icelandic singer Bjork. But Ormond is utterly convincing as spiky, cold, somehow deeply and irrevocably hurt Smilla.Unfortunately Ormond is not best served by much of the plot and several of her co-stars. The problem of this film is that it reveals too much. When Smilla is investigating in Copenhagen, meeting various scared and sinister characters, it's fascinating because only snippets of information are given away. In the final stages on the boat and in Greenland, the film loses its way. All the subtly frightening tension that the film has been carefully building is shattered by too much action and melodrama.Some of the characters are also a problem. Gabriel Byrne, who I usually love, is miscast in the role of the nameless mechanic who becomes Smilla's sidekick and love interest. The character is supposed to be enigmatic, but Byrne just seems blank.  The scenes where he and Smilla fall in love are unconvincing, because they are supposed to be two introspective, alienated creatures who slowly break down each others barriers. Perhaps Byrne is too good looking to play this stuttering man who is overwhelmed by intimidation of Smilla.Vanessa Redgrave and Richard Harris are wasted in small roles, and the you feel the relationship between Smilla and her father (Robert Loggia) is not explored well enough as the scenes they do have together are fascinating.The mystery is always more interesting than the discovery, and if the subtlety of the first half had been maintained this would be an almost faultless film. It belongs to Julia Ormond, but another actor has almost the same impact on the film. Clipper Miano as the eight year old victim Isiah is terrific and the flashback scenes revealing the development of the relationship between him and Smilla are mesmerising.

There is indeed some very intense, thought-provoking frosting as the topping, but the plot,as the cake itself, is a soggy mess.\tThe film stars Aidan Quinn in a juicy dual role, playing a United States Naval Officer named Annibal Ramirez, and the antagonist, the mysterious and notorious but impossible to catch terrorist named Carlos. The two characters are from different worlds, but for some reason, they look exactly alike. Therefore, when touring Israel, Annibal is mistaken for Carlos, and is captured, beaten, and confronted by the concealed and powerful Amos (Ben Kingsley), who holds him in contempt for until his followers discover that Annibal isn't who they think he is.\tThis scene triggers the reactions for the rest of the story.  A CIA agent, Henry Fields, (Donald Sutherland) has exerted non-stop efforts to capture and kill Carlos for so many years, it has turned into an obsession for him. Amos works with Fields in efforts to convince Ramirez that he is the only person in the world that can stop the deadly terrorist. But Ramirez is a family man, not interested in leaving his house to become a counter-terrorist. Fields and Amos use varied techniques to persuade Ramirez into buying into the assignment He will go through a series of  training sessions that will allow him to impersonate Carlos. They will then use him to make his sponsors believe that he is traitorous, presumably resulting in his death. \tWhy is Ramirez the only person in the entire world that can stop the villain again? Because they look alike? Why do they share such similarities in appearance? Correct me if I am wrong, but I don't believe the film ever mentioned anything about Ramirez and Carlos being twins separated at birth. Maybe I am the problem, but I was never convinced of why the government was only interested in this one particular man to do their dirty work. The filmmakers spend much precious time on developing Ramirez into a warrior, but such little on the reasoning behind their motives. The characters also spend little time communicating with each other; for once I desired a little subtext in the material, for this movie had such little dialogue, I was starved for a decent conversation.\tThe film's entire first act was so ridiculous it's almost funny. Mainly due to the fact that it isn't convincing, a major factor needed for movies like The Assignment.  It takes a stab blackmail, sorrow, disbelief and family in order to give us a logical explanation of the character's motives. There are several methods director Christian Duguay could have used to portray these people accurately, and he puts forth an honest effort, too bad that none of his ideas work. \tAlthough the film's plot is strong and deep, containing elements of believability and realism, it is also unorganized. Some of the individual scenes on their own are effective, like the sequences featuring Ramirez going through strict training to become an impersonator of Carlos, and where Ramirez is chased through the twisting allies and backdoors of Israel. And there is a relative through-line present. Thus the scenes do relate to each other. So, guess the plot isn't a complete failure.  In general, though, they don't seem to flow very smoothly. \tThere are many great qualities about The Assignment, and many first rate performances as well. The setting development is bold and clear. It provides an accurate and ideal place for these characters to activate in. The development and clearness of the Aidan Quinn character is also right on the money. I have always been a fan of Quinn, and have enjoyed many of his performances throughout his career. However, even he and strong supporting performances by Donald Sutherland, Ben Kingsley, and Céline Bonnier can't save this movie from its overall presentation in an unorderly manor.\tMy deepest apologies go out to you, dead reader ,because due to technical difficulties, I was unable to screen the last thirty minutes of The Assignment, and therefore can't make a complete nor fair judgment on the third act. Add to this the fact that recommending this film is a close call on my part, and that a superb finale may have brought the movie up on my scale the last half star.

During the first 30 minutes I sat stunned in my seat, trying to decide if I should demand a refund. But since I hadn't paid to see it in the first place (passes), I figured I might as well stay.  And I didn't think it could possibly get any worse.It did. I will quickly run through the low points (includes some spoilers) The horrible miscasting of Casper Van Dien as Gillen Lane, a motivational speaker with two PhDs. The characterization was inconsistent; for example, Lane, despite his credentials, is a complete nitwit.  Then there's the lame-o depiction of the fulfillment of the Biblical prophecies; we see a bunch of sensational news soundbites accompanied by ridiculous computer print outs of the translated Biblical Code. Also, terrible action sequences Lane escapes from tough situations without explanation, and the one time Lane actually does seem to be in danger, it turns out to be a dream sequence! That's cute for grammar school writing assignments, but it's an inexcusable plot device in a motion picture. The pacing was bad after a long opener, the first third of the movie changes scenes every 90 seconds.  Later, the pacing improves, but there is still far too much unnecessary jumping around.  And as someone else mentioned, years pass yet no one (not even Lane's young daughter) ages.  That was disconcerting.There are a few good things, though. The quality of the film (e.g. lack of graininess) is high and very attractive.  The outdoor shots were well done and the location shooting added a touch of realism.  Also, there are a few moments in the last part of the film when Lane calls on God (finally) to help him - this proved to be quite exhilarating - even to me, someone who does not accept Jesus as a personal savior. But I liked this because it struck me as being the only genuine scene in the movie. Unfortunately, it was followed by major incomprehensibility.The characters, dialogue, direction and acting were ALL poorly done. Michael Ironside had nothing to do, and Michael York was just weird.  I think the producers wanted to do too much; if the plot had been tighter and more focused, and the characterization more fleshed out, the film would have been far better. In a nutshell, The Omega Code disappoints.  Definitely do not pay to see this.  I give it ** out of ten stars.

I do have a large humanities background.OverviewThis review will be hard to do, since I don't want to reveal anything to you. This is one of those movies where you want to find out everything for yourself, like The Sixth Sense. But I can tell you this is an outstanding masterpiece of the science fiction genre. It will definitely be a classic for a long time.The level of detail is amazing. For example, they went through the entire movie and filtered out a lot of the blue and changed it to green. Blue is too happy of a color they said. All of the sets have extreme levels of detail. It is almost to the point like in one of the Star Trek movies the screws on the Klingon weapons had little Klingon symbols cut out of them to screw them in even though nobody would ever be able to tell. That's the level of detail we are talking about here.The sound is incredible. I got the DVD version and got to listen to it in Dolby Digital Surround sound and it was almost as good as when I saw it at the theaters in THX. If you have a good home theater system then I recommend this DVD to put it through the paces for you. It really shows off the range and power of Dolby Digital Surround sound.Not only are the sets and audio full of great detail but the story is to. The Matrix explains why some people has special powers like being able to lift and move objects with their minds. It also has an explanation for deja vu. There are also little gems stuck in the story itself. See if you notice when Morpheus (the greek god of dreams, see...) asks the traitor to give him his phone, so he can call the operator, how he stalls until someone else gives up their phone instead, because he threw his in the trash. There are lots of these see how many you can find in the first viewing.The movie opens up with a great intense female action scene. You just don't get to see enough women kicking butt these days. The guys always get to have all the fun. But not in this movie. The women can give it out with the best of 'em.I love the special effects. The ship is great. The power plants are great. The sewer city is great. The sentinels are great. The bugs are great. The bug extractor is great. Bullet Time is great. The agents are great. The oracle is great.

It is about us. It is about our will to survive and to make up for and overcome our mistakes. It is about fighting for what is right and to fight the good fight. It is about truth. It is about being real. It is about caring. You will really start to care for this group of rebels.When you take all of the violence, and fancy gadgets, and special effects away from Star Wars, you still have a great story that almost everyone loves.

The plot line is simple Eight men are assigned to find one man whose brothers have all been killed and send him home. The question is, is the lives of eight men worth risking for the life of one? Speilberg, in all of his brilliance, manages to take this simple story and uses it as both an excellent character study and as a vehicle for  graphic depictions of World War II No more is there blood and glory....Just horror and fear. These men who are fighting aren't the fearless war heroes of all the propoganda films of the 40's. On the contrary, they are normal, average men who are afraid and who hate this mission. They aren't just actors...They are you and I in these situations, presenting our humanity and our frailtiess in chaos.This might be the first film to depict World War II in such a way. Of course, it helps that it is backed by an excellent cast (Tom Hanks, Edward Burns, Tom Sizemore, Matt Damon, Ted Danson to name only a few) that knows how to portray each character in memorable ways. But also, this might be the most gruesome of all wars films, not beating around the bush when it comes to the realistic violence that resulted from the war. Limbs are blown off, brains are shot out....The violence is aplenty, but not in a way to glorify it, as many war films do. No, this film uses it to reiterate the original idea War is hell...no, it's worse, and it's not something be glorified. These men sacrificed their lives for us, being no better than us and no worse....And if it was you in the situation, you would have to do the same. Respect that.There's no question about it. This film *should have* won best picture, and it was absolutely robbed. If Shakespeare in Love was one millionth this film, it might have had a chance at competing against it.... How it beat this masterpiece is beyond me....Ignore the foolish academy.
