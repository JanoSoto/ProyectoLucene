I wasn't born yet when the first 3 movies got released to general public but I saw them all multiple times and I always have the same amazement while watching them. They revolutionized the way to do Sci-fi movies and always will be considered as classics.The prequel movies are less captivating my attention even if I like them a lot. The Phantom Menace is the one I like the least.The only purpose of this movie was to introduce us to several Star Wars famous characters Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker, Yoda, Palpatine, R2-D2 and C3-PO. It also adds new characters like Qui-Gon, Padmé Amidala and Jar Jar Binks.This last character was focusing the attention. I don't know what he brings to the story. He is clumsy and all he is doing is messing around and only succeeds to escape a dangerous situation thanks to a great shot of luck. He is technically insignificant and just here for a comic purpose. But it's rather annoying than anything else.Padmé is more interesting to the story. She is reminding Leia. She has the same will to fight rather than surrendering and she is really tougher than she actually looks. We can see it during the final battle on Naboo. So I could feel that she and Anakin would be in a relationship in the next movies.Qui-Gon Jin is an interesting add too as Obi-Wan Kenobi mentor and master. He is bold and wise in the same time, coping with the Jedi way while still trying to keep his independence, which push him to disagree with the order on some matters.But the one character who is particularly underrated is Palpatine. Ian McDiarmid is one genius actor. He already starred as Palpatine in the original trilogy and he kept the essence of the character which is deep evil in a deceptive respectable appearance. That is certainly the best move from George Lucas to cast him again as Palpatine so does his decision to call Anthony Daniels to reprise his role as C3PO.Now as always the story telling is beautifully managed. There is a continued story between the movies and the Phantom Menace acts as a beautiful first chapter. It is visually and orally enjoyable to see. The CGIs help a lot the story and keep us entertained. So it deserves a 7 out of ten because realizing a prequel while we already know in depth the story and then keeping all the suspense away is a hard task. But it still manages to be decent.

This would be enough to please the fans who were anxious to see a glimpse of this epic moment of the Star Wars general history.But what strikes me the most is the very slow pace of the movie. There is some kind of lethargy throughout the movie which never seems to really fade away. The combat scenes are too few to really get us captivated and the lines are clumsy at their best. George Lucas is a great story teller but not much of a director and script writer.The romance between Anakin and Padmé is too predictable and not very powerful and emotional. Yes it's a growing relationship but it's far from being passionate compared to the love story between Han Solo and Leia. And the lines are looking more like coming from some teenage movies than a Star Wars one. That is too bad because there was a great opportunity to exploit.The feud between Obi-Wan and Count Dooku is more remarkable. Christopher Lee's performance as the Evil count is quite good. We don't know if he is a good or bad side until the very end as it is revealed he is a Sith Lord. I would have hoped to see him more often in the movie but his appearance are too much scarce to really exploit the character. But all his scenes are great especially his fight against Yoda which is really enjoyable to see but too short to my taste.I also have to say that I'm quite disturbed by the Clone Army part of the movie. Am I the only one who is finding their first appearance as really abrupt? The movie starts with some attempts to kill Padmé, which are non related to the clone army. The investigation leads Obi-Wan to a small weird planet called Kamino to track down the assassin. But then out of nowhere, the existence of the clone army is suddenly revealed like a cannon ball. Then, despite his surprise, Obi continues his investigation. That is sounding so easy even more when you realize that the CIS is about to launch a massive attack and the Republic has now a huge army to counter it.So I can't give more than a 6 out of 10. The flawed story, the slow pace and the cheesy lines are really discrediting Attack of the Clones which could have been such an awesome movie if more care would have been applied to the script.

The General of 1926 is one of those where its lead actor Buster Keaton seems to communicate with us the viewer via stunts, by also using his stone wall facial expressions but also utilises his surroundings to bring us laughs, but also just a sense of awe in how he does these things. In a day when doing production on a big scale was difficult, The General succeeds in bringing us massive crashes, great little things here and there for Keaton to use to get us to smile and of course a fantastic use of slow moving trains(who knew trains going 10mph could be so fun).I went into watching the movie with high expectations; after all it seems everybody who see's this comes off with a sense of them seeing something amazing. The film for me was maybe not perfect in fact quite a bit from it but I did find the movie to be a great one and coming to that conclusion took me quite a little while. I finished it thinking You know it was good but nothing like what people say about it, but then it came to me the day after seeing this that this is more than good, it is very good and a movie that I really liked. The reason that came to me was Keaton who to me now is the master of doing your own stunts and succeeding, Buster Keaton gets all my praise and he actually makes this rather dull at times plot a hundred times better. So what does that plot have to offer? ,well not an awful lot to be fair although it does give you a few thrills coupled with laughs here and there but never gut busting in my opinion. The story is set in the American civil war of the 19th century, we see Buster Keaton as a train engineer turned down by the Confederacy because he is just too important in what he is doing (but no one bothers to tell him that). Keaton's character of Johnnie Gray has trouble though, Union spies are coming and they plan to steal a train and intend to burn all the bridges back towards their lines. The story of course has much more to that but it really is the kind of movie you just have to watch yourself to see what happens because well for a film like this, a lot happens. Buster Keaton alongside Clyde Bruckman directs this and does a great job yet again, not only is Keaton a fine actor but at directing and even partly the writing too he is just one fine silent movie creator. I think his skills come out most with Bruckman also when he is doing the of course famous stunts he did himself, it is not only the biggest I enjoyed the most though such as the him sitting on the train wheels as they move, just fantastic. When Keaton runs around the train he is fantastic but at times he runs from the end of the carriages to the front and jumps and grabs onto things and just propels himself into the right place, how he never broke his entire body I will never know but the added speed of the movies of the day makes this even more beautiful to see. If you're coming to silent movies as a new viewer or if you consider yourself a connoisseur of the era then both can enjoy this, is it Keaton's best work? , well some will say yes and me myself actually say no for now. What really shows how good Keaton can be is the fact that this movie is considered one of the best silent movies ever and yet could maybe be outdone by some of his other work. That previous point proves to me not only is Keaton one of the finest actors and maybe even directors of the silent's, but also that he could travel forward in time and fit right in with the movies of today.

BA just stares silently, he has to, but his silence gives assent. This is the movie in microcosm; these men are pieces of equipment manipulated in Machiavellian fashion then discarded when they are used up. The scene with Phil getting up in the middle of the night and stretching, every move brings a wince of pain. The other core scene is Phil sitting patiently as BA sits at his computer number crunching Phil's personality with statistics. I love the sardonic smile over at BA that says,Man, are you pathetic. When BA finishes, he pronounces that the numbers prove Elliot's immaturity which is the reason he is hurting the team. This is throughout the movie, these poor jocks are subjected to lectures on how they are failing the coaches statistical expectations like they are human balance sheets who have risen against their accountants. This expose is worth owning; yes, it contains little actual football games but that was never its purpose. It wishes to show you the business that football has become masquerading as a sport.We see drugs used to get out of contracts on players who are used up like Phil. Elliot challenges who is smoking the joint with him; a hush falls over the room, if you think they will say Seth, their star quarterback, forget about it. The callous manipulation of Delmar by the sanctimonious BA by lying to Elliot and telling him he's going to start to get Delmar to dope up his knee, like they want. During the big game, Delmar tears it all up and gets carted off. If you are looking for a pure sports movie, Hoosiers is more like that. This is a trenchant look inside the world of football. It has lots of great, quite vulgar humor. Joe Bob steals the movie with his buddy O.W. Phil says,Oh, Joe Bob's Fine Foods, eat here or I'll kill you. The other players hold Joe Bob back from launching Phil into orbit. The movie is not perfect; Mac Davis had a very popular TV variety show when this came out. They put him in here and Nolte holds him up, acting wise, as best he can. Yet, his acting is painful, some lines just fall flat. He only made one other major movie, the bomb Sting 2, after that he disappeared.The romance slows the movie way, way down. Dayle Haddon, while stunningly beautiful, was a dreadful actress. She only reappeared in Van Damme's bomb Cyborg. She does have that good scene where she gets up and sees how crippled he is while he is stretching but the majority of the scenes serve no purpose and slow down the narrative. Yet, it is worth owning, as an expose on sports it is without equal. I love The Natural but that is more a deeply allegorical morality movie. Parents be warned, only DePalma's Scarface has worse language and vulgarities inside of it than this movie. Some of them I am still working on, evidently Joe Bob's mom is a teacher but he is very sensitive about it. I will not lie to you, yes, I am a Theistic Existentialist, but I laughed my butt off. Joe Bob is hilariously out of control; he is like the world's most dangerous toddler. Within the deep laughter is a great movie about the cruelty inflicted upon these athletes.

The other players hold Joe Bob back from launching Phil into orbit. The movie is not perfect; Mac Davis had a very popular TV variety show when this came out. They put him in here and Nolte holds him up, acting wise, as best he can. Yet, his acting is painful, some lines just fall flat. He only made one other major movie, the bomb Sting 2, after that he disappeared.The romance slows the movie way, way down. Dayle Haddon, while stunningly beautiful, was a dreadful actress. She only reappeared in Van Damme's bomb Cyborg. She does have that good scene where she gets up and sees how crippled he is while he is stretching but the majority of the scenes serve no purpose and slow down the narrative. Yet, it is worth owning, as an expose on sports it is without equal. I love The Natural but that is more a deeply allegorical morality movie. Parents be warned, only DePalma's Scarface has worse language and vulgarities inside of it than this movie. Some of them I am still working on, evidently Joe Bob's mom is a teacher but he is very sensitive about it. I will not lie to you, yes, I am a Theistic Existentialist, but I laughed my butt off. Joe Bob is hilariously out of control; he is like the world's most dangerous toddler. Within the deep laughter is a great movie about the cruelty inflicted upon these athletes. If you vote to this to the back, I wouldn't tell Joe Bob. An Excellent Movie.

The script by John Briley is beautifully written and full of marvellous dialogue while Richard Attenborough's direction is never less than fantastic. This was Attenborough's dream project and I am delighted that it was such a success, winning him both Best Picture and Best Director. It was the only time that one of his directorial efforts was nominated for either award.As strong as the writing and direction are, the film would not have been nearly as successful had it not been for the casting of Ben Kingsley in the title role. A comparative unknown before the film was released, he plays Gandhi between the ages of 23 and 78 and is never less than mesmerising in the demanding role. Over the course of the film's more than three hour running time, he goes from being an inexperienced young lawyer with no idea of how to handle people to the one of the most revered and respected men in the world. Gandhi is depicted a man of great integrity, humility, courage, compassion, wisdom and intelligence. The strength of Kingsley's performance, which deservedly won Best Actor, means that the audience never doubts why so many Indian people follow him. I suspect that this would be the case even for the admittedly few people who didn't know who Gandhi was before watching the film. However, the script also humanises him when it shows his anger at his wife Kasturba's refusal to clean the latrines in the ashram in South Africa and, decades later, when she tells Margaret Bourke-White that he neglected her in favour of his activism, albeit not in so many words. This behaviour is not exactly admirable but it is very human and I think that the film needed that human dimension to ground its portrayal of Gandhi.In its depiction of South Africa and the British Raj, the film does not pull any punches when it comes to the institutionalised racism that existed in both states. One of the most powerful scenes in the film is the deeply moving and disturbing recreation of the Amritsar massacre of 1919 in which as many of 1,000 men, women and children were killed in the space of barely ten minutes. It is a great illustration of Attenborough's skill as a director. The massacre was easily the worst and most infamous atrocity ever perpetrated by the British Army and is generally considered to be one of the major events which paved the way for Indian independence. One thing that is not depicted in the film is that many in Britain hailed its chief perpetrator General Reginald Dyer and felt that it was necessary to maintain discipline. However, the majority of the British people saw it for what it was, namely mass murder, and Dyer was forced to retire soon afterwards.That said, I think that Gandhi was correct in describing Dyer as an extreme example of the racism which existed towards the Indian people on the part of the British administration, though this is a criticism that could be just as fairly levelled against every colonial power of the day. In spite of such acts of extreme violence, however, Gandhi continually relies on non-violent resistance to obstruct and even shame the administration. While some of his followers suggest the use of violence to achieve their aims, he is appalled by the idea. Jinnah says that he would rather be ruled by an Indian terrorist than an English one when Gandhi and Nehru point out that an Indian campaign of violence would leave them with deeply unsuitable leaders, to put it mildly, if and when India became independent. Unfortunately, this is a lesson which people in many other countries have failed to grasp. Speaking of Jinnah, his extremely unfair depiction as a sneering, sometimes even frightening, villainous figure is certainly the largest historical accuracy in the film. In this respect, I think that the filmmakers knew what side their bread was buttered on as a third of the budget was provided by the Indian government, then led by Nehru's daughter Indira Gandhi, through the National Film Development Corporation of India.As he always did, Attenborough was able to assemble an excellent cast in roles of varying size Rohini Hattangadi as Kasturba Gandhi, Roshan Seth as Nehru, Saeed Jaffrey as Sardar Patel, Alyque Padamsee as Jinnah (I can't fault his performance, even if the character is not depicted accurately), Ian Charleson as Charlie Andrews, Candice Bergen as Margaret Bourke-White, John Mills as Lord Chelmsford, John Gielgud as Lord Irwin (better remembered as Lord Halifax, who had a left hand in the film but not in reality), Martin Sheen as Vince Walker (the only notable fictional character), Edward Fox as General Dyer, Trevor Howard as Lord Broomfield, Athol Fugard as General Smuts, Günther Maria Halmer as Dr. Hermann Kallenbach (who doesn't seem to age in 50 years!) and Geraldine James as Mirabehn (who died only four months before the film was released). It was features great appearances in smaller roles from Michael Hordern, Richard Vernon, John Savident, a very young Daniel Day-Lewis, the director's brother-in-law Gerald Sim, Amrish Puri, Terence Hardiman, Nigel Hawthorne, Richard Griffiths, Bernard Hill, Ian Bannen and Shane Rimmer. Attenborough had such a great eye for casting.Overall, this is a wonderful epic film which deservedly swept the boards at the Oscars in 1983. While it is not my favourite Attenborough film since I preferred both Oh! What a Lovely War and A Bridge Too Far, it is one of my favourite biopics and historical films. A triumph for all concerned.

In addition, if you're not able to take the best slasher classic horror film in the genre, ignore this review, as well. We'll both be better off.I am written this review In Memorie of my all time favorite the best horror director Wes Craven that sadly is no longer with us anymore. On August 30th 2015, Craven died of brain cancer at home in Los Angeles. I am doing this for him. A Nightmare on Elm Street is a 1984 American supernatural Classic slasher horror film written and directed by Wes Craven, and the first film of the Nightmare on Elm Street franchise The best horror flick I have ever seen.I love this film to death, I love it!!! I love some other films of Wes Craven that he directed like are New Nightmare, Scream, Shocker,The People Under the Stairs, Scream 2 and Scream 3. A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) for me will be always in the genre the best slasher classic horror film written and directed by Wes Craven. He gave us Freddy Krueger which was followed six sequels one crossover and one remake after success of the first film that gross $26.505.000 in USA. The sequel after the first film A Nightmare on Elm Street Part 2 Freddy's Revenge was refused from Wes Craven to work on the film because he never wanted or intended A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) to become an ongoing franchise (and even wanted the first film to have a happy ending), and also because he didn't like the idea of Freddy manipulating the protagonist into committing the murders. The sequel for me wasn't a good movie after the original was released. My top 5 films of We Craven would be A Nightmare On Elm Street, Scream , New Nightmare, Shocker and The People Under the Stairs. The first film is so original, realistic, and overall terrifying horror classic slasher flick that is actually happening in dreams, a sociopath child killer with sharp clawed glove who has knives in stead for a fingers, can enter into your dreams. If he kills you in your dreams, you're dead for real. The main protagonist is Nancy Thompson a teenager where her friends start dying and are killed one by one from Freddy Krueger, she try's to warn people from Freddy coming in to their dreams, but no one listens to her not her father the Sheriff not her mom or her friends. Her parents hold a dark secret from her long ago. She is alone in this and she has to fight him by her self by going back in to her dreams and get Freddy out of her dream in to the real world. Nancy the character was so clever, smart and intense carefully. She was awesome unique legendary heroine did you see how she put booby-traps for Freddy? Awesome!Tina Grey played by Amanda Wyss, is really good in her role for the short time she is in this film. Heather Langenkamp is excellent in her role as the main protagonist in this film. She's legendary unique teen heroine a very attractive,and gives 100% as Tina's friend Nancy Thompson who starts to have the same nightmares. Robert Englund as Freddy Krueger the actor's contribution to the character is 100% superb. I think that Freddy Kruegar IS Robert Englund and vice versa, even though a lot of his moments in this film are about injecting a scary visual presence, he also creates a mystic before the film's revelation Who is he? Where does he come from? Why is he doing these things? After the third film of the series, Englund would become a Hollywood star and a horror icon. For me Robert Englund will be the only Freddy Krueger I love him in all Nightmare films. John Saxon as Lt. Donald Thompson, Nancy's dad was fantastic in his role and his performance. Johnny Depp in his first role as Glen Lantz was awesome, I seriously loved him in 21 Jump Street TV Series and today I still love him in Pirates of the Caribbean film franchise. I love the main theme Nightmare Freddy Krueger score from Charles Bernstein and I love the song at the of the credits Nightmare by 213.A Nightmare On Elm Street (1984) is the best classic slasher film,one of the best horror movies ever made.

I love this movie death. 10\/10 Grade Bad Ass Seal Of Approval Studio New Line Cinema Starring Heather Langenkamp, Robert Englund, Johnny Depp, John Saxon, Nick Corri, Amanda Wyss, Ronee Blakley Director Wes Craven Producer Robert Shaye Writer Wes Craven Rated R Running Time 1 Hr. 31 Mins.

It's a raging typhoon, one part family high drama, one part war film, wrapped in a nostalgic, old world romance that hearkens back to the golden age of cinema. It's an epic as only the pictures can show us, blowing a gust of storytelling wind at us and depositing us on the endless plains of the 1900's, in the monumental Rocky Mountains of Montana. The story focuses on Colonel William Ludlow (Anthony Hopkins, gnarled nobility incarnate), living with his three sons in the desolation of an old world making way for a new, as the four of them deal with love, loss, war, nature and interpersonal conflict in a story that plumbs the chasms of human nature and spits out characters that bleed raw feeling, reach out to one another in the clamour of a nation only just being formed (like the land itself), and clash in tragic harmony, spanning years in their lives and showing us desperation, grief and brotherhood. Brad Pitt, in the fiercest performance I've ever seen him muster, plays Tristan, Ludlow's half Native son with a wild streak a mile long and a kinship with the tangled wilderness he calls home. Aiden Quinn plays the middle brother Alfred, a reserved, analytical type. When their younger brother Samuel (Henry Thomas), arrives home with his beautiful fiancé Susannah (Julia Ormond) sparks fly between her and Tristan, and an immediate rift is formed in the family that Ormond sees all too well, but cannot deny her love for Pitt. Samuel is a fragile, easily traumatized man, and when the boys are driven from their lands to fight in the war, it dampens his soul with a ruining force of horror that leaves him scarred forever. Tristan, being almost animalistic at heart, sinks into the carnage of combat with the keen resilience of a wolf, and is transformed in a different fashion. This to me is the penultimate sequence of the film, as it strays from the picturesque grandeur of their life before, removed from the world of conflict, into the sheer reality that befalls a country in formation, representing a loss of innocence so to speak. Neither of them are the same after that, and the cracks in their brotherhood only etch further after tragedy befalls Susannah, blackening their idealistic home life as well and tainting the memory with aching sadness. Tristan tries to move on, either to wrap the hurt in a cloak of new events, or because his instinctual nature spurs him on, but he almost seems to be cursed, and more hardships step into his path as well. I don't want to deter you from seeing this by laying all this doom and gloom into my review, because it's actually a very beautiful film to see unfolding, it just deals with incredibly tragic subject matter that will leave you breathless with tears, like Titanic, or Romeo & Juliet. Pitt.. What can I say. He's outstanding, giving Tristan the fearsome gaze of a wounded animal, and the love struck longing that's shot down by fate, turning him into a prisoner of his own ephemeral love for those who are taken from him. It's my second favourite of his roles (it's hard to top Twelve Monkeys) and he shines in it like a silver star over the Montana horizon. Montana itself basically screams to be pored over by a camera, and the cinematography will make you feel every gust of mountain air and gasp at the looming crags and sun dappled glades that leap out from your screen at you. It's one of the last of a dying breed the romantic epic. Like Titanic, or Gone With The Wind and Doctor Zhievago before it, it posses that untouchably bold quality that showcases emotion, tragic happenstance and deep longing all set in a breathtaking setting that is meant to move and astonish you.

At approximately 3 and a half hours long, Das Boot comes across as just one long trip with a German U-Boat crew. At surface level, it is.

He is forced to bring in his estranged daughter Amanda, the ace pitcher, and recruit the local juvenile delinquent played by a very young Watchman's Earle Haley. The film deepens as he molds them together, though realistically, tensions never quite disappear. The scene where Amanda tries pushing him to go out on a date with his ex plus Amanda gets quite ugly verbally. Now we understand two things why she wished to be on the team and why he drinks. Why this endures plays out as Buttermaker beholds the villain of the movie played by Vic Morrow who drives his poor charges with a whip and a chair. There is a hilarious speech where Morrow acts like if they lose this game the earth's magnetic field will reverse polarity. This, with the brave unconventional ending, is why this is a classic and the sequels disappeared like lightning. It is not phony, Buttermaker gets caught up in winning and begins to turn into Vic Morrow. His team starts looking at him differently and I don't mean positively.The epiphany comes when Morrow's son, the pitcher, tries to bean his chubby nemesis on the Bears. Morrow comes up and slaps him hard, publicly, in a scene that never could have been shot today. The kid bravely holds the ball, on the next play, allowing all the Bears' runners to score. He then walks over and drops the ball contemptuously in front of Morrow and walks away with his mom. This experience changes Buttermaker, the camera zooms on his face, he pulls all the starters out and puts the bench in. Oglethorpe, the dreadful pitcher, warns him,Don't put me in, I stink! The parents have a baby; the director toys with you, allows you to think they might pull it off but realistically they lose. He tops it off by giving them all beers. The essence of its success is where Lupus, the worst, smallest player, catches an outfield fly ball. He learns, after witnessing the cruelty of Morrow, to see the children inside of these uniforms. He chooses them over fulfilling the parents' need for reflective glory drawn from their children.This is why even if you don't love baseball, like I do, you should watch the movie.

Within the profanity, there is a beautiful movie about a lost, depressed man estranged from his family coming back by helping these kids. The quintessence of the movie is when he existentially turns from becoming another Vic Morrow to caring for the children in the uniforms. He sees their souls not the trophy. It lives on because beneath the baseball it has a deeply moral base. Yes, parents, the language and the drinking are problematic for little ones. Teenagers would be a better audience.

I was floored by its benign, lighthearted first third, which gives way to some unexpectedly deep social commentary, brought to life bu truly remarkable performances, and stunning, storybook cinematography that looks like Sin City had a baby with Rumble Fish. Tobey Maguire, an actor I usually can't stand, is nicely low key, while his sister Reese Witherspoon gets the peppy, in your face persona. Following a terse bit of sibling rivalry, a strange TV repairman shows up, bestowing on them an ancient looking replacement remote. Before they can ask where he even came from, they are magically whisked from their 1990's living room right into TV land, specifically a cheery black and white 1950's sitcom called Pleasentville. They find themselves in a gosh golly, apple pie, white picket fence realm of perky, smiling housewives, rampant celibacy (the characters in this town are essentially shells of humans, and have no idea what sex is...yet;). The naive, mentally stunted townsfolk function at the truncated level that the show's writing is allowed, resulting in strangely robotic, stepford wives like versions of people. That all changes however, when Witherspoon introduces a highschool hunk (Paul Walker, hilarious) to the ol' hanky panky. From there on in the townspeople gradually discover books, music, art, and as such start to see the world in vibrant colors, and become colored themselves. It's a genius idea for a film that's executed perfectly, with some scenarios that really pay off, making you feel and think. J.T. Walsh, always fantastic, plays the town's fearful skeptic of a mayor. William H. Macy nails the father role perfectly (Where's my dinner?!), Joan Allen gives the best work I've ever seen her do, giving force and gentle feeling to the wife who starts exploring herself, and the world around her. The crown jewel acting wise though is Jeff Daniels, as an aloof diner owner who discovers an affinity for the arts. He brings such a warmth and budding humanity to the role. There's subtext relating to Mccarthy-ism, and not letting the powers that be tell how you what to like, how to feel or what to do. There's a lot to enjoy in this package, and indeed all aspects are done so well its a wonder this one hasn't retained acclaim over the years.

I was floored by its benign, lighthearted first third, which gives way to some unexpectedly deep social commentary, brought to life bu truly remarkable performances, and stunning, storybook cinematography that looks like Sin City had a baby with Rumble Fish. Tobey Maguire, an actor I usually can't stand, is nicely low key, while his sister Reese Witherspoon gets the peppy, in your face persona. Following a terse bit of sibling rivalry, a strange TV repairman shows up, bestowing on them an ancient looking replacement remote. Before they can ask where he even came from, they are magically whisked from their 1990's living room right into TV land, specifically a cheery black and white 1950's sitcom called Pleasentville. They find themselves in a gosh golly, apple pie, white picket fence realm of perky, smiling housewives, rampant celibacy (the characters in this town are essentially shells of humans, and have no idea what sex is...yet;). The naive, mentally stunted townsfolk function at the truncated level that the show's writing is allowed, resulting in strangely robotic, stepford wives like versions of people.

Unfortunately I consider DIVA is a case of former, not just because the source material, Delacorta's novel, is firmly grounded in its entangled involvements of two tapes, an intrepid postman Jules (Andréi) who is a fervid opera fan of singer Cynthia Hawkins (Fernandez), a drug cartel and prostitution ring in Paris, the inept police department, a Taiwanese gang who deals with pirate tapes and a mysterious man Serge Gorodish (Bohringer) with his young Vietnamese lover Alba (Luu), who phlegmatically keeps the upper hand of the dangerous game.

Living in a huge apartment with an eye-opening parade of post-pop art, one might want to watch an entire movie solely based on his exotic way of life with Alba.Equipped with a neon-lit pizazz, its fixation on opera and female nudity, all I can say is that DIVA deserves to be a niche in a time capsule for epitomising the zeitgeist of its time, when most of us have no mood to revisit, in spite of being obtrusively garish and full of far- fetched whims in its vein.

She decides to relax, perhaps read a book, take things easy while her family is not there to keep her busy round the clock. But, things change when a photographer drives into town. One Robert Kincaid (Clint Eastwood).As much as I don't like this movie, I must at least admire what Eastwood has managed to achieve with it as its director, given the source material, which is basically just housewife literature, in the most derogatory meaning of the term. But with Eastwood at its helm, it transforms into something almost bearable. It is unhurried, yet never slow. The characters feel like actual three-dimensional people, and not just props meant to fuel our fantasies. The sets are nice, the dialogues feel natural and if only the story had even the slightest bit of substance, this could have been something. Plus both Eastwood and Streep are phenomenal actors.Alas, the story is garbage. I can see Eastwood trying to tell something about the loneliness of house wives, or the loneliness of a traveler. You can see his attempt to build passion where in the book there's only lust. But, the fact remains, that this is simply a movie about an affair. The movie tries to hang bells and other assorted decorations to hide the fact, but it fails. And it's dull to boot.

But with Eastwood at its helm, it transforms into something almost bearable. It is unhurried, yet never slow. The characters feel like actual three-dimensional people, and not just props meant to fuel our fantasies. The sets are nice, the dialogues feel natural and if only the story had even the slightest bit of substance, this could have been something. Plus both Eastwood and Streep are phenomenal actors.Alas, the story is garbage. I can see Eastwood trying to tell something about the loneliness of house wives, or the loneliness of a traveler. You can see his attempt to build passion where in the book there's only lust. But, the fact remains, that this is simply a movie about an affair. The movie tries to hang bells and other assorted decorations to hide the fact, but it fails. And it's dull to boot.

","genre":"Drama, Romance"},{"date":"13 September 2015","score":"","review":" After finally watching Reservoir Dogs twice, I can definitely say that this is near the top of my Tarantino movie list (with all of his other movies). This man is an absolute genius. Armed with just $1.2 million, Quentin Tarantino is able to provide a movie that has it all. A clever, mind bending story, compelling characters, and even an exceptional soundtrack. All of this in his first movie! Despite how simple the story may sound on the surface, Reservoir Dogs takes a big left turn when it decides to make one of the men an undercover cop. It is then left up to the viewer to decide who the Rat is. Tarantino's decision to include a Rat adds an element of mystery that keeps the viewer engaged throughout the whole movie. However, where Reservoir Dogs really shines is with its characters. 4 of the 6 men are given such vibrant personalities that it not only makes them entertaining character, but it also helps make each one of the characters a plausible choice to be the Rat. The nonlinear storyline also works great in the film as it provides back-story in a way that coincides well with what is happening in the main plot. The hiccups Reservoir Dogs suffers from is a couple of awkward moments in the dialogue. However, Tarantino was able to show in his future films that he is fully capable of delivering spot on dialogue. Overall Reservoir Dogs is what you would expect from Quentin Tarantino. Over the top violence, profanity, and characters that all work great together. Quentin Tarantino has done it again!!!!

He is trying to drive the ocean back with his cane cursing and ordering it. This is the quintessential metaphor of existential Bad Faith trying to create permanency in the midst of transiency. He orders the waves which are a temporal metaphor backwards. Yes, he is insane but when you understand the entire movie you will see Sheridan's simile here. The whole project to perpetuate himself through that silly, little piece of land that is what this means. Jamie's ghost haunts the movie, Tadgh's eldest brother who committed suicide to escape existentially from this tyrants's domination. Bad Faith is an existential term that Sartre uses to refer to people who wish to lose themselves in their roles forgetting the ontological distance, always present, between the role and their being in the world. This gap, or nothingness, is where human freedom exists. Bull tells us this in that scene with the Yank and the priest. He recounts how he earned his father's admiration by leaving that corpse, dead in the field, so they could finish working on the land. He shows us why Jamie killed himself, he begins trying to find Tadgh a wife, behind his back, like you would a prized bull.Tadgh, until the very end, has not the heart to explain to this land lusting lunatic that he does not want the life Bull has already ordained for him. Bull orders this tiny village all about, bullying and even drowning the tinker's mule for daring to come onto his prized piece of rented land. When the Yank dares trying to buy it, Bull beats his head in and throws him in the bay. Sheridan speaks through the priest,What would you do to others to get this piece of land. Would you murder? Yes, it is about greed but much more. Bull is elderly and facing approaching death. He tries to perpetuate himself and cheat death by using Tadgh, like his father, to live forever. When Bull talks about the land, listen for the trans-generational language this is the existential failed project of Bad Faith. He wishes to lose his transient body within the land. He then needs Tadge, like dead Jamie, to be a slave to the land and repeat this process, with his children, ad infinitum. Poor Tadgh and Bird have to suffer through interminable lectures on their duty to this stupid piece of dirt. Why should you care? It goes beyond being anti-greed; the movie teaches you the insanity that is materialism quite well. The attempt to run away from death and one's existential transiency into material permanency. I love The Boxer, even though I hate both boxing and romance, but this is Sheridan's best film. Bull kills Tadgh, inadvertently, by stampeding the animals over him and they both fly off the cliff. If you wish to escape from the insane asylum that is consumerism, you could not watch a better movie. More than that, it teaches a old man's tragic quest to leap over death through his son's slavery to a piece of dirt. Harris never gave a better performance; I loved Wrestling Earnest Hemingway but this dwarfs it. One stopped heartbeat and it all belongs to another; Bull attempts to circumvent this by enslaving his village and his family to help him live forever through the land. A very dark tragedy, you will not be whistling after you finish watching it. It has great lessons to teach. One of the best depictions of the philosopher Jean Paul Sartre's concept of Bad Faith. One Powerful Movie.
