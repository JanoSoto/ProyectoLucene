The US government is already trying to implement biological modes of identification besides simply having you give your fingerprint at the DPS station to renew your driver's license. In all actuality, it's fairly feasible, even scary. Although the film takes place in the not so distant future, it's more like 1984.Tom Cruise is a hit or miss for me, sometimes he's enjoyable and sometimes I want to crush his head in a vise. It always seems to be a toss up, but he does a decent job here. Colin Farrell outshines him though as the investigator of Pre-Crime who's trying to dig up dirt on Cruise's character, although his role is minimal. You really do hate him at first because of his character, which is a good sign that he did a nice job...even if he reminds you of a gibbon monkey or a man in a Gillette Mach 3 commercial. Let's just pray suspenders aren't around in the future. Overall a very entertaining film from Spielberg with some excellent action sequences and a few decent twists. But since it is Spielberg, you always know how the film will end. Nice and pretty, everything's fine and you get breakfast in bed while winning the lottery. If he didn't always end films the same way, it might make his movies more enjoyable as you wouldn't be able to predict what type of ending they'd have. That said though, extremely entertaining but could have used a less goody two shoes ending...still a grade A sci-fi film.

Might as well be Oliver Stone. Given the subject matter, Stone was able to go off the deep end with his imagery here to the point of making one have an epileptic seizure OR think they just dropped some acid. Either way, it's great to watch in my book.The film is flawed in that it's not titled correctly. It's not about The Doors, it's about Jim Morrison and basically just the wild and crazy side of him. That's ok I guess, Morrison was The Doors. Many have criticized Stone for not depicting Jim in the proper light, but given how many people knew him it had to be an almost impossible task to please everyone as everyone knew him differently. I think we all can attest to this through the friendships we have with our friends. Some know us as one way, and some know us as another. I respect Stone for trying and feel sorry for him about the flak people have given him as I know he is a very talented director. I think his intentions were spawned out of true admiration and that he made this film for himself and to pay tribute, and not to win any awards. More of this can be found on the Special Edition DVD from Stone himself.Even if one does not enjoy the trippy qualities of the film such as I do, or any part for that matter, one could not avoid admitting how well Val Kilmer portrays Morrison. It's simply amazing and is one of the best performances that I can bring to mind, and is the best example of how to literally become someone else, bar none. He doesn't act like he's Jim Morrison, he becomes Jim Morrison. He is Jim Morrison. This is no doubt helped by the uncanny facial similarities the two have. Not only that, most of the singing that's in the film was done by Kilmer himself and even a few of the original band members admitted that they honestly could not tell the difference between their two voices. Even if you hate Val Kilmer, this performance jumps in your face and screams for respect while trying to strangle you.As mentioned earlier, some do not like the film for several reasons. One is that it makes Jim look like a monster and that it only glorifies his wild and uninhibited behavior. Two is that it's basically just one big acid trip into bits of history about the band. For one, Oliver Stone said it best....when you have to condense a person's life, a legend at that, into two measly hours you must take the highlights. Everyone lives longer than two hours, even Jim. We all know Jim was crazy, and with so many of the insane stories Stone heard while trying to piece together the script for this, a lot of what he heard was simply what you see. The wild and crazy side. As a result, what we're left with is not an accurate depiction of The Doors or of Jim Morrison. It is entertaining, yes, but it is not accurate. I think it could have been done perfectly, but it would have been excruciatingly difficult...and still not everyone would like it. And as far as the trippiness of the film, well that's Oliver Stone for you. We saw the same thing in Natural Born Killers a few years later. I personally like the style of it and felt that it was in place here but that's just my opinion. The '60's, drugs, and rock and roll equals trippy.Overall a decent attempt at one of the most difficult subjects to cover, legends. And even though it's not entirely accurate and even though Morrison is one of my idols and he deserved a little better, I do enjoy the film greatly. The film should have been named Pandora's Box.

Casino is a masterpiece of a mob film from Martin Scorsese, and in my opinion better than the well received Goodfellas...and I don't know if I could tell you why, that's just the way I feel. There are many obvious similarities since they're both created by Scorsese, both have DeNiro and Pesci, and in both the s*** hits the fan in the end. They are frequently compared in reviews so I'll say, for the record, that I enjoy Casino much more. I think most of the reason Goodfellas is rated higher is because it came out first and some people see Casino as a rehash. I do not care about that myself, they're both great films.I've seen this film over a dozen times and it still has yet to get old. It's filmed beautifully and the music seems to fit the time periods and helps to establish the overall environment of it all, as it should. DeNiro and Pesci were conceived by God himself to play their parts in films like these and are always a joy to watch. Sharon Stone as Ginger is a definite standout. I honestly didn't know she could act until she was in this movie. She portrays the drug addicted ex-call girl turned wife of Sam Rothstein, the mob friendly casino boss. The film is quite violent and some denounce it for  being gratuitous as if the mob goes by the same standard. It's just a movie and if you enjoy watching films in the same genre, then it shouldn't be too much to handle. The language is also fairly harsh, mostly from Nicky (Pesci), but it helps give it a gangster feel. Plus, it doesn't help that there's so much voice over in the film, which is were a lot of the profanity comes from. That's just how mob guys talk, come on now. Didn't you know? All of the wise guys that I know do the same. Even though many consider voice overs a cop-out in filmmaking, I honestly can't imagine the movie any other way. It definitely works and at least it's not Ray Liotta's voice.As previously mentioned, the cinematography is beautiful, all that panning and sweeping...love it, and it works. I particularly enjoy the opening sequence in which the operations of the casino are explained.......also the intro to the meeting in the desert where the camera focuses on Sam's sunglasses as Nicky drives madly across in the reflection, stirring up a storm of sand. Simple, but great. Even more interesting are the true parts of the story. I did some research and the film does mix and match some things around, but for the most part it is true. In actuality, the true story was much crazier and it involved the skimming of four casinos, not just one, one of which was the Stardust....all were ran by the real Sam Rothstein, Frank Lefty Rosenthal. And yes, the character that is supposed to be Nicky (Tony The Ant) really did do what he did in the movie with a vise. The fact that it's based on a true story does make it a little more enjoyable to me, especially since it's pretty damn close.What it all boils down to is one of my favorite films that I've seen, and one of the best mob movies ever...just like Goodfellas. I think most just don't give it a fair chance. Had Casino been released first, I think it very well could replace GF in the Top 250.

And since Kurtz is one of the most decorated men in the armed forces, it is hard for Capt. Willard to understand how Col. Kurtz could go off the deep end as he has, killing without clearance and taking the war into his own hands. What possibly could have pushed this great man over the top? Through Willard's long journey through the jungle to find his target, he tries with some success to understand why. But what will he decide to do once he finds him?Any movie that can start out with The Doors' The End is a great movie in my book, especially if it can flow with the mood and imagery shown with the song. Apocalypse Now does this perfectly. I can't think of anything better for it to be set to, the Vietnam War and the insanity in the soliders' minds that it created. AN is a dark and brutal story about a long journey through some of the hairiest jungle in Vietnam, the ultimate destination of which is murder. Through it's use of music and score alone, we are thrown into a dark world of mystery, violence, and insanity. A perfect example of how to set mood through music alone is this film right here.    An overall great cast, with the exception of Laurence Fishburne, of which Sheen and Brando give us more than enough acting skills to spread around on our movie desire bread. I just don't like Fishburne, ever since I found out he was Cowboy Curtis in PeeWee's playhouse my contempt and hatred for this man has increased ten fold. I realize the pettiness of this but I simply do not care. We need to sick Gary Oldman on him. Brando is excellent as Col. Kurtz and I can't think of any other actor that could have played the good man gone insane and hold such screen presence. Sheen is also fun to watch as Willard and we can identify with his questioning of his mission and the war in general. My favorite character in the movie has to be Robert Duvall's Lt. Colonel Kilgore. Before this film I never pictured Duvall as a wartime cowboy but honestly it's my favorite of his parts to date. He simply nailed his character, which is one of the best in the entire film, as the gung-ho Air Cavalry commander who loves to surf. Maybe a little over the top but still brilliant. I also love the smell of napalm in the morning.The plot is a fairly simple one and it doesn't take too much brainpower to figure out what's going on. Willard's mission is to kill Kurtz, plain and simple. But it's the journey of the film that is really it's heart and also the dire situations of war itself. In the Redux version we are forced to sit through the extended French plantation scene and the Playboy bunny scene which really adds nothing to the film's entirety other than it makes it a longer journey. I don't feel they take away anything though, it's just a matter of if you want to watch a three and a half hour movie or the original. Through this journey, the film points out the utter futility and irrelevance of the war to the Americans and the massive effect it had on the soldiers who fought in it...in fact, that's the entire point. On top of that, the troops were not supported by the public and that could very well have helped cause a character like Kurtz' to go completely mad.  A big war movie lover, this one is up there with Platoon and The Deer Hunter, all of them classics. I sometimes try to compare films of the same genre to one another but it has gotten me in trouble in the past in my reviews as I have had to go back on what I've said. All three have their own strengths and add their own twist to the Vietnam War....so to really say one is better than the other is fairly pointless...even if after having most recently view AN I think it's a tad better. In the end, Apocalypse Now is a true classic in either version and worthy of the status it's been given. As a fellow reviewer has previously stated, AN is one of the most ambitious films ever made.

I also love the smell of napalm in the morning.The plot is a fairly simple one and it doesn't take too much brainpower to figure out what's going on. Willard's mission is to kill Kurtz, plain and simple. But it's the journey of the film that is really it's heart and also the dire situations of war itself. In the Redux version we are forced to sit through the extended French plantation scene and the Playboy bunny scene which really adds nothing to the film's entirety other than it makes it a longer journey. I don't feel they take away anything though, it's just a matter of if you want to watch a three and a half hour movie or the original. Through this journey, the film points out the utter futility and irrelevance of the war to the Americans and the massive effect it had on the soldiers who fought in it...in fact, that's the entire point. On top of that, the troops were not supported by the public and that could very well have helped cause a character like Kurtz' to go completely mad.  A big war movie lover, this one is up there with Platoon and The Deer Hunter, all of them classics. I sometimes try to compare films of the same genre to one another but it has gotten me in trouble in the past in my reviews as I have had to go back on what I've said.

And since Kurtz is one of the most decorated men in the armed forces, it is hard for Capt. Willard to understand how Col. Kurtz could go off the deep end as he has, killing without clearance and taking the war into his own hands. What possibly could have pushed this great man over the top? Through Willard's long journey through the jungle to find his target, he tries with some success to understand why. But what will he decide to do once he finds him?Any movie that can start out with The Doors' The End is a great movie in my book, especially if it can flow with the mood and imagery shown with the song. Apocalypse Now does this perfectly. I can't think of anything better for it to be set to, the Vietnam War and the insanity in the soliders' minds that it created. AN is a dark and brutal story about a long journey through some of the hairiest jungle in Vietnam, the ultimate destination of which is murder. Through it's use of music and score alone, we are thrown into a dark world of mystery, violence, and insanity. A perfect example of how to set mood through music alone is this film right here.    An overall great cast, with the exception of Laurence Fishburne, of which Sheen and Brando give us more than enough acting skills to spread around on our movie desire bread. I just don't like Fishburne, ever since I found out he was Cowboy Curtis in PeeWee's playhouse my contempt and hatred for this man has increased ten fold. I realize the pettiness of this but I simply do not care. We need to sick Gary Oldman on him. Brando is excellent as Col. Kurtz and I can't think of any other actor that could have played the good man gone insane and hold such screen presence. Sheen is also fun to watch as Willard and we can identify with his questioning of his mission and the war in general. My favorite character in the movie has to be Robert Duvall's Lt. Colonel Kilgore. Before this film I never pictured Duvall as a wartime cowboy but honestly it's my favorite of his parts to date.

The son is murdered by a mysterious girlfriend, played by Ashley Judd, and our spy starts to tail Judd from afar, using all the paraphernalia of his trade. He becomes more and more obsessed and soon progresses from spy to stalker to guardian angel as she disposes of lover after lover during her dashes across the States, winding up in Alaska, at the end of the world. Not until the last act do the stalker and the killer exchange any meaningful dialogue, and, on the trudge to the final act, we learn very little about the two characters and even less about their motivations.Like many movies, this one draws extremes of praise and rancour. It is not an enjoyable film, but some elements compel us to watch it and to watch it again, and we are left wondering why this should be the case. From one angle, this is easy the two stars are good at their job and both are highly watchable. But what holds our interest after the closing credits is more significant and that is that this film could have been so much better, that some poor decisions were taken at the writing stage and that with these two headliners, Eye of the Beholder could have been a memorable offering. MacGregor's stalker is fleshed out almost entirely by the irritating presence in his imagination of his daughter, whom he lost when his wife left some time ago, and his imaginary conversations with this child provide some vestiges of character and motivation; other than that, we are on our own. A couple of minutes at the beginning with the character interacting with a real girlfriend or on some sort of assignment might have had us rooting for him much, much more. As it is, he is hardly more than a cipher. Similarly, Judd's killer is even more of a mystery and we never really understand why she is so murderous. Again, a few minutes of exposition in the early stages could have heightened the viewer's interest in and empathy for her character as she is presented to us, our only interest in her is that she's being played by Ashley Judd. Neither Judd nor MacGregor could have done anymore with the material given to them, short of returning the screenplay with a polite no, thank you.I could not recommend this movie, nor could I call it a bad movie. For me, Ashley Judd could never be boring, and there are bucketloads of moviegoers who would sit back happily while Ewan MacGregor painted a wall white and watched it dry. But, aside from curiosity about the two stars, unless you are interested in how and why projects with good potential fail to deliver the goods so spectacularly, this is probably one to avoid.

Die Hard 2 Die Harder completely does away with believability and goes for a comic-book level of reality. Of its type, it is an entertaining and well-made film. Fairly frequently you may find yourself groaning with despair at some of the unlikelihoods (for example, how long do those grenades take to detonate when the bad guys corner Willis in Esperanza's plane cockpit?), but the breathless pacing and spectacular set pieces should just about win you over enough to get a thumbs-up rating out of you. Story, as already mentioned, is pure fantasy. One year on from his escapades in Part One, John McClane (Willis) is awaiting the arrival of his wife's plane at Washington Dulles Airport. On the same evening a team of heavily armed, ruthlessly organised mercenaries, led by Colonel Stuart (William Sadler), seize control of the airport. Their objective is to liberate a Central American revolutionary named Esperanza (Franco Nero) who is being flown into Washington under armed guard. They threaten to start bringing down planes if anyone tries to foul up their elaborate plans. But of course, McClane - as we all know - is a dab-hand at thwarting terrorists, and once again he single-handedly takes them on. The film might have fared better were it not a Die Hard sequel. McClane wouldn't go through an ordeal like this twice in his lifetime, so immediately the film becomes a joke in terms of logic and feasibility. Also, there's a bit too much posturing. A good example is near the start when bad guy Sadler is practising his karate moves naked in front of a mirror, and also as the bad guys prepare to head off on their evil mission they march down a corridor in their headquarters, each man coming out of his room with ludicrously immaculate timing to join the back of the queue! However, Die Hard 2 makes up for its weaknesses on other levels. The set pieces are excellent, including a hair-raising plane crash, a snow-mobile chase and a fight on the wing of a moving aircraft. Similarly, the dialogue is well written, veering expertly between knowing humour and square-jawed declarations of courage. On the performance front, Dennis Farina steals the show, etching a memorable portrayal as an abrasive airport cop. Die Hard 2 asks for a massive suspension of disbelief.

","genre":"Drama, History, Thriller"},{"date":"17 June 2004","score":"3 out of 15 people found the following review useful","review":"  One of the most important films. Many will disagree with that, but it's not a statement just about the film itself, it's also about the fact that Oliver Stone had the balls to make this interesting political masterpiece. Anyone with half of a brain knows that the Warren Report was the biggest joke on the American public ever conceived, and Stone decided to rock the house with his theory about the Kennedy assassination. Is all of it true? Of course not, but that is entirely irrelevant. Do you think the magic bullet theory was true? Case closed. Time and time again, the US government has tried to fool us into believing their ridiculous theory to try and cover up the lies...and considering most people truly are stupid, it has worked. Why do you think that the full details are still not to be released for many years? Could it be that by that time, everyone guilty will be dead or the fact that we as a nation won't care as much anymore because it'll be old news? Gee, I wonder. The simple fact that someone put forth a theory about the JFK incident on film for the public to see is extremely important because it made people think, and still does. The people that bash this film because it's propaganda have entirely missed the point and are the same ones so easily fooled by the government. Beyond that, JFK is an excellent film is all respects. It's about the investigation and the one and only court case that was brought to raise questions about the Warren Report to display the government for what it is, liars and murderers, by New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison. Filled with an excellent cast and directed superbly, JFK raises many questions and still provides classic entertainment. A bit long for some, but most likely for those with a closed mind or those that are afraid to believe anything other than what the government tells us. baaa-baaaa. Carry on sheep people. Here's Love Connection, watch this and get fat and stupid, by the way, keep drinking beer you f***ing morons! If you know where that came from then you know where I'm coming from. R.I.P.Forgive me for the comparison, but it is much like Dr. Strangelove in that it's not just a film, but one with a political statement. Of course, Dr. Strangelove is a better film and has much more of an important statement, but still, they're similar in that respect. As mentioned previously, the cast is simply excellent and particularly Costner, Pesci and Oldman. Kevin Bacon and Tommy Lee Jones' characters are also humorous and depicted with skill.

He put a lot of passion and volatility into the young Stoddard and a lot of bluff and stuffiness into the older version. I always loved the irony of the ending. Edmond O'Brien is wonderful as the drunken newspaper editor but I wonder if his miraculous recovery had something to do with Ford keeping his options open as to cutting the film down in the editing process. It does seem a bit too long.O'Brien played a similar over- the -top character in The Girl Can't Help It which any fan of fifties pop culture should see if they haven't already. He's also great in the Wild Bunch which should be seen in the longest version available.I bought the DVD of Valance and was surprised that the theme song sung by Gene Pitney was not in the film!

Okay.  Why do I keep revisiting this film, and why do I hold it to such a high regard?  Two words - acting and directing.  If this is the first 'real' horror movie, or the first slasher film, it is the best because it doesn't fall into the traps associated with later (and cheesier) horror films.  For one, all of the characters are 'real' and intelligent.  Sure, Norman Bates is weird, and Marion Crane is scared of him, but she's also sympathetic to his plight.  It isn't like he's waving around butcher knives and she says, Hmm, well, I think I'll go take a shower now!  The conversation in Norman's parlour ends on a pleasant note (after having navigated through some very dark material) and she leaves to go prepare for bed - she couldn't have suspected what was about to happen or the audience would have suspected it too - the killing wouldn't have been a shock at all. Another thing about these 'real' characters.  Arbogast starts out hard-boiled, but his conversatin with Norman in the motel office seems so real to the point where I suspect that the dialogue was ad-libbed.  But of course Hitchcock wouldn't have allowed that.  But the dialogue doesn't sound scripted at all.  It's all in the delivery - very effective, we get to see that Arbogast is very good at his job - not an amateur at all.  When Sam and Lila go to the motel to do their own investigation, there is inspired dialogue that you wouldn't hear in a conventional horror film.  For one thing, when they enter the bathroom, the scene of the earlier carnage, Sam matter-of-factly remarks there's no shower curtain.  It's just a coment, and neither character dwells on this miniscule of details - how could they have guessed that it was used to wrap Marion's body with before she was dumped in her car trunk?  As well, when Sam decides to occupy Norman while Lila searches the house, he says If you find anything, anything at all, don't stop to tell me.  See?  Again, this wouldn't have occurred in a regular movie. The characters are intelligent and think out their actions before they act on them.  And while Lila is put in the position of choosing to either run out the back door of Norman's house or down the flight of stairs and into the basement, she chooses the stairs (famous horror movie mistake) not because she is stupid, but because she is curious and wants nothing else but to find out what happened to her sister. It's one thing to have a main character massacred halfway through the film, but it's a much different movie that show's the intricate clean up of the crime scene - the mopping up of the blood, the wiping of the floor, walls and bathtub, the careful disposal of the body, etc, etc.  While the murder last for less than 30 seconds, the clean up goes on for 10 minutes, and makes the scene far, FAR more disturbing.  Watching dutiful Norman clean up his 'Mother's' mess, looking at the blood on his hands, smiling happily as the car sinks below the surface of his backyard swamp...well, it reaches a level of 'disturbing' that most movies hope to achieve but never reach. And the last line  Why, she wouldn't even harm a fly....  Enough said.

Randle MacMurphy thinks a little time in the mental hospital will be like a vacation from jail. He soon finds out it might not be as easy as he thought. Nurse Ratchett runs the unit he is placed on and she likes things her way, or no way at all. MacMurphy becomes a hero to the other patients by standing up to her, despite the repercussions. On one occasion he and two patients end up with shock treatments. There are several odd patients, but MacMurphy takes an interest in one, a big Indian whom he calls Chief.MacMurphy pull several stunts from hijacking a bus full of patients to go fishing to bribing a night guard to let two women with booze come in during Christmas. After a violent attack on Nurse Ratchett, the hospital staff deals with MacMurphy.The film is set in two places the hospital ward and the fishing trip. I feel the primary message the director is attempting to present is one of total loss of control. Nurse Ratchett easily manipulates the other patients, and MacMurphy finds out that going against her is a very bad idea. I felt at first that MacMurphy was the one who 'flew over the cuckoo's nest,' but instead I think it was the Chief. Throughout the movie, he keeps a very low profile. The staff thinks he is deaf and dumb, but he can hear and talk. Since I work in a maximum-security mental hospital, I know first hand that the patients who were acting crazy did a great job. We also get patients like MacMurphy who are sent to our facility from jail for acting crazy to keep from going to prison.The scene where MacMurphy was given shock treatments was so disturbing; nowadays it would take a Doctor months to get the courts permission to do such a treatment.
