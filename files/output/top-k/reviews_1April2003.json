After Alien was tense thriller, Aliens added a big-boom-action element, for which there couldn't have been anyone better than James Cameron. Alien 3 tried to mix the elements of thriller and action a bit more than the second movie had done and, while being too cartoonish as a whole, succeeded in that and - to this reviewer - it was a step down but still OK.Then there's this!

No, I'll forgive this person, whoever he was. But who were the geniuses that said Wow! What a great idea!

Or that the movie starts and ends with dream sequences of a woman taking a shower and getting killed? This is another De Palma cheesefest, filled with sexism, split-screens, Pino Donaggio music and deviant behavior like transvestites\/transsexuality. DRESSED TO KILL is filled with SO many contrived moments that it almost becomes deliriously funny. Here are a couple of examplesAfter Angie has sex with the man at his apartment, she finds out that he has some sort of venereal disease. Shock! But the thing is, when was this doctor's report made? 6 months ago? 12 months ago? In other words, the film makes a big point to show something like this and yet forgoes all other aspects about this shocking revelation that divorces it from reality. The man might have already been cured for all we know. Making a big fuss over things that might be explained a bit more rationally only makes DTK look silly and overwrought. Yes, I know that it's all about Angie's feelings of guilt but the way it's handled in DTK still makes me laugh for all the wrong reasons.And when Angie is in the elevator and realizes she left her wedding ring at the man's apartment she goes back to the seventh floor only to face the killer there who subsequently slashes her to death. First, how did the killer know that Angie would return to the seventh floor? Second, how did the killer anticipate that Angie would be alone in the elevator? Third, if the killer bothers to murder Angie in the elevator, why doesn't the killer stop the elevator on the seventh floor or in between floors? This would have prevented the elevator from going up or down to other floors where people are waiting patiently and who would be witnesses to the murder. Massive and inexcusable plot-holes.There are numerous other silly details, like the kid playing Hardy Boys and creating a camera that takes time-lapsed still shots of the doctor's office, or the whole pointless split-screen moment, when we see, on the left side of the screen, Michael Caine listening to disturbing messages and watching documentaries on transsexuals, and on the right, we see Nancy Allen being chased by, gasp, a tall blonde woman. Those scenes are only there to pad the movie's length. They are pointless. And to make things even more deliriously silly, De Palma shamelessly channels Hitchcock, which gives another layer of unintentional weirdness\/awfulness to it all.Even with all it's flashy camera-work and violence, DRESSED TO KILL is surprisingly low key. At times, it looks and feels like a low budget film. There are just a couple of set pieces. And there are only a couple of characters. The film feels small. And like every Brian De Palma films (his big or low budget ones), there is one great scene that stands out, this one being the entire museum scene, but then everything else falls apart fast soon afterwards. DRESSED TO KILL peaks very early and there's simply nothing interesting that happens after the elevator scene. Michael Caine, straight from two disaster epics (THE SWARM and BEYOND THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE, both bombed massively), sleepwalks through his role. Nancy Allen is sexy in a sassy and street-smart way but I felt at times that she didn't care much for the whole thing. That she was above this kind of film. And the guy who played the kid was okay but I never liked his role. He doesn't seem to belong in this type of film. In the end, Angie's character is the only one in the movie who seemed to have a semblance of depth. It's not much but seems to be much when compared to the cardboard characters populating the film. It's one of Angie's best performances. And as for the dream sequences, they're totally gratuitous. One was enough. I don't see the reason for book-ending the film with two similar dream sequences. They're contrived and just a tad tasteless, to say the least, certainly the one with Angie's body double. The second dream sequence reinforces the fact that De Palma didn't have a good script and didn't know where or how to end the movie. I mean, there are three endings in DTK.In closing, I have to admit that the first time I saw DTK, I HATED it! I still do BUT now having been a fan of the giallo genre for many years, which DRESSED TO KILL was obviously inspired by it, I can now finally put DTK in some sort of context (other than a cheap Hitchcock rip-off) and see it for what it is (or for what it tried to be) it's a definite mixture of gialli and Hitchcock films. As mildly amusing as DTK is, I can't help but wonder if De Palma and Dario Argento weren't competing with each other back in the 1970s and early 1980s, continuously trying to top each other with these giallos, or gory thrillers. Of the two filmmakers, I prefer Dario films made before PHENOMENA. TENEBRE seems to be Dario's answer to DTK and as uneven as TENEBRE is, it is more rewarding than DRESSED TO KILL. At least TENEBRE has a real transsexual. LOL!

Massive and inexcusable plot-holes.There are numerous other silly details, like the kid playing Hardy Boys and creating a camera that takes time-lapsed still shots of the doctor's office, or the whole pointless split-screen moment, when we see, on the left side of the screen, Michael Caine listening to disturbing messages and watching documentaries on transsexuals, and on the right, we see Nancy Allen being chased by, gasp, a tall blonde woman. Those scenes are only there to pad the movie's length. They are pointless. And to make things even more deliriously silly, De Palma shamelessly channels Hitchcock, which gives another layer of unintentional weirdness\/awfulness to it all.Even with all it's flashy camera-work and violence, DRESSED TO KILL is surprisingly low key. At times, it looks and feels like a low budget film. There are just a couple of set pieces. And there are only a couple of characters. The film feels small. And like every Brian De Palma films (his big or low budget ones), there is one great scene that stands out, this one being the entire museum scene, but then everything else falls apart fast soon afterwards. DRESSED TO KILL peaks very early and there's simply nothing interesting that happens after the elevator scene. Michael Caine, straight from two disaster epics (THE SWARM and BEYOND THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE, both bombed massively), sleepwalks through his role. Nancy Allen is sexy in a sassy and street-smart way but I felt at times that she didn't care much for the whole thing. That she was above this kind of film. And the guy who played the kid was okay but I never liked his role. He doesn't seem to belong in this type of film. In the end, Angie's character is the only one in the movie who seemed to have a semblance of depth. It's not much but seems to be much when compared to the cardboard characters populating the film. It's one of Angie's best performances. And as for the dream sequences, they're totally gratuitous. One was enough. I don't see the reason for book-ending the film with two similar dream sequences. They're contrived and just a tad tasteless, to say the least, certainly the one with Angie's body double. The second dream sequence reinforces the fact that De Palma didn't have a good script and didn't know where or how to end the movie. I mean, there are three endings in DTK.In closing, I have to admit that the first time I saw DTK, I HATED it! I still do BUT now having been a fan of the giallo genre for many years, which DRESSED TO KILL was obviously inspired by it, I can now finally put DTK in some sort of context (other than a cheap Hitchcock rip-off) and see it for what it is (or for what it tried to be) it's a definite mixture of gialli and Hitchcock films. As mildly amusing as DTK is, I can't help but wonder if De Palma and Dario Argento weren't competing with each other back in the 1970s and early 1980s, continuously trying to top each other with these giallos, or gory thrillers. Of the two filmmakers, I prefer Dario films made before PHENOMENA. TENEBRE seems to be Dario's answer to DTK and as uneven as TENEBRE is, it is more rewarding than DRESSED TO KILL. At least TENEBRE has a real transsexual. LOL!

Or that the movie starts and ends with dream sequences of a woman taking a shower and getting killed? This is another De Palma cheesefest, filled with sexism, split-screens, Pino Donaggio music and deviant behavior like transvestites\/transsexuality. DRESSED TO KILL is filled with SO many contrived moments that it almost becomes deliriously funny. Here are a couple of examplesAfter Angie has sex with the man at his apartment, she finds out that he has some sort of venereal disease. Shock! But the thing is, when was this doctor's report made? 6 months ago? 12 months ago? In other words, the film makes a big point to show something like this and yet forgoes all other aspects about this shocking revelation that divorces it from reality. The man might have already been cured for all we know. Making a big fuss over things that might be explained a bit more rationally only makes DTK look silly and overwrought. Yes, I know that it's all about Angie's feelings of guilt but the way it's handled in DTK still makes me laugh for all the wrong reasons.And when Angie is in the elevator and realizes she left her wedding ring at the man's apartment she goes back to the seventh floor only to face the killer there who subsequently slashes her to death. First, how did the killer know that Angie would return to the seventh floor? Second, how did the killer anticipate that Angie would be alone in the elevator? Third, if the killer bothers to murder Angie in the elevator, why doesn't the killer stop the elevator on the seventh floor or in between floors? This would have prevented the elevator from going up or down to other floors where people are waiting patiently and who would be witnesses to the murder.

A group of teens are driving through Texas (I don't know why the plot outline says they are hippies) so a brother and sister can make sure a grave of a relative is undisturbed.  Apparently, a lot of bodies have been dug up in the cemetery and some of the bodies have even been put in crude poses.  The brother is confined to a wheelchair...also along for the drive is the sister's boyfriend and another young couple.  After the cemetery they drive along and see a hitchhiker and decide to pick him up.  This would be mistake number one for these rather stupid teens, but hey they are teens so it is realistic that they would be incredibly dumb.  The hitchhiker seems friendly enough at first, but later goes crazy so they dump him and continue on.  They then hit a gas station, but there is no gas.

I love cult. I love cult-movies. I love all kinds of cult-movies. I like everything from Monty Python, Highlander, Rocky Horror Picture Show, Night of the Living Dead, Evil Dead, Dead Alive, John Water's Hairspray, and even Ed Wood movies. Niche movies that are so bad they're good, or that are shunned by popular audiences because they were ahead of their times, that only a few caught on.Repo Man tries too damn hard. It tries to be witty with bizarre dialogue laced with profanity, like some quasi-proto-Tarantinoesque influence gurgles in this movie, but it's neither raw nor edgy, it just falls flat like bricks plopping out of the characters' mouths.Some scenes are painful to watch as characters stand around like they're waiting for their lines to be fed to them. Comedic action builds up like a steam-cooker set to ultra-low, and instead of a bang, it's more like a queef. The landscape of Eighties era Los Angeles, and its urban decay is an interesting backdrop to this cadre of Repo Men who live day-by-day like Japanese Ronin, with nothing but their wits and their Code of Honor but instead of building on this, it just comes off as - Who Cares?When I questioned the reason behind the Generic labeling of everything from Food to Beer- I thought it was perhaps the director attempting to get some subtext regarding the extremes of America's Free Capitalism and its antithesis, Communism, but after seeing the trivia on the movie here on IMDB, it's merely the fact that the director and producers couldn't get money for product placement.

I have always admired Time Travel movies, especially the original George Pal version of The Time Machine.  As It turned out, I didn't dislike this version, but it never did much in the way of drawing me in enough to care about what happens on the screen.  I think part of this lies in the beginning of the movie.  Guy Pearce wants to go back in time to save his girlfriend from being shot, which is his motivation for building The Time Machine in the first place.  Every time he tries to save her though, she still dies but in a different way.  While these scenes do well to supply motivation, (and believe me we have nothing against that, as too many characters in too many films never have any motivation) too much time is spent on this part of the story, so that in the long run, it does nothing more than take time away from Alexander's journey to the future. Part of the fun of the original was watching Rod Taylor's trip through time, until he arrived to the point in the future where he met the Eloi and The Morlocks.  The only interesting stop in Guy Pearce's journey is where he meets the librarian Vox,  which is merely a setup to run into Vox later in the future.  I had more fun watching Rod Taylor, crumble disintigrating books in his hands, and spinning gold rings to find out what he wanted to know.  Even the Morlocks in the 60's version, with their hokey makeup and grunts and groans were more entertaining than these gophers.I wish we had found out more about the Eloi, before the Morlocks had arrived on the scene.  I wish they had come up with something better than having the moon explode to cause all that destruction.  I wish the whole journey through time had been more entertaining.  I wish Guy Pearce hadn't needed the whole girlfriend bit to motivate him.

Safe from the law and living off the money he managed to put to one side when working.

As the unpredictably brutal Logan pressures Gal more and more he is faced with the possibility of having to return to England for a job.I watched this several years after it came out in the cinema so I was sheltered from much of the hype.  I'm not a huge fan of all these new British gangster movies that are about of late as many seem to be in awe of `Lock, Stock' and just are happy to copy rather than innovate.  Sexy Beast really gripped me for the most part because it doesn't try to copy like so many others.  Instead it is very stagey rather than slick and energetic.  The plot weakness is that it has nowhere to really go.  The `job' itself is pretty pointless and the key moment that is meant to have us on the edge of our seats doesn't really work.However what does work is the majority of the film where Gal and Logan standoff to each other.  This is very dialogue driven but really works mostly because of Kingsley who rightly got an Oscar nod for this.  He drives the film with his brutal and unpredictable character.  Winstone is good but is almost a support character when viewed beside Kingsley.  The support cast are OK with Fox and McShane being interesting but underused castings.The fantasy scenes are imaginative and the film is very stylishly done without copying off anyone else.  It falls a little flat towards the end and the `job' is not as exciting as one would have hoped &#150; basically once Logan `convinces' Gal to take the job the pressure cooker excitement is gone never to be replaced.

The scenes switch so quickly that you can never really see anyone truly dance, probably because they're not truly dancing. The exception is the final dance number where the Argentinian and one of the ladies tango and re-enact the lovers' story. However, that episode is so long drawn out and full of triteness that it becomes tedious.On the subject of editing, I felt that the editing failed to provide the awe, energy and pizzazz that some of the dance numbers required. It left the actors looking awkward and ridiculous in parts, in particular the scene in which the group is demonstrating the ideas for the new show to the Baron.Although Nicole Kidman is beautiful and talented, I didn't think she was warm and sensual enough for the role of Satine, and although she's not a bad singer, I felt that most of her big songs lacked the oomph required to give proper effect.Overall, the feel of the film was very juvenile. I felt like the director was dumbing down the sophistication of what should\/could have been a smart, naughty story about love, lust, envy and greed in the underworld. Instead, it felt sanitized, and because of that became nothing more than a typical Hollywood date movie in lingerie.But the most painful of all were the dialog and the music. 90% of the film steals lines from contemporary pop music. And the lines are so brief and ecclectic it had me feeling like it was targeted towards people with Attention Deficit Disorder. I can only guess that it was an attempt to appeal to the masses -- and since I'm one of the few who didn't like this film, I guess it succeeded in that regard. Clever appropriation of well known music and words can be very effective, but in my opinion Moulin Rouge! missed the mark, choosing to totally saturate the film with line after line of quotes from mainstream pop music...not even something cleverly obscure, only the most obvious and mainstream so that the most unworldly of viewers was likely to get it.

Anyways the performances are vey convincing, Brendan Fraser is great as handsome hero, Rachel Weisz is great as Evy, a clumsy but very intelligent egyptologist, John Hannah delivers the humor in this movie as Jonathan, the good-for-nothing guy who only cares about money, I have to mention Oded Fehr too, he was pretty good as the mysterious and attractive Ardeth Bay, the leader of the Mejais who is in charge to put the mummy back in his grave, and how can I forget the Mummy himself, Arnold Vosloo, who was, without any doubt, the best one in this movie. His performance is so good as the evil and sexy high priest Imhotep, he doesn't make you hate him, he makes you feel sorry for him!  That is what I call acting skills.The plot is good, it's not a cheezy-horror flick or something like that, and the dialogues are awesome too ) Let's not forget the direction, Stephen Sommers does a great job.  And special mention to the music, by Jerry Goldsmith, it was one of the best parts of this movie.You get a lot of candy eye in this movie, for guys and girls, for guys you get Rachel Weisz and in the beginning of the movie you see the Venezuelan top-model Patricia Velazques as the unfaithful Anck-su-namun; and for girls you get Brendan Fraser, Oded Fehr and of course Arnold Vosloo.Anyways I highly recommend this movie, THIS IS A MUST-SEE. ***** out of ***** ","genre":"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"},{"date":"1 April 2003","score":"19 out of 21 people found the following review useful","review":"  Usually I review a movie just after I've seen it, but the last time I saw this one was a full 2 weeks ago. Yet it still sticks in my mind and heart.Baseball movies are inspirational by nature and seem to have all kinds of application to life (for example, my review of Field of Dreams). Jimmy Morris challenges the losing baseball team he's coaching to not give up on their dreams and has the challenge thrown right back at him. This wouldn't make for such drama if the majority of the movie up to that point hadn't been to show how Jimmy's own dream had been systematically dismantled. Such movies anyone can write, but when I found out it was a true story, it put the movie in a higher bracket altogether. The conflict between Jimmy and his father is played very well by both Quaid and Cox. At one point or another, you can just feel coldness of the walls built up between them. They're reaching out (Hunter's baseball glove, Jimmy's asking advice), but can they ever connect? While some might balk (sorry) at the presence of Hunter, Jimmy's son, I think the kid adds a lot to the film. Baseball is all about kids, anyway. And it's good to see a son who looks up to and believes in his dad. That phase is over far too soon for most fathers to enjoy it enough. I think the dream is as much Hunter's as it is his father's.The theme of the Rookie is never give up on your dreams. That's laudable. But the affirmation of the importance of families, even through broken relationships, as well as a clean script, makes this one that families can buy to watch every now and then. Disney surprised me with this believable, down-to-earth tale. I'm definitely picking this one up on DVD.

Compared to other films of this type, it ranks somewhere between the Road Warrior\/Mad Max series and The Postman. The story begins with a young Quinn discovering a hidden cave in a newly-renovated section of the London Underground - then stumbling upon a fire-breathing dragon which has been trapped there for eons. Unfortunately, no explanation is given as to the origins of the dragon but suffice to say that the dragon emerges from his slumber, kills Quinn's mother (a wasted cameo appearance by Alice Krige), then begins to terrorize the world. Skipping the worldwide destruction which ensues, the film next jumps 12 years in the future and shows a grown-up Quinn (played capably by Christian Bale) leading a rag-tag group of survivors who live in relative peace in northern England. The dragons, however, have multiplied a thousand-fold, and now dominate the earth. At this point, Matthew McConaughey enters as the robust leader of a group of American dragon-slayers. Again, it is best not to think too hard about how a group of Americans ended up in England in such a chaotic world - although it would have been interesting to actually see how they did it, based upon their explanation of it in the film. In any case, from this point forward, the film's action really picks up and, at times, is very compelling. In retrospect, I wish the point of view for the entire film had been from the perspective of the Van Zan character (McConaughey), as he actually tends to steal the movie away from the Quinn character. Rob Bowman's direction of `Reign of Fire is well done, really, considering that he began as a regular director of several X-Files episodes, as well as the X-Files movie. In fact, the entire film has a certain dark eerieness about it which looks not unlike an extended episode of that now-defunct series. The effects are well done, too, although too limited in their scope. We see the flying dragons from time to time, and they do look convincing. What is missing, however, is the context of how destructive the dragons are. We see only the results of their destruction in brief, panoramic CGI views of a destroyed London - nothing more. If only this film had had a bigger budget, we could have seen more backstory about the dragons, but alas, this is missing. Obviously, viewers should NOT go into Reign of Fire looking for an Oscar winner - and WITH a healthy dose of suspension-of-disbelief - but given those parameters, it can be quite entertaining.

This is still a good flick. Every Vietnam War movie I've seen before this one seems to have some angle, some statement to be made. Just like Job's friends, when we see something that doesn't make sense, it's human nature to put out our own take on it to try to reconcile what we have experienced. Yet, this is one of the few movies that hesitates to carry that burden. It doesn't overtly accuse the politicians, the press or the military for Vietnam's ultimate failure. It tells a story from a Lt. Colonel's perspective, not coming from some frightened kid's coming-of-age perspective and not with some leftist ideological blinders like Born on the Fourth of July, or Platoon, or--shudder--Apocalypse Now. It's told by a man who understands battle, the killing, and the maiming. It's told to pay tribute to men who answered their country's call to go and fight.And men they were. They were men with families and friends. They were men who risked seeing their children grow up because of their willingness to go fight. As a father, that hits home. Few war movies pause to address the internal conflict a soldier must face prior to deployment and the turmoil it creates with those who love them. Fewer still recognize faith and religion's impact on the whole equation. It only adds depth to their characters and makes them more real. Man is a spiritual being, and far too often, that fact is overlooked for telling a story or to keep from making people uncomfortable.There are some intense moments and very graphic violence. The casual viewer may overlook one scene where a guy is struck by phosphorous. But burning phosphorous is like little chunks of the sun and it won't stop burning for anything. The aftermath where his buddy helps him still chills me because I know a little about what has to happen for him to survive. On the whole, the gore is significant and extensive. Braveheart and Saving Private Ryan are comparably tame by some measures. So unless you *live* for that sort of thing, you may come away with a queasy stomach.I watched this during the second Persian Gulf War, so the ramifications of soldiers dying hit with much more force.
