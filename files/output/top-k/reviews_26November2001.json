There seems to be almost no criticism of the cast - in my opinion this is probably the best cast film I have seen since Casablanca (and I thought Paul Henreid\/Victor Laszlo was pretty doubtful - who would get killed for a wimp like him?). Similarly, there has been, as far as I can see, none at all of the visualization of the train, Hogwart's school, Hagrid's hut or any of the other locations. In fact, King's Cross station platforms 9 and 10 are much less interesting than the film version. OK Harry's cubby-hole was less grim than I had imagined, and the Dursleys less wicked and malevolent, but I suspect more literal visual versions of the book would begin to raise questions about why Harry hadn't been carted off by social workers.The filmmakers have managed to1) Satisfy the primary target audience of the books, viz. children from 8 to 142) Satisfy the adult readers of the series who find the books a witty and compelling read3) Satisfy some of the adult non-readers, and after all, if you haven't been persuaded to read Harry Potter by the sheer magnitude of the interest, then you probably aren't very susceptible to this kind of thing4) Capture enough of the essence of a fairly anarchic English boarding school to make it into a place which is in fact dominated by a society of children, even if the adults are nominally in charge.The film had to be a massive compromise; it could not contain every detail. I should have liked more Snape, more Scabbers and more Hermione being clever, and being lonely, more Weasleys &#133; but then I usually manage to sit through Seven Samurai in  one go, few 8 years olds have the bladder capacity to manage that.JK Rowling's style is, in many ways, very 'flat'; she tells you just what you need to know- though you don't always realize it-  with sharp wit, so there was only a very limited scope for interpreting the story without distorting it. This is, perhaps, the exact opposite of Shakespeare where the richness of the language allows all kinds of distortion of the presentation without any harm at all being done to the play, indeed the most basic production can sometime bring out the genius of the language better than large amounts of 'reality' can.Chris Columbus was on a hiding to nothing. A darker film would have had parents complaining that their 8 year old needed therapy after seeing Voldemort, a more slapstick film would have infuriated the adult readers, a more 'adult' version would have debased the underlying insecurity and humanity of Harry, and a Hollywood brat version would have had UK audiences setting fire to the cinema.I both enjoyed the film enormously, and on reflection consider that, although it was a very easy box office success, it was actually, I suspect, a very difficult project.

To me thinking of some American actor stumbling around as Potter or Granger faking a British accent would have been just terrible. Thankfully Chris Columbus who seems to be the last person I would be praising after Nine Months, decided to steer off from that Hollywood movie machine idea. And speaking of the actors, they all do a wonderful job fleshing out the characters especially the young leads. Daniel Radcliffe finds just the right note making Harry Potter a character every audience member can envy and cheer at the same time time. Emma Watson plays the feisty Hermione Granger almost exactly as she is written in the book with that little bit of tartness I think most young girls have at that age( at least my sister does anyway.) Tom Felton hits just the right note of pure arrogance and prissyness as Draco Malfoy that you just want some to stand up and slap him during the movie. And Rupert Grint has fun delivering some of the funniest lines in the movie while also becoming equally as heroic as his two counterparts when the time calls for it. As for their older counterparts, they all play to greater range than would usually be called for in a movie of this type. Richard Harris is a standout as headmaster Albus Dumbeldore and Maggie Smith shines as Minerva McGonagle.

Perhaps in one of the scenes involving Harry and his friends sneaking around the school at night while being followed by Mr. Filch the schools caretaker, he could have popped up. Maybe?

I am a great admirer of Steven Spielberg's early works--especially his small, great film Duel. The later works of Spielberg have relied on emotions of audiences, not cinema as a creative medium or as a vehicle to present intelligent perspectives. It is sad that Terrence Mallick's intelligent film The Thin Red Line on the same war lost out to this melodramatic, ordinary effort from a man who has done better films when he had less success and money. A few shots of the old Spielberg did surface briefly when the film captured the first rain drops and the boots of soldiers getting wet.Hollywood has made better war films than this one. The little known Castle Keep was one such film. Spielberg knows what appeals to the average American mind and makes movies that will be lapped up without giving the average moviegoer any reason to reflect or think. He has begun to play on emotions and is no longer reaching out to thinking viewers. He is aware that this will not make the box-office jingle. Most people do go to movies to relax, not to be wiser. Mallick, on the other hand, makes movies the way he wants them made forcing his viewers to think. Mallick will slowly be recognized as a master filmmaker in the US by adults as time goes by, while Spielberg will continue to appeal to the juvenile minds of adults, who love action and emote easily. The difference was evident, when the Berlin International Film Festival recognized Mallick's film with top honor and the Academy Awards bestowed its top honors on Spielberg in the same year.
