The bizarre part though is not a bad thing. It is bizarre like the movie Zardoz is bizarre. The strangeness of the film actually helps it reach new heights and makes it so that the length of the film is more tolerable. The film is about some sort of strange future or possibly another world entirely where this man is living in some sort of place where the government is a bit of a totalitarian type government. He has what looks like a office type job in a rather different type of place and he is going through some different type times. He sees a girl though that he falls madly in love with as she is the one he dreams about in these very strange, but surprisingly well done sequences where he has wings and must battle strange things. Honestly, I am not really doing the film much justice, but it is so hard to describe, which is one of the appeals of this movie. If it was a bit shorter and the ending a bit less dreary I would have liked it more maybe, or maybe a little less. There are some stars in this one, but no one really big as Robert DeNiro is probably the biggest and he really only has what amounts to a cameo appearance. Still, they are not unknowns in this film, just more the type you see in a supporting role. So all in all a rather surreal film that was strange and rather good. Just not good in a way that I wish to see the movie a lot, more like maybe once every couple of years or so. That way you forget stuff and the movie still has that strange bite to it.

Both films feature characters from Rudyard Kipling's book of the same name, which I have never read. I think it was on the last week of 1994, in between Christmas and New Year's, when I went to see this live action version in the theatre. I was eight years old, and can't remember exactly what I thought, but certainly don't recall finding it boring. Shortly after that, I remember seeing at least a bit of it again at school, but don't recall seeing any of it after that until last night, when I saw it for the first time in well over a decade. It looked mildly disappointing at first, but didn't stay that way.Set in Victorian-era India, five year old Mowgli goes on a hunting expedition with his father in the jungles of India and quickly befriends Katherine Kitty Brydon, the five year old daughter of English colonel Geoffrey Brydon. After a tiger named Shere Khan kills Mowgli's father, the little boy finds himself lost in the jungle, and is raised by animals. He grows up here, living like the jungle animals and learning how to communicate with them. One day, Kitty happens to be in the jungle again, and Mowgli sees her, which lures him back to the village where his childhood friend still lives with her father. Kitty and Dr. Julien Plumford begin to reintroduce him to human life and teach him English, and Mowgli shows Kitty what life is like in the jungle. While these two are nice to him, there are other British colonists who look down on him, including Kitty's arrogant suitor, Captain William Boone. Mowgli is also disgusted when he learns about human laws.Around the beginning, when Mowgli and Kitty are five years old, it gets pretty sappy between the two. The musical score is really overdone in some scenes, such as the one where Mowgli discovers Monkey City, and often gets too sappy in the romantic scenes. There are several groin-kicking scenes, which are unnecessary, especially for a family movie. Despite the severe flaws, however, there's more good than bad. Jason Scott Lee does a very nice job playing the likable lead, and the acting in general is good here, including memorable performances from Lena Headey as Kitty and John Cleese as Dr. Plumford. The humour in this film is never hilarious, but is sometimes at least mildly amusing, such as the part where Dr. Plumford says, No. That's not a boat. That's Queen Victoria. I think casting a former Monty Python comedian (Cleese) in the movie helped. The adventure often gets exciting, very much so later on, and there are touching moments as well. One particularly heart-wrenching scene is Mowgli finding Baloo severely injured. This is a scene I clearly remember from my first viewing! Even though the 1967 and 1994 films have the same title and several of the same characters, and they are both from Disney, one being animated and the other live action is not the only major difference. The plot is a little different, and this film is significantly darker than the cartoon version. There are live action movies with talking animals (such as the hit 1995 family film, Babe), but this is not one of them. I'm not saying this is a good or bad thing, but it is another notable difference between these two Disney flicks. However, despite being very different, both films are good. One of the reasons for the PG rating of this version is the violence, which occasionally includes some fairly gory scenes. I wouldn't recommend this film for kids much younger than I was during its theatrical run, but for older kids and others who like adventure movies, this COULD be entertaining. It's no masterpiece, but it is fairly underrated.

Val surprisingly has the charisma to succeed as Batman, which really surprised me, believe me. His chemistry with Kidman was very good, as well. Tommy Lee Jones&Jim Carrey are terrific, hammy villains. They play off one another wonderfully, and gave an entertaining show.

With these solid performances and terrific bursts of action as well as some very impressive 1960s special effects, audience members more than willingly allow credibility to go out the window and let the sheer entertainment value of the movie overwhelm them. It's about a (fictional) story of a group of World War II soldiers who are given the task to approach a cliff-sided town of Navarone, controlled by the Germans. The British navy cannot attack the coast on account of two very cliff-mounted large cannons, the titular guns of Navarone, that guard it. So it is up to this small group of men led by Gregory Peck to scale the cliff, invade the town, clear out any Germans that get in their way, and set charges that will destroy the cannons so that an approaching naval fleet can take over.Yes, if you are looking for a credible story, keep on the search, for The Guns of Navarone requires you to suspend your disbelief in the face of its plot. However, it is ten times as intelligent as half the action flicks I've seen come out in the past ten years and a hundred times as much fun. The movie sets up the plot right away and proceeds to become a quintessentially exciting WWII adventure. And that's the sheer fun of the movie. It's not simply a mission to blow up the guns. It's an adventure story, very much like a journey. The characters are very well-shaped and very well-acted and I was very pleased to see them portrayed by actors older than the conventional war movie leads. By casting older, more experienced actors, the filmmakers give us a sense of experienced soldiers, professionals on the job and they can be credible if the plot or circumstances they are placed in are not.And I cannot leave out the best thing in the movie &#x96; the action scenes.

It did well enough to earn a sequel that was actually made by the main Disney animation department (The Rescuers Down Under), but I can't imagine kids today preferring to watch this all the time when they've got the likes of WALL-E and Enchanted also on DVD.I remember watching The Rescuers a bit as a young child and liked it a lot. However, I have to say that The Rescuers doesn't hold up all too well for me any more. There are a number of Disney films that I greatly prefer now to when I was a kid. Yet The Rescuers, which was a favourite of mine as a child, seems to have gone the other way. It's by no means a complete loser, but it's also not a complete winner.The Rescuers tells the story of two mice from the Rescue Aid Society (a mouse version of the United Nations, who are housed in the basement of the larger orginisation's head quarters in New York), Bernard and Bianca. They are sent on a mission to rescue (well, what else are they supposed to do?) a young orphan girl named Penny, who is being held in an isolated swamp in the Deep South by an evil lady called Madame Medusa, who wants to use her to go down into a tiny cave in order to retrieve the Devil's Eye, which stands as the world's largest diamond in this story.Madame Medusa is quite a well realised creation. Enough so, in fact, that she almost ranks up there with the likes of the most evil animated creations. Admittedly, she is Cruella De Vil made to look like Shirley Bassey, but she still has enough going for her. She is greedy, sleazy and has even more wicked intentions in the race to get what she wants; there are hints that she even has the intention to leave the orphan alone in the swamp so as to cover up her initial kidnap once the diamond is found. In truth, she would have been more detestable had she gone and out-right said that she planned to leave the girl on a decaying show boat in a crocodile infested swamp, but she still comes across as wicked enough.Needless to say, the rest of The Rescuers isn't as stellar. For the most part, the film is actually rather dated. It has a contemporary setting and although this does not in theory make any film dated, it does in this case. The soundtrack and songs, which are by no means bad, have a semi-disco quality that makes them seem like time relics. And some of the fashions and backgrounds seem so unmistakeably 70s that they become cringe-making.The film also seems more childish. For some reason, perhaps due to the fact that nearly all of the animal characters seem to be wearing clothes in an otherwise realistic world, the whole piece seems like it was suggested by a story that a seven year old wrote. In addition, Penny the orphan is quite cloying, more so than any animals in Bambi or numerous Pooh characters could be.To be perfectly honest, the whole film comes across as fairly tired. The animation department at Disney supposedly lost a lot of confidence after Walt died until the new regime in the mid 80s brought enough punch to get the animators and artists creating the likes of The Little Mermaid. The Rescuers does seem to emphasise the theory of loss of confidence. Its sequel, released during the era of The Little Mermaid and Aladdin, actually ends up having more spark than this film. The animation here is sometimes so sketchy that it becomes hard to like, and the story isn't extremely inventive (it really feels like 101 Dalmatians, though with an orphan instead of puppies and an American setting instead of a British one), and as previously mentioned, is quite childish. There is the odd bit of cleverness (the leaf boat that the mice sail in, for example), but the film can be rather slow at times, and it seems as though the crew in charge simply couldn't be bothered to speed it up. Some of it actually comes across as filler; a scene involving Bernard and Bianca searching for Penny's orphanage could have been trimmed without much damage to the film, as could the odd line of dialogue here and there.The Rescuers is by no means the worst animated film ever made (this is no Black Cauldron!), but if you're wanting to be introduced to the greatest Disney classics, don't think that this is simply going to be an underrated gem that's worth starting the movie marathon off.

That's why I think it's unfair to compare this with 'Dracula' (although I do prefer the 1931's version of 'Dracula', but as I said...). The acting is really the main reason this movie is so famous.

It isn't told well, and looks a bit confusing. The titles are too vague, and they don't really explain what's going on. This is one of these movies in which you don't really care what's going to happen. The plot is about a house salesman that is sent to Transylvania in order to sell a house to Count Orlok. The Count buys the house, but only because he is interested in the Count's wife. After this point, the story turns into something weird, and nothing like 'Dracula'. That's why I think it's unfair to compare this with 'Dracula' (although I do prefer the 1931's version of 'Dracula', but as I said...). The acting is really the main reason this movie is so famous. The supporting cast is all excellent, but it's the main part that steals all your attention. Max Schreck is absolute perfect as Count Orlok. He provides a haunting, yet serious and scary interpretation. There's even one movie in which the matter of him been a true vampire is discussed (2000's 'Shadow of the Vampire').The other aspects aren't really worth mentioning. F. W. Murrau's directing is okay for 1922, so is the rest. The titles are well made, but confusing. One thing that really bothered me was the blue and yellow tints to represent night and day, but this is not a problem only with this movie. Lots of 1920's silent movies utilize this resource.Overral, this is a mice movie, with an excellent acting, but a confusing and bad-told story. From its period, I prefer much more the also German 'The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari'.7\/10 ","genre":"Fantasy, Horror"},{"date":"24 January 2010","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Jules Verne's early sci-fi classic was one of the first books I ever read as an infant, so it was nice after all these years to see a colourful, entertaining, if slightly anachronistic and underpowered, telling of the tale.Captain Nemo in my opinion is certainly one of the more complex and deep (no pun intended) characters in children's fiction and I was very pleased with James Mason's conviction-led performance. He is the black heart at the centre of the movie and he commands that mixture of shock and awe for want of a better expression, sufficient in his bloody-mindedness to amongst other things, imprison and almost drown the three innocent prisoners he reluctantly takes on board, sink without compassion a battleship containing a full crew and finally take his own unswervingly loyal crew with him to their doom as, mortally wounded, he finally gives up on humanity. I have happy memories of another Verne adaptation from the 50's with Mason in the lead, Journey To The Centre Of The Earth and hope to get the chance to see it again soon.Of course, being a Walt Disney production, these darker, more interesting moments are unfortunately jarringly offset by supposed action and comedic sequences. The Nautilus' encounter with a giant squid, which I remember as thrilling in the book is more akin to the 1966 Batman camp classic and the caped crusader's celebrated duel with a rubber shark! The attempts at humour come from Kirk Douglas' Ned Land character. Unfortunately Douglas plays it with more ham than a herd of pigs, only lacking a pipe and tattoos to complete the resemblance to Popeye. He acts like he's in a different film to everyone else and gets to sing, play a guitar and clown around with a pet seal, if you can believe it.I was amazed also to see the great Peter Lorre, again completely miscast, as the studious Professor's assistant.

Keep in mind my set of tastes isn't always entirely rational. While I have a penchant for upsetting, aggressive movies such as Hate and Natural Born Killers, I can also enjoy the subtlety of films like Dead Man or Wings of Desire. More often than not, I am drawn to thought provoking films no matter how much they try my patience or wrench my stomach. But then to spite myself, I'll fall in love with Starship Troopers. Go figure.This month, I turn your attention to the latest drama from Jane Campion, Holy Smoke, starring Kate Winslet (Titanic, Heavenly Creatures) and Harvey Keitel (The Bad Lieutenant, Mean Streets). (Pam Grier (Jackie Brown, Foxy Brown) gets third billing, but don't hold your breath or blink if her name drew you to the movie.) The movie opens in India where the young, beautiful and impressionable Ruth (Kate Winslet) and her Aussie friend are on vacation. Amongst the bustle of an overcrowded, smoke-filled plaza, Ruth notices other white girls dressed in saris, giggling and appearing to fit into these foreign and mystical surroundings.At this point I lost valuable screen time attempting to divine the meaning of the Neil Diamond tune playing over the images of ex-patriot hippies writhing on a rooftop in India, but soon I was pulled back to the rest of the plot's setup Ruth finds herself literally touched by a guru and believes that he has shown her the way to enlightenment. Her family, of course, believes she has been drugged or swindled into the starry notions the guru has fed her. They hire PJ Waters (Harvey Keitel) to rid her of the influence of the alleged cult leader. As PJ trains his will on Ruth to break her of her false mysticism, we are brought into intimate contact with Ruth's unresolved issues from a childhood crying for communication and nurturing.What follows is a well-acted tete-a-tete between the troubled Ruth and PJ's macho American caricature as they explore each other and themselves. This is the meaty section of the film where PJ systematically strips Ruth of her belongings, both physical and mental, that have anything to do with her India experience. In this process, the tables become turned as he is forced to look at himself in the mirror. At the finish line, Ruth's romantic notions are all but dead and PJ winds up in the middle of the desert wearing a dress and red lipstick. Who won the war of the wills? You be the judge.Holy Smoke is written by Jane Campion and her sister Anna and explores issues of a large dysfunctional suburban family and coercive, overbearing father figures. In other words, this is classic Campion. These have been common themes in Jane's previous work in one strain or another, and now her sister is getting in the same bed, if you will. Jane started exploring these issues in the mid 80's in her short films Peel, A Girl's Own Story, and Passionless Moments, and continued the thread with her features Sweetie and The Piano. In Holy Smoke, the Campion sisters dive head-first into the burning cauldron of sexual politics between a young woman searching for meaning and an adult well-entrenched in his beliefs. As in other Campion films, this films attempts to pull into focus the psycho-sexual nature of male-female relationships, especially young women's relationships with father figures. On one level the film seems to say that male domination is arousing, and on the other hand its message seems to be that a little T & A can go a long to making a man submissive. While Campion's themes have a tendency to bewilder, I found Holy Smoke to succeed where some of her other films may have not, largely due to Kate Winslet's character and the strong performances by the rest of the cast, as well as the enchanting, warm cinematography (Dion Beebe) throughout the film.A collection of Campion's shorts are available on the compilation titled (thought-provokingly enough) Jane Campion Shorts. If you find yourself attracted to Jane's present work, I recommend viewing her shorts, especially since it is uncommon to find most filmmaker's early work on tape. By the way, both Peel and The Piano won a Palm d'Or at Cannes, which just so happens to be the biggest gold star a filmmaker can ever receive.With Holy Smoke, Jane Campion has made another interesting piece of cinema. But beware, this is no light fodder. The film covers some fairly heavy territory that could well make you take a second look at yourself and the sordid relationship with your family that you would rather stick in a dark place. Nonetheless, if you would rather lay back and take in the beautiful backdrops of India and Australia, this is a fine film as well.

It became just the second film ever to win the five major Academy Awards and was shown in Swedish cinemas for 12 years, which remains a national record in Sweden. Yet at the time the critical reception of the movie was still rather uneven (though deservedly that's improved over time), and Kesey vehemently refused to watch it as the story wasn't told from the point of view of Chief Bromden like it is in the novel.But what a film it is. After fighting for more than a decade to get the film made, producers Saul Zaentz and Michael Douglas (largely influenced by his father Kirk, who first acquired the film rights) had developed a strong affection for the story and once they had the financing they hired Czech director Milos Forman, the only director they encountered who shared their affection for Kesey's story. It isn't hard to see why, and as Forman spent the majority of his formative years and the early part of his career living under a totalitarian regime in Czechoslovakia after losing his parents in Auschwitz and Buchenwald as a child, Forman proved to be the perfect director to bring to the screen this story of silenced and very often misunderstood people existing in such circumstances who are slowly inspired to take a stand. Forman's direction is a thing of sheer mastery tender yet honest in the sequences involving McMurphy's (Jack Nicholson) relationship with his fellow patients, raw in the sequences revolving around Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher), a usually calm but unknowingly corrupt and dictatorial woman who thinks she's doing what's in her patients' best interests and how she runs the ward and treats her patients, unflinching but sympathetic in its depiction of the ravages mental illnesses inflict on those who suffer from them, and all those qualities in the emotionally draining yet tremendously inspiring climax. Forman simply outdid himself here.But of course, every director is only as good (or bad) as the cast and crew they have to work with, and Forman's is flawless. Starting with the cast, he garners three of the most perfect displays of acting in cinematic history. McMurphy was the role Nicholson was born to play, and while he's a force of nature in the scenes involving McMurphy squaring off with Nurse Ratched, his more subtle scenes where he depicts the changes in him caused by the institution and his fellow patients in whom he provoked a change first are the ones that truly assure him a place among the true all-time legends (and the fact that he and Forman had a fiery relationship just makes his turn even more unbelievable). He's never been better before or since, and as brilliant as Al Pacino is in Dog Day Afternoon I'm firmly in Team McMurphy. Fletcher is every bit as good as the sadistic Nurse Ratched who tries to clip the free-spirited McMurphy's wings &#x96; it's an incredibly controlled performance, because while a lesser actress would have played her like an overbearing battleaxe, Fletcher is chilling because of her sincerity. Yet even despite how truly frightening Fletcher is she also manages to make the viewer feel a small amount of sympathy for Nurse Ratched by simultaneously playing her as a woman who's really just trying to do her job even though she's oblivious to the negative impact she's had on those in her care. Also, Brad Dourif pulls off one of the most astounding supporting turns in movie history as Billy Bibbitt, a stuttering (and thus exploited) teenager who proves to be the catalyst for Nurse Ratched's downfall at the hands of McMurphy, and William Redfield (who sadly died shortly after the movie was released) and Sydney Lassick are also superb as the schizophrenic Harding and bipolar Cheswick.Bo Goldman and Laurence Hauben's screenplay is one of the few that, I think it can be said, against which most others are measured. With great eloquence, insight, power and intelligence (and no cheese or sentimentality) they collectively crafted a screenplay that never waters down the ugly things that are mental illnesses, gives the viewer\/reader a greater understanding of the effects (both negative and also positive) they have on those who suffer from them and also what causes corruption, it celebrates the rebels of the world who fight the establishment for the greater good as well as themselves, and perhaps most importantly it shows the mentally ill not as not as complete caricatures (because often such depictions of the mentally ill are, it must be said, accurate ones), but as people who can achieve anything (even if they need a little guidance).Two other enormous bright spots are Jack Nitzsche's amazing score which is somehow mesmerizing in its musical simplicity (and it surely would've scooped the movie's sixth Oscar had Jaws come out in any other year) and Haskell Wexler's beautifully evocative cinematography.Countless similar films before and since have explored rebellion against corrupt authority figures and the inner workings of the human mind what makes us all tick, but One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest will forever be the cinematic depiction of life in a loony bin (as McMurphy puts it) to end them all. After more than thirty years it remains an absolutely flawless, definitive, knockout masterpiece, and one of the five most deserving Best Picture Oscar winners of all. And is that the greatest climax of a Best Picture winner ever or is that the greatest climax of a Best Picture winner ever?

It has won a whopping 88 awards, including, but not limited to five Oscars, one Grammy and 3 Golden Globes. It has been mentioned and spoofed in dozens of other movies, shows, cartoons and whatnot.

American Beauty centers around the typical American-dream-family Burnham, living in the suburbs of an unnamed, typical American city. Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey), the father of the family, is the main character and narrator of this movie. He is a 42 year old advertising agent, moaning about his boring, dull life. His wife Carolyn Burnham (Annette Bening) is an unsuccessful realtor, unhappy with her unused potential. And their 16-year-old daughter Jane (Thora Birch) coping with typical teenager problems like being embarrassed about her nerdy parents or uncertainty of life.As for the PLOT, Lester himself narrates his last days of his life post mortem, claiming he will be dead soon. In the beginning he is a self-proclaimed loser without any joy or excitement in his life. But this is about to change when he meets Janes friend Angela (Mena Suvari) and immediately has the hots for her. After overhearing a conversation between Angela and Jane, where Angela tells Jane her feelings about Lester (cute, but should work out a little), he is getting more self confident and starts changing his lifestyle by working out, buying a new car and smoking pot he buys from the boy next door. Meanwhile, Jane builds a relationship with this particular boy named Ricky Fits (Wes Bentley), who is filming her secretly through the bedroom window. Though Ricky is technically a voyeur, Jane starts to like him, because he is so different as he can see beauty in random things. And she happens to like people as different as she is, so these two end up being a couple.In the meantime Carolyn begins an affair with a business rival, Buddy Kane (Peter Gallagher) to satisfy her sexual needs. Few scenes later Kane breaks up with her again due to the expensive divorce he would have to pay for.Eventually, Colonel Frank Fits (Chris Cooper), Rickys father, suspects his son of having a relationship with Lester, because in one of his videos of Jane he captured Lester working out without wearing any clothes. Thinking Lester is homosexual, Frank kisses Lester, who of course rebuffs him, revealing the Colonel himself is homosexual.After that Lester and Angela finally come together and are about to get it on, when Angela confesses she is still a virgin. Lester doesn't seem to like this and instead wants to have a chat with her now about their personal problems. When Angela leaves for the bathroom, Lester gets shot from behind, while Carolyn is coming home, Jane and Ricky are upstairs in Janes room and Angela was in the bathroom. As it turns out, the Colonel was the one who murdered Lester, because he didn't fulfill the Colonel's homo-erotic desires. After his death, Lester recaps what happened in his life, coming to the conclusion, that it is hard to be mad, when there is so much beauty in the world.This covers the plot. But is it a good movie? Well, as bland as the story might look at first glance, it has actually some clever ideas. This movie deals with the problem a man can have in a midlife crisis, the American dream and homophobia, so there might be one or two lessons one could learn. But my problem is the credibility of this movie. There are just some unbelievable and unrealistic scenes that, I think, would never happen in real life. To tell just two of them. I just can't believe Jane falls in love with Ricky. Think about it, he was harassing her by filming her without her permission, day and night. That whole there is so much beauty in something. stuff is just a cheap excuse. And the second problem I have is why do Lester and Angela even come together?

Meanwhile, Jane builds a relationship with this particular boy named Ricky Fits (Wes Bentley), who is filming her secretly through the bedroom window. Though Ricky is technically a voyeur, Jane starts to like him, because he is so different as he can see beauty in random things. And she happens to like people as different as she is, so these two end up being a couple.In the meantime Carolyn begins an affair with a business rival, Buddy Kane (Peter Gallagher) to satisfy her sexual needs. Few scenes later Kane breaks up with her again due to the expensive divorce he would have to pay for.Eventually, Colonel Frank Fits (Chris Cooper), Rickys father, suspects his son of having a relationship with Lester, because in one of his videos of Jane he captured Lester working out without wearing any clothes. Thinking Lester is homosexual, Frank kisses Lester, who of course rebuffs him, revealing the Colonel himself is homosexual.After that Lester and Angela finally come together and are about to get it on, when Angela confesses she is still a virgin. Lester doesn't seem to like this and instead wants to have a chat with her now about their personal problems. When Angela leaves for the bathroom, Lester gets shot from behind, while Carolyn is coming home, Jane and Ricky are upstairs in Janes room and Angela was in the bathroom. As it turns out, the Colonel was the one who murdered Lester, because he didn't fulfill the Colonel's homo-erotic desires. After his death, Lester recaps what happened in his life, coming to the conclusion, that it is hard to be mad, when there is so much beauty in the world.This covers the plot. But is it a good movie? Well, as bland as the story might look at first glance, it has actually some clever ideas. This movie deals with the problem a man can have in a midlife crisis, the American dream and homophobia, so there might be one or two lessons one could learn. But my problem is the credibility of this movie. There are just some unbelievable and unrealistic scenes that, I think, would never happen in real life. To tell just two of them. I just can't believe Jane falls in love with Ricky. Think about it, he was harassing her by filming her without her permission, day and night. That whole there is so much beauty in something. stuff is just a cheap excuse. And the second problem I have is why do Lester and Angela even come together? I mean, Lester is playing with pedophilia here, and Angela even likes it. It's just weird.All in all, the movie is decent, it has it's illogical moments, but also smart, deep ones. Some might consider it funny, tragic, gross or boring. I think it is okay. And judging by the success the movie had many people have liked it.

It takes on some serious approaches and angles, that I suppose have a deeper feeling and meaning to it all. The story mostly evolves around the Mickey Rourke that is playing hard to get and likes to play games with the females that want him. Something that females normally would do in real life. The one moment they want you but the next they push you away. It leaves you craving for more, insecure and unsure about the whole situation. It's highly annoying when a woman does this, so it's kind of refreshing to see a man doing this to women for a change, though it still remains an annoying thing. Mickey Rourke plays this real slick playboy, that seems to know exactly what women want and what they are craving for. He approach them at the right times, say the right things and gives them just enough for them to want him badly but when they seem to completely surrender to him he alienates himself from them. This is what the movie is mostly about, though there is also a messy and uninteresting plot line in it about an old hotel.You could say that this movie is a rare mainstream soft erotic movie, with an actual big budget to spend and respectable actors in it. When approaching this movie purely as a more or less erotic movie you have to say that this movie is some of the best that the genre has to offer. Judging this movie as anything else really just makes it a really bad one.The movie and story at times have an almost surreal kind of look and feeling to it. It suits the sexual tensed atmosphere of the movie real well. The movie its feeling and atmosphere really reminded me of the last Kubrick movie Eyes Wide Shut.The movie had a great look to it and its sex scenes were shot really well.

He and his wife writer Patricia Louisianna Knop (really, these two weird named persons truly fit together) are perhaps best known of the Red Shoe Diaries series fame, that is about the best known, classy looking, soft erotic TV\/movie series that is around.The movie does not have the best acting in it that you will ever see, despite having some big names in its cast.

Someone's been watching too many 1950's sitcoms, and woe betide anyone who doesn't fit into that image of perfection! After the death of her father one year ago, Stephanie Maine (Jill Schoelen) has been getting into a lot of trouble at school. Part of the reason she's like this is that she's creeped out by her all-too-perfect step-dad, Jerry Blake (Terry O'Quinn). Everyone, especially her mother (Shelley Hack), thinks he's the ideal family man, but Stephanie knows better.Although there is no real humor in this film (there's a clever one liner, but it's not especially funny, nor is it meant to be), this is a satire of the American Family Ideal. You know what I mean, a white picket fence, a mom and a dad, 2.5 kids, and a dog and a cat. No one really has this, and if they do, it's never the image that is portrayed in magazine ads. Unfortunately, no one told this to Jerry. He wants that so-called perfect family. At first, he seems like a godsend. But if that image is shaken, then he becomes the step-dad from hell.The premise is sound, but it's the execution that's lacking. The pacing is erratic, and the set-up is non-existent. We never get a sense of who Jerry is. To be sure, we know he's a psychopath (this is, after all, a horror movie). But there's little showing of how he wants his family to be. A thriller needs this kind of thing to give us a sense of the psychopath we are dealing with.Apart from O'Quinn, who is very good, the acting varies. Jill Schoelen has moments of believability, but others where her performance doesn't work. Likewise, Shelley Hack is never believable. And both of them are guilty of doing some really stupid things (then again, this is a horror movie). Charles Lanyer is good as Stephanie's therapist who goes above and beyond the call of duty (not in the way you'd think, though). However, Stephen Shellen is horrible as David Ogilvie, the man who's racing against time to find Jerry before he slaughters his next family.Joseph Rueben's direction is plastic. There's nothing special about how this film looks or how the story is told. It's a point and shoot approach, and that leaves it up to the actors (specifically O'Quinn) to induce suspense.
