It's so well re-enacted and so graphic that it truly does give the viewer a taste (but only a taste) of the insanity and sheer violence of war. It's a taste. I was comfortably sitting in my living room watching this. I don't claim to have been able to fully (or even remotely) understand what the soldiers in the midst of the battle were feeling. But it is a taste. Well done, and very sobering. It has to be one of the best battle re-enactments I've ever seen in a movie. As well done as it was, though, it wasn't the depiction of the battle that made this work. One gets desensitized after a while. The sheer scale of the carnage being depicted is overwhelming and from time to time my mind just left the screen as if I needed a break from it. So if this had been all about the battle it wouldn't have been nearly as effective as it was. What made this work was the very effective interweaving of so many very human elements to the story above and beyond just the depiction of the battle. These were, indeed, soldiers, but they were more than soldiers. They were real people, with wives and children and friends back home. Real people with lives that went far beyond what they did on the battlefield. Real people that we cared about because we learned of their lives and of how much reason they had to live and of how tragic it was that so many of them died.The human elements of the story were shown in many ways. Although sometimes long introductions to a story bother me, I appreciated the somewhat lengthy introduction to this movie. After a brief look at the French experience in Vietnam, the movie shifts to a U.S. Army base where a new division is being put together to go to Vietnam and engage the enemy. We see the unit being formed. We meet the men - more importantly, we meet their families. It was a great way of drawing us into their stories; of reminding us that these were real life flesh and blood men, and not just destined to be battlefield casualty statistics. Later, after deployment and as the battle heats up, we're drawn into the anguish of the families as telegrams are delivered, telling wives that their husbands had been killed - telegrams originally delivered by taxi cab drivers because the Army wasn't ready with chaplains, until the wife of the commanding officer takes over the job of going door to door to break the news. I was impressed by the depiction of the North Vietnamese. They weren't depicted as evil; they weren't caricatured. They were the enemy - but only because this was war. They were soldiers, too - with people who loved them; a point brilliantly made by the use of one Vietnamese soldiers' notebook (eventually picked up by the Americans) that contained a picture of his sweetheart. And, in the end, the movie is clearly shown to be not about war, but about the relationship between the men, as we see Col. Moore's anguish at the loss of so many soldiers and his relief at returning home, and as the point is made that these men didn't fight so much for their country - they fought more for each other.Mel Gibson I thought pulled off the role of Col. Moore quite well fiercely devoted to his men, and as commander of the 7th Cavalry determined to avoid the fate that had befallen the commander and troops of a previous 7th Cavalry - Custer at the Little Big Horn. That was an interesting connection that was made several times in the movie. This is a very good war movie, made even better by the fact that it's about more than war - it's about the people who fought and lived and died together, and about the people back home who loved them.

It's unlike any film I've seen before, and because of that, I commend it for not searching for a blueprint or a formula to tell its story. Tarantino tells the story from pure originality, and like many of his future films, Pulp Fiction is told with a non-linear narrative making it hard to explain the plot. It's better to just introduce the characters and go from there.The story is about very different people whose lives intertwine with one another over the course of a few days. The characters first introduced are Pumpkin (Roth) and Honey Bunny (Plummer) who are talking in a dinner with plans to conduct a heist. We then cut to two detectives named Vincent Vega (Travolta) and Jules Winnfield (Jackson) who are trying to retrieve a briefcase they can bring to their boss Marsellus Wallace (Rhames).Wallace has his own chapter in the film as well. Him and prizefighter Butch Coolidge (Willis) strike a deal where Butch accepts a large amount of money to throw an upcoming fight. While Wallace is tied up in this deal, Vega goes over to meet and take to dinner the lovely Mrs. Mia Wallace (Thurman). A series of events happen, causing dismay among Vega which lead to some very well-written and well-acted sequences.Being that the film is conducted in a very nontraditional style, Pulp Fiction is a task to follow sometimes. My advice; watch it and just go along with it. If you feel inclined to look up how it played out on the internet go ahead, or if you want to give it a rewatch that is fine too. Viewing multiple clips for a second time, I think I finally understand it more, but a lot of questions you'll still be asking after repeated viewings.One of the most famous questions is what's in the briefcase? that is recovered by Vega and Winnfield in the early scenes of the film. I'm sure when writing the film Tarantino himself didn't know what he wanted to put in the briefcase. I'm also sure he didn't think it would blow up into such a debacle on the message boards and through word of mouth.What truly makes Pulp Fiction worthwhile is the genius dialog. Tarantino cranks out the best script possible combined with enough wit and violence to please the most demanding and picky action-film fan. One moment the two are discussing why a Quarter Pounder With Cheese from McDonalds is called a Royale With Cheese in France. Next, they are threatening violence if a victim asks the question what? again.Why do I not condone constant swearing and gratuitous violence in other films, but for some reason award a perfect score to a film that is made up of it? Because Pulp Fiction shows how it should be done. It depicts realistic situations, handled intelligently and with wit and soul. It doesn't utilize them for the purpose of being monotonous or dreary, but to advance an already crafty storyline. The character are under such stress it only makes sense that they are constantly shouting four letter words. Is it necessary? Not really. But Pulp Fiction isn't just about swearing. It proves that true cinema still exists and that even a story that appears choppy and inconsistent on paper can still produce one of the best films of the decade.Starring John Travolta, Samuel L.

Can they break out while their jailers are watching their every move ?A great international co-production, this classic wartime escape drama is one of the best films of the sixties and one of the most entertaining ensemble casts in any movie. I particularly like the mix of nationalities in both the cast and characters, and everybody is terrific in it, right down to the smallest part. McQueen and Attenborough, as the epitome of American Cool and British Stiff Upper Lip respectively, were both never better, but the real stars for me are Pleasence as Blythe, the genial forger who gradually realises he's going blind, and Bronson as Danny, the Polish tunnel king with a painful secret behind his tough guy persona. Everybody works together brilliantly, often in unlikely pairings, and despite its three-hour length the movie never seems languid or dull. The men are so well observed and the drama unfolds in a way which is both realistic but also consistently amusing and exciting. It's also one of those rare Hollywood blockbusters which doesn't cop out at the end; we want the heroes to escape so badly, yet only misery and death await so many of them. After his phenomenal success with The Magnificent Seven, Sturges turns in another masterful epic adventure film, brimming with suspense, humour and pathos. Elmer Bernstein's sweeping score, with its irresistibly catchy main theme, is simply brilliant - a great brassy fanfare of music and the perfect accompaniment to the action. Equally impressive is the editing by old pro Ferris Webster, which takes what on paper are hours and hours of stodgy dialogue scenes and somehow turns them into nail-biting intrigue. Extremely well written by W.R. Burnett and James Clavell, from a book by Paul Brickhill, based on his real-life experiences in Stammlager Luft POW camp in Silesia\/Poland.

Can they break out while their jailers are watching their every move ?A great international co-production, this classic wartime escape drama is one of the best films of the sixties and one of the most entertaining ensemble casts in any movie. I particularly like the mix of nationalities in both the cast and characters, and everybody is terrific in it, right down to the smallest part. McQueen and Attenborough, as the epitome of American Cool and British Stiff Upper Lip respectively, were both never better, but the real stars for me are Pleasence as Blythe, the genial forger who gradually realises he's going blind, and Bronson as Danny, the Polish tunnel king with a painful secret behind his tough guy persona. Everybody works together brilliantly, often in unlikely pairings, and despite its three-hour length the movie never seems languid or dull. The men are so well observed and the drama unfolds in a way which is both realistic but also consistently amusing and exciting. It's also one of those rare Hollywood blockbusters which doesn't cop out at the end; we want the heroes to escape so badly, yet only misery and death await so many of them. After his phenomenal success with The Magnificent Seven, Sturges turns in another masterful epic adventure film, brimming with suspense, humour and pathos. Elmer Bernstein's sweeping score, with its irresistibly catchy main theme, is simply brilliant - a great brassy fanfare of music and the perfect accompaniment to the action. Equally impressive is the editing by old pro Ferris Webster, which takes what on paper are hours and hours of stodgy dialogue scenes and somehow turns them into nail-biting intrigue. Extremely well written by W.R. Burnett and James Clavell, from a book by Paul Brickhill, based on his real-life experiences in Stammlager Luft POW camp in Silesia\/Poland.

It looks beautiful. Having only seen it in the early 90s on a run-of-the-mill videotape that was probably pan and scan and full of color and toning problems, it truly is a different experience on blu ray.The brutally honest performances, visionary aesthetic and the beautiful style make Blue Velvet an absolutely unmissable film and a wonderful addition to Blu Ray. Despite the films fame and notoriety, all these years later, the film still seems completely original, invigorating and unsurpassed. Everyone assumes that Blue Velvet opens with the infamous ear-in-the-grass scene, but the film's opening is even more disturbing than that. A suburban fantasia of white picket fences, blood-red roses, waving fireman, happy children and a man watering his lawn gives way to the disturbing moment when the watering man collapses and the camera pans down to dirt level where a number of horrific insects are scrabbling in the dirt at the base of the lawn. The soundtrack changes from Leave It to Beaver-style music to the loud, gnawing, electric saw-like noises emitted by the creatures. Only subsequent to this scene does Jeffrey Beaumont (a wide-eyed, snoopy Kyle MacLachlan) find the ear in a field of overgrown weeds. The ear leads Jeffrey through a sordid underworld involving kidnapping, masochism, drug- dealing, and murder. But while there's a whole lot of plot in Blue Velvet, Lynch's more elemental concern is with unearthing the truth behind the facade (i.e. showing what lurks under the lawn). Even the blue velvet dress that chanteuse Dorothy Valens (Isabella Rossellini) wears hides a secret &#x97; namely, the bruises on her body which are delivered by the vile Frank Booth (Dennis Hopper, in the role that brought him back to the limelight). When Jeffrey asks the naive Sandy (Laura Dern), the prim girl on whom he has a crush, why there is so much trouble in the world, the answer is clear &#x97; without it, our lives would be far duller. Jeffrey himself admits that he loves a mystery and the curiosity that his desire entails is the same one that fuels Lynch's own vision. When Frank says to Jeffrey, You're like me, it could be Lynch speaking to the audience. We want to know more, even if what we find out hurts or is ugly. Like the scene of an accident, we cannot look away. Fueled by a vibrant and always-surprising dream like surrealism, Blue Velvet reminds us that the dreams and fantasies of our subconscious are dangerous and thrilling; it's surface reality that is superficial and mundane. This is definitely a film worth watching multiple times. It gets better and better on every viewing. There are so many questions, and at the same time, so many answers, which seem to bring up more questions. Blue Velvet is a timeless film and it looks absolutely superb on Blu Ray. I will happily get lost in this film from time and time again, it's absolutely remarkable. 10\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"24 November 2011","score":"26 out of 34 people found the following review useful","review":" I just want to say that I fell in love with this film after seeing the 25th anniversary edition blu ray.
