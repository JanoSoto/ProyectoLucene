The script is smart with breathless succession (It's written by John Pogue who wrote U.S. Marshals, a very good action thriller, 2 years earlier). I love (Rob Cohen)'s work in anything. He nails the right way to tighten things on screen, with all the senses of the word. The humid colors, the narrow cadres, the hot pace&#x85;etc. they are all his elements to make an exciting time. This movie is no exception. But why I felt that it was like fancy dinner party with only cheap rusk to serve ! (Joshua Jackson) can't be the lead. He's uncharismatic and uninteresting to the max. Among the ones chosen for the skulks who were entering the center for the first time\/namely the movie's extra, he was the least noticeable. I'm no fan of (Tom Cruise) but the young him should have been more fit for such a role (a la he did in The Firm once). Further, although looks are deceiving but by a look to the movie's poster you'll grasp that (Paul Walker) was catchier than (Jackson). It's an irony wasn't for the sake of the lead, his persuasion, or our interaction with him.(Hill Harper), as the friend, is one annoying actor who many viewers thank god that he got killed earlier in the movie. He was in bad corner too concerning the way his role was written. The character, so hastily, hates how his friend becomes a Skull, for no logical reason (I got the feeling that he was gay, loving his roommate secretly, refusing that he goes to another class and another friend !). As you see the bad writing perfected with the bad acting to produce something between bad and laughable !(Steve Harris) as Detective Sparrow was a joke. He looked like another student yet fatter, doing his job usually or badly ! Long story short, save the old actors (Craig T. Nelson and William Petersen), this movie has a major casting, and acting, problems. But maybe it was all due to a lack of budget. Notice well that there was no sex scene between the lead and his love, since &#x96; naturally &#x96; there are no bankable stars in the first place. So, it tells you that (Rob Cohen) wanted to make this movie anyway, despite the small production, and with small stars. Yes, the presence, or not, of sex or nude scene can tell you a lot about a movie's production these days !The emphasis on the yellow color was terrible. I know that (Rob Cohen) wants us to live that sick phase of the lead's life, however not to the extent of making us sick ourselves! I noticed that many directors many times intend to use this color in specific exaggeratedly in their movies or TV shows lately. Is it a way to prove how artistic their work is? Is it a way to cut down the budget ? Is it a way to hide defects in the image ? I really don't know. What I do know is too much of something is bad enough !Generally, it's a very good thriller with different atmosphere and major casting problem maybe caused by the budget. I wanted to say to hell with the big names, but this cast forbids me. It's obvious that The Skulls just needed more skills to be more effective and, why not, believable.

Each scene is very busy with so many people; your eyes do not know where to look first. It is almost as if it is too many stories in one film. All the the sets of the film were rather beautiful. In the city of Casablanca there are stone sidewalks, and dim lights. Ricks Café and the Blue Parrot are just two of the many cool places to be in Casablanca. The characters also fit in well with the story. Although I did not care much for Ilsa. This is because it always seemed as though she wanted to have her cake and eat it too. She was married to a caring and loyal man, and she decides to cheat on him with the mysterious Rick. For this reason I very much so enjoy the ending when Rick forces Ilsa to go on the plane with her husband. We expected the opposite out of such a suave love story. For being known as a classic I truthfully expected more out of this film.

Well, History of the World Part I begins with cavemen waking up and humping air for what feels like a solid 2 minutes. This is his Dawn of Man segment, a vague parody of Kubrick's 2001, before he moves on to The Stone Age during which the first art critic is sent up, and then mocks Moses in an Old Testament sketch, which is essentially a single joke that we fade into and out of that quickly. Where Brooks really goes to town is during The Roman Empire. He stars as a stand-up philosopher who, along with a black slave played by Gregory Hines and a defiant vestal virgin, brings pandemonium to the court of the extraordinarily hilarious Emperor Nero, in one of Dom DeLuise's most memorable performances, and Madeleine Kahn, his nymphomaniac empress.We're actually surprised when the movie moves on, because it seems to have decided to develop some semblance of a story there, unlike its preceding episodes. But it does, and Brooks again takes center stage as Torquemada, who celebrates his ecstatic pleasure in torturing Jews who reject Christianity in a Busby Berkeley tableau abounding with melody, singing, and a water ballet. Oh, and a funny little aside elucidates some unanswered questions about how Leonardo Da Vinci painted the Last Supper. Ultimately, Harvey Korman steals the spotlight from Brooks, as per usual, in an absurd caricature of The French Revolution. Korman plays foppish nobleman Count De Monet, who turns up with a cunning plot to save King Louis XVI from death at the hands of the mob by switching the King's lowly doppelganger on the crucial occasion.This is an incoherent, disorderly, sometimes awkward romp by one of the most talented comic filmmakers, who never seems to have a clear idea of the underlying principle of his seventh film escapade, so there's no assertive narrative incentive to bear it along. His historical context doesn't have any method or perspective. It's basically just an assembly line for whatever jokes he can sling on it. What is this off-the-wall grab bag? Is it a lampoon of old Biblical, Roman and French historical epics? From time to time. Is it a never-to-be-repeated, comedy vaudeville seizure? Now and then. Is it a send-up trained at haughty foils? Every so often. But generally it's in essence simply valuable sets standing there expecting Brooks to do something comical before them.Synchronously with Woody Allen, Brooks has helped sustain the comedy genre in contemporary films. As Allen has turned increasingly sophisticated and contemplative, Brooks has gotten increasingly campy and preposterous, the politically incorrect auteur and effortless ham actor's rudimentary oomph let loose flat out with this outrageous 1981 package picture, in which---rather than taking razor-sharp bites out of status quo mythologies and nostalgic legends as he did with his crowning achievements Blazing Saddles and Young Frankenstein---he indulges in our incessant need for mocking the sort of unconsciously class-based theories of manners and good form that inadvertently made burlesque all the rage in its puritan heyday. As in all movies by the ambitious Brooks, there are dull patches where the farce and the gags just don't work. But hit-or-miss is his style, so when he does hit, he hits the bullseye.

It stars Lukas Haas, Len Cariou, Alex Rocco, and Katherine Helmond.Lady In White arrived to no great fanfare in 1988, it got a limited release in theatres and promptly vanished from the public view. However, it did find a cult following thanks to the burgeoning success of the VHS home format. It seemed that, for home viewings at least, there was a market for a good old fashioned ghost story with a mystery killer kicker at its core. 1988 was the year that cash cow blood movies really started to bang the horror fans over the head. There were sequels for Elm Street, Critters, Friday the 13th, Fright Night, Hellraiser, Halloween, Poltergeist, Phantasm, Living Dead and Killer Tomatoes. But in amongst all that grue and lazy film making were two smart atmospheric movies splicing fantasy realms with their horror. One was the magnificent Paperhouse, the other was of course Lady In White.It would be foolish of me to claim that Lady In White is flawless because that simply isn't the case, the rubbish score and its budgetary restrictions mean it simply hasn't aged as well as the afore mentioned Paperhouse. Suffice to say this isn't a film for everyone, and certainly not for those who drooled spittle over Halloween 4 The Return of Michael Myers or Friday the 13th Part VII The New Blood. But LaLoggia's ambition and genuine affection for his story lifts this far above many of 1988's tepid releases.Plot sees Lukas Haas play Frankie, a young boy who as part of a bully prank gets locked in the school cloak-room on Halloween night 1962. Whilst there he observes the ghostly apparition of a young girl, from where he then learns how she sadly became a ghost in the first place. First as he witnesses her murder, then as he is attacked by the unknown assailant who has returned to the cloak-room for some incriminating evidence he left behind. Surviving the attack (one of the film's itchy flaws since the killer must closely know him to let him live), Frankie embarks upon a mission to uncover the story behind the little girl's murder. It's a story that involves ghosts wandering around searching for closure, a serial child killer and the potentially wrongful incarceration of the school's black janitor. All of which is set in the delightfully named Willowpoint Falls; which by day has ethereal charm, but by night oozes with creepy hues.It's using this home town feel of small Americana that gives the film its solid base to build from. LaLoggia knows that we have seen all too many ghost stories framed around the creepy mansion formula, so he sets this up in and around an everyday life that most can identify with. This Capraesque type town has a very human feel to it, thus the dark secrets that unravel gain added chills. It's an approach that David Koepp's criminally undervalued Stir Of Echoes would harness in 1999. LaLoggia's movie also benefits from strong performances from the principal actors, with Haas (unassuming with commonsense child mannerisms) & Rocco (emotionally tortured but stoic father) playing out two of the best turns in the horror calendar year.Guessing the killer isn't hard, and in fact he shows up rather too early. While the motive(s) for the monstrous acts that are committed here are never given (he just does it it seems). But this is a clever and well made film. The monsters lay not with the ghosts that glide in and out of Frankie's life, but in the maniac that kills children and the racist undertones that bubbles behind the surface of Willowpoint Falls' pretty facade. Factors that sadly over 30 years on still trouble society greatly. 7.5\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"20 October 2010","score":"4 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" Lady in White is directed, produced & written by Frank LaLoggia.

Whilst there he observes the ghostly apparition of a young girl, from where he then learns how she sadly became a ghost in the first place. First as he witnesses her murder, then as he is attacked by the unknown assailant who has returned to the cloak-room for some incriminating evidence he left behind. Surviving the attack (one of the film's itchy flaws since the killer must closely know him to let him live), Frankie embarks upon a mission to uncover the story behind the little girl's murder. It's a story that involves ghosts wandering around searching for closure, a serial child killer and the potentially wrongful incarceration of the school's black janitor. All of which is set in the delightfully named Willowpoint Falls; which by day has ethereal charm, but by night oozes with creepy hues.It's using this home town feel of small Americana that gives the film its solid base to build from. LaLoggia knows that we have seen all too many ghost stories framed around the creepy mansion formula, so he sets this up in and around an everyday life that most can identify with. This Capraesque type town has a very human feel to it, thus the dark secrets that unravel gain added chills. It's an approach that David Koepp's criminally undervalued Stir Of Echoes would harness in 1999. LaLoggia's movie also benefits from strong performances from the principal actors, with Haas (unassuming with commonsense child mannerisms) & Rocco (emotionally tortured but stoic father) playing out two of the best turns in the horror calendar year.Guessing the killer isn't hard, and in fact he shows up rather too early. While the motive(s) for the monstrous acts that are committed here are never given (he just does it it seems). But this is a clever and well made film. The monsters lay not with the ghosts that glide in and out of Frankie's life, but in the maniac that kills children and the racist undertones that bubbles behind the surface of Willowpoint Falls' pretty facade. Factors that sadly over 30 years on still trouble society greatly. 7.5\/10 ","genre":"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"},{"date":"20 October 2010","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" I honestly did not like this movie.

Some films become more appreciated as time goes on. Some films that are initially hailed, suffer as they are reevaluated over time. The Wild Bunch is an unusual case. The things that garnered it such praise when it was first released no longer have much salience, but the fading of that hype and sensation hasn't hurt the movie at all. The passage of time has revealed it to be a very good story on a basic level.The Wild Bunch is about a gang of outlaws that has managed to fight and rob and kill all the way past the end of the Wild West era. They're still riding horses and robbing railroad company offices as automobiles and planes begin to spread across the world, as semi-automatic pistols and machine guns take the place of revolvers and rifles, as War threatens in Europe and Pancho Villa leads his rebels in Mexico. The gang is lead by Pike (William Holden), a smart man who can feel age sapping away the strength that used to carry him through life. Pike and some of the rest of his gang are looking for one more big score, so they can retire to a life of at least mediocre leisure . That big score isn't their latest robbery of a railroad office, though. That's an ambush that leaves several of the gang dead and the rest with nothing to show for their efforts. In addition, the railroad has freed Pike's former partner, Thornton (Robert Ryan), from prison. The railroad puts Thornton in charge of a posse of human scum and sends them after Pike's gang. Pike leads his gang into Mexico, where they encounter a general who gives them a chance for that one more big score. The gang is to steal weapons for the general from a U.S. Army train in exchange for 10,000 dollars in gold. But even though Thornton is able to anticipate or figure out everything Pike and his gang are planning, it's not the robbery that causes them any trouble. When one of the gang members, Angel (Jaime Sanchez), is taken prisoner by the general for Angel's work helping Mexican rebels, Pike and his men have to make a decision. They can take the money, abandon their compatriot and live. Or they can decide that there are some things they can't live with anymore.When the Wild Bunch first hit theaters, what caused a commotion was the level of graphic violence in the picture. When people get shot in this Western, they spurt blood and slow motion captures their death spasms. And they don't just get shot once, it might take two or three or six bullets to bring them down. And the final battle where dozens and dozens are killed by machine guns and grenades was pretty far beyond anything expected in the Western genre. Of course, all of that stuff is hardly shocking or that noteworthy by today's movie violence standards. Peckinpah's skill at portraying violence as chaos and frenzy is still striking. There's none of the careful and obvious choreography in his killings that you find so often in modern films. But while Peckinpah's bloodbaths were almost unprecedented in their day, it's all rather tame to anyone who's seen everything from Jaws to The Terminator to Saving Private Ryan.While its cutting edge has dulled, The Wild Bunch remains a really good movie. Holden gives a strong performance as a man who knows he's outlived his time, but still hopes for an ending he won't regret. Ernest Borgnine and Edmond O'Brien are also quite good as Pike's closest friends, O'Brien as the weak, old man that Holden could degenerate into and Borgnine as the contemporary who doesn't really understand the outlaw days are over. Robert Ryan is equally fine as a badman who's been caught and won't let himself go back to prison, even though he's disgusted and outraged at the behavior and attitudes of his law abiding masters and fellow bounty hunters.The plot is also imaginative, fast moving and realistic, for the most part. The action scenes are compelling and the story doesn't bog down in between, but it still takes time to let these characters show you who they are so the movie doesn't have to stop and tell you.Before I watched it, I remember hearing about The Wild Bunch as one of those Westerns that deconstructed the genre. But I don't think that's fundamentally true. Yes, the movie is much more realistic about the violence, sex, poverty, hardship and depravity of the Wild West. Yet in the end it embraces the conventions of the Western instead of exploding them. The Western was never really about its unrealistic clichés of shooting guns out of people's hand or singing cowboys and what not. They were stories defined and bounded by concepts of honor and right and wrong. They were stories of men choosing to do what they thought was right instead of what was easy. They were characters and adventures that may not have been true to their time period, but they were true to the way we wish the world would be.

","genre":"Horror"},{"date":"20 October 2010","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Annie invites Alvy up to her apartment for the first time. They have a drink and chat. Subtitles tell us what each person's thinking throughout. We see that what they're saying is not what they're thinking. More particularly, because they're essentially preoccupied with impressing each other and forming a new relationship, we see a dialogue wherein they're both too engrossed in assessing their own performance to totally partake. They censure what they're saying as they're saying it, and accordingly, their actual interaction becomes practically hollow. What makes this scene hilarious is the incongruity between what both people are saying and what they're thinking. Normally, we don't get such an advantaged spy-hole on a conversation. And watching this scene, we become conscious that these discrepancies between thought and speech surface along with the prospect of romance. The deeper connotation's that romantic relationships are somehow very different from friendly ones, that romantic ones characteristically involve deception on some level.Alvy ruminates on his elementary school days, where there's an off-the-wall incorporation of the present with the past. We hear him narrate about his class as we watch the action. At some point though, the adult Alvy steps into the scene, intermingles with the children and teacher of his past, who then act like they're living in the present along with him. The wittiness here's rooted in the peculiar temporal absurdities regarding him and his classmates, who are hilariously children and adults simultaneously. And it nurtures vital issues about the connection between our childhood and adult actions, between genetics and culture in shaping behavior. When we hear the kids talking about what they've become as grown-ups, we instantly start to laugh in wonder at how they got from this to that. How do innocent seven-year-old children, with like cultural backgrounds, grow up to be so different from each other? What inborn temperaments and fusion of occurrences in their lives led to such wide-ranging identities? Allen proposes no answers for these questions, but he undoubtedly instills these uncertainties. They encompass the background feel for the rest of the film. To be sure, one of the key ideas of Annie Hall is our powerlessness to ever get a thorough grasp of how and why people change. Periodically, we're offered self-spoofing philosophical masturbation about this multifaceted subject, but never are we given an ultimate resolution of it. The insinuation's that we may never have a complete one.Like Seinfeld, Annie Hall taps reflexive humor from everyday occasions quarrelling about whether it's tolerable to enter a movie after it's begun; withstanding tedious cocktail parties. I can conceive of George relating to Alvy's slant on romance He doesn't want a woman who'd want him. And mightn't Kramer have been disheartened as a kid over the expansion of the universe? Why does dialogue always seem more real in Woody Allen films? Because he doesn't begin conversations with someone arriving, end with them leaving, transposing trite formula onto an otherwise good story. Instead, it works to conceive variations, opening scenes in the middle of things, ending dialogues without prolonging them, without people straining to bring things to a finish. He keeps characters' words from delineating the sense of opening and closure. As well, many comedians kill jokes by giving too much or little information that gives us our grasp, or by either hastening or prolonging the pace of the information delivery. Consciously setting us up to laugh needs a sharp familiarity with a scenario, including delicate particulars about the vibes and expectations of an audience, then making them abruptly conscious of an unanticipated change, such that some initial notions about the situation are spontaneously changed.Slimly built, anxious, rambling, bespectacled, wildly gesturing, highly strung, and a ceaseless wit, Woody as an actor is both familiar and personal, and with her ditzy proclivity for men's clothing, WASPy background and airy exhortations, fish-in-the-Manhattan-sea Annie is the spot-on counterpoint to Alvy's Jewish NYC valetudinarian. Though she's remembered more for her fickle naivete, it's Annie's obscurely morose tendencies---she requires pot to take pleasure in sex, her analyst proposes five sessions a week---that gives her profundity. And what gets us stuck on her is the breezy sweetness, idiosyncratic beauty and natural comic timing of Keaton herself. Whether she's playing herself or a variation on herself or what Woody envisioned, it's all her. Even that iconic look. And yet the word I believe best describes her performance is effortless. She simply doesn't hide her reactions, doesn't seem to have a fixed Method-style concentration on character, motivation. She's just herself in 1977.Allen uses broad comedy, breaking the fourth wall and even a cartoon sequence to break comic distance and allow us to see from Alvy's point-of-view. It's an unassumingly compelling vehicle for imparting philosophically valuable ideas, highlighting unanticipated incongruities in each scene, using them to reap fresh thematic understanding. Joking's not subject to the same criticism as other exchange of ideas, and this makes it viable to persuade the audience to consider thoughtful subjects generally not dealt with. In so many scenes, nearly every one, Allen draws on absurdist humor straightforwardly to broach fascinating theoretical doubts, and gets the audience to contemplate them. Indeed, it's repeatedly the case that the raising of such questions is a central part of the film's subject matter.Creating a stream-of-consciousness narrative, Allen uses an intellectual style of editing, but also a buildup of cutting based on the mind's distortion of time, multifaceted visual arrangements and stage-managed chronological length of shots to fuse the film's effect on us for a more concentrated, conceptual effect than eliciting our most straightforward, reactive sleepwalk through a standard formula. At the end, we're left with more questions about subjects like love than we had at the start of the film. It looks to be Allen's aim to point up that there are no simple answers to particular crucial questions about life, to cultivate our understanding of the complexities involved in grasping such complicated matters.

They have a drink and chat. Subtitles tell us what each person's thinking throughout. We see that what they're saying is not what they're thinking. More particularly, because they're essentially preoccupied with impressing each other and forming a new relationship, we see a dialogue wherein they're both too engrossed in assessing their own performance to totally partake. They censure what they're saying as they're saying it, and accordingly, their actual interaction becomes practically hollow. What makes this scene hilarious is the incongruity between what both people are saying and what they're thinking. Normally, we don't get such an advantaged spy-hole on a conversation. And watching this scene, we become conscious that these discrepancies between thought and speech surface along with the prospect of romance. The deeper connotation's that romantic relationships are somehow very different from friendly ones, that romantic ones characteristically involve deception on some level.Alvy ruminates on his elementary school days, where there's an off-the-wall incorporation of the present with the past. We hear him narrate about his class as we watch the action. At some point though, the adult Alvy steps into the scene, intermingles with the children and teacher of his past, who then act like they're living in the present along with him. The wittiness here's rooted in the peculiar temporal absurdities regarding him and his classmates, who are hilariously children and adults simultaneously. And it nurtures vital issues about the connection between our childhood and adult actions, between genetics and culture in shaping behavior. When we hear the kids talking about what they've become as grown-ups, we instantly start to laugh in wonder at how they got from this to that. How do innocent seven-year-old children, with like cultural backgrounds, grow up to be so different from each other? What inborn temperaments and fusion of occurrences in their lives led to such wide-ranging identities? Allen proposes no answers for these questions, but he undoubtedly instills these uncertainties. They encompass the background feel for the rest of the film. To be sure, one of the key ideas of Annie Hall is our powerlessness to ever get a thorough grasp of how and why people change. Periodically, we're offered self-spoofing philosophical masturbation about this multifaceted subject, but never are we given an ultimate resolution of it. The insinuation's that we may never have a complete one.Like Seinfeld, Annie Hall taps reflexive humor from everyday occasions quarrelling about whether it's tolerable to enter a movie after it's begun; withstanding tedious cocktail parties. I can conceive of George relating to Alvy's slant on romance He doesn't want a woman who'd want him. And mightn't Kramer have been disheartened as a kid over the expansion of the universe? Why does dialogue always seem more real in Woody Allen films? Because he doesn't begin conversations with someone arriving, end with them leaving, transposing trite formula onto an otherwise good story. Instead, it works to conceive variations, opening scenes in the middle of things, ending dialogues without prolonging them, without people straining to bring things to a finish. He keeps characters' words from delineating the sense of opening and closure. As well, many comedians kill jokes by giving too much or little information that gives us our grasp, or by either hastening or prolonging the pace of the information delivery.
