I don't know if the director\/writer Gregory Poirier is sick or deeply messed up sexually, but I doubt that a normal person could have made a movie like this. I could probably have taken it if it was just that, if the only thing that was wrong was it was that it required a tough stomach... but it isn't. The film is also horribly mean-spirited and disturbing... every single character that has more than one full second of time on-screen is an extreme... sexually, mentally or physically. I don't know if this is just the director's sense of humor, but I just found it to be... wrong. Just wrong. Even in a comedy, there is supposed to be some seriousness. The plot is stupid. The acting is bad. The characters are inconsistent and poorly written... all of them. There isn't one single likable character in the film. The humor is disgusting and goes way too far. The film is just so incredibly poorly done that I really don't think it's worth anyone's time. If you like R-rated, crude comedies with plenty of sexual innuendo and graphic stuff, watch The Groomsmen, or, better yet, American Pie... or Road Trip, my personal favorite. But don't watch this. I can't possibly describe to you how bad it is... you would have to experience it for yourself. However, this is one of those times where I'll say that you're better off wondering. That way you can just imagine that this film goes very close to the bottom... without knowing that it goes through it, and far lower than that. This movie most of all looks like a group of horny teenage guys got together, put together a film crew, and every-time one of them got an idea, they filmed it, and later put the entire thing together. It lacks structure, consistency and taste. I recommend this only to horny teenage guys who have seen every single other R-rated crude teen comedy and who don't care about quality. Everyone else... do the sensible thing; avoid this. It's not even worth it to see the booty.

I know Crowe likes music but try to keep it subtle.The cast does a good enough job, but I think Cruise has it tough - he's just not convincing enough, he's kind of playing himself half the time, then hamming it up the rest of the time. Diaz, Cruz and Russell are OK, I like Lee but the part's not right for him. And Noah Taylor is almost the downfall of the entire film for me. He was just so stilted, but his character was so important to the last twenty minutes or so, he made me want to switch it off.

Some of them know each other from before and some of them don't, but the one thing they've got in common is that they're excellent thieves in their own fields... The only one who differs form the others is Dean Keaton (Gabriel Byrne); a former thief, according to himself, who wants to go straight.. However, he is talked into joining the others in what's supposed to be one, single operation.. (By the by, this sounds very familiar seen in the history of American action movies, but this is done in such a manner in this movie that you won't give it a thought.)Eventually the five criminals start wondering whether the line-up was coincidental, because they get an offer from a person called Keyser Söze - a myth in the criminal underworld - and the entire situation seems just too organized to be a coincidence. I won't give away more of the movie if you haven't seen it, so I'll just move along to my personal opinions.As you might have guessed from the headline, I rather enjoyed this movie. It's got everything a thriller needs; an incredibly good story, great actors who tell the story like it should be told and a killer ending. The actors are brilliant and I love everything from Kevin Spacey's weird walk to Benico Del Toro's attempt to talk German-English (that's actually what he's trying to do, according to himself. His character is named Fenster, which is the German word for window, and hence he decided to give his character a German accent)But if I have to find something not so good about this movie, it's the fact that there's a Baldwin in it. I'm sick and tired of finding a Baldwin in 9 out of 10 American productions from the 1990s. BUT, the Stephen of the kind is doing a great job as the rather hot-headed McManus, and when that's the only flaw I can think of in this movie, that says a great deal about how good it is.The ending deserves an entire paragraph of its own. It is probably the only ending I have seen that has managed to change my impression of the rest of the movie.

It influenced me to settle in San Francisco, as it is indisputably the ultimate San Francisco movie, with Bullitt a very respectable second. I have personally visited almost every real location depicted in the movie, and I love to give my out of town visitors the Vertigo tour of the places that still exist. Vertigo is a great tour of some of the many beautiful spots in and around SF.I love Alfred Hitchcock films and though Rear Window is my favorite, I think Vertigo is his best and perhaps most personal. From the opening titles and wonderful Bernard Hermann music soundtrack to the haunting conclusion, Vertigo is a visually lush and grandly entertaining example of masterful storytelling. I cannot articulate enough how great this film is and do it justice in 1000 words. The viewer is drawn in voyeuristically with the Jimmy Stewart character as he feels the tension of escalating obsession and the just-out-of-reach frustration with an unobtainable illusion. The use of music is one of the best ever in film as it reflects the inward emotion perfectly. You can hear what Jimmy Stewart is feeling. First there is curiosity, then rising tension, rising hope, and then release and resolution. Vertigo has one of my favorite film shots in it too (possibly the first time it was ever used), the zoom-in-while-backward- tracking shot, later seen in films like Jaws. Oh! And Vertigo has one of the greatest on-screen kisses of all time too, so very passionate (and I think shot on a turntable). The way Alfred Hitchcock was able to imply such sexuality in Vertigo without showing even nudity, I think, made the situations even more sexually charged, as what one imagines is far better. This is a film that earns a rare but well deserved 10\/10 in my book.

From the opening titles and wonderful Bernard Hermann music soundtrack to the haunting conclusion, Vertigo is a visually lush and grandly entertaining example of masterful storytelling. I cannot articulate enough how great this film is and do it justice in 1000 words. The viewer is drawn in voyeuristically with the Jimmy Stewart character as he feels the tension of escalating obsession and the just-out-of-reach frustration with an unobtainable illusion. The use of music is one of the best ever in film as it reflects the inward emotion perfectly. You can hear what Jimmy Stewart is feeling. First there is curiosity, then rising tension, rising hope, and then release and resolution. Vertigo has one of my favorite film shots in it too (possibly the first time it was ever used), the zoom-in-while-backward- tracking shot, later seen in films like Jaws. Oh! And Vertigo has one of the greatest on-screen kisses of all time too, so very passionate (and I think shot on a turntable). The way Alfred Hitchcock was able to imply such sexuality in Vertigo without showing even nudity, I think, made the situations even more sexually charged, as what one imagines is far better. This is a film that earns a rare but well deserved 10\/10 in my book.

Great characters, great story, great cinematography, great dialogue, great soundtrack, very believable and all the rest... a real pleasure to watch. I gave it a 10.I'm an American, but I have visited London and the East End several times, so the accents were a little difficult, but not enough to be a problem.******** Spoilers below! if you haven't seen this film yet *********Having already spouted glowing comments about this film, let me say that I have only one minor issue with it... several times I noted things that I thought were mistakes, but were not. Many have mentioned them here before, but I'll repeat a few. (note these are obviously not an issue imho)Q1 Right after Eddie loses the Three Card Brag game with Harry, Barry the Baptist grabs Eddie outside and tells him he expects the money in a week from Eddie and his friends. The problem is... it couldn't have been but a few minutes later, and Barry wasn't at the game, so how did he know so fast that Eddie had lost unless he was secretly watching them play?A1 Well, Eddie must have figured that since they all had cell phones Harry must have called Barry at some time since he lost the game. Probably when we didn't see Harry (he was off camera) for a few minutes immediately after Eddie lost (he zombied around a while with cool camera angles and music).Q2 How did Barry know Harry's hand was better than Eddie's (Barry said, We'll take you to the cleaners.)?A2 Barry couldn't see Harry's cards (the cheating mechanism only worked one way -- to tell Harry), but it's probably not too hard to believe that Eddie's hand was so bad for 3 Card Brag that Barry instinctively knew that Harry would do better.Q3 Why did Big Chris take the money from Dog? A3 As already mentioned here, Big Chris had never seen the guys and had just happened upon Dog as he was coming from the place that was the guys' address. This is also proved because he tells Hatchet Harry, One of the boys had'em. When Harry asked him about the shotguns.Q4 How did Big Chris know Dog's name when he was slamming the door on Dog's head? (Big Chris was screaming and yelling, Never, never, never, has anyone been as rude to me as you, Dog! F@!%king, bastard! A4 Big Chris could have learned Dog's name on the short trip over to Harry's. We just don't know for sure, but it's possible.Now here's my only issue with film, and it's rather minor and I'd be happy to read any dissenting views or different interpretations and opinions... everything the characters did were very believable and understandable because we'd do the same thing if we were in their shoes except for one...Q4 Why did they party at the pub after ripping off their neighbors?This has no answer because when I put myself in their shoes, especially Eddie's, I would not want a second to pass without first settling the debt with Harry. They had no idea if they would be robbed, or if Dog would find them, and so they (or Eddie) should have immediately marched over to Harry's and settled the debt. No partying. No delay. Now, if someone says that they had to wait until Harry, Barry, or Chris came looking for them, I don't think that holds water because Eddie called Harry shortly after the money went missing.Another few positive comments then, I'm off. <g> I really liked the Gary and Dean characters (the Liverpool scousers) a lot and wish there could be an entire film with just them on their escapades. Hence the summary title, We've got to get those guns.Also, SNATCH was good, but I didn't like it as much as LOCK. Also, for years I've felt that QT was waaaay overrated. I saw all of his films and the guy uses violence for shock purposes and little else. When I saw PULP I thought it was no big deal. Contrived and unbelievable. With LOCK, even Vinnie Jones in his DVD interview said, that what was being portrayed could really happen.Further, the intensity of the scene where Big Chris (presumably) kills Dog is so great that I think someone was asking for other examples of it.

When I was 13, I watched Annie Hall because I simply had to see the film that beat out my beloved Star Wars for Best Picture in 1977. It absolutely blew me away - it was funny, very funny, and also a little dark. The following year, Bullets Over Broadway came out and I was hooked.I've seen most of Allen's work and find most of it fantastic. Initially, though, I didn't like Crimes and Misdemeanors. This probably occurred because I saw it as a 10 year old, shortly afterit came out. It bored me. Why not? It was incredibly dark and really not like any comedies I'd ever seen. So, I never returned to it. This fall, I saw it in my local library and thought I'd take it out. My friends, J&J, had very different opinions on the film. One J called it awful, the other his favorite Allen film. I watched and agreed with the second J, for, I will always consider Crimes and Misdemeanors one of my two favorite Woody Allen films (depending on where the wind's blowing, I might respond with Manhattan when asked for my favorite of his films). Be warned, though, it's a dark masterpiece and misanthropic too. While Deconstructing Harry reveled in Allen's self-contempt, Crimes chronicles his disgust with humanity. It's one of the few films I know to end on such a down note, nary a glimmer of sun light to be found. Yet, in its own misanthropist, the film becomes funny. It's so dark, so rife with pessimism, that that single-mindedness is humorous. Was that the intention of Woody? Who knows or cares.The acting is also brilliant on all levels. Woody is great, as are Mia Farrow and Alan Alda (so slimy). Best of all, though, is Martin Landau who lends humanity to an otherwise horrible man. Though not as good as his representation of Lugosi in Ed Wood, Landau is brilliant here as well. I find this a fantastic film and recommend it to those who like dark humor and Deconstructing Harry (those who reviled that film may want to steer clear of this one as well). Woody-philes, though, should not avoid it simply because it's more serious than his other work; it should in fact re-affirm your faith in the man, allowing you to realize he has more talent than he sometimes lets on.

The acting is very well done for such a low budget film ($50,000- $380,000 mark) the direction is really exciting & the story has a good pace, as director Sam Raimi rarely let's a scene go by without something creepy & brutal happening. The gore effects are extremely disgusting & the film is in & of itself excessively violent, although most of the films violence is directed towards the super ugly, slimy bloody, & overly violent, taunting demons, so the violence isn't that tough to take. Those with strong stomachs should definitely check this out, while the squeamish & non to familiar with the horror genre kind of film fan should widely avoid it. Joseph LO DUCA'S score is very well orchestrated & fits the film like a glove. Despite the obviously low budget, the gore effects are very realistic & the kills & possessions, coupled with some really good stop motion animation effects are very inventive & interesting. In terms of plot or what little there is, the film owes a lot to EQUINOX. Raimi also pays tribute to THE EXORCIST, HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL & NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD while throwing in plenty of H.P. Lovecraftian touches. Another thing I feel really played very well for the filmmakers was it's almost non existent budget. THE EVIL DEAD has very little lighting, resulting in some rather dark sequences that I felt added to the creepiness & suspense of the film's atmosphere. Unlike it's next two sequels, the character of Ash is not a cocky, brave, one liner spewing hero, but rather a terrified youngster not knowing what to do in such a hideous situation, especially after his sister, girlfriend & two best friends join the demonic ranks. That said the film does have some issues that could have been elaborated on, for starters what did become of the professor & his wife who wound up possessed? I understand the questions were answered in EVIL DEAD 2, but here they could have made some mention on whether or not the old guy died or lived. Whatever became of his wife? Did he kill her & cremate her remains? bury her somewhere? was he found & locked away in a mental hospital? It's never mentioned in the script & if the demon that is raised up that is going around possessing the kids is so powerful, why doesn't it just storm the cabin & take the kids over one by one, instead of waiting for them to look out the window or go inside? One could say maybe there was a spell put on the cabin that prevented the creature from entering, but if so, how is it that the demons can possess the students enter into the cabin? & where is the super strong unseen evil entity doing all the possessing during the films climax when Ash is trying to rid himself of the creatures? why if the book is burned does it destroy the demons but not the big one doing the possessing? & why if the professor raised the demon accidentally by reading the passages is it asleep when the kids get there & needs resurrection again? especially if it's seen roaming the woods as the kids are headed up there? If it's so powerful why can't it stay out of it's slumber? None of this is ever explained & if one watches closely they can see a few editing mistakes, such as the scene where Cheryl is drawing a clock & the spirit forces her to draw it's face, you can see a shot of her struggling against her will before the demon even does anything to control her. When Cheryl levitates up in the air & starts to talk, you can see her mouth closed when she was supposed to be talking & why is Scott's girlfriend Shelly lying to Ash's girlfriend when she makes her guess what card's she's holding up is not known, as to why Ash never lets his friends know the bridge was torn out & the fact that he should have known something was terribly wrong right off the bat.

Seeing that he must force Hanson out of the race to get Hathaway in, Hanson launches a private investigation that reveals evidence that suggests that Hanson had multiple sexual partners in college including an orgy with a large group of men.

I had heard good things about this film and taped it when it was shown on channel 4 (albeit confusingly late at night). From the very start the film is sharp, interesting and paints US politics as being full of dirty tricks and horse trading but it cannot manage to pull this off and often falls into being a bit too preachy at times and ultimately ends up being a bit of an anticlimax. The film needed to be sharp and prickly with a wry twist at each turn and it does manage this for some times but it does sag at times and didn't draw me in with substance that I was convinced by (in reality it would not be this tame). The script also put me off by clearly being written as a defence of Clinton and, even as a liberal, I need more than that to make a film work. In the end the film betrays reality by having one of those 'honest and upright' sentimental moments that also take the sheen off The West Wing when they do it. The film holds this off for almost two-thirds of its running time but then it falls into a preachy, unrealistic and off-putting conclusion that made me almost totally forget any sharp edge or intelligence that I may have seen in it prior to this point.It is a shame that the writing wasn't there because I did think that Lurie did a pretty good job as director, setting up some good shots and generally giving the film a very professional feel throughout. He is helped of course by a cast that would usually be reserved for a major director who has a history of getting his cast Oscars &#150; not a relative newcomer from a UK movie magazine (but I guess he made the right connections in his time). Oldman may not be the main character but he does steal the show somewhat. His character is let down by the ending but mostly with sly manipulation is convincing and engaging. Try as they might neither Bridges nor Allen could make me believe that these people exist within politics &#150; they were a fantasy like in the West Wing, but at least WW makes its fantasy have a bit of human fallibility. Petersen is good in his early scenes but his payoff is signposted from a mile or two away and is tiresome in its predictability &#150; not his fault, he does the best he can. Slater, Rubinek, Elliott, Hemingway and a few others all add to the sense of a product deep in quality and they are all OK even with not a great deal to do.Overall this is an OK film that is worth watching for what it tries to do and partly does succeed in doing. However not even the big name cast can do much with a plot that gradually forgets its promise as a look at political manipulating and dirty games and quickly becomes an attack on the treatment of Clinton before ending with a fairytale conclusion that would make even the most naïve liberal feel a little sickly from a saccharine overdose.

WRONG!, I wish I'd stopped at II. The storyline was not good, it seemed to me like a story made up just to have a story, the characters were weak especially the daughter. Pacino's protege was a weak character that would have been eaten alive in Godfather 1 or 2. Then scenes such as, Corleone being invested with all the trappings of the Catholic Church with full choir, the assassin on horseback riding away into the sunset, the unseen helicopter machine gunning of the meeting (where the 'goodies' get away and everyone else is shot),daughter and 1st cousin rolling bits of pasta across a board, the pathetic shooting on the steps ..... Corleone stuffing sweets down him with orange juice for diabetes (a man of his intelligence and guile isn't ready for an emergency?)... NO it was not good and with the best will in the world I wont be able to watch it again. But I'll watch 1 & 2 many times down the years.

Pacino's protege was a weak character that would have been eaten alive in Godfather 1 or 2. Then scenes such as, Corleone being invested with all the trappings of the Catholic Church with full choir, the assassin on horseback riding away into the sunset, the unseen helicopter machine gunning of the meeting (where the 'goodies' get away and everyone else is shot),daughter and 1st cousin rolling bits of pasta across a board, the pathetic shooting on the steps ..... Corleone stuffing sweets down him with orange juice for diabetes (a man of his intelligence and guile isn't ready for an emergency?)... NO it was not good and with the best will in the world I wont be able to watch it again. But I'll watch 1 & 2 many times down the years.

With this movie, Akira Kurosawa has proved he is one of the greatest film directors in the history. Ilked so much this adaptation, its very simple, but also very well-treated; the actors were great and also the screenplay. First I must say that Kurosawa took a short story from Ryunosuke Akutagawa and extracted all its elements The Era, the clothes, the traditions, the houses and the bad face of the people, in order to make an excellent movie; all the atmosphere can take the watcher into the Edo time (a bit more ancient than Tokugawa, and introduce us into the realistic environment of that time the scenery and the photography is another thing that we can include, the sunshines and the forest were some of the best parts, and Kurosawa knew how to balance them. For the other part, Toshiro Mifune should be called The Japanese Marlon Brando; I mean, he made an excellent Tajomaru, a dirty, but serious thief; many times I thought he was really like that, perhaps one can't see if he is acting or not, and that's something that gives credibility to the movie; the part in which he was tied in the court, just like a dog, is so impressive; I wonder if that was part of medieval Japanese customs, or if both Akutagawa and Kurosawa made that for show a symbolism. ¡The Actress! She was also brilliant, I don't know her name, but he creates an excellent, pathetic, weak and coward character; the way he escaped form Tajomaru showed her fear, her cowardliness, and also the infidelity First she was with the husband, but then, passed to Tajomaru. ¡How Pathetic! The character is double-faced and I love it, and so the actress. Finally, the best part of the screenplay, is that Rashomon is not just a story, but a lot of stories, seeing by each character's eyes Each tells what they remember about the murder. And all of these are full of reflections about humanity, oneself, the others. Love, loyalty, madness, and great style of samurai fight between two man. In spite of all my comments, however, I must accept that I had problems identifying all these elements, but now since I enter deeply on the movie; all I have to say is that the film industry could not survive without Rashomon. But there are a lot of movies that we still have to see, such as The Last Tango in Paris, from Bernardo Bertolucci, and The Last Emperor as well, but have faith. Watch movies, and decide if they are one of the greatest or not the cinema and literature are very identical anyway. Technically are different, I know, but deep inside, they show art, story, love, passion, and tradition, from the countries or from the director's vision.Thank you Mr. Kurosawa, for sharing your talent with the world, and thank you Mr. Mifune, for let us know your unmoral name.

That's where they dress up however they like, strut their stuff in front of an audience and are voted on. We get to know many of the members and see how they all hold together and support each other. As one man says to another--You have three strikes against you--you're black, gay and a drag queen. These are people who (sadly) are not accepted in society--only at the balls. There they can be whoever and whatever they want and be accepted. Then the film cuts to three years later (1989) and you see how things have changed (tragically for some). Sounds depressing but it's not. Most of the people interviewed are actually very funny and get a lot of humor out of their situations. They're well aware of their position in society and accept it with humor--just as they should. We find out they all live in houses run by various mothers and all help each other out. The sense of community in this film is fascinating.When this film came out in 1990 it was controversial--and a big hit. It won Best Documentary Awards at numerous festivals--but was never even nominated for an Academy Award. Their reason was Black and hispanic drag queens are not Academy material. Fascinating isn't it? Homophobia and racism all together. Seen today it's still a great film--and a period piece. It just isn't like that anymore--the NY they show no longer exists. The balls are still held but not in the spirit we see here. Also drag has become more accepted in society (for better or worse). And I've heard the houses are gone too. That's kind of sad. I WOULD like to know where these characters are now--I know two died of AIDS but I have no idea about the others. And what DID happen to that 13 year old and 15 year old shown? Still, it a one of a kind documentary--fascinating, funny and riveting. A must see all the way! A definite 10. Where's the DVD???
