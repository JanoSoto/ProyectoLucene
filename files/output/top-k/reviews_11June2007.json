He's the deranged genius with a god complex, following along the lines of Dr.No and Goldfinger, yet with even more ambitious plans. His henchman, Jaws (Kiel), is a giant, unstoppable force out of every agent's worst nightmare no matter how many times you stop this monster, it will always be temporary. By the middle of the film, we can't wait to see the next confrontation between Bond and this ultimate killer. And, when I first saw this guy, he really seemed to be a terrifying opponent - so much so that I really wondered whether Bond would get thru this mission in one piece. This was finally a match for Connery's ultimate foe, Oddjob - Moore's own super enemy (try not to think of Moonraker when watching this, or, better yet, don't see Moonraker). Bond's KGB counterpart (Bach) here is female - she is Bond's equal in every sense, not the stumbling Bond girls we'd seen in previous Bonders (as in The Man With the Golden Gun). We finally see the women's liberation movement make itself apparent in the Bond universe and it made for some interesting storytelling, resulting in entertaining competition between the two agents and even a subplot about how Bond may be looking at some payback from his ally.All the other elements which we've become accustomed to in a Bond adventure are realized to near perfection in this one the exotic locales, beginning in the snowy mountains of Austria, then in Cairo, Egypt and Sardinia, are exquisitely shot, accentuating the action scenes in each.

Today it is difficult to imagine how anyone could have taken the thing seriously even in 1959; the thing is both lurid and lewd, but it is also incredibly ludicrous in a profoundly bumptious sort of way.The story, of course, concerns a doctor who is an eager experimenter in transplanting limbs--and when his girl friend is killed in a car crash he rushes her head to his secret lab. With the aid of a few telephone cords, a couple of clamps, and what looks very like a shallow baking pan, he brings her head back to life. But is she grateful? Not hardly. In fact, she seems mightily ticked off about the whole thing, particularly when it transpires that the doctor plans to attach her head to another body.As it happens, the doctor is picky about this new body he wants one built for speed, and he takes to cruising disconcerted women on city sidewalks, haunting strip joints, visiting body beautiful contests, and hunting down cheesecake models in search of endowments that will raise his eyebrow.

The film is 145 minutes long, that's almost two and a half hours. And not much happens during this time. The pacing is about on the level of The Straight Story (1999), which was only 112 minutes; so if that film had you climbing the walls you should probably steer clear of this one. On the other hand Paris, Texas is a technical masterpiece with great photography, excellent directing, and solid performances from the entire cast (although that cast is small). And it's a lyrically told story about loss, loneliness, and eccentricity; a look America and American values from an outside perspective (in this case European). I'm not sure that the film's message(s) is gotten across (unless you listen to the commentary feature on the DVD and maybe not even then) but it is certainly more coherent than when Michelangelo Antonioni tried to do the same thing in the early 1970's. The film opens with a wanderer walking alone in the desert. You eventually learn that this is not Howard Hughes but Travis Henderson (Harry Dean Stanton), that he has been missing the past four years, has semi-amnesia (a lot is made of this but the condition is never adequately explained), has a seven year-old son name Hunter (Hunter Carson), and a wife named Jane (Nastassia Kinski). Kinski fans will be somewhat disappointed as she does not even appear until the last third of the film (except briefly in some grainy home movies). The film could actually be classified as a buddy picture-road movie or two buddy picture- road movies. The first third features Travis and his brother's (Dean Stockwell) journey from Texas to LA, the final third Travis and his son's journey back to Texas. The weakest part is the middle third which serves little purpose other than providing some background details and linking the two journey segments. Because Paris, Texas is not your standard pre-sold commercial product, most of its suspense comes from the viewers themselves, who have little idea just where the film is headed. So if you watch a lot of films and are jaded because everything is so predictable, this movie viewing experience should be a nice change of pace. Because you haven't met these characters in other films, it takes a lot of storytelling to flesh them out, which is probably the biggest reason for the film's extended running length. Sam Shepard's script is not so much elliptical as it is evasive, somehow the characters tell us their most basic beliefs and deepest fears without really revealing anything about themselves (insert Two Lane Blacktop here). German New Wave director Wenders gets an astonishingly unaffected performance from young Hunter Carson, as convincing as any you are likely to find. Carson never did much after this amazing debut. The most intriguing sequences take place between Stanton and Kinski. The actors are never face-to-face as their characters speak to each other from opposite sides of one-way mirror. Travis has found Jane working in a seedy shop where lonely men pay to talk to women on the telephone.? The DP fills the screen with images of people dwarfed by vast, distant, and impersonal land\/ cityscapes. The most effective and original is a sequence of Travis walking along a bridge over a LA interstate with the audio supplied by an unseen (until the end) and rambling derelict addressing the bumper to bumper traffic rushing by below. Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.

THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE, loosely based on the novel by Paul Gallico, was very special indeed. So much so that it was not simply a movie. It was an event.The film's fame is such that the story is extremely well known. An aging passenger liner, the Poseidon, is making a final voyage at an unsafe speed and with insufficient ballast. Shortly after midnight on New Year's Eve it encounters a ninety foot tidal wave and capsizes, leaving a handful of survivors to fight their way to the only point in the hull from which rescue might come.The opening sections of the film, during which we meet various passengers, was filmed aboard the Queen Mary. Once we enter the Grand Salon for New Year's Eve festivities, however, every set has been constructed to full size. There are no CGI effects, no rear projections, and (with the exception of long shots of the ship itself) there are no miniatures. The cast works exclusively in the middle of tangible effects, and then as now, the result is remarkably disturbing. It looks real because it is real.And it is really that sense of reality that puts THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE at the forefront of its genre. Disaster films have been popular since the silent era, but THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE was virtually without precedent in 1972. It is difficult to convey the visual shock the film had in its first theatrical release. People screamed and jolted in their seats, and when the ship capsized the entire audience leaned to the right, clutching at their arm rests and each other. You left the theatre physically drained, your conversation laced with nervous laughter.It is true that the film's dialogue is more than a little corny, but this was indeed made at a time when children still said 'No, Sir' and 'Yes, Ma'am;' the film reflects its era, and many viewers were as shocked by the profanity as they were by the special effects. But whatever the film's shortcomings in terms of dialogue, there can no dispute about the plot this is one movie that really moves, and with such speed and logic that you can barely catch your breath.The cast reads very much like a Who's Who of acclaimed actors of the day. Leading man Gene Hackman was fresh from his Oscar-winning performance in THE FRENCH CONNECTION. Shelly Winters, Ernest Borgnine, and Red Buttons were all former Oscar winners. Carol Lynley received heavy-weight critical acclaim in earlier films and Stella Stevens was the popular star of many light comedies--and gave the performance of career when she stood her image on its head. Jack Albertson and Roddy McDowell were noted character actors, and even comparatively minor roles such as the ship's captain and chaplain went to such notables as Leslie Neilson and Arthur O'Connell. Together they make the unlikely nature of the story seem entirely plausible.The recently released Special Edition DVD cannot, sadly, compensate for the loss of the big screen--but that aside it is really quite fine. The print is virtually pristine, and while the sound is a bit lacking it is solid enough to make me wonder at those who complain. The bonus material is also very good, including considerable Making Of information, brief interviews with surviving members of the cast, thoughts about iconographic subtext, and story board samples. The commentary track by director Ronald Neame is both informative and entertaining, and while the commentary track by Carol Lynley, Stella Stevens, and Pamela Sue Martin is somewhat spotty it is enjoyable none the less.

It is painstakingly stitched together, reinforced and strengthened. Like a faulty apparatus, however it stretches and breaks under the sheer weight of what it is supposed to support.I can explain the entire plot of this movie. I viewed the movie recently after seeing it five or so times before, but the difference was that it had been four years since my last viewing. With the aid my previous experience, I was finally able to connect all of the dots and see the whole picture. Contrary to popular belief, every facet of the story is explained, but not clearly so. In the end, it is like somebody viewing a complex tapestry through a pair of fogged glasses.I noticed a curious coincidence when I watched the theatrical trailer. A point was made to show all of the violent moments of the film. The images include mid-air acrobatics, fights, chases in the street, gunshots, exploding cars, guns being loaded, a woman being slammed against furniture, people clinging to the outside of a bullet train and an exploding helicopter. The impression is that of an exciting action film; the movie itself is not. The trailer even makes Henry Czerny's character look like the villain when he is not.The Impossible Mission Force, or IMF, is the most elite branch of the CIA where failure results in the repudiation of all knowledge of the operation. Tom Cruise plays Ethan Hunt, a member of an IMF team led by Jim Phelps (Jon Voight, in the role originally played by Peter Graves). Phelps is absent for the first operation, an elaborate deception used to coerce a confession. Jim's wife (foreign film actor Emmanuelle Béart) is under anesthesia for the act, and the team is worried that she will die from being under too long. It seems logical that the IMF would not risk the life of an agent without an anesthesiologist present, but never mind.The team's mission, which they choose to accept, is to catch a traitor attempting to steal the NOC List, which matches undercover code names with the agents' birth names. All but Ethan are killed, and the director of the CIA (the aforementioned Henry Czerny), believes that Hunt is an agency mole since he is the only one to survive, although Claire is soon discovered to also be alive. After his escape, Hunt contacts the list's potential buyer (Vanessa Redgrave, highly respected international actress) and agrees to steal the real McCoy so he can discover the identity of the man who betrayed him and his team.The problem is that the plot does explain itself thoroughly, but does so in such a convoluted and roundabout fashion that it leaves heads spinning like tops. There is one section where the mole is lying and trying to shift the blame to another. During this time Hunt is saying and thinking competing versions, and the result is confusing so nobody is sure what to believe. If you want see films that have complicated plots but explain them with marked clarity, watch Star Trek VI or The Maltese Falcon. It is bad enough when the casual moviegoer is baffled, but when Roger Ebert says he cannot pass a test on the plot, the script has some serious problems.The other issue is the movie's inability to define itself. Despite the sales pitch of the preview, there is little action to speak of. It is really more of a suspense film, but by misrepresenting itself, it limits its potential. The two famous scenes involve the theft of a computer program from an impenetrable vault and the finale when a helicopter is attached to a bullet train and gets dragged into the Chunnel (an underwater train tunnel connecting England to France, for those who do not know). Only three bullets are fired, and none of them by Hunt.The acting is mostly pedestrian. Only Czerny and Voight, and to a lesser extent Ving Rhames and Jean Reno, stand out. Czerny is deliberate and Voight is especially effective with the delivery of two lines, if discovered, they'll be executed, and They stamped it didn't they? Those damn Gideons! Yet, for some reason, I enjoy it. It is probably the ingenuity of the vault theft and helicopter finale. Despite its significant flaws, it has a real sense of fun and some wit in the dialogue. It will disappoint fans of the original series and people expecting lots of action, but it is just good enough to rank a six out of ten.

The trailer even makes Henry Czerny's character look like the villain when he is not.The Impossible Mission Force, or IMF, is the most elite branch of the CIA where failure results in the repudiation of all knowledge of the operation. Tom Cruise plays Ethan Hunt, a member of an IMF team led by Jim Phelps (Jon Voight, in the role originally played by Peter Graves). Phelps is absent for the first operation, an elaborate deception used to coerce a confession. Jim's wife (foreign film actor Emmanuelle Béart) is under anesthesia for the act, and the team is worried that she will die from being under too long. It seems logical that the IMF would not risk the life of an agent without an anesthesiologist present, but never mind.The team's mission, which they choose to accept, is to catch a traitor attempting to steal the NOC List, which matches undercover code names with the agents' birth names. All but Ethan are killed, and the director of the CIA (the aforementioned Henry Czerny), believes that Hunt is an agency mole since he is the only one to survive, although Claire is soon discovered to also be alive. After his escape, Hunt contacts the list's potential buyer (Vanessa Redgrave, highly respected international actress) and agrees to steal the real McCoy so he can discover the identity of the man who betrayed him and his team.The problem is that the plot does explain itself thoroughly, but does so in such a convoluted and roundabout fashion that it leaves heads spinning like tops. There is one section where the mole is lying and trying to shift the blame to another. During this time Hunt is saying and thinking competing versions, and the result is confusing so nobody is sure what to believe. If you want see films that have complicated plots but explain them with marked clarity, watch Star Trek VI or The Maltese Falcon. It is bad enough when the casual moviegoer is baffled, but when Roger Ebert says he cannot pass a test on the plot, the script has some serious problems.The other issue is the movie's inability to define itself. Despite the sales pitch of the preview, there is little action to speak of. It is really more of a suspense film, but by misrepresenting itself, it limits its potential. The two famous scenes involve the theft of a computer program from an impenetrable vault and the finale when a helicopter is attached to a bullet train and gets dragged into the Chunnel (an underwater train tunnel connecting England to France, for those who do not know). Only three bullets are fired, and none of them by Hunt.The acting is mostly pedestrian. Only Czerny and Voight, and to a lesser extent Ving Rhames and Jean Reno, stand out. Czerny is deliberate and Voight is especially effective with the delivery of two lines, if discovered, they'll be executed, and They stamped it didn't they? Those damn Gideons! Yet, for some reason, I enjoy it. It is probably the ingenuity of the vault theft and helicopter finale. Despite its significant flaws, it has a real sense of fun and some wit in the dialogue.

It is painstakingly stitched together, reinforced and strengthened. Like a faulty apparatus, however it stretches and breaks under the sheer weight of what it is supposed to support.I can explain the entire plot of this movie. I viewed the movie recently after seeing it five or so times before, but the difference was that it had been four years since my last viewing. With the aid my previous experience, I was finally able to connect all of the dots and see the whole picture. Contrary to popular belief, every facet of the story is explained, but not clearly so. In the end, it is like somebody viewing a complex tapestry through a pair of fogged glasses.I noticed a curious coincidence when I watched the theatrical trailer. A point was made to show all of the violent moments of the film.

It is by my standards not that good; I have appeared in the play and know its text intimately from many readings. And what I can say about the project is that this cinematic version of a good stage play is unusually good in a great many aspects--a rare achievement by the producers, William N. Graf and producer-director Fred Zinnemann, especially in that period between 1964 and the much later corporate decision to spend large amounts of money for special effects in the hopes of recapturing former glories through production values. Robert Bolt adapted his own well-planned theatrical version for the screen and arguably improved on the dialog scenes in the process. The music composed and conducted by Georges Delerue is dramatic and memorable without, in my view, ever becoming cloying nor intrusive. Costumes, settings and the lighting all rate special mention; in cinematic history, the early Tudor era has never I suggest looked as beautiful as it did here, not before nor since. Ted Moore's cinematography, veteran John Box's production design and Terence Marsh's art direction all won praise, while, Joan Bridge and Elizabeth Haffenden in their costumes brought a lost era to blazing and colorful life for millions. The unusual intensity of the film may comes from the honorable soul of Sir Thomas More, whose religious beliefs were sublimated to his ethical-moral dilemma; within the story line; this is a story about a man who thought ideas matter, and asked only to be allowed to act honestly upon his own ideas. Because they were religious and being misapplied to an increasingly reality-based world, he was challenged in that right--giving the plot its unusual power of concentration on one man's importance, one man's deeds and refusals. The film is dominated by Paul Scofield career-making role as Sir Thomas More, author, lawyer and statesman. His somewhat flattish voice and superb abilities here served a pedantic man, by giving him the human dimension of Scofield's own mind and charisma as well as his line readings. Wendy Hiller has little to do as his long-suffering wife but does in with great skill in my estimation. Susannah York and Leo McKern have more to work with and never seem to miss a step. Robert Shaw tries hard in a difficult role as King Henry VIII and does not quite succeed. Orson Welles is well cast as the rotund schemer, Cardinal Wolsey, builder of Hampton Court; Nigel Davenport is very good as the blunt Dike of Norfolk, and John Hurt as the weakling Richard Rich played a thankless part beautifully. Other in the cast included Corin Redgrave, Cyril Luckham, Colin Blakeley, Jack Gwillim, Yootha Joyce and Vanessa Redgrave as Anne Boleyn. By my science, the great achievement of the film is Zinnemann's pacing; as in High Noon and elsewhere, he gives the production a brilliance that perhaps its material only suggested, an ability only the greatest directors possess--King Vidor and Alfred Hitchcock I suggest among them. This is a film to be seen more than once, and one well worth considering between viewings for the problems, the examples of conduct and the setting provided for the playing out of human responsibility and its all-too-postmodern opposites provided therein.

Perhaps even more disconcerting, however, is the discovery that the construction of the World Trade Towers actually prompted the two novels upon which THE TOWERING INFERNO was based THE TOWER by Richard Martin Stern and THE GLASS INFERNO by Thomas M. Scortia and Frank M. Robinson, both of which concerned out-of-control fires in skyscrapers.When the 1972 success of THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE gave producer Irwin Allen the title Master of Disaster, Allen set out to live up to it and moved to acquire the rights to THE TOWER. 20th Century Fox was outbid by Warner Brothers--but Allen saw a way to turn a big project into a bigger one and encouraged Fox to snap up the rights to the Scortia and Robinson novel. Allen then managed to negotiate a deal that found Fox and Warner combining forces on a single film THE TOWERING INFERNO. As written by Stirling Slilliphant, the story concerned the world's tallest building on its grand opening--when shoddy constructions causes a fire that traps hundreds of people above the eighty-first floor.In a general sort of way, INFERNO might have been called POSEIDON REDUX, for while the specifics were quite different the concept was essentially the same an all-star cast trapped by a disaster and forced to fight for their lives. And the cast is amazing; not only did Allen succeed in getting Steve McQueen and Paul Newman to co-star, he signed Faye Dunaway to play Newman's love interest and cast Fred Astaire against type as a con-man. Even more astonishingly, he lured reclusive and legendary film star Jennifer Jones out of retirement for the sympathetic role of Lisolette Mueller. Other notables include William Holden, Richard Chamberlin, Robert Wagner, Susan Blakely, Robert Wagner, Susan Flannery, Robert Vaughn, and a pre-scandal O.J. Simpson.But POSEIDON and INFERNO differ in two very significant ways. POSEIDON focuses on the struggles of ten people who acted as a single unit throughout the film; INFERNO casts a wider net with multiple story lines, and the result is considerably looser in terms of plot and action. With the exception of long shots of the ship, POSEIDON did not use miniatures--and indeed every set and effect was real time; the sets were real, the water was real, the fire was real, and the cast (which did most of the stunts) was very much in the middle of it. The fire and the heights involved in INFERNO, however, were too dangerous for such, and consequently INFERNO makes considerable use of miniatures, various process shots (matte paintings and rear projection), and stunt people. Some of this has not dated well at all.With its loose structure, the occasional dated effect, and a running time of almost three hours, THE TOWERING INFERNO is sometimes less tense than simply wearing--but only occasionally, and even with these defects it remains a visually fascinating display of pre-CGI state of the art in special effects. At its best, it is an extremely exciting film, and certainly 1974 audiences found it so; it would play in theatrical release for close to a full year, becoming one of the biggest box office hits of the decade.The current Special Edition DVD release is quite fine, including a host of extras that range from a nicely done AMC Backstory documentary to an interview with Irwin Allen himself; the various commentary tracks (one of the scene specific re effects and stunt work) are also well done, although I did think it a pity that none of the surviving cast could be lured into commentaries of their own. The picture quality is excellent and the sound quality quite good. People will probably always argue about which is better THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE or THE TOWERING INFERNO.

I would go so far as to say that the film's main problem is in it's aging as its content and the way in which the film is delivered are fine; in fact, they actually feel ahead of their time.The film's core subject is the Cold War &#150; this is obvious. The Cold War ran between the end of the second world war (1945) and ended in the early 1990s with the fall of the Soviet Union so between these dates I'm sure this film was at the top of every AFI and BFI list imaginable not to mention people's personal ones as well. I can imagine people watching this film during the Cold War and genuinely being entertained that something so serious can be looked at in such a carefree and laughable way and this is very clever &#150; something only Kubrick and probably no one else could actually pull off. The way in which the Russians are allowed into America's secret den, the way suspicion and humour are connected during the 'he's secretly taking pictures!' gag and throughout as well as the way in which former Nazi accomplices are represented.The film also uses the technique of revolving around three different stories which is very advanced and adds to the film. These is the base and its fate in which American planes are purposely ordered to attack the USSR; the 'allies' in an underground American bunker dealing with the situation (and getting into some hilarious phone calls with the Russians whilst they're at it); and the lone plane that breaks away from Allied control as it nears its Soviet target.The first setting and its main characters Group Captain Mandrake (Sellers) and the aptly named bringer of death General Jack Ripper (Hayden) are absolutely hilarious to watch. Mandrake is English and remains calm in a crisis; only maybe raising his voice when he needs to give a monologue stating how he's taking control &#150; this is counteracted by Ripper's disturbing persona and ideas about how he's going to make the world a better place by, technically, destroying it. He has his own brilliant monologue all about water and an interesting conspiracy surrounding it.The second setting's humour comes across in the figure of phone calls to a Soviet leader whom we never hear speak yet totally understand through the American's conversation route. When he's told planes are heading to nuke a part of his country Yes, I can understand you're upset(!) is the American's next line of dialogue. We also spend enough time with the bomber crew to have feelings towards them even if it is the worst 'story' of the three as all that happens in terms of dialogue are co-ordinates and the like which makes it feel like a shoddy documentary on an air force crew. There aren't many funny moments either although the ending does enforce some laughs and the bomber crew are involved.Like I said, the film hasn't aged well in terms of its content about the Cold War; Russia used to be the enemy &#150; now we have a new one. This may be my own unique interpretation but I feel events in Iraq have now come to dominate the 'war' content\/topic\/theme in most of our lives. As well as this, the jokes do not come as free flowing as I expected and the film does threaten to take itself a little too seriously at times &#150; probably down to the seriousness behind the bomber crew's storyline.Even though the brainwave of the Nazi in the chair and his ideas of creating a new, ideal group of people underground if nuclear war does happen; all the while resisting his Nazi roots and saluting with one arm is a stroke of genius, it's the ideas and script concepts that carry the film &#150; not the humour within. This is probably Kubrick's least 'epic' film and as a result is probably (from what I've seen) my least favourite but that said, it's still an impressive attempt and shouldn't discourage you from seeing it.

These is the base and its fate in which American planes are purposely ordered to attack the USSR; the 'allies' in an underground American bunker dealing with the situation (and getting into some hilarious phone calls with the Russians whilst they're at it); and the lone plane that breaks away from Allied control as it nears its Soviet target.The first setting and its main characters Group Captain Mandrake (Sellers) and the aptly named bringer of death General Jack Ripper (Hayden) are absolutely hilarious to watch. Mandrake is English and remains calm in a crisis; only maybe raising his voice when he needs to give a monologue stating how he's taking control &#150; this is counteracted by Ripper's disturbing persona and ideas about how he's going to make the world a better place by, technically, destroying it. He has his own brilliant monologue all about water and an interesting conspiracy surrounding it.The second setting's humour comes across in the figure of phone calls to a Soviet leader whom we never hear speak yet totally understand through the American's conversation route. When he's told planes are heading to nuke a part of his country Yes, I can understand you're upset(!) is the American's next line of dialogue. We also spend enough time with the bomber crew to have feelings towards them even if it is the worst 'story' of the three as all that happens in terms of dialogue are co-ordinates and the like which makes it feel like a shoddy documentary on an air force crew. There aren't many funny moments either although the ending does enforce some laughs and the bomber crew are involved.Like I said, the film hasn't aged well in terms of its content about the Cold War; Russia used to be the enemy &#150; now we have a new one. This may be my own unique interpretation but I feel events in Iraq have now come to dominate the 'war' content\/topic\/theme in most of our lives. As well as this, the jokes do not come as free flowing as I expected and the film does threaten to take itself a little too seriously at times &#150; probably down to the seriousness behind the bomber crew's storyline.Even though the brainwave of the Nazi in the chair and his ideas of creating a new, ideal group of people underground if nuclear war does happen; all the while resisting his Nazi roots and saluting with one arm is a stroke of genius, it's the ideas and script concepts that carry the film &#150; not the humour within. This is probably Kubrick's least 'epic' film and as a result is probably (from what I've seen) my least favourite but that said, it's still an impressive attempt and shouldn't discourage you from seeing it.

I would go so far as to say that the film's main problem is in it's aging as its content and the way in which the film is delivered are fine; in fact, they actually feel ahead of their time.The film's core subject is the Cold War &#150; this is obvious. The Cold War ran between the end of the second world war (1945) and ended in the early 1990s with the fall of the Soviet Union so between these dates I'm sure this film was at the top of every AFI and BFI list imaginable not to mention people's personal ones as well.

That is not really the case. It is true that critics generally considered the film a failure, but many of them admired certain elements of it; it is also true that box office fell below expectations, but it was not a box office disaster in the same sense as the 1980 HEAVEN'S GATE or the 1981 INCHON.It is also true, however, that audiences howled with laughter at the film when it debuted, and although leading lady Faye Dunaway received a number of critical accolades for her performance as Joan Crawford, she also received an equal number of devastating reviews--and it was these that caught the spotlight. It was a humiliating experience for an actress particularly noted for her perfectionism, and rumor has it that Dunaway feels the film ended her career as a major film star. Whatever the case, Dunaway quickly developed a strategic silence about the film that she has maintained for some two decades.Seen today, it is easy to identify the core problems of the film. The most obvious is the script, which is extremely inconsistent in quality and yet perversely consistent in a style that can only be described as soap opera hot-house to the nth degree. This is particularly true of the dialogue assigned to Dunaway. Infamous lines such as No More Wire Hangers Ever, Tina! Bring Me The Axe, and I'm Not Mad At You, I'm Mad At The Dirt have become a staple of every drag queen from Maine to California.But the ultimate disaster here is director Frank Perry. Joan Crawford was a larger-than-life personality; the role is written to reflect this; Dunaway plays the role as it was written. But it would seem Perry sought to heighten the effect the rest of the cast is extremely, extremely restrained. This must have seemed like a good idea in theory, but it proves a terrible mistake in actual fact. No matter what Dunaway does with it, she can NEVER seem less than wildly overwrought in comparison to the rest of the cast, and the effect is very peculiar indeed.The designs and the cinematography also clash in an incredibly bizarre way. There is absolutely no doubt that everything about the film is exactingly accurate that is indeed the look of the period, right down to the very last detail. But the photography is extremely flat, and you are constantly aware that the sets are indeed movie sets, the costumes are movie costumes, and so on. Yes, it is all beautifully rendered, but you can't buy into it as anything real.The Hollywood Royalty Edition DVD edition offers a good but by no means flawless print of the film and several bonuses. It is unfortunate that they are not particularly illuminating. While director John Water's commentary is enjoyable, he approaches the film only as a fan. Even so, Water does make several telling points many of the things that Crawford does which seem so odd (bathing the face in ice, for example) are actually commonplace cosmetic necessities for movie stars; many of the things the film treats as abuse were, although carried to wild extremes in the story, typical of child-rearing practices of the 1940s and 1950s.There are also three short documentaries featuring a number of cast members, most notably Diana Scarwid; these are actually entertaining for the fact that those who appear still seem to regard the film as a good movie. The only really significant interview is with Lypsinka, an artist who has driven Crawford impersonations to the level of wicked satire and high art, and who offers a number of interesting personal insights into the iconography involved.Like the film itself, the bonus package has two great failures. The first is that Faye Dunaway does not appear in interview or commentary; it would be very interesting to have her own take on the film, its failures, and its afterlife. Given her sentiment, it is an understandable non-involvement; less understandable, however, that there is not so much as a potted biography of the actress--or indeed of any member of the cast, for there are no written notes of any kind.The second great failure of the bonus package is that it contains no factual information on either Joan or Christina Crawford. There is no indication here that those who knew both women are sharply divided over the accuracy of the portraits both here and in the book by Christina Crawford from which the film is drawn. A number of people, including actresses Betty Hutton and June Allyson, supported Christina Crawford's accounts, but an equal number, including actress Myrna Loy and Christina's younger siblings, flatly stated that Christina's accusations were largely fictitious.When all is said and done, and in spite of performances and moments that are actually extremely good in isolation, MOMMIE DEAREST is a film that falls under the so bad it's good category of cult films. While I am taken aback by the bizarre nature of the movie, I personally find the amusement involved almost as dark as the movie's plot; it is not among my cult film favorites.

The visuals are not beautiful, they are not haunting - they are not even cinematic. The made-for-TV pedigree absolutely shows through, the whole thing is shot at a low standard. Point me towards one, single frame that is memorable or striking, one image that actually sticks in your head. (For example Cillian Murphy walking through the streets of an empty London in '28 Days Later' was striking imagery)3. The music is irritating. Most of the time we have a low keyboard drone, presumably meant to generate an atmosphere of foreboding or menace, but actually it's just annoying.4. There's no pace, especially during the first half of the film; I wondered whether it was actually running slowed-down, perhaps as some clever David Lynch trick. The dialogue is repetitive and shallow. Now I know this first part of the film was a dream - so what? It isn't an excuse for making a large part of the film feel like running through treacle.5. The blue key. The weird man who jumps out behind the diner. The whole bit in the 'Silencio' theatre. The man spewing his coffee back up. The man in the wheelchair who gives orders. The cowboy. What? What the hell is going on with any of those things? Perhaps there's some hidden, cryptic meaning to be gleaned from them, but honestly I don't care. I don't watch a film so I can spend ages afterwards trying to make sense of it - there IS a difference between 'thought provoking' and 'needlessly confusing'.This film is not entertainment, it is art - with all of the negative, art-for-art's-sake, It doesn't have to mean anything connotations that go along with it. A movie doesn't need car chases and gunfights to be entertaining, it doesn't need a straightforward simple narrative to be good - but if it's going to spend most of it's running time being either tedious or weird, it had damn well better have a good reason for it, a decent pay-off at the end, and this film really, really doesn't.'Mulholland Drive' certainly did provoke a reaction in me - a negative one. It certainly does stick in my head, because of all the unresolved questions (see point 5). But to say that any film that provokes a reaction is a good film is naïve, and just because I'm still thinking about it does not mean it was good. After all, a swift kick to the nuts provokes a reaction, and an unfinished argument leaves you stewing - I'd rather avoid both.

Hence he is the conformist of the title of this extraordinary movie adapted by Italian film legend Bernardo Bertolucci from Alberto Moravia's novel. But more significant than his political conformity is his ability to bend his sexual nature to what is acceptable. The defining event of his childhood is his incomplete seduction by a gay chauffeur. When conformity to the fascist rule in Italy under dictator Benito Mussolini becomes the norm, Marcello marries the ordinary (but very pretty) Giulia (Stefania Sandrelli) whom he describes as all bed and kitchen. Marcello thereby sentences himself to a boring but secure petite bourgeois existence. He will simply suppress his abnormal instincts.In a sense this is a character study using a familiar theme, that of sexual repression leading to repressive political expression, such as psychoanalytic theory assigned to the fascist mentality. But Marcello is less interested in sadistic expression as he is with as a secure existence. He is something of a shrewd coward, cold, calculating, and indifferent to the feelings of others. We see this strikingly in the scene in the woods when Anna Quadri (Dominique Sanda), who is being chased by fascist thugs, pounds desperately on his car window. But he is completely unmoved and just stares at her with consummate indifference.But what really enhances this film is the beautiful cinematography by Vittorio Storaro and the extraordinarily designed sets and scenes envisioned by Bertolucci. I am reminded of Michelangelo Antonioni's gorgeous Blow Up (1966) and Swedish director Bo Widerberg's stunningly beautiful Elvira Madigan (1967) from the same era. I think Bertolucci wanted to make a film that was politically and psychologically significant but also one that was strikingly beautiful. He used not only sumptuous settings but hired two beautiful actresses in Sanda and Sandrelli. And because this movie is about sex (as it almost certainly must be, having been adapted from a novel by Moravia who was a master at expressing human sexuality) Bertolucci made the movie sexy and sensual. Sanda, whom I previously saw in Vittoria De Sica's The Garden of the Finzi-Continis which came out a year after El Comformista (1970) where she played the beautiful, enigmatic, but icy Micol Finzi-Contini, here plays Anna the bi-sexual wife of one of Marcello's college professors--the man whom Marcello has been instructed to help kill. Sanda is exquisitely sensual as she works to seduce Giulia while at the same time both teasing and rejecting Marcello's advances.Sandrelli is not be outdone. She too is beautiful and sensual even if the character she plays is a bit ordinary. The scene on the train where she describes to Marcello how she was ravished as a teen by an older man (the family lawyer) is very moving sexually, and very revealing because Marcello takes her description as a guide in how to make love to his wife! We can see clearly that he needs some instruction since he apparently is not really moved by her beauty.While the film itself stands alone as an artistic achievement, I want to compare it to the novel from which it was adapted. The main difference is that in the novel we learn so much more about the character of Marcello because of Alberto Moravia's use of an interior monologue throughout. Rather than merely a conformist, in the novel we see that Marcello's character is that of someone who seeks the trappings of conformity and normality because he rightly fears he is not the entirely normal person he would like to be. Ironically it is Giulia who nearly always conforms to what is considered normal behavior and who harbors uncritically the knee jerk beliefs and opinions that she has learned from church and state. Marcello is attracted to her not so much because she is pretty but because she is authentically ordinary and therefore by association he too is not abnormal. It is abnormality that Marcello fears.The ending in the novel is also different than in the movie although the sense of who Marcello is does not change. In the novel Quadri is a hunchback and his wife is clearly a lesbian who has married him for convenience and security, whereas in this film she is bisexual and he is more like someone she might marry for love. Another difference is in how what happens to the Quadris and the extent to which Marcello is responsible. Bertolucci chose to have Marcello at the scene, whereas in the novel he has no direct experience of their fate. Of course the novel, which is over a hundred thousand words long, goes more deeply into the character of Marcello than is possible in a film. The true psychological complexity of his character comes through, especially his struggle with sexual ambiguity. We see more clearly why he embraced fascism.But the film is true to the novel in most respects and certainly in the main sense that Moravia intended, that of showing how a particular type of fascist mentality arises and is maintained. But Marcello, although an authentic fascist is not necessary a typical one. The idea that fascists in general follow the herd and adopt a superficial and uncultured world view is no doubt largely correct, but the essence of fascism is the belief in authoritarian rule, the stratification of society, intolerance of diversity, and a willingness, even an eagerness to use force and violence to obtain such ends. The psychology underlying the portrait by Moravia and Bertolucci is the idea that Marcello sees in himself violent and selfish tendencies and so it is only natural that he should adopt a political philosophy that condones and acts out such tendencies.(Note Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!

One commenter stated that It looked like they were just making it up as they went along, to which I second that, although none of the dialog was even that imaginative. I just loved how the so-called bully (Juice) would harass Dodger, portrayed so ineptly by Mackenzie Astin by calling him a creep and then throwing him down in the sewer, dumpster, etc. All the human roles were cookie-cutter stereotypes and had absolutely no depth or personality whatsoever. I realize that this movie was made for kids, but even in other kid-friendly movies I've been forced to watch, you generally have some feeling or care about what's going on, even if it's only surface feelings. Watching this movie was the equivalent of having you eyelids propped open with toothpicks and duct tape and having to sit through an ABC After School Special about teen mothers played frame-by-frame in slow-motion and starring Scott Baio.Two things I still can't get over were two locations used in the storyline TOUGHEST BAR IN THE WORLD and the STATE HOME FOR THE UGLY. I suppose the writers felt that their audiences were certified mentally challenged and that it's imperative that everything must be spelled out for them.Movies can be silly, satirical, humorous, weird and even stupid sometimes, but this movie lacks all but the last I one I mentioned on this list. Nostalgia has never been so appalling as Garbage Pail Kids The Movie.

It was inspirational. Alexandre Dumas' classic story of brave musketeers is an outstanding story of courage, friendship and love.Although the plot might seem to be completely flat it is yet very enjoyable. Stephen Herek's adventure movie has a solid cast Kiefer Sutherland as Athos (who is now known as the agent Jack Bauer in TV-series 24), Charlie Sheen as Aramis, Oliver Platt as Porthos, Chris O'Donnell as D'Artagnan, delightfully slithery Tim Curry as Cardinal Richelieu, brilliantly nasty Michael Wincott as captain Rochefort and many more. All Dumas' great characters has found fitting actors for portrayal.Three Musketeers has been filmed several times and it has been fitted to an animation features but no other adaptation has made my heart so keen to the subject like Herek's 1993 version. Now fourteen years later after watching musketeers hundreds of times it still remains one of my favorite stories, and I cannot valuate its givens by rating the film. Even in nowadays I remember every line by heart. Three Musketeers is timeless piece of fiction and foundation of a great childhood. I recommend it to everyone in a family from seven years up. Three Musketeers represents what was then great adventure movie like Pirates of the Caribbean is now.The theme song All For Love performed by Bryan Adams, Sting and Rod Stewart remains one of the most influential songs in my records. Bryan Adams had had a collaboration earlier with now late composer Michael Kamen in Robin Hood The Prince of Thieves with records braking song (Everything I Do) I Do It For You) and Adams was asked to do a song for also Three Musketeers. It may not have been as big hit as Everything I Do... but it sure is as beautiful.Raise your swords and step in to the boots of the brave bodyguard's of the king of France!

Where do we begin? Let's get this straight from the beginning. I am a huge Star Wars fan. I have been one since the first one came out in 1977. I remember it well. I was 8 months pregnant. My husband was looking for a new job. It was his birthday. We could just about afford the matinée price for the two of us and for an a little less than two hours,we were entertained and trouble-free. It was a marvelous full-bodied movie. The second and third movies in the then trilogy proved to be just as entertaining. Who can forget Jabba the Hutt? Or the famous bar scene? So many imitators have paid homage in the past 30 years. Some fondly,some badly. THIS movie would have to fall in the very badly category. Note to whomever mucked up this( these) sequels Special effects can no longer carry a movie . You still need a decent script,interesting characters,lines that make sense,and (now here's the big one) ACTORS WHO WEREN'T PICKED FOR LOOKS ALONE! I refer of course to Anikin and Padme. No spoiler from me as to what happens. I couldn't care less. Teenage angst and hormones - give me a break. Buffy the Vampire Slayer delivered it better each and every week in 45 minutes between Spike and Buffy and and Buffy and Angel. This is mindless crap.

I don't know how precisely he managed to do this, but his delivery in this film makes Groundhog Day seem like a bigger, more important holiday than Christmas. This is a vehicle of the worst sort a movie meant to sell with star power, where the star basically plays himself, but the movie doesn't care enough about what it's doing to give the star any room to shine, and as a result the star just gets repetitive and obnoxious in his role. Probably the best example of this is the Oh, I get it now! monologue at the end, which never really says anything and keeps going on and on as Murray stumbles around throwing out ideas that are less revealing than the ones given to him in the spectral visits.By the time this movie ends, one can't help but anticipate the credits to see who's responsible for this stupidity.
