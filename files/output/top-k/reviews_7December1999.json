It was either late in 98 or early in 99 that the first trailer graced our screens for this flick.  The producers obviously knew that with combination of Arnold and the Y2K and all the Armageddon stuff, the earleir they could get this out into the public awareness, the better off they would be.  End Of Days looked fantastic and I could not wait to see it.  But that is where my enthusiasm ends and all cynicism begins.  End of Days is one movie that is so short of logic that after the first 20 minutes or so you are laughing and greatly anticipating the next idiotic plot piece to invade your intelligence.  End of Days is pure idiocy and it is not even fun to mask the ineptitude of the script, straight up, this is a terrible movie.Now I am going to attempt to explain very briefly what this movie wants us to believe.  It starts in 1979 where a priest in the Vatican looks outside and sees a comet racing over the moon.  He goes to an old drawing and it too has the comet over the moon.   The Eye of God.  he says to himself and then rushes into a chamber where the Pope is sitting with his religious advisers presumably talking about what they are going to do on New Year's Eve, and tells him that the child will be born tonight.  The Pope tells him he must find the child and protect her.  It seems that once every thousand years that a child will be born and that child will be the one that Satan has chosen to mate with so that he can come to Earth and wreak havoc and that will spell the End of Days ( get it? )  So now we cut to a dark hospital where a woman is giving birth and when the child is born, a nurse brings it down to the basement where some spooky looking people are waiting and one of them kills a rattle snake and puts the blood of the snake in the mouth of the child.  This is obviously the chosen one and by putting snake blood in her mouth that must mean that she is now protected by Satan and she is now Damien from The Omen.  So now we skip 20 years and we meet a buffed up Martin Riggs who is played by Arnold and he is going to kill himself because he obviously misses his wife and kid.  Hockney from The Usual Suspects walks into the room and tells him that they have a long day ahead of them and so killing himself is not very prudent right now ( I think Fenster and MacManus and Verbal and Keaton were sick on this day so they didn't come and join Hockney on this one ).  So we now know that a burned out Arnold is going to be called upon to save the girl.  That's all you need to know because the rest is really just a bad Arnold movie with logic that is so stupid that it defies logic to understand how this script got made. Here are some questions that I have for the writers of the film, and if you have seen this, you'll know exactly what I mean, if you haven't, hopefully it will deter you from doing so.1) If that guy at the beginning wasn't looking out his window and he didn't see the Eye Of God, would no one else have notified the Pope about this miraculous sight?  Was no one else aware of this Eye of God thing?2) If all of Satan's people knew that this girl was going to be born on this day, were there people all over the world in hospitals waiting for the girl to be born?  And that has to be the case because no one knew exactly where the baby was going to be born, so if that is the case then that means that every city in every country in the WORLD, there would have to be one nurse and at least one snake killing guy that would have to be waiting in the basement of every hospital in the world waiting on the off chance that it was their hospital that little Christine would be born in.  That is a pretty big following, say at least, what, 5 million kids are born every day, so that means at least 10 million people in this cult that are very well funded and have a proepnsity for catching snakes.  And you know snakes would not be too happy to lose their lives that day.  And what exactly does the blood do anyway? 3) If this day was so important and this child was so important, don't you think God himself would have taken a greater interest in trying to stop Lucifer from entering Earth therefore negating all that once was?  Somehow I think that he would send something more trustworthy that a drunk ex-cop with large biceps. 4) I have a great many problems with Thomas Aquinas.  First of all his name. No one ever mentions that his name is that of a great man from the past. If a guy named Albert Einstein showed up and was poking around doing things, I think someone may make a joke about it, or Sigmeund Freud, why not Thomas Aquinas.  And next, if this guy was all that the Vatican had going for them , don't you think that he would be a little more funded than he was and that perhaps he would live in a little nicer place than some rat infested-run-down-basement apartment in New York?  This guy was trying to save the world and he has no money?  I don't buy it.  And when Arnold and Lieutenant Wineberg find his place and they are searching for clues, how come there is a cat in the fridge that just happens to jump out at them? Why?  I have seen horror movies before that throw cats into the frame just to scare us, but never have I seen a cat that jumps out of a fridge.  Why would he be there?  How did it get there?  Are cats strong enough to open a fridge tp get in?  Did Thomas put him there to scare Jerico?  Would it not be dead if it was in the fridge?  All very good questions with no real answers. 5) If your best friend was kind enough not to kill you and then you saw him set on fire, do you A) let him burn B) try to put him out C) at least shoot him so that he doesn't feel the pain of burning to death.  I would say the answer to that is maybe B but more probably C since he is a raging inferno. 6) If a down and out ex-cop is offered all that God took away from him, why would he turn it down?  Does he all of a sudden have faith now?  Has God been good to him?  Does Satan not tempt him to have a better life?  Where is the side to him that wants to say no?  I don't buy that either?  I don't think Arnold's character would have said no to Satan. 7) How do you kill Satan?  You can't.  Not with what we have here.  If he is impervious to pain and bullets and can walk through fire, then why is it that a whole bunch of bullets can stop him? 8) If Satan can invade people's bodies then why didn't he invade Arnolds way back at the beginning and find out where the girl is?9) He is Satan, why can't he find her whenever he wants to? 10) What exactly is it that Rod Steiger and all of his people were doing in the basement with all of their computers?  Were they trying to track down where Satan was on the computer, or were they reading reviews on the IMDb or even checking their email.  According to Steiger, there are forces at work here that you can't possibly imagine.  OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO scary stuff!!I really could go on and on and on but I'll leave that to Celine Dion. Just saffice it to say that this is one film that has no logic to it and no matter if it is Arnold or not, it is a terrible film.  I liked it when he was Dutch and the Terminator and Matrix and Harry Tasker and all those other cool characters that he played.  But this Jericho is awful and End of Days is even worse.  If you want to have some fun picking apart a film, go see this one.  The ten issues that I touched on were just the tip of the iceberg, I'll bet that someone else could pick out ten other silly points to the movie that I didn't even mention, it is that stupid.End of Days stinks.  There is no other way to say it.  And I am still really confusedWhy was there a cat in the fridge?

It's not the action-packed thrill-fest that movies like Kill Bill or The Punisher seek to be, instead it's a haunting, sometimes intoxicating look at our society's views on justice.Charles Bronson is Paul Kersey, a New York architect whose wife is killed by a group of muggers ransacking their apartment, an attack that also leaves his daughter catatonic. The killers are never caught, and Kersey is left shattered.He takes a job working for a land developer in New Mexico to get his mind off his troubles, and while there his long dormant fascination with guns is renewed when his client Ames Jainchill (Stuart Margolin) shows off his personal collection and lets him crack some shots off. He also witnesses a live reenactment of an Old West shootout, where frontier justice was administered at the end of the gun.Kersey soon arrives back in New York, livened up a bit from his visit and ready to resume his life. But the streets are still filled with thugs, and Kersey knows that Manhattan is not the best place to be at night. He discovers that Jainchill has given him a .32 revolver as a present, and subsequently uses it to kill a man trying to mug him. Kersey soon realizes the cathartic release of enacting vigilante revenge as the media reports his killings and other private citizens take action, all while police officer Frank Ochoa (Vincent Gardenia) leads a task force to capture the vigilante and stop future violence.Death Wish was a product of its day -- a Nixon-era knee jerk reaction to rampant crime that turned out to be quite a hit. But to dismiss it simply as that would be to deny the film its true power. It asks the question of whether or not vigilantism can be used as a social good, and just how can a citizen properly defend himself from criminal attacks. More importantly, to the movie's credit it does introduce the downside of vigilantism, with Ochoa worrying that people will be whipped into such a frenzy that they'll start attacking anyone who looks suspicious.The movie does play it safe when it comes to Kersey's victims however. Every one of them is clearly a mugger, threatening his life or just wanting his money. But the movie does enter into ambiguous territory by looking at the actual actions Kersey takes. At first he just stumbles into traps set up by muggers or happens on a crime taking place; later on the other hand it's clear that he's actually inviting attacks by making himself a target. And the self-defense aspect of his actions becomes equally cloudy when he kills muggers that are already fleeing. He wants to punish them for their crimes, which itself can be morally troubling.But to understand Death Wish you had to understand the times. Murder rates were very high in New York City, and many muggers had little problem killing their victims. The criminals in the film are not overly sympathetic either, most of them clearly hippies or other social undesirables, probably hooked on drugs from their free love days and now stuck in the bitter reality of narcotic dependency now that the good times are over. It's hard to feel sorry for someone willing to kill you just for a couple hours worth of pleasure. I'm sure the movie's audiences in New York, and probably across the country, enjoyed living out their revenge fantasies vicariously through Kersey.It should be said that Bronson, normally criticized as a wooden actor, gives a remarkably strong performance. This may be due to his friendship with director Michael Winner, who also helmed several of his other films. But it's probably due to the fact that the movie was not written as an action hero vehicle, and because of this the story demanded a character more grounded in reality. Kersey is not a superhero -- he's just one man trying to make a difference in the world.Also, he's not all there, either. The movie makes it clear that Kersey is a little deranged as well, and one wonders just how far he might go to do what he thinks is right. The sequels were more interested in making him out to be an infallible crusader against evil, abandoning any pretext of social commentary and just offering body counts, but here at least the movie shows that someone willing to go on a shooting spree isn't quite right in the head, regardless of the guilt of his victims.Supporting roles are excellent as well. A very young Jeff Goldblum nails his performance as one of the muggers who invades Kersey's apartment, immediately scary and repellent. Gardenia is a nice foil for Bronson, making Ochoa an intelligent officer not unsympathetic to Kersey's crusade, especially when he sees how the crime rate plummets following the killings. Christopher Guest, who would go on to star in hit mockumentaries like This is Spinal Tap, Best in Show and A Mighty Wind has a small but memorable role as a police officer towards the end of the movie. In fact, everyone does a good job.Ultimately, your enjoyment of Death Wish will probably rely both on your politics and views toward crime. It's a movie where the critic is judged based on his review, which is just as well I suppose. It's at once fascinating, and still very timely.Nine out of ten stars. Bronson's best solo movie and certainly a very thought-provoking piece, which is lost on both people who only want to watch it for the mugger killings and those who just dismiss it a fascist trash.

Murder rates were very high in New York City, and many muggers had little problem killing their victims. The criminals in the film are not overly sympathetic either, most of them clearly hippies or other social undesirables, probably hooked on drugs from their free love days and now stuck in the bitter reality of narcotic dependency now that the good times are over. It's hard to feel sorry for someone willing to kill you just for a couple hours worth of pleasure. I'm sure the movie's audiences in New York, and probably across the country, enjoyed living out their revenge fantasies vicariously through Kersey.It should be said that Bronson, normally criticized as a wooden actor, gives a remarkably strong performance. This may be due to his friendship with director Michael Winner, who also helmed several of his other films. But it's probably due to the fact that the movie was not written as an action hero vehicle, and because of this the story demanded a character more grounded in reality. Kersey is not a superhero -- he's just one man trying to make a difference in the world.Also, he's not all there, either. The movie makes it clear that Kersey is a little deranged as well, and one wonders just how far he might go to do what he thinks is right. The sequels were more interested in making him out to be an infallible crusader against evil, abandoning any pretext of social commentary and just offering body counts, but here at least the movie shows that someone willing to go on a shooting spree isn't quite right in the head, regardless of the guilt of his victims.Supporting roles are excellent as well. A very young Jeff Goldblum nails his performance as one of the muggers who invades Kersey's apartment, immediately scary and repellent. Gardenia is a nice foil for Bronson, making Ochoa an intelligent officer not unsympathetic to Kersey's crusade, especially when he sees how the crime rate plummets following the killings. Christopher Guest, who would go on to star in hit mockumentaries like This is Spinal Tap, Best in Show and A Mighty Wind has a small but memorable role as a police officer towards the end of the movie. In fact, everyone does a good job.Ultimately, your enjoyment of Death Wish will probably rely both on your politics and views toward crime. It's a movie where the critic is judged based on his review, which is just as well I suppose. It's at once fascinating, and still very timely.Nine out of ten stars. Bronson's best solo movie and certainly a very thought-provoking piece, which is lost on both people who only want to watch it for the mugger killings and those who just dismiss it a fascist trash.

It's not the action-packed thrill-fest that movies like Kill Bill or The Punisher seek to be, instead it's a haunting, sometimes intoxicating look at our society's views on justice.Charles Bronson is Paul Kersey, a New York architect whose wife is killed by a group of muggers ransacking their apartment, an attack that also leaves his daughter catatonic. The killers are never caught, and Kersey is left shattered.He takes a job working for a land developer in New Mexico to get his mind off his troubles, and while there his long dormant fascination with guns is renewed when his client Ames Jainchill (Stuart Margolin) shows off his personal collection and lets him crack some shots off. He also witnesses a live reenactment of an Old West shootout, where frontier justice was administered at the end of the gun.Kersey soon arrives back in New York, livened up a bit from his visit and ready to resume his life. But the streets are still filled with thugs, and Kersey knows that Manhattan is not the best place to be at night. He discovers that Jainchill has given him a .32 revolver as a present, and subsequently uses it to kill a man trying to mug him. Kersey soon realizes the cathartic release of enacting vigilante revenge as the media reports his killings and other private citizens take action, all while police officer Frank Ochoa (Vincent Gardenia) leads a task force to capture the vigilante and stop future violence.Death Wish was a product of its day -- a Nixon-era knee jerk reaction to rampant crime that turned out to be quite a hit. But to dismiss it simply as that would be to deny the film its true power. It asks the question of whether or not vigilantism can be used as a social good, and just how can a citizen properly defend himself from criminal attacks. More importantly, to the movie's credit it does introduce the downside of vigilantism, with Ochoa worrying that people will be whipped into such a frenzy that they'll start attacking anyone who looks suspicious.The movie does play it safe when it comes to Kersey's victims however. Every one of them is clearly a mugger, threatening his life or just wanting his money. But the movie does enter into ambiguous territory by looking at the actual actions Kersey takes. At first he just stumbles into traps set up by muggers or happens on a crime taking place; later on the other hand it's clear that he's actually inviting attacks by making himself a target. And the self-defense aspect of his actions becomes equally cloudy when he kills muggers that are already fleeing. He wants to punish them for their crimes, which itself can be morally troubling.But to understand Death Wish you had to understand the times.

Rent AFTER HOURS, one of my favorites and one of his greatests, and you'll see just what I mean. When the exciting trailers of this film popped up in movie theaters, I was expecting a twisted black comedy that only Marty's visuals could deliver. When I went to see this, that's ALMOST what I got.The problem with this movie, which is set on a few nights in early 90s NYC, is that it wants to be serious along with that evil, foaming grin underneath. Nic Cage plays paramedic so deadpan, you'd wish someone would pump him full of adrenaline!

The squealing harmonica goes perfect with Cage's despair, as he just wants to get a vacation and some sleep, instead of having another life in his hands that will only die in his care.When the film opens, he is joined by John Goodman (who is always good, but plays it light here) as they head to save a heart-attack victim from the directions of dispatcher Martin Scorsese himself. When I first saw them head for the rescue, I wondered why they were moving so sluggish and calmly up the stairs. Then I got the idea.

So many movies these days have well-written characters but not the thriving screenplay to back them up. At last, we can enjoy a film with strong comic performances, smart dialogue, and an engaging atmospheric environment.\tThe film stars John Cusack as a hot shot air traffic controller named Nick Falzone, nicknamed the zone because he is truly the best at his profession. He lives in New Jersey with his happy housewife, Connie, and their son. (who is seldom mentioned or seen.) He has an intense, stressful work life, enjoys having fun with his co-workers, and seems to have a pretty optimistic look at life.   \tAll things change, however, when Nick meets his new neighbor, Russell Bell. He's a roughneck motor cycle-driving, quiet and challenging man who really needs to shave. Nick immediately feels tension between Russell and himself. And it just so happens that Russell is also an air traffic controller, making things even more competitive between these two individuals. The two soon begin efforts to try to impress the other, in and outside the job. \tThe personal battles between Nick and Russell soon put each of them in bed with the opposite's wife. Nick is the first to commit adultery when he falls for Bell's highly attractive young wife, Mary. While he meant well, by taking her out for dinner after observing Mary sobbing at the grocery store, when they got home, things obviously got out of hand.  \tThe movie is very detailed both in the workplace and in its colorful, intriguing characters. The original tasting flavor of being placed in an air traffic control tower is quite captivating. The characters stare at the plane monitors like children at a television screen while playing a video game. The characters themselves are relevant, ordinary people, which is why they are so easy to relate to. Even though some of their personalities and motives are instantly obvious, we still have lots of fun watching their everyday living style\tWhile some comedies would eventually regulate into a formalistic climax and follow predictable events, Pushing Tin is too smart for that. The ending is happy and light hearted, but it's most of the fun getting there. Mike Newell, director of Four Weddings and a Funeral, knows exactly what he wants out of the actors here, and they do exceedingly well at giving what he requires. Each fits their character perfectly, especially Cusack, Jolie, and contributing an Oscar worthy performance, Thornton.\tPushing Tin offers a variety of  characters and contrasts them effortlessly. In particular, during a just-for-fun basketball game, Nick makes a sudden bet for $100 that Russell can not make a hoop from a certain point in the court. Russell excepts. Nick nervously changes his gamble to fifty cents, but Russell stands firmly on the original amount. He shoots...and misses. Close enough, Russell, pardons Nick, Lets call it even. Russell walks over to him manly and states You either make it or you don't, as he hands Nick the cash promised. The chemistry between these characters is as effective as pouring oil in to water.

So many movies these days have well-written characters but not the thriving screenplay to back them up. At last, we can enjoy a film with strong comic performances, smart dialogue, and an engaging atmospheric environment.\tThe film stars John Cusack as a hot shot air traffic controller named Nick Falzone, nicknamed the zone because he is truly the best at his profession. He lives in New Jersey with his happy housewife, Connie, and their son. (who is seldom mentioned or seen.) He has an intense, stressful work life, enjoys having fun with his co-workers, and seems to have a pretty optimistic look at life.   \tAll things change, however, when Nick meets his new neighbor, Russell Bell. He's a roughneck motor cycle-driving, quiet and challenging man who really needs to shave. Nick immediately feels tension between Russell and himself. And it just so happens that Russell is also an air traffic controller, making things even more competitive between these two individuals. The two soon begin efforts to try to impress the other, in and outside the job. \tThe personal battles between Nick and Russell soon put each of them in bed with the opposite's wife. Nick is the first to commit adultery when he falls for Bell's highly attractive young wife, Mary. While he meant well, by taking her out for dinner after observing Mary sobbing at the grocery store, when they got home, things obviously got out of hand.  \tThe movie is very detailed both in the workplace and in its colorful, intriguing characters. The original tasting flavor of being placed in an air traffic control tower is quite captivating. The characters stare at the plane monitors like children at a television screen while playing a video game. The characters themselves are relevant, ordinary people, which is why they are so easy to relate to. Even though some of their personalities and motives are instantly obvious, we still have lots of fun watching their everyday living style\tWhile some comedies would eventually regulate into a formalistic climax and follow predictable events, Pushing Tin is too smart for that. The ending is happy and light hearted, but it's most of the fun getting there. Mike Newell, director of Four Weddings and a Funeral, knows exactly what he wants out of the actors here, and they do exceedingly well at giving what he requires. Each fits their character perfectly, especially Cusack, Jolie, and contributing an Oscar worthy performance, Thornton.\tPushing Tin offers a variety of  characters and contrasts them effortlessly. In particular, during a just-for-fun basketball game, Nick makes a sudden bet for $100 that Russell can not make a hoop from a certain point in the court. Russell excepts. Nick nervously changes his gamble to fifty cents, but Russell stands firmly on the original amount. He shoots...and misses. Close enough, Russell, pardons Nick, Lets call it even. Russell walks over to him manly and states You either make it or you don't, as he hands Nick the cash promised. The chemistry between these characters is as effective as pouring oil in to water. And that is exactly how it is designed to be.Brought to you by 20th Century Fox.

If you haven't heard of this controversial film yet, it deals with religion, in particular the teachings of the bible, and as a result will invariably offend some people. Especially with the way this movie portrays religion.Dogma is a story about two angels (Ben Affleck and Matt Damon) who were banished from heaven by God for some past mischievous acts. In a desperate attempt to get back into heaven, the two angels planned to exploit a loophole in God's teachings by passing through the arches of a church in New Jersey on a particular day. However if they are successful in doing this, they will inadvertently erase the existence of man and everything God created by proving that God is not perfect. In an attempt to stop this, God's messenger (Alan Rickman) recruits the help of a special mortal (Linda Fiorentino) to prevent the two angels from reaching New Jersey and passing through the arches of the church. Along the way Fiorentino meets up with two bumbling prophets (Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith - director) and Rufus, the 13th Apostle (Chris Rock) who help her in her quest.If you were expecting a fancy Hollywood movie, you'll be disappointed. This has the feel and look of a low budget B movie but in this case, special effects and bright lights weren't needed. The humor was laced throughout and quite funny and the cast was very good, especially Rickman's character. The only thing that I question was the director's (Kevin Smith) choice for God. I realize he wanted to show that God is not this serious being but a fun loving deity but I found having Alanis Morissette portray God completely irritating.As a warning to anyone who wants to see this movie, there is an incredible amount of foul language and sexual dialogue. This may be the source of many people's dislike for this movie as it is combining religion and toilet humor together but it definitely makes for an entertaining time.Overall, I liked this movie. It took a very serious topic and showed to everyone that it is not necessary to take religion so rigidly, nor should it be the end all and be all of how you live. My suggestion though is that if religion is something that you take very seriously then don't see this movie. However if you approach this movie with an open mind, you will find it funny and entertaining.

This colorful sci-fi action spoof is also a marked contrast to Besson's previous films La Femme Nikita and Leon (known as The Professional here in the States), but does share some similarities with them.  Much like Nikita and Leon have a distinctive French style to them (even though the latter is set in the U.S.), The Fifth Element takes a lot of stylistic cues from French and Japanese comic books, both of which I'm a fan of, particularly Moebius (who contributed some designs to The Fifth Element) and Shirow Masamune (speaking of which, watch for a volume of the excellent Yakuza (Japanese for gangster) comic Sanctuary in Korben Dallas' apartment).The film isn't set so much in the future, more of a futurized comic book version of the world that Nikita and Leon are set in.  I always find futuristic worlds that are still grappling with contemporary problems more interesting, maybe that's part of why I've never found the utopian world of Star Trek very interesting.From my understanding, Besson wrote an early draft of the story in high school (along with an early draft of the under-appreciated The Big Blue), which I think is cool, since I can relate, because in school, I had (as of yet, unrealized) dreams of being a filmmaker, and I would often draw cartoons or write stories to help relieve the tedium of high school.  Of course, most of them were crap, and have no chance in hell of ever being made into a film.Besson has a wonderful visual style, here, it's very interesting to see him apply that style to a sci-fi world rather than a contemporary world (as in his films from Subway to Leon) or a bleak post-apocalypse world (as in the lesser known than it should be Le Dernier Combat).  Of course, credit is also due to production designer Dan Weil and cinematographer Thierry Arbogast (Arbogast's cinematography was one of the few redeeming features of the dismal Wing Commander).  Along with John Woo, Luc Besson is my favorite action director (they may have a three-way tie with the Wachowski brothers if they make more films like The Matrix). Eric Serra's excellent musical score is also worth mentioning.  I really enjoyed seeing Gary Oldman repeat his villain role from Leon, although in this film, his character is more cartoonish than evil.  I also really like a lot of the visual humor Besson included, like the cigarettes that are 3\/4ths filter, and the well-edited sequence when the jet is taking of for Flosthon Paradise.A couple of complaints though, I would've liked to see Jean Reno play Korben Dallas, not that Bruce Willis did a bad job.  I wonder if Reno was originally cast for the part, but backed out.  Reno is one of my favorite actors, I could really imagine him in the role.  Another thing, I've never found Milla Jovovich's fight scene very believable, maybe I'm just spoiled from having seen so many kung fu movies, particularly the newer ones, like with Jet Li.  There are also a few plot holes and lapses in logic, but I choose not to worry about them too much, this isn't a film to take seriously or over-analyze.  I say if you can't enjoy the occasional silly action flick (like this one, which succeeds admirably on that level), you're taking life too seriously.
