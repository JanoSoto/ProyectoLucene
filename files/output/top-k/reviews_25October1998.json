Her dark eyes and pure acting ability make her perfect for this role as the girl who likes everyone and does all she can for those she loves. Nicole Kidman (Gillian, Sally's sister) gave her best performance to date. She showed facial expression and a glare in her eyes in an amazingly wide range of emotion....from sultry to fearful to demonic and to pure loving. She won my admiration in this film as a great actress. Stockard Channing (Aunt Frances)dragged me right into the screen. I almost became her character. Her character is that of a loving aunt witch who teaches the greatest lesson by leaving the younger witches to fend for themselves.....only until her help is absoloutely required (the most challenging behavior for any parent). The sisters separate when Gillian runs off with an abusive man as Sally falls deeply for a local man and begins a fantastic family life having a wonderful husband and two daughters that resemble herself and her sister. There is trouble and this is where we begin to feel for the characters. Humor, family values, wild youth, abuse, love, hate, fear...it's all here in this great film. One fantastically fun scene occurs when the aunt witches appear to brew up some concoction for a spell when suddenly the nieces shout Margaritas. They all dance to The lime in the coconut and the entire theater is rocking with this fun time!

This is a beautiful statement, one that should be lauded.  But it is also one that should be tempered with responsibility and reason.Tobey Maguire plays the proverbial Adam, a boy that loves everything to do with the 'pleasant' world of forties and fifties television, until he and his sister, Reese Witherspoon who plays the also proverbial Eve, are zapped into the television world of Pleasantville.In this world, everything is black and white, until Eve feeds the apple to an unsuspecting boy.  As his desire is aroused, color appears in the world. Soon, all the kids are doing it...literally, at the ridiculously named 'Lover's Lane'.  More and more color appears, and yet, strangely enough nobody gets pregnant.The mother of Adam and Eve, played by Joan Allen, is Mrs. Cleaver to a 'T', until her daughter teaches her about sex.

Gary Ross, who previously wrote Dave and Big, both of which were excellent comedies as well as being timely moral statements, has now crossed the line.Not in filmic terms, but in morality.It's obvious that Ross is making a statement about the inherent freedom within everyone from Adam and Eve right down to people within the world of television.  This is a beautiful statement, one that should be lauded.  But it is also one that should be tempered with responsibility and reason.Tobey Maguire plays the proverbial Adam, a boy that loves everything to do with the 'pleasant' world of forties and fifties television, until he and his sister, Reese Witherspoon who plays the also proverbial Eve, are zapped into the television world of Pleasantville.In this world, everything is black and white, until Eve feeds the apple to an unsuspecting boy.  As his desire is aroused, color appears in the world. Soon, all the kids are doing it...literally, at the ridiculously named 'Lover's Lane'.  More and more color appears, and yet, strangely enough nobody gets pregnant.The mother of Adam and Eve, played by Joan Allen, is Mrs. Cleaver to a 'T', until her daughter teaches her about sex.  After having been taught, the mother proclaims that the father would never to THAT, to which the evil Eve says, There are other ways to find pleasure.  To the mother, this means more than just masturbating in the bathtub.  She leaves her home and family without even speaking with her husband and the only after math that we see is that food is not on the table.In the end, the normal people of Pleasantville must somehow come to terms with the 'coloreds'.  But what of consequence?  The only true evil in the film comes by way of the males who refuse to partake in the world of color. They burn books, rape women, and are generally Hitler-esque.In Ross's world, color means free will.  The freedom to do whatever you please.  This is truly an amazing thing that human beings possess, but this gift we have is tempered by the fact that we have consequences for every action that we indulge in.In Pleasantville, there are no consequences.In the ancient allegory, when Adam and Eve were cast out of the 'black and white' Garden of Eden, they were sent into the world we know too well.

Elizabeth is an historical drama about Elizabeth 1, the virgin queen, known as the most unwelcome royal daughter of English History; the bastard daughter of King Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn. Elizabeth came to the throne in 1533 on the death of Queen (Bloody) Mary. The tussle between the Protestants and the Catholics was in full swing. Elizabeth was a Protestant, was week politically and in experience and was enticed to marry into one of the nearby waring nations to consolidate the power of England. Elizabeth had seen her mother and her stepmother (Katherine Howard) murdered and was well in line for an early death herself. That she survived and went on to reign with some strength in England for 45 years, and that she never married, lends this royal as a worthy topic for bio pics! Elizabeth R, an excellent 6  part, 1971 TV mini-series has already introduced us to a ferociously strong performance as Elizabeth by Glenda Jackson and to just one version of what Elizabeth was really like. Australian Cate Blanchett has defined, with every bit as much force as the great Glenda Jackson, another fascinating and powerfully realised Elizabeth. Cate Blanchett is a product of the strong Sydney Belvoir Street Theatre and really stuns as Elizabeth.

Elizabeth was directed by The Bandit Queen's Shekhar Kapur, a cross cultural choice that has produced a challenging production; a film that is full of both intrigue and mayhem as well as a mesmerising, almost distracting beauty. So we have the butchery that stood for politics in 16th century England displayed against beautifully lit interiors and all of the accoutrements of historical drama.

But sometimes we humans can get just a little bit too clever, or perhaps not smart enough, and Antz, although commendable, has neither the fantasy element needed for a good children's film, nor the realism needed for a decent adults flick. Antz is pretty entertaining, and visually it is every bit as stunning as Toy Story, although Antz is more sophisticated and  has a much darker look than the suburban Toy Story.  As you can imagine, much of the action in Antz takes place underground. Antz tells of an ant called Z (voiced by Woody Allen) who doesn't want to just be one of the crowd. He has an illicit romance with a princess ant (Sharon Stone) and they break the mould and come into conflict with the status quo. There are heaps of references to politics, movie genres, sexual angst and therapy, as you'd expect from a story  starring a Woody Allen type off character. But can an animated film effectively portray complicated emotions? Not so far it seems. The ants in Antz have faces that are almost human, but that then becomes disappointing, because so far the craft hasn't got any where near being able to really display the complexities of a human face.We love faces. We spend our lives studying the extremely subtle messages a tiny tremor of an eyebrow or lip might portray; to such an extent that we often don't even consciously realise how subtle we are as observers. If film makers are going to step towards trying to depict real human faces on animated creatures, and not leave animated films where they have been so far; a film world where it is obvious that the creatures, the faces, and the personalities are only two dimensional and shallow, then they will continue to disappoint movie goers.

While this film may not be comparable to People's earlier sci-fi classic Blade Runner, it is my opinion that it is a great break from the watered-down, contrived, and very obviously foolish films that populate the genre.

Mickler is intrigued by this person, and takes him under professional supervision.  The psychiatrist is intrigued with this caped character, and wants to find out exactly who he is.  And that is the central question of the whole movie - who exactly is this person who claims to be Don Juan DeMarco, the greatest lover in the world?In fact, this Don Juan seems to be so like his fictitious counterpart that Mickler becomes absorbed in his patient's story.  During therapy, amazing tales emerge of a debonair, charming individual with an exotic and colourful past.  Don Juan is depressed because although he has wooed hundreds of women all over the world, he has been rejected by the only one he has ever truly loved.  Complete with an accent and dark good looks, Don Juan could easily be right out of the pages of fiction.While his patient's story is unfolding at work, we also follow an interesting parallel regarding Mickler's domestic life.

Don Juan is depressed because although he has wooed hundreds of women all over the world, he has been rejected by the only one he has ever truly loved.  Complete with an accent and dark good looks, Don Juan could easily be right out of the pages of fiction.While his patient's story is unfolding at work, we also follow an interesting parallel regarding Mickler's domestic life.  We can see an interesting effect observed by very few Hollywood films, and that is not the effect of therapist on patient, but the effect of patient on therapist.Depp and Brando are talented actors who take their parts admirably, and are backed up by a strong supporting cast.  This combination is dynamic in advancing the central theme of the whole film - that of identity. Throughout the film, the characters develop a rich understanding, and the end of the film is both touching and memorable.Blended with genuine humor, very human emotions and a subtle but unmistakable poke at the established Western tradition of psychiatry, Don Juan DeMarco is a splendid and compelling film.  Any film fan will find what they are looking for here, from the lover of romance to the comedy connoisseur, or those who are just looking for something a little different from the norm.  To anyone who has ever loved or been loved, I would heartily recommend this film.

Not only is it suspenseful, exciting and somewhat funny at the right times, Edward himself delivers a believable performance as Jeff Matthews, a 14 year old who has just lost his mother in a freak accident.He has just moved to Maine with his father into a creepy old town known infamously for it's so-called Pet Semetary.Furlong is adorable and the rest of the cast (which inlude Anthony Edwards of ER as Jeff's father and Jason McGuire as Jeff's overweight school friend) are brilliant, tying the story together to its predictable climax that you don't mind sitting through. Clancy Brown plays the ghoolish Gus, Jeff's friend's stepfather who is hilariously creepy both before and after his trip to the semetary. Although this movie doesn't connect much to the Creeds, of the original Stephen King Pet Sematary film, it makes a great new story and an enjoyable sequel. In addition, this movie has a killer soundtrack and as I see it, has already become somewhat of a Fall tradition.

I gather it was primarily a post-Civil War ghost-story, but the frequent scenes of vomiting, drooling, profuse bleeding, urinating, breaking water at childbirth, crying, breast milk squirting, a dog's eyeballs knocked from it's skull, and a lunatic girl shoveling wet cornmeal into her mouth was bewildering to me.I didn't stay for the credits -- being eager to get out of a theatre seat after three fatiguing hours -- but I'll wager that Harpo productions does not employ a film editor. I thought the movie had ended three times, but it just seemed to go on for another twenty minutes each time all of which seemed to add nothing to the plot or the bizarre finale.I'm stumped as to what I was supposed to have been seeing.The only thing 'Beloved' does have going for it is cinematography.

Although not written by Allen, his dialogue resembles that found in classics such as Annie Hall, etc. His sharp wit carries a movie that is otherwise lackluster and dull.The movie, unfortunately, has a rather deficient plot. It is merely a poorly constructed communist diatribe masquerading as a fun, family film.Allen's character, Z, is thrust into the role of Marxist leader after accidentally kidnapping the Queen's daughter, who is, for some reason, engaged to an ant general. The writers, while trying to create a realistic ant colony atmosphere, seem to have forgotton that queen ants' larva are fertilized by many male ants, and have no meaningful relationship with any one.It is decided that Z is a great leader, because he refuses to accept his role as a worker. It seems that the ant rulers are horrible, oppressive autocrats who have enslaved the entire colony, imposing their will upon the voiceless workers. Phrases such as the workers control the means of production are uttered as the ant colony tries to expel the evil General.Z repeatedly declares that is is essential for ants to be allowed to think individually, and that an ant's status ought not be determined at birth.Eventually, of course, the workers triumph over the evil General, and a just society is supposely established. Ironically, they achieve their sovereignty by forming a large ladder, comprised of unidentifiably, generic ants. In the end we see the great ant colony, in which individuality is prized and freedom prevails.
