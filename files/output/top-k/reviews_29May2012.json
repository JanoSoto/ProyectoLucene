[{"date":"29 May 2012","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" This is one of the most famous films of all time, the oldest surviving vampire film in the world, his director's most famous work, one of greatest and best known films of German Expressionism, and without question, one of the best horror films ever made and which set the standards for all the vampire films that have been made ever since. I know that many people are immediately put off by the fact that it is a silent film, but I would ask them to put that prejudice aside for ninety-three minutes, and give it a try. They eventually may not like it still, but still they got nothing to lose. In order to watch Nosferatu with a keen eye and to appreciate it in full as it deserves, some previous research is essential. Yes, it is an adaptation of the novel Dracula, and as to why the names both geographical as well as the characters' are German in some editions, the answer is that Murnau and his producer didn't acquire the copyrights of the novel for purely financial reasons, and they thought they could make a pirate adaptation and get away with it. They did the first thing, but didn't achieve the second, for Bram Stoker's widow sued for plagiarism when she heard of the existence of Nosferatu, and the court ordered all the existing copies to be destroyed without question. Fortunately a few survived, and by the Thirties, after the death of Mrs. Stoker, the ban ceased to be and the film could be publicly screened again. But the copies shown to the public had been chopped down to sixty-five minutes, leaving a film filled with massive plot holes and discontinuity that weighted it down terribly and caused the negative feelings that many spectators still feel about it. I myself experienced that when I acquired a VHS copy recorded from some TV channel, with English subtitles translated into Spanish by a voice-over, in plain black and white with lots of dirt spots in the negative and a murderous visual quality. Still, that was the only way to watch it before the arrival of DVD technology. Then ten years ago I attended a screening at the Curzon Soho cinema on the 80th anniversary of the film, and there I saw the restored Nosferatu for the first time, noticing the immense difference that the original 93 minutes make to the film. Not only everything makes now much more sense, but we can see that, except for minor changes in the action, the film is one of the most faithful adaptations of Stoker's novel. To me personally it also is, with Terence Fisher's Dracula of 1958, the best adaptation ever made to this day. Still, viewers ought to be aware that there are several different editions on sale on DVD, with prices varying between five pounds and twenty, and not all of them are the restored version. Obviously, the cheaper ones are just copies of the old VHS, so here we go back to the same problem we used to have in the past. The reason for this is that Nosferatu nowadays belongs to the public domain, which means anyone can edit a copy and put it for sale without infringing any original copyrights. This is what a few video companies just have done, recycling the old material they already had, regardless to quality and to the fact that they are selling only two-thirds of the film. Other editions bring the full-length cut, but still they present other deficiencies such as plain black and white cinematography -the original negative by Murnau was tinted- and the wrong soundtrack. I watched one of those versions once, which had an electronic score with vocal sounds in the background that would be more typical of modern slasher films and sounded absolutely terrible in Nosferatu. To my knowledge, the only version to watch for someone who is looking for the real thing and wants to own a piece of film history, is the one available in the Masters of Cinema series, restored by the F.W.Murnau-Stiftung foundation and the film scholar Luciano Berriatua. It comes with the original tinted print, the original 1922 score and the original inter-titles design, as well as a long documentary on Murnau and a book that analyses the film thoroughly. It is not cheap, certainly, but it is the definitive Nosferatu DVD if you love the film like I do. For first-time viewers who want to have a go at it, I would suggest to watch it in the Internet first. But again, avoid any version under 90 minutes if you want to see the real film.

It's mind boggling how much mileage this movie got out of its crappy, clichéd plot and annoying floaty fight scenes. The movie critics who gushed over this movie wouldn't know a great martial arts scene if they were karate chopped to the face with it. Before I saw this movie, I heard about how it had not only how it had a great epic plot, but also had excellent fight scenes. This movie has neither.Let's talk about all of the floating. There is no gravity in this movie. The fight scenes have as much in common as footage of man walking on the moon as they do with the fight scenes in truly great martial arts movies. Ang Lee went crazy with wire tricks. Half of this movie is spent with people floating around on wires. Somebody takes a gentle jump off of the ground and floats across the room. It's ridiculous. When I saw this movie in the theater, there were numerous audible laughs from the audience at all of the unintentionally funny floating.To make matters worse, the fight scenes are mostly a waste of time. There is no drama or plot advancement to them. For any action scene to work, there has to be a point to it. The good guy kills the bad guy and we rejoice, or the bad guy kills the good guy and we cry. Every great action scene in the history cinema has had some influence on the plot. Whoever made the dozens of cheap, cheesy Kung Fu movies that I watched on late night TV as a kid understood this. Ang Lee apparently doesn't. In many scenes, two people float around an arena fighting for five minutes, and nothing happens. You know that neither of them will get hurt, so from the beginning, it's a complete waste of time. This, unfortunately, is an epidemic in action movies nowadays. Action scenes seem like more of a tool to show off CGI or cinematography than to advance the plot in an exciting way.This movie's plot is laughable. It easily ranks among the worst of any martial arts movie that I have ever seen. It's just a tired old cliché about an old master wanting to guide a young arrogant whippersnapper, with some I want revenge on you because you killed my master thrown in for good measure. The characters don't behave realistically and by the time that you are halfway, you won't even care what happens to them. When I first saw this movie, I almost felt like a practical joke had been played on me. I walked out of the theater saying wow, is that it? If this movie had been made in the 1970s with cheesy dubbing instead of subtitles, nobody would be giving it the praise that it has received. This is why I have labeled this movie as a martial arts movie loved by people who normally don't like martial arts movies. People who see this movie don't realize that they are getting an old cheesy film on artistic steroids.Do you want to see some great martial arts? Go to Wal-Mart and see if you can find some really cheap DVDs of old Chinese films from the 70s and 80s. Or, check out some Jackie Chan or Jet Li movies on Netflix. For a modern combination of great action and drama, I highly recommend Jet Li's Fearless. One of half a dozen fight scenes in that movie produce more adrenaline than all of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, and its simple plot works really well too. If you normally wouldn't be caught dead watching a movie like that, then maybe you'll get something out of this one.

As the movie continues Jack & Rose starts to meet up regularly at the different parts of the ship, while on the other hand Rose mother & her fiancé Cal doesn't like Rose spending time with lower class standard jack, but still young hearts were attracted to each other. The best scene in the movie according to me is the flying scene of Jack & Rose, which makes rose realize that she is in love with Jack too. The movie takes sudden turns when on the same night titanic hits the iceberg, which in short left my eyes wide open, as it has been directed & executed very well, & then the final chapter of the maiden voyage beings the sinking of the unsinkable titanic. The final hour of the movie filled with reality & the disaster which people till now hasn't forgotten.

Some true scenes like the Creator of titanic Thomas Andrews died while standing near the dining clock & was last seen, the steamer falling on the jacks brother, third class traveler's were treated during the sinking scenes. The breaking apart of ship are the most shattering scenes in the movie. There is no doubt even today in 2012 still I wonder what James Cameron has achieved in the special effects put into this movie, the year 1997 the worked on their best special effects effort to keep this movie alive even for the upcoming generation to watch on. The soul of the movie is the background score of this motion picture which is composed by James Horner every piece of music is been composed specially to suit the scenes of this movie itself, from the opening sequence to de-porting of titanic to Rose theme & the sinking sequence. James Cameron specially recorded the score of the movie with real orchestra the team of James Horner. In one the interviews of the making of Avatar one of the viewer asked him  what if you get a chance to direct Titanic again, what would be your experience in making it  ?? and he answer if I would have been given a change to direct titanic again, I will finish titanic within a month very easily cause of hugely availability of special effects team, cause for titanic I had to wait for some shot for days. For example the shot of Rose & Jack on the front end of the ship kissing each other, he had to wait for days to get proper sunset in the camera as special effects that time weren't that advanced like how they are today. In one word you're a legend Cameron. The wreck shot of ship were taken in the year 1995 2 years before the releasing the movie into theaters. Till now whenever I watch this movie I still feel I'm watching it for the first time & somewhere there are tears in my eyes specially in the scene where rose steps into the life boats & Jacks watches her going away, oh geez that particular scene gets tears in my eyes every time. I am now waiting for the special edition of this movie to be released in 3d blu-ray. True facts about TITANIC Titanic was constructed to be unsinkable ship of that time, but the creator of the ship Thomas made 3 biggest mistakes in constructing the ship. The propeller of the ship were taken directly from the design of the 18's century cruise liner, the water tight compartments had one the major flaws which over flowed the water from the upper decks, the propellers turning radius was not designed to turn ship quickly as the ship size was way bigger than the propellers could bear it during the full stern. On the night of sinking titanic received 5 iceberg warning, but still they ignored the warning & continue sailing. The final decision by the Mr Murdoch to reverse the engines & turning the ship to evade iceberg. The decision not to carry enough life boats cause it ruins the overall look of the top deck & it was initially decided to carry just 8 life boats, but later on more 12 boats were added. The distress call from titanic was actually received by the local streamer waiting for the morning to sail again couldn't reach for help as the streamer couldn't see the titanic as the sky was full of twinkling stars which interrupted the them to see through binoculars.The crew lost their binoculars on the night ship hitted the iceberg.My rating &#x96; 10\/10 !!!!!!!

As the movie continues Jack & Rose starts to meet up regularly at the different parts of the ship, while on the other hand Rose mother & her fiancé Cal doesn't like Rose spending time with lower class standard jack, but still young hearts were attracted to each other. The best scene in the movie according to me is the flying scene of Jack & Rose, which makes rose realize that she is in love with Jack too. The movie takes sudden turns when on the same night titanic hits the iceberg, which in short left my eyes wide open, as it has been directed & executed very well, & then the final chapter of the maiden voyage beings the sinking of the unsinkable titanic. The final hour of the movie filled with reality & the disaster which people till now hasn't forgotten. People struggling to survive & the real history how traveler's were saved into the life boats are the key scenes of the movie. Some true scenes like the Creator of titanic Thomas Andrews died while standing near the dining clock & was last seen, the steamer falling on the jacks brother, third class traveler's were treated during the sinking scenes. The breaking apart of ship are the most shattering scenes in the movie. There is no doubt even today in 2012 still I wonder what James Cameron has achieved in the special effects put into this movie, the year 1997 the worked on their best special effects effort to keep this movie alive even for the upcoming generation to watch on. The soul of the movie is the background score of this motion picture which is composed by James Horner every piece of music is been composed specially to suit the scenes of this movie itself, from the opening sequence to de-porting of titanic to Rose theme & the sinking sequence. James Cameron specially recorded the score of the movie with real orchestra the team of James Horner. In one the interviews of the making of Avatar one of the viewer asked him  what if you get a chance to direct Titanic again, what would be your experience in making it  ?? and he answer if I would have been given a change to direct titanic again, I will finish titanic within a month very easily cause of hugely availability of special effects team, cause for titanic I had to wait for some shot for days. For example the shot of Rose & Jack on the front end of the ship kissing each other, he had to wait for days to get proper sunset in the camera as special effects that time weren't that advanced like how they are today. In one word you're a legend Cameron. The wreck shot of ship were taken in the year 1995 2 years before the releasing the movie into theaters. Till now whenever I watch this movie I still feel I'm watching it for the first time & somewhere there are tears in my eyes specially in the scene where rose steps into the life boats & Jacks watches her going away, oh geez that particular scene gets tears in my eyes every time. I am now waiting for the special edition of this movie to be released in 3d blu-ray. True facts about TITANIC Titanic was constructed to be unsinkable ship of that time, but the creator of the ship Thomas made 3 biggest mistakes in constructing the ship. The propeller of the ship were taken directly from the design of the 18's century cruise liner, the water tight compartments had one the major flaws which over flowed the water from the upper decks, the propellers turning radius was not designed to turn ship quickly as the ship size was way bigger than the propellers could bear it during the full stern. On the night of sinking titanic received 5 iceberg warning, but still they ignored the warning & continue sailing. The final decision by the Mr Murdoch to reverse the engines & turning the ship to evade iceberg. The decision not to carry enough life boats cause it ruins the overall look of the top deck & it was initially decided to carry just 8 life boats, but later on more 12 boats were added. The distress call from titanic was actually received by the local streamer waiting for the morning to sail again couldn't reach for help as the streamer couldn't see the titanic as the sky was full of twinkling stars which interrupted the them to see through binoculars.The crew lost their binoculars on the night ship hitted the iceberg.My rating &#x96; 10\/10 !!!!!!!

I felt so claustrophobic even in my living room. I could almost sense the pressure closing in on me when the boat went below crush-depth - at one point I went out to my garage to make sure I had plenty of wood for shoring. And then when the boat started rocking and rolling in seas-state-oh-my-God, I broke out my puke-bag in order to join the crew in their vomit-orchestra.

It's one of those movies, along with The Seventh Seal, that discuss the theme of a meaningful journey, covered with existential dilemmas and spiritual moralities. Dr. Isaak Borg, an old and very acclaimed professor, is about to travel from Stockholm to Lund in order to receive an honorary degree. Normally he would've taken the plane, but due to a eerie dream that haunted him the previous night he starts to reminisce about his whole life, and finally decides to ride there by car, just to have some time for himself and those piercing thoughts of various matters. Yet, along with him comes his daughter-in-law Marianne. In a series of honest exchange of views Isaak realizes how meaningless and full of void his life has been up to this point. He shut out all of the relationship that he had and concentrated only on his selfish life made up of hard work and materialistic needs. Even though he achieved respect in the scientific world, in the humanity's entity he has been dead for a long time now. Emotionless and cold- as-ice, he wasn't able to take care of any person that longed for his attention.Somewhere along the road they stop at the house where Isaak grew up. His hazy memory shows him a few scenes from his early life, and how really bitter and depressing it has been. Without love and warmth, even from the girl he wanted to marry, he blocked his deepest emotions and became as ruthless as the people he was surrounded by. And it all passes down in the family, as it seems that his son is as heartless and dismal as his father. Thoughts of death occur on a daily basis, as if the pain of being alive was too hard to bear. It's really paradoxical, that the only people that ever thought of him as a nice and friendly man were those, who didn't know him one bit the family at the gas station, and the three young people he took along on the ride.Bergman placed them fantastically in the story to present a sharp contrast between the cheerful young fellows and a sorrowful, nearly dead, old man contemplating his empty life. There is also a notion of the existence of God that those three characters bring onto the screen.It's as if Bergman wanted to evaluate Borg's fatalism with contradicting it with the possibilities of an afterlife. His body is still functioning, but in the spiritual meaning he is long gone.On the side of cinematography, this divine problem is also brilliantly shown by the nightmare that haunted Borg that night. He stands on a street, in a place devoid of time, where people melt and die. Then comes the metaphorical black stagecoach carrying a coffin with Borg inside. Is he still alive, or is he dead? An image that would scary anyone, I suppose.In the end apart from deep empathy I somehow felt happy, as the final scenes provide some kind of a reprieve for Borg. Even though he lead a life of emptiness and was never kind to anyone, and valued death over life itself, at the end of the day he finally caught a glimpse of what real remorse may feel like.

Sure, there are tons of differences between the original Broadway Lorelei (Carol Channing) and the sultry Marilyn, but the role of Lorelei Lee dates back to a play and a silent movie of the 1920's, straight from the Best Selling story of the not-so-dumb blonde and her pal Dorothy. Having seen two stage versions of this (Los Angeles 2002 with Alice Ripley and Valarie Pettiford; New York 2012 with Megan Hilty and Rachel York) and having had the pleasure of seeing this at the anniversary of Chinese Grauman's Theatre (with Jane Russell present), I actually prefer the character of Dorothy, but find it funny that the brunette (who gets the husband in Anita Loos's follow-up) is constantly overlooked. In all of the versions I've seen, I find that it is Dorothy who has the heart, is less of a female, and undoubtedly more of a catch. No offense against Lorelei; She is fun; It's just Dorothy who gets my vote.The movie is a bit different than the Broadway show, especially the absence of most of its songs. The replacements aren't bad, but with Jule Styne as composer, why replace them in the first place? The story of the tiara bought by Lorelei with money borrowed from the husband of the tiara's owner is intact, and hysterically funny, with Charles Coburn (I say!) delightful as the hot under the collar Lord whose imperious wife (Norma Varden) really means business. Then why are you wearing that hat?, Russell snidely asks her. Some of the characters names remain the same as in the stage production, but the name of the little boy who helps Lorelei out of a porthole was actually an adult whom Dorothy chases in the play.Both Monroe and Russell are truly likable, and from the moment the show opens, their duet of Two Little Girls from Little Rock (just one on stage) sets the tone. Both stars get a chance to shine in the show's most recalled number, two renditions of Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend, Russell's obviously less splashy since hers is just a reprise. Her Ain't There Anyone Here For Love? is an acceptable replacement for the stage I Love What I'm Doin', but its basically just the same song by a different composer and used to show off the muscles of the athletes aboard ship. As a result, it is more campy than show-stopping. Musically for me, the highlight was Bye Bye Baby, while Marilyn's Diamonds is more of a music video inserted into a movie. (Along with Funny Face's Think Pink, I can't think of two musical numbers in movie musicals that qualify as moments in film that influenced the music video industry.) While this may never stand up as a faithful version of the stage show, it does its job quite satisfactorily and the results are mostly pleasing.

Both stars get a chance to shine in the show's most recalled number, two renditions of Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend, Russell's obviously less splashy since hers is just a reprise. Her Ain't There Anyone Here For Love? is an acceptable replacement for the stage I Love What I'm Doin', but its basically just the same song by a different composer and used to show off the muscles of the athletes aboard ship. As a result, it is more campy than show-stopping. Musically for me, the highlight was Bye Bye Baby, while Marilyn's Diamonds is more of a music video inserted into a movie. (Along with Funny Face's Think Pink, I can't think of two musical numbers in movie musicals that qualify as moments in film that influenced the music video industry.) While this may never stand up as a faithful version of the stage show, it does its job quite satisfactorily and the results are mostly pleasing. Just give Jane a break, and view the film from Dorothy's perspective for once.

It is definitely worth making some time to watch. It is still applicable to a lot of viewers even in this generation.Positives  The movie's main theme focuses a lot on uncertainty and worry about one's future. This is problem that every person has gone through, especially high school and college aged young adults. Not knowing what to do with your life and not being motivated are huge problems for people, especially those is the previously mentioned age bracket. The movie is fairly tame when it comes to sex, violence, and profanity, and yet it still is very relate-able to even modern young adults and teenagers because of this central theme. I also think it was very comical movie. Ben, played by Dustin Hoffman, was unbearably awkward and embarrassed. It's very funny watching him deal with all the situations he is put in. Another thing I like about the movie is the ending. I enjoy how vague it was. You don't know how the couple will end up. It could be a happy ending because they finally get together, or it could be a completely different type of ending, with the characters throwing their lives away for a quick feeling they had.Negative  Falling in love after one date with Elaine, and then stalking her was very creepy and unbelievable. I don't think anyone could really empathize with that situation. That part was very difficult to look past and accept. Another problem was (while I love Simon & Garfunkel) I think they overused a lot of the songs in the movie. At first, I thought The Sound Of Silence was utilized very well to compliment the scene in the movie.

Slapstick, to me, is only successful in small doses. Television shows like The Three Stooges or Laurel and Hardy were loaded with plenty of slapstick moments, but they realized that slapstick is only funny if your running time is around half an hour. The Party plays out like one overly done, long drowned-out joke after another. Peter Sellers plays klutzy Indian actor Hrundi V. Bakshi. His performance as lead character is incredibly dull and made worse by his embarrassingly overly done Indian accent and horrible tan. Hrundi is somehow is mistakenly invited to a high-end Hollywood party at a fancy house, which is where all of the humor begins. The ongoing gags seen throughout this film are so horribly run ragged by the end, it becomes painful to watch. One such example is the Butler\/Waiter drinking the beverages he's supposed to be serving to guests. In director Blake Edward's mind, If it's funny the 1st time, it should be funny the 73rd time.Throughout the rest of this 90 minute comedy, you are treated to a barrage of completely nonsensical events that are just as dragged out as the rest of the ongoing gags.

It is certainly an 8 or a 9, I thought, and I've ended up giving it a 9 because every second of this film - from the first to the very last - is riveting and engrossing.Yes, perhaps this reason was what persuaded me to give the 9 rather than the 8 rating - so, so many horror and sci-fi films begin slowly, with action not occurring until 30 or 40 minutes into the film. In other words, the first 1\/3 or so of the film is spent in characterization, setting, and building up the conflict.

I have seen these types of kissing scenes between two men done much better in other films, but at the same time this film is dated 1987, so that might be part of it since kissing styles evolve each decade in movies.

The narrative is straightforward and rather inevitable. First of all, the film never fail to keep the appearance engaging and captivating while bypassing a severe flaw in its avowed mantra, it always takes two persons to exert an immoral affair, but eventually the punishment usually always falls on the woman, even grants a pretext of psychopath, a tacky happy ending does fling an anticlimax and one might find himself stuck in a moot situation, who we should feel more sympathetic? So, the moral support is preferably unstable, the film fulfills an educational motive and emblematizes itself as an immaculate prototype of monogamic conformity and a wake-up call to warn all the horny married-man. However the real gem lies in the sterling cast, which has been against all odds to generate a great deal of fidelity to stimulate the flares of lust, possession and destruction (frilled with a somewhat pretentious family value). Close and Archer both received their Oscar nominations, Lyne's female fixation works out properly and both actresses manage to wrestle with their largely conventional roles and excel themselves in a better-than-expected anticipation. Close is on her best form in portraying the maniac other woman, with a menacing charisma until the breakdown. Douglas is typecast and stays put in his comfort zone. The set pieces are sturdily devised even though it seems to be a lowdown trick involving an ambiguous pregnancy, nevertheless the finale showdown is masterfully done, the bathroom confrontation has a thoroughgoing suspense and marks the genuine craftsmanship from director Adrian Lyne.So a 6\/10 is a medium rating which is hampered by an outmoded moral criterion judging by the opinions of today, but still a pleasant piece of work worthy of more attention.

The heart of the picture covers the taking of a grassy hill protected by Japanese bunkers; but that's only the surface of The Thin Red Line, as this isn't a normal war flick in the least.The film features an all-star cast with cameos by the likes of John Travolta and George Clooney. Nick Nolte shines as the gung-ho Col. Tall, who wants to take the hill ASAP whatever the cost. This is his first war engagement and he lusts for glory. Meanwhile softhearted Capt. Staros (Elias Koteas) resists sending his men on an obvious suicide mission and insists on a less-costly strategy to taking the hill.Some of the men are so defiled by the war that they can't feel anything anymore, for example Sgt. Storm, played by John Reilly, whereas a few haven't lost their spiritual bearings, like Pvt. Witt (Jim Caviezel); others are somewhere in between the darkness and the light, e.g. Sgt. Welsh (Sean Penn).Other standouts include Ben Chaplin as Pvt. Bell, who's dearly devoted to a wife who may or may not deserve it (Miranda Otto); Dash Mihok as the incredibly courageous Pfc. Doll, who wildly leads the way in taking the bunkers; and John Cusack as the bold Capt. Gaff, who's simply speechless in the face of Col. Tall's asinine antics.Other notables include Woody Harrelson, Adrien Brody, Jared Leto and Nick Stahl.COMMENTARY As noted above, The Thin Red Line is not a conventional war flick, so stay away if that's the type of movie you want to see. The battle of Guadalcanal is merely a stage for Malick to explore the nature of the human experience and, in fact, life itself. Why is nature at war with itself, from the smallest animals to people? Where does evil come from? What is love? Why do we feel it? Who is the Divine? What is the nature of the Creator? Why are we poisoned by war? What is death and why do we fear it? For that matter, why do we have to die? How can we keep from being defiled by strife and war? Malick shows both the beauty of the world and human existence as well as its horrors. We cannot change the way this world is and must therefore face the inevitable conflicts; the only thing we can control is our response to this ongoing war, like Caviezel's Pvt. Witt.As you can see, the film explores the noblest and darkest reaches of the human heart and experience. As such, it's a picture that keeps giving no matter how many times you've watched it. In other words, it's full of hidden gems to glean with each viewing.In contrast to the contemporaneous Saving Private Ryan, The Thin Red Line has a slow start with an uneventful beach landing; it also has a mellow ending, but the center's full of brutal war horror even while its heart is deeply meditative and reverent. If that sounds like a bunch of mumbo jumbo, see the film and you'll understand what I mean. In the end The Thin Red Line towers alone in the annals of war cinema, a deeply spiritual triumph. There's really nothing else like it.FYI The film was shot on location in Guadalcanal, the Solomon Islands, and Australia and runs 2 hours, 50 minutes.GRADE A ","genre":null},{"date":"29 May 2012","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Terrence Malick's The Thin Red Line (1998) details the experiences of an American platoon during the battle of Guadalcanal in the SW Pacific during December\/January 1942-43.
