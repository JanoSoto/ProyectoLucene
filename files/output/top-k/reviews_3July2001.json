Just watching the previews, you pretty much have a good idea what's going to happen in the end.  But unlike many romantic comedies, this is not predictable by the minute.  The characters are likable and charming, and you get quite engrossed in them.  The actors are charming as well.  Jennifer Lopez and Matthew McCoughnahey are equally good and have a fine chemistry.  The scenes, in general, are handled in a sweet-natured fashion without becoming nauseatingly sentimental.  The opening scene is very original and made me laugh.  In the first scene, we get an idea of how Mary (Lopez) plans her weddings, staging them like a secret service operation, strapping wires to the bride and groom, feeding them suggestions as they walk down the aisle and making sure all the guests are in order pronto.  There are certain moments of sitcom stupidity.  There's a scene where Steve (McCoughnahey) gets his hand stuck to a statue's privates.  The comedy was badly timed and the scene appeared quite lame.  A similar joke was used in Rodney Dangerfield's Meet Wally Sparks, but was done in a much more structured manner and spawned hilarious results.  About the member of the cast who I felt was a little hammy was Alex Rocco as Mary's Sicilian father.  His accent comes and goes, and in some scenes he struggles so much with it that he starts talking like someone with down syndrome.  Fred Willard has a short but funny, scene-stealing role (when hasn't Willard stolen the show?) as a ballroom dance teacher.  There are some moments in the plot that are forced and created simply to move the film along, so we can quickly arrive at the juicy climax.  One of the subplots involves Mary's father trying to fix his daughter up with this silly, thick-accented Sicilian cassanova.  He wants her to get married to him, but she refuses.  Throughout the film, they don't seem to have any more than a friendly bond.  Yet later in the film, he makes a sweet proposal and Mary actually agrees to marry him.  The ending is far-fetched and over-the-top, and though I can't discuss it you've probably seen this ending before.  One thing I have to credit the writers for is refusing to make Fran (Bridgette Wilson-Sampras--Man, is she sooooo beautiful!!!) a total b**ch, like they would in most films of a similiar plot.  The way the formula goes is the guy's engaged this girl, while another girl captures his heart.  But the girl he's engaged to is usually so unlikable that you wonder why he wanted to marry her in the first place.  I'm glad they didn't take that cheap route.  Even Fran has a certain charm to her character.  The charming characters and the charming actors are really what makes this movie worth seeing.  Yes, it's pretty much (though less than usual) a formula romantic comedy, but a likable one because of the way we're captured by the people on screen.  This is not a great film, it has its dull moments, it has its silly moments, but it's often a fun and pleasant movie experience.

Ashley Judd is very good, beautiful and engaging as well.  It's a charming fairy tale -- though one which in its broad outlines has a refreshingly plausible upside ending, rather than the incredible long shot sort.One bit of movie trivia -- I love the evocation of Natalie's first very powerful role, as the already charismatic and disturbingly sexy 12 year old informally adopted by a recent immigrant hit man in The Professional, through her huging to herself a large potted plant as she travels into a new home and phase of her life. In each film it's the only emotional tie the young girl really has left at that transition, before she builds up again from rubble.Where the Heart Is has a thoroughly laudable set of messages, and their general outline rings true.  It's all about openness and giving to others, ultimately prevailing over selfishness and irresponsibility. It's about finding the right people for you, even when they might not seem so right at first.  It's about young and not quite so young women learning through life's experiences to finally tell good men from not so good or downright bad men. Further, it's refreshingly set in a geographic and social part of the country, among Oklahoma and Tennesse small town working class whites, that generally gets little attention in the movies.  With captivating and charismatic performances by the beautiful Portman and Judd, and as well in a different way Stockard Channing as the reformed alcoholic earth mother, what's not to like?  It should be a thoroughly winning, if fairly small movie.  Well, partly it is.  Portman and Judd have done their careers no harm, and some good, by this film.  The screenplay, by and large, is good as well.  The trouble is the directing.In its its character portrayal details, this movie is fundamentally false.  How could a young girl as emotionally unclouded, clear and giving, with almost no consuming resentments, come from foster homes, no father, and the thoroughly irrepsonsible and emotionally unreliable and distant mother which Sally Fields portrays in an excellent cameo?   As well, Portman as directed (and maybe cast) just doesn't pull off being nearly illiterate and not so bright very well.  She is obviously highly intelligent in every look and expression she gives.  Judd as well plays too smart for her role.  They are both simply gems too unclouded to be believable in their life circumstance -- especially the older Judd, who has had more time to recover from teenage waywardness.  The result is something more like a fairy tale, than a work of real dramatic truth.  The fault seems the director's, not the actresses. They seem directed to have played unremittingly loveable, rather than real.Novalee would be much more believable if she were significantly wilder, more irresponsible and sexually driven than she is portrayed.  There is some tinge of that, in her early sexy innocence with her baby's father, and the very brief lust at first sight scene with the auto mechanic, but it is very much downplayed (no hot scenes, no compulsions), there is only one such relationship after she is abandoned, and it lasts barely a month.  Why if she wasn't going to keep being pulled in that direction doesn't she much sooner really connect with the young, intelligent and caring, and at least fairly good looking (if not cocky)  Forney -- who early on becomes the effective adoring daddy to the daughter which is the central focus of her life?  Instead it takes more than five years.  Yes, sure, the reasons given -- the spoken one that she doesn't think she's good enough for him, given his college and family background despite his unambiguous interest in her, and the unspoken one that he doesn't seem like enough of a stud to her until she has done some considerable changing and learning some of life's lessons -- together make perfect sense abstractly.  But they don't ring true emotionally in the film.  She seems like a Forney sort of girl in many ways from the get go, and certainly after she has given birth.  We see her learning and growing, but not emotionally or sexually changing all that much.  The fatal attraction for cocky studs just isn't portrayed, at least after she is abandoned in the Walmart parking lot right at the very beginning.Nor do we see what is supposed to be largely the same story actually portrayed by Judd -- rather than explained.  As well, what is with the never married Judd's pumping out the five kids by her early thirties?  The first one sure.  But then she doesn't wise up about female backup birth control?  I'm not saying that never happens.  I'm saying I don't buy that the character portrayed by Judd would have kept doing that, with her self awareness, intelligence and unclouded emotional makeup.  Unless perhaps there are things we aren't really told.  Such as that maybe the kids were really oops pregnancies designed to wring commitment out of a succession of guys that weren't really willing to marry her.  She tells Novalee and hence us that she repeatedly kids herself about the sorts of men she falls for, but it's something we hear about, rather than see in her. In each case the director didn't want to cloud the picture of emotionally perfect, and otherwise highly attractive, female characters slowly emerging from life's bad breaks and their small town working class origins.

As a brief background, I also grew up with the transformers and absolutely loved them as a kid.

Now don't get me wrong, the animation was definitely up to snuff, but come on, they had to be able to do a better job with the story.The idea of a planet eating robot was great, even the idea of killing off some of our favorites, but the ease with which some of them were destroyed compared to others was terrible.  Ironhide was downed in one shot and destroyed with one more.  The other Autobots destroyed along with Ironhide on the shuttle were done in with one shot.  Meanwhile the Dinobots were unscathed later in the movie taking on heavy fire from the Unicron upgraded Decepticons.

What I didn't know at that time was that this was not the movie I was expecting it to be.  I knew it had Haley Joel Osment and that he was a robot boy who looked amazingly real, but that's about it.  I had no idea that the movie began on that premise and was then going to diverge onto every tangent they came across.  With that in mind, the producers did everyone a great favor by not promoting this more heavily.  Had they done so, this would have been the second Pearl Harbor of the year, the movie where everyone was expecting cinematic brilliance and got crap.  Instead, we just got another rotten movie by Steven Spielberg.The story begins like a fairly normal movie, with a family in the midst of a crisis.  Henry and Monica Swinton (Sam Robards and Frances O'Connor) have a son in a coma and things don't look good for his recovery.  Monica isn't handling things well, and when Henry is presented with an opportunity at work, to be the first to have a new robot child, he jumps at the chance to help save Monica's sanity.  David (Haley Joel Osment) becomes their new son, and things go rather smoothly until their real child awakes from his coma. Now there are two kids in the family, and competition ensues for the love of their mother.  When David reads the story of Pinocchio and learns of the fake boy being made real, he makes it his quest to do the same.  The rest of the movie is David's journey to become a real boy, so that he too, can win the love of his mother.Now I know it sounds rather noble and all, but it isn't.  The writers had some great chances to make some great social commentary, or create a movie that could really jerk at your heart strings, but they chose another route. They chose to diverge on every weird tangent they could come across, and the result is disastrous.  The only thing good about this movie is the potential it unleashed with this kind of story, but it never even came close to realizing it.  The best thing that could ever come out of this movie is if David Fincher were to come along and make another movie of a similar nature, that actually lived up to what it could have been.I had heard over and over again that the ending was really out there, but because I liked the weird kind of stuff, I would probably like this one.  I rushed out in a frenzy to watch this, and man was I disappointed.  This isn't a weird ending, this is a totally stupid ending and one that you are totally unprepared for and makes no sense at all.  I have no problem with a movie with an ending that just comes out of nowhere, but with this kind of ending, the movie had no purpose other than to waste two hours of your time. In the immortal lines of Billy Madison, we were all dumber for having watched this movie.The acting was all fine and good, but the story was just awful.  It was like they had a good idea for a movie, but had no idea on where to go with it, so they just picked the strangest scenario that someone could think up.

With that in mind, the producers did everyone a great favor by not promoting this more heavily.  Had they done so, this would have been the second Pearl Harbor of the year, the movie where everyone was expecting cinematic brilliance and got crap.  Instead, we just got another rotten movie by Steven Spielberg.The story begins like a fairly normal movie, with a family in the midst of a crisis.  Henry and Monica Swinton (Sam Robards and Frances O'Connor) have a son in a coma and things don't look good for his recovery.  Monica isn't handling things well, and when Henry is presented with an opportunity at work, to be the first to have a new robot child, he jumps at the chance to help save Monica's sanity.  David (Haley Joel Osment) becomes their new son, and things go rather smoothly until their real child awakes from his coma. Now there are two kids in the family, and competition ensues for the love of their mother.  When David reads the story of Pinocchio and learns of the fake boy being made real, he makes it his quest to do the same.  The rest of the movie is David's journey to become a real boy, so that he too, can win the love of his mother.Now I know it sounds rather noble and all, but it isn't.  The writers had some great chances to make some great social commentary, or create a movie that could really jerk at your heart strings, but they chose another route. They chose to diverge on every weird tangent they could come across, and the result is disastrous.  The only thing good about this movie is the potential it unleashed with this kind of story, but it never even came close to realizing it.  The best thing that could ever come out of this movie is if David Fincher were to come along and make another movie of a similar nature, that actually lived up to what it could have been.I had heard over and over again that the ending was really out there, but because I liked the weird kind of stuff, I would probably like this one.  I rushed out in a frenzy to watch this, and man was I disappointed.  This isn't a weird ending, this is a totally stupid ending and one that you are totally unprepared for and makes no sense at all.  I have no problem with a movie with an ending that just comes out of nowhere, but with this kind of ending, the movie had no purpose other than to waste two hours of your time. In the immortal lines of Billy Madison, we were all dumber for having watched this movie.The acting was all fine and good, but the story was just awful.  It was like they had a good idea for a movie, but had no idea on where to go with it, so they just picked the strangest scenario that someone could think up.  The movie was a big disappointment and gave nothing more than a really cool teddy bear, and a glimpse or two of what could have been one hell of an awesome movie.  My advice is not to bother, because it's not nearly as good as you think it will be.

No matter how much David could wish for his mom and feel something like pain for being away form her he would never, ever be any different because he would never grow old or mature. Anyway, I'm not a science-fiction fan, but this film is more than science-fiction because it asks many questions that make humans learn more about what being alive and human is. I think the acting was great, and both Haley Joel Osment and Jude Law were great. I hoped that the film would have gotten a little bit more adult and had more of Gigolo Joe's world but Spielberg wanted so badly to have his fairy tale that he made everything spin around so he could have his feel-good ending. I don't think this movie is a waste of time. It looks wonderful and has some beautiful (and some creepy) sequences. If this film would  have been made without the summer grossings in mind it could have been an even better film directed towards an older audience.

I watched for an hour or two as they tried to riddle out the mysteries of Leonard Shelby's condition, of his strange trip, and of his connections with his friends. Finally,  I couldn't stand it any more what relevance, I asked, does any of this have to do to the supposed deeper issues that the movie half-heartedly attempts to make us believe that it has raised? No one could tell me precisely, but they assured me that, once I'd thought about the plot and figured out what REALLY happened, I would know.I disagree. I see this movie as the latest installment in Hollywood's latest string of movies which try to sell themselves (and succeed, usually, very well) solely through a thick layer of gimmicks, that is, tricks of the trade that make a movie look cool. Memento has gimmicks galore time moves backwards, in clips of a few minutes each; there is a frenetic and disjointed narration by the main character, repeating key bits of dialogue, mantra-style almost, to drive home his neurotic-ness (which seems to be very cool at the movies these days); there is a confusing plot that's hard to follow; and there is the traditional twist ending.I challenge those who I can already hear complaining that these aren't gimmicks, but essential parts of the plot structure, to ask themselves why these things are so essential in the light of what the movie takes to be its central object, memory. First of all why does the action move backward in time? I could probably come up with some long, convoluted film-school answer to that question, but it wouldn't be a good one. The best answer seems to be because it makes the movie look cool, and because it gives the added benefit of giving us a surprise ending. Since it's probably not a very important gimmick, we should imagine what the movie would be like without it; I think most people wouldn't like nearly as much.While many people are content spending hours trying to figure out Leonard Shelby's shoe size, I personally couldn't care less. What annoys me about films like these is the fact that they're so dishonest; Memento, like Fight Club, American Beauty, and Pleasantville before it, seems, on reflection, to be trying most of all to make people say to themselves, wow! what a smart movie without actually BEING a smart movie. The few incredibly weak philosophical insights (such as the one at the end of the film) convince people that, buried under the convoluted heap of an impossible-to-follow plot, there's actually something deep and worthwhile. The surprise ending only makes this more blatant; Memento, like so many movies today, is aimed at making the viewer want to see it again in order to get it better. But my suspicion is that there's really nothing to get; even Tom Tykwer's Winterschlaffen (Wintersleepers), from which the plot concept for Memento seems to have been lifted, treats the subject better. My suggestion see an honest movie, one that doesn't need plot twists or obscurity to say something interesting or important, like The Seventh Seal, or a movie that uses plot twists and confusion in an honest and compelling way, like Hitchcock's great masterpiece, Vertigo.

I watched for an hour or two as they tried to riddle out the mysteries of Leonard Shelby's condition, of his strange trip, and of his connections with his friends. Finally,  I couldn't stand it any more what relevance, I asked, does any of this have to do to the supposed deeper issues that the movie half-heartedly attempts to make us believe that it has raised? No one could tell me precisely, but they assured me that, once I'd thought about the plot and figured out what REALLY happened, I would know.I disagree. I see this movie as the latest installment in Hollywood's latest string of movies which try to sell themselves (and succeed, usually, very well) solely through a thick layer of gimmicks, that is, tricks of the trade that make a movie look cool. Memento has gimmicks galore time moves backwards, in clips of a few minutes each; there is a frenetic and disjointed narration by the main character, repeating key bits of dialogue, mantra-style almost, to drive home his neurotic-ness (which seems to be very cool at the movies these days); there is a confusing plot that's hard to follow; and there is the traditional twist ending.I challenge those who I can already hear complaining that these aren't gimmicks, but essential parts of the plot structure, to ask themselves why these things are so essential in the light of what the movie takes to be its central object, memory. First of all why does the action move backward in time? I could probably come up with some long, convoluted film-school answer to that question, but it wouldn't be a good one.

At the end, I was confused about more than a few things. The story isn't told in a very clear way. Ichabod's weird dreams distracted me from the story. I also didn't like the way the Horseman was turned into a sort of henchman. Who really cares about who is controlling him? This wasn't supposed to be a detective story, I think. I don't mind a bit of plot in my horror films, but here is an exceptional case where we don't care who the killer, and it doesn't really matter either. And what's with the mistreatment of animals and children? What was the point of the lady cutting off the bat's head and pouring its blood in a boiler? Or the cutting of the crow's leg by Katrina? There are several things about this movie I will never understand (I've watched it about five times). How come so much damn blood comes out of the dead widow's body, for instance? And what was the point of the evil eye business? And why does everyone always say pardon my intrusion (it's said about four times in the film). Why did the Horseman's axe melt in front of the church? Almost everything that happens in this movie is weird. Much of it probably doesn't even make sense. This is one of the most infuriating movies I've ever seen. But the blame isn't on the director, who does the best possible job of bringing the incohesive script to the screen. It is obviously to be placed on the screenwriter and the editor, who seem unable to create and understandable narrative. Still, with all these flaws, there is also much to admire in the film. Johnny Depp is a pleasure to watch, and young Marc Pickering makes an impressive debut as the poor young Masbath. It is also a very imaginative film, with director Tim Burton continuing to show his talent and originality, but next time he should pick a better script. However, I am eager to see his remake of Planet of the Apes, due out this summer!

Monica certainly did, or else she would not be as distraught.

My biggest thing against this movie is the fact that it pretends to be a fairy tale, but is missing something that prevents it from achieving that level, in the music, the direction, the construction of the story itself. Instead, its a dark drama trying to be something that its not. The biggest fault, I believe, is the story reaches out, but lacks the ambition to carry it to greatness. I never got a sense of wonderment, of something grand, only trying, but never succeeding. I wanted to like this film, unfortunatly I couldn't.

Well, there were definitely some very good special effects, and some bland ones as well.. the integration of the bots with realworld flesh was simply amazing to behold, and the underwater segments looked photorealistic..

A talented cast to be sure, especially Jude Law, though his character seems to lack a true place in the story, like they just needed to fill a slot, and once that slot was ended, he was whisked away in a very dull manner, no real purpose in the story other than that.

The movie seemed to me like a B Movie affair with a good cast and special effects, but never succeeds to draw me in fully into the film itself, to let me be apart of the characters, the action, and the story.. and for that, I give it a C-.. Well, atleast it was better than Dungeons & Dragons, but then again, that's not saying much.

Gloriously free from self-referentiality, it is a rarity among films today in that it relies entirely on its ability to captivate the audience with the characters it creates and in telling a good story well.WOTG features the kind of intelligent, motive driven characters- who most importantly are never innately good or inherently evil- that haven't been seen since Tarantino nearly a decade earlier. Benicio Del Toro is once more a revelation, cementing his position as one of the hottest rising actors around, with a performance in which he manages to say everything, very often without saying anything. Even Phillipe is engaging in a role that subverts his typical 'pretty boy' roles. Kudos must go to him attempting to inject some variety and more unconventional work into his career. A note must also be made about the sublime veteran Caan. He simply oozes class and presence, reducing the likes of Taye Diggs and Nicky Katt to mere amateurs.The strength of this film lies in its writing and its criticisms of the conventions of 'buddy-action movies' and crime flicks. This is clear from the very opening of the film in which we see the two protagonists, clearly about to lose a fight, steal the glory of their opponents by attacking the women they are with the tone is set in which those you would normally root for will do things that both appal and intrigue. The plot is filled with these inventive subversions; including one of the greatest car chases I've seen, despite the fact that it occurs at a pace nothing shorter than walking speed.It is my belief that it is because of this sort of intelligence (it is never spelt out for the audience with a series of close-up shots and pointless dialogue what is going on)and the level of patience that is required to actually follow a story for 2-hours, that prevented WOTG from being a hit.I am not one of those sort of people who will write a review that says 'The Greatest Movie I've Ever Seen (Until The Next One Of Course)' and I shan't pretend that the film doesn't have holes in it characters such as the 'Bag man' played by Juliet Lewis' real life father are somewhat underdeveloped and the editing is occasionally erratic. But for those who are looking for a breath of fresh air and who do stick with what is ultimately a remarkable directorial debut from McQuarrie (he's even drawn comparisons with the likes of Peckinpah and Hawks) they will be rewarded. Those who don't can go and watch GONE IN 60 SECONDS.
