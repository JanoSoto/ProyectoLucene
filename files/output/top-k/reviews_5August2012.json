It is strange, it is provocative, and of course there are scenes where people are actually having sex, no not faking, but actually having sex. Von Trier is one of the few people who can bring such images into a film and make it into a strangely enigmatic film.To be precise, Lars Von Trier wrote the film. However, the activities that are in the plot are just a bit too important. The film has two things. One, it is a great experience. This film could have been Paosolini's 'Salo', in which I hate because even though there is perfection all around, the film is simply a bit too hard to enjoy because of the over the top violence. 'Idioterne' however, is actually quite fun to watch. I can see how some of the moments in the film might have been controversial, but it doesn't go to the extent of being disturbing. It isn't too sexual. It is simply a fun film.The other thing is the theme of the film. Beneath all the chaos, there is still a theme. The problem is, I do not understand the film yet. I simply had such a compelling experience that I haven't really thought about the film. It is so hard to think while watching this film. But let's try. The film is about a group of people intentionally being idiots because they think that it is deep to bring out the inner idiot that is inside everyone and pass around. But that's when it came to themselves and people they didn't know. In the end, when they came back to their original life, they realize how silly they're actions were and how embarrassing it was. But for some reason, a lady who just came into the group, spassed around the moody house in which her family lived. Of course, everybody thought she was insane, but she didn't care. She was the only one who could pass, and she was only in the group for 2 weeks.I can simply say that the film is trying to say that everybody does have an idiot inside of them. It's just how you control it. And I can easily see how much conversation and theories can come out of the film.But for me, it's more of an experience film. It usually was with Palme' Dor nominees. The film is quite a lot of fun. It may disgust you, it may alienate you. However, I had so much fun. I will admit, I was quite alienated myself.

The film combines the best of Disney stunning visuals, appealing characters, great music and a timeless story. The first thing you notice about B&B is the gorgeous artwork - the film opens with an eye-popping shot of a forest and remains a visual delight throughout its 90 minute run-time. B&B includes some of the best Disney songs as well, most notably Belle, Something There and the title song. I own the soundtrack and the score is just as good (The West Wing and Transformation being my favorites). I also think Belle and the beast make a great couple. There's chemistry between them and their romance doesn't feel forced, but natural and genuine. I was very pleased with my 1993 LaserDisc so I was quite hesitant to obtain the blu ray, fearing it would ruin my enjoyment from the film (wasn't too familiar with the format just 2 years ago). Gladly, I was wrong and the film looks breathtaking in HD (although I do reduce the saturation, given the colors are a little too garish to my taste).

Yes.That's basically the problem of the whole film, it has so many scenes that doesn't have to do anything with the film, that could've just been edited. Take another example from the scene with the fashionable clothing, the first four clothes are okay, because we see the three main characters modeling, and the actual main character scowling at the man who came to see them because she saw him before, thinking that he's a pimp. We could've easily ended the scene there. But then it went on to show us the rest of the 12 clothes that weren't shown. It goes on for more than 2 minutes and it is quite restless. These are the kind of scenes that fills the film, long, pointless, just scenes that are not interesting, but are nice to look at.But let's take another look and ask this question, is it funny? Yes, it is quite funny. The film is quite modern with its humor. Although there is that feeling of 'Gentlemen Prefer Blondes' from the whole story, but the characters aren't like that and definitely not the humor. This might be one of those films, right next to Wilder's movies, as the films that gave inspiration for modern humor.

Is it long, meaningless and pointless, and just simply looks good? Yes.That's basically the problem of the whole film, it has so many scenes that doesn't have to do anything with the film, that could've just been edited. Take another example from the scene with the fashionable clothing, the first four clothes are okay, because we see the three main characters modeling, and the actual main character scowling at the man who came to see them because she saw him before, thinking that he's a pimp. We could've easily ended the scene there. But then it went on to show us the rest of the 12 clothes that weren't shown. It goes on for more than 2 minutes and it is quite restless. These are the kind of scenes that fills the film, long, pointless, just scenes that are not interesting, but are nice to look at.But let's take another look and ask this question, is it funny? Yes, it is quite funny. The film is quite modern with its humor. Although there is that feeling of 'Gentlemen Prefer Blondes' from the whole story, but the characters aren't like that and definitely not the humor. This might be one of those films, right next to Wilder's movies, as the films that gave inspiration for modern humor. Take the scenes with Marilyn humor with the poor eye sights (Probably the first time Monroe actually tried to be funny). Take the scene with the hot dog dream from Loco. Take another scene with the main character Schatze as she keeps saying no to the pimp every time he calls her, and yet she always go out with him, and in the end, falls in love with him. These are quite funny moments, and the film is full of it.The performances are quite strong to, although this film as commercialized with the image of Marilyn Monroe with the beautiful image of her is a tight red dress, the film is quite frankly Lauren Bacall's film, who played the main character Schatze (Who turned out to be the lucky one from the three girls). There is a boldness to her expression, such determination. With Monroe and Grable, who played the other two girls, while nice performances, they only felt like your average pretty blonde character. They didn't have any personality (Except Monroe, who is always an exception). Bacall however, had such presence that brings focus to her character. For the first time, there was a performance that shined far more than Monroe's performance in a film that had Monroe in it, and that performance was done by Lauren Bacall.The film is quite fun to watch and it's entertaining. But it is still annoying in the aspect of it being a bit of a filler at times.

Unfortunately the descriptions aren't really correct to these days standards.But the thing is, is this a film about themes? Is this a film that is trying to give us a correct study? I don't think so. The movie is more about the screwball comedy, the music. And of course, the absolutely brilliant performance done by Jane Russell and Marilyn Monroe. Howard Hawk's directing skills shows in this film too, with fast witty dialogue and some brilliantly directed scenes, such as the 'Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend' musical moment, which might have been one of the greatest musical sequences I have seen in my whole life, and which also had a Minelli styled color effect to it.We must also thank the acting. The funny thing is, Jane Russell was supposed to be the lead of the film, and Monroe just a supporting performance. And yet, Monroe shines through the whole film. There was once a saying, that Monroe can brighten any scene that she is in, and that is quite true. Every time she comes into the scene, there is going to be something about the scene in which you just can't help but to smile. This is her second best performance in her whole career, the best being her performance in 'Some Like it Hot', which is another film that she brightens up even though it's in black and white. The reason her performance is great in this film is that she has made the iconically clichéd character, the dumb blonde. Anna Faris, Paris Hilton, they have all mastered that character, and they have Monroe to thank for. Of course, that doesn't mean Jane Russell did a terrible job, with her snappy delivery, her brilliant dancing, and of course, the scene in the court room where she does a satire of Monroe's character, slow talking, trying to be sexy character.The film has of course, dated a bit, with a theme that doesn't really hold up in this time (With 'Some Like it Hot', the theme was that men and women can never become each other, so love is the only way.

Now listen, there's no question that the majority of people are going to hate this movie but if you enjoy silly comedy that is clearly leftover stuff from the 80s then this here offers quite a bit. The story is pretty simple as Ricky Wade (Corey Feldman) is hired by a camp owner (Jack Nance) who finds his business falling apart due to a rival camp. Wade's main goal is to win a water sports contest but soon the stakes are higher than normal. Again, if you're looking for something smart then look elsewhere. I've always enjoyed watching this film because it's just so childish and so bad in so many ways that I can't help but laugh at it and have a good time. Feldman is clearly the perfect choice for this guy as he can be stuck up and deliver smart lines like no one else. Fans of his will enjoy watching him here and while the performance isn't Oscar-worthy it's at least good enough for this type of film. Nance comes across with a maniac performance that is so goofy and over-the-top that you can't help but love it. The supporting cast fit their roles just fine for what it's worth. The comedy is all very childish with the typical sex and fart jokes but we've also got the fat guy no one likes but of course he's going to prove to be a winner by the end. MEATBALLS 4 is a just a cheap sex comedy but it made me laugh.

It didn't even really bother ripping off one of Carpenter's better movies, which is kind of perplexing. Still, it was watchable, despite the director's best attempts to drive me off.The Forsaken stars two TV actors alternately chasing after and being chased by a vampire. The vampire is actually one of the forsaken, a group of blah blah blah, who cares. Yes, there a bit of back story that sets straight all the incorrect vampire myths, tells us their weakness (sunlight), and the rules (must be killed on holy ground). Strangely, if they must be killed on holy ground, I don't understand why they care about sunlight. If sunlight can kill them (they hide during the day), then why do they need to be killed on holy ground? Do they die in sunlight, then instantly come back? Who knows. It's a bizarre plot hole that the director never sought to explain.Like Near Dark, which it also rips off, the vampires are updated to modern times. They use guns to kill people, hide in cars during the daylight hours, etc. It was fresh when Kathryn Bigelow did it, back in the mid 1980s. 15 years later, it's not so fresh.The soundtrack was detestable (full of Nu Metal), but, luckily, most of the music only played for a few seconds, before it faded out. I had blocked out memories of that era, and I resent being forced to experience it again. Without the music, this movie might have gotten a 6\/10, but I kind of doubt it.Should you watch this? Sure, I guess. If you're obsessed with vampires, want to watch eye candy prance around, and you miss early 2000s Nu Metal. Otherwise, I'd say... skip it. It's not exactly bad, but there's nothing to recommend. Just stick to Near Dark, Blade, Vampires, or even Anne Rice's melodramatic soap opera, Interview With The Vampire.

It seems this drama gets pushed behind other baseball movies from this era. I love films like BULL DURHAM and MAJOR LEAGUE and while both of them are tremendously entertaining, in my estimation it's EIGHT MEN OUT that's the better movie. There's no doubt that it helps if you know about the real case but the perfection in this movie is so clear that it's impossible not to get caught up in the drama and tragedy of the events. I think Sayles did a remarkable job capturing the mood and spirit of the country during this era. The visual style of the film is something that really captures this but you've also got to give the set designers and costume designers a lot of credit. The look of the film really makes you feel as if you're back in 1919 and this really helps sell the story. I thought the screenplay was a major benefit as well because it seems that Sayles was interested in telling the story and not really playing favorites. The players are all shown as being guilty but it also shows them as being human in why they took the money. The film shows what a scam the trial was but it also shows that the children who looked up to these players were the real losers. It also doesn't hurt that you've got a tremendous cast bringing these characters to life. John Cusack, John Mahoney, Charlie Sheen, David Strathairn, Christopher Lloyd, D.B. Sweeney, Michael Rooker, Michael Lerner, Studs Terkel and Clifton James are all terrific and certainly deserve much credit. I've heard people complain that certain bits of the story were left out but obviously they couldn't put everything in a two hour movie. I've also heard negative reviews stating that the importance of Joe Jackson should have been given more of a spotlight but I thought the film made a wise choice in letting all stand as equals since they all went into this as one. EIGHT MEN OUT really is one of the best and smartest baseball movies out there.

Jessie, a confused disoriented heiress, is the romantic obsession of two men and the crux of the film's action. However, Rachel Ward fails to convince that Jessie could obsess anyone with her flat delivery and phoned-in performance. Jessie runs off to Mexico to snorkel and shop, and her gangster boyfriend hires an injured football player to find her. Sending a handsome hunky athlete off to find your girlfriend at the beach is not an inspired idea, and both the expected and the unexpected ensue. The twisted convoluted tale occasionally meanders, and the pacing falters at times. However, when the sweaty romantic scenes are over, the plot manages to re-energize and re-capture attention towards the fade out.Despite her physical beauty, Ward is the black hole at the film's center. However, her two co-stars are more captivating. James Woods can play slimy gangsters in his sleep, and his Jake Wise is appropriately chilling and creepy, which makes Jessie's attraction to him even less convincing. Evidently Jake had a brain fart when he decided to hire Terry Brogan to search for the girl who deserted him, because Jake and Terry are worlds apart in the looks and charm departments. Jeff Bridges's athletic Terry, who has history with Jake, is unwittingly drawn into a vortex of corruption during his search for Jessie. Although always watchable, Jeff Bridges has had better and more demanding roles than an injured jock playing private eye. Despite a decent script adapted by Eric Hughes from Daniel Mainwaring's original, the film's central mystery is why Jake and Terry would be hopelessly drawn to a shallow drifter like Jessie. Ward received top billing over Bridges and Woods, another mystery as baffling as any in the plot.Experienced veterans provide solid supporting performances, led by a still-handsome Richard Widmark, who, at age 70, remained a commanding presence. In a nod to film buffs, Jane Greer, star of the 1947 version, appears as Ward's cold distant mother. Location work in the Mayan temples of Mexico's Yucatan is travel-log appealing, and the end credits feature an Oscar-nominated title song by Phil Collins. An exciting car race through Los Angeles traffic is thrilling, if pointlessly reckless. Although Against All Odds runs more than 20 minutes longer than the 1947 original, Bridges and especially Woods are compelling enough to hold attention even when the tricky plot wanders.
