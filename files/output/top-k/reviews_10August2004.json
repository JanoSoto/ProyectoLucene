There is hardly any gore this time around, but that doesn't matter, because Scream 3 is more of a mystery\/suspense, than an all-out slasher like the first two films. Unfortunately, it's not as popular with fans as the first two, but I think it succeeds because it takes risks and dares to be a bit different than the other movies. Plus, Parker Posey is absolutely hilarious and there's even a role that makes Scott Foley seem a bit cooler.

The humor in the first one was at times crude, but mostly civil(nothing you felt really crossed the line, in my opinion). In this one, it's flat-out disgusting; it's very, very crude, mostly has to do with bodily fluids, and there's too many sex jokes for my tastes(and bad ones at that). The film really has very little to offer for anybody but the biggest of Carrey fans(I am a big fan of him myself, and I found this film hard to sit through). Another problem is that it borrows too much material from the first; every good joke is copied directly from the first(several lines are exactly the same), and the movie tries too hard to make you laugh at things that aren't actually funny. I also found the disrespect and mocking towards the tribes fairly insulting; while they may not be civilized, these people are hardly lesser humans, as this film makes them out to be. Another thing I despised was the way they changed Carrey's character to the worse; in the first, he was eccentric, mildly annoying, but mostly funny, and somewhat smart, actually. In this one, he's just annoying, arrogant, childish and, well, completely pathetic. We're supposed to laugh at this character, but how can we possibly laugh when he's so utterly annoying? He was somewhat immature in the first, but here, he's like a spoiled brat. It really seemed like the director didn't get the point of the first film at all; Ace Ventura isn't funny because he's a pathetic loser; he's funny because he's eccentric yet smart, and he somehow manages to be appealing, though he is like a grown child. It's like Oedekerk just took all of the lesser points of the first film, magnified them, put in some of the good, and released it. The plot is less interesting than the first, the mystery is less involving, as both are obviously pushed into the background to allow for the humor instead. I also thought that the humor seemed far too forced and overdone; not one single joke was minor or a detail. No, you have to show something completely ridiculous, and hope the audience finds it funny. One thing that I also have to mention is the special effects; they are truly horrible. I know that it shouldn't matter in a comedy, but come on, every single effect looked so fake. And who's decision was it to make that damn little ape appear in every other scene? It's not like it had a major part in the first movie, after all. It had as little a role in the first as any of the other animals. If they were going to bring back characters from the first, why not bring back some of the ones that work well with Carrey and his character; like Emilio, or Woodstock, or even Melissa. They were actually entertaining, unlike the supporting cast of this film. All in all, a very average film, and not really worthy as a sequel to the much better first film. I recommend this only to the biggest of Carrey fans, and possibly fans of Steve Oedekerk too. 5\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"10 August 2004","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":"  Steve Oedekerk might be a talented film-maker(when I say might, I mean exactly that; I've seen no other movies by him, I plan on doing so soon, though), but he's no Tom Shadyac, and this film very much shows that.

The plot? The son of Seth Brundle (Harley Cross) is born in a corporate laboratory. He grows up at a very fast rate (now played by Eric Stoltz) and falls in love while discovering the evil secrets of the bigwig and his scientists, who have raised him. Nothing helps him on his quest to destroy them more than when the metamorphosis that took place in Dad begins to take place even faster in Son. It has its funny moments (the under-used John Getz from the original gets some big, cynical laughs), as well as very emotionally moving moments (especially when Stoltz puts the mutant dog to sleep, which is very sad and touching). There is a hackneyed element, to be sure (the romantic part with the awful country song is something that would be perfectly acceptable to fast-forward through), but, overall, it's still a kinda fun movie that's more effective than many people might tell you. As far as the gore quotient goes, this one I would consider more of a splatter movie than Cronenberg's (which had its gross-out moments throughout, but wasn't as bloody as this one was). Still, if you like gore, I would suggest it especially. I myself have no problems with gore as long as I like the movie around it, and I liked The Fly 2 enough to actually watch it more than once without that choice being under the influence of substances! Also, one way it was better than the first film was how it ended. While the ending to the first was somewhat abrupt (even if it was a great movie and didn't really need anything extra), this one features a happy ending that is not sappy (always commendable), as well as one of the greatest acts of vengeance ever agonizingly drawn out on film. All in all, I agree that The Fly 2 doesn't really touch David Cronenberg's The Fly in overall quality, but it doesn't deserve the terrible reputation that's been heaped on it over the years, even if there's nothing to disguise the fact that is inferior.

Rocky hesitates, then reconsiders, clenches his fist and knocks the guy out. `Sue me for what?' he says, and walks away rather happily with his wife (Talia Shire) and son (Sage Stallone) treating him like a god.Well, how about assault? Yep, Rocky's brain ain't A-okay in `Rocky V' &#150; his beating in the ring at the end of `Rocky IV' has gone to his head (literally) and now he can't fight again or he'll risk being the next Muhammad Ali. (Not that Rocky necessarily had any brains to begin with.)Most people complain that the `Rocky' sequels are repetitive. They forget `Rocky V' This one, rumored to be the final installment (but Sly wants to do yet another!), is totally different from all the rest. (Which is surprising, since John G. Avildsen &#150; director of `Rocky' &#150; returned only for this one.) I give kudos to Sly for going somewhere new with this film.Example? Unlike the predecessors, `Rocky V' takes its character out of training, throws away his fortunes, implies permanent brain damage, and basically tells us that this movie isn't going to be about boxing. Instead, it'll be about Rocky trying to adjust back to the gritty side of life. (Which isn't the perfect closing to a series that is all about a nobody becoming somebody. It's the essence of the series.)Even the final fight in `Rocky V' is wholly different from the others &#150; it takes place outside, `on the streets,' where Rocky has an unrestricted fight with a guy two times his size. (Guess who wins.)Unfortunately, the slight originality of `Rocky V' doesn't win it any points &#150; it is a poor movie by all standards, featuring Sylvester Stallone's worst performance as the titular character. At first it was realistic, then it sort of became comedic; by `Rocky V,' it was downright ridiculous.The dialogue is stiff and wooden. The acting is worse. And the direction is messy -- more kudos to Sly for managing to write and direct all of the `Rocky' sequels (save `V') and maintain the focus of the first. Avildsen's return behind the camera harms the movie. Why? On the Special Edition DVD of `Rocky,' Avildsen explains that he told the cinematographer to mimic the style of the first film. `But that looked like a documentary!' he was told.And so `Rocky V' looks less like a gritty, realistic documentary and more like an MTV video presentation &#150; during the final fight, the handheld pushes in on the faces of anxious spectators, causing instant nausea. Back-and-forth it goes, again and again, rapidly moving to the beat of some &#145;90s rock\/rap song.The film chronicles Rocky's fall &#150; Paulie (Burt Young) blows the family's fortunes, a new fighter becomes the Heavyweight Champion, and Rocky is left with the grim reality of&#133;nothing.He takes a job at Mickey's (Burgess Meredith, who makes a flashback cameo) old gym as a trainer, which is where he coaches a new boxer, and ultimately finds a new villain to fight. The movie goes nowhere else &#150; it isn't the bold character study that `Rocky' was, nor does it contain the uplifting, victorious underdog message.If nothing else, this proves that Rocky &#150; the character and the films &#150; doesn't translate well onto the screen nowadays. With firmer grasp of direction, perhaps it would &#150; which is why, to be totally honest, I'm not so disappointed to hear that another `Rocky' could be coming along soon. I'm sure it will be a more fitting conclusion to the series than this.2\/5 ","genre":null},{"date":"10 August 2004","score":"2 out of 9 people found the following review useful","review":"  `Touch me and I'll sue,' says a boxing promoter to Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) towards the end of `Rocky V.'

Set in Copenhagen, Denmark, it is the story of the mysterious death of a young Inuit boy who falls from the roof of his apartment building in Denmark. His closest friend and neighbor, who has a keen sense of snow since her days growing up with her mpther among the native tribes in Greenland, is sure that the boy did not simply fall from playing on the roof. (Note In watching this movie, I have to agree with one viewer who wrote that Smilla's Sense of Snow is never really demonstrated. She does make a comment about how the tracks of people who are used to running in snow--like the Inuits--are different from those who only walk in it on occassion, evident from the type of tracks that are made. But most of her conclusions that lead her to believe that this boy's death was no accident are mostly based on forensic science.)Her suspicions lead to quite a dangerous game of cat and mouse, which force her to risk her own life to investigate what exactly happened, which involves a top class arctic scientist working with a company that the young boy's father was working for when he was killed. And the motives are wholly unique, and quite riveting. However, this thriller aspect only seems to really grip us more towards the second half of the film. The first half plays out more like a weary drama as we learn about Smilla's background and her relationship with others in the story. When her mother died, she was transplanted into the unfamiliar modern (and considerably less snowy) surroundings under her father's care in Denmark. She never felt quite right, nor quite at home, and seemed to develop quite a bitter outlook on everything as a result of it. Needless to say, arctic science became her interest (note the part about mathematics being used to measure abstract feelings like beliefs which Smilla explains to her friend, The Mechanic was pretty interesting). But this first half of the movie is mostly the picture of a woman in mourning. We see flashbacks of her time spent with the young boy, eventually becoming more of a protectorate of him than his own mother. As Smilla tells The Mechanic (Gabriel Byrne in typical ambiguity), she is heartbroken. We can understand why she would risk her life just to find some answers about what happened to him. That is where the suspense begins as Smilla is willing to delve deeper and deeper into investigations that involve a top class arctic scientist who performed the autopsy as well as the owner of the company that the young boy's father worked for in Greenland when he was killed. There are not too many people that Smilla will trust to help her out, since the Danish police detectives had made it clear that they don't want her intruding on their investigation, and they willingly make it quite difficult for her to follow her leads too closely and openly. The Mechanic, Smilla's friend, neighbor, and eventually, lover, is a sneaky fellow who always seems to arrive at some unusual location that Smilla has wondered off to in the course of her own investigating. This second half of the movie provides some great action sequences and some unusual suspense and characters. I think because Smilla is such an awkward, misunderstood character, we're never sure if she is able, much less willing, to take her grievance all the way to the top, and face those powerful people who know the truth behind the young boy's death. The movie is great material for a video game, reminiscent of popular Playstation role-playing mystery games like Metal Gear Solid. Smilla seems to travel around like a professional spy, and is very careful (though sometimes not careful enough) in this tricky game she plays with those who will stop at nothing to make sure all loose ends are eliminated, those who can expose more than just the death of a young boy, but something much more devastating. Aside from a unique thriller plot, sometimes the dialogue as well as some of the unusual places Smilla winds up (from the bowels of a large cargo ship to the glaciers of Greenland) seem quite good for a video game setting. It is a decent thriller worth trying. I did, however, find Gabriel Byrne's character rather confusing, thanks to lack of dialogue and emotion (and the fact that Smille and his character act like uncomfortable robots around one another). I know, his character is purposely unrevealing of certain things, as is it a necessary plot point, but I don't think his character was developed much either way. When you finally discover his true nature, it just doesn't seem very gripping. It actually comes off as nonchalant.Tom Wilkinson is Professor Loyen, the doctor who performs the autopsy and is working with the company that the Inuit boy's father worked for. However, he's hardly much of a nemesis because he barely talks much and for the most part, hardly appears in the film. The two main characters of this movie is essentially Julie Ormond as Smilla and Richard Harris as Tork, the owner of the company. Smilla is the strange, detached heroine while Harris is the greedy, but optomistic villain.It is worth a try, even just to see a suspense movie that has nothing to do with the mafia, crooked cops (there are cops here, but they're not central figures), or serial killers, as are the tired plot points of so many thrillers out there today. I like this movie best just because it was something different (different settings--I've rarely seen anything based in Denmark or Greenland; different characters--not the impulsive, arrogant or wimpy, insecure female heroine; and different story).

Really, nothing before or since can really match up to the excitement, intrigue and verve of this film.  All elements; the acting, the direction, the script, it's all perfect.  The film itself is near perfect.The plot starts with Bennet Marco (Frank Sinatra) and a group of soldiers - including Raymond Shaw (Laurence Harvey) - in the middle of a trek through Korea when their guide Chunjin (Henry Silva) betrays them and they are captured.  Flash forward a few years and we have Shaw accepting the medal of honor for valiantly rescuing the rest of the group from their pickle (all but two casualties).  Marco recommended it, but he secretly believes that not all is as it seems, and he doesn't quite trust Raymond Shaw.  I wont go any further, all I'll say is that it involves communism and Shaw's extremely right-wing mother Eleanor (Angela Lansbury) and her vice presidential candidate husband (James Gregory).The way director John Frankenheimer and screen writer John Axelrod create intrigue and suspense is delicious.  A very strange dream sequence that Marco has, the surprise reappearance of Chunjin, the strange fixation on the game solitaire.  We're practically drawn to the screen as more and more is revealed.The acting is terrific.  Frank Sinatra has a sort of style that makes him more likable and less freakily neurotic than your usual run of the mill conspiracy theorist.  Harvey's performance - basically a leading role - is one of the best in the movie, if not the best.  He is a pessimistic, cynical man who loathes himself almost as much as he loathes his domineering mother.  His performance reaches a peak when he tells Sinatra about a time when he was once `lovable', a summer when he fell in love with the daughter of a rival senator to his mother.  His mother, predictably, ended the relationship, causing Harvey to give up on himself.  But he's not completely hopeless, and he tries to do the right thing and stand up to his mother at one point, a goal ending tragically.If Harvey's performance isn't the best than Lansbury's definitely is.  She is a horrifying mother, probably the scariest mother in movie history.  Her manipulations and mind games on her poor son (and others) are the harshest I've ever seen in a movie.  She has absolutely no empathy for her son, he is just a tool for her to use in her schemes and agendas.  When she expresses sorrow and guilt in a late scene we begin to sympathize with her, but she tears it all down with a disturbing new development that completes the whole story arch with Harvey and Lansbury at this point we understand completely all the reasons he     s his mother.It has some delightfully cool touches too.  The solitaire aspect is awesomely delivered.  We even have a fast, energetic martial arts match between Marco and Chunjin.  It's things like this that make the movie both intriguing and fun.By the ending there has been a resolution, but we think that maybe, just maybe, there is still an evil lurking under the surface.  It is never verified, but I'd like to think that there is something still afoot, and not much has been resolved.

That's par for the course for a blockbuster, and not a problem in itself.  The Mogwai's mechanical movement can't help but make it look fake, but we can overlook that too.

The movie got a PG rating, but the Gremlins display the kind of behavior you wouldn't want kids to associate with, especially in the rowdy bar scene, during which Phobe Cates is behind the bar, inexplicably serving them drinks when most people would have high-tailed it out of there as soon as the little devils showed up.The film also struggles to maintain a consistent tone.  Yes, it's a comedy foremost, but with some horror thrown in.  The comedy doesn't entirely work, even and especially in the scenes where the monsters run amok, and the film's lack of real tension undermines any attempt at a darker quality.

I'm not so sure. 'Rocky' came along at just the right time &#150; it was an uplifting story and people needed that back then. Now, 'Taxi Driver' is usually considered the superior of the two &#150; but they're entirely different and, in my opinion (and it's a rare one), 'Rocky' is just as good &#150; but in a different way. They're both great films, and I'm not saying that 'Taxi Driver' shouldn't have won &#150; but I'm not necessarily saying it should have, either. 'Rocky's' achievement is monumental and it is one of the greatest films ever made. To say it's 'not as good' merely because it is more optimistic is nonsense.So what's so great about 'Rocky II' and why is it generally underrated? (Its average user score right now on the Internet Movie Database -- with over 8,000 votes -- is a measly 6.2\/10, compared to the original's 7.7)Because it maintains the focus of the first film, and continues the story rather well. A story that didn't really need to be continued, per se, but nevertheless formed the foundation of one of the greatest film franchises of all time. That's right &#150; many people hate the 'Rocky' sequels, but apart from 'Part V,' they're all surprisingly entertaining &#150; and, more importantly, well made. I like them; they entertain me, and I think they all serve their purpose.What's particularly interesting about 'Rocky II' is that apart from repeating the central theme of fighting Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers), Rocky (Stallone) goes through a character arc here that many sequels totally ignore &#150; we see the after-effects of his fight, and him struggling to adapt to the 'New Life.' Rocky is not a smart person. But he is one of cinema's deepest characters. Stallone (who wrote all the scripts and directed three of the sequels) succeeds at evolving Rocky's self-confidence. After winning a small fortune from his famous fight with Creed, he goes out on an impulsive shopping spree, buying a cool car, a new leather jacket (with a tiger &#150; the beast with the 'eye' that Rocky re-captures in 'Part III' &#150; printed on the back), and a new luxurious apartment for him and his wife Adrienne (Talia Shire).The problem is that Rocky soon runs out of money. His happy-go-lucky personality crashes when he is faced with the prospect of losing it all. He promised Adrienne never to fight again, and keeps his word by trying to get a 'real' job at the meat-processing factory (the same one he trained at in the original film). However due to staff cut backs he is fired and soon realizes that he was born for one reason To fight. Meanwhile, Apollo is eager to take on 'The Italian Stallion' again &#150; to prove he isn't the coward that criticizers are implying he is. He entices Rocky back into the ring for a final match &#150; and to say that the outcome is satisfactory is an understatement.Most people seem to forget that Stallone is almost solely responsible for the entire success of 'Rocky' as a whole. He came up with the idea, wrote a script, fought to get it made, fought to become the leading star, and literally fought to get in shape. All of this fighting paid off &#150; and it continued to pay off as he kept on cranking out all the sequels.Indeed, the 'Rocky' legacy is often poked fun at because it is the typical endless Hollywood moneymaking franchise. But 'Rocky II' and 'III' (more so than the other two sequels) have guts, power, determination and focus &#150; they've got the so-called 'Eye of the Tiger' and I can't really say that I agree with anyone who says these movies are worthless. They aren't masterpieces but they certainly aren't trash, either. I give 'Rocky II' a hearty recommendation &#150; it's a truly solid sequel that surprises us right when we expect to be disappointed.

After winning a small fortune from his famous fight with Creed, he goes out on an impulsive shopping spree, buying a cool car, a new leather jacket (with a tiger &#150; the beast with the 'eye' that Rocky re-captures in 'Part III' &#150; printed on the back), and a new luxurious apartment for him and his wife Adrienne (Talia Shire).The problem is that Rocky soon runs out of money. His happy-go-lucky personality crashes when he is faced with the prospect of losing it all. He promised Adrienne never to fight again, and keeps his word by trying to get a 'real' job at the meat-processing factory (the same one he trained at in the original film). However due to staff cut backs he is fired and soon realizes that he was born for one reason To fight. Meanwhile, Apollo is eager to take on 'The Italian Stallion' again &#150; to prove he isn't the coward that criticizers are implying he is. He entices Rocky back into the ring for a final match &#150; and to say that the outcome is satisfactory is an understatement.Most people seem to forget that Stallone is almost solely responsible for the entire success of 'Rocky' as a whole. He came up with the idea, wrote a script, fought to get it made, fought to become the leading star, and literally fought to get in shape. All of this fighting paid off &#150; and it continued to pay off as he kept on cranking out all the sequels.Indeed, the 'Rocky' legacy is often poked fun at because it is the typical endless Hollywood moneymaking franchise. But 'Rocky II' and 'III' (more so than the other two sequels) have guts, power, determination and focus &#150; they've got the so-called 'Eye of the Tiger' and I can't really say that I agree with anyone who says these movies are worthless. They aren't masterpieces but they certainly aren't trash, either. I give 'Rocky II' a hearty recommendation &#150; it's a truly solid sequel that surprises us right when we expect to be disappointed.

I'm not so sure. 'Rocky' came along at just the right time &#150; it was an uplifting story and people needed that back then. Now, 'Taxi Driver' is usually considered the superior of the two &#150; but they're entirely different and, in my opinion (and it's a rare one), 'Rocky' is just as good &#150; but in a different way. They're both great films, and I'm not saying that 'Taxi Driver' shouldn't have won &#150; but I'm not necessarily saying it should have, either. 'Rocky's' achievement is monumental and it is one of the greatest films ever made. To say it's 'not as good' merely because it is more optimistic is nonsense.So what's so great about 'Rocky II' and why is it generally underrated? (Its average user score right now on the Internet Movie Database -- with over 8,000 votes -- is a measly 6.2\/10, compared to the original's 7.7)Because it maintains the focus of the first film, and continues the story rather well. A story that didn't really need to be continued, per se, but nevertheless formed the foundation of one of the greatest film franchises of all time. That's right &#150; many people hate the 'Rocky' sequels, but apart from 'Part V,' they're all surprisingly entertaining &#150; and, more importantly, well made. I like them; they entertain me, and I think they all serve their purpose.What's particularly interesting about 'Rocky II' is that apart from repeating the central theme of fighting Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers), Rocky (Stallone) goes through a character arc here that many sequels totally ignore &#150; we see the after-effects of his fight, and him struggling to adapt to the 'New Life.'

If it succeeds in making the illusion interesting, believable, and consistent within its own realm, I find it to be my favorite kind of film to watch. But if it does not succeed, I feel really cheated. Dark City very nearly falls into the latter category.The concept of constantly having one's identity altered and switched is something I've thought about all my life, and it is presented here in a manner that is equal parts confusing, fascinating, and terrifying. And the characters John Murdoch, left painfully more aware of his surroundings by the loss of his memory; The Strangers, seemingly all-powerful, all-knowing, and all mysterious; Dr. Shreber, just as mysterious, almost as knowing, but ultimately powerless; all of them combine (along with the amazing, and often quite chilling visuals) to tell the story almost perfectly.Almost. As I see it, there is one big problem The part of the story that deals with memories is terrific. But the concept of tuning I found to be strained and badly done. For one thing, there's hardly even an attempt to explain why John Murdoch is able to tune (something about higher evolution; but it's glazed over). It's stated, in fact, that it's quite impossible for him to be able to do so, and the fact that he can makes no sense at all. Aside from some cool effects involving the creation and manipulation of buildings, the entire tuning process seems to function as nothing more than a convenient Deus Ex Machina. Whenever Murdoch is in danger, he accidentally is able to tune his way out. And then, at the end, he's suddenly given the ability to control his powers, and modifies the world to make it more suitable, creating a sun and an ocean and such, and everyone lives happily ever after (though how he's able to do all of this himself when it takes the entire group of Strangers just to make a few buildings is beyond me). Among my many problems with this scenario is that the upbeat, happy ever after ending just doesn't seem to fit with the tone of the rest of the film. ALSO This movie is quite often compared with The Matrix. They obviously have a lot in common A group of people are kept oblivious to their own enslavement by powerful and enigmatic villains who have them imprisoned in a world that is not real. A man who senses something is wrong is made aware of the situation by a mysterious teacher, who then helps him use his incredible (but hitherto unknown) powers to put a stop to the evil and free the people. Heck, even some of the sets are the same.First of all, The Matrix did not rip off Dark City. These concepts have been around, in lore and in philosophy, for centuries. Secondly, I believe that The Matrix succeeds where this movie fails, for the simple reason that it takes the religious route, rather than the philosophical one. Now, of course, there are strong philosophical elements in The Matrix's religious issues, and strong religious elements in Dark City's philosophical issues. But the key difference is this Dark City's primary concern seems to be with the mind, whereas The Matrix's primary concern seems to be with the soul.For Murdoch to use his powers, he has to concentrate. For Neo to use his powers, he has to believe. The concern of the Dark City inhabitants is their distorted, mixed-and-matched memories, which blur their lives. The Matrix inhabitants have perfectly good lives. But it's not enough. They want to be free. True, it is, technically, their minds that are enslaved, but I believe the undertone is clearly that of saving one's soul. In taking on the form of a religious allegory, the sudden happy ending of The Matrix (only talking about the original, of course) is not unexpected or out of tune with the rest of the movie, but rather marks the fulfillment of prophesy and the ushering in of a promised new life. And Neo's sudden realization of the full extent of his own power is not a matter of knowledge, but a matter of faith. For me, at least, this makes it a lot more believable and acceptable.

If it succeeds in making the illusion interesting, believable, and consistent within its own realm, I find it to be my favorite kind of film to watch. But if it does not succeed, I feel really cheated. Dark City very nearly falls into the latter category.The concept of constantly having one's identity altered and switched is something I've thought about all my life, and it is presented here in a manner that is equal parts confusing, fascinating, and terrifying. And the characters John Murdoch, left painfully more aware of his surroundings by the loss of his memory; The Strangers, seemingly all-powerful, all-knowing, and all mysterious; Dr. Shreber, just as mysterious, almost as knowing, but ultimately powerless; all of them combine (along with the amazing, and often quite chilling visuals) to tell the story almost perfectly.Almost. As I see it, there is one big problem The part of the story that deals with memories is terrific. But the concept of tuning I found to be strained and badly done. For one thing, there's hardly even an attempt to explain why John Murdoch is able to tune (something about higher evolution; but it's glazed over). It's stated, in fact, that it's quite impossible for him to be able to do so, and the fact that he can makes no sense at all. Aside from some cool effects involving the creation and manipulation of buildings, the entire tuning process seems to function as nothing more than a convenient Deus Ex Machina. Whenever Murdoch is in danger, he accidentally is able to tune his way out. And then, at the end, he's suddenly given the ability to control his powers, and modifies the world to make it more suitable, creating a sun and an ocean and such, and everyone lives happily ever after (though how he's able to do all of this himself when it takes the entire group of Strangers just to make a few buildings is beyond me). Among my many problems with this scenario is that the upbeat, happy ever after ending just doesn't seem to fit with the tone of the rest of the film. ALSO This movie is quite often compared with The Matrix. They obviously have a lot in common A group of people are kept oblivious to their own enslavement by powerful and enigmatic villains who have them imprisoned in a world that is not real. A man who senses something is wrong is made aware of the situation by a mysterious teacher, who then helps him use his incredible (but hitherto unknown) powers to put a stop to the evil and free the people. Heck, even some of the sets are the same.First of all, The Matrix did not rip off Dark City. These concepts have been around, in lore and in philosophy, for centuries. Secondly, I believe that The Matrix succeeds where this movie fails, for the simple reason that it takes the religious route, rather than the philosophical one. Now, of course, there are strong philosophical elements in The Matrix's religious issues, and strong religious elements in Dark City's philosophical issues. But the key difference is this Dark City's primary concern seems to be with the mind, whereas The Matrix's primary concern seems to be with the soul.For Murdoch to use his powers, he has to concentrate. For Neo to use his powers, he has to believe. The concern of the Dark City inhabitants is their distorted, mixed-and-matched memories, which blur their lives. The Matrix inhabitants have perfectly good lives. But it's not enough. They want to be free. True, it is, technically, their minds that are enslaved, but I believe the undertone is clearly that of saving one's soul. In taking on the form of a religious allegory, the sudden happy ending of The Matrix (only talking about the original, of course) is not unexpected or out of tune with the rest of the movie, but rather marks the fulfillment of prophesy and the ushering in of a promised new life. And Neo's sudden realization of the full extent of his own power is not a matter of knowledge, but a matter of faith. For me, at least, this makes it a lot more believable and acceptable. Still, all-in-all, Dark City was quite a good movie, and I very much enjoyed it. ","genre":"Action, Drama, Fantasy"}]
