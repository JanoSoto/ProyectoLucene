I had borrowed the DVD from the local library and had very low expectations for it and knew little of the film's plot other than what the DVD box had offered. I was still wide-awake so I popped the DVD into the player just to get some entertainment. Scent of a Woman would then become one of my personal favorites. For the next 2hrs and 37min I will be pleasantly surprised by this dramatic but also lightly comedic film that I felt sad when it ended.Al Pacino, who is one of the prolific actors of his time breaks out of his usual gangster persona to play Lt. Col. Frank Slade, a blind man who meets his complete opposite and most unlikely friend. Prep school student Charlie Simms (a pre-Robin Chris O'Donnell), desperate for a job during the Thanksgiving weekends so he can earn enough money to spend Christmas back at his home in Oregon, is hired to babysit Frank while the family goes on a trip that Frank refused to go along with. Little did Charlie know, Frank already has already purchased tickets to New York where he will eventually enjoy himself with expensive restaurants, big hotels, and a beautiful woman. At the end of his trip, he plans to commit suicide because he simply cannot tolerate his blindness anymore.There is a subplot involving Charlie's fiasco at his prep school. After witnessing a prank on the school headmaster's beloved car, Charlie is asked to spill the names of the members behind the prank in order to be bribed for a chance to enter Harvard University, or find himself in great trouble. The other student who also witnessed the prank is a rich-snob-type, George (a pre-Capote Philip Seymour Hoffman), who may have been behind the prank as well. We can think Charlie is ridiculously naive, but Frank takes note of Charlie's integrity and admires him for it, and for some reason, we should too. The subplot is a bit silly if you really think about it, but then again, without this subplot, one of the best speeches I have ever seen in film will never exist -- and that is the speech that earned Pacino his first Oscar, twenty years and seven nominations later.What is so great about Pacino's performance is not just because he plays a blind man, but he makes a very unlikable character into an object of sympathy. We hate him because we can't stand him, but we like him because he respects Charlie's integrity like no one else does. In a way, Pacino IS the film because without his performance, this film wouldn't have the same greatness. And even the Hoo-ah! would sound different if it was performed by another actor -- and we won't want that to happen! Another strong point is that Pacino never makes O'Donnell into his walking shadow and this gives a chance for his co-star to shine as well. Maybe O'Donnell didn't deliver a performance as heartbreaking and wonderful as Pacino, but the two actors were able to produce perfect chemistry and their absurd friendship seemed truly believable.There is a scene in this movie where Frank visits his family. We watch as everyone in the house looks at him with their unwelcoming eyes. Frank can sense it, but he tries to make the best of it since he still has his planned suicide in mind. He tries to have a Thanksgiving meal with his family, only to fall into an argument with his nephew (Bradley Whitford). That was the moment that I really sympathized Frank because it felt like he was someone who had finally come to terms with his blindness but regrets his past, but he isn't ready to be nice about it.Even with its long runtime, the film manages to be very entertaining as the audience watches Frank dancing the tango with a young woman (Gabrielle Anwar, in one of the film's most memorable moments) to Frank driving the Ferrari at full-speed. Even in the most dramatic moments, I didn't find one boring second to this film. As Frank shouts to Charlie, I'm in the dark, here! I felt a strong chill going through me as if I finally understood Frank.After seeing this film, you would be surprised that this film was directed by Martin Brest, the same guy who gave us -- you guessed it -- Gigli. He does such a superb job in this film even when the script (written by Bo Goldman, who adapted the 1974 Italian film, Profumo di donna) is attached with the standard Hollywood formula. What lead the audience overlook the formula was the marvelous character-driven plot and the lively, humorous, and quotable dialogue. The film is about friendship between two very different people who were able to help each other in their time of need. Scent of a Woman also contains one of the best feel-good endings ever (maybe because it actually felt good) as both men discovers a new purpose to life and a new will to live.

I hope so because viewing it for the first time since its original release, I think it's probably still his most mature and romantic film. Neither as hilariously quirky as Annie Hall nor as expansive in perspective as Hannah and Her Sisters, this film focuses almost exclusively on the degrees of human fallibility in its central characters, almost all of whom are writers and consequently acute, sometimes pretentious observers of the life around them.Allen portrays Isaac Davis, a neurotic but successful TV writer who at 42, has soured on love after two failed marriages. Almost in emotional retaliation, he has taken up with Tracy, a seventeen-year old high school student. She is a calming influence but one he refuses to take seriously given her tender years. Isaac's frustrated best friend Yale, married twelve years to Emily, has been having an affair with an irritatingly self-absorbed editor named Mary. Realizing the relationship cannot go anywhere, Mary breaks it off and finds herself drawn to Isaac. Concurrently caught in an unexpected career change, Isaac starts to face realities about his own emotional state, and complications ensue in a most resonant manner. In fact, the last five minutes are the most achingly romantic that Allen has put on film.What remains impressive about this true masterwork is the unbeatable combination of the clever, penetrating script by Allen and Marshall Brickman (reunited from Annie Hall), the grandly orchestrated Gershwin pieces as a musical chorus and the astonishing black-and-white cinematography of Gordon Willis. As usual for an Allen film, the performances are uniformly accomplished. In something of an about-face from the lovable Annie, Diane Keaton unapologetically brings out the sharp intellect and brittle neurosis of Mary in crisp detail. Michael Murphy plays a variation of his cheating husband in An Unmarried Woman but with far greater depth as Yale. In her breakout year, Meryl Streep, looking austerely beautiful with her long blonde hair cast to one side, has three incisive scenes as Isaac's ex-wife Jill, who has since embarked on a lesbian relationship and writes a tell-all book about their marriage.Ironically, Anne Byrne was just about to go through her own public divorce from Dustin Hoffman when she played Emily at the time. Even Allen manages a few moments of poignancy that transcend Isaac's constant angst. But the jewel of the cast is Mariel Hemingway, who plays Tracy with such a beguiling blend of maturity and naiveté. As it turns out, her character is the only one who is emotionally available and honest about her feelings. This is still a splendid work, and if you can get past the life-imitating-art-imitating-life analogies, this one will stay with you. And Manhattan never looked better. With a sharp print transfer, the 2000 DVD unsurprisingly has no extras, as with all Allen films, except the original theatrical trailer.

The film also includes, to confuse the plot even more, a 1960's serial killers who by the past being changed ends up murdering the mother and wife of the father and son who changed it. The two who are involved in this inter-dimensional, and 30 year, relationship who exist in two different or parallel universes at the same time.If the movie Fernquency stuck to the time travel angle, like the far better Butterfly Effect, and showed how changing the past, if at all possible, can make things even worse then they already are it would have streamlined it's story. Not only making it far more believable but interesting and easier to follow. But by the film instead putting in a crime angle it just completely short-circuits and flips you out. We have in the movie both father and son Frank & John Sullivan, Dennis Quaid & James Cavlezel, working together in two different time periods, 1969 & 1999. They not only solve the Nightingale serial killings but prevent the murder of Frank & John's wife and mother Julia (Elizabeth Mitchell), who if it wasn't for the two fooling around with the past in the first place, which would have never happened. The manipulating of time also has them causing the murders of an extra seven women in the process!Frequency would have far more entertained, instead of bored and confused, it's audience if it's just put in some kind of logic that would have had people watching it overlook it's ridicules plot. The amazing and mild boggling story also includes and factors in the Amazin Mets. The Amazin's not only pull off one of the biggest upsets in Baseball history, by defeating the overwhelmingly favored Baltimore Orioles in five games in the 1969 World Series, but also have a lot to do with convincing the police to the serial murders. With family friend and precinct captain Stach Deleon ,Andre Braugher, getting information from 1999 thirty years earlier by both Frank & John about the outcome of the series before it actually happens!Were made to believe in the movie that an unusual conjunction of tremendous Sun Spot activity together with the Northern Lights of the Auroral Borealis caused all this weird action to happen. All this supposedly had radio signals not just travel through space but also through time!

At first not believing what he's hearing John is soon convinced that it's really his late dad that he talking to. John takes a while to convince Frank that he's really his , at then time back in 1969, six year old son whom Frank affectionately calls Little Chief.John telling his father what's to happen the next day, Otober 12, 1969, in a fire he'd be fighting as a member of New York's Bravest. Frank does what he's told to do by his grown up and future son John aka Little Chief that ends up saving his life. What it also does is put a whole new set of events into motion that would end up having his wife Julia murdered by a serial killer!. The strange event would also prevent the serial killer from being arrested for another crime that he committed in March 1970 and thus have him free to kill an additional seven women that he, if John hadn't fooled around with the past, would never have murdered.It's now up to both John & Frank, like some time traveling tag-team combination,to change and keep re-changing the past after screwing it up until they finally get it right! The two now attempt to bring their wife\/mother back to life and at the same time prevent the serial killer from the past in 1969 now alive and well in the present from murdering John!

Both father and son finally meet in the flesh as the killer, who was about to do in John, lost the use of his right hand in 1999. This happens by getting it blown off by Frank with a shotgun in 1969.

To criticise Lucas is sacrilege, apparently.Codswallop.You can't base your opinion of a film on how much you liked previous instalments, or how long you've waited for it. Look at the film, for heaven's sake.It's trash.The fact that it has those words 'Star Wars' at the start does not affect the quality of the film. Yet so many people judge it as a Star Wars film, as if that's some universally recognised genre. Judge it instead on what it is. I did.And here are a few wee details I noticed (in no particular order)1) The acting is unbearably lifeless. Yet this is a film with actors of real quality. Either you blame the scriptwriter (Lucas) or the director (Lucas).2) The much-vaunted pod racing scene. It's the Love Bug. You know, old Disney flick with a white VW. Lucas filched the plot, condensed it, and stuck some pretty graphics in. You doubt me? In the Love Bug -Our hero is a put-upon nobody with, apparently, no chance of success. -His rival is smart, popular, amazingly successful, and no-one knows he's a cheat. And his vehicle is top notch. -Our hero's vehicle, however, is implausibly good, far better than everyone imagines. -So said rival sabotages it. -And alters the signs to send our hero the wrong direction. -A vital part of our hero's vehicle falls off. -But he puts it back together, and unfeasibly wins the race. Sound familiar?3) Jar-Jar Binks. Oh, for crying out loud. Even Star Wars devotees find fault here. It's just sickening. (And so blatantly designed to sell Happy Meals).4) The 'slapstick' that Lucas throws in - Binks messing about and accidentally winning a battle etc - could have been written by a five-year-old; it's not in the least bit funny. It really doesn't deserve the same label as that attached to such slapstick geniuses as Keaton, Chaplin and Lloyd. I'd rather call Lucas' efforts 'complete dross'.5) It doesn't make sense. If Darth Vader built C3PO when he was a nipper, surely they'd recognise each other in years to come? Unless, of course, C3PO was just put in to sell Happy Meals...6) On the same note - if two-bladed light sabres are so great, why don't they have them in the future?7) Ewan McGregor's accent.8) The phrase 'Star Wars' suggests exciting adventure in space, battles of good and evil, dashing heroes saving the day, and all that matinée fun that Lucas was aiming at in the first place. It does not, nor should it ever, suggest debates about tax reform. I don't care how important it is to the story; if the only way Lucas could link this with the original was to analyse the galactic budget, he needs a new story. I don't remember the original film having to many fiscal quandaries in its plot.9) Was anyone surprised by anything that happened in the entire 2 1\/4 hours?10) Oh, and the names. What exactly is Lucas on?In short, then 1) Badly acted, written and directed; 2) Plagiarism; 3) Worst character in movie history; 4) Bad jokes; 5) Blatant commercialisation; 6) Hopeless attempt at continuity; 7) Ewan McGregor's accent; 8) Desperately dull; 9) Complete lack of imagination; and 10) Rank stupidity.And I've only scratched the surface.If, by some fluke of glorious fortune, you've yet to see this film, please, please, don't bother.

To criticise Lucas is sacrilege, apparently.Codswallop.You can't base your opinion of a film on how much you liked previous instalments, or how long you've waited for it. Look at the film, for heaven's sake.It's trash.The fact that it has those words 'Star Wars' at the start does not affect the quality of the film. Yet so many people judge it as a Star Wars film, as if that's some universally recognised genre. Judge it instead on what it is. I did.And here are a few wee details I noticed (in no particular order)1) The acting is unbearably lifeless. Yet this is a film with actors of real quality. Either you blame the scriptwriter (Lucas) or the director (Lucas).2) The much-vaunted pod racing scene. It's the Love Bug. You know, old Disney flick with a white VW. Lucas filched the plot, condensed it, and stuck some pretty graphics in. You doubt me? In the Love Bug -Our hero is a put-upon nobody with, apparently, no chance of success. -His rival is smart, popular, amazingly successful, and no-one knows he's a cheat. And his vehicle is top notch. -Our hero's vehicle, however, is implausibly good, far better than everyone imagines. -So said rival sabotages it. -And alters the signs to send our hero the wrong direction. -A vital part of our hero's vehicle falls off. -But he puts it back together, and unfeasibly wins the race. Sound familiar?3) Jar-Jar Binks. Oh, for crying out loud. Even Star Wars devotees find fault here. It's just sickening. (And so blatantly designed to sell Happy Meals).4) The 'slapstick' that Lucas throws in - Binks messing about and accidentally winning a battle etc - could have been written by a five-year-old; it's not in the least bit funny. It really doesn't deserve the same label as that attached to such slapstick geniuses as Keaton, Chaplin and Lloyd. I'd rather call Lucas' efforts 'complete dross'.5) It doesn't make sense.

Yoda is the single most annoying character in the Star Wars trilogy (yes, that does include the awful Jar Jar Binks), and after a weak start on Hoth, the entire movie goes down the toilet when Yoda appears on screen. Yoda looks like a puppet (big surprise -- he IS a puppet), and sounds like every other Frank Oz character; I kept waiting for him to say Whacka Whacka like Fozzie Bear (I love Fozzie, in case you're wondering). The entire sequence on Yoda's home turf, which is crucial to the movie, just plain doesn't work. It doesn't look otherworldly, it just looks like a poorly lit set. (2) Lando. If we place Jar Jar as the 2nd most annoying character, then Lando is clearly a very close #3. Billy Dee Williams may be a decent actor, but you'd certainly never know it from watching this ham-fisted performance.

The most common misconception is that he did not. Today, Bruce is best known for revolutionizing the face of stand-up &#150; paving the way for such future talents as George Carlin and Bill Hicks &#150; but not many people are actually familiar with his comedy, and that's a shame, because there was a lot more to it than just swearing.He was infamously arrested over a dozen or so times for speaking offensively in comedy clubs, and eventually began to represent himself in court. He never gained respect when he was alive, and so he died a frustrated, misunderstood soul who was simply far too ahead of his time.The masses didn't get him. His racial jokes and political satire was misinterpreted and taken at face value. His sermons ridiculing religion drew hate from conservative Americans.But Bruce enjoyed toying with words, and bending the typical perception of what they symbolized &#150; he cherished the impact they had on people. When Bruce said a certain four-letter expletive, it wasn't to purposely offend people &#150; it was to help liberate their ways of thinking. Words were an entryway - once he could knock people off-balance, he was free to go for the throat. He used foul language in the same way as he used words dealing with religion, homosexuals, politics and the world &#150; he used them to make a point. And it's a shame his point didn't resonate until after his death.The makers of Lenny understood Bruce, though. They also understood his flaws as a human being, and the result is an unflinchingly honest biopic that paints a dark, staunch portrait of a troubled man. Dustin Hoffman presents Lenny as an alternately despicable and heroic figure, and there is a spark in his eyes throughout the early scenes of the movie that eventually gives way to desperation later in the picture. Hoffman is so convincing we forget we are watching an actor. He entirely embodies himself within Lenny Bruce, adapting all of the comic's tics and habits.The movie is told from the perspective of those who knew Bruce &#150; his wife, Honey (Valerie Perrine), his aunt, and his manager. The narrative cuts back and forth between scenes with Lenny and interview segments, which we see through the eyes of an off-screen interviewer (whose voice is none other than the movie's director, Bob Fosse).Lenny is an uncomfortable film, and it is not by any means perfect. The matter-of-fact narrative is a bit alienating and prevents us from getting entirely close to Bruce &#150; but that may very well have been the point. A more heartfelt biography of the performer perhaps would have restricted Fosse and screenwriter Julian Barry from divulging into Lenny's more seedy character traits &#150; such as when he coerces his unwilling wife into a threesome with another woman, later ridiculing her for doing so; or when he goes on stage completely drugged out of his mind and makes a fool of himself. If they had allowed audiences to empathize with Bruce to a greater degree, truth may have been sacrificed along the way. And although the narrative is rather cold, it's also unique &#150; sometimes refreshingly so.Despite imperfections, Lenny is one of the better motion pictures of the 1970s &#150; and perhaps one of the movies that best capture the essence of cinema from a time when the mainstream and art-house were coexistent.It is a typical 1970s production insofar as that it is grim, bleak and more depressing than any production you would have seen on the screen a decade earlier &#150; but it's an admirable feat. Fosse has a close grip on the direction and Hoffman and Perrine are both absolutely superb, bringing to life two very tortured souls who temporarily found solace in each other, before finding their relationship put to the test by drug abuse and self-loathing.Lenny died from a heroin overdose in 1966. In 2003 he was granted a posthumous pardon by New York State for his most notable arrest in 1964, for an obscene performance. It's a nice gesture, although one can't help but think it would have only really made a difference 40 years ago.

Fosse has a close grip on the direction and Hoffman and Perrine are both absolutely superb, bringing to life two very tortured souls who temporarily found solace in each other, before finding their relationship put to the test by drug abuse and self-loathing.Lenny died from a heroin overdose in 1966. In 2003 he was granted a posthumous pardon by New York State for his most notable arrest in 1964, for an obscene performance.

The most common misconception is that he did not. Today, Bruce is best known for revolutionizing the face of stand-up &#150; paving the way for such future talents as George Carlin and Bill Hicks &#150; but not many people are actually familiar with his comedy, and that's a shame, because there was a lot more to it than just swearing.He was infamously arrested over a dozen or so times for speaking offensively in comedy clubs, and eventually began to represent himself in court. He never gained respect when he was alive, and so he died a frustrated, misunderstood soul who was simply far too ahead of his time.The masses didn't get him. His racial jokes and political satire was misinterpreted and taken at face value. His sermons ridiculing religion drew hate from conservative Americans.But Bruce enjoyed toying with words, and bending the typical perception of what they symbolized &#150; he cherished the impact they had on people. When Bruce said a certain four-letter expletive, it wasn't to purposely offend people &#150; it was to help liberate their ways of thinking. Words were an entryway - once he could knock people off-balance, he was free to go for the throat. He used foul language in the same way as he used words dealing with religion, homosexuals, politics and the world &#150; he used them to make a point. And it's a shame his point didn't resonate until after his death.The makers of Lenny understood Bruce, though. They also understood his flaws as a human being, and the result is an unflinchingly honest biopic that paints a dark, staunch portrait of a troubled man. Dustin Hoffman presents Lenny as an alternately despicable and heroic figure, and there is a spark in his eyes throughout the early scenes of the movie that eventually gives way to desperation later in the picture. Hoffman is so convincing we forget we are watching an actor. He entirely embodies himself within Lenny Bruce, adapting all of the comic's tics and habits.The movie is told from the perspective of those who knew Bruce &#150; his wife, Honey (Valerie Perrine), his aunt, and his manager.

The stories are very different but have some subtle similarities such as both characters were prone to disaster and both were from works of literature, but the two main characters of the stories have to connection with one and another. The first of these stories is my personal favorite Disney flick of all time and that's Mr. Toad, the most wild and wonderful character in the Disney library. Based of The Wind in the Willows, the movie is about four friends who are very different and go on wild adventures due to the wacky and wonderful toad. The movie focuses on the second half of the book about Mr. toad and did take some poetic license but I think it made the story better. Although the novel is pretty uneven also, coming from someone who has read it, because half the story is much more calm(not boring just more quite.) and focuses more about Mole being new to the riverbank and being introduced to everyone for the first time. Then the second half of the book focuses more on Mr. Toad's escapades, which was much more fast paced and more entertaining than the first half so I can see why they chose the second half if they only had thirty minutes to do it but it would be cool to see it as a feature length film, or would have been. The characters and acting of the voice talents is what made this movie such a great film and the story was also very entertaining and never felt slow or boring. However, if you have a stick up your.......butt, and are so worried about Disney characters having to act like clueless little kids and I guess you have such stupid kids they can't tell right from wrong and your to much of a lazy parent to tell them not to get all cocky and arrogant (The reason for M.r toad's trouble really, him being arrogant and thinking the world revolved around him.) then don't watch it and complain about it constantly. I always loved this film due and Mr. toad does learn his lesson, although it does end with him flying off on a plane rather recklessly but it would of been a bummer if started acting all cute at the end, and I agree with someone who said he's one of the few Disney characters with any balls or has any real adventures. The Ichabod story is a little bit of a downer, I usually turn off my TV once the M.r Toad is over, it fails to really entertain me. I have read the story The Legend of Sleppy Hollow, and I liked it fine and many people think Disney dumbed it down to make it into musical but Tim Burtons version (which I think this version is better.) took much more of a poetic license then this one. Disney didn't really take any poetic licenses, because mostly the Legend of Sleepy Hollow is a love story and the headless horseman comes in at the end and kills Ichabod, This the only Disney movie where the hero, main character dies in the end which is pretty cool how they didn't dumb down the ending. But when Disney was around they didn't do much of that, it was after his death they got into that It has to be family fondly to a point of stupidity. thing. Ichabod is a musical to a point where it gets annoying at times, but the ending is great and not really scary but eerie which was cool. Even though the Ichabod sequence is mostly known for the headless horseman scene, the character, surprisingly like in the originial story, doesn't come in until the last few minutes or pages of the story. Which I found this pretty odd and kind of out of place because it seems as if the writer of Sleepy Hollow just wanted to think of a creative way to kill off Ichabod Crane so he made up the weird character of the headless horseman, it turned out to be pretty cool but if you were stop and think about it you'd have to admit it's kind of outthere for such a light hearted story for the most part. But all in all Ichabod was pretty good, not near as good as toad, but still good. Although, some liberal parents like to complain it's to scary for young children, try being parent and turn off your TV if it scares them, best advice I can give you. The sad part about this film is that most people have never even heard of it, which is a shame because it really is one of their better movies. Although the Disney Company has sucked ever since the 80's because now they value money over quality which they should at least try to do both but I guess you can't? At least most people use to know Mr. Toad as the wild motorist at the best theme park attraction ever (based of one damn good movie.) but the Esiner jerks took down for the fat.......butt bear. Although, the Ichabod story I think surpassed the toad in popularity because I think it's stood the test of time better because people thought the toad characters, as I said earlier, were made up especially for the ride. I think this one of the few Disney movies everyone can enjoy not just little kids. Mty rating six out of ten and three out of five (Not an eight or a four mostly do to Ichabod.)

I think in retrospect that I was expecting too much the same thing I got from Pulp Fiction. Specifically I was disappointed that Sam Jackson and Robert Deniro's characters were such small time criminals and just not badass enough. I thought it was kind of a waste of their talents. Thinking about it now, I realize why would you want to see Deniro and Jackson repeat previous performances? Tarantino did something new with them in this film and they both turned in very interesting performances that are better than the vast majority of their work in film since.Just in general, I really think this is the best Tarantino film I've seen except Reservoir Dogs. Why? Because the characters are more real and the plot\/story is more focused. I love the performances he got out of Pam Grier and Robert Forster. Both of them are fantastic actors who really were wasted through most of the 80s and 90s until Quentin came along and basically rescued him, like he did for Travolta. Except Forster and Grier are way better than Travolta, and turn in excellent and nuanced performances here. The chemistry between them is perfect.A few tangential comments. The music is good, as usual, the first time I saw it I felt it was a bit forced. But I realize now that it was part of the verite effect he was going after. Having the characters interact with the music makes the music seem a bit more obtrusive, but it also makes the film seem more real.There is a lot of good character work in this film too. Keaton is great as a youngish cop, the nice guy in the routine. Fonda shines as a slutty stoner, the type of girl who makes fun of her boyfriend to his friends when he's not there, as if that would make them seem more appealing or sophisticated. In fact there is a very nice kind of dovetailing effect where you really don't notice the difference between the performances of the stars and the character actors. The stars (Forster, Grier, Jackson) get to do basically just an expanded version of character work, and it makes for an even more seamless film than Pulp Fiction which at times feels bogged down by the weight of its stars.All in all, a good story with good actors makes for a good film, if a bit slow in the end when we have to see the heist from multiple viewpoints despite its predictability.

Tarantino did something new with them in this film and they both turned in very interesting performances that are better than the vast majority of their work in film since.Just in general, I really think this is the best Tarantino film I've seen except Reservoir Dogs. Why? Because the characters are more real and the plot\/story is more focused. I love the performances he got out of Pam Grier and Robert Forster. Both of them are fantastic actors who really were wasted through most of the 80s and 90s until Quentin came along and basically rescued him, like he did for Travolta. Except Forster and Grier are way better than Travolta, and turn in excellent and nuanced performances here. The chemistry between them is perfect.A few tangential comments. The music is good, as usual, the first time I saw it I felt it was a bit forced. But I realize now that it was part of the verite effect he was going after. Having the characters interact with the music makes the music seem a bit more obtrusive, but it also makes the film seem more real.There is a lot of good character work in this film too. Keaton is great as a youngish cop, the nice guy in the routine. Fonda shines as a slutty stoner, the type of girl who makes fun of her boyfriend to his friends when he's not there, as if that would make them seem more appealing or sophisticated. In fact there is a very nice kind of dovetailing effect where you really don't notice the difference between the performances of the stars and the character actors. The stars (Forster, Grier, Jackson) get to do basically just an expanded version of character work, and it makes for an even more seamless film than Pulp Fiction which at times feels bogged down by the weight of its stars.All in all, a good story with good actors makes for a good film, if a bit slow in the end when we have to see the heist from multiple viewpoints despite its predictability.

A horror movie with nothing good to come of it are usually my favorite types, when the harm that is caused is more or less from the characters own doings (Another flick that does this expertly is Requiem for a Dream),that the characters refuse to accept what their reality is and only make things worse by doing so. Requiem for a Dream had Drug Addiction over Delusion and here we have Grief over Resurrection.At first George A . Romero was suppose to direct but backed out, which wasn't necessarily a bad thing and MAry Lambert took over. Many seem to dislike Mary Lambert's direction for the story, but I think the fact she directed Siesta(1987) in which a female dare devil had to accept reality before she could go on, was a given that Ms. Lambert had experience at working with the necessity for accepting change as she puts it.The plot is genius from the get go. The Creed Family move into their perfect country home in Ludlow, Maine accept for two flaws,1) the huge Semis that storm by day and night (perhaps hinting at Symbolism that death and destruction are always near by and can strike at any moment) and 2) a Spooky Pet sematary with a secret (resurrection of loved ones, but there's a brutal price to pay). These two flaws make them selves known to the family, and the plot unfolds these secrets until the films brutal climax.The acting is a bit off at times sure, and the pace is a little rushed towards the end, but I was too engaged to let those things really bother me. What the movie was asking and saying outweighed those flaws. Death is something EVERYONE has to relate too, and it's something that probably millions fear, but as the movie states Sometimes DEad is better which is quite obvious, you have to accept whats what, it's something you have to face and accept no matter how cray or sad it may seem, otherwise it will make things worse. Dale Midkiff was the perfect Louis Creed, and Fred Gymne was the best performance in the whole movie, make Jud Crandall one likable character. Denise Crosby did what she had to do quite well, even though she appeared one dimensional at times. Miko Hughes is my favorite child actor.This is Mary Lambert's greatest achievement so far. She gives the film a very spooky absorbing look, stylish but not too over the top (she waited till PS2 but it actually worked to help its offbeat screenplay). I mean, she was responsible for Madonna Music videos. She smartly pays more attention to the story though and handles everything quite well. The use of the semi trucks and some scenes with them were genius. The Suspense was high and she gave the film the mean streak that stayed true to the book.The biggest fault though is by King himself (Go figure). His Screenpaly was quite rushed, as if he feared the audience wouldn't like a layered movie. At times he skips all times for character development in favor of all the spooky happenings. The slow but well made evolution to the resurrection in the book is lacking in the movie. One minute its the funeral and then its up to the burial ground. More grief and sorrow would have upped the stakes. The walk up to the pet sematary was expertly done with the cat's resurrection (all about that freaky noise) but the second time it was so rushed, in the book it was one of the most terrifying things, but in the movie it happens too quickly.The music by Elliot Goldenthal is freaky and sad at the same time and suits the movie perfectly. I especially liked the opening credit theme.The movie is very mean spirited and gory. Very much so. It doesn't apologize for the gruesome sights it shows and maybe why a dimwitted hack named Leonard Maltin gave it a BOMB rating. What a moron. The movie has much to serve in the gore department. Thank you MAry Lambert. We have a dude with a smashed in head and you can see his brains, a frozen dead cat, mutilated rats, a kids chewed off leg in a flashback, a resurrected dog with that was killed by rusty barb wire,a sick and ugly deformed bed ridden sister in flashback, semi running over a kid (though just the thought is enough and we don't see the aftermath), but once a scalpel is brought out it got INTENSE, swipings, eyes gouged out, Achilles tendons cut, mouth slashed, half eaten faces, the grisly works that makes 3 Friday the 13ths gore to shame.Overall a rare horror treat, one that is somewhat of a classic to some, and an awful movie to others (but you can probably imagine why) **** out **** PS. I actually dig the sequel which if in the wrong hands it could have been as bad as people say, but it's Mary Lambert in the directing chair again and she makes it work.

But then the mother is so also. Dustin is so right for this part and you can't imagine anyone else playing it. Just try to image Robert Redford in this part, but he didn't qulify because director Nichols sensed that Redford was too much at ease with girls. Thinking about directors with sense! Nowadays it's the producer with the biggest budget who calls the shots - Jerry what? So is Ann Bancroft who has never been lovelier or more aggressive in an amusing way. I love this movie, every bit of it. It's not only terribly funny, it's also painfully funny. It's surreal.

You cannot leave this movie without listening to the soundtrack by Paul Simon, which happens to be made solely for this movie. It's the perfect soundtrack, each song fitting the scene. As I understand it the soundtrack was made for the movie as an LP, meaning whole, individual songs, not bits and pieces scattered all over the place. It's a great shame they don't make movies like this anymore. What are the studios afraid of? Good stories? Great material? Seeking only the maximum box office impact the first weekend?

A scene where a guy walking upside down is almost to funny as Jason makes short work of him and the scene where Jason decides to crush this poor saps head is probably the funniest moment in all of the Jason films.The downs for the movie are only very few. I am sure that seeing this in 3-d was completely awesome but it seeing without the 3-d effect is kind of sad because most of the movie has things that jump out at the screen and what not.
