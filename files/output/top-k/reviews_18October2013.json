A View to a Kill is a very lame excuse for a Bond film because it doesn't modify to fit Moore's age. It still treats him like a young and macho boy when he should be reading a bedtime story to Tanya Roberts.Well the story is at least interesting this time. We have an 80s version of Goldfinger, where microchip tycoon Max Zorin (played by Christopher Walken of all actors; for me this is good) seeks to destroy California's Silicon Valley and create a monopoly on his chips. Oh did I mention he's a wackjob created in a test tube by a Nazi scientist and trained by the KGB. This guy is completely gone, but he's so damn interesting we have to believe this can happen.In an interesting change of scenery (I am biased because I live in the latter) the major scenes and climax happen in and around both Paris and San Francisco. S.F. leads to a great car chase through the city with a fire truck and eventually the final battle between Zorin and Bond on the wires of the Golden Gate Bridge.Well onto the parts that make me cringe and want to cover my ears in pain. I have mentioned Roger Moore so what else is there. May Day (played by the ugly as I'll ever get out Grace Jones) is just wrong. Really, she's... just... wrong. Tanya Roberts is another girl who as stuck in to look pretty and fawn over James, even she is not good looking. She's also like 30 years younger than Moore so that comes off as awful and creepy. And some of the story, like many since OHMSS, contains quite a lot of filler as I guess they realized their stories and characters were becoming less and less interesting.I can watch A View to a Kill, but only slightly, as this is one of the few times I have viewed it in my life to tell you all about this. Be afraid my readers, be very very afraid.So Roger Moore goes off on the biggest whimper of the series, and is replaced by Timothy Dalton for the next adventure, The Living Daylights.

That is the time that passes in the movie is exactly the same time that passes in the real world. Thus the movie plays out over about an hour and forty minutes, and the same amount of time passes in the world of the movie.An accountant comes into Los Angeles with his beautiful little daughter after going to his ex-wife's funeral. At the railway station, two people, claiming to be police officers (and I do not doubt that they are police officers) approach him and ask him to come with them. Once they are in the van, they hold his daughter hostage and tell him that unless his kills a specific woman within one and a half hours, his daughter will die. It turns out that this woman is the governess of California.The plot is interesting as it turns out that a lot of people have conspired to kill the governor. The reason is that she broke a number of promises when she was elected, and these promises were to her sponsors. She got into office on a business platform, and once she was there, she took a social justice platform, and her one time allies did not like this. This seems to be central in American politics. This I will look at after I look at the plot itself.Everybody was involved in this, but the accountant was simply a scape goat. This becomes even more evident in the closing scenes where at least three people draw guns. What happens though is that there is an Asian guy with a video camera who keeps his eye on the accountant. This is because the accountant is a scape goat and will take the brunt of the public anger while the real conspirators escape. Yet the accountant is very willing to go through with the deed, but only if he does not get caught - this is seen when he is alone in the room with the sleeping governor - but once she awakens his attitude changes. He will do it to save his daughter, but he knows that if he does it, he will go to gaol - or be executed, which is more likely, and his daughter will probably die anyway.This is interesting that the movie also deals with the battle between the left and the right. The right has always been for less state intervention and the free market economy, while the left has been for social justice. Social justice infringes on the free market and as such the right does not like it. LBJ, one of my favourite presidents, was very much for social justice. This movie represents, in a more violent way, the struggle between the right and the left in America - and the right is very much stronger, as we see here. In 1968, when Nixon was elected, it is said that the left and the New Deal, which is represented by the governor, was finally defeated and that the Americans went for a free market economy. It is interesting that the ones who have the power in the movie are those behind the scenes, while everybody seems to be supporting the governor.This movie was alright, and it is that real-time aspect of it that makes it interesting. It is also a decent action movie, and Johnny Depp is a pretty cool actor - especially how he seems to devote himself to independent movies. He actually seems to play the innocent accountant much better than the punk cop.

My final opinion of this movie is that it is good, and quite funny in parts. When the movie's gags stick in my mind then the comedy has succeeded.A Night at the Roxbury are about two brothers who cruise the nightclub circuit of Los Angeles looking for girls. Their dream is to own a night club, but they really are not all that cool. In fact they find themselves thrown out of more night clubs than let into them. Their jokes are funny to them but nobody else. In fact, they live in their own little world in which they want people to be apart of, but the serious people think they are pure donks. What ends up happening is that the owner of the Roxbury, the best nightclub in Los Angeles, actually likes them and wants to implement their ideas, yet his driver thinks him mad and does not like them.This is not the plot though. The main focus of the movie is their relationship with their father. Their father has great plans for them, but they don't want to pursue them. One of them is really unsure, and after they have a fight, he is easily taken away, forced to marry a woman that he really does not like, and to run a business he does not want to run.There is an interesting warning in the movie - don't jump on the woman that chases you around because you will discover that she is trying to mould you to what she wants you to be.

I did not get that much from the movie, but it was reasonably good considering some of the movies that I could have hired (though Object of My Affection is an overnight and I really don't want to pay $3 for it when it is supposed to be an inferior copy of Chasing Amy).Out of Sight is about a superb bankrobber named Jack Foley. He is a very intelligent robber as he gets the money without having to use violence. Instead he bluffs making his victim believe that there are armed men nearby even though there are not. The robbery that we see is evidence of that, and we later discover that he robs this bank without any planning whatsoever. The problem is that his car won't start and he gets caught - but that is only a minor inconvenience to Jack Foley as he manages to escape using a failed escape attempt as a cover. Unfortunately, he is confronted by a federal marshal, Karen Sisco, whom he kidnaps and escapes with.This is where the major plot turns up. Jack falls in love with Karen and vice versa. Both know that this is a difficult relationship, one being a federal marshal and the other being an escaped criminal. In fact this is aiding and abetting a known felon - but nobody other than Jack and his confidant and Karen's father know of this relationship.This movie is about relationships - that which exists between Karen and Jack - and the struggle that they face to come to terms with it. I guess it is an old story two lovers who cannot love because of who they are. This dates back to Romeo and Juliet. Even though it is old, it is an intelligent plot as there is no clear cut solution. Karen knows her job, but she also knows her feelings for Jack. The bedroom scene is one that adds to the character of Karen as she begins to doubt Jack's sincerity, believing he is only doing it for a dare, but he is not. We know Jack and we know that this is not a simple one night stand for him.Jack is really a noble character. He is a bank robber, but he does not use violence, and in fact he has never fired a gun. He is also a very intelligent and observant character. When he sees the accountant in gaol who has a lot of money sequestered away, he protects him believing that he will benefit afterwards. He doesn't ask for money, but rather relies on his generosity - which turns out to be non-existent when he throws a security uniform at Jack and tells him to work his way up from the bottom.I guess, when I think about it, this is a very good movie as it develops the characters and gives them life. I like intelligent and honourable criminals, namely because I have never met one - I guess it is one of those fictions that don't really exist. The characters have their strengths and flaws and each of them is developed independently.

I did not get that much from the movie, but it was reasonably good considering some of the movies that I could have hired (though Object of My Affection is an overnight and I really don't want to pay $3 for it when it is supposed to be an inferior copy of Chasing Amy).Out of Sight is about a superb bankrobber named Jack Foley. He is a very intelligent robber as he gets the money without having to use violence. Instead he bluffs making his victim believe that there are armed men nearby even though there are not. The robbery that we see is evidence of that, and we later discover that he robs this bank without any planning whatsoever. The problem is that his car won't start and he gets caught - but that is only a minor inconvenience to Jack Foley as he manages to escape using a failed escape attempt as a cover. Unfortunately, he is confronted by a federal marshal, Karen Sisco, whom he kidnaps and escapes with.This is where the major plot turns up. Jack falls in love with Karen and vice versa. Both know that this is a difficult relationship, one being a federal marshal and the other being an escaped criminal. In fact this is aiding and abetting a known felon - but nobody other than Jack and his confidant and Karen's father know of this relationship.This movie is about relationships - that which exists between Karen and Jack - and the struggle that they face to come to terms with it. I guess it is an old story two lovers who cannot love because of who they are. This dates back to Romeo and Juliet. Even though it is old, it is an intelligent plot as there is no clear cut solution. Karen knows her job, but she also knows her feelings for Jack. The bedroom scene is one that adds to the character of Karen as she begins to doubt Jack's sincerity, believing he is only doing it for a dare, but he is not. We know Jack and we know that this is not a simple one night stand for him.Jack is really a noble character. He is a bank robber, but he does not use violence, and in fact he has never fired a gun. He is also a very intelligent and observant character. When he sees the accountant in gaol who has a lot of money sequestered away, he protects him believing that he will benefit afterwards. He doesn't ask for money, but rather relies on his generosity - which turns out to be non-existent when he throws a security uniform at Jack and tells him to work his way up from the bottom.I guess, when I think about it, this is a very good movie as it develops the characters and gives them life. I like intelligent and honourable criminals, namely because I have never met one - I guess it is one of those fictions that don't really exist. The characters have their strengths and flaws and each of them is developed independently.

I generally listen to suggestions from people, unless of course it is one particular person and I don't really want to see the movie, as this person has an uncanny ability to become incredibly annoying when trying to convince somebody to do something they really do not want to do. But he's a good bloke anyway.This movie is about a woman who runs away from home after her step-dad dies. She goes and stays with her half-brother, seduces his boyfriend and then leaves for Los Angeles. This begins numerous problems as he is blackmailed by a rather suspicious kid who claims to be this guy's boyfriend as well. It might also be noted to state that the half-brother's former boyfriend, Tom, has died of aids and left him with a lot of money. Tom's sister also hangs around him, and is infatuated with him, but the guy never really takes on. He is gay and he doesn't change, no matter how much we want him to.This movie explores sex, what it is, why people do it, and whether it is bad. The end of the movie sums it all up when she says, I don't want sex, it brings to many bad things such as babies, relationships, commitments and lots of other annoying things. Images of relationships then flash before you, both hetro and homo sexual, and one comes to see the beauty in relationships. It is then that she sits down and says, I guess there are some good things about it.That is the conclusion of this movie - sex is about relationships, though relationships are not always about sex. As is pointed out to the homosexual, he doesn't want his boyfriend for some intellectual type relationship, he wants him for sex, pure and simple. This is something that he does not want to admit, he would rather see it is a side thing for something deeper, but he is kidding himself. What we see is that he doesn't want the intellectual type of thing, he wants sex and he wants it with a man.The girl is different though. She wants the sex without all of the problems, but realises that these problems are not everything. It is the relationships that count. She looks at the relationships and realises that it is a beautiful thing that we have, and sex is just an added bonus.The question of procreation is raised in conjunction with relationships in another clever quote. 'It is interesting how whoever created us made sex so good, and as a means of procreation, because we want sex we will procreate. If it was something like talking on the telephone then nobody would want it and we would die out in a few short years.' I guess this really attacks the heart of humanity - we want sex but we don't want the burdens that come with it burdens such as babies, relationships, commitments, and even reputation. Just as the gay guy argued that he wanted the intellectual side of the relationship to protect his reputation, it was only a dream. It was only when the woman confronted him with it that he came to accept that it was the sex he was after.I feel that this is a very intelligent film with deep character development and a running commentary on what is going on. My only criticism is when the two guys kiss and the narrator says, now girls, if your boyfriend groaned at what just happened then he is definitely a closet. She then proceeded to run off a number of redneck attributes, indicating that if you are anti-homosexual the you must be gay. This is only supported by the fact that some of the most powerful men in America were very anti-homosexual and also closet homosexuals. Just because you don't agree with it does not mean you are a closet homosexual.

And the introduction to this world was the best thing about this film. One of the finest efforts in the Pixar universe. The idea of children as energy sources is the core of the film and possibly the main reason why it succeeds so impressively. The doors as means of transit from the monster world into the human world. The simulators where the not-so-experienced monsters can improve their abilities. It all oozes creativity. Another strength of this film is that its supporting characters are at least as interesting as the two monsters in the lead. I don't think we need to talk about Mike and Sully much. Their actions and presence speak for themselves. One is huge, furry and truly scary, yet kind-hearted, the other is tiny, slippery (at least that's what he looks like, like a frog), always funny and obviously a bit of a womanizer. And yet, they're best friends. Beyond these two,the monster world includes creatures of all sizes, shapes and colors, so they're a feast visually, but with some the writers also succeeded to make them truly entertaining and effective. The two antagonists are really a scary presence, thanks to their looks with all those tentacles for example on Coburn's character or their ability to turn invisible (Buscemi). Two more I liked One would be Mike's girlfriend who gave me a true LOL-moment when she talks during the date about how she may be interested in a shorter haircut and we see those snakes that actually are her hair go into full panic mode for a moment. The other is the poor Monster Inc. worker who got showered and sheared when they discover a baby sock on his back. His reaction when there is one on his back again later into the film was pretty hilarious. Well done. The exterminators were pretty hilarious too, even if you didn't see any physical trademarks on them as they were all covered by their huge uniforms. There's just so many great characters and I'm certainly forgetting some. Already all those they see when they go to work. Thankfully Sully kept Mike from taking the car, otherwise we would have missed all these.When the whole part of introducing us to the monster world ends and the real story starts with the little girl enters the picture, it gets slightly worse, but only because it was so great before. Boo is still the cutest thing ever (gotta love how she keeps saying Mike's name) and the way Sully slowly grows paternal feelings for her is displayed with lots of heart. Afterwards we see the usual ingredients, the villains seemingly gaining the upper hand, characters being exposed as surprisingly good or bad, the main characters' friendships put to test, Sully to Boo and Sully to Mike etc. The latter actually happens in the Himalayas and features a funny cameo of the The Abominable Snowman and his snow cones. The only thing from the film which did not really interest me, was the action sequence and all the main characters riding on the doors on their fight for little Boo. That felt really only for children in the audience again. I won't complain though as not only the way the two villains got it in the end (crocodile reference, simulator exposure) and the twist of turning the scream factory into a laughter factory were very well-made again and the epilogue with Mike having built the door to Boo fully together will hopefully give you an equally warm feeling in your chest as it did for me. Boo? Kitty! with the huge smile entering Sully's face was truly a perfect way to end the movie. Easily among Pixar's best and very much recommended for people all ages.

Beyond these two,the monster world includes creatures of all sizes, shapes and colors, so they're a feast visually, but with some the writers also succeeded to make them truly entertaining and effective. The two antagonists are really a scary presence, thanks to their looks with all those tentacles for example on Coburn's character or their ability to turn invisible (Buscemi). Two more I liked One would be Mike's girlfriend who gave me a true LOL-moment when she talks during the date about how she may be interested in a shorter haircut and we see those snakes that actually are her hair go into full panic mode for a moment. The other is the poor Monster Inc. worker who got showered and sheared when they discover a baby sock on his back. His reaction when there is one on his back again later into the film was pretty hilarious. Well done. The exterminators were pretty hilarious too, even if you didn't see any physical trademarks on them as they were all covered by their huge uniforms. There's just so many great characters and I'm certainly forgetting some. Already all those they see when they go to work. Thankfully Sully kept Mike from taking the car, otherwise we would have missed all these.When the whole part of introducing us to the monster world ends and the real story starts with the little girl enters the picture, it gets slightly worse, but only because it was so great before. Boo is still the cutest thing ever (gotta love how she keeps saying Mike's name) and the way Sully slowly grows paternal feelings for her is displayed with lots of heart. Afterwards we see the usual ingredients, the villains seemingly gaining the upper hand, characters being exposed as surprisingly good or bad, the main characters' friendships put to test, Sully to Boo and Sully to Mike etc. The latter actually happens in the Himalayas and features a funny cameo of the The Abominable Snowman and his snow cones. The only thing from the film which did not really interest me, was the action sequence and all the main characters riding on the doors on their fight for little Boo. That felt really only for children in the audience again. I won't complain though as not only the way the two villains got it in the end (crocodile reference, simulator exposure) and the twist of turning the scream factory into a laughter factory were very well-made again and the epilogue with Mike having built the door to Boo fully together will hopefully give you an equally warm feeling in your chest as it did for me. Boo? Kitty! with the huge smile entering Sully's face was truly a perfect way to end the movie. Easily among Pixar's best and very much recommended for people all ages.

And the introduction to this world was the best thing about this film. One of the finest efforts in the Pixar universe. The idea of children as energy sources is the core of the film and possibly the main reason why it succeeds so impressively. The doors as means of transit from the monster world into the human world. The simulators where the not-so-experienced monsters can improve their abilities. It all oozes creativity. Another strength of this film is that its supporting characters are at least as interesting as the two monsters in the lead. I don't think we need to talk about Mike and Sully much. Their actions and presence speak for themselves. One is huge, furry and truly scary, yet kind-hearted, the other is tiny, slippery (at least that's what he looks like, like a frog), always funny and obviously a bit of a womanizer. And yet, they're best friends.

She's less convincing as an Ugly Duckling though, but if Audrey Hepburn is supposed to be 'physically forgettable', and transform into a glamorous woman in one change of haircut and wardrobe, but since it's a fairy tale comedy, so let's just accept that Sabrina starts as an average adolescent to better emphasize her status as an underdog heroine.Sabrina lives in the Larrabees' mansion in Long Island, as the chauffeur's daughter. In other words, she doesn't belong to that world, but is close enough to dream about being one of these attractive and classy rich girls, just because it's the only way to catch the eye, then the heart of David Larrabee, whose idleness and three consecutive marriages never discouraged her. Why not? William Holden, as a rich and handsome playboy, is the perfect 50's version of the Charming Prince. Yet David doesn't care much for Sabrina, not until she comes back after two years of cooking-study in Paris, as an unrecognizably sophisticated lady.Again, we accept the idea that David wouldn't recognize the chauffeur's daughter, and the subsequent misunderstanding, if not hilarious, is amusing in a cute way. Sabrina finally won his heart, by becoming one of these women he always coveted, and we're supposed to cheer for that. As innocent a comedy as it is, the content gets incredibly shallow and superficial, but it's a credit to the casting of Hepburn, who's so hypnotically herself, that she gets away with it. Simply said, her gorgeous face and innocent expression make any negative thought impossible.Naturally, the on-going romance meets disapproval, starting with Sabrina's father, played by a caring and loving John Williams (the detective in Dial M for Murder), who wished Sabrina's trip in Paris would cure his daughter from her obsession named David, while Paris only helped her to see life in rose-colored glasses. The Larrabees are also concerned because Sabrina undermines their plan to marry David with the daughter of a powerful conglomerate President and make a highly profitable merger. This is where Linus, David's no non-sense and all-business brother, played by Humphrey Bogart, intervenes.To prevent his brother from the temptation of flying away with Sabrina, Linus spends time with her, planning on a short-term to send her alone to Paris. But the story deals with these relationships rather ambiguously, Davis is in love with Sabrina but never makes efforts to cancel the wedding and we're never sure about the sincerity of Linus' growing affection toward Sabrina. These considerations disappear the time of a magical moment when Audrey Hepburn sings La Vie en Rose, a sweet and timelessly magical interlude that makes us forget the course of the story and gives the film its true reason-to-be.Now, when I watch a romantic comedy, I usually keep in mind the genre-defining pattern consisting on two people that everything opposes, and who end up together at the end. Being the obligatory principle borrowed from fairy tales, we judge a romance less from its predictable outcome than the way it gets to it. And because Linus was cynically about to break a fragile heart like the necessary egg to make the marriage's omelet possible, and because of the ambivalent attitude of David, I didn't know with whom Sabrina should have been to make a satisfying ending. What Sabrina saw in David I could understand, given how immature she was, but what she saw in Linus, I couldn't get either, given how grown-up she became.But this is not a flaw on the story, which is written by Billy Wilder with the usual amount of talent and wit, indispensable for a comedy no matter how unsubtle some situations can get. The film has its share of gags, corny lines, a comic-relief William Hampden as Larrabee's distracted patriarch and even Billy Holden plays his role in an over-the-top joviality as if he really enjoyed being that guy, and his enthusiasm was quite communicative. But there is something strange going between Hepburn and Bogart, precisely because they played their roles with sincerity and believability.Indeed, Sabrina was like a little flower who finally bloom under the sun of optimism and confidence and yet she was trapped in the middle of a business plot that tried not to buy her love, but to console her broken heart with it. And it's precisely because Bogie plays the role with his own dramatic note that I could believe his infatuation and the subsequent redemption. But right performances don't make believable chemistry just like good ingredient don't make a good recipe&#x85; and I'm sure the 'all in the wrist' French chief cook wouldn't contradict me.It's commonly known that Bogart took the last minute role turned down by Cary Grant, and I'm afraid to admit that Grant would have done a great job given how used he is to romantic comedies, and how similar he looks to Holden. Not that Bogart wasn't convincing, but he gave some gravity to his performance, totally contrasting with Holden's jollity, and it's not surprising that Hepburn fell in love with Holden during the shooting, screens don't lie, their chemistry was real.As much as I enjoy the film, I can only judge the romantic comedy from its ending, and on that level, no matter how prestigious the package Hepburn, Bogart, Holden and Wilder was, the conclusion was really telling about how awkward the relationship was a hug, just a hug. Sabrina deserved more, and so did we, and maybe this is why I looked forward to watching the 1995' remake.

Basically he plays his main character, the Professor, Buddy Love (the only character without heaps of makeup), his mother, father, brother, and grandmother. The skill at which this is done is shown in the two scenes when they are all sitting around a table arguing. I doubt this is because Murphy is cheap but rather because he wants to do it. The other thing that is impressive is the skill that goes into the makeup to disguise Murphy.The Nutty Professor is about a professor, Sherman Klumpp, who is incredibly fat. He is very conscious about his size, and after being torn to shreds by a comedian when he is out on a date with an attractive colleague, he decides to imbue a formula that he has been developing. Sure enough he turns into a handsome, slender, man who calls himself Buddy Love.Basically this movie has a number of themes and is based upon Dr Jeckal and Mr Hyde. I have not had the pleasure of reading the book, so I do not know the themes of the original (I think it has something to do with the beast that is within man), but here the roles are reversed. The beast is Buddy Love while the Dr is Sherman Klumpp. Klumpp may not be attractive, but he is a nice, kind hearted man while Buddy Love is a sexual tyrant who couldn't care less about anybody else. In fact, the more he becomes Buddy Love, the worse he gets.I guess the theme is be content with yourself. Even though Klumpp is hideously fat and his family are incredibly filthy, Dr Purty, the woman that Klumpp likes, thinks that he is okay. She not only went out on a date with him, but also tolerated his family. Another theme is that good looks doesn't always mean a good heart. Buddy Love is a womaniser who couldn't care less about what others think. He may be a fast talker, but that does not work on those who have come close to him, like Miss Purty.This is an Eddie Murphy film, and as such I like it a lot. It is a movie that one can watch while turning off ones' brain. Okay, there is a Jeckle and Hyde theme running through, but it isn't as serious as other rumours that I have seen.

He is very conscious about his size, and after being torn to shreds by a comedian when he is out on a date with an attractive colleague, he decides to imbue a formula that he has been developing. Sure enough he turns into a handsome, slender, man who calls himself Buddy Love.Basically this movie has a number of themes and is based upon Dr Jeckal and Mr Hyde. I have not had the pleasure of reading the book, so I do not know the themes of the original (I think it has something to do with the beast that is within man), but here the roles are reversed. The beast is Buddy Love while the Dr is Sherman Klumpp. Klumpp may not be attractive, but he is a nice, kind hearted man while Buddy Love is a sexual tyrant who couldn't care less about anybody else. In fact, the more he becomes Buddy Love, the worse he gets.I guess the theme is be content with yourself. Even though Klumpp is hideously fat and his family are incredibly filthy, Dr Purty, the woman that Klumpp likes, thinks that he is okay. She not only went out on a date with him, but also tolerated his family. Another theme is that good looks doesn't always mean a good heart. Buddy Love is a womaniser who couldn't care less about what others think. He may be a fast talker, but that does not work on those who have come close to him, like Miss Purty.This is an Eddie Murphy film, and as such I like it a lot. It is a movie that one can watch while turning off ones' brain. Okay, there is a Jeckle and Hyde theme running through, but it isn't as serious as other rumours that I have seen. This is simply fun movie. ","genre":"Comedy, Romance, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"18 October 2013","score":"","review":" I waited a long time to watch this movie because I thought it was going to suck major.

It was a project long in the making and it took many years to finally make the screen. The result is an epic film that covers four decades in the lives of a gang of Jewish hoodlums from Ney York's Lower East Side. It's told in a fractured time structure specifically covering the years 1922, 1933 and 1968. In the earliest period the characters are boys, entering the world of crime, in the middle section they are at the height of their powers as gangsters in the prohibition era, while in the latter year the story climaxes when they are old men. It isn't told chronologically though. There are flash-backs and flash-forwards; and in this way the film can deal with themes of memories, guilt and redemption much better, while it is able to conceal plot twists far more effectively. The story is essentially about the relationship between Noodles and Max, childhood friends who grew up to be gangsters. Noodles returns to New York in '68 after being in self-imposed exile for 35 years. He seemingly sold out his friends and is haunted by this memory but he soon realises on arrival that events in his past were not as they seemed.Once Upon a Time in America is less celebratory of the gangster lifestyle than most other films in its genre. Most others show the criminals in their pomp and glory, so that the audience can understand why they lead the life they do. But here, we don't see too much of that. Mostly it's in actuality about the wasted lives of gangsters. The regrets they have about their previous ways and how it destroys them. This is compounded by the fact that there are really no likable characters in it at all. The central character Noodles, who is the emotional core of the film, is shown to be a killer and a rapist. So as the film progresses it is somewhat difficult feeling too sorry for his plight. It's quite a brave move for the movie to have such unsympathetic leads. Robert De Niro and James Woods offer up excellent portrayals of these damaged men though and we do believe in them, even if it is hard to like them. But, as a contrast to the violence and grimness of the story it looks very grand. The period is recreated with fine detail and the cinematography enhances this. It is a very lavish looking film indeed.I do have one issue though and that's its length. At three hours and forty minutes this is an excessively long film. Some people say that it needs to be this length to tell its story properly. I disagree. If Coppola or Scorsese had wanted they could have fleshed The Godfather or Goodfellas out to the same length with extra detail and character development. Anybody could really. It does not necessarily make a film better by simply adding more in. Three hours seems more than enough for the story of Once Upon a Time in America and a bit of editing could easily have made it tighter and more concise without losing anything of significant consequence. The shorter, less exhausting, time-span would improve it. I don't like saying it but at twenty minutes shy of four hours Leone was being a little self-indulgent.But time issues aside, this is still one of the gangster films from the upper bracket of the genre.

It was too great a coincidence but I thought it was meant to be from and of Ava Gardner, and only Ava Gardner, for her biography is one of these peculiar cases when reality is strangely more fascinating than fiction, especially when the kind of fiction we're talking about is fairy tale. Now I even realize that The Barefoot Cinderella who'd have been quite a fitting title, if only to sustain the idea that this was a princess who had everything to triumph over adversity, looks, heart and that inspiring sparkle in the eye, but no Prince at all&#x85; and what more tragic than a Cinderella remaining barefoot? And Ava Gardner was that kind of Cinderella-figure. She was uniquely beautiful; she was revered as one of the most beautiful actresses of the world, if not the most. And despite all the looks she had, and the stardom she was brought to, she never felt totally happy, she had only three men, no children, and left the silver screen with mixed memories. How can a woman blessed by such a voluptuous body and illuminating face, kept such a miserable opinion on a success served on a silver, no, golden plate? That's the kind of mystery The Barefoot Contessa tries to give answers, and if seriously, they didn't think about Gardner before writing the story, then her casting, is quite a strike of genius.The film opens when producer Kirk Edwards comes to a Spanish bar with his publicist Oscar Muldoon (Oscar-winning Edmund O'Brien) and director-writer Harry Dawes (Humphrey Bogart) to find a new face. They heard of a beautiful dancer named Maria Vargas but she trusts neither of Edwards or Muldoon. It's to Dawes that she finally opens her heart, expressing her fear of success, her eagerness to keep her feet on the dirt, as if the heights of success would make her dizzy. She likes movies though, but she doesn't trust herself, nor her capability to find love in this world, let alone there. This is not the little girl from Madrid slums talking, this is the earthy daughter of North Carolina who loved to go barefoot before luck brought her to MGM. But Cinema for Dawes is as unimaginable without Maria than ours without Ava, he convinces her give happiness the benefit of the doubt.The relationship between Dawes and Maria is particularly poignant and given the two actor's age more acceptable than Bogart with Hepburn in the film of the same year Sabrina. Maria is a beautiful flower waiting to bloom and Dawes her guardian angel. But after three movies made together, she was able to fly with her own wings, and became a star among the stars, as admired as envied. The story is told from flashbacks during her funereal from Dawes, Muldoon and Maria's two lovers, a frivolous Latin American playboy Alberto Bravano (Marius Goring), and Count Vincenzo Torlato-Favrini (Rossano Brazzi). And what is interesting is less the relationship she has with these men than the way she gets into and out off one's arms, before her tragic ending.All through the film, we never know to which extent Maria lead her destiny, she's indeed a fairy-tale heroine with enough determination and courage to seize the situation but still guided by destiny. She was reluctant to go with Bravano, but only because Edwards forbid her, she challenged him. Then she challenges Bravano, by turning her back on the decadence of casinos and jet-set, and still dance on the mud near a Gypsy camp and this is where the Count meets her. The Counts has everything of a Charming Prince, but seems to hold a terrible secret, which would ultimately seal Maria's fate, the one that kept Cinderella forever barefoot, and to which the erected statue plays like a poignant epitaph.It's true that some choices, some actions are questionable given the context of the film, and their purposes seem to be their convenience to a plot leading to its tragic conclusion, but it's all in the 'bad movies' line as if Maria's life was in fact, the worst movie she ever made, and when every now and then, someone utters a kind of corny line, it's like the screenwriter apologizing in advance. That whole intricacy between reality and fiction is cleverly handled, which is not surprising coming from the director of All About Eve, whom the film borrows some elements through the opening and the different perspective of Maria's life from the others' perspective. All About Eve remains superior if only because it had the perfect balance between action and talk, I must admit in Barefoot Contessa, Mankiewciz took our patience for granted, which didn't leave much screen time to the most dramatic and poignant parts. Appreciating The Barefoot Contessa is understanding some bits of Ava Gardner, an unusual star who despised her stardom because she felt there was more to life than playing the star, and incongruously, that kind of attitude made her an even more glorious star, because paraphrasing Bogie, that's the stuff great movies are made on.

That's the kind of mystery The Barefoot Contessa tries to give answers, and if seriously, they didn't think about Gardner before writing the story, then her casting, is quite a strike of genius.The film opens when producer Kirk Edwards comes to a Spanish bar with his publicist Oscar Muldoon (Oscar-winning Edmund O'Brien) and director-writer Harry Dawes (Humphrey Bogart) to find a new face. They heard of a beautiful dancer named Maria Vargas but she trusts neither of Edwards or Muldoon. It's to Dawes that she finally opens her heart, expressing her fear of success, her eagerness to keep her feet on the dirt, as if the heights of success would make her dizzy. She likes movies though, but she doesn't trust herself, nor her capability to find love in this world, let alone there. This is not the little girl from Madrid slums talking, this is the earthy daughter of North Carolina who loved to go barefoot before luck brought her to MGM. But Cinema for Dawes is as unimaginable without Maria than ours without Ava, he convinces her give happiness the benefit of the doubt.The relationship between Dawes and Maria is particularly poignant and given the two actor's age more acceptable than Bogart with Hepburn in the film of the same year Sabrina. Maria is a beautiful flower waiting to bloom and Dawes her guardian angel. But after three movies made together, she was able to fly with her own wings, and became a star among the stars, as admired as envied. The story is told from flashbacks during her funereal from Dawes, Muldoon and Maria's two lovers, a frivolous Latin American playboy Alberto Bravano (Marius Goring), and Count Vincenzo Torlato-Favrini (Rossano Brazzi). And what is interesting is less the relationship she has with these men than the way she gets into and out off one's arms, before her tragic ending.All through the film, we never know to which extent Maria lead her destiny, she's indeed a fairy-tale heroine with enough determination and courage to seize the situation but still guided by destiny. She was reluctant to go with Bravano, but only because Edwards forbid her, she challenged him. Then she challenges Bravano, by turning her back on the decadence of casinos and jet-set, and still dance on the mud near a Gypsy camp and this is where the Count meets her. The Counts has everything of a Charming Prince, but seems to hold a terrible secret, which would ultimately seal Maria's fate, the one that kept Cinderella forever barefoot, and to which the erected statue plays like a poignant epitaph.It's true that some choices, some actions are questionable given the context of the film, and their purposes seem to be their convenience to a plot leading to its tragic conclusion, but it's all in the 'bad movies' line as if Maria's life was in fact, the worst movie she ever made, and when every now and then, someone utters a kind of corny line, it's like the screenwriter apologizing in advance. That whole intricacy between reality and fiction is cleverly handled, which is not surprising coming from the director of All About Eve, whom the film borrows some elements through the opening and the different perspective of Maria's life from the others' perspective. All About Eve remains superior if only because it had the perfect balance between action and talk, I must admit in Barefoot Contessa, Mankiewciz took our patience for granted, which didn't leave much screen time to the most dramatic and poignant parts. Appreciating The Barefoot Contessa is understanding some bits of Ava Gardner, an unusual star who despised her stardom because she felt there was more to life than playing the star, and incongruously, that kind of attitude made her an even more glorious star, because paraphrasing Bogie, that's the stuff great movies are made on.
