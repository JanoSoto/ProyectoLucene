I'm sick of it happening again, I don't want to do this any more. I felt like applauding at that point.For me that speech was not only this film but the whole concept of the X-files in a nutshell.Nothing of any real consequence occurs in this film, nothing at all. It's simply two FBI agents occasionally being chased, or chasing someone, or looking puzzled. They sometimes find physical evidence of a government conspiracy to do something terrible, but the evidence is without exception snatched away or destroyed (or forgotten by the writers). Sometimes we might even see the conspirators talking about these forthcoming terrible events in very vague terms. The terrible events never, ever happened in the series. However, I was hopeful that with a cinema budget they might stretch to showing an alien invasion or two. Perhaps the writers had only been teasing the audience until they had the money to give their intended cataclysm justice on the big screen. Alas, all we get is an exploding building (destroying evidence), an exploding car (destroying evidence) and some snow falling into an empty hole. Nothing you wouldn't find in a TV Movie.The dialogue is awful too, Mulder is continuously told that he's barely scratched the surface of the conspiracy. I'd wager a good amount of money that he's actually gone right through the surface a long time ago and exhausted all the plot we're ever going to get out of Chris Carter. When we find out what this conspiracy involves, it's actually a very very dull mix of Alien and V, about extraterrestrials conquering the earth with the help of ambitious humans with a view to feeding on human bodies. Doctor Who also used this plot several times over in the 60s and 70s.In the X-Files, essentially, nothing happens, to the characters, to their status or their plans, and for the worst of reasons, because the producers want to string this franchise out for as long as they can make money from it. The aliens will never invade, but neither will Mulder ever prove to anyone that they exist, I can tell you that right now. I can also tell you that if all this *is* ever resolved in a final film or episode, it will turn out to be a disappointing cop-out.One of the other reviewers on IMDB compared the X-Files film to Hitchcock, but Hitchcock actually satisfied his audience by showing the little guy cleverly fighting back and eventually triumphing over the dark conspiracy against him. There was methodical progression, there was movement, there was excitement, tension and engagement. Hitchcock films are thrilling because you believe the hero might win or the villain might kill him. You know the conclusion is just round the corner, whatever happens.In the X-Files we *know* that Mulder will never be killed (the evil conspirators say they will not kill him for fear of making him a martyr). Unfortunately, we also *know* that Mulder will never win, because then they couldn't make a sequel to this single-issue drama. There is no thrill in the X-Files because the basic premise of the film (and indeed series), its ground rules, demand that ultimately nothing happens for the sake of extending the franchise. It's just aimless wandering.Sorry to be crude, but the X-Files is like perpetual Coitus Interruptus.The only vaguely memorable scene is Martin Landau p***ing in an alley.

Some Spoiler Content.As an avid reader of the books I've been anticipating the release of the movie for months with mixed feelings. A part of me has been eager to see how the magical world of moving pictures, quiditch and magical lessons would appear visually on a movie screen, another part of me has been reluctant to relinquish my own imagination to the imagination of the directors and producers of the film.Regardless I went to see the show opening night. I went in knowing that the movie would not be as good as the book, movie adaptations never are. But I also knew that the producers had attempted to keep the integrity of the story and characters in tact. I was not disappointed by what I saw. The casting director deserves an award for being bang on for every character. The Dursleys were almost as I had pictured them, though I was disappointed they weren't portrayed as mean as they are in the books, though I understand that time was an issue, and it really didn't take away from the story.But it was the children, especially Ron, and Hermione that really stole the show, Emma Watson was perfect as the supersmart, bossy Hermione, they couldn't have chosen a better actress for the role. And Rupert Grint was beyond adorable as Ron. The adult roles too were perfect, especially Snape, McGonagal, and Dubledore.As for the story, with the exception of 2 scenes I thought it was done beautifully. Combined with just the right amount of special effects, it seemed that this world of wonder and magic could really exist. The Quiditch match was by far the highlight of the movie for me, and though I have heard some people say that it seemed unimportant to the story, I believe it was in fact essential. In the story of Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone, Harry is discovering this world of magic for the first time, Quiditch is a part of this world and is therefore essential to his feeling of wonderment, and eventually belonging. All his life he's never belonged anywhere and suddenly he's an essential player in the biggest game of the Wizarding world... not to mention the fact that he becomes a hero... not for something that happened when he was a baby and doesn't remember but for something he has done here and now. This is essential to understanding the character of Harry, not to mention it looked amazing!My biggest complaint about the movie is that the dragon thing was changed too much, they should have either expanded it a little more, or left it out completely because as it was it really didn't flow with the rest of the movie. My only other complaint is the omission near the end of the movie, where the kids are going through the obstacles to get to the stone. After the chess game there is supposed to be a potions riddle that Hermione helps Harry solve before he goes on by himself to encounter the last challenge. The fact that this was omitted makes very little sense to me, as it is mentioned earlier that Snape is one of the teachers protecting the stone yet his protection does not exist.Other than this I found the movie overall very enjoyable and I eagerly await the 5th book and the next movies. Though it baffles me to think how they will adapt the 4th book without butchering it or turning it into an 8 hour epic!!! I definitely recommend this movie, but I still think to truly appreciate this movie, you need to read the books.10\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"21 November 2001","score":"","review":"  WARNING!

Felissa Rose seems to be the only player in this film who can act. Though she doesn't have many lines, she does appear in most of the scenes. The other actors for some reason, just don't get it right. The creative murder scenes and some bad soap opera lines make this fun to watch, just for the camp of it. Warning Watch the last 5 minutes at your own risk. ","genre":"Horror"}]
