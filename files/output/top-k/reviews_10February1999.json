Tora! works for the most part when it sticks to actual history.  And I know because watching this film as a child on television in the late 1970s inspired me to read more about it, and with the real names of the commanders and flyers already ingrained in my mind thanks to the film, it started a fascination that has endured to this day.Unfortunately, the film is ruined by having less stellar production values than Tora did.  First mistake is having the Japanese characters speak English, instead of the subtitles approach which worked well in Tora. This decision really comes home to roost when the great Japanese actor Toshiro Mifune, as Admiral Yammamoto, is dubbed by cartoon voice Paul Frees, which ruins the effectiveness of the scenes every time Yammamoto opens his mouth.Also bad is the whole unnecessary subplot involving Charlton Heston and his son and his son's Nisei fiancee.  It is so irrelevant, and valuable screen time that could have been spent on the sinking of the Yorktown or other aspects of the battle get lost completely as a result.Still, Midway is a competent way of introducing people to the real history of the turning point of WWII in the Pacific.  It's worth a look in both its theatrical version and expanded TV version.  And John Williams, in his next-to-last score before Star Wars turns in a fine effort.
