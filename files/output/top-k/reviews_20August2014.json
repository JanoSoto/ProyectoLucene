Basically it is a desperate description of drug use in the modern American big city.

Especially Jared Letos work is stunning although other main characters perform excellent as well.

","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"20 August 2014","score":"","review":" Who would think that the story of an elderly couple spending what is possibly their last summer together on their New England lake-front cottage and resolving old issues could end up being the surprise hit of the 1981 Christmas movie season? When those two elderly people are the legendary Henry Fonda and Katharine Hepburn, the curiosity is definitely a factor in attracting audiences, but quick great reviews and excellent word of mouth made this pack audiences in. Even the young film audiences in a year filled with Raiders of the Lost Ark, Clash of the Titans and Arthur flocked to see this, and now they are passing their discovery onto their own children.Norman Thayer is the epitome of the grouchy octogenarian who has been estranged from his daughter Chelsea (Jane Fonda) for many years. She has remained close to her mother Ethel (Thounds like I'm listhsping, Norman says in a more lighthearted moment as he reveals that her impending married name almost kept him from meeting her down the church aisle) but the rebellious teenaged years and not so understanding, strict father kept her from establishing a close bond with him as an adult. Now she's engaged to dentist Bill Ray (Dabney Coleman in a role a far cry from his lecherous boss in Nine to Five, also with Jane) and soon to be stepmother to his son Billy Ray (Doug McKeon) whom she wants Norman and Ethel to take care of while she goes on a trip to Europe with Coleman. Much to Ethel's delight, Norman and Billy begin to bond, and when Chelsea returns, she finds herself envious over the new friendship which she has pined for but never pursued.Many of us can identify with the cold relationship between Norman and Chelsea, as well as Norman's bonding with the young boy who doesn't seem to fear him as Chelsea obviously did. The entire cast gives bravo performances, but it is the Oscar Winning Henry Fonda and Katharine Hepburn (her fourth!) who dominate here. At times, you do want to slap Jane like Cher did to Nicolas Cage in Moonstruck and yell, Snap out of it!, but as she discloses, even a successful businesswoman can find her old insecurities rising when confronted with a past she hasn't been able to get over. Katharine is wise and understanding, but even she isn't above disciplining her embittered daughter. That son of a bitch is my husband!, she reminds Jane. To see father and daughter working together after so much history of differences in their own lives and really bonding is touching, as it is to see Henry and Kate together in their first and only film. Then, there's seeing the rebel of the 1930's (Kate) with the rebel of the 70's (Jane), and there is magic in this mother\/daughter pairing.McKeon strikes a cord here, too, working well with the older actors, especially Henry. The direction by Mark Rydell is superb, and the lake setting is gorgeous. I can tell you from experience that having spent several summers on New England set lakes in cottages exactly like this, the movie's reality level increased for me because of how similar it looked. Dave Grusin's music is also gorgeous, whether profound and sad as the opening credits play, to triumphant as McKeon takes the Thayers boat out on his own, to bittersweet as the closing credits roll after Ethel and Norman have bid farewell to their summer home which we all hope will not be their last there together. This has been successfully remade for T.V. and revived on Broadway, but there will never be another version like this, and it will enter your heart for eternity just as Kate says lovingly to Norman, You are my knight in shining armor. Keep the handkerchief handy, even if this is a repeat viewing.

With this movie, director Rob Reiner along with fellow writer\/actors Michael McKean, Harry Shearer and Christopher Guest devised a type of comedy that it took decades for everybody else to catch up with. The trick was that they delivered very funny material in a manner that always held on to reality. There is never any over comic acting or nudging to camera, the humour is consistently grounded in reality and that is core quality of the film. Many of the very best subsequent TV comedies have taken this approach religiously, such as 'I Am Alan Partridge', 'The Office', 'Curb Your Enthusiasm' &#x96; amongst many others. The influence of Spinal Tap is immeasurable in this sense. Back in the early 80's this comedy style was pretty uncommon and hence many thought that this mockumentary was in fact a documentary.The performances are crucial with the three leads being particularly brilliant and all side characters being quite excellent as well. A lot of the dialogue was improvised and this explains the naturalistic flow of things &#x96; you can easily re-watch this and discover brilliant lines buried in overlapping dialogue for example. This is one of those films that really doesn't feel like it should be reviewed in the traditional sense because there are simply far too many moments of comedy genius that recounting them all would take forever. It's quite simply a movie that just needs to be seen. It never gets old in any way and remains as funny now as it ever was.
