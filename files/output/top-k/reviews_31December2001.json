Right before it came on AMC last night, the introduction said that it is an allegory, so I suppose my review would not be complete without my interpretation of that.We first see that Roy Hobbs (Robert Redford) is a natural in baseball, grows up at age 20 to be a pitching phenom, and on a train stop as he was going forward with his dream of I want to walk down the street and have people say 'he was the best ever', in a dare and a bet he strikes out the Whammer (Babe Ruth?) in 3 pitches. A lady (Barbara Hershey) seems attracted to him, but when he restates that he only wants to be recognized as the best ever, she shoots him, in the side, and we learn later that she threw herself off a high place onto the street below, dead. We find out much later that McGavin's character had lost $100,000 on that wager, and I took care of him.  Meaning, he was the one who hired the Hershey character to shoot Hobbs. Hobbs only realizes that at the finale, when he has to choose whether to try and win the game, or give in to McGavin's attempt to fix the game.Meanwhile, back at the beginning, Hobbs was out of baseball 16 years, recovering from his gunshot, and dealing with his infatuation with the temptress known as fame. He is recruited as a 35-yr-old rookie, almost never gets into a game, and finally using his bat carved from the old lightning-struck tree, becomes a batting phenom, the best hitter they ever saw. When he starts fooling around with temptress Kim Basinger, he suddenly cannot hit anymore. When he sees Glen Close again, he suddenly becomes a hitting machine again. He ultimately wins the big playoff game, sending the bad guys reeling.At one point, Close's character tells Hobbs, I believe we have two lives, the one we learn with, and the one we live with. Hobbs was a victim of the want of fame, so much so it de-railed his career. Only after he learned to play baseball for the sheer enjoyment of it did he achieve the success he wanted, but fame was no longer a need. It is almost the same theme in Big, where Hanks' character is a success because he remains a kid, enjoying what he is doing, while all the others just want to run a business and make a buck. Good movie, Redford is always good. The baseball sequences are fairly well done, and the moral is positive. I think many who enjoyed Costner's For Love of the Game would also enjoy The Natural.

Here is a film all about the nature of short-term memory, which, by its own ingenious structure, challenges the audience to cope with its own mastery of short-term memory.  Guy Pearce stars as Leonard Shelby, a man who suffers from a `condition' brought on by a trauma to the head that prevents him from being able to retain any short-term memories (he can remember his life only up to the moment of his wife's rape and murder).  To cope with his affliction, Leonard writes himself copious notes, mostly on the backs of polaroids he takes on a regular basis but sometimes on his own body in the form of informational tattoos.  To approximate the sense of dislocation of time and place that Leonard feels on a daily basis &#150; as he has to reorient himself to people and events he has recently met and since forgotten - Nolan has chosen to structure his film in a backward progression, so that the first scene ends up being the most recent and the final scene the earliest in time.  This technique is not exactly an original one, since the 1983 movie `Betrayal' used roughly the same format in the context of a romantic drama.  Still, `Memento' deserves enormous credit not only for trusting its audience to be able to cope with this complex style but for managing to keep most of the plot details well-focused and coherent for most of the film's duration.One of the risks of a film like `Memento' is that it could, if handled badly, easily become a mere exercise in technical `gimmickry.'  One of the ways that Nolan avoids that trap is by devising a plot that is as gripping as any to be found in a traditionally structured example of film noir.  `Memento' is filled with the kinds of narrative twists and turns, surprise revelations and moral ambiguities that form the basis for any good example of the genre.  More important, Nolan makes Leonard a compellingly sympathetic character, one whom we come to care for because his plight is so heartrending at its core.  Here is a man who not only has to deal with the immense incomprehensibilities of his life but who cannot even benefit from the time factor that helps mourning people come to terms with the loss of a loved one.  To Leonard, his wife's death is a perpetual recent event, one from which he can never attain that emotional distance so key to finally overcoming his grief.Special note should be taken of Guy Pearce, who delivers a knockout performance as Leonard, perfectly capturing the determination, frustration and emotional pain that define the character.  Carrie-Ann Moss and Joe Pantoliano offer superb support as two perpetual `strangers' who play significant roles in Leonard's strangely dislocated and fragmented life &#150; yet just what those roles are is as much a mystery to us as it is to Leonard.  David Julyan's subtle and haunting musical score and Wally Pfister's fine cinematography greatly contribute to the unique quality of the film.Watching `Memento' is like entering a strange, mystical dream.  Like Leonard, we feel as if we have suddenly been stripped of that ability to fully make sense out of the chaotic world around us.  We feel cut loose from our mental moorings and find ourselves adrift in a world bereft of the rules of chronological reasoning we cling to so desperately for survival.  How many movies actually manage to shift our paradigm of perception and make us look anew at the way we observe the world around us?  Not many, I can assure you.Christopher Nolan's brilliant and audacious cinematic tour de force reawakens our faith in the medium and those who dare to challenge it.

Even though I have read Tolkien's books five times, and knew exactly what was going to happen, the movie had me on the edge of my seat with suspense.  Of course, some things were changed from Tolkien's novel.  The major changes that get complained about are the removal of Tom Bombadil and the insertion of Arwen.  These two modifications are really one in the same.  The filmmakers, despite the novelistic purists complaints made an excellent decision here.  Let's be realistic, the only reason Tom Bombadil is in the novel at all is to connect us all back to The Hobbit and Bilbo's story, so it works well in the story to establish that connection in the reader's mind.  However, it has no greater purpose in the story of The Lord of the Rings, and in the end is rather insignificant, even in the novel.  Now, perhaps if they had made four movies, starting with The Hobbit, the Tom Bombadil character should have been included.  In essence, what the filmmakers have done is to drop Tom Bombadil's screen time in favor of modifying and incorporating the Arwen character more.  Now, if anyone has read the entire three books,  they should have also read the touching appendix on Arwen and Aragorn.  Peter Jackson certainly has read this and decided to take slight interpretive liberties to expand the story of this appendix back into the main screenplay.  I see nothing wrong with this. Yes, the novel was modified - slightly.  Let's give credit where credit is due and congratulate Jackson for getting in 95% true to course.There have been some other complaints, such as seeing Gandalf's time in Isenguard while the Hobbits journey to Rivendell.  But this is simply to make this part of the story work cinematically - it would be a bad thing for the movie to have Gandalf arrive in Rivendell and drone on in flashback mode about what happened.  It is much better for the action and the pacing of the movie to show the audience what is happening, as it is happening, not where it is the novel.  And it does tell the story presented in the novel.There have also been complaints about lack of development for Merry, Pippin, Boromir, Legolas, and Gimli.  Give me a break, what do you want, a five-hour movie with endless character bios read in a droning voice over of some historical shots?  You've really got to remember that what we have here is one story in three parts.  In the novels Boromir is a significant character and the movie does a good job of fleshing him out in the time allowed. Legolas and Gimli are underdeveloped in this third of The Movie.  But even in the novels the first book is more about Frodo and Gandalf than anyone else.  I suspect and hope that, just as in the novels that Gimli and Legolas will have a more prominent role to plan in the second act out next Christmas.Let's give Peter Jackson credit - the casting is dead on for every character in this movie.  Even Boromir, who I had fears about, considering he is described by Tolkien in the books as someone of larger stature than Sean Bean can pull off.  However, Sean Bean takes on this role with good acting presence in his allowed screen time so well that Boromir does have the presence represented in the novel, if not physically, at least dramatically. Along with the casting all the roles are well played with no overacting whatsoever.Other complaints have been filed that the beginning drags a bit, but first time readers of the novel have also had the same complaint.  I know many people that tried to get through The Fellowship of the Ring more than once and put it down in frustration right before it starts getting really good. But, when the do pick it up again and get through the beginning they have all said it was well worth it.  So it is with the movie.  This is another reason why the exclusion of Tom Bombadil is a positive for the film version of the tale, add him back in and the beginning would begin to drag more than a little bit, detracting from the rest of the movie.Certain people have also complained about the fight scenes, that you cannot tell precisely what is happening and they are rather darting and frenzied. Well, this isn't The Matrix, where every detail is laid out and choreographed so slowly that you can distinguish every move.  Jackson makes the fight scenes darting and frenzied on purpose, because it puts you in the midst of the battle, closely identifying you with how the characters feel at that point in time, and adds significantly to the thrill and suspense. You begin to really feel like you are in the fight and not watching some fight\/dance on a movie screen.  By making this choice, Jackson draws you into the fights at a frenzied pace, and makes a three hour movie seem much much shorter.There are the little touches as well, such as with Legolas when he is walking so lightly due to his elven nature that he doesn't sink into the snow, while the others in the Fellowship have to plow through it.  Such attention to detail has made this movie an outright excellent film adaptation of one of the greatest stories of our time.  Let's face it; this is a more than adequate, no excellent, film based upon the greatest fiction novel of the 20th century, and the greatest fantasy novel of all time. For all you complainers, just remember Star Wars Episode I and remember that this movie could have sucked just as badly after all the hype too.  Thank God it didn't, it's an 11 on a scale of 1 to 10, and lived up to all the hype and more.  Go see this movie, I don't have to tell you to see it more than once, you'll do that all on your own.

Quite possibly the purest movie musical ever made, `Singin' In the Rain,' directed by Gene Kelly and Stanley Donen, has everything you could want in a musical  A good story, perfect cast, imaginative choreography, memorable music and songs, terrific performances, and a presentation that is nothing less than inspired.  It takes you behind the scenes of the movie business, set during the transitional period between the heyday of silent films and the advent of talkies.  Don Lockwood (Kelly) and Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen) are two of the biggest stars in Hollywood, the Tracy and Hepburn of Monumental Studios, which is about to release their latest movie-- a swashbuckling costume drama.  But a rival studio has just released `The Jazz Singer,' and overnight the industry is revolutionized, and silent films are just that quickly a thing of the past.  To keep up and stay afloat, the major studios need to produce pictures that talk.  And where does Monumental start?  By retooling their latest big star vehicle (with Lockwood and Lamont) into a MUSICAL swashbuckling costume drama.  If it's song and dance the public wants, then that's what they'll get-- right along with the drama of the costume and the swashbuckling thrown in to boot. There's one problem, though; the sound of Lina's voice has the effect of fingernails scraping a chalkboard, and her diction isn't going to land her the role of Juliet anytime soon.  The powers that be at Monumental fear they may soon have a `falling' star on their hands.  But there's always a solution, of course; and leave it to Don's partner, Cosmo (Donald O'Connor), to come up with it.  And it just happens to involve a young lady named Kathy (Debbie Reynolds), with whom Don has just recently become acquainted.  And that's where the story really begins.Kelly and Donen (who also teamed up for `On the Town' and `It's Always Fair Weather') certainly know how to put on a show.  The name of their game is Entertainment-- yes, with a capital `E'-- and that's exactly what you get. The dazzling production numbers are upbeat and electrifying  Donald O'Connor's `Make 'Em Laugh;' `Good Mornin',' which features Debbie Reynolds (joined by Kelly and O'Connor); a diction lesson by Kelly and O'Connor that begins with `Moses,' who `Supposes his 'toeses' are roses;' and a transporting routine with Kelly and Cyd Charisse.  But the highlight is Kelly doing the title song while `Singin' and dancin' in the rain.'  And these are but a few of the magical marvels of this film.When Kelly sings `Gotta dance!' you'd better believe it, because he's the best of the best, and he's at the top of his game here.  He's a consummate entertainer and a perfectionist, and simply a joy to watch.  And with O'Connor next to him you really have something special, as they tend to bring out the best in one another (I submit their `Moses' number as evidence).  Also, they seem to genuinely enjoy working together; there appears to be an almost fun sense of spirited competition going on as they dance, and it's an invigorating experience (if this wasn't so, then they've pulled off a marvelous bit of acting).  But no one can out-dance Gene Kelly. Period.  And he may not be the world's greatest singer, but in this film his voice is in top form, as well.Also a consummate performer, Donald O'Connor more than holds his own with Kelly on the dance floor (and he's at the top of a very short list of those who can), and the sense of humor and personality he brings to the film are invaluable.  His energetic `Make 'Em Laugh' number does just that; and while it's funny, it also showcases O'Connor's versatility and gives him a chance to display some amazing moves (how many people-- even professional dancers-- can dance up the side of a wall and into a back flip?).  And he makes it look so easy.  As Cosmo, he's the quintessential second banana and jack-of-all-trades.  He dances, sings, plays piano, cracks jokes, pops up for tech work in the sound booth, and on top of everything else he's an idea man and a general facilitator of anything and everything that needs facilitating.  If Danny Kaye had a brother it would be O'Connor; and-- like Kelly-- he's just a pleasure to watch.Debbie Reynolds was twenty-years-old when she made this film, and she's a perfect fit with Kelly and O'Connor.  Beautiful and talented-- and mature beyond her years-- she has a kind of sparkle all her own and a terrific screen presence.  She can sing and she can dance, she looks good no matter what she's doing, and there's a wholesome, girl-next-door quality about her that makes her endearing.  It also makes Kathy a very real and believable character, and Reynolds plays her perfectly.As Lina Lamont, the girl with a voice that could make cats cry, Jean Hagen is an absolute riot.  Reminiscent of a character Mia Farrow would create years later in `Radio Days,' Sally White-- though perhaps a bit more dense-- Lina takes the `vain' out of `vanity,' and Hagen brings her to life with a vivid, memorable performance.  And it's just another of the many elements that make this such a great film.The supporting cast includes Millard Mitchell (Simpson), Rita Moreno (Zelda), Douglas Fowley (Roscoe) and Kathleen Freeman (Phoebe).  If pure entertainment is what you're after, you need look no further than `Singin' In the Rain,' which successfully dispels any doubts that there is, indeed, magic in the movies.  Because this movie is magic, a sheer delight from beginning to end no matter how many times you see it.

I can also say that there was never a single moment that I thought about how long it was or what time it was or if it was almost over.However, I admit that I was close. I feel that they could easily have cut out 20 minutes and it would have been a better, tighter, more intense thriller. Also, I was turned off by Costner's poor attempt at a New England accent. Interestingly, it was much less obvious by the end of the film.But, it has one big advantage - the fact that it tells a true story. It is truly amazing how close we came. The fact that we can watch the story 40 years later with no fear of realizing the ramifications adds a unique level of interest and suspense. Overall, it was well worth the time.

","genre":"Drama, History, Thriller"},{"date":"31 December 2001","score":"","review":" I normally hate time-travel movies. They are usually very formulaic Put someone in the past\/future and then weave 2 hours of slapstick around not knowing how to drive a car or ballroom dance. If Meg Ryan wasn't starring in this I might not have bothered to see it.However, I was pleasantly surprised because this movie is more about romance than time-travel. Hugh Jackman plays the Duke of Albany Leopold, who inadvertently follows Stuart (Liev Schrieber) through a time-travel portal into the future. Here he meets Stuart's ex-girfriend Kate (Meg Ryan) and falls in love. Rather than resorting to watching Leopold bumble around the 21st century, the movie centers on Kate's distrust of men and Leopold's capabilities with them. Breckin Meyer plays Kate's brother Charlie and adds the humorous elements to the film. As we watch Kate and Leopold fall in love, the story does take a few twists and turns that kept me grinning. Hugh Jackman is just charming in this role and you can't help but fall in love with him as well (what's a few centuries difference, anyway?)Not much is spent on the technical aspects of time travel, and the few instances of learning to make a toilet flush or marveling over a toaster you see in the trailers is all you see. Leopold embraces the future with the same suave he does socially; so in that respect you canbelieve it when he runs the dishwasher with no difficulty. Like most Meg Ryan films, the ending is fairy tale enough to justify the silly plot. I enjoyed it very much.My biggest beef with this film was the blantant product placement! It was so bad I started counting and made it up to 10 major placements in the first 40 minutes. Note to Ms. Ryan Take a stand on this. Having your character dump a latte all over her white shirt only to have her coleague call up Barneys and order a Donna Karan shirt is beneath you now. I don't think Starbucks needs to pander to such antics. My other complaint is to the movie theatre that has the nerve to charge eight bucks for a matinee with a screen the size of a postage stamp and a sticky floor. When will this madness end?
