It woke me up from the first scene.  This was different. And it certainly was. And i mean that in the most complimentary way possible, for this film is not to missed.It starts with Donnie (Gyllenhaal) waking up in the middle of the road, his bicycle tossed to the side, with a complete confused and disorientated look on his face. He's been sleepwalking again. And so begins the rollercoaster of confusion, fear, love, hilariously dark humour, and sorrow. This movie truly does have everything, in all senses of the word. The camera work is innovative and mysterious, and it features some superb performances from Gyllenhaal, who simply IS Darko.A definite must-see, whoever you may be, refreshing and thought provoking, you will be amazed.
