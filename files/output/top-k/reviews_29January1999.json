It is such a well written piece that it keeps your attention the whole time.  The performances of Dustin Hoffman, Meryl Streep, and Jane Alexander are great.  A surprising standout in the film is Justin Henry in his Oscar nominated performance as the young son who is caught in the middle of his parent's divorce.
