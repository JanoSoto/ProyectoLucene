But I dont believe this.Can anyone tell me why this place Zion shouldnt be thought of as another fake? (a friend said see the next movie, but i hate answers like that). Think about it-- Supposedly no one knows what year it really is, but if Zion had been free ever since the war started, wouldnt EVERYONE there know exactly how long it had been since Zion became the last refuge?  IT has mainframe computers, so were not dealing with a purely oral history right?Two, if you think that the freed ones from the Matrix founded Zion, as Morpheus kinda indicated... HOW did they build a city so deep in the Earth? it would take considerable technology and effort to dig that far, and defend it in peacetime.. how could you do it, and keep the machines from searching for and destroying you?Second, The machines are able to jump into anyone still hardwired to the matrix.. which is why switch keeps the gun on neo in the car.. and why the old lady throws the knife at him near the end.. also, when SMITH takes over the bum in the trainstation, it shows that at least if they know where to look, the machines can be aware of whats going on.. yet when neo is freed, the machine just dumps his body after removing the connections... why didnt it snap his neck too.. the machines KNOW there are rebels... why let anyone join them.. much less someone the feared morpheus wanted to free...plus, they clearly knew where to find neo, because the tracer had been removed AFTER he got into the car when going to meet morpheus for the first time... so.. even after, they could still have used whatever power allowed them to sense the old ladies, and the bums awareness of neo at the end of the movie, to use neo to sense SWITCH, TRINITY etc. even if you argue the machines need to have an idea of where to look(which i think is CRAP too cuz of the bum), because the tracer proves they could have known where to find NEO. and therefore known he was waking to the truth as it were.my point is, that maybe the Matrix is a way JUST to pacify people, maybe the world is healed (or was never ruined in the first place) and the they are using the SUN as their input of energy.. thus thermodynamics isnt REALLY being violated..i came to this on my own, but im sure others have as well.. any serious problems with my reasoning? please explain if you find any... thank you  ","genre":null},{"date":"4 August 2003","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  Hello, I admit that i have just seen the Matrix for the first time, and have not yet seen Reloaded, but I intend to as soon as I think I understand a few things first.

This time, Joe, Michael Dudikoff is gone. Sean, whose karate fighter dad was killed in a robbery gone wrong, replaces him. Izumo raises him and teaches him the art of ninja. In comes Cobra a man who is manufacturing a virus to sell to terrorists. Also in the scam is general Andreas the man who shot Sean's father. In order to test the virus they organize a tournament to attract the best fighters of the world. Sean is then chosen as the best of the best and the virus tested on him. Not only that, his master Izumo is apparently also a prisoner of Cobra. So now, with the help of Curtis Jackson, Sean must avenge his father, save his master and get the antidote to survive this deadly virus.David Bradley is obviously far superior to Dudikoff when it comes to the physical aspect. This helps a lot in the action scenes, where Bradley shines and gives us a good show. He is also a better actor at least at the time even if he was still incredibly bad. Unfortunately he lacked the original american ninja's charisma. The movie suffers with that. Gary Conway who stared as The Lion on the 2nd part also writing it is again responsible for the script and the story is quite close the previous movie. Although stories don't really matter in these movies, I still got the feeling I was watching a worse remake of a bad film. Even the score is the same.  There's also not a real opponent to Sean so the final fight is against Cobra, and as could be imagined, it's a terrible scene. Quite simply the movie doesn't have a climax. There are a lot of action sequences, some very well made but Michele Chan is a failure, with no beauty, no acting skills and no martial arts ability. And since Bradley couldn't be in every scene its up to Steve James to again steal the show with his power and talent. Funny, cool, Steve James was the man. But the truth is Blood Hunt is a bad, almost boring film. It didn't catch my interest and I found it hard to keep watching it until the end.Not much fun im afraid. If not for the great Steve James it would have been a complete loss. Too bad.
