Delighting those who you love makes la vita bella, even in the hellish conditions.  This is the main idea of the whole film.I think director-writer-actor Roberto Benigni is a genius.  I think he deserved more Oscars!  Skilfully and successfully, he combines humor, wit, and love together to move everyone's hearts.The first half of the movie contrasts dramatically with the second half; the former tells the fairy tale of Guido from his courtship to Dora to building a happy and warm family, the latter tells the hellish holocaust in which Guido, who has become a slave under the brutal rule of the Nazi, uses humor to delight his beloved son in the most awful environment and to hide from him the awful truth.  It is the second half that makes all the audience impossible not to weep---Guido's good-intentioned lies (the game), the chances he grasps to communicate with his wife, for instance, the opera music he plays when he serves the German soldiers in the holocaust, the funny walk he does when arrested by a German soldier so as to delight his son even in his eleventh hour, and finally, his sacrifice.  I think all of these are unforgettable scenes in each audience's memory.Aside from love, other aspects that this movie will make you think about are, in my opinion, the meaning of life, slavery, and war.  The key to have a beautiful life is clearly portrayed by the Italian genius.  La Vita e Bella is a rare masterpiece in this epoque.

It was a nice variation of the what if... genre where Belushi's Larry is a middle-class guy living the Donald Trump life and all the craziness that goes with it.Ironically, Family Man starts off similarly to Destiny, the *event* in each character's life that changed their future forever.  It is 1987, and Nic Cage plays Jack Campbell, who has an enormous opportunity of a lifetime if he steps on a plane bound for London rather than stay and resume his relationship with his beautiful college sweetheart, Kate (appealingly played by Tea Leoni).  Jack takes the road less travelled and boards the plane.Thirteen years pass, and we see that Kate is no longer with Jack.  In fact, he has obviously succeeded immensely in the business world and can pick any beautiful woman that he wants.  Jack has all the material things any person desires *lots* of money, expensively tailored clothes, a huge penthouse with a Park Avenue view, a fast Italian sports car and people who both envy and follow him. Jack is a nice enough guy.  There is nothing inherently *bad* about him, but he is thoroughly obsessed with work.  He has his staff coming in on Christmas Eve rather than have the day off because of a billion-dollar merger happening the day after Christmas that Jack orchestrated.  Yet, he gets a curious telephone message from Kate, whom Jack never saw again after he boarded that plane in 1987.Though nostalgic about a past love, he doesn't call her back and decides to go about his life.  Later that night, he has a chance meeting in a convenience store with a man waving a gun.  Jack could have just let the events unfold in front of him, but he takes a risk and confronts the man, whom we later find out is named Cash (played by the underused Don Cheadle).  Jack even tries to help him by suggesting counseling or help groups, which makes Cash laugh, but Jack's kindness impresses him nevertheless.  Little do we know that Cash is going to do Jack a favor.Jack goes to bed that night none the wiser only to wake up the next morning in a different bed with Kate, his old college sweetheart, laying on him.  Now, Jack finds out how the other half lives and literally is lost and confused for a time.  Yet, even though he seems to be lost in suburbia hell, a subtle transformation takes place within Jack.  The cold, heartless overachiever that made Jack succeed so well in business becomes a loving, caring husband and father.  Though some of the movie appears hokey and somewhat contrived, the story never veers away from the concept of love and family.  True, Jack does not get to spend money on $2400 suits and expensive wines and dinners, but beyond all that, he realizes that he never truly got over Kate.  Even though it's been 13 years, he sees that she has blossomed into a truly beautiful woman that his friend, Arnie, says any man would give up his left nut to be with.  There are many funny moments of pure suburbia living that most people will identify with.  We see glimpses of what family man Jack, a good husband and father, was like through his friends and the birthday video where he sings to Kate that business man Jack sees and even cries over. I was impressed that Kate was willing to give up the life she had to let Jack pursue his dream of being a business success.  She truly loved him enough to allow something as that life-changing.  Realizing her feelings for him, Jack felt more lost without her when he was unceremoniously returned back to his real life.  Like Belushi's Larry in Mr. Destiny, Jack sees that his life is not truly complete unless he has someone special to share it with.I found myself smitten with the performances of most of the cast, particularly Cage and Leoni.  They have a dynamite chemistry that makes the story believable.  I have never been a big fan of Leoni, but her portrayal of Kate as a charming, sexy, loving, loyal and supportive wife makes her extremely appealing in this movie.  It's not difficult to see why Jack never got over his love for her after all those years.  The ending, appropriately at an airport, was very sweet and realistic.  We can only imagine what Kate thought about Jack's re-cap of the lives they never had.  Yet, it was enough to get her attention.  That last scene with them having coffee in an airport lounge with snow falling outside was just perfect.  Though I wish there wouldn't have been the predictablity of Jack's alternate life ending, he was brave enough to risk his career to get that small chance to have a life with Kate. This is a great feel-good movie not to be missed!

An entertaining film for when I was 13, let me tell you. Later that year, skipping through a paranormal book in the library, I found that there was truth behind the original story, of a house in Amityville supposedly `haunted' by demons and evil spirits.I decided to read Jay Ansons book. I was absolutely glued within its pages and couldn't stop reading. Never had I been so terrified in all my life. I thought it was absolutely shocking, that this story was believed in the first place. When you're that age you want to believe in the paranormal, and it made me convinced that evil forces were at work in that house because the owners fled within an inch of their lives. When I saw the film, it was a completely different affair. It lacks something, focussing on George and Kathy Lutz's relationship rather then the evil spirits. Who cares if the father starts to go crazy, we want to know what kind of evil forces lurk in the house! But this is supposed to be an account of a true story, you say. Well, the film seems entirely different to the book. Where did the bit where the priest become blind come from? Or where the claustrophobic baby-sitter enters the house and gets locked in the cupboard?I disliked the cast. James Brolin's beard looks atrocious, and you become more concerned for his shocking resemblance of a woodland creature then his character. The kids are boring, they didn't match the expectations of the book, especially `Missy'. I thought she was a very important character in the book because she brought in the `imaginary friend' theme, of Jodie the pig. Then in the book she talks of an imaginary friend telling her about the boy that used to live in the house who was shot. So the boy that was shot is one of the ghosts in the house? This is the sort of creepiness that made the book so wonderful. Here, Missy has the acting talent of a toilet seat.I know this review seems more-like a comparison between the book of the film, but the film could have been so much better. The book left things to your imagination. Here, those things that spun around in your head are brought to you on a plate, and become not half as satisfactory as you imagined them. Like for example, the well that was supposed to be the gateway to hell. The manhole cover in our back yard looks more terrifying. Or the `red room'. Come on, it's a storage area for tools that was painted red. And I don't want crude 2D floating images of George Lutz's face (even if they didn't have anything better in 1979). This film didn't need special effects, visual effects are more suitable and believable then computerised ones. Best scene in the film is where the medium discovers the well, and mutters something in a truly terrifying voice `This is the well&#133; It is the path&#133; to hell!' combined with the intense music, this will wipe the smile of anyone's face. The worst scene is the ending, where they just run out of the house with black slime oozing out of the walls. What's this now, the house wanted them to flee for their lives, why didn't it ooze black Toymaster gunge in the first place?Best book I have ever read. Once more, you can buy the book from a second hand store for as little as 35p. Now THAT's a bargain! As for the film, it's worth a look, but it's certainly no classic and deeply average.

An entertaining film for when I was 13, let me tell you. Later that year, skipping through a paranormal book in the library, I found that there was truth behind the original story, of a house in Amityville supposedly `haunted' by demons and evil spirits.I decided to read Jay Ansons book. I was absolutely glued within its pages and couldn't stop reading. Never had I been so terrified in all my life. I thought it was absolutely shocking, that this story was believed in the first place. When you're that age you want to believe in the paranormal, and it made me convinced that evil forces were at work in that house because the owners fled within an inch of their lives. When I saw the film, it was a completely different affair. It lacks something, focussing on George and Kathy Lutz's relationship rather then the evil spirits. Who cares if the father starts to go crazy, we want to know what kind of evil forces lurk in the house! But this is supposed to be an account of a true story, you say. Well, the film seems entirely different to the book. Where did the bit where the priest become blind come from? Or where the claustrophobic baby-sitter enters the house and gets locked in the cupboard?I disliked the cast. James Brolin's beard looks atrocious, and you become more concerned for his shocking resemblance of a woodland creature then his character. The kids are boring, they didn't match the expectations of the book, especially `Missy'. I thought she was a very important character in the book because she brought in the `imaginary friend' theme, of Jodie the pig. Then in the book she talks of an imaginary friend telling her about the boy that used to live in the house who was shot. So the boy that was shot is one of the ghosts in the house? This is the sort of creepiness that made the book so wonderful. Here, Missy has the acting talent of a toilet seat.I know this review seems more-like a comparison between the book of the film, but the film could have been so much better. The book left things to your imagination. Here, those things that spun around in your head are brought to you on a plate, and become not half as satisfactory as you imagined them. Like for example, the well that was supposed to be the gateway to hell. The manhole cover in our back yard looks more terrifying. Or the `red room'. Come on, it's a storage area for tools that was painted red. And I don't want crude 2D floating images of George Lutz's face (even if they didn't have anything better in 1979). This film didn't need special effects, visual effects are more suitable and believable then computerised ones.

Allegedly based on fact, we see 15 year old rock fan William Miller pass himself off as an older writer suitable for the country's premier rock journal, Rolling Stone, which was apparently run by morons, to send off to cover a 1973 U S  tour by a thinly disguised Led Zepplin (called Stillwater in the film). Well, Rolling Stone once sent the more than slightly crazed Hunter S Thompson to cover a presidential election, which he did with great distinction, so anything?s possible, but it's all a bit implausible, particularly as we are asked to believe that this kid, physically young for his years, not only gets past the security guard, but gets the popsters to spill their most intimate secrets, albeit with the help of a mid-west thunderstorm. The kid, clearly a talented lad (after all, he is Cameron Crowe, the director of this film), is mentored by an established writer with the ludicrous (but actual) name of Lester Bangs (Phillip Seymour Hoffman, who has all the most intelligent lines), gets deflowered by a bunch of groupies, falls in love with Penny Lane (played by Kate Hudson), the foxiest of them, and in the end manages to churn out a reasonable piece ('Stillwater runs deep').Unlike the sixties those of us who went through the seventies remember them all to well. The Lester character was quite right, Rock was through as a social force and the corporations had taken over. The false dawn of the Age of Aquarius, of love and peace, was over and things just got worse. By 1976 we had Punk, a sort of  final squeak from the great revolt which had so dismally failed. Still, here we are looking at Rock at the micro level, through a competent but not really great or original group going through their paces, drugs and groupies, some members handling it all better than others, but all of them being ripped off by promoters and record companies.William the Kid, played by Patrick Fugit, is very engaging, Frances McDormand is a nice overanxious mum and Billy Crudup as the Roberteque Plant character Russell is  intermittently effective, but the standout performance is Kate Hudson, daughter of Goldie Hawn. Very occasionally in Hollywood a star's son or daughter  turns out to have their own original talent, and Kate seems to be one of those. Her looks are very reminiscent of Goldie, but the performance is more measured, more low key, and very effective. It's not easy to give such a slight character ('Penny Lane' no less) emotional depth, but she does it very well.As for the rest, the soundtrack plunders the hits of  the early seventies so effectively the CD of the film will find a place in every rock historian's archive. We also get to see a lot of footy arenas, the favoured venue for 70's rock promoters because they could be hosed down when it was all over.

People are not used to Hollywood putting out a movie that reflects society and its various members' feelings, they are uncomfortable with that.  And they usually do a good job of stopping these kinds of films from being made.  They would rather a happy, repetitive and empty film than an honest one.  But there is a segment of the population that looks for the original and different film.This film is mocking society and it's pretty sad the length it has to go to do this.  Getting beaten to a pulp is the last resort to life that Jack sees in this early twenty-first century age.  Society says we should graduate from high school, go to college, get a well-paying job, get married, then have kids, but something seems to be missing to Jack while in the job stage of life, he is emotionally empty, numb and to top that off he has insomnia.  So to get some emotional feeling and contact and to possibly get some sleep, he attends support groups where each group has a different illness, which Jack has none of, but goes for a shot at life, an opportunity to live.  Now it is true that Jack isn't suffering with the various cancers within each group but nonetheless Jack is suffering.  Jack is suffering from insomnia, he's confused and he's unhappy.  So to treat these ailments he attends the support groups. So along with the other support group-goers Jack is attempting to heal a problem.  After a few months he sees a fellow tourist named Marla who goes to the support groups and also has none of the illnesses.  So now Jack is again unable to sleep, so he tells Marla his problem and from then on they agree to attend different support groups.Fight Club is great in so many ways.  For example this was one of the first movies to use photogrammetry, which is the shots you see going through the building floors then into the van with the bomb in it.  The cool sex scene in the movie is also done by the use of photogrammetry. Photogrammetry was also used for the footage of the apartment blowing up zooming into the stove and into the back of the refrigerator.  Fight Club definitely has the most original story of at least the past couple of years; the protagonist's real name is never given; that's different and interesting.  This movie challenges everything about current-day society whether it is corporate influence, or modern living, or being a sheep in a herd, or any of the other subjects that are addressed in the film.  This movie ends with a great song too, Where Is My Mind? by the Pixies, appropriate title too.  The intro into the film is amazing as well - the brain ride.  The music compliments the movie so well and fits in great with the whole modern-day age theme.For the people who are uncomfortable with Fight Club and people who find it offensive.  These people obviously have problems of their own that need to be addressed.  As Edward Norton said, Art reflects the flaws of society and if people are uncomfortable with this then they are the problem.  These people are perfectly comfortable with a movie like Saving Private Ryan that shows limbs flying off, faces ripped off, torsos blown off, etc. but they can't handle a fist to an eye. And it's a willing fist to an eye, both fighters realize they are going to get hit and they want that.  Whereas in Saving Private Ryan the people getting shot do not want to get hit, there is a difference.  It just shows the contradictory views that these conservatives hold, totally partial to one thing over another.  What decides what type of bloodshed is acceptable?  The answer is what the bloodshed is representing (what that particular movie is about).  In the case of Saving Private Ryan it was patriotic bloodshed, non-threatening bloodshed, acceptable bloodshed, but in Fight Club the bloodshed was part of a type of radicalism that was deemed a threat by the establishment whether it be Hollywood, the corporations, or the government.  That is where censorship comes in, the free flowing of ideas, which is completely necessary for a healthy democracy.  When censors start to flex their muscle that's when some form of communism or fascism makes its appearance.  With one critic calling Fight Club fascist, I say censoring an idea is fascist (an example most obvious in the case of Brazil where Terry Gilliam almost could not get the movie released).  If you don't like Fight Club or the ideas it presents then don't watch it, but don't decide for others if it is acceptable to watch or not.A few insights that I gained the car company that Jack worked for is Ford Motor Company.  This is shown in the scene when Jack beats himself up in front of his boss and they quickly show a glimpse of the letters FMC on his boss's business card, which would refer to Ford Motor Company.  Jack got over his TV addiction that he and so many Americans have.  This shows that to live you have to lose that addiction.  Upon reflecting, Tyler is so free in the ways that most (and almost all people) aren't.  Tyler doesn't have a car, doesn't have bills, doesn't have pointless possessions, he doesn't work everyday to pay for his new $25,000 car, he's free.  The rejection of material possessions is one important idea to take away from the film, if nothing else.

It just shows the contradictory views that these conservatives hold, totally partial to one thing over another.  What decides what type of bloodshed is acceptable?  The answer is what the bloodshed is representing (what that particular movie is about).  In the case of Saving Private Ryan it was patriotic bloodshed, non-threatening bloodshed, acceptable bloodshed, but in Fight Club the bloodshed was part of a type of radicalism that was deemed a threat by the establishment whether it be Hollywood, the corporations, or the government.  That is where censorship comes in, the free flowing of ideas, which is completely necessary for a healthy democracy.  When censors start to flex their muscle that's when some form of communism or fascism makes its appearance.  With one critic calling Fight Club fascist, I say censoring an idea is fascist (an example most obvious in the case of Brazil where Terry Gilliam almost could not get the movie released).  If you don't like Fight Club or the ideas it presents then don't watch it, but don't decide for others if it is acceptable to watch or not.A few insights that I gained the car company that Jack worked for is Ford Motor Company.  This is shown in the scene when Jack beats himself up in front of his boss and they quickly show a glimpse of the letters FMC on his boss's business card, which would refer to Ford Motor Company.  Jack got over his TV addiction that he and so many Americans have.  This shows that to live you have to lose that addiction.  Upon reflecting, Tyler is so free in the ways that most (and almost all people) aren't.  Tyler doesn't have a car, doesn't have bills, doesn't have pointless possessions, he doesn't work everyday to pay for his new $25,000 car, he's free.  The rejection of material possessions is one important idea to take away from the film, if nothing else.  ","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"11 March 2001","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  Violence?  Essentially none compared to Saving Private Ryan, Gladiator and many other recent films.  Critics see an opportunity to jump all over this movie for its violence when in fact it is it's various themes, which threaten the establishment, that are the problem to them.  People are not used to Hollywood putting out a movie that reflects society and its various members' feelings, they are uncomfortable with that.  And they usually do a good job of stopping these kinds of films from being made.  They would rather a happy, repetitive and empty film than an honest one.  But there is a segment of the population that looks for the original and different film.This film is mocking society and it's pretty sad the length it has to go to do this.  Getting beaten to a pulp is the last resort to life that Jack sees in this early twenty-first century age.  Society says we should graduate from high school, go to college, get a well-paying job, get married, then have kids, but something seems to be missing to Jack while in the job stage of life, he is emotionally empty, numb and to top that off he has insomnia.  So to get some emotional feeling and contact and to possibly get some sleep, he attends support groups where each group has a different illness, which Jack has none of, but goes for a shot at life, an opportunity to live.  Now it is true that Jack isn't suffering with the various cancers within each group but nonetheless Jack is suffering.  Jack is suffering from insomnia, he's confused and he's unhappy.  So to treat these ailments he attends the support groups. So along with the other support group-goers Jack is attempting to heal a problem.  After a few months he sees a fellow tourist named Marla who goes to the support groups and also has none of the illnesses.  So now Jack is again unable to sleep, so he tells Marla his problem and from then on they agree to attend different support groups.Fight Club is great in so many ways.  For example this was one of the first movies to use photogrammetry, which is the shots you see going through the building floors then into the van with the bomb in it.  The cool sex scene in the movie is also done by the use of photogrammetry. Photogrammetry was also used for the footage of the apartment blowing up zooming into the stove and into the back of the refrigerator.  Fight Club definitely has the most original story of at least the past couple of years; the protagonist's real name is never given; that's different and interesting.  This movie challenges everything about current-day society whether it is corporate influence, or modern living, or being a sheep in a herd, or any of the other subjects that are addressed in the film.  This movie ends with a great song too, Where Is My Mind? by the Pixies, appropriate title too.  The intro into the film is amazing as well - the brain ride.  The music compliments the movie so well and fits in great with the whole modern-day age theme.For the people who are uncomfortable with Fight Club and people who find it offensive.  These people obviously have problems of their own that need to be addressed.  As Edward Norton said, Art reflects the flaws of society and if people are uncomfortable with this then they are the problem.  These people are perfectly comfortable with a movie like Saving Private Ryan that shows limbs flying off, faces ripped off, torsos blown off, etc. but they can't handle a fist to an eye. And it's a willing fist to an eye, both fighters realize they are going to get hit and they want that.  Whereas in Saving Private Ryan the people getting shot do not want to get hit, there is a difference.  It just shows the contradictory views that these conservatives hold, totally partial to one thing over another.  What decides what type of bloodshed is acceptable?

Diane Lane stars as Pearl Kantrowitz, a thirty-one year old mother of two, the oldest of whom, Alison (Anna Paquin), is fourteen; her husband, Marty (Liev Schreiber), is a square shooter who loves his wife and family and provides for them by working long hours in a shop repairing television sets.  It's the summer of &#145;69, and while on the family's extended vacation-- during which Marty must return to work for the week-- Pearl falls into discontent, and with Woodstock about to happen a mere stone's throw from the campground\/resort at which they are staying, she soon succumbs to the siren's song of the &#145;60s  The inhibition, freedom and free love-- all of which have been denied her since giving birth to her daughter at age seventeen. \tThere's an honesty to Goldwyn's film, and though he captures the sense of the times in which the story is set fairly well, he nevertheless fails to elicit much sympathy for his leading lady, Lane.  Perhaps it's because, though there is much about Pearl with which to identify, her story is just too familiar; her situation is far from being unique, and she has a decent, upper middle-class life, with a loving husband and two great kids.  The fact that she started young and that her dreams were never realized is a shame, but it's not like she's the only one to whom such a fate has befallen.  And her futile attempt at regaining her lost years comes across as somewhat shallow and decidedly unsympathetic; and without that sympathy the film sputters and finally stalls, even as Neil Armstrong is beginning his historic walk on the Moon. \tThere's no question that Lane is attractive, and physically she fits the role of Pearl perfectly.  But she simply doesn't possess the wherewithal to sell her character in this film.  The emotional turmoil of what Pearl is experiencing seems restricted to the surface, and she never manages that depth of feeling that would've made the necessary connection with the audience.  It's not that Lane is bad in this role, it's just that she's not that good.  There are just too many gaps in credibility and too many false moments to be overlooked.  It's as if the character throughout remained just beyond her grasp.  Liev Schreiber, on the other hand, is outstanding as Marty.  You have no trouble believing he is exactly who and what he is supposed to be.  This is a character to whom most people will be able to relate, and if only Lane had been able to evoke the same kind or response as Schreiber, it would've made a tremendous difference in the overall aspect of the film.  Anna Paquin gives a noteworthy performance as well, successfully capturing the angst of puberty while coping with an ever-changing world. \tThe supporting cast includes Viggo Mortensen as Walker Jerome, the traveling salesman with whom Pearl attempts to reconcile her lost youth; Tovah Feldshuh (Lilian Kantrowitz); Bobby Boriello (Daniel); Stewart Bick (Neil); Jess Platt (Herb); Star Jasper (Rhoda) and Julie Kavner (Voice of the Social Director).  There are some poignant moments in Goldwyn's film, and it does generate a certain sense of loss and longing;  but overall, `A Walk On the Moon' is at best a momentary diversion that comes across like a finger painting on an impressionist's canvas.  That is stays afloat at all is due mainly to Schreiber and Paquin's performances.

I think that the weaknesses of Priest lay in the subplots.  I was very disappointed in Father Matthew for his sexual relationship with the housekeeper and his unrepentant attitude.  Regardless of whether priests should be allowed to marry, Father Matthew took a vow not to get sexually involved with someone so that he can devote himself more fully to his parish.  I think his marital-style relationship was a betrayal of the trust that his parish placed in him.  I also wasn't keen on Father Matthew's vulgar language during one of his sermons.  While I appreciated the sentiment, I probably would have walked out, too.  I very much liked Father Matthew, however, and his supportive relationship with Father Greg.  The subplot with the incestual molestation added some great drama, but the dilemma about the confidentiality of confession borders on trite.  Priest movies are almost as certain to include this story-line as submarine movies are to include that slow, terrifyingly tense descent below the maximum depth for which the sub was designed.What I love about this movie is that it really isn't about whether homosexuality is OK.  Father Greg never attempts to defend his fling with Graham.  He acknowledges that it was a mistake and even asks for the parish's forgiveness.  I think the movie is a story of human xenophobia, people's paranoid reaction to something they don't or can't fully understand.  I think it's about the parish's venomous lashing out against Father Greg when they would have been much more understanding had he slept with a woman.  He'd be breaking the same vow either way, but if he breaks it in a way that someone else can't relate to or understand, then just cancel Christmas.I live in a very conservative college town whose students threw a fit when the the university's film club held screenings of this movie on campus.  I wish I had seen it back then.  I wish more people from this town had seen it.  The film doesn't argue for or against homosexuality.  I think you can watch this film without having your stance on the issue challenged.  The film is about people's failure, specifically Christian people's failure, to react in a way that is responsible and caring and forgiving toward a neighbor who makes a mistake that they may not be able to fully understand.

Not a new question, certainly, but in light of all the `reality' television shows currently in vogue, `15 Minutes,' written and directed by John Herzfeld, is a timely and pertinent examination of just how much is enough, and how far you really have to go to satisfy a public with an apparently insatiable appetite for violence.  Then again, is this really what people want to see, or is it a matter of unscrupulous network executives purposely feeding the curiosity of the masses and justifying their actions with ratings numbers?  In the 1976 film, `Network,' a programmer negotiates with terrorists to give them their own show; in this movie, the host of a tabloid news program is willing to broadcast live footage of the most repugnant murder and mayhem, claiming it is his `responsibility' to show it because it is `news.' \tThe story centers on veteran New York City detective Eddie Flemming (Robert De Niro), who enjoys a certain celebrity due to the fact that many of his cases have been featured on `Top Story,' the `news' show hosted by Robert Hawkins (Kelsey Grammer).  Flemming's notoriety actually facilitates his job to a certain extent, as people open up to him because they know him, or `of' him, at any rate.  But when a pair of criminals-- one a Czech, the other a Russian-- arrive in New York to settle a score after having just been released from prison in their own country, Flemming finds himself involved in a case more bizarre than any he's ever encountered.  For after noting the `success' of a murderer featured on Top Story, the two decide upon a career path for themselves; one that will lead them to fame and fortune.  And their plan is very simple  They will film their crimes and sell the tapes to the station or show that will pay the most-- and they intend on giving Mr. Robert Hawkins first crack at them. \tFor the audience, it becomes quite a wild ride, and Herzfeld delivers it all with heart-pounding, adrenaline pumping action, enhanced by a driving soundtrack that keeps you on edge right up to the end.  There's a relentless intensity to this film that never wavers, and there's just enough character development to keep it interesting, along with a couple of plot twists that are so unexpected it is almost unnerving.  Suffice to say, this is not your usual formulaic action\/crime drama. \tAs always, De Niro, the consummate professional, turns in the kind of performance we've come to expect from him.  He pursues his craft with such finesse and skill that very quickly you know who Flemming is and what he's all about.  Few actors have the ability to so succinctly convey character definition as De Niro does here, and it goes a long way to making this so much more than just an average cop show.  Edward Burns gives a notable performance as well, as Jordy Warsaw, the arson investigator for the Fire Department who teams up with Flemming in pursuit of these psychotic killers who have apparently come to regard violence as an acceptable way of life.  Burns works well with De Niro, and most importantly, he makes his character believable. \tThe supporting cast includes Vera Farmiga (Daphne), Melina Kanakaredes (Nicolette), Tygh Runyan (Stephen Geller), Sebastian Roche (Ludwig) and Karel Roden and Oleg Taktarov as the killers.  There is such high tension in this film-- the scenes involving the killers are especially frantic, and some of the violence is extremely graphic-- and there is such a pounding rhythm to it that it negates the emotional involvement of the audience to some extent, and at least one element of the plot is so shocking it may leave you nonplused; but in the final analysis, `15 Minutes' is an absorbing, action packed drama that is something of an indictment of the purveyors of sensationalism for it's own sake, as well as those who allow it to proliferate through irresponsible acquiescence.  Not for the faint of heart, but for those who like it served up hard, this will be a satisfying movie-going experience; and one that will stay with you for some time to come.

He hasn't done as much high profile stuff since-but with 'Count of Monte Cristo' and 'Time Machine' coming up, maybe that will change.You can't fault the cast or acting here-David Straithairn as Hugh Hefner(more or less-does he remind anyone else of Bill Bixby? does me), Basinger and Stretch Armstrong esp. At times it's hard to follow some of the plot-twists-esp. connecting the movements of the black suspects to everything else-but it does fit if you just let the film happen. I did of course like Kevin Spacey's unusual casting as a macho, on the take cop\/Dragnet consultant-he almost pulls it off too! He of course is incapable of a bad performance.Certainly the final shootout is a little Die-Hardish for a pic that is trying to remain 'real', but I liked it anyways. I wonder how much of this is based on actual historical events too.As for Basinger's Oscar, I don't see it-sure she was fine here, but-it's kinda like Sharon Stone's nomination for Casino. Soap opera moments and decent performing does not greatness make. Oh well.I donno how to rate this vs. Titanic, save that Big Sinking Boat does stick in the memory somewhat more, while the acting in LA Confidential is a cut above. I don't blame them for giving Big Sinking Boat the prize.***1\/2 outta ****, def. one of the better ones of the last decade. ","genre":"Crime, Drama, Mystery"}]
