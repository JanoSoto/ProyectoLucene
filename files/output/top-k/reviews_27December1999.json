His biting, often strange humor infuriated people to the point of hating him.  Those who got the joke saw through it all and chuckled at how the butt of his antics (the audience) became annoyed and distraught .  Ultimately and sadly, the joke was on Kaufman himself.  MAN ON THE MOON arrives at this conclusion after a series of episodic Andy moments, most of which fans have seen over and over again throughout the years.You sure wish you could get to know this flawed man and what made his outlandish mind work.  As David Letterman once said, sometimes, you look at Andy, and you are not sure who is behind the wheel.  You never do get a real sense of who he was in Milos Forman's strong, but nearsighted film.There are fabulous moments sprinkled throughout, however.  The first 5 minutes of the picture may have some of those same Andy haters leaving the theater, a further testament to his misunderstood humor.  Forman and his screenwriters have created a brilliant and ingenious method of beginning a Kaufman biopic.  Jim Carrey plays the erratic comedian masterfully in what is by far his best performance to date.  There are times when we see Carrey playing him as a goof off-stage, lying, demanding, and acting just flat out bizarre.  I ask myself whether or not this is the real thing.  Certainly, the many people involved in the production of the film (in particular Bob Zmuda and Danny DeVito) knew Kaufman well as a pro and a friend, but the joke may still be on us as far as finding out what he was really all about.Forman's direction and the screenplay basically play off the hopes that most audiences will be unfamiliar with Kaufman's work.  This is fine, however, there are times when a true fan can mimic what is happening on screen.  MAN ON THE MOON is merely a succession of scenes showcasing his talent, or lack of, leading to a mildly emotional climax.The question of whether or not Kaufman faked his own death is not really touched upon, but some subtle glimpses at film's end could keep you guessing.  R.E.M.'s classic tune fittingly ends what turns out to be a loving tribute to the guy.  Andy's antics did p*** a lot of people off. The film shows how he was able to create the illusion of what could be authentically unbelievable.  Were the wrestling injuries real?  Did Jerry Lawler really slap him on Letterman?  This is mostly left to your imagination for some time, but it is amusing to see who was in on some of the madness with him.The sickly humor of the piggish lounge singer Tony Clifton creates some huge laughs.  Clifton was Zmuda and Kaufman's favorite creation.  I think Forman and company with the help of Andy's pals use the Clifton character, who was the alter ego of Kaufman you could say, to show the tragedy of his comedy and his untimely death.  Clifton was the ultimate Kaufman fake-out, but he was able to live on while Andy was only mortal.What a curious man he was and who better than Carrey to play him (I mean really, WHO better).  His performance is the glue that holds MAN ON THE MOON together, barely.

It is a peculiar film, to say the least, and it is unique in that it is a comedy with a sad ending, even though it is not really a comedy.  (American Beauty is a similar film in that it is a tragedy with a happy ending, even though it is arguably not really a tragedy.)I should say first that Man on the Moon will doubtlessly receive a great deal of critical praise, and the main reason will be Jim Carrey's performance.  As a sort of a low-level movie buff, I can honestly say that I've seen a lot of movies, as well as a lot of great performances.  I do not think it at all presumptuous to say that Jim Carrey's performance as Andy Kaufman is not only the best performance of this year, but one of the best of any year.  I never thought I'd be able to say this, but I think Jim Carrey is one of the finest actors working today, as well as one of the most courageous.  Sure, Ace Ventura may not have come even close to making the A.F.I. list, but Carrey has grown and matured.  The first sign of this was with The Truman Show, a fantastic film which set a precedent for Jim Carrey performances yet to come, and Man on the Moon is certainly up to the standard.  Carrey deserves an Oscar for this role.  As a comic figure he will probably not get it.  The Academy never has taken comedians serious enough, so why should they start now?  In summation, it is unfair to say that Jim Carrey plays Andy Kaufman, because the performance is seamless.  Rather, Jim Carrey IS Andy Kaufman.  Despite Carrey's immensely recognizable face, one forgets that it isn't Kaufman himself on the screen.  Perhaps the most amazing thing about Carrey's performance is that we still do not understand Andy Kaufman after seeing it.  If any other actor would have played Kaufman, they would have put their own unique stamp on him, making the audience think they understood Kaufman but in reality only understanding one actor's interpretation of Kaufman.  Here, Carrey steps into Kaufman's shoes and changes nothing.  In other words Jim Carrey is Andy Kaufman, not Jim Carrey's version of Andy Kaufman.Enough about Carrey's performance.  On to the actual film.  A fan of much of Milos Forman's earlier work (particularly Amadeus), I was immensely disappointed with Man on the Moon.  The overall quality of the film is jaunty, disjointed, and rather nonsensical.  Perhaps Forman's real flaw is that he realizes that Andy Kaufman is an unusual character and jumps to the conclusion that a film about him must be unusual as well.  The result is a mass of characters whose motivations and thoughts make no sense to us and a film that is flawed at best.  We should not understand Kaufman, but we should understand (mostly) everybody else, and this simply doesn't happen.In a nutshell, Man on the Moon is a half-rate film which benefits immensely from a phenomenal performance by Jim Carrey.  My rating of this film is very high, I know, but this is largely due to Carrey.  If anybody else had played Kaufman I probably would have given the film closer to two stars.***1\/2 out of ****.

The comedy is all over the map. It is silly and gross but also touching. On top of this, is a great performance by Eddie Murphy who is able to create 7 characters. The pace of the film felt right. Murphy's professor begins as somewhat dull and a little depressed. This bit of seriousness and the university setting in a few minutes builds a solid story. Because of this, the script can bring in pretty wild comedy without seeming too overdone. The special effects and dream sequences help make the Jekyll and Hyde story more believable and interesting. But even better is the terrific makeup which is so good that we forget that half of the cast is being played by Eddie Murphy. What I liked the most was that I really began to care about the professor, especially when he is cruelly insulted by a nightclub comic. The Nutty Professor is not a masterpiece. Sometimes Murphy's Buddy Love gets too obnoxious and the gross humor gets a little stale. But the film had a tough hurdle to get over, trying to improve on a mediocre Jerry Lewis film. Considering this, I am amazed at how good this movie is.

They say there is no story, but thats not true, the story is really complex (in fact, too complex). Or that sound can't be heard in space - haha, funny, why does nobody care about that in movies such as Star Wars ?My own main problem with the movie are those parts which doesn't get explained; for example, what happened with the commander after he get wounded ? Suddenly he's just gone, and never appears again. Or why didn't they tried to save the fighter pilot who had crashed on the gangway ?!?!?And the fights itself as well as some of the starships looked too much just like those in the game, that could have been far cooler. On the other hand, the Kilrati - didn't they looked like lions in the original, much bigger than human beings ? Here they are black and are just same size, and they look more like rats.I somehow missed Rachael Leigh Cook in this one. Freddie Prinze Jr. played again the Prince Charming, but he had no real counterpart like in She's all that. Saffron Burrows is really good looking, but simply too old for taking Raechael's part.

So now that both the sound and the fury of marketing have died down, I'll speak my peace.Of course it's hard to look at this film in the final analysis because the entire cycle hasn't been completed yet, but to me the film feels like an overture of sorts, where the orchestra strikes up a loud and bombastic fanfare so that you know what's in store for the rest of the show, and so you feel good that you spent so much money to get in.With my lame simile out of the way, I'll deal with the two major problems other people seem to have had with the movie.#1 The Acting. Yeah, it does feel kind of stiff; but Lucas has always been a much better director of ideas than of people. Although the mannered feel of the dialogue really did hurt the story in a few parts (Any scene with Annikin), I was able to overlook it.#2 Jar Jar. I agree. He's lame. Although I did chuckle when Que-Gon grabs his tounge at the dinner table. And I do have to admit that I'll give Lucas credit for having guts if he decides to bring the character back.So what did I like about it? Well, it was just fun. Now I know that special effects alone can't make a movie good (Armegeddon and Starship Troopers come to my mind), but the breathtaking special effects used here work because they are used in tandem with a rich tapesty of mythology that Lucas has constructed.By the way, if anyone knows what the heck I meant by that, please let me know.Other parts I enjoyed#1 All the robots.#2 The political double dealing (There was just enough of this for nice flavoring, but not enough to clog up the works)#3 Queen Amidala. Already my favorite character, although I don't know why. I thinks it's because she seems so sad, especially during the confrontation with the senate. She's cute as a button, too.#4 That three-way lightsaber fight. Man, I could watch two whole hours of that.About a month after this was released, I felt kind of lousy because I felt that it was going to be regarded as a failure. But after looking at some recent reviews, I see that maybe viewers will be able to overlook the insurmountable expectations this had to live up to, and just enjoy it as the fun space trip it is.I haven't come close to saying what I really wanted to say about the film, but this will do, I guess.

While O'Donnell and Akroyd were fun to watch, that whole added on plot was terrible!  Why move the focus off Lisa and Elliot's relationship?
