Spectacular scenery, great and believable acting, filming better than in any other movie, and the greatest story ever told. Could you wish for more? Well, more is on the way.There are no high-speed car-chases here, there is no Tom Bombadil, no naked women, the songs from the book have been left out almost entirely, and the main character is a ring. A lot of things to p*** off almost everyone who are either fans of Tolkien or fans of Hollywood-blockbusters. I am both, and I'm still immensely pleased. I have read the books by Tolkien, and I have seen most of Peter Jacksons movies. Some say it can't compete with Star Wars... Of course it can't compete. Can the Godfather compete with Police Academy?

The Fellowship of The Ring is a huge, epic movie, almost flawlessly done, depicting the evil and horror that could lead Middle-Earth to its destruction.

Forget all other movies, this one is beyond comparison. Forget the regular 90 minute timeframe, forget the stereotypes, you have to dig a little deeper. What will you find? Solid gold. Pure and simple. And when all three movies are out, I hope they give us moviegoers an opportunity to see them all in a row, as they were meant to be. It's a ten out of ten, expect nothing else.

I popped it in the VCR and really wasn't expecting much.  I didn't really care to see a story about some mentally retarded, backwoods hick who had been in lock-up most of his life for butchering his mother.  It just didn't sound too enchanting.  (give me a break, I was 17)Anyway, by the time Carl was halfway into giving his monologue to a wide-eyed reporter, I was too absorbed to go to the bathroom.

I was laughing and crying at the same time and when the whole thing was said and done, I just wanted to find a way to call up Billy Bob Thornton and thank him.

In short, I haven't been the same since.This is the only movie (with the exception of Fight Club) that I have ever watched all the way through, rewound it, and watched it again the same night.

But there are other parts which are dreadful, and elements which make absolutely no sense, and the evolution of the story (so to speak) is miserable.  Christopher Walken plays Gabriel with a kind of sinister grace that is perfect for the role, after all this is an angel that resents God for giving humans souls and favoring them over his kind.  Put be plainly, right near the beginning, explicitly rejects Lucifer's route, something along the lines of We don't want to be God, we want it to be like it was.  The way Walken hunches over in places, squatting like a gargoyle on a medieval cathedral is interesting in and of itself.  What the second war in heaven really is all about, and how it is waged, and why God doesn't do anything about it, is left largely unexplained, but they give enough info to make the general plot line entertaining.  Virginia Madsen as a teacher who's student is used as a vehicle for an evil soul, the one that will tip the balance in the war, is the weakest of the cast.  She's not given much to do, and nothing much to say.  The best parts of this movie are such things as when Lucifer explains his position in the whole situation, a reasonably complex one as well.  The worst parts are things like the obvious plot hole that allows Christopher Walken to immediately render humans unconscious or dead just by waving his hand, but then he's not able to do the same to the hero of the movie at certain times--just not very well explained why he's allowing the failed priest\/homocide detective get away half what allows.  Some might view the movie as offensive, though I really don't know why; the closest thing to a real attack is when Gabriel says to the cop something like And you were raised Catholic, you should be on MY side.  Apart from that, the essence of the movie comes more one line that comes near the end where the same homocide cop says to Lucifer I have my soul, and my faith, what do you have?  Or when Lucifer expalins that hell is not the presence of burning oil or streams of ice, but rather an absence of God's grace.  Actually some very interesting takes on God and religion.

They hit the quality bell curve somewhere in the middle--solid two star movies.  Prophecy is entirely different--it achieves both very good and very bad--long stretches of the movie really are outstanding, especially Viggo Mortensen and, of course, Christopher Walken.  But there are other parts which are dreadful, and elements which make absolutely no sense, and the evolution of the story (so to speak) is miserable.  Christopher Walken plays Gabriel with a kind of sinister grace that is perfect for the role, after all this is an angel that resents God for giving humans souls and favoring them over his kind.  Put be plainly, right near the beginning, explicitly rejects Lucifer's route, something along the lines of We don't want to be God, we want it to be like it was.  The way Walken hunches over in places, squatting like a gargoyle on a medieval cathedral is interesting in and of itself.  What the second war in heaven really is all about, and how it is waged, and why God doesn't do anything about it, is left largely unexplained, but they give enough info to make the general plot line entertaining.  Virginia Madsen as a teacher who's student is used as a vehicle for an evil soul, the one that will tip the balance in the war, is the weakest of the cast.  She's not given much to do, and nothing much to say.  The best parts of this movie are such things as when Lucifer explains his position in the whole situation, a reasonably complex one as well.  The worst parts are things like the obvious plot hole that allows Christopher Walken to immediately render humans unconscious or dead just by waving his hand, but then he's not able to do the same to the hero of the movie at certain times--just not very well explained why he's allowing the failed priest\/homocide detective get away half what allows.  Some might view the movie as offensive, though I really don't know why; the closest thing to a real attack is when Gabriel says to the cop something like And you were raised Catholic, you should be on MY side.  Apart from that, the essence of the movie comes more one line that comes near the end where the same homocide cop says to Lucifer I have my soul, and my faith, what do you have?  Or when Lucifer expalins that hell is not the presence of burning oil or streams of ice, but rather an absence of God's grace.  Actually some very interesting takes on God and religion. It's just too bad that it's matched with such a botched ending, and such awful hackneyed elements like mystic Indian ceremonies and the forced love interest.  It seems to be a relatively low budget affair, and one seriously in need of re-editing.  Still well worth a look.

However, this film turned out to be a pleasant departure from the perky candy coated parts Dunst has played in the past.  In fact, this might be a watershed role for her, marking her transition from teen roles to adult roles.Dunst plays Nicole Oakley, a troubled teenager from a privileged family who falls in love with Carlos (Jay Hernandez), a boy from the wrong side of the tracks.  The story is nothing new, but the presentation is remarkably good, with far greater maturity than one would expect from a high school flick.This film is exceptional considering its limited budget and the fact that most of the major players have very little experience at this level.  For writers Phil Hay and Matt Manfredi, this is their first feature film screenplay.  For director John Stockwell, it is only his second feature film.  Likewise for Jay Hernandez and Taryn Manning.  Many of the Latino actors were cast from a local high school, so they are in their first film.  By comparison, Kirsten Dunst is a jaded veteran.  The use of so many ordinary (not professional actors) high school students in the film gives it a very genuine look and feel.  Stockwell turns in an impressive directorial effort with a story that is much more complex than it seems at first blush.  It starts out as your standard boy-meets-girl love story.  They flirt, act silly, have sex, fall in love and create beautiful romantic images on the beach.  Just when you think it is going to be a real yawner, things begin to get complicated.  Stockwell slowly peels away the layers of the two main characters and their families to reveal subterranean shearing forces that will act to tear them apart.  Nicole, who at first seems to be just a wild, rebellious brat, turns out to be far deeper and more emotionally unsettled than one would ever imagine.  Carlos' humble roots and burning ambition bring the relationship to a breaking point when he has to decide between Nicole and his shot at Annapolis.  Stockwell takes what could have been a trite teen romance and turns it into an engaging character study.  While his pace is perhaps a bit too deliberate and inclusive, his sensitive treatment of the motivation of the characters and his style of unraveling their psyches slowly before our eyes makes for great drama.  This film is full of `ahah' moments, where you find yourself re-evaluating the characters as some new piece of information is revealed.Kirsten Dunst has had an active career, appearing in over twenty films before the age of twenty (which age she will attain in April 2002).  This is by far her best performance, helped by the fact that it is the most complex character she has ever played.  There was a hint that her ability extended beyond the superficial teen characters she normally plays in the film `Virgin Suicides', where she played a sullen, bad girl with some serious problems.  As Nicole in this film, she shows us that she has extraordinary range.  She really cuts loose with the character, taking her to exhilarating and uninhibited highs as well as crashing, depression ridden lows.  Though this is a minor film from a box office perspective, this performance should get the attention of casting directors and open the door for her to get bigger, more serious parts.  Jay Hernandez shows promise, although he seems a little wooden in this film.  His great strength (other than his obvious good looks) is his sincerity.  He comes across as if he means every word he says.  I was going crazy trying to figure out where I had seen Bruce Davidson (who played Tom Oakley) before.  He played Willard in the film of the same name (1971) about a sociopathic kid who befriended rats and used them to attack his enemies.  Davidson gives a good performance here as Nicole's congressman father, particularly in the touching scene at the end.Herman Osario, Miguel Castro and Tommy De La Cruz were all cast for their first film in open auditions from thousands of Latino high school students.  They provide the film with some of its lighter moments as Carlos' friends, and they all give fantastic performances, basically being themselves.  Taryn Manning rounds out the cast as Nicole's best friend and does a fine job of playing the wild thing.I liked this film more for the drama than the romance.  I rated it an 8\/10.  Kirsten Dunst takes a quantum leap with this performance.  It is not for impatient viewers or those who despise slushy romances.

So, alas, the great subject matter has been neglected.  What results is not-a-bad movie about a fascinating woman that with a bit more research, better script, and a different leading lady could have been excellent, really excellent film.

From the very first time I heard of it, I had no interest to EVER see this film. After I came across a very positive review by a critic I enjoy very much, I thought to myself, well, why not. I'll go and see this movie. Now, to be honest, in the first 20-30 minutes of the film it has a nice fairly-tale quality to it. I liked the production designs and the costumes and the art direction all of that stuff! It was a film where you can tell took a lot of time and craft to finish. And, if you have any appreciation for films, you would have taken noticed to that. But, for me, the charm wears off! When you have a movie that is 47 hours long, no story can sustain that time frame. The story to this film is not strong enough to go on so long. As I sat in the theatre I kept asking, 'Why can't the movie end now?'. Certain books make wonderful films. Alexandre Dumas' The Three Musketeer's is one of those kinds of books. James' The Portrait of a Lady, and Jules Verne's Around the World in 80 Days & 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea. These books work in a visual medium. But for some reason, I don't think this book works in this medium. I've never read this book before, and I plan on keeping it that way, but, I'm sure if I did read it, it might be an exciting book. Full of suspense of action. And my mind would go to work on how everything must look. And might of taken me to a new world, as the best books do. But, this book, just doesn't work! I know many will disagree, saying it's full of life, and charm. But I sat in that theatre bored half way - no - completely OUT OF MY MIND! I couldn't take it anymore. I honestly don't mind a long movie. I've seen my share. The Godfather, Gone With The Wind, Bernardo Bertolucci's 1900 (which is actually longer than this film. That movie is 4 hours long.) and Theo Angelopoulos' Ulysses' Gaze. And I enjoyed them all. Because they all had a story! A story in which we felt for the characters, we went along with them enjoying the experience. Lord of the Rings did not affect me in this way.  The acting in the film is good. I liked Ian McKellan as Gandalf, I also liked Ian Holm as Bilbo Baggins, and I thought Elijah Wood did a nice job as well. There are some mildly good points to say about this film. But, the story goes on far too long. Many will say, so what! If that's your only complaint about a movie, well, that's  not a good one. I got news for you, it's the best one! Cause if your bored watching a movie, clearly what your watching is not holding your attention. Your not interested in the characters, the action, or anything else for that matter. If they would of cut this movie down to at least two hours maybe my reaction would be so strongly against it. I will never understand the hype surrounding this movie, nor will I ever understand why it's the #1 pick on this database. It's actually over such films as The Godfather, Wild Strawberries, & The Bicycle Thief!

Every cinematic plot point ever made in history is paraded across the screen, leaving the second half of this film more limpid than the first.What's ironic is that this film starts with Appleton sitting in a room twitching his face while the producers mangle his script to make it more hollywoodesque. I guess we are supposed to laugh at the fact that these producers (recognize the voices?

It stands as one of the best films of the 90s and thats why it won awards. ","genre":"Drama, Romance"},{"date":"6 January 2002","score":"","review":"  An interesting question If M. Night Shyamalan had made `Unbreakable' before `The Sixth Sense', what would have happened? I think, the world would have praised `Unbreakable', nominated it for some Academy Awards and then said about the second movie Well, it's almost as good as the first one.In fact, I think these two Shyamalan movies are rather equal. The quality of cinematography, music and acting is the same in both pictures, the story is mysterious enough to hold one's breath for 100 minutes and the ending presents us with a more or less unexpected surprise. Only the fact that in `Unbreakable' there is no fascinating kid, and that after the unbelievable `6th Sense'-ending a more brilliant twist is impossible, gave `Unbreakable' small chance to succeed equally.I admit, the ending of this movie went completely wrong. I don't mean the plot twist, I mean the screenplay and the directing. After I knew the truth, I had the impression, Shyamalan was in a hurry to finish the movie. Suddenly it was over. And showing texts which tell us what happened to the protagonists later like in a true story drama, is a really stupid idea in a mystery thriller like this.But apart from that, I enjoyed &#132;Unbreakable`, although I was already familiar with this &#132;new` kind of mystery-thriller-drama.

The movie is far to long; it needs not be two and a half hour in order to tell the story. Each sequence is just far too long!
