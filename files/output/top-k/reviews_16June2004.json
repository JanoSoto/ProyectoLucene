Maybe not a lot, but at least one or two. Then I saw The Shining.In 1997, my friends and I read the book and then saw the TV movie. We all liked the book and the TV movie. Then, one of them saw this film and told us not to watch it because it disgraced the book. Well, I watched it anyway. I can't believe my friend didn't like. Sure, it wasn't all that true to the book, but it was great and entertaining, which is what most movies aim for.The book scared the crap out of me. The TV movie was kind of scary, but not really. This movie is the scariest thing I've ever seen. Everything about it was terrifying the blood in the elevator, the woman in the bathtub, and, most of all, the girls in the hallway. I can't tell you how much that scared me. I literally had to pause the movie to make my heart stop beating so fast. The thing was, I had read about how scary the girls were in this movie, but I didn't think they'd actually be this scary! I was proved wrong. So everything you read about the girls is true. And everything else, yes. They are horrifying.Yet, in a way, it's mind-blowing. Stephen King's book really makes you think and it took my friends and I a long time to fully understand everything. Kubrick adapts that book into a screenplay and adds even more for the viewer to think about. If you haven't read the book and you go to see this movie, I couldn't imagine how much thinking that is. Something like that is extraordinary.Jack Nicholson was perfect. There's no other word to describe it. When I saw the TV movie, I thought that actor was okay, but he wasn't how I imagined Jack Torrence when I read the book. Jack Nicholson not only gives his best performance in this film, but he also portrays Torrance like I had imagined him. Danny Lloyd was terrific in his big screen debut (and sadly, his last) and Shelley Duvall was....decent. Oh yes, Scatman Crothers was good as well. You know what, I'll just stop naming people. Everyone from Nicholson to the extras were great.Overall, this is a movie you simply can't miss. Don't listen to anyone when they say that The Exorcist or Psycho or Rosemary's Baby are the scariest movies. They are all scary, but I can't imagine anything being any more terrifying than this masterpiece.10\/10.

Since the invention of the computer and its applications to animated feature films, cartoon characters now look almost as if they were real.  The attention to detail that these animators put in is incredible, which is why it takes several years to complete just one animated movie.Animated and non-animated movies have one very important thing in common; no matter how you slice it, if it isn't a good story, it's not worth seeing, no matter how good the animation is.  (For example, Final Fantasy was amazing to look at, but not much fun to watch.)You can't even compare TSON with modern-day animated films like Shrek and Finding Nemo, in the respect of sophistication.  Those films, along with all the other Pixar movies, will stand as classics because of their ground-breaking techniques.  On a pure story-line basis, however, I would stack TSON against any animated movie, period.This movie was specifically aimed at kids, which is what I was when I first saw it.  But even with my childhood years well behind me, I am ever amazed by how much I still enjoy watching this movie.  The characters are engaging and sympathetic, and the actors playing their voices did so were well chosen for their roles.Yes, this movie is a lot more serious and dark than any cartoon movie that Disney has ever put out.  Yes, small children may well be frightened by it.  But where is it written that animated movies, even movies made for children, have to be happy movies?  This movie deals with the highly controversial topic of animal experimentation, and that's something that even kids should know about.Mrs. Brisby, as courageous a mouse as has ever been drawn, has lost her husband and has just learned that her youngest son is seriously ill.  He cannot be moved or he might die, which is compounded by the fact that the day the tractor comes to plow the field (Moving Day) is rapidly approaching.Many movies have shown what lengths a desperate mother will go to to save her children, but few have done it better than this one.  Despite her emotional fragility, Mrs. Brisby takes on the farmer's evil cat and then the tractor itself.  She then embarks upon a perilous journey where she must seek the advice of the Great Owl (Owls EAT mice!), and from there to the rats who escaped, with her late husband, from NIMH.There are plenty of scary moments  the chase scene with Dragon; the tractor scene; Mrs. Brisby's encounter with Brutus, the rat guarding the entrance to the rat's lair; and finally, the final scene where she must save her home and her children from a terrible death.  But to counteract the darkness of the overall theme, there's one character who was added to lighten the mood and make us laugh Jeremy, the friendly but clumsy crow, voiced superbly by Dom DeLuise.  (The bit at the end where he trips over Cynthia ALWAYS makes me bust out laughing.)Having read the book, I'm not sure how I felt about the addition of the magical elements the movie incorporated; it was never really explained where the stones came from or how the rats got them.  But in the big picture, I can forgive this irregularity for the effect the movie had on me.If you are reading this review, having not yet seen this movie, I would highly recommend watching it.  The animation is wonderful (even though it's 20+ years old), and the dialogue and characters are so genuine you'd swear they were real.  The story line is bold and intriguing, with enough memorable heroes and villains to make it worth seeing it over and over again.A definite 10.

The jokes maybe immature but if they were immature AND funny I wouldn't mind. Instead these are some of the stupidest jokes that will leave you wondering why anybody would have written them.

In one scene they are in class and are completely ignoring the teachers request that they stop swearing. Instead they just keep swearing. For some reason this is supposed to be funny. With all the swearing in that scene there is pretty much no joke the entire time. Someone gets called fat someone else gets called a Jew. Maybe if the lines were clever or something it could have been funny. But no it is just pure stupidity. There are really only a couple reason why people might find this movie funny1. They find jokes insulting fat people, Jews, Black people, foreigners, and pretty much any minority group to be hilarious. I am not so uptight as to think this movie is so bad because it insults this group or that group or blah blah blah. I am not one who thinks any joke that pokes fun at a certain group is automatically not funny. The fact is the jokes used are JUST NOT CLEVER, ORIGINAL, OR FUNNY. And that's just when they use jokes. The writers often don't use jokes at all and yet expect me to laugh. When watching it in the theater everyone laughed when someone was called a Jew. There was no actual joke just the word Jew. If there was some kind of small joke there maybe it could have a chance at being funny. BUT NO! He just says Jew and I am expected to laugh at that like its some kind of brilliant joke.

That is not going to convince any people that are borderline on the issues of censorship that it is a bad thing. All it will do is push those people further towards the side of supporting censorship.To sum it up, this movie has bad jokes that are few and far apart, pointless usage of bad language and violence, and bad animation with bad voice-overs.2\/10 A very very low 2.

I'm fine with underground stuff, but this kinds of things suffer from just a small problem Underground locations tend to have rather inadequate lighting, which often means people fumble there, and the result is something that's just plain awful to look at in broad daylight. The plot is a nonsensical collection of jokes that may or may not have been funny at the moment. The drawings must have looked really good in complete darkness, but not really so now.

Dracula is a very decent movie but not a classic, even though I simply adore Gary Oldman and love his simply amazing portrayal of Dracula in this film. A true joy to watch and never one to disappoint. His evil laugh during the baby scene is one for the history books....too evil for words. Chilling. It also has Keanu Reeves in it, my least favorite actor. Keanu can't act to save his life, and the only rational reason for his movie appearances (notice I didn't say performances) is the fact that he's a panty waist pushover that will never object to anything any director asks him to do which makes him more palatable as a casting choice, I suppose. I can't imagine anyone who would actually think he's a good or great actor. I respect Coppola but I have no idea what in the hell he was thinking when he cast this joke and at the same time displayed impeccable taste by casting Oldman. Without Keananu, I might like it a little better. At least his role is fairly minimal.I do enjoy watching this film very much and I even own it, but when I view it I'm simply waiting for Oldman to appear and display his talent. The guy is a chameleon with all of the different accents he has successfully portrayed over his years of playing villains and never falls below my high expectations, even in films that are mediocre. His Transylvanian accent is so thick that it's difficult to believe that he doesn't actually speak that way. Winona Ryder is satisfactory as Dracula's lover but she always reminds me of an upset little sister with her pouty expressions and melodrama. I will admit that there is quite an unusual amount of chemistry between her and Oldman here. Anthony Hopkins plays Van Helsing, the vampire hunter, and is amusing to watch and also does a fine job with his accent.I think the reason the film wasn't perfect other than the questionable casting choices is that it seems to take the road of style over substance. I feel it could have been perfect. The sets, costumes, and musical score are all great and the story progresses quite nicely but it seems absurd at times. Also, Coppola must've had a massive unrelenting erection while filming. The unneeded nudity and sexual provocative-ness of the female vampires seems a little silly sometimes. This very well could have been in Bram Stoker's book, which I have not read, and I could be entirely wrong but it seems to be a little much even though I truly love breasts. Some of the special effects are poor which is most likely a result of Coppolla's studio approaching bankruptcy during filming. Other than that the film has a great story and is filmed beautifully and is very enjoyable to watch. Overall, above average. I would love to see Gary get more starring roles.

The mall chase scene is probably one of my favourite pieces of motion picture ever. The humour associated with Carrie Fisher's assaults is also to die for - Who IS that girl?, It's nine o'clock - we gotta go to work and There must be at least seven dollars worth of change here are some of the best lines in the film. Can't really say much that hasn't already been said, but if you haven't seen the film, make sure you do, and if you have, then watch it again! Classic.

And yes, I have seen a LOT of movies.One of the quick complaints to dispel is that it's a complain-fest as one reviewer-said. No, this is NOT a movie about the middle class white man being held down. It's a movie about responsibility, cause-and-effect, and what happens when you do nothing with your life and just let yourself slide into a hole without even once scraping to get out.That said, as others have mentioned, very little can be said of this movie. The fight scenes are not like most movies, intended to be action sequences as a nice break between plot development, they're as much a part of the story as anything else. Ed Norton is our protagonist of sorts who finds his life miserable and eventually meets the one and only Tyler Durden.Fight Club, coincidentally enough, gained success much like the following inside the movie itself. The ads for it were terrible, making it look like a mindless action movie. Reviews seemed half-hearted. I didn't know many people who saw it in theaters. But after renting the DVD on a suggestion, I actually felt changed. VERY few movies can alter your perception of the world around you like this one can. By the time the credits were rolling, my heart was pumping furiously.Do not watch this movie unless you can sit down and watch it without interruption. It's not a party movie, nor one to watch with someone who has already seen it unless they stay silent. The beauty of this movie is the shock as the scenes go on. It's a tornado of a movie, where we get to watch the decay of a man. Each scene is more unraveled and chaotic than the one before it. Each shot is done perfectly, the filming style and the color is gorgeous (in its own sick way), the sound and music are a perfect match.
