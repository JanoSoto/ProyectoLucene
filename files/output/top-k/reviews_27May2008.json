Some examples were the Die Hard movies, True Lies, and The Rock. Sadly, those days are gone, with today's summer action movies being dumbed down and neutered to get every kid from the target audience into the theater (the fact that movies make a ton of money if they are good no matter what the rating still hasn't occurred to the producers).The Rock represents a farewell to this kind of movie. It's very violent, but for the most part not very heavy. The story is compelling, and it has plenty of original ideas and characters that are actually intelligent. The actors do terrific jobs, and the action sequences are tightly done. There are some one-liners to be sure, but not enough to make the movie an action-comedy. It's one of those movies that is the definition of what a summer action movie is supposed to be.The story formula is familiar, but the creators do enough with it that it seems fresh and alive. An angered general takes Alcatraz hostage and aims missiles armed with deadly gas at San Francisco. The US government sends a team of Navy Seals in to take them down. Joining them are a chemical weapons specialist and the one man who escaped from Alcatraz.With names like Steven Segal and Arnold Schwartzenegger, two of Hollywood's most notoriously wooden actors (Schwartzenegger's True Lies being an exception), being some of the most famous poster-boys of the summer action movie genre, it would be sensible to guess that like most other action movies, acting is not a plus point. On the contrary, acting one of the reasons why this movie works so well. Every actor is believable in his role. Nicholas Cage, fresh off of his Oscar win for Leaving Las Vegas, is perfectly understated in the fish-out-of-water role. He's a self-described chemical weapons super-freak, but he's grounded enough for the audience to sympathize with him. John Mason may be a character that many talented actors could play, but after watching this movie, it's hard to imagine any other actor than Sean Connery playing it this well. I guess it makes sense for the original James Bond to still be doing this halfway into his sixties, but clearly age hasn't taken its toll on Connery at this point because he performs the role with a slick wit and the capability of firing a gun without reading glasses (haha). Probably the most important role here is that of General Hummel (Ed Harris). Though he's a villain, the way Harris portrays the character is key to the movie's success. As villainous as Hummel is for doing what he does, Harris plays Hummel with such passion that the character comes to life and he believes every word that he is saying. This is key because it makes the situation that much more serious, and it sets the tone for the rest of the movie. If you can't believe in what the villain is saying, than who cares? The supporting actors are great as well. John Spencer, William Forsythe, the vastly under-rated Michael Biehn, and a charming performance by Vanessa Marcil (why she doesn't get any big roles is beyond me, cause while not the best actress, she's certainly a lot better than many of the more popular beauties out there).Bruckheimer favorite Michael Bay is returning after directing Bad Boys, which while not bad, it pales at the likes of The Rock (then again, not much else can match up to this movie). Armed with a better script and a more compelling story, Bay makes it clear that when it comes to directing action movies, he is a force to be reckoned with. He knows exactly what he's doing. Every action sequence is expertly choreographed, and the pacing is perfect. Though the end has a distinct lack of intelligence that's not present in the rest of the film, I am more than willing to forgive because it's still tremendously exciting anyway. It's hard to imagine a movie that's more exciting or suspenseful than this.As I said before, The Rock represents the last of its kind the summer action movie for adults. Though few would disagree that the MPAA is notoriously easy-going when it comes to rating a movie based on violence, even the MPAA knew it couldn't get away with giving this one anything less than an R. There's a lot of violence here, and a lot of it is intense. Some of the scenes are hard to watch. I would definitely recommend at least previewing it first before showing it to anyone under the age of 15. Though this limits the target audience, this is a good decision because in order for suspense and excitement to take place, what happens on screen has to get our attention, and the in-your-face approach that an R rating allows accomplishes this. Additionally, the audience has to buy the premise, preferably within its own context. Sometimes this can be rather disturbing in some sense, but that makes the action believable, which is key for suspense. An action movie like this with a PG-13 rating loses that intimacy, which inevitably reduces the excitement level. This is a shame because some movies with the potential to be really exciting have been ruined by producer neutering (Jerry Bruckheimer has completely sold out by doing this for EVERY movie that he does now-Pearl Harbor would be a great example of this).Fast-paced, relentless, and terrifically exciting, The Rock is probably the best farewell to the adult-oriented summer action movie genre that one could hope for.

This perhaps makes this movie a bit more outdated than others but it shows how Hitchcock tried out different things and techniques to develop his style and redefine the thriller genre.It's a movie that definitely would had been a better one had it been made 10 years later, with its more modern film-making techniques. This goes for quite some of the most earliest Hitchcock movies, which also really proofs that Hitchcock was a director who was ahead of his time.The fact that this is a '30's thriller and directed by Hitchcock of course makes this a more special than average movie. The thriller genre wasn't that well established in the '30's and it was Hitchcock among others that pretty much defined the genre, that really started to take off in the '40's, with its WW II theme based spy thrillers mostly, which also triggered more and more general thriller movies to be made during that particular time period.The movie does has some trademark Hitchcock suspense moments and twists, which should really especially please the Hitchock fans.Yet this isn't one of the great Hitchcock movies.

Start with the simple idea a man can reject his former bad life if he goes straight. However, sometimes the past has a reach and when one least expects it attempts to extract it's revenge. Nothing original here, but after that practically everything about this movie is original and well crafted I would imagine it to be one, if not the best, film school examples of the genre.Cinematography, it starts immediately with the symbolism of crossroads (life's decisions?). Also unusual visual points of view, for instance like the viewer is traveling in Joe's car and seeing how Jeff's hiding in plain sight is his first mistake. Still, though there's something about this town that may save Jeff, while the main road is cosmopolitan enough the camera clearly shows just a block away it looks like old west prairie with the simple frame church and the symbol of salvation for the fallen.There's not really a need to go on and on because the viewer can see how excellent the lighting, framing, and directing of every shot is. Because the movie is so good you'll want to watch it again it's likely the viewer will pick up even more with repeated viewings. Beyond this more technical part is the artistic part. The three principals put in real powerhouse roles. Mitchum is both seemingly able to take care of himself in any situation, a real wise-guy who grew a real (not jail house) conscience. His Jeff Bailey projects strength yet is strangely vulnerable to both his past and his emotions (i.e.., believable). Kurt Douglass plays Whit Sterling with so well the camera just hugs his every nuance with strange affection. It's obvious that an iconic star has arrived. And Jane Greer, well not a Hollywood bombshell type, she possesses a girlish beauty and here it's juxtaposed against a damaged world weary detachment. Something a man like Jeff is willing to believe in since he's also running away. Ms. Greer actually had me thinking her character was sweet..Ha! She is perfect for this role.Suffice to say that beyond the beautiful location scenery and top notch acting the story gets more interesting due to what I like to call left turns in the script. You won't see them coming and then when the next one is heaped on top you will wonder where it's all going. That is truly the way to keep interest-when the plot twists are not simply for shock, but serve the development of the overall story. Could this film be any better? I really do not think so.

Start with the simple idea a man can reject his former bad life if he goes straight. However, sometimes the past has a reach and when one least expects it attempts to extract it's revenge. Nothing original here, but after that practically everything about this movie is original and well crafted I would imagine it to be one, if not the best, film school examples of the genre.Cinematography, it starts immediately with the symbolism of crossroads (life's decisions?). Also unusual visual points of view, for instance like the viewer is traveling in Joe's car and seeing how Jeff's hiding in plain sight is his first mistake. Still, though there's something about this town that may save Jeff, while the main road is cosmopolitan enough the camera clearly shows just a block away it looks like old west prairie with the simple frame church and the symbol of salvation for the fallen.There's not really a need to go on and on because the viewer can see how excellent the lighting, framing, and directing of every shot is. Because the movie is so good you'll want to watch it again it's likely the viewer will pick up even more with repeated viewings. Beyond this more technical part is the artistic part. The three principals put in real powerhouse roles. Mitchum is both seemingly able to take care of himself in any situation, a real wise-guy who grew a real (not jail house) conscience. His Jeff Bailey projects strength yet is strangely vulnerable to both his past and his emotions (i.e.., believable). Kurt Douglass plays Whit Sterling with so well the camera just hugs his every nuance with strange affection. It's obvious that an iconic star has arrived. And Jane Greer, well not a Hollywood bombshell type, she possesses a girlish beauty and here it's juxtaposed against a damaged world weary detachment. Something a man like Jeff is willing to believe in since he's also running away. Ms. Greer actually had me thinking her character was sweet..Ha! She is perfect for this role.Suffice to say that beyond the beautiful location scenery and top notch acting the story gets more interesting due to what I like to call left turns in the script. You won't see them coming and then when the next one is heaped on top you will wonder where it's all going. That is truly the way to keep interest-when the plot twists are not simply for shock, but serve the development of the overall story. Could this film be any better? I really do not think so.

Andersen's tale has been loved by readers all over the world for years. Disney transformed the book into an animated film which is full of rich music. Both are a 'love story' between a pure little mermaid and a good looking warmhearted prince. However, the film departs from its book version in its characters in the nature of the conflict between goodness and evil, and their endings to reveal another world of creativity.The film approaches its supporting characters differently than the original. The film introduces more a dynamic sea witch called Ursula as another main character. While the sea witch plays only a minor in the book, Disney's Ursula uses Ariel, the little mermaid, as bait to catch her father in a plot for revenge. Moreover, the animated movie invents attractive supporting characters such as Sebastian, the crab who always enjoys giving advice, Flouder, who is a close friend of Ariel, and Scuttle, who is considered a clumsy expert in the world of human. In addition, Max and Grimsby are the faithful supporters of Eric, the prince whom Ariel saves from the wrecked ship and falls in love with. These charming characters help audience numbers to enjoy the film. Both versions also differ in the nature of the conflict between the main characters. While the book explores the conflict of the little mermaid with herself, the movie focuses on the conflict between goodness and evil to reveal the meaning of justice. In the film, Ursula represents evil, taking any cruel action to gain whatever she wants. She is portrayed as a half-human and half-octopus witch banished by Triton, like Satan was banished by God. Ursula seduces the little mermaid in a spell for her revenge and takes away her voice. She even disguises herself as a pretty lady to hold back Ariel's love. On the other hand, Eric, King Triton and Ariel's friends represent goodness. For example, Eric realizes Ariel was the one who rescued him and loves her with all his heart. So he fights against the sea witch to keep his pure love. In the case of Triton, he is willing to sacrifice his life for his headstrong daughter, showing an unconditional parents' love. In addition, Ariel's friends understand Ariel's pure love and help her. These symbols such as pure love, unconditional sacrifice and deep friendship are always supposed to win at the end and overcome any obstacle. Disney wants to give the audience of a valuable lesson. There is also a different ending story in the film. While the book has a sad ending, the film concludes its happy ending They live happily ever after. For instance, in the book, the little mermaid is willing to give her life up for her unrequited love and becomes foam in spite of her sibling's earnest request. Her love story is gloomy and melancholy. It gives the message to readers to adopt fate and not to defy it. On the other hand, the movie reveals a different vision at the end. The film works toward its happy ending, encouraging audience members to have courage and be willing to fulfill whatever they really desire instead of warning us not to dream about what we don't possess. In the long run, both versions have their own different visions of fate. One tells that fate is given; the other tells that fate is made by people themselves.The Disney film is willing to change the well-known fairy tale to conclude with a happy ending with its own point of view. In this respect, it is meaningful that the Disney film shows entertainment of changing the old-fashioned fairy tale into a new dynamic film filled with unforgettable music. Furthermore, the differences in characters, conflicts and endings in both versions explore that an imaginary world is always unlimited and changeable. Thus, when people read books or watch movies, if they give full play to their imagination instead of accepting the story itself literally, they can gain more abundant pleasure and enjoy their own exploration in the story.

the setting helped the shot selection pick itself, anyway, but they nailed it each and every time for a feast for the eyes, after all the carefully and minimally revealed exposition - and the style of filming all lend an atmosphere to a setting that can't age quickly and that remains timeless, effective and immersive even now, and it presents a veritable feast of effective aspects of atmosphere and exposition for the budding film maker to learn from, and the viewer to enjoy.and besides all that, the predator was fantastic. bizarre and positively alien motivations and intentions, a hunter for the sake of it, elegant, vicious and deadly, with functional and dirty but effective and sleek equipment and an approach to hunting that denoted graft and perverse machismo, and sheer strength as well as fearsome weaponry. he was played masterfully, and the complacency which led to his undoing and the simplicity in which dutch finished him are tolerable when weighed against his awesome strength, brutality and demonstrated power. a great creation, that was not quite represented adequately in the sequel - compensated with the ending on the ship; not like the 2 AvP movies which relied on sheer idiocy, complacency on a less forgivable or believable level on the part of the predator race, as well as implausible and hard to digest back story and illogically pointless enterprises conducted on earth, unlike the hint given at the end of predator 2. comics, games and movies have created a fan-base who have been largely betrayed by overkill exposition and poorly conceived plotting that has ruined and cheapened the mystique constructed in this movie, only really maintained in the sequel, the game AvP 2 and perhaps a handful of comics. it remains a pleasure to indulge in and be awed by that mystique on subsequent viewings of Predator.it's a visceral, engaging, simple, macho, atmospheric, glorious, intriguing SF thriller about a mysterious alien warrior wreaking havoc in a central American jungle, stalking and butchering an elite unit of American soldiers on a mission, headed by Arnie, a film that presents the optimal SF thriller experience in all facets, that is also cooler then almost anything else you're ever likely to see.mine's as big as a house! oh baby! havin me some fun tonight!

Gattaca is one of them. This is probably the best sci-fi of the 90's, a thoroughly engaging, entertaining and fascinating story about a genetically imperfect man (Ethan Hawke) who assumes the identity of a member of the genetic elite (Jude Law), but lives a nightmare when he becomes the main suspect of a murder.

And I mean that; the stupid is just OVERFLOWING out of this film. I watched it immediately after watching Escape from New York, and be sure, this monstrosity of a sequel does no justice whatsoever to the first film.Let me do a recap of just SOME of the stupid for you - The terrorist in this film is the PRESIDENT'S DAUGHTER and she joins forces with a bad Che Guevara knockoff.- In one of the opening scenes of the film Plisskin inexplicably tries to blow away two of the people sending him on his mission, despite the fact that he NEEDS THEM in order to carry out his mission. His gun makes a lot of noise but doesn't harm them, at which point the two people tell him, We thought you'd do that. That's why we filled your first magazine with blanks. GENIUS! They totally KNEW that Plisskin would randomly try to kill them for no reason whatsoever.-Shortly after this scene, Plisskin embarks upon his journey to Los Angeles by way of a jet-powered submarine that can SOMEHOW GENERATE THRUST UNDERWATER (as if it were a a fighter jet) DESPITE THAT THIS VIOLATES BASIC LAWS OF PHYSICS. While underwater, he puts the thruster into 100% overdrive, ignoring his commanding officers (the ones he randomly tried to kill earlier) who advise him that he shouldn't do so. What follow are shots of Kurt Russell in his submarine careening through one of the most laughably bad CGI sequences ever put to film. The highlight of this sequence is that, as Kurt Russell is underwater, he passes the wreckage of Universal Studios sign, and a giant shark comes out of nowhere and tries to eat the submarine, but misses it completely. The shark is completely unconvincing and wreaks of not only a poor special effects budget, but also a poor effort on the part of the effects team all around.-A scene in which Kurt Russell surfs a giant tidal wave in a sewer while AT THE SAME TIME Steve Buscemi is cruising alongside him in a hot ride. (I can't make this stuff up) -And finally, in order to save his life, Plisskin must earn 10 points in a basketball court. Plisskin DOES accomplish this heroic feat (we are literally shown Russell running up to the goal to make lay-ups) and yet the bad guy (the Che Guevara knockoff) STILL decides to shoot him, but remarkably, Plisskin just hops over the fence and escapes unscathed. (Also of note in this scene. We first see a guy who doesn't get 10 points, and so he is shot. The way this is done is so brainless... basically there are tons of set up right outside the fence, lining the basketball court. So picture the basketball court as a rectangle, and there are guys EVERYWHERE, on all sides of the rectangle, tons of them. Well, when they are ordered to kill the guy, EVERY ONE OF THEM fires blindly at the guy in the center of the court. If this movie had an ounce of intelligence, most of the bad guys would be dead from shooting each other!) -Toward the end of the film, Plisskin hangglides (along with Buscemi and the president's daughter) into a warzone, mowing guys down with a submachine gun, all the while remaining completely unscathed.Now rest assured -- if you consider yourself a connoisseur of the stupid, there is PLENTY more of it in this film. What I offered are simply SOME of the highlights. And no, none of this is intended as camp. I have SEEN camp, and this is not it. This is ATROCIOUS and indecisive writing that tries to do a lot of things and FAILS at everything. As if the barrage of stupid weren't enough, the plot is also incoherent and unclear.What really kills this movie for me is the wasted opportunity it is. Escape From New York was at its core an enjoyable movie that took liberties with reality but ultimately followed it more than it deviated. In EFNY, Plisskin was just a badass war veteran taking people out with his silenced TMP submachine gun. In EFLA, Plisskin is some kind of borderline comic book super hero with a trench-coat and placticized toy-looking guns that have no place in reality. Really, NONE of this movie has any place in reality, which made my suspension of disbelief IMPOSSIBLE. The events of EFNY were a little out there, sure, but not to the extent that I couldn't suspend belief and enjoy things.EFLA is dumb trash, plain and simple. I don't even recommend this movie to hardcore EFNY fans as you have already seen this movie -- the GOOD version.

At the very least, they have been stupid and cruel since the mid 1920's. Fritz Lang's Metropolis captures very well the essence of this insanity of the mob mentality. Painted against the backdrop of a dystopian society, Metropolis tells the story of a Marxist type setting where class conflict exists between the planners of the upper city and the workers who toil underground to keep the city's machines in order. The heart of Metropolis is one where the privileged rely on the work of the oppressed and the only two people with any strength of will are nearly spurned by the ignorant masses.One of the main assumptions throughout the film is that the workers are miserable, but given hope through the peaceful preaching of Maria. Essentially, in realistic fashion, the thinkers and planners take advantage of the workers and care not about how difficult it is for them to live as they operate the machines below the surface. The film contends that correspondence between the brain and the hands or the thinkers and workers is impossible without the heart acting as a mediator. There must be one who understands both sides to mediate because alone the two are too different from each other as evidenced by Fredersen's attempt to further control the masses with the robot, and the ensuing attempts of the workers to destroy the city, despite their better judgments.The film's greatest strength lies in its ability to skillfully portray the tendency of people in large groups to follow the voice of a leader. The workers quickly flock to Maria's words, though why they choose to follow her is not exactly explained. Perhaps it's because she acts as the only positive presence in the workers' lives. At any rate, it is a bit strange that every one of the workers continues to follow the robot Maria even though she essentially goes completely against the real Maria's previous ideology. It is thus both commendable and disturbing that the film manages to assume that none of the workers can think for themselves. What's more, the film doesn't do the best job of differentiating between the Marias and it can become a bit confusing to follow which is which.Metropolis is a film that largely succeeds, especially when considering its time. The cinematography is well done, as is the expressive acting, and it should be given that it is a silent film. The film had the potential to be a bit more interesting Perhaps instead of the robot Maria being burned at the stake, it could have been the real Maria, only to have the workers find out that the robot was the real malefactor. Something like this might have prompted the workers to take a bit more care before deciding foolishly to destroy their city.
