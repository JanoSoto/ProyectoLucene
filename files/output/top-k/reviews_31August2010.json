It's been nearly three years since I got around to watching the 1988 David Zucker\/Jerry Zucker film, The Naked Gun From the Files of Police Squad! and its two sequels, 1991's The Naked Gun 2½ The Smell of Fear and 1994's Naked Gun 33 1\/3 The Final Insult, neither of which lived up to the original. I didn't find the third installment in the trilogy funny at all, after finding the second one to be hit and miss. For a while now, I've known that Airplane! was another Zucker effort (I now know that Jim Abrahams was involved in the making of both movies as well), and both films are very popular parodies. I also knew that both of them featured Leslie Nielsen in the cast. It took me a while, but I was intending to watch this 1980 comedy eventually, since I found The Naked Gun so funny, and now that's finally happened. For a while, it looked like I wasn't going to find it nearly as funny as so many other viewers have, but that didn't last.Ted Striker is a former American fighter pilot who is now a cab driver. He was traumatized during his service in a certain war, so he now suffers from a fear of flying and a drinking problem (not alcoholism, but the fact that he misses his mouth when he tries to drink). At an airport filled with religious people trying to get others to make donations, Ted meets his former lover, Elaine Dickinson, who is currently a stewardess and is no longer interested in him. Determined to win her back, the ex-soldier decides to face his fear of flying and buy a ticket for the next flight Elaine will be serving on. During this flight, it isn't long before Elaine discovers that Ted is on board, but unfortunately, his attempts to save their relationship continue to fail, and this flight is headed for a lot of trouble! He sits beside various other passengers on the plane and tells them about his days as a fighter pilot, how he met Elaine, and experiences he had with her, but listening to him makes these passengers suicidal! Eventually, the vast majority of the passengers fall ill from food poisoning, and after this problem starts, the pilots soon fall ill for the same reason, meaning they can no longer operate the plane! The film begins at the airport, and there sure are some funny parts here. The first REALLY funny one might be the argument between the two announcers about the red zone and the white zone. To me, it looked promising around this time, but didn't quite stay that way. I wasn't sure what I thought of all the flashbacks and more than one romance scene with a romantic musical score. For a while, it seemed only mildly amusing to me, and not enough to carry the film, but I then found that it improved. The flashbacks get funnier, with scenes such as the male soldier who thinks he's Ethel Merman (played by the real Ethel Merman) and others. Many funny things happen on the plane as well, such as the reactions of the passengers who listen to Ted's stories, a kid named Joey in the cockpit of the plane recognizing one of the pilots, Roger Murdock as basketball player Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (who plays this character), the hysterical woman being shaken and slapped by several different passengers, the automatic pilot (an inflatable pilot which is funny to look at), etc. The cast performances in general are good, and Leslie Nielsen doesn't appear for a while, but once he does, he sure helps a lot with the humour in the role of Dr. Rumack, saying funny lines such as, Don't call me Shirley (in response to Ted saying surely). Also, some very funny things happen in the scenes involving members of the control tower staff.28 years after the release of this successful comedy, a spoof film known as Disaster Movie came into theatres, which was written and directed by the mysterious and despicable Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer. I don't know how many times I've said how much I hated Epic Movie, another film of theirs released the year before that, which is why I've refused to watch any other movies they've done in the past four years, since none of them seem to have a better reputation than the one I saw! So, I haven't seen 2008's Disaster Movie and don't intend to, but know that as well as receiving a lot of criticism for being atrociously unfunny, it has also been criticized for its misleading title, as some of the movies spoofed in it are certainly not disaster ones. I can most definitely believe that, but Airplane! is a REAL disaster movie spoof, even though it doesn't have the word disaster in the title, and is MUCH funnier than anything Friedberg and Seltzer could probably ever dream of doing! I can't say I agree with those who say this 1980 spoof is one of the funniest movies or the funniest movie of all time, but if comedies filled with slapstick and silliness appeal to you, it is worth watching.

So much more is known now about human psychology, and the world has been witness to child soldiers, school shootings, and other crimes perpetrated by children on both adults and other children that the film's shock value has diminished since 1956.Still, the movie deserves some credit for broaching a topic that, in its time, was both novel and disturbing. It remains a well-acted piece, aided in no small part by having most of the Broadway cast transplanted directly onto the big screen for this effort. And by having the main character be a ten year-old *girl,* who seems outwardly as sweet and perfect as a character out of a Norman Rockwell cover from the Saturday Evening Post, it still plays against one's expectations of how children are supposed to behave -- and what can lie beneath the surface of those childlike appearances.It is not, of course, without its flaws. As many of the other reviews have noted, it does almost nothing to disguise its stage origins -- characters are forever entering or exiting doorways, there are set-piece moments and speeches for many of the characters (Leroy the handyman even talks directly to the audience a few times), and one can imagine exactly how even the outdoor scenes, such as the picnic by the lake, would be done on stage, likely with a small spotlighted scene on an apron alongside the main stage. It's too bad that director Mervyn LeRoy didn't try to open up the picture more than he did, so that it wouldn't feel as if the movie were filmed while being presented in a theater.Still, what redeems The Bad Seed even for today's viewing audiences is the marvelous acting -- both Nancy Kelly as Rhoda's mother and Patty McCormack as the title character herself are wonderful, and McCormack, who must carry a number of scenes, is remarkably poised for a ten year-old. The film also benefited from having the likes of Eileen Heckart as the mother of the little boy Rhoda is suspected of having killed for a penmanship medal that, throughout the story, she just can't seem to give up.And for those who grew up in the television generation, there's the added pleasure of spotting a number of actors who would make their marks later on television, including future Perry Mason sidekick Paul Drake (William Hopper), Frank Cady, who would play general store owner Sam Drucker on Petticoat Junction and two other television series in the mid-1960s, and the ubiquitous character actor Henry Jones as Leroy, the only character who can see through Rhoda's facade of sweetness. Indeed, in some ways Rhoda presages Eddie Haskell of Leave it to Beaver, alternately obsequious around adults and creepy around his peers. Considering that Leroy describes himself as the only person who's just like Rhoda -- something of a sociopath himself -- Leroy is the one character who allows Rhoda to show herself as she is.

Jennifer Beals plays the busy and feisty 18 year old with the dream in this Adrian Lyne directed video-like story. The movie is full of music and video snippets without a whole lot of dialogue and this fills up the movie instead of a story. You never really get a chance to understand the characters because of this choice by the director. You understand what the characters want, but you never really get a fully-developed why for any of the characters. There are some other minor characters that carry dreams as well -- like a cook who wants to be a comedienne at the local bar where the Beals' character dances. So the real purpose of the story is to show you not to stop reaching for your dreams, but the shallowness of the characters do not help you care. Beals is sexy and enticing at times but is never really given much of an opportunity to act, and when she's given it she doesn't do it that well. The boyfriend, played by Michael Nouri, is just an older middle-aged guy honkering for a younger chic and the Beals' character fits the bill for him.

Do you feel lucky? No, wait. I meant, do you find this image enthralling, or -- let's not demand too much -- in any way interesting? It's the turn of the century in South America. There is this mammoth river steamboat, all beaten up and lopsided but still seaworthy. It's huffing along some river that you've never heard of in the upper reaches of the Amazon. A knot of Europeans stands on the muddy shore, waving and cheering, but you could sail up the river for hundreds of miles and encounter nobody but illiterate laborers and indigenous head hunters.Aboard this brave but decrepit boat an opera, The Carmelites, is being performed with a full orchestra and the entire cast. The only audience aboard the boat is a handful of silent, motionless Amazonian aborigines with their faces painted scarlet, who don't know what a drinking glass is, let alone what the champagne within it is supposed to be.On the upper deck, towards the stern, stands Klaus Kinski with a footlong cigar in his mouth, smiling proudly as he brings opera to the remoter regions of the earth. The aria rings out from the Italian orchestra and the tenor and is damped down and lost in the surrounding jungle.I only ask because that is the climactic scene in this outlandish and perplexing movie. And it's a happy ending, too.But, as you can see, it's not what anyone would call a typically Hollywood happy ending.Kinski is Fitzcarraldo -- the closest the native Amazonians can get to his real name, Fitzgerald -- and he's obsessed with Enrico Caruso and with opera in general. He's mad for opera in the most literal sense. And it's his responsibility, he feels, to bring opera to the unenlightened masses of bare asses who labor in the mud of isolated rubber plantations or spend their time shrinking heads.To do it, he develops a plan to bring his steamboat to one of the most isolated rivers and schlepp rubber from one point to another, saving enough time and labor to make the scheme profitable. I don't want to have to draw a map here, so you'll have to take my word for it that the big boat must be sailed up one river, hauled by hand over a mountain, and deposited in the river on the other side so that it can be deployed.He borrows money for the boat from a reckless rubber baron and from his own girl friend, an older but still succulent Claudia Cardinale, who runs a whorehouse in a minuscule port on the Amazon. The job gets done -- including the hefting of the huge boat over the mountain -- just as it was done by Werner Herzog and his crew while filming the scene. For complex reasons, the sweating red-faced natives set the boat free in the new river, it bumps and bangs its way down through impassable rapids, and winds up back where it started, a failure.Except that Kinski doesn't really seem to care that much about the collapse of his would-be logistical enterprise. He sells the boat and somehow comes into enough money to hire the opera company for this sail into nowhere. And there Kinski stands at the stern, about to sit in his plush upholstered chair, as pleased as punch, looking around at the passing wilderness as if expecting applause, enjoying every note of The Carmelites. I didn't think much of The Carmelites myself. I saw it performed in San Francisco and fell asleep halfway through. So did my companero, who began to snore loudly enough to begin attracting attention. A quick nudge brought him out of it. But neither of us were opera buffs or, to the extent that we enjoyed it, it was at about the same level as the red-faced bare asses, certainly not Fitcarraldo's.You may or may not like this movie but I can practically guarantee that you won't forget it easily.

","genre":"Adventure, Biography, Drama"},{"date":"31 August 2010","score":"","review":" Before committing yourself to this longish and sometimes static film you ought to ask yourself a question. Do you feel lucky? No, wait. I meant, do you find this image enthralling, or -- let's not demand too much -- in any way interesting? It's the turn of the century in South America. There is this mammoth river steamboat, all beaten up and lopsided but still seaworthy. It's huffing along some river that you've never heard of in the upper reaches of the Amazon. A knot of Europeans stands on the muddy shore, waving and cheering, but you could sail up the river for hundreds of miles and encounter nobody but illiterate laborers and indigenous head hunters.Aboard this brave but decrepit boat an opera, The Carmelites, is being performed with a full orchestra and the entire cast. The only audience aboard the boat is a handful of silent, motionless Amazonian aborigines with their faces painted scarlet, who don't know what a drinking glass is, let alone what the champagne within it is supposed to be.On the upper deck, towards the stern, stands Klaus Kinski with a footlong cigar in his mouth, smiling proudly as he brings opera to the remoter regions of the earth. The aria rings out from the Italian orchestra and the tenor and is damped down and lost in the surrounding jungle.I only ask because that is the climactic scene in this outlandish and perplexing movie. And it's a happy ending, too.But, as you can see, it's not what anyone would call a typically Hollywood happy ending.Kinski is Fitzcarraldo -- the closest the native Amazonians can get to his real name, Fitzgerald -- and he's obsessed with Enrico Caruso and with opera in general. He's mad for opera in the most literal sense. And it's his responsibility, he feels, to bring opera to the unenlightened masses of bare asses who labor in the mud of isolated rubber plantations or spend their time shrinking heads.To do it, he develops a plan to bring his steamboat to one of the most isolated rivers and schlepp rubber from one point to another, saving enough time and labor to make the scheme profitable. I don't want to have to draw a map here, so you'll have to take my word for it that the big boat must be sailed up one river, hauled by hand over a mountain, and deposited in the river on the other side so that it can be deployed.He borrows money for the boat from a reckless rubber baron and from his own girl friend, an older but still succulent Claudia Cardinale, who runs a whorehouse in a minuscule port on the Amazon. The job gets done -- including the hefting of the huge boat over the mountain -- just as it was done by Werner Herzog and his crew while filming the scene. For complex reasons, the sweating red-faced natives set the boat free in the new river, it bumps and bangs its way down through impassable rapids, and winds up back where it started, a failure.Except that Kinski doesn't really seem to care that much about the collapse of his would-be logistical enterprise. He sells the boat and somehow comes into enough money to hire the opera company for this sail into nowhere. And there Kinski stands at the stern, about to sit in his plush upholstered chair, as pleased as punch, looking around at the passing wilderness as if expecting applause, enjoying every note of The Carmelites. I didn't think much of The Carmelites myself. I saw it performed in San Francisco and fell asleep halfway through. So did my companero, who began to snore loudly enough to begin attracting attention. A quick nudge brought him out of it. But neither of us were opera buffs or, to the extent that we enjoyed it, it was at about the same level as the red-faced bare asses, certainly not Fitcarraldo's.You may or may not like this movie but I can practically guarantee that you won't forget it easily. If you find that it piques your interest, take a whack at Herzog's Aguirre The Wrath of God. Both are set in the Amazon basin of history and both star Klaus Kinski as a lunatic. In Fitzcarraldo, he's a happy madman. In Aguirre, he's angry.

But I enjoyed this a lot more. A satire on the beach movies of the 50\/60's, combined with slasher movies, the film tells of a young girl who starts to hang with a group of beach kids, then starts getting black outs, just as some of the kids meet gruesome ends. Is she the murderer?...The film is very clever as it satirizes genre films, in a B-movie way, but without becoming too stupid or cheesy. There is a fine cast, many of whom have gone onto great things, Amy Adams for instance, and there is a fine performance from Lauren Ambrose (from 6ft Under) who plays the split personality Chicklet brilliantly. There is also a good performance from 'Neighbours' star Kimberley Davies.The recreation of the era looks fine and whilst the film never resorts to gross out humour or slapstick, there are some very funny moments, often from Charles Busch as the Police Captain Monica Stark or from two of the male characters gradual realization they are attracted to each other. The film starts quite slowly, but gathers momentum as it progresses and has a nice twist at the end. It reminded me a little of John Waters films, such as Serial Mom and Hairspray, it has much to enjoy in a camp, funny and slightly twisted way.More of reviews at iheartfilms.weebly.com ","genre":null},{"date":"31 August 2010","score":"","review":" Based on the stage play that was also written by Charles Busch, I was wary about this as I struggled with another of his films Die, Mommie, Die!

I personally like it, I can imagine though, that others dislike it.The thing that put me off the most have been the cuts. So many cuts have been plain bad. I don't actually get how this can happen to such a great director. The action scenes sucked almost every time. Often there have been several cuts in one second. But even in non-action scenes, stuff sometimes was cut too suddenly, and one scene didn't seem to fit to the other.Another problem for me has been the story. To me it seemed, that Wong had great and amazing ideas. Ideas that could have made a perfect movie. But he couldn't pull it off completely. This movie is full of great approaches, but somehow lacks the final cut. The characters motivations couldn't convince me, and I found the episodic stories not perfectly connected to each others. Usually Wongs movies impress and move me totally. This time I have been quite entertained, but rarely impressed and moved. Some other movies of his I'd rate with 10 points.
