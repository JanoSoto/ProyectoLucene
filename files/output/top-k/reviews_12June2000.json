It is simply one of the great films made in the past decade.  The criticism in which `The Insider' received was that it was not an original film.  It also been unfairly scrutinized by the media for it's `inaccurate' portrayal of the facts.  People often forget that the `The Insider' is not a recreation of a factual documentation of a story, but it is simply a film, it is the highest art of it's kind.What makes `The Insider' a masterpiece?  To answer this question, film lovers who would disagree with me, should watch the films of Howard Hawks. In both of the directors' films, they share an uncanny common parallel. They are masters of the physical aspect of the film making process.  Both directors believe that films must tell a story through the structural narrative drive, transitions of the images, cinematography, fluctuations in filmic rhythm, and especially the subtle execution of the realization of the film's thematic concerns.  All of these qualities are masterfully demonstrated in `The Insider.'In `The Insider' the film's ability to drive it's narrative, which it immeasurably serves to examine the character's psychological insight, makes it one of the great cinematic accomplishments in recent times.  This is the aspect of the film that causes people to denounce the film as `unoriginal.' Yet, `The Insider' serves it purpose by presenting it's narrative with a force that can't be produced in a thousand of these so-called `original' films made today.  `The Insider' is presented with candor and doesn't use any gimmicks to tell its story.`The Insider' is also one of the few films, in the tradition of Howard Hawks, as a film, which uses the aesthetic of oversight, of creating the mise en scene of implication rather than overly stating the film's thematic concerns.  Underneath the surfaces lie complex tensions between the character's pretense and their conscious feelings.  `The Insider' could have gone to great lengths of how smoking kills millions of people each year by showing an autopsy of a diseased lung or a demonstration of injecting nicotine on laboratory rats, but The Insdier is not a Spielberg film, it is a Michael Mann film.The photography of the film can also be described as momentous.  Dante Spinotti, arguably the best cinematographer today, executed the photography where it serves the film's purpose by fusing the image with tension and apprehension.  The most effective shot in `The Insider' is probably the close-up with the telephoto lens.  This shot effectively distorts the background, which gives the image an unclear tension, which infuses the moment.  The dull blue-green hues of the film also serve it purpose of creating an insomniac effect where the two characters are stuck in a nightmare in which they can't wake up from.With this film, along with `Heat,' proclaims Director Michael Mann as the best storyteller today.  Finally, the successor to Howard Hawks has been found.  ","genre":null},{"date":"12 June 2000","score":"","review":"  Michael Mann's `The Insider' is not a great film.  It is a masterpiece.

Especially if they're not sure they want to be a boy. Brandon (Hillary Swank) has a sexual identity problem. She's female, but she desperately wants to be a male. She cuts her hair short and picks up women in honkytonk bars in Lincoln, Nebraska as a way of dealing with her emotional problems. Of course, this sets her up for endless persecution by local rednecks (this movie does nothing to eliminate standard hillbilly\/small-town stereotypes), and poor Brandon Teena (or Teena Brandon, her real name) suffers tremendous mental and physical anguish at the hands of those less understanding.Brandon's travails take her to Falls City, where she meets Lana (Chloe Sevigny, late of Kids) and Candace (Alicia Goranson). Brandon hangs out with her new friends, who also include Tom (Brendan Sexton III) and John (Peter Sarsgaard). They drink, they party, they try to outrun the cops in a mid-70's Nova, and pretty much play the roles of Young People Gone Bad. How much you like these characters might depend on how much you identify with them - picture the gang from The Outsiders, for example. There's not much original in these amoral, hell-raising characters; they paint a pretty ugly picture of small-town people. Think your family has problems? Just about every vice and bad character trait is evident in these people, probably doing more to lower outsiders' opinions of rural America than any in any film in recent memory.Needless to say, Brandon doesn't tell anyone she's female right away, which means that in true Hollywood fashion, those very same people who she's come to know and trust - and yes, even love - aren't going to be as trusting when they find out she's female, rather than male. Haven't we seen that a few times before? She can't very well tell anyone right from the start, because then she runs the risk of their ridicule before they get a chance to know her. Ah, but this is a movie, even if it IS based on fact. So when she DOES have to tell them she's a girl, of course most of them react rather negatively. And because this is a stereotypical small town, they react violently, too. I think I saw this before, when the movie was called Frankenstein.Some of the persecution Brandon undergoes is a bit overdone, too - did we REALLY need a protracted, graphic rape scene? I realize that sometimes the audience needs to be shocked in order to be convinced of the character's appeal, but this scene occurred rather late in the film, and by then the audience really should be on the lead character's side.And that brings up another little issue - the motivation of Brandon. I do understand that this is a person (based on a real-life person, too) who is completely at odds with herself - she has the female parts, but longs to be male - and that conflict causes her to seek pleasure and pain simply to survive. But most of her problems in this film are brought on by her own actions. It's not as if Brandon is simply trying to fit in with the rest of the world - she actually pushes the envelope, almost challenging herself to survive, trying to see how far she can go before someone finds out. This isn't a story of someone with  a troubled past simply wanting to move on; this is a story of someone who's a little different than everyone else, and wants to challenge herself, who almost dares others to discover her secret.Don't misunderstand me - this is a fine film, but it has its bad points, too. The first three-quarters of the film are riveting, although sometimes tough to watch. But the last quarter descends into a standard movie-of-the-week treatment of a pretty serious subject, and generally every character becomes a caricature. I watched countless stereotypes and cliches walk across my screen during that last quarter. It's almost as if the screenwriters took an extended coffee break and someone from USA Networks filled in.Another problem is the casting. Hilary Swank turns in some magnificent work (and really deserved her Oscar), but her casting was puzzling, at least from a physical standpoint. When she cuts her hair short in her guy-disguise, that's about as male as she looks. For the bulk of the movie - in full guy-mode - she basically looks like someone's underfed sister. She's skinny and with a gigantic mouth. (And I saw her at the Oscars in female-mode - she's really VERY attractive.) To me, she really didn't look all that male - she just looked young. Now, I'm not sure what else the makers of this movie could have done to make Swank look more masculine, and of course this is based on a true story. Certainly, given the physical limitations of the role, Swank did a remarkable job.All in all, it's a good movie, thought-provoking at times.

She cuts her hair short and picks up women in honkytonk bars in Lincoln, Nebraska as a way of dealing with her emotional problems. Of course, this sets her up for endless persecution by local rednecks (this movie does nothing to eliminate standard hillbilly\/small-town stereotypes), and poor Brandon Teena (or Teena Brandon, her real name) suffers tremendous mental and physical anguish at the hands of those less understanding.Brandon's travails take her to Falls City, where she meets Lana (Chloe Sevigny, late of Kids) and Candace (Alicia Goranson). Brandon hangs out with her new friends, who also include Tom (Brendan Sexton III) and John (Peter Sarsgaard). They drink, they party, they try to outrun the cops in a mid-70's Nova, and pretty much play the roles of Young People Gone Bad.

There's not much original in these amoral, hell-raising characters; they paint a pretty ugly picture of small-town people. Think your family has problems? Just about every vice and bad character trait is evident in these people, probably doing more to lower outsiders' opinions of rural America than any in any film in recent memory.Needless to say, Brandon doesn't tell anyone she's female right away, which means that in true Hollywood fashion, those very same people who she's come to know and trust - and yes, even love - aren't going to be as trusting when they find out she's female, rather than male. Haven't we seen that a few times before? She can't very well tell anyone right from the start, because then she runs the risk of their ridicule before they get a chance to know her. Ah, but this is a movie, even if it IS based on fact. So when she DOES have to tell them she's a girl, of course most of them react rather negatively.

Both feature conventional noir plots - in this case a tale of love triangles, double-cross and a bungled heist - which are tinkered around a little chronologically.  Nothing too demanding - we catch our bearings early on; the shifts in time serve more to explain rather than complicate the present (although the titles indicating different times are hilariously inappropriate, referring to a vacuum) - compared to MURIEL say, this is a breeze.  Mercifully so, because the last third abandons chronological trickery altogether, and allows the beautiful plot mechanics to foreground themselves..Soderbergh, confusingly, has been called an extreme formalist and a realist.  Like Chabrol, he is both.  This film is exquisitely stylish, but the style is anchored in character.  The overlapping editing, the drenching of key scenes in dusky blue or green (very Sirk), the meaningful camera angles and movements, the distanced compositions alternating with privileged close-ups, are all beautiful in themselves, but also relate to the characters, the emotional lava bubbling under their impassive exteriors, their terror of repeating crippling past mistakes, their sense of paralysis, humiliation, wild desire; their increasing awareness of entrapment and betrayal; the underneath.The final third of UNDERNEATH, especially the hospital sequence, is as good as 90s cinema got, and is an expert fusion of style and emotion, an encapsulation of all the film's themes, about appearance and reality, the need for, and the failure of, communication.  Peter Gallagher comes into his own here, wiped off the screen, his charm and good looks obliterated, as if beginning yet again; but the past, as it invariably does throughout the film (and this is the real meaning of the time-switching), comes back to haunt him.The film is a remake of a classic Siodmak film noir, and despite its plausible modernity, is faithful to the genre, essaying the decline of a passive young man, who leaves his fortunes literally to chance.  Chambers just drifts through the film - any action he takes is negative and evasive, and he ends it crippled, vulnerable, prone, abandoned.  The nominal femme fatale, though, is anything but.  Soderbergh's analysis of relationships is always uncomfortably piercing, and he shows relationships destroyed, even at their seeming strongest, by solipsism.  After the mental and physical abuse she has suffered throughout and before the film, we cannot begrudge Rachel her final duplicity.Like THE LIMEY, though, and most of Soderbergh's films, UNDERNEATH's realism is questioned throughout.  On at least three crucial occasions, we find Gallagher asleep, and we must ask how much of the paranoia-soaked plot is dreamed, feared, remembered, fantasised by him; the ultimate loss of masculine control his gambling is only a symptom of.Of late, Soderbergh has become a great director of the American outdoors, but this film, set largely indoors, partakes of SEX, LIES AND VIDEOTAPE's claustrophobia.  This is in keeping with one of Soderbergh's main themes, the family, its potential as source of support in an alienating world, its reality as a metonym for corruption and betrayal.  The family relationships in this film are marked by rupture, corruption, abuse, neglect.  The one hopeful couple, Chambers' mother and his new boss, inspire such negative, humiliating Oedipal feelings, it's no wonder Chambers might dream of having him bumped off.  The frightening, enigmatic (self-cancelling?) final twist only compounds his irrelevance.

Both feature conventional noir plots - in this case a tale of love triangles, double-cross and a bungled heist - which are tinkered around a little chronologically.  Nothing too demanding - we catch our bearings early on; the shifts in time serve more to explain rather than complicate the present (although the titles indicating different times are hilariously inappropriate, referring to a vacuum) - compared to MURIEL say, this is a breeze.  Mercifully so, because the last third abandons chronological trickery altogether, and allows the beautiful plot mechanics to foreground themselves..Soderbergh, confusingly, has been called an extreme formalist and a realist.  Like Chabrol, he is both.  This film is exquisitely stylish, but the style is anchored in character.

It is often quoted that `My Daugter Clemitine' or `Gunfight at the O.K. Corral' were better movies.   In actual fact Tombstone was the most accurate description of the events that took place in Tombstone Arizona in 1880 &#150; 1882 then any movie before it.   A number of Hollywood liberties were taken with the myth but they were made in the interest of making the story more entertaining and broadly appealing then a serious lack of respect for the actual history. Kevin Jarre, the screenwriter, did a lot of research on the legend of Tombstone and the Earps involvement resulting in most of the main plot points being historically correct.The gunfight near the OK Corral was the most accurate put on screen.  If you use the trials - The Earps (Virg and Morgan did not attend because of their wounds) and Holliday were arrested two days after the fight - eye witness accounts plus local newspaper accounts following the event you would find that this was very close to the way that it actually happened.  It was also why they were found not guilty of murder.You will find compromises made to make it a more entertaining movie but even when doing so subtle things were done to increase the historical validity of the film.  For instance, Virgil and Morgan were not shot on the same night (a plot point combined to keep the film moving) but as an example of a subtle point related to the history &#150; Morgan's dog was at the scene of the shooting and was howling while he lay dying on the pool table (A newspaper article the next day described the scene of death and mentioned the loyal dog whining for his master).  There are tonnes of little subtle things done like this that point to the historical record of events.Another criticism is the relationship between Josie and Wyatt seemed to be direct Hollywood manipulation with the throwing in of a love interest. Again, this actually happened.  Tombstone is where Wyatt met Josie,  Johnny Behan was her original boyfriend, and Wyatt's relationship with her did add tension to the situation (Behan was a supporter of the Cowboys) and also complicated the troubles Wyatt had with Mattie during this period.   Also based on personal accounts about the kind of person Josie was, I felt Dana Delaney did a good job portraying Josie's personality accurately.Even some of the questionable events can be argued to be real.  For instance, in 1883 Johnny Ringo was found dead under an oak tree with a bullet wound to the head.  He didn't have his boots on and his gunbelt was on upside down.  It was of wide belief at the time that he committed suicide but some facts refute this.  The main of which is his wound did not show any signs (flash burns) one would normally find when holding a pistol to your head.  Ringo and Doc did hate each other and there were numerous accounts of run ins with each other while Doc was in Tombstone.  It is agreed that Doc often said he didn't want to die with his boots off (meaning while he was asleep) and with his TB wanted to go out with a blaze of glory.  Again, the subtle use of dialogue here is evident.  Doc's referral to `Daisy' which in those days meant `a person of high reputation' was used to communicate this thought.  At the Ok Corral one of the Clanton\/Mclaurys says `I have you now' and Val Kilmers response `You're a daisy if you do'.  After shooting Ringo he says `Your no daisy' referring to his disappointment in not being killed. So is Jarre incorrect in showing Doc Holliday as the killer of Johnny Ringo?  Maybe so, maybe not, but again you can see the attention to detail that lies just below the surface, with a thorough understanding of the facts that allows for some educated guesses around some of the more mysterious and unexplained events of the time.In terms of the facts, the only thing missing in my opinion is the under representation of the political undertones that existed in the 1880's Tombstone.  The representation of the &#145;cowboys' as a gang of criminals instead of a gang of democratic (political affiliation) ruralistic cattle herders who were maybe a little more grey then black in terms of crime, and their confrontation with the silver mining republican capitalists that Wyatt Earp was paid to protect.  These tensions (personified in number of political battles &#150; e.g. The Earps and Holliday were implicated by the Cowboys to be responsible for the killing of a stage driver in a botched hold up when the facts clearly showed that the Cowboys were behind it) were what ultimately led to the showdown near the OK Corral though the events of Ike Clanton from the night before were correct (Most of the participants in the gunfight did play poker the night before!)The bottom line is this is a good film with some excellent performances. It is in fact closer to the truth then many of its predecessors and is much better scripted movie then Wyatt Earp, which should have been a documentary. Kurt Russel's Wyatt Earp is dead on in retrospect to the facts given by people who knew him and Val Kilmers Doc is the best ever done.    The supporting cast is good at capturing the nature of their real life characters.  Despite what has been said about the ridiculousness of the moustaches and costumes, they were true to what was the fashion in 1880 - 1883 Tombstone.All in all, this is a fun filled entertaining movie that is closer to the truth then any other movie to come out of Hollywood on the subject.  In fact, this maybe why there are some Western fans who did not like this movie, maybe it was too much based on reality.

It is a nostalgic piece with leftist sensitivities, written by one who wishes he had been there.This is a well assembled but bloated ensemble piece, based on fact, that centers on the federal theater program of the mid 1930's.  This program was an outgrowth of the WPA from the depression years that gave federal funding to the arts to give employment to out of work actors, with the thinking that good theater would be good to boost the moral of the masses.  Unfortunately, Robbins was overly ambitious in this collage, attempting to weave together no less than four virtually unrelated stories.  The result is a whirlwind of disjointed jump cuts that distracts the viewer from the only engaging storyline, namely the production of Marc Blitzstein's play.  The disparate barrage of stories, assembled carefully to wax nostalgic about the leftist movement, had little appeal to anyone but those with a predilection to such waxing.  For everyone else, it just diluted the effectiveness of the main storyline, which is a pity because it was a good human interest story.That story shows a young Orson Welles directing a new play sympathetic to the labor movement.  The play and the federal theater program come under scrutiny of the U.S. Government.  The play is closed down on opening night and federal troops sent to barricade the doors of the theater, because the play is believed to have a communist message.  In a defiant act, Welles finds another theater and herds the audience from the front door of the garrisoned theater to the new one where the play is to be performed as a one man show by the author, the only man not in the union.  All the other actors are under orders not to perform lest they lose their jobs, a daunting thought in depression times.  The play goes on with a dramatic and uplifting twist at the end. The whole ensemble did a terrific job.  All the actors gave wonderful performances, though they needed to find someone with a voice better than Emily Watson's for the singing role.  Though I have been critical of John Turturro in the past (&#145;Illuminata' for instance) his was a standout performance in a very talented ensemble.  Ruben Blades was also terrific as the eccentric Diego Rivera.Overall, it was a decent effort at tackling a subject that simply no longer has an audience.  Robbins did a good job on the period props and sets, and the scenes brought forth frankly many of the real issues of the day (with a decidedly leftward slant).  But the film dissipates itself on irrelevant scenes designed to serve as a catharsis for every injustice Robbins saw in the times.  That jihad annuls some good performances by rendering the film a mediocre hodgepodge.I rated the film a 6\/10.  It had greater potential but flubbed it.  If you are a staunch conservative capitalist type, don't waste your time with this film.  It will just aggravate you.  If you long for the days of passionate liberal activism, you will love it, but if you are just looking for entertainment, you will probably be disappointed.

The film is beautifully told and is very touching and funny. The plot follows the women who made up a professional girls' baseball league during the second world war when the guys went fightin'. And then of course the war is over, and the guys come back - then what happens to the women with their glimpse of independence and a life outside the kitchen? There are lots of good character arcs, particularly the two sisters, Dottie (Geena Davis) and Kit (Lori Petty), and the washed up has-been, Jimmy Dugan, played by Tom Hanks with about 2 stone extra on him for the role.The flashback structure works so well you can't imagine doing it any other way. All the actors do a great job, but for me, Lori Petty as Kit, Dottie's kid sister, steals the show. She is brilliant. Watch out for occasional glimpses of Tea Leoni as a Racine hitter.Apparently all the injuries seen were sustained by the actors themselves. You can believe it too - they really look like ball players. First-rate editing makes it genuinely exciting sport. The film could have been a stinker - there are many cliches and it's pretty predictable, but it's handled with great sympathy and sentiment without treacle by Penny Marshall. Twists and subplots would have been out of place - this is a classic feelgood and entertains without dragging on.I give this 7 out of 10. On a rainy afternoon it's great entertainment.

First of all the the movie has a bad plot - oh save Naboo from the Trade Federation, this is obviously weaker compared to the establishment of a great evil force in the original trilogy.  George Lucas answered to Darth Vader with Darth Maul, who was a stupid character with an evil grin in red and black makeup.  Then there were the two lead charcters in Qui Gon and Obi Wan, I felt that there could of been some conflict here, and have taught us something more behind the ways of the Jedi.  But no, nothing good here altho I like both these actors they just had bad roles in a bad script.  Then there is the ever annoying and artificial charcter Jar Jar who weakens the movie considerably, and is just plain stupid.  C3PO and R2D2 makje a return but they suck.  The movie also has moments where you feel the flow is terrible, at parts the storyline is slow and boring, and added with the unecessary and childish pod race it feels like a cheap kids movie not bringing us the original qualities of episodes 4,5,& 6.  This movie lacked creative wisdom and more so any direction from George Lucas.  In all a terrible film that made millions, and didn't deserve a cent of it.  Go back to the drawing board George Lucas and lets hope Episode 2 is more thought out.
