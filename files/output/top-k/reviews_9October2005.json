Why does Hollywood insist on disrespecting us Brits when it comes to movies? Everybody knows (or at least, they should) that it was the Brits who recovered the German Enigma code-deciphering machine during the Second World War. Not that viewers of U-571 would know, of course, where the Enigma machine is found by Jon Bon Jovi and Harvey Keitel. The less said about the U.S. remakes of The Italian Job and The Avengers, the better and sadly, the trend continues with The Saint where a half-forgotten TV character from the Sixties is brought back to life and promptly crapped on.Val Kilmer takes the unlikely role of Simon Templar, an English public-schoolboy who grows up to be an international thief and mercenary for hire. He needs to take on one last job before he can retire and thus, he finds himself working for Russian politician Ivan Tretiak (Rade Serbedzija) and must recover a scientific formula for some energy thing called Cold Fusion. Leaping into action, Simon traces the theory back to beautiful Dr. Emma Russell (Elizabeth Shue) and before you can say conflict of interest, Simon falls for her and begins to protect her from the Russians who will stop at nothing to steal the formula for themselves.Before I start on the movie itself, allow me to revisit the point I made at the beginning. In the TV show, Templar is a gentleman thief and helps people with their problems for the Hell of it. He is not a gun-for-hire mercenary as he is here, obsessed with his bank balance instead of righting wrongs and making the world a better place out of the goodness of his heart. In short, this is The Saint in name only - it bears as much relation to the original show as I do to Brad Pitt (i.e. none). Kilmer is just dreadful, displaying all the grace and charm of a worm on a fish-hook. Disguises merely consist of differing amounts of fake facial hair and appalling accents and if spying is that easy then sign me up! There is little chemistry between Kilmer and Shue and neither are helped by the convoluted plot which seems determined to lose and confuse you at every opportunity. When you're not laughing at Kilmer, the action sequences are not too bad but again, this goes against the whole principal of the character. This could have been any film, with any character but instead of being an alright spy thriller, they attach the story to a character that simply doesn't belong there. It's a bit like making a romantic comedy with Hannibal Lecter as the principal lead.So where does this leave The Saint? It certainly belongs in the increasingly large pile of second-rate remakes along with Italian Job, Avengers, Dukes Of Hazzard and others. It's not even a good example of a spy film - stick with something like The Bourne Identity which does deviate from the source material but not in such a way as to disrupt the plausibility of the lead character or your enjoyment of the movie as a whole. I'm sorry but this film appears to have been massively over-rated on this website. Kilmer deserved his Razzie nomination - I felt like I was watching a feature-length episode of Allo, Allo but with more money spent on pyrotechnics. In all honesty, I cannot recommend this film to anybody. Perhaps those with no knowledge of the original might get something out of watching this but I mean no knowledge at all, whatsoever, not even the theme music! Sorry, folks but this Saint really is unforgivable. ","genre":null},{"date":"9 October 2005","score":"7 out of 12 people found the following review useful","review":" Here's a question.

Where the Dow fell 508 points or 22% in just one trading session a record at that time and, in some twenty years of record ups and downs on Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has never come even close to equal or break it. Trying to make it with the big boys on Wall Street young stock-broker Bud Fox, Charlie Sheen, has been leaving massages to his hero corporate raider Gordon Gekko's, Michael Douglas,office every day for two months to get an interview with him. Working at a brokerage house on Wall Street is slowly draining Bud of his life and money with him going nowhere and having to worry every day if he's called into his boss' office and given his walking papers.Bud wants to be independent like the great Gordon Gekko and the only way he can do that is by having some of that Gekko charm rub off on him by being a member of his team. Getting the news from his dad Carl Fox, Martin Sheen, that the airline that he works for,and is the union president, Bluestar Air has won a suit filed against it. That gave Bud the opening that he needs to get in good with Gekko by giving him the vital information, before it becomes public, and thus make a big score by buying up blocks of shares of Bluestar Air before they shoot up with the news. It turned out to be the biggest mistake that Bud would ever make and in the end put him behind bars and caused his dad to end up in the hospital with a near-fatal heart attack as well as bar Bud from ever working in any capacity with money on Wall Sreet for the rest of his life. Straight out of the headlines of the Wall Street Boom and Bust years of the 1980's the movie Wall Street shows how people in high places of money and power just can't get enough of what they want that they'll go as far as ending up in a prison cell in order to get it. Gekko uses the naive and unsuspecting Bud Fox to do his dirty work by getting inside information and then buying and selling stock on it. Bud thus puts his head on the chopping block if caught with the clever Gekko in being left out of the loop to Bud's, and secretly Gekko's, criminal activities. We see in the movie the sheer cold-bloodiness and shrewdness in people like Gekko and his underhanded actions in them destroying companies and businesses without even the slightest feeling for the thousands of people who's lives that they destroy, financially, by doing it. Bud for his part as a major player, a 50 to 100 million dollar man, in the Gekko money stock and real estate empire has it made with all his dreams as a big time Wall Street money maker coming true. Bud at first lives and rubs shoulders with the rich and famous and most of all with those with power and influence. It's soon that Bud starts to feel a bit wheezy when he learns that his hero Gekko plans to engineer a corporate take-over of his dad's place of business Bluestar Air. Gekko tells Bud that he's doing it to save his dad's and all the Bluestar Air workers their jobs which was just the opposite of what Gekko planned for them and their company. Fine performances all around with and Academy Award going to Michael Douglas as best actor as the greedy and charming Gordon Gekko styled after the Mad Russian of Wall Street Ivan Boesky. Gekko seemed to be at first a hard driving but decent guy who rewards his friends and destroys his enemies but in the end a lowlife snake in the grass who'll sell you out as fast as he'll buy out your business and turn it into a junk heap if he feels he can turn a profit on it. Charlie Sheen as Bud Fox is perfect as the up and coming Wall Street Whiz Kid who's being used by his mentor, Gordon Gekko, to make the big bucks and then, if the time comes, take the fall for him. Classy Daryl Hanna as Darien Taylor is both Gekko's mistress and Bud's live-in girlfriend without him, Bud, knowing that his hero, Gekko, is not only setting him up for a fall but screwing his girl behind his back as well. Martain Sheen is also perfect as Bud's dad, he is in real life, and the person who put his star struck and confused son straight on what Gekko's intentions really are and not to fall for his line of BS about caring for the working people of America.There's also Terence Stamp as Sir Larry Wildman Gekko's biggest rival on the street who together with Gekko makes the world of corporate raiders look like the dog-eat-dog world that it really was back then in the 1980's and even now A world where human feelings are as scarce as greed is plentifully.

Where the Dow fell 508 points or 22% in just one trading session a record at that time and, in some twenty years of record ups and downs on Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has never come even close to equal or break it. Trying to make it with the big boys on Wall Street young stock-broker Bud Fox, Charlie Sheen, has been leaving massages to his hero corporate raider Gordon Gekko's, Michael Douglas,office every day for two months to get an interview with him. Working at a brokerage house on Wall Street is slowly draining Bud of his life and money with him going nowhere and having to worry every day if he's called into his boss' office and given his walking papers.Bud wants to be independent like the great Gordon Gekko and the only way he can do that is by having some of that Gekko charm rub off on him by being a member of his team. Getting the news from his dad Carl Fox, Martin Sheen, that the airline that he works for,and is the union president, Bluestar Air has won a suit filed against it. That gave Bud the opening that he needs to get in good with Gekko by giving him the vital information, before it becomes public, and thus make a big score by buying up blocks of shares of Bluestar Air before they shoot up with the news. It turned out to be the biggest mistake that Bud would ever make and in the end put him behind bars and caused his dad to end up in the hospital with a near-fatal heart attack as well as bar Bud from ever working in any capacity with money on Wall Sreet for the rest of his life. Straight out of the headlines of the Wall Street Boom and Bust years of the 1980's the movie Wall Street shows how people in high places of money and power just can't get enough of what they want that they'll go as far as ending up in a prison cell in order to get it. Gekko uses the naive and unsuspecting Bud Fox to do his dirty work by getting inside information and then buying and selling stock on it. Bud thus puts his head on the chopping block if caught with the clever Gekko in being left out of the loop to Bud's, and secretly Gekko's, criminal activities. We see in the movie the sheer cold-bloodiness and shrewdness in people like Gekko and his underhanded actions in them destroying companies and businesses without even the slightest feeling for the thousands of people who's lives that they destroy, financially, by doing it. Bud for his part as a major player, a 50 to 100 million dollar man, in the Gekko money stock and real estate empire has it made with all his dreams as a big time Wall Street money maker coming true. Bud at first lives and rubs shoulders with the rich and famous and most of all with those with power and influence. It's soon that Bud starts to feel a bit wheezy when he learns that his hero Gekko plans to engineer a corporate take-over of his dad's place of business Bluestar Air. Gekko tells Bud that he's doing it to save his dad's and all the Bluestar Air workers their jobs which was just the opposite of what Gekko planned for them and their company. Fine performances all around with and Academy Award going to Michael Douglas as best actor as the greedy and charming Gordon Gekko styled after the Mad Russian of Wall Street Ivan Boesky. Gekko seemed to be at first a hard driving but decent guy who rewards his friends and destroys his enemies but in the end a lowlife snake in the grass who'll sell you out as fast as he'll buy out your business and turn it into a junk heap if he feels he can turn a profit on it. Charlie Sheen as Bud Fox is perfect as the up and coming Wall Street Whiz Kid who's being used by his mentor, Gordon Gekko, to make the big bucks and then, if the time comes, take the fall for him. Classy Daryl Hanna as Darien Taylor is both Gekko's mistress and Bud's live-in girlfriend without him, Bud, knowing that his hero, Gekko, is not only setting him up for a fall but screwing his girl behind his back as well. Martain Sheen is also perfect as Bud's dad, he is in real life, and the person who put his star struck and confused son straight on what Gekko's intentions really are and not to fall for his line of BS about caring for the working people of America.There's also Terence Stamp as Sir Larry Wildman Gekko's biggest rival on the street who together with Gekko makes the world of corporate raiders look like the dog-eat-dog world that it really was back then in the 1980's and even now A world where human feelings are as scarce as greed is plentifully.

Arsenic and Old Lace is a comedy the likes of which could only have been made before cinema audiences became as jaded as they are now. The comedy is pitch black - but it's pitch black in a nice humour sort of a way. These days, too many filmmakers seem to think that black comedy has to be really dark - but Frank Capra knew it doesn't, and this movie is the result. Here, we have a film that follows themes of poisoning, crime and insanity, but it's so fun to watch that you don't realise just how macabre the plot is. The whole film is played out with a great big smile on it's face - and although the plot just continues to get more and more complicated as the film progresses - the audience doesn't notice because it's so fun to watch. We follow Mortimer Brewster, a critic who, on his wedding day, finds out that his kindly old aunts are really homicidal maniacs that have killed twelve gentlemen already. One of his brothers thinks he's Teddy Roosevelt, and the other is a wanted criminal with a strange likeness to Boris Karloff...as Mortimer himself says, insanity doesn't run in his family - it practically gallops! The whole film is held together courtesy of a maestro performance from Cary Grant. Grant is an absolutely superb actor, and every single scene with him in is just mesmerising. The one where he finds out that his aunts have killed the man in the window box is one of the best Cary ever did. The way that he commands the screen is awesome and I really can't lump enough praise on this great, great actor! He is joined by a whole host of weird and wonderful characters. The fact that all these characters are in the film gives it free reign to basically do whatever it wants. The plot is easy to follow because the characters are so unique from one another, and really; they could all be just standing around watching paint dry and it would be funny! Speaking of the word 'funny' - this film epitomises it! Arsenic and Old Lace doesn't suffer from a single dull moment, and you could laugh at practically any moment in the film and you wouldn't be laughing at nothing. Many people think that great classics need substance to be remembered - but this one proves otherwise. Arsenic and Old Lace is a good time, plain and simple - and yet there's nobody that can argue that this isn't a masterpiece. See this film!

When I first started watching this, it seemed pretty good. The beginning was clever and funny, and I was really enjoying it... until the color began showing up. It was at that point the movie lost any sense of humor it might have had, and got increasingly garbled and pretentious.The idea of two teenagers bringing 90's values to a 50's sitcom is a good one, but director Gary Ross exposes his prejudice by making it clear he equates 50's television with 50's culture in general. As if he could be any more out of his league, he doesn't even seem to be familiar with 50's TV in the first place (what on earth is Pleasantville supposed to be a parody of, anyway? Leave it to Beaver wasn't NEARLY this bland).Back to the Future, a fantastic movie with a similar premise, was about a teenager discovering his parents were really not so different than him when he was young. Pleasantville is about two teenagers discovering their parents' generation was hopelessly backward and ignorant, and it is up to them to set things right. How mean-spirited is that!? Setting things right basically involves teaching everyone how to have sex, which didn't exist in the 50's, so by the time the movie ends the town has become a giant group orgy, although thankfully pregnancy still doesn't exist. I could hardly believe this was supposed to be taken seriously. Another user put it very well saying this movie is like Adam and Eve leaving a black and white Garden of Eden, only to go straight to a color heaven (an Islamic fundamentalist heaven, apparently).Skewed values aside, the movie is even more annoying because of its unnecessarily slow pace, and a plot that keeps getting sloppier and sloppier. Of course you're going to get people who say, It's just a metaphor; you can't pay too much attention to detail. Well, even a metaphor has to have some coherency. I'm referring specifically to the ending, where David goes home and Jennifer decides to stay in Pleasantville. Yes, if you haven't seen the movie and you're not sure if you read that correctly, let me say it again Jennifer decides to stay in Pleasantville. What is David going to tell his mom?? Where's Jennifer, honey? Oh, she got sucked into the TV set and decided to live in a sitcom. She probably won't be back. And like that's not weird enough, how exactly did he explain the situation to his Pleasantville mom? Mom, I'm not actually your son.

I think she took it remarkably well.I will say that it's worth watching for the mixture of black and white and color. I can't imagine how long it took them to edit all this. Scenes like hundreds of pink flower petals falling against a gray background are simply amazing. Visually, it's a great movie. If you watch it with the sound turned off and pretend it has no plot, I'd give it a 10\/10. Otherwise, it's a 4\/10 at best.

The tone in his voice is completely jerk-filled and you want to give him a high five every time he acts like the way he does. Through some well shot scenes, a good score and good acting, this movie managed to accurately display an exaggerated 80s Reagan era society. There are so many good lines that add to the cockiness of Bateman that it makes you smirk every time. I especially liked the dinner table scene where he talks about ending apartheid, world hunger, and stress less materialism, etc. but he obviously doesn't care about any of this. He just cares about being the epitome of knowledge...as well as looks, money, and being psychotic as well!I really don't see why the ending was such a problem for people. It's obvious it really happened. If it didn't, it would make the movie's message a complete failure. Why I think it really happened1. Everyone uses each other's names. Everyone looks the same. Therefore, there is much confusion to which each person really is. Paul Allen confuses Bateman for another character and it goes like this for everyone. Also, every man is cheating with everyone else's girlfriend. It creates this cycle of lost identity. 2. The detective says Bateman was at dinner, so he couldn't have killed Paul Allen at the end. Obviously this is another case of what I discussed in the first point. Stolen identity.3. The violence was another extension of the satire. To make it over the top and completely out of control indulgence, why not add murder to the mix? If Bateman can get away with anything because he's the king of everything, why not it be murder as well? It's a great mix really.I also do not get the book vs the movie comparison failures. Yes, this is a movie, so no, they can't devote a complete hour to discussing the band Genesis, only a segment. Lets cry about it. The movie wasn't as over the top, OK well, you again have only so much time in a movie. Also, lets not take into consideration the ratings that fly with this extra violence. To me, it is harder to accurately convey Bateman and his over the top behavior with less violence, yet this film achieved it. Don't get me wrong, I loved the book, but the movie is an adaption, and a perfect one at that. It is its own world.To top it off, the fact that Bateman couldn't cope with no consequences for his over the top actions was pretty great. Like many serial killers, they leave clues to try and get caught. What if you walked into the police office as one and they laughed in your face? From a serial killer point of view, I'm sure it would make your time a complete waste. So overall, his consumerism, materialism, intelligence, greed, murder, reached its climax and the only end result he would have liked was punishment, but now he has to live with this and he can't take it. He can't go any deeper with his escapades. I'm sure for a character like Bateman's, the only end would result in suicide so you would have to abruptly end this as did the book if you want to keep it going in the satire world.

","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"9 October 2005","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" This movie has it all. An atmosphere, great satire, violence, and replay value (for me anyways).The acting by Bale is superb of course. No one else could be casted for this role by a long shot. The tone in his voice is completely jerk-filled and you want to give him a high five every time he acts like the way he does. Through some well shot scenes, a good score and good acting, this movie managed to accurately display an exaggerated 80s Reagan era society. There are so many good lines that add to the cockiness of Bateman that it makes you smirk every time. I especially liked the dinner table scene where he talks about ending apartheid, world hunger, and stress less materialism, etc. but he obviously doesn't care about any of this. He just cares about being the epitome of knowledge...as well as looks, money, and being psychotic as well!I really don't see why the ending was such a problem for people. It's obvious it really happened. If it didn't, it would make the movie's message a complete failure. Why I think it really happened1. Everyone uses each other's names. Everyone looks the same. Therefore, there is much confusion to which each person really is. Paul Allen confuses Bateman for another character and it goes like this for everyone. Also, every man is cheating with everyone else's girlfriend. It creates this cycle of lost identity. 2. The detective says Bateman was at dinner, so he couldn't have killed Paul Allen at the end. Obviously this is another case of what I discussed in the first point. Stolen identity.3. The violence was another extension of the satire. To make it over the top and completely out of control indulgence, why not add murder to the mix? If Bateman can get away with anything because he's the king of everything, why not it be murder as well? It's a great mix really.I also do not get the book vs the movie comparison failures. Yes, this is a movie, so no, they can't devote a complete hour to discussing the band Genesis, only a segment. Lets cry about it. The movie wasn't as over the top, OK well, you again have only so much time in a movie. Also, lets not take into consideration the ratings that fly with this extra violence. To me, it is harder to accurately convey Bateman and his over the top behavior with less violence, yet this film achieved it. Don't get me wrong, I loved the book, but the movie is an adaption, and a perfect one at that. It is its own world.To top it off, the fact that Bateman couldn't cope with no consequences for his over the top actions was pretty great. Like many serial killers, they leave clues to try and get caught. What if you walked into the police office as one and they laughed in your face? From a serial killer point of view, I'm sure it would make your time a complete waste. So overall, his consumerism, materialism, intelligence, greed, murder, reached its climax and the only end result he would have liked was punishment, but now he has to live with this and he can't take it.

Some people even went further and said it was the best western ever made. But the raucous shoot-em-up Silverado came out that very same year, basically foisting Kevin Costner onto an unsuspecting world, and it ended up making a bigger splash in 1985 than did Pale Rider. Then, after that, two more things happened Costner went on to make Dances With Wolves (1990), and Eastwood went on to make The Unforgiven (1992), and with all that Pale Rider slipped into obscurity. The Unforgiven now wears the mantle of being Clint's masterpiece, his finest western, of being maybe the best western ever. And other people marvel much the same way at Dances With Wolves. Meanwhile, nobody thinks about or even remembers Pale Rider, a sorry fate that this fine film doesn't deserve.There are two distinctly remarkable things about Pale Rider On the one hand we have a return to The Stranger, the character Eastwood played in High Plains Drifter (1973). But, he's no longer called The Stranger, maybe because he has evolved in life, and he's now known as The Preacher. But he seems to be the same guy, at a different place in his life's journey. When you think about it, The Stranger from High Plains Drifter was pretty much just an Americanized presentation of the no-name character Eastwood played in the spaghetti western dollar series for Sergio Leone. And if you're going to categorize it, that's probably where this film belongs, as a part of that Sergio Leone series A Fistful of Dollars (1964), For a Few Dollars More (1965), and The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1967). Add High Plains Drifter and this, Pale Rider, into that mix and you have a complete set. And it's noteworthy that Eastwood never again returned to the character. Eastwood's The Stranger appears to be finito.All that's on the one hand. On the other hand we unmistakably see Eastwood using Pale Rider to pay homage to what was once regarded by many as being the finest western of all time, Shane (1953). In fact, it's more than mere homage that's being paid here. Pale Rider is really a full-blown retelling of Shane, updated, done in Eastwood's style, and with Eastwood's trademarked mystery man stepping into Alan Ladd's boots for the classic Shane role. Same story. Same plot dynamics. The biggest difference from Shane being that in Pale Rider the young lad is replaced by a blossoming adolescent ingénue, the gender change altering the tensions between the characters. Whereas in Shane the boy compared his father to Shane, and found his father lacking, in Pale Rider the girl competes heads up with her mother for The Preacher's attention. Another difference from Shane is that here the dirty deed is accomplished. Yes, Mama beds the manly stranger. In Shane's life and times the cowboy way was to resist that temptation --to rise above it-- and walk away. But here The Preacher takes off his boots and drops trousers. I suppose in Eastwood's view the world changed between 1953 and 1985. Of course one aspect of the story was fixed to make this acceptable. While in Shane Mama was ostensibly an otherwise happily married hausfrau, here she was a widow, unremarried, thereby rendering the tryst at least technically non-adulterous, although Mama was in a semi-committed relationship with her intended. But don't misunderstand. Pale Rider is a fine film. I like it a lot. I like it as much as Shane. I like it almost as much as The Unforgiven. It ought to be remembered. It deserves to be remembered.

It seems the place is dull and dead, and eventually the camera introduces the weeping Ewan McGregor, where he goes to sit at his typewriter and thus begins the story of his late love, Satine.It all starts in 1899, where McGregor's character, Christian, comes to Paris hoping to be a part of the Bohemian revolution sweeping the world. He dreams of becoming a writer, and has almost an obsession to write a story about love but realizes that he's never been in love.Seconds later, we are introduced to Toulouse Lautrec (played by John Leguizamo), and a few other men trying to write a show for the famous nightclub, the Moulin Rouge, and after hearing Christian's wonderful work, they form a plan to pass Christian off as a famous writer to write for the show, and was to show his work to Satine, played by Nicole Kidman, the Sparking Diamond, courtesan of the Moulin Rouge. After she approved of it, she would tell Harold Zidler, the ruler of the Moulin Rouge so Christian could write the show.That night, the group sneak into the Moulin Rouge and there's an accidental mix-up with the meeting of Christian and Satine, and the Duke and Satine, and magically, both Satine and Christian fall in true love, and for the rest of the movie, try to always keep their love together, no matter how much conflict gets in their way by being a courtesan, the jealous Duke, and the show for the Moulin Rouge...Opinions I don't want to spoil the ending and the conflicts in full detail but to say this movie is just a jewel is just an understatement. This movie directed by Baz Luherman, who also made his version of Romeo and Juliet with Romeo DiCaprio, has made another divine piece of work. This movie to note is a musical, and before I saw this movie, I never really cared much for a new taste in music, but after I saw the movie, I was astounded and fell in love with both Kidman's and McGregor's voices when they sang.The singing and choreography for the movie is close to perfect to set the mood of the movie, my most favorite the Roxanne Tango and the Elephant Love Medley. You can't find such imaginative movies like this these days.It's a fun, sad, suspenseful, and heart-breaking movie all in one. By the beginning of the movie, you feel you're going to have a fun time, and by the middle, you feel upset of all the conflicts invading the relationship with Kidman and McGregor, you can't help but nearly feel the same as they are on screen.

It seems the place is dull and dead, and eventually the camera introduces the weeping Ewan McGregor, where he goes to sit at his typewriter and thus begins the story of his late love, Satine.It all starts in 1899, where McGregor's character, Christian, comes to Paris hoping to be a part of the Bohemian revolution sweeping the world. He dreams of becoming a writer, and has almost an obsession to write a story about love but realizes that he's never been in love.Seconds later, we are introduced to Toulouse Lautrec (played by John Leguizamo), and a few other men trying to write a show for the famous nightclub, the Moulin Rouge, and after hearing Christian's wonderful work, they form a plan to pass Christian off as a famous writer to write for the show, and was to show his work to Satine, played by Nicole Kidman, the Sparking Diamond, courtesan of the Moulin Rouge. After she approved of it, she would tell Harold Zidler, the ruler of the Moulin Rouge so Christian could write the show.That night, the group sneak into the Moulin Rouge and there's an accidental mix-up with the meeting of Christian and Satine, and the Duke and Satine, and magically, both Satine and Christian fall in true love, and for the rest of the movie, try to always keep their love together, no matter how much conflict gets in their way by being a courtesan, the jealous Duke, and the show for the Moulin Rouge...Opinions I don't want to spoil the ending and the conflicts in full detail but to say this movie is just a jewel is just an understatement. This movie directed by Baz Luherman, who also made his version of Romeo and Juliet with Romeo DiCaprio, has made another divine piece of work. This movie to note is a musical, and before I saw this movie, I never really cared much for a new taste in music, but after I saw the movie, I was astounded and fell in love with both Kidman's and McGregor's voices when they sang.The singing and choreography for the movie is close to perfect to set the mood of the movie, my most favorite the Roxanne Tango and the Elephant Love Medley. You can't find such imaginative movies like this these days.It's a fun, sad, suspenseful, and heart-breaking movie all in one. By the beginning of the movie, you feel you're going to have a fun time, and by the middle, you feel upset of all the conflicts invading the relationship with Kidman and McGregor, you can't help but nearly feel the same as they are on screen.

The ambiguity and even anomie that overlap in the sequences of reality and fantasy must be structured by the viewer to reveal the various elements within this densely woven fabric of symbol and exploration. Firstly, the explicit plot poses the question of whether or not in the reality of an artist's narcissism there exist pure and true relationships, or are all beings in the artist's reality reduced to objects of his\/her intertwined creative and personal experience. This furnishes an overt storyline that is entertaining in and of itself, and illuminates the notorious egocentrism of an artist perpetually engaged in creativity and where beings in the environment audition for parts in the artist's personal life as well! Splendid! I am more impressed, however, with the psychoanalytic mechanisms used to drive this plot, specifically in the applications of transference and object relations. We see early on that Guido retains a yearning for the purity, innocence, and maternal qualities of his mother and the women of his early childhood. As he grew older, his own moral development was marked by the shame he internalized through his Catholic religiosity and his own perversion of the female image. This repression of guilt yielded his adult 'Madonna-whore complex' that is evident in his alternating fantasies of women seducing him and treating him as a child (recall that he was swaddled in a white sheet as a child by the nurturing maternal figures after the 'wine bath' (baptism by the Church?) but then also later in his harem fantasy by those who were also the sexual objects of his domination). This is also explicated in the dream where his mother transforms into his wife. As the script-writer criticizes, Guido is plainly pursing incredibly cliché figures (both maternal ones and also sensual) with his proposed female lead character. His aloofness of his own artistic quest mirrors the denial and aloofness of the quest in his personal life. His paternal explorations of guilt and avoidance, and the need for guidance all play out across his relationships with his father (in the dream), the producer, and the various representations of the Church. Ultimately, the viewer observes that Guido's creative enigma is perfectly intertwined with his psychodynamic neurosis, and his eventual catharsis is thus freeing for both dimensions of his life. An additional element Fellini incorporates is the repression, ambiguity, and ambivalence of Italy's national identity at the time of the film. Recovering from the postwar depression, dependence, and shame, and striving toward a new identity and place on the world stage, the nation's identification with the Catholic Church, and both modernism and the new world order led by the USA (as depicted by the panacea of Guido's securing the glamorous American actress Carla in the film) suggests that the fragmentation and complexity for Italy at the time may have paralleled that of Guido. As another viewer noted, does the ensemble at the end of the film also promote Italy's progression on the international stage if it too would benefit from introspection? Also, note the scene near the end when Guido and Carla dialog after emerging from the car, and Carla is revealed in full iconic significance she acknowledges his mystification of her while she stands before an automobile (American industrial might?) and the patterns of the street and perspective behind her appear to manifest an American flag! So much more one can say about such a spectacular piece of art that also stands as a timecapsule of its moment in history.

They arrive in Shinbone and go to a sparsely attended service. When prodded a bit by the editor of the Shinbone Star, a paper he was once employed at, Stewart sits down and tells the story of just how his political career got its start.The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance is John Ford's final homage to the western film genre that made his reputation. It's maybe the most nostalgic of westerns he ever did. Beginning with the cast all of whom are way too old for their parts. But if you notice there's a kind of soft focus photography used on John Wayne, James Stewart, and Lee Marvin which masks their age. The skill of these players does the rest.Stewart arrives in Shinbone, a newly minted attorney who has taken Horace Greeley's advice and the stagecoach he's riding on gets held up by the local outlaw Liberty Valance and henchmen. When Stewart protests Valance, played by Lee Marvin beats him with the butt end of a silver knob whip and leaves him on the road.He's found by John Wayne who brings him to Shinbone to get medical attention. Stewart stays with restaurant owners John Qualen and Jenanette Nolan and their daughter Vera Miles who's Wayne's girl. Miles who can't even read or write takes quite a shine to the educated easterner.But Stewart and newspaper editor Edmond O'Brien keep getting on Liberty Valance's bad side, especially when they come out publicly for statehood whereas the big cattle ranchers who hire Liberty Valance and henchmen want to keep this part of the USA a territory for as long as they can. This is all leading to an inevitable showdown.Lee Marvin as Liberty Valance is one evil man. No subtle psychology here, no explanations of a mom who didn't love him or a girl that dumped him, he's just an evil guy who likes being evil. If Liberty has any redeeming qualities, despite repeated viewings of this film, I haven't found any. Marvin clearly enjoyed this part, but he never turned it into a burlesque of himself. That he waited for Cat Ballou to do.John Wayne who by this time was playing more roughhewn types than he did when he was Ringo Kid in Stagecoach, gets back to that kind of a portrayal here. He's more Ringo than he is Ethan Edwards. But that's at the beginning. Over the course of the film he changes into something like Ethan Edwards, his character from The Searchers. What happens to make him that way in fact is the story of the film. But actually the film really does belong to Stewart. He's on screen for most of it, he's the protagonist here and until almost the end, what's happening to him is what The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance is all about. Ford once again rounds out his cast with many of his favorite players in support. Andy Devine as the cowardly marshal, John Carradine as a pompous windbag politician, Woody Strode, Denver Pyle, Strother Martin, all who had appeared in Ford films before.There are two to single out however. This was the last film Jack Pennick ever did with John Ford. You might not know his name, but he and that horse-face countenance appeared in just about every sound John Ford film there is. He has a bit role as a bartender. Pennick died after completing this film.Edmond O'Brien made his one and only appearance in this film as Dutton Peabody, founder, editor, and owner of the Shinbone Star and as he said himself, he sweeps the place out occasionally. He's a regular character in Ford films, the wise friend of the hero who has a bit of a drinking problem. Kind of like Thomas Mitchell as Doc Boone in Stagecoach. Like Stewart, O'Brien is an eastern immigrant who came west to be his own newspaper editor like his former boss Horace Greeley. Words are his weapons, like the law is Stewart's. It's no wonder that these two annoy Lee Marvin so. Even the fast draw hired gun can't kill public opinion. When they're both chosen as Shinbone's Delegates to the territorial convention it is O'Brien who makes the nominating speech to draft Stewart for the job. It is one of his finest bits in his long and distinguished career. It encapsulates a lot of what Ford was trying to say about progress and progress in the American west. In the end it is the farmer, the merchant, the builder of cities will eventually triumph just about anywhere. Stewart and he are as much pioneers as Wayne and the others in Shinbone are, they're just the next logical step.Progress always comes at a price. We see the price in the beginning and the end of the film, the scenes of Shinbone during the early Twentieth Century. The paved streets, the electric lights are there because of who came before and what they did. There wasn't room in the changing west for many like Wayne and Marvin, their time came and went, just as Stewart's time came and went too.Actually I think the real winner in this film was always Vera Miles. She started out as an illiterate girl working in her parent's restaurant and wound up the wife of a United States Senator. That's progress too.

There wasn't room in the changing west for many like Wayne and Marvin, their time came and went, just as Stewart's time came and went too.Actually I think the real winner in this film was always Vera Miles. She started out as an illiterate girl working in her parent's restaurant and wound up the wife of a United States Senator. That's progress too.

I found myself identifying with many of the characters in this movie.Many of them are trapped in a world of regret and mourning, due to a mistake that had been made early on in their lives.

Since then I've decided to try and find, if not buy, all of Miyazaki's films.Princess Mononoke is one of the most beautiful and well-done films I've ever seen in my life. I especially like Minnie Driver as the voice of Moro the wolf goddess, since I have a fondness for subtle, dignified voices. Lady Eboshi is one of my favorites in the fact that she's quite real; no matter how much people view her as a villain, all she really wants is for her people to be happy.It also helps that I'm an anime fan. Although I disliked seeing the battle scenes with the demons (I detest leech-like things) even they had redeeming qualities in my opinion; having been corrupted by hate, the gods have been transformed into monstrous beings. I say again, Princess Mononoke is a truly beautiful film.Miyazaki seems to have perfected the art of making characters human enough to be realistic. Unlike in Disney's movies, nobody is truly on one side or the other, and even Ashitaka, who can be deemed the 'hero,' is alternately for the forest and then for the humans. Truly a masterpiece that surpasses any work of Disney and Pixar put together.

And I don't mean just its artistic or technical side, but also its spiritual meanings. Of course, the story is great, the directing is great, the acting... Al Pacino, Keanu, Charlize. Oh, by the way, and I loved it how they had dissected the American myth of the successful lawyer (but it's much, much more that that). Anyway, back to my point remember that great scene when Milton explains almost literally the mechanisms of corruption and self-degradation, while walking in the streets with his young pupil? If it was only for that key for salvation in everyday life and the movie would have been a must see! Well, when I had left the cinema, I heard two guys commenting on it Wow, the system is so perfect, you can't get away. Exactly the opposite of my thought! And then I recalled the saying of the Revelation, which goes something like that he who is just, let him be just, and he who is corrupt, let him be corrupt. In other words, people had made their choices, the time has come. Well, are we really living the last days of our ripe world as we knew it or what? Very intriguing.

It's like a show business fairy tale the young director needed a hit, he had debts and Paramount commissioned him to direct a movie based on Mario Puzo's bestseller. Coppola hired a big forgotten star -Marlon Brando- and some young and relatively unknown actors -Pacino, Caan, Duvall and Diane Keaton. Federico Fellini's music composer (Nino Rota) wrote the soundtrack. The film was shot in Sicily, New York and California.

Coppola says that Godfather is a metaphorical vision of power in America... We can see this especially in Part Two, which is not just a sequel it's another chapter, where Coppola shows more contradictions in US society -Mafia's reign talks more and more with the other social and political institutions. (Martin Scorsese, for his Mafia's movies, chooses a more neurotic way of telling stories, whereas Coppola prefer a more classical style for his tales and likes to novelize the events.).The Godfather (1972) we know the Corleone's family and the way a clan keeps its power. There are rhythm, action, drama. And strong acting performances.The Godfather, Part Two (1974) the story goes on. A more bitter trip into the power and the loneliness of a Boss. The highlight is the combination of two parallel stories -Robert De Niro is the young Vito Corleone, and Al Pacino is the established Don Michael in the Sixties. It's the best sequel ever realized, maybe better than the original film.The Godfather, Part Three (1990) not as good as the two previous -actually it is much inferior to them, it was made too many years later. Some allusions to Italian mysteries (the death of businessman Roberto Calvi, the P2 lodge) are quite superficial. For the rest, the movie is well directed.
