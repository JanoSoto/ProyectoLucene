The hard bitten experienced local homicide detective is teamed up by his boss with the new-in-town FBI agent. First off, surely the cops wouldn't straight away have checked the FBI agent's credentials and discovered that in fact he was thought to have been burned up in a fire.The detective is asked to help with a particular murder suspect - which he promptly does, informing the FBI agent that the guy is in hospital and expected to die, which duly happens. You would think this would have been the end of the matter, but for some reason the detective then allows himself to continue to be used as a sidekick seemingly without good reason on a variety of other enquiries, starting with looking for a seriously ill guy who has suddenly gone missing from hospital. A quirky and interesting case yes, but hardly a priority for immediate homicide detective attention surely?But even when the body count is rapidly piling up, the detective seems to just accept that he isn't going to get any sensible answers about what is going on out of the FBI guy. Remember, this is a successful and experienced homicide detective we are talking about, surely he would be very experienced at questioning people effectively and would not allow himself to be fobbed off or his questions to just be evaded in this way.It isn't until quite late in the film and after going to about half a dozen murder scenes, and nearly getting killed himself, that he really tries to get to grips with things. 2. The ultimate weapon proves to be a flamethrower. The moment this was on screen in the police station early on in the film, being paraded for no good plot reason, I wondered when this was going to make an meaningful appearance in the film, and so it does near the end of the film. The good guy is under heavy fire but gets into position, gets out his flamethrower from a bag he is carrying and torches the bad guy. You would think the good guy wouldn't have been able to use the flamethrower long before someone exploded the thrower's gas tanks with a bullet, but conveniently everyone stops firing at the good guy while he uses his flame thrower. It has also to be asked, if the flamethrower was going to turn out to be this ultimate weapon, why oh why didn't the alien good guy think to use it earlier instead of trying to engage the bad guy throughout the film with a pistol which had as about as much effect as a pea shooter?Oh, and highly creepy ending too. The detective dies of bullet wounds in hospital, so the alien inside the FBI agent decides to jump bodies and then we see him at the end of the film trying to get the detective's daughter to accept that he really is okay as her dad, or something like that.That's creepy enough but goodness knows what the detective's wife will think when she finds out that her husband has had a total personality change; yet alone her horror and revulsion if she ever discovers that while her husband's body is still walking around, in fact he is dead and she is living and presumably sleeping with a stranger who also happens to be an alien and is controlling the functions of the dead body.

Their synergy builds a successful run for both along with the entire unit who treat each other like family. One fine day Eddie's ego gets the better of him and the entire unit crumbles with it. Their road to darkness and resurfacing to light forms the rest of the story.I hated Paul Thomas Anderson when I watched Magnolia.

Now, it's all up to Indiana to put an end to the Thuggee campaign, rescue the lost children, win the girl and conquer the Temple of Doom.I've heard that lots of people hated this movie for it's racially insensitive portrayal of India, it's much darker tone, it's camp value, and for being much too violent than the first film. Well, sure, Raiders of the Lost Ark was also violent, but the ripping out someone's heart scene in the temple halfway through the film was just too gruesome to even top the violence the original had. I'll admit that while the story isn't as well-thought out as the original, that doesn't stop the fact that the two sidekicks are the biggest flaw in the entire movie! Now, I don't hate the actor who later played Data in The Goonies, but he's annoying here because he shouts every single damn line at the top of his lungs. Willie, however, is much more annoying than Short Round as she contributed nothing to the story other than screaming and complaining which makes her the least compelling females in the franchise.With those flaws aside, it still has some redeeming qualities. The visuals are amazing, the cinematography is the epitome of excellence, the special effects are solid too, and the pacing is very brisk along with some efficient direction from Steven Spielberg. What stands out the most is the acting with Harrison Ford shining at his best with his role as Indy along with some great villains and it's cartoony, but terrific action sequences. The strongest aspect, however, is the music from John Williams and the comedy in some parts of the film.Overall, I understand the fact that people hated this movie, but despite the issues that I've already stated, this is still an entertaining follow-up to a great film if they can get over it's flaws.

Now, it's all up to Indiana to put an end to the Thuggee campaign, rescue the lost children, win the girl and conquer the Temple of Doom.I've heard that lots of people hated this movie for it's racially insensitive portrayal of India, it's much darker tone, it's camp value, and for being much too violent than the first film. Well, sure, Raiders of the Lost Ark was also violent, but the ripping out someone's heart scene in the temple halfway through the film was just too gruesome to even top the violence the original had. I'll admit that while the story isn't as well-thought out as the original, that doesn't stop the fact that the two sidekicks are the biggest flaw in the entire movie! Now, I don't hate the actor who later played Data in The Goonies, but he's annoying here because he shouts every single damn line at the top of his lungs. Willie, however, is much more annoying than Short Round as she contributed nothing to the story other than screaming and complaining which makes her the least compelling females in the franchise.With those flaws aside, it still has some redeeming qualities. The visuals are amazing, the cinematography is the epitome of excellence, the special effects are solid too, and the pacing is very brisk along with some efficient direction from Steven Spielberg. What stands out the most is the acting with Harrison Ford shining at his best with his role as Indy along with some great villains and it's cartoony, but terrific action sequences. The strongest aspect, however, is the music from John Williams and the comedy in some parts of the film.Overall, I understand the fact that people hated this movie, but despite the issues that I've already stated, this is still an entertaining follow-up to a great film if they can get over it's flaws.

Nonetheless, through a combination of front man David Byrne's charisma and stagecraft, Jonathan Demme's taut, precise filmmaking, and the infectious heat of the music, Stop Making Sense remains the most enthralling and sheerly entertaining rockshow ever. The keening melancholy of Heaven, the stripped-down mystery of Once in a Lifetime, the dark funk of Girlfriend is Better -- there's simply no duds here. And Byrne works his butt off. He seems to have energy to spare; during one number he simply jogs circles around the stage, as though he needs further exercise. His teammates Tina Weymouth, Chris Frantz, Jerry Harrison, and (eventually) a host of backup singers and musicians click into that energy without a stumble.This isn't raw work-- clearly this is a conceived film, with defined emotional beats and even a sort of intuitive narrative.

I've shown this film to at least three people who never heard of the band before (except through dim memory of early MTV), and even claimed to hate concert movies-- and then they went and bought the soundtrack.What can I further say?

Despite of being a mentally retarded person, Sam has a job working in a local Starbucks coffee store and has got friends with some what equal mental capacity. He's a sweet, good-natured, and loving father to Lucy that is equally attached to him.Unfortunately, a sordid twist of fate takes place in their paradise, at Lucy's 7th birthday a social worker believes that Sam, having the mental capacity of a 7-year-old, can't raise his child that is outgrowing him. Lucy is taken to a foster care temporarily as her father, along with the help of his mentally challenged friends, tries to find a high-profile attorney that can help him get his child back.After multiple attempts, Sam manages to appoint an attorney (Michelle Pfeiffer) who only takes the job at first as a dare. Rita Harrison (Michelle Pfeiffer) is a successful busy lawyer that comes home to a cheating man and a son who hates her, through the movie Sam and Rita develop a friendly relationship which is an eye-opening for Rita to value her family and be more involved in her son's life. Sam goes through a legal battle to retain custody of Lucy, aided by his mentally challenged friends, his agoraphobic neighbor Annie Cassell (Diana Wiest), and his high profile determined lawyer (Michelle Pfeiffer).The film is enriched with major cast members that in turn give out one of their best performances in their career life. Most noticeably, Sean Penn who initially visited L.A. Goal, a center in Los Angeles for mentally handicapped persons as groundwork to his role. I was truly impressed with Sean Penn's performance on the set of I Am Sam and how well he managed his role and his dedication to it as he freely indulged in the character of Sam Dawson. For anyone who has Sean Penn as a favourite actor, it's a must watch as it is easily his one of many remarkable performance and the stepping stone of his career. As for Michelle Pfeiffer, I wouldn't expect any other actress to perform the role of Rita Harrison as beautifully good as Michelle did. It's a perfect fit to her character and she accurately embodied the character of Rita that possesses an exhausted ill-tempered work driven nature. Least but not last, the amazing Dakota Fanning did a remarkable role on the set, and by far one of her best performances as a child.The movie is Beatles-themed as we first understand Sam's character as an impressive Beatles-knowledgeable person despite being retarded. He then names his child Lucy Diamond inspired from the Beatles song Lucy in the Diamond Sky. As a matter of fact, Michelle Pfeiffer's character is named after the song Lovely Rita by the Beatles and her surname is that of a Beatles member, George Harrison and if you noticed in the film, Rita Harrison(Michelle Pfeiffer) points that George Harrison was her favourite Beatle. In addition, the background music mainly consists of Beatles music and other Beatles songs covered by various artists for certain rights. The film is sweeping in its beauty, director Jessie Nelson did a great job in portraying her idea of I Am Sam into an absolutely wonderful movie especially after a 7 years of film directing drought. The cinematography is mostly hand-held work as the Camera is always close by to Sam for the obvious reason of picturing Sam's movement in a subjective sense allowing the viewer to actually feel with the character and pensively translate his actions. It's a closer look to the mentally handicapped people's world, that every act of their doing has an essence and that they are truly remarkable in their own special way.Lastly, should a intellectual deficiency restrain one from raising his own child? We've all had a grandma or grandma that despite of their intelligence in life aspects, had difficulty in helping their kids with their Geometry homework but does that alone hinder the child from having a well educated natural life? The movie has a great message, that when it comes to parenting, love is the most important thing and if that is present then it most certainly paves the way to a healthy parent-child relationship.

","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"22 September 2012","score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" If you're looking for a tear-jerking, emotion-provoking melodrama, this is your first on the list. I am Sam is a sensational dramatic piece that will leave you with tears to wipe. In the film, Sam Dawson (Sean Penn) is a mentally challenged single father who's left by, as what it seems, a one night stand homeless woman to raise his daughter Lucy(Dakota Fanning). Despite of being a mentally retarded person, Sam has a job working in a local Starbucks coffee store and has got friends with some what equal mental capacity. He's a sweet, good-natured, and loving father to Lucy that is equally attached to him.Unfortunately, a sordid twist of fate takes place in their paradise, at Lucy's 7th birthday a social worker believes that Sam, having the mental capacity of a 7-year-old, can't raise his child that is outgrowing him. Lucy is taken to a foster care temporarily as her father, along with the help of his mentally challenged friends, tries to find a high-profile attorney that can help him get his child back.After multiple attempts, Sam manages to appoint an attorney (Michelle Pfeiffer) who only takes the job at first as a dare. Rita Harrison (Michelle Pfeiffer) is a successful busy lawyer that comes home to a cheating man and a son who hates her, through the movie Sam and Rita develop a friendly relationship which is an eye-opening for Rita to value her family and be more involved in her son's life. Sam goes through a legal battle to retain custody of Lucy, aided by his mentally challenged friends, his agoraphobic neighbor Annie Cassell (Diana Wiest), and his high profile determined lawyer (Michelle Pfeiffer).The film is enriched with major cast members that in turn give out one of their best performances in their career life. Most noticeably, Sean Penn who initially visited L.A. Goal, a center in Los Angeles for mentally handicapped persons as groundwork to his role. I was truly impressed with Sean Penn's performance on the set of I Am Sam and how well he managed his role and his dedication to it as he freely indulged in the character of Sam Dawson. For anyone who has Sean Penn as a favourite actor, it's a must watch as it is easily his one of many remarkable performance and the stepping stone of his career. As for Michelle Pfeiffer, I wouldn't expect any other actress to perform the role of Rita Harrison as beautifully good as Michelle did. It's a perfect fit to her character and she accurately embodied the character of Rita that possesses an exhausted ill-tempered work driven nature. Least but not last, the amazing Dakota Fanning did a remarkable role on the set, and by far one of her best performances as a child.The movie is Beatles-themed as we first understand Sam's character as an impressive Beatles-knowledgeable person despite being retarded. He then names his child Lucy Diamond inspired from the Beatles song Lucy in the Diamond Sky. As a matter of fact, Michelle Pfeiffer's character is named after the song Lovely Rita by the Beatles and her surname is that of a Beatles member, George Harrison and if you noticed in the film, Rita Harrison(Michelle Pfeiffer) points that George Harrison was her favourite Beatle. In addition, the background music mainly consists of Beatles music and other Beatles songs covered by various artists for certain rights. The film is sweeping in its beauty, director Jessie Nelson did a great job in portraying her idea of I Am Sam into an absolutely wonderful movie especially after a 7 years of film directing drought. The cinematography is mostly hand-held work as the Camera is always close by to Sam for the obvious reason of picturing Sam's movement in a subjective sense allowing the viewer to actually feel with the character and pensively translate his actions.

It is a perfect case study for movie students with its highly structured screenplay, hardly any innovation or experimentation (theme maybe new for its time but my point is on execution), template characters and a highly predictable but a perfect end.Thelma (Geena Davis) and Louise (Susan Sarandon) are friends but leading un-fulfilling lives. One day they go on a weekend vacation where things go horribly wrong after a dreadful incident. When they realize they have nothing meaningful to go back to, they become fugitives suspected for a murder and decide to take the road to Mexico. New acquaintances, an obsessed police detective on pursuit and some amateur mistakes make them reachable by the had of law. Watch the movie to know if they surrender meekly or take the fight back to the law though most of you know what happened to them even if you had not seen it.Never a fan of Geena Davis but she is quite a charmer in this. Susan Sarandon is always a good actor and she sleepwalks through this template character. Though there were many other movies of a similar genre like Butch Cassidy..., Bonnie and Clyde etc, it fills the periodical slot for the insatiable demand for such movies by audience. It may have worked for the time, but I felt the dialogues, screenplay, background score etc felt too generic to stay back in my mind after watching the movie, though I loved the subtle camera work.Not a movie one would expect of Ridley Scott, but being a great talent he is - made this too look quite interesting.

I was unable to remember the band's real names during the radio contest scene. But to say this is a movie about Kiss and for it to be treated as a movie about Kiss is like saying Wayne's World was a movie about Alice Cooper, as you only see the band perform on stage for a few minutes out of the whole movie. No, this movie is about four boys who are die hard fans of Kiss and go to great lengths to finally see their heroes live. Overall, I found it entertaining enough for an evening of mindless movie watching. It helped that Eddie Furlong was cute as hell in this one. Like the lady in the It's Raining Men club, I also saw him as a perfect example of one of those teenage boys who will make an older woman want to get a hot young man's coming-of-age started on the right foot, lol. And if you watch the movie, you will see that the previous was an unintentional pun on what happens in the key scene between Eddie and that lady. If you want to laugh, watch this.

It's a badly plotted, overly talky mess with uneven effects, acting, and a tone which bounces back and forth from juvenile fantasy to sadistic thriller with stunning unease. Also I'm extremely biased, having been raised on this film and forgiving a lot that would turn a lot of people off, namely the kid-friendly design for Vincent and Bob.The Black Hole does stand out however with being one of the few expensive and fairly lavish films to present space not as an exciting arena for action but a cold and lonely place, populated by barely any humans at all. Also it deals with a lot of very adult and creepy subject matter, namely regarding the relationship between humans, robots, and cyborgs. It also deals with existential philosophy and the physics-bending reality of what bizarre powers could potentially exist in the universe. All this I really like but I have to admit is a lot to take in for most children.What young viewers may like is the large amount of tension and action all throughout the film. There's plenty of well-acted robots marching about the lonely corridors, and the atmosphere is well realized. I'd say Peter Ellenshaw's production design (especially that of the USS Cygnus) has to be 80% of the film and gives it a totally unique universe of its own. Major credit also has to go to John Barry, whose well-crafted and often-eerie music is spot-on with the exception of the overture, which I found a bit too bombastic to really fit the tone. Thankfully it only plays twice and later in the film.There's plenty to say about this film, but like most beautiful disasters I'd say to just try to watch with as open of a mind as possible. It's not nearly as exciting as STAR WARS nor as intelligent (or obtuse) as SOLARIS or 2001 A SPACE ODDYSEY but still a unique look at man's place in the universe, which is in my opinion what good sci fi is all about.

As an American it can be a little tough getting through the first few minutes and adjusting to the accents but other than that it is a great ride of a movie. ","genre":"Drama"}]
