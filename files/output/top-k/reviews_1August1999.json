[{"date":"1 August 1999","score":"","review":"  Matt Damon stars as Mike McDermott, a highly-skilled poker player that knows all the in's and out's of the game, insisting that its 'not a game of luck, but rather skill.' He frequents the many seedy bars and cleans up on naive, first time players, but one night he loses 'three stacks of high society' (30 grand) to the notorious Teddy KGB (John Malkovich), and resolves that enough is enough- no more gambling. That is, until his slimy friend Worm (excuse the pun Edward Norton) gets out of prison and reintroduces him back into the world of gambling.Slowly, the storyline develops and it is learnt that Worm is neck-deep in a fifteen-thousand dollar debt to Teddy KGB. Mike, between juggling law school and his girlfriend, vouches for Worm that the debt will be repayed. What follows are some intriguing, compelling and above all entertaining poker scenes. Its interesting to hear Mike use the poker player vernacular, saying things like I've got the wheel, and gimme three stacks of high society ($30000).Rounders is a very well acted, stylishly filmed movie. All the performances are very solid, notably Edward Norton as the infuriatingly arrogant Worm. Martin Landau, Gretchen Mol and John Turturro also make appearances, although John Turturro is criminally underused.Above all, Rounders is quite a different motion picture. If you can look beyond pervasive language and see the film underneath, then you won't be disappointed.Eight out of ten.

Although there are several moments of hilarity, overall the movie fails to succeed in capturing its goal - to criticize the value system of society while also making its audience laugh.  The first goal (and perhaps the most important in the creators' mind) is reached brilliantly.  Trey Parker and Matt Stone prove how truly f**ked up the American value system is.  They demonstrate how pure violence and sex is less censored than foul language which, unlike violence and (yes, even sometimes) sex, hurts no one.  This in itself is funny.  However, the actual movie in and of itself, regardless of its overall meaning, is not funny.  There are few really good laughs in this movie.  Many characters are unnecessary and undesired.  Most people who watch the show on a semi-regular basis will be dissapointed by the lack of comedy in this movie.  Some parts of this movie are just plain juvenile, and Kenny's character is misused.  Most people who leave the theater will realize that they remember little from the movie - there are just few memorable moments.  However, despite the fact that this movie is devoid of any truly memorable moments, people will ultimately remember its message.  *** out of *****    ","genre":null},{"date":"1 August 1999","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"   South Park - Bigger, Longer, & Uncut certainly had the ingredients and idea behind a potentially great movie, yet fell far short of its potential.
