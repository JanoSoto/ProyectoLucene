Watch his clips on Youtube. Avoid this film. That is, unless you want to gawk Jim Carey in Kaufman drag needlessly recreating Andy's gags for no particular reason.This film amounts to a ton of missed opportunities heaped upon a clueless screenplay and director.

But the same story? Nope. Not unless your television explodes and your garbage disposal eats your tie.The segments were pretty good. I enjoyed the Amazon Women on the Moon which was constantly interrupted by commercials (skits) and pointed to an great amount of amusement. The Video Pirates, while outdated, were funny. And so was the film critics judging that man's life.Some of the comedians in the film weren't as funny as I would hope. But the overall experience was good. So have at it. If you like 70s and 80s nonsensical humor, you will enjoy it. B+ ","genre":null},{"date":"2 September 2008","score":"","review":" In a crazy skit movie, you can't really try to find a common thread.
