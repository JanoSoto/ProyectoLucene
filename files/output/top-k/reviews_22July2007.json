The film is directed by John Frankenheimer, who previously made his mark on the thriller genre with the likes of The Manchurian Candidate and Seconds. 52 Pick Up doesn't exactly stand alongside those films as part of Frankenheimer's best work; but this film delivers an entertaining and easy to follow plot, fleshed out with interesting characters and a nicely sleazy atmosphere. We are introduced to Harry Mitchell; a war veteran turned successful businessman. Harry has been having an affair, and it soon transpires that three men have found out about it and decided that Harry has to pay them $105,000 or they will let the cat out of the bag to his wife, which will affect her political ambitions as well as put him in the dog house. But Harry has decided that he doesn't really want to give $105,000 of his money away to blackmailers, and so instead he tries to pit them against each other in the hope that the group will implode and save him from having to pay out.The plot we have here has a number of different sides to it, but it never feels overly complicated thanks to the way it usually just focuses on one or two points. The film remains interesting throughout thanks to this, and while the plot has a few problems; the fact that it's entertaining mostly ensures that these problems aren't too important. The film benefits from a good cast, which is headed by Roy Scheider in the lead role. Scheider gives a good performance and he suits his character well. The support cast is also good and features John Glover in the most interesting role, as well as the likes of Ann-Margret and Clarence Williams III, as a delightfully sadistic character. The plot points such as the snuff film and links to sex clubs ensure that the film has a heavy lining of sleaze, which is right on the money. The conclusion isn't all that inventive, but it works well within the context of the film and doesn't let the audience down.

But this classic is indeed a very good movie and the best way for me to honor it is writing about it as if it was any other film. However, it is important to note that, as other classics, we watch films like On the waterfront in a different way now.There are some moments in the movie where you feel like laughing (and sometimes you do), but you can be sure that when the filmmakers planned them, there was no intention of laugh whatsoever. So there is a mixed feeling of 'this is ridiculous' and 'this is powerful' at the same time when Father Barry (Karl Maden from The Streets of San Francisco, as my cousin Pancho pointed out) convincingly grabs a cigarette and puts it in his mouth&#133;But it's not a normal cigarette. It is said that screenwriter Budd Schulberg made a lot of research about the situation of the movie; workers who don't get all of their rights because the waterfront is controlled by the mob men, who walk around in expensive suits while some people don't get the chance to do their job. It is also said that Schulberg put lives of real individuals in his screenplay, which led to courtroom confrontations for the movie company after the film's success.In conclusion, On the waterfront made some noise on the real world, because it generated some decisions and changes about a problem and because it was clearly a well-made film. The way the characters are observed throughout the ride by Boris Kaufman's cinematography is the evidence of a work of variations. During some scenes where main character Terry (Marlon Brando) is talking to girlfriend Edie (Eva Marie Saint), the camera forgets close ups and watches the actors from far away, examining the whole background with detail; when Father Barry is speaking to the workers of the waterfront in what is probably the movie's most powerful scene, a camera shoots him from above at times, rejecting the obvious move that would be shooting the workers' faces. Of course that in scenes like these, the camera uses close ups and examines emotions, but not doing it all the time is an interesting detail. In the moments when it does examine characters, there's nothing better than Brando's expressions. In some ways, his approach to Terry is not so different from his Ken in The Men, because they both share a hidden story of redemption. It's like self-redemption due to the fact that they have to do things for themselves before proving anything to anyone else.That might not be the main aim of On the waterfront, but Brando sure makes it look that way. Playing two characters so related on the inside and making them different on the outside is something few actors can achieve&#133;Brando's power here is as strong as ever, but he's joined by a cast so strong that is difficult to say he is superior. His interpretation made me understand, finally, where Stallone took the inspiration for Rocky. It had to be from here; and you can analyze it as a great performance inspired by a great performance. The brutal honesty; the misunderstanding of the world around them is something that connects these two characters and many more...All of them iconic.The rest of the male cast is a growing delivery of emotions; going from Lee J. Cob as a horrific villain, through Rod Steiger's Charlie Malloy (Brando's character brother) and finishing in Maden's astonishing turn as Father Barry. Eva Marie Saint, in her first movie role, is not great by herself but is a better companion to Brando than say, Teresa Wright; and that's good enough.If I had to make one complaint, it would be one only and it definitely diminishes the quality of the film the score. I had the same feeling during The Men; where the score becomes louder than the characters' voices and, at times, is so exaggerated that it turns to something laughable. Composer Leonard Bernstein has done respected and interesting things, but the score of this film is not one of those.

The movie itself is a love story to cinema while serving as a memory of a time when going to the movies was a big deal. The film offers a collection of memorable characters of the Sicilian town of Giancaldo while focusing mainly on the relationship of theater projectionist Alfredo and Salvatore whom he calls Toto.The film opens with Salvatore learning Alfredo has died. He begins to reminisce about him and we are introduced to a nine year old Toto, being something of a thorn in Alfredo's side at the theater when he visits the projectionist booth during the town priest's regular screenings to cut out objectionable material, which just so happens to be any form of kissing. Here, Toto and Alfredo's relationship begins and later expands to a point when the nine year old learns to project. Having been surrounded by movies for a good portion of his life, Alfredo, being the Dumbledore to Harry, the Gandalf to Frodo, instills his wisdom into Toto using the movies- quoting American legends. When a tragedy leaves Alfredo blind the theater destroyed, Toto becomes the new projectionist when the nuovo Cinema paradiso opens.The film transitions to a 18 or 19 year old Salvatore, still called Toto by some of the townspeople. Alfredo is still there, but has stepped back from the projection booth, and instead becomes Toto's mentor. When Toto falls in love with Elena, in what becomes the most beautiful love story ever told on screen, Alfredo guides Salvatore in his effort to conquer her heart. The love story unfolds gracefully and becomes a pleasure to be engrossed in, but it ends abruptly and mysteriously. In the director's cut, it is learned the relationship was ended by a third party, in what he considered to be an act of love for Toto. Soon after, Toto leaves for Rome with advice from Alfredo to never come back and that if he does, not to visit him, he won't let him in. The film transitions to the third act after this.We find out Salvatore is now a famous film director and has come back to Giancaldo for the first time in 30 years for the funeral. During his visit, he finds out the Cinema Paradiso is to be demolished in a couple of days to make way for a new parking lot, almost as if the upcoming demolition was the last nail in Alfredo's coffin. After the funeral, Mr. Da Vita, as he is now called by the townspeople except for his mother, sister, former boss, and Signora Anna, at his insistence, he visits Signora Anna, Alfredo's widow who reveals to him that Alfredo loved him as a son and was very proud of his accomplishments. There, she gives him a film reel from Alfredo.In the final scene in what is presumed to be his screening room, Salvatore asks his projectionist to load the film and play it. In one of the most memorable montages in film history, Toto discovers the film is a compilation of all the obscene kissing Alfredo was forced to cut from the movies when he was the projectionist. Salvatore sits there, in his seat, tears streaming down his face, and realizes this to be the most profound act of love he has ever seen. The reel finished with a Fine and the credits start to roll, ending the finest film ever made.My props go to Tornatore for his excellent direction, particularly notable in the theater scenes. His screenplay manages to honor the movies with sentimentality, but he doesn't overdo it- it never becomes sappy and melodramatic. But my highest praise goes to legendary composer Ennio Morricone for what is the greatest score ever written.

The movie itself is a love story to cinema while serving as a memory of a time when going to the movies was a big deal. The film offers a collection of memorable characters of the Sicilian town of Giancaldo while focusing mainly on the relationship of theater projectionist Alfredo and Salvatore whom he calls Toto.The film opens with Salvatore learning Alfredo has died. He begins to reminisce about him and we are introduced to a nine year old Toto, being something of a thorn in Alfredo's side at the theater when he visits the projectionist booth during the town priest's regular screenings to cut out objectionable material, which just so happens to be any form of kissing. Here, Toto and Alfredo's relationship begins and later expands to a point when the nine year old learns to project. Having been surrounded by movies for a good portion of his life, Alfredo, being the Dumbledore to Harry, the Gandalf to Frodo, instills his wisdom into Toto using the movies- quoting American legends. When a tragedy leaves Alfredo blind the theater destroyed, Toto becomes the new projectionist when the nuovo Cinema paradiso opens.The film transitions to a 18 or 19 year old Salvatore, still called Toto by some of the townspeople. Alfredo is still there, but has stepped back from the projection booth, and instead becomes Toto's mentor. When Toto falls in love with Elena, in what becomes the most beautiful love story ever told on screen, Alfredo guides Salvatore in his effort to conquer her heart. The love story unfolds gracefully and becomes a pleasure to be engrossed in, but it ends abruptly and mysteriously. In the director's cut, it is learned the relationship was ended by a third party, in what he considered to be an act of love for Toto. Soon after, Toto leaves for Rome with advice from Alfredo to never come back and that if he does, not to visit him, he won't let him in. The film transitions to the third act after this.We find out Salvatore is now a famous film director and has come back to Giancaldo for the first time in 30 years for the funeral. During his visit, he finds out the Cinema Paradiso is to be demolished in a couple of days to make way for a new parking lot, almost as if the upcoming demolition was the last nail in Alfredo's coffin. After the funeral, Mr. Da Vita, as he is now called by the townspeople except for his mother, sister, former boss, and Signora Anna, at his insistence, he visits Signora Anna, Alfredo's widow who reveals to him that Alfredo loved him as a son and was very proud of his accomplishments. There, she gives him a film reel from Alfredo.In the final scene in what is presumed to be his screening room, Salvatore asks his projectionist to load the film and play it. In one of the most memorable montages in film history, Toto discovers the film is a compilation of all the obscene kissing Alfredo was forced to cut from the movies when he was the projectionist. Salvatore sits there, in his seat, tears streaming down his face, and realizes this to be the most profound act of love he has ever seen. The reel finished with a Fine and the credits start to roll, ending the finest film ever made.My props go to Tornatore for his excellent direction, particularly notable in the theater scenes. His screenplay manages to honor the movies with sentimentality, but he doesn't overdo it- it never becomes sappy and melodramatic. But my highest praise goes to legendary composer Ennio Morricone for what is the greatest score ever written.

Smacked in the middle is wall Street Buisnessman Patrick Bateman. He wears expensive suits, is pedantic about taking care of his body and constantly tries to get a reservation at the trendy restaurant Dorsia. But underneath the surface, Patrick Bateman is a shell. He may have flesh, blood skin and bone, but inside, he is simply not there. He describes hi,self only being able to feel two emotions, greed and disgust, two feelings which drive him to commit acts of gruesome violence in the night.Patrick Bateman is played perfectly by Christian Bale, who earlier had been in Empire of The Sun by Steven Spielberg. He gives the character depth and humor and gives excellent speeches, on one hand delivering sick remarks in ordinary conversations, and on the other recollecting careers of Pop-stars such as Huey Lewis and the News, Genesis and Whitney Houston. Patrick's equally shallow friends are played by Justin Theroux, Josh Lucas and Bill Sage among others. Patrick's supposed fiancée is played by Reese Witherspoon who does an annoying portrait of a woman who only cares about what people think of her. But she is supposed to be annoying, so it's okay. Cloe Sevigny plays Jean, Patrick secretary who has a crush on him. She is the only not shallow person in this story, which is probably why Patrick cant bring himself to kill her. Jared Leto also makes an appearance as Paul Allen, the only one of Patrick's acquaintances who can get a reservation at Dorsia.

But the film was just too predictable and had too many laughs where they were not supposed to be.I mean seriously. I can't speak for the crowds in 1960, but if anyone watches this for the first time today, it's pretty obvious where this entire picture is going after we go to the motel for the first time. The title itself is clue enough (he's a psycho after all) but really, I can't see anyone not guessing the big 'secret' of this flick way before the ending. The film's main characters are cast superbly. Janet Leigh looks great and sexy, keeping the film from being too boring because she's so beautiful and good on screen. And of course Anthony Perkins does a pretty decent job. He doesn't give the awe-inspiring heart-stopping performance that fans of the flick seem to think he gives, but he is very good indeed.The ingredients of the movie are put together very nicely, with the music and editing utilized for the maximum effect. Hitchcock definitely shows why he's known as such a great talent in these respects, putting it all together beautifully.Unfortunately, the film suffers from too many laughs where they aren't supposed to be. When Norman first indicated he's a little psycho, it's very funny watching him and his serious face as he gives clues he's such a nut case. With Mother, whenever she talks (and yells), it's just too funny not to laugh at it. Even the scene when Norman carries Mother form her room is funny, as she talks her nonsense as he carries her out with her legs dangling.And the shocking cellar scene almost plays like a comedy skit nowadays. When Mother is turned around in the chair, what you see just looks too funny not to laugh, and when Norman comes in, combined with his face, the way he was dressed, and the Psycho music at full bombast, I couldn't help but crack up for ten minutes at the hilarious combination of all this. Sorry to say, what was supposed to be such a frightening scene, is just too comedic to truly scare anymore.It's unreal to think Psycho was voted one of the scariest films ever made. Who does this movie actually scare?And the cop at the end, with his long-winded speech that sums up the whole picture (conveniently with the rest of the cast sitting and listening intently), is just too blatantly pandering that you just want to say, ok, I think we all get it now! You almost expect the cop to turn to the crowd in the theater and say, ok, does everyone understand now? Even the very last shot of Norman is kind of funny, with the expressions he is making. The skull kind of saves the scene, but still.Psycho is still recommended viewing for any old school movie fan, just to see Hitchcock's work. But the challenge is not to laugh at many certain scenes. The Making of documentary on the DVD is pretty decent (if not somewhat long winded itself) but the omission of deleted or rare scenes is definitely noticed. Janet Leigh is still very sharp though, and still looks great.

Everyone wakes up in the morning believing he\/she is the star of the movie, and that anyone who interferes with one's own personal agenda is in some way the enemy. Revenge plot films work particularly well if a person has low self-esteem. Rather than fighting back in the moment, the hero draws upon built-up inner anxiety to engage in a single act of power in an attempt to restore equilibrium. Quite naturally, in the real world this type of revenge seldom relieves the tension because life is not a movie; after the revenge is enacted the actions taken have their own consequences. A good revenge flick helps people ignore this bitter pill. In the movies the end credits roll and all responsibility resolved.Swimming With Sharks is advertised as a comedy, no doubt an act on the part of the producers to figure out just how to sell this oddity. It's dark, but it isn't dark comedy (Company Of Men and the works of Todd Solondz come much closer). Parts of the film are so brutal they pre-date the current torture-porn genre everyone is so obsessed with (Saw, Hostel). There are some laughs. There are laughs in Saving Private Ryan too, but it isn't labeled comedy.The intrinsic problem with this film is that it hasn't earned its revenge case. It is ostensibly about a young man who is abused by his boss and eventually takes his boss hostage to pay him back for all the mistreatment. The hero (aptly named Guy) is an everyman so vague we know literally nothing about him...what does he do with his spare time? Does he have friends\/family? How did he get where he is? What are his interests (this becomes a running motif through the film, no doubt inspired by the film's author's own struggle...What do you want?, the answer to which we are denied by a vague, cheat of an ending)? It's very difficult to care for such a character, even if acted well (even Tom Hanks becomes a creep in the wrong roll, such as Punchline). Kevin Spacey as the boss, Buddy, is supposed to be a monster but he's too charismatic as an actor. The best laughs came when he abused his assistant--he seemed almost as surprised as the audience probably is at what Guy will endure. When Kevin's character is being tortured, the view taken suddenly becomes empathy for him. Guy is suddenly filmed as a leering monster without rationality. At this point any message the author had has been lost; there's no hero in this film, ergo, no reason to care at all.It's not a stretch to assume this story is based on the author's own troubled career in the film business. I worked for a similar boss and can vouch that it's not that far-fetched. I had similar wish-fulfillment fantasies at that time and thought that I was justified. I thought you could win over the most beautiful woman in the story (actually, the ONLY woman--there seem to be all of about four people in the universe of this film) just by being your eager, naive self, that eagerness won accolades and that a boss abused you because he was a mean person. Time and tide have revealed the truth that most monsters are really just the demons of an individual's personal psyche and resentment is usually based in the self. As the film points out, if Guy was so unhappy he only had to leave. The film doesn't offer any denouement at all, surprise ending notwithstanding. We still know nothing about the protagonists, we can't even be sure anything they said was based in fact and everyone magically gets to have his cake and eat it too. In short, there was no point to this story at all other than to point out that (shock!) the film business can be pretty brutal.There are plenty of good films that tell solid and satisfying revenge-style fantasies, both the feel-good variety (9-to5, Working Girl, The Devil Wears Prada) and not so much (War Of The Roses, the remake of The Hills Have Eyes). This isn't one of them--despite a fun turn by Benicio Del Toro in the Emily Blunt role from Prada and some interesting work by Spacey and Michelle Forbes, this is a frustrating, mean, confused and slightly dull creation of self- indulgence from a director who has, one hopes, worked it all out by now...

There are laughs in Saving Private Ryan too, but it isn't labeled comedy.The intrinsic problem with this film is that it hasn't earned its revenge case. It is ostensibly about a young man who is abused by his boss and eventually takes his boss hostage to pay him back for all the mistreatment. The hero (aptly named Guy) is an everyman so vague we know literally nothing about him...what does he do with his spare time? Does he have friends\/family? How did he get where he is? What are his interests (this becomes a running motif through the film, no doubt inspired by the film's author's own struggle...What do you want?, the answer to which we are denied by a vague, cheat of an ending)? It's very difficult to care for such a character, even if acted well (even Tom Hanks becomes a creep in the wrong roll, such as Punchline). Kevin Spacey as the boss, Buddy, is supposed to be a monster but he's too charismatic as an actor. The best laughs came when he abused his assistant--he seemed almost as surprised as the audience probably is at what Guy will endure. When Kevin's character is being tortured, the view taken suddenly becomes empathy for him. Guy is suddenly filmed as a leering monster without rationality. At this point any message the author had has been lost; there's no hero in this film, ergo, no reason to care at all.It's not a stretch to assume this story is based on the author's own troubled career in the film business. I worked for a similar boss and can vouch that it's not that far-fetched. I had similar wish-fulfillment fantasies at that time and thought that I was justified. I thought you could win over the most beautiful woman in the story (actually, the ONLY woman--there seem to be all of about four people in the universe of this film) just by being your eager, naive self, that eagerness won accolades and that a boss abused you because he was a mean person. Time and tide have revealed the truth that most monsters are really just the demons of an individual's personal psyche and resentment is usually based in the self. As the film points out, if Guy was so unhappy he only had to leave. The film doesn't offer any denouement at all, surprise ending notwithstanding. We still know nothing about the protagonists, we can't even be sure anything they said was based in fact and everyone magically gets to have his cake and eat it too. In short, there was no point to this story at all other than to point out that (shock!) the film business can be pretty brutal.There are plenty of good films that tell solid and satisfying revenge-style fantasies, both the feel-good variety (9-to5, Working Girl, The Devil Wears Prada) and not so much (War Of The Roses, the remake of The Hills Have Eyes). This isn't one of them--despite a fun turn by Benicio Del Toro in the Emily Blunt role from Prada and some interesting work by Spacey and Michelle Forbes, this is a frustrating, mean, confused and slightly dull creation of self- indulgence from a director who has, one hopes, worked it all out by now...

But it is in that group of films with varied backgrounds (the HOME ALONE series for instance) where the grown-ups are easily out-witted by the children or high schoolers who confront them. Jeffrey Jones is Principal Ed Rooney. He runs a pretty taut, well run school, but there is one annoying fly in the ointment Senior high schooler Ferris Bueller (Matthew Broderick), who is extremely plausible and clever. Ferris understands the limits of the system Rooney dominates, and manipulates it. Ferris has a nice personality, so most people like and trust him. He certainly knows how to manipulate his two parents (Cindy Pickett and Lyman Ford) who are too busy in their business careers to pay sufficient attention to Ferris' activities. They feel he is a wonderful boy, which drives Ferris' sister Jeannie (Jennifer Grey) crazy. Both Jones and Grey want to catch Ferris in the act, the former to discredit him with the students who regard him as a role-model and hero, the latter to force her parents to realize what a phony he is.The plot of the film is simple. With about one or two months left before his graduation from high school, Ferris wants to take the last possible day of sick-leave off, but to do so with both his closest friend Cameron\/Cam Frye (Alan Ruck) and his girlfriend Sloane Peterson (Mia Sara). Make a real day of it in their home town (Chicago), doing all sorts of wonderful things. Cameron has health problems (usually dealing with his lousy home life - his parents hate each other, and his father is a car collector and restorer who loves his 1960 Mazzerati more than his wife or son). Ferris times a serious chest ailment of his own to occur on at the same time as Cam's absence. He sets it up using the electronic wizardry he has developed, complete with a fake Ferris covered up in bed who is snoring while sleeping, and a series of recorded messages linked to the intercom in his home for anyone (including Rooney) who tries to call him to the door. As for Sloane, Ferris manages to get her released from classes (and leave Rooney with egg on his face) for the sudden death of her grandmother. We gradually watch the next eight hours (until 600 P.M., when both his parents return home) unfurl, with Ferris, Cam, and Sloane going to a fine restaurant, going to an art museum, going to a Chicago Cubs game, and taking over a parade, while Rooney gradually manages to figure out he's been duped, but always finding himself not in command of the situation. He insults strangers who spit on him. He misses seeing the kids on a televised baseball game (he barely listens to what is going on in the game...or what the game is!). He runs afoul of a mean dog. His car is towed away. And Jeannie also discovers her suspicions about Ferris are correct, but she ends up arrested as a result of a phone call. The enjoyment of the day for Ferris, Sloane, and Cam is mixed - Cam's personal problems (which are symbolized by the Mazzerati) are too big for him to get away from...or seemingly so. And Ferris and Sloane are aware that they may not be able to maintain their romance after Ferris graduates.A clever film with good performances, FERRIS BUELLER'S DAY OFF really delivers. If I must choose my favorite performance it's a toss off between Jones and Broderick, but I may add that towards the end Charlie Sheen as a teenager arrested on a drug charge does quite nicely opposite Jennifer Grey. Certainly a worthy film comedy to watch...particularly on one's day off.

Sure enough, it wasn't.This movie gives pretentiousness an even worse name than it already had. It has the anarchic nihilism of an old Etonian in a punk outfit, the laughs of a Bob Hope routine, the outrageous pranks of South Park's Captain Kaos, the acting subtlety of an amateur pantomime, the philosophical depth of a fortune cookie, and the coherence of a William S. Burroughs cutup.And then there's the plot. It seems to consist of a number of separate unrelated ideas which are strung together into what is supposed to be a story, but with no obvious attempt at logical integration. A man is dissatisfied with his humdrum life. So of course he attends group therapy sessions for conditions he doesn't have. Then he meets his alter ego, Tyler Durden, who of course devotes his life to pulling unfunny satirical pranks. Then, naturally, they start fistfights with each other up for thrills. Witnesses see the obvious appeal of these fistfights and start joining in to form a secret nationwide movement. The movement understandably turns into an anti-consumerist terrorist cult financed by selling home-made soap. Finally Tyler Durden is revealed to be the protagonist's alternative personality whom the protagonist starts to fear and dislike, so he kills off his imaginary friend by shooting himself in the head, while managing to survive the injury himself. I kid you not, that is this film's pathetic excuse for a plot. Perhaps this is really just a clever satirical comment on the arbitrary nonsensical plots of Hollywood action movies. But that wouldn't make it any less lame.As if this nonsensical plot isn't tedious enough, the film-makers drag out its exposition, so that it has the length and pace of an Antonioni movie, despite the relentless action. It feels even longer than its already excessive 2 hours plus.I only rated it 3\/10 because I have seen worse movies that I still gave 2\/10. It probably deserves less. I realise that many somehow think this film is amazing. If so, it only proves that we have created a future where everything is amazing for 15 minutes.

I had heard about the cult status of this film, and the book it was based on, years before I saw it, though what little of the plot I knew about didn't make it seem terribly interesting. Sure enough, it wasn't.This movie gives pretentiousness an even worse name than it already had. It has the anarchic nihilism of an old Etonian in a punk outfit, the laughs of a Bob Hope routine, the outrageous pranks of South Park's Captain Kaos, the acting subtlety of an amateur pantomime, the philosophical depth of a fortune cookie, and the coherence of a William S. Burroughs cutup.And then there's the plot. It seems to consist of a number of separate unrelated ideas which are strung together into what is supposed to be a story, but with no obvious attempt at logical integration. A man is dissatisfied with his humdrum life. So of course he attends group therapy sessions for conditions he doesn't have. Then he meets his alter ego, Tyler Durden, who of course devotes his life to pulling unfunny satirical pranks. Then, naturally, they start fistfights with each other up for thrills. Witnesses see the obvious appeal of these fistfights and start joining in to form a secret nationwide movement.

Yet, I prefer the original version of Ridley Scott's BLADE RUNNER that features narration. Read as a flat monologue by Harrison Ford, the narration is relatively minor and it is bland and lacking any sense of humor or style. And though it does provide some fresh details, it really isn't dramatically necessary. Yet, the voice-over works, I think, because it is so banal; in a film that relies heavily on style and visuals, the narration's absence of any sense of poetry grounds the film. It contrasts with the overwhelming stylistics of the film as a whole. It gives us something real -- something human -- in an overcrowded world of eye-popping fantasy.Director Scott -- as well as Ford himself -- are on the record as not liking the narrated version and when Scott got the chance to have his say on a quasi-director's cut, the studio-imposed narration was the first thing to go. And while his version, without the intruding words, is more solemnly impressive, it is also more desolate and aloof. Without the narration, we observe the action in BLADE RUNNER from a safe distance; with the narration, Ford's Rick Deckard talks to us and forces us to be his confidante. And I think that is essential to appreciating the film because otherwise it is difficult to care one way or the other about the character or his fate. One-dimensional and unsympathetic, Deckard is not the film's hero -- indeed, he is anything but heroic -- but in the end, all depends on whether he lives or dies and the fact that he has shared his thoughts with us makes all the difference.BLADE RUNNER is a strange hybrid of genres, an odd melding of the traditional film noir, with its peculiar sense of pragmatic morality, and modern sci-fi, with its darkly pessimistic and persistent distrust of both humanity and scientific progress. There is also an element of the traditional western, and its romanticizing of masculinity and individuality. Deckard is a retired cop, drawn back into service by the proverbial one last case. He is a blade runner, a policeman by law, but in this dark and murky vision of the future (circa 2019), he is more of a hired assassin, in reality a gunslinger or bounty hunter. His job is to track down and retire a quartet of humanistic androids -- replicants -- who were genetically constructed to be slave labor on some off-planet space colony. Though they were created with built-in expiration dates and are fated to die soon anyway, the four have violently rebelled and have come to earth to try to force the corporation that created them to somehow extend their longevity.Though now considered a landmark of sci-fi cinema, BLADE RUNNER was a box office flop when it was released and was greeted with critical indifference. This is understandable; released about the same time as E.T. - THE EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL, and on the heels of STAR WARS and RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, the film represented a jarring difference in style and tone for audiences eager for upbeat sci-fi fantasy or thrilling matinée adventures. And this was especially true given the presence of Ford in the starring role; there is nary a trace of Indiana Jones or Han Solo in Deckard and though Ford plays the part well, it is with a dour lack of enthusiasm. Deckard has a job to do and one that he doesn't particularly like; that is the closest he comes to acting heroic. Indeed, in the end, what many may have found hard to appreciate, if they grasped it at all, is that Deckard is the film's villain, a man with no soul who seeks to kill others because they are deemed less than human.There are two other points of contention brought up by Scott's revisionist view One is his dislike for the film's so-called happy ending and the other his notion that Deckard is also a replicant (though Ford rejects this idea, insisting the character was always meant to be human). If Deckard is a replicant, the film gets an ironic twist at the end -- but it also robs the film of it's spiritual essence. The climatic moment of the story is when the last act of a dying replicant, Roy Batty, played by Rutger Hauer, is to save Deckard's life. If Batty saves Deckard because he senses he is a fellow replicant, it is an act of unity; but if he saves a human enemy, it is an act of forgiveness. As the narration explains, at death Batty loves life so much, he can't bare to take it from another. Batty receives redemption (and reveals he has a soul) by forgiving Deckard; Deckard's soul is reborn through Batty's generosity of spirit. And a beautifully ugly film about death becomes a film about the preciousness of life.The original ending, where Deckard and the replicant Rachel (Sean Young) flee to the country in the hopes of sharing a life, is optimistic, an underscoring of the idea of rebirth. It is vastly superior to Scott's preferred inconclusive ending, which suggests that the two are doomed fugitives. Though the studio-imposed happy ending was no doubt a purely commercial decision, it gives the film meaning in a way Scott's pessimism can't. Scott's vision of BLADE RUNNER is like a replicant, an engineering marvel and, like a machine, he assumes it is should run with cold, empty efficiency. But just as hope is what makes the replicants human, it is it's original message of hope that gives BLADE RUNNER its humanity.

I loved the way filmmakers Steven Spielberg and Tobe Hooper created a haunted house chiller in the normalcy of suburbia. It gets under your skin so much, it makes you dread ever opening an airing cupboard again. And its a film that's aged gracefully. Its just as scary as the first day I saw it 20 years ago.Then four years later, out popped Poltergeist 2 The Other Side, but this time without Spielberg or horror maestro Hooper present. And the change is definitely noticeable. Its not that Poltergeist 2 is bad. It just falls short of what made the original so great.After the chaos in Part 1, the Freeling family moved away from Cuesta Verde, and what was left of their haunted house. Now they've moved in with Diane Freeling's (JoBeth Williams) prescient mother, Gramma Jess. But when she passes away, the spirits now have a clear path to the Freelings, and in particular, their youngest daughter Carol-Anne. Once again haunting their new home, the Freelings have help from Taylor (Will Sampson), an Indian shaman, who holds the family together until their final confrontation with the evil spirits.Poltergeist 2 is a passable sequel, but it hardly generates the scare quotient the original did. Poltergeist was an exhilarating roller-coaster ride of thrills and chills. Pt 2 has few thrills. The man in the directors chair this time is Brian Gibson. I can't say that I've ever heard of him, and I'm sorry to say this, but he's no Spielberg.Some of the shocks he comes up with are a bit inventive. Like when the Freeling's son Robbie has a nasty encounter with his braces. It comes alive right in his mouth and entangles him like a gigantic spider web.But elsewhere the scares it whips up are way out there. In fact as the film draws to an end, the shocks start to get a bit too silly for their own good. Consider this one. Steve Freeling (Craig T Nelson) is drinking tequila. At the bottom of the bottle is an evil worm. When Steve accidentally ingests it, it takes him over. For a time he turns evil, going completely over the top, and then throws up a hideous ghoul (or Vomit Creature as its called on the credits). Its a scene of such startling idiocy its almost embarrassing to watch.The film's saving grace is its supporting cast. Taylor is a great character. Will Sampson does a brilliant job bringing him to life. You really feel safe knowing that he's around, and his pep talks to the Freelings are inspiring and filled with wisdom.But the one character that makes you sit up and take notice is Reverend Henry Kane (Julian Beck), the demonic preacher after Carol-Anne. He only gets a couple of scenes but whenever he's around, the hairs on the back of your neck immediately creep up. This fella is scary just to look at. Julian Beck was dying of stomach cancer at the time, and his illness actually adds to Beck's already impressive performance. He looks so cadaverous and chilling. And his silky voice intensifies his frightening appearance. The scene where he tries to hypnotise Steve into letting him in the house is terrifying.Jerry Goldsmith also turns in another great theme tune, especially in Kane's scenes. But having the words God is in His Holy Temple thudding on the soundtrack is a bit much. The film overdoes it too, to the point of tedium.The film also tries to answer the questions left hanging by the first one. But the plot is made up of many ill-fitting odds and ends that by the climax, I was no closer to working out the nature of these spirits or their intentions.The ending is vaguely unsatisfying. I didn't get the impression of a battle hard won. The film was trimmed down from 130 minutes, so I'm told. So I have to wonder what was left on the cutting room floor. It would be interesting to see it restored in a DVD special edition some day. Perhaps the film and the ending would be all the better for it.Poltergeist 2 is a film that suffered from severe editing. You can tell. You can't shake the impression you're watching an incomplete picture. And that's why the film doesn't work properly. Its watchable, but the haphazard structure undermines the film at key moments. And it just doesn't penetrate your defences the way Part 1 did. Its better than the dreadful Poltergeist 3, but its only a mildly unnerving haunted house show. Not the ride in pulse racing terror that it should have been.

For a time he turns evil, going completely over the top, and then throws up a hideous ghoul (or Vomit Creature as its called on the credits).

Will Sampson does a brilliant job bringing him to life. You really feel safe knowing that he's around, and his pep talks to the Freelings are inspiring and filled with wisdom.But the one character that makes you sit up and take notice is Reverend Henry Kane (Julian Beck), the demonic preacher after Carol-Anne. He only gets a couple of scenes but whenever he's around, the hairs on the back of your neck immediately creep up. This fella is scary just to look at. Julian Beck was dying of stomach cancer at the time, and his illness actually adds to Beck's already impressive performance. He looks so cadaverous and chilling. And his silky voice intensifies his frightening appearance. The scene where he tries to hypnotise Steve into letting him in the house is terrifying.Jerry Goldsmith also turns in another great theme tune, especially in Kane's scenes. But having the words God is in His Holy Temple thudding on the soundtrack is a bit much. The film overdoes it too, to the point of tedium.The film also tries to answer the questions left hanging by the first one.

I loved the way filmmakers Steven Spielberg and Tobe Hooper created a haunted house chiller in the normalcy of suburbia. It gets under your skin so much, it makes you dread ever opening an airing cupboard again. And its a film that's aged gracefully. Its just as scary as the first day I saw it 20 years ago.Then four years later, out popped Poltergeist 2 The Other Side, but this time without Spielberg or horror maestro Hooper present. And the change is definitely noticeable. Its not that Poltergeist 2 is bad. It just falls short of what made the original so great.After the chaos in Part 1, the Freeling family moved away from Cuesta Verde, and what was left of their haunted house. Now they've moved in with Diane Freeling's (JoBeth Williams) prescient mother, Gramma Jess. But when she passes away, the spirits now have a clear path to the Freelings, and in particular, their youngest daughter Carol-Anne. Once again haunting their new home, the Freelings have help from Taylor (Will Sampson), an Indian shaman, who holds the family together until their final confrontation with the evil spirits.Poltergeist 2 is a passable sequel, but it hardly generates the scare quotient the original did.

While no masterpiece, the central attraction of the original film is the morally ambiguous central figure. Outwardly a sophisticated metropolitan hero detective who always get his man and who presents an image of virtue and integrity, the real person is very different. Initially we buy into the image of hero, but the more we see how he operates in private the more we begin to doubt his moral integrity. Everything he does after we are initially introduced to him seems to cast further doubt on his character, and it seems that he is sinking into a quagmire partly of his own making. In the end a fortuitous events resolve matters, the crime is solved and the hero leaves town basking in the glory of another success. All the messy details are packed up and swept away. And so it is of great surprise that the Hollywood remake, like some nasty corporate censor, erases every single act which shows the protagonists moral slide downwards. First of all our expectations are dampened in the remake by making the protagonist not a hero cop, but a cop who is being investigated by internal affairs and sent into 'exile' for various misdeeds in the past. He seems a decent guy, but then his own partner says he is going to inform on him. He admits to out and out framing a criminal in at least one case. This it seems weighs heavily on his mind. This makes him a rather tarnished police officer. We are also not really given any indication of past heroism or why other police officers would look up to him. The original introduces the protagonist as an effective investigator as he takes charge, finds new clues, makes television broadcasts and so on. This is missing in the remake. He remarks as an aside that the murderer has washed the victims's hair, but it doesn't sink in. The introduction ends when the partner is shot and killed and we begin the moral descent.First we meet a rebellious stroppy teen who wants something 'exciting'. The protagonist gives her an extended and unpleasant grope before showing her the place where the body of her friend was found. In the remake this is deleted and the protagonist plays a game of chicken with an oncoming truck instead, which is stupid, out of character as well as pointless. Next we meet a dog that is destined to receive the substitute bullet. Our protagonist has killed his partner (by accident) and the bullet will eventually identify him. During a gun battle with the villain, our protagonist by chance finds the villains gun, something he keeps to himself. Having the villain's gun in his possession he shoots something with it, digs out the bullet and replaces it with the one the coroner found. The dog acts as substitute for a human gunshot victim. In the original the shooting of the dog is quite a gruesome episode. In the remake, the dog is already dead! It is a rotting corpse.As he descends further into the moral quagmire (symbolized by his battle with the sun and inability to sleep) he just about rapes the hotel receptionist. In the remake she has sex with him (which we are left to assume was pleasant and consensual) to stop him from disturbing his neighbours.And then the protagonist is dead! Villain and protagonist kill each other. The end! The original has a 'hollywood' ending where the villain is dead\/caught and everything is back to normal. But the remake removes the Hollywood ending and kills off the protagonist. The horror, the horror!The remake does have a few redeeming features. The scenery from Alaska is nice and the small town is well presented. The dash over the log filled pond is quite nice. Al Pacino as the protagonist is very good, as is Robin Williams as the villain. Al Pacino though is let to overact, when the protagonist should generally be more understated. The actress who plays the female rookie is also quite good.The action scenes also do not work in the remake, with the exception of the log chase scene. In the original the protagonist is almost killed in the chase scene. That is deleted. The cable car scene where the protagonist catches up with the villain is brilliant. No action is possible during the cable car and instead they have a 'quiet' chat.

I am sincerely not sure that such a film could have been made, due to Political Correctness which has infested the USA which means that any type of film dealing with the racial issue will automatically portray the bad guys as white and the good guys as black, or if indeed there is a bad black guy, there will always be another good one to contrast with this. So the race issue would have been best left out of this because as we all know, no race is free from killers and loonies and rapists.

The same goes for Samuel Jackson. Kevin Spacey, though, was brilliant and clearly audible in the role of the unrelenting procureur. On the other hand I was extremely annoyed by bleeding heart liberal Sandra Bullock ranting on against the death penalty and wondered what the point of having her in the film was. The more I see this woman in films, the less I like here - here characters are shallow and lack depth. She was out of place in this film, and apart from miraculously uncovering information about the state physician, contributed little to the proceedings. At least she was taught a lesson by the KKK, whose intervention on other levels seemed very violent and unpleasant - but I would have preferred the whole race aspect - KKK and all - to have been absent from the film. I am not sure in what period the film is set, and don't know how active the KKK is today. Anyway, these problems were dealt with far better in the film Mississippi Burning with Gene Hackman which was a great film. My main beef, though, remains the quality of the dialogues and the intelligibility of the speech which really was below par. I liked the happy ending and was pleased to see Matthew McConaughey and his family visiting Samuel Jackson.

I don't know if its one of the best but it doesn't matter since the film is simply good enough to simply demand your attention.The plot is simple enough, the course of a week during which a bunch of thugs take over restaurant and force its cook to prepare meals for them as proof of their good taste. Meanwhile the Thief's wife begins a clandestine affair with one of the other regulars, which is destined for a bad end.Clearly artificial and allegorical I'm hard pressed to tell you what the film is about really. I don't think it's possible to come up with a definite answer short of having director Peter Greenaway tell us, and even then I could argue that would be wrong. Why do I think that the film isn't about anything? because I've seen it at least a dozen times and its never once played out the same way for me. Sometimes its a wild comedy of manners, other times a horror film, others an allegory, yet another time its pretentious trash. Its all of these things and none of them. Greenaway gives us clues and references, from references to pieces of art, to changing color schemes, to biblical parallels to others that refer to Thatcher's England. The film is packed with ideas that aren't always clear, even when you've seen the film numerous times. The film is about everything and nothing, its one of the few Greenaway films that touches the heart as well as the head (we feel for the lovers), which says a great deal (Greenaway's films more often then not are intellectually exciting but emotionally cold). I think the film is a masterpiece and a touchstone for where the viewer is.Recommended whole heartily, with the proviso that the film has a graphic nature (violence and nudity) and is ultimately disturbing.
