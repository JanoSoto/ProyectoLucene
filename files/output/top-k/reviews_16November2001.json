I had read all the books not because I love that kind of book, but because I had a few long plane rides.  My attitude toward this whole Harry Potter phenomenon is that it's a great way to get kids to read; the books are fun, but I don't think any of it reason for excitement.  So the movie version, in my opinion, should bring something really special, after all it is a scapegoat from reading the books.  I was disappointed, however, to find that it was no more (nor less, mind) than it needed to be.  Director Chris Columbus, I am sure, was not an exciting choice for the producers.  He has no style to speak of, which is appropriate, but boring.  I don't expect the project to be handed to Darren Aronofsy, but it needed a little more magic, if you will, behind the camera.The effects were not disturbingly bad, but I for one am bored with computer effects.  Animatronics are getting better just as are cgi effects, so maybe a few more of those could have replaced some of the more obvious cgi's.The acting was fine, not great, except in the cases of Richard Harris as Dumbledore and the boy who played Draco Malfoy, the evil student.  Those two are examples of exceptional acting.The screenplay was generally loyal to the book.  But as in Most instances of a book translation to film, the occasional interesting subplot must be sacrificed and some elements and characters that were truly vivid in the book are cut down to become vague plot catalysts such as Hagrid's character and the whole Sorcerer's (or Philosopher's) Stone wrap up.Was I completely let down?  No.  It was a refresher course for the book since I read it a while ago.  But by no means should it be an alternative to the book.  I know kids are going to go ape poopy over it because there really isn't anything in it to let them down unless they are really snobby kids.  I was just disappointed because I'm a snobby viewer.

The trailer really worked for this film. I remember when I saw it, I thought it looked sooo funny, but the movie only made me crack a smile and a laugh here and there.The performances were kind of disappointing also. There really was no stand out performance in this film, except for maybe Julia Roberts, as usual. I really did not like Hank Azaria in this film. He does many very funny voices for The Simpsons, where he does accents and different voices and all, but his Spanish accent in this film sucked and only annoyed me. Catherine Zeta-Jones was annoying also. When she first became famous with The Mask of Zorro, The Haunting and Entrapment back in '98 & '99, I did not like her acting, she, well, sucked. She did, however, prove herself as a worthy actress with Traffic and I even thought she was robbed of at least an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress. And here she comes with America's Sweethearts and loses more points on her acting credit in my book. I guess because I thought her bossy, bitchy, self absorbed character was annoying.  So I really don't know what to think of her acting abilities as a whole.I'm a HUGE Julia Roberts fan so I mainly saw it for her because man is she a cutie and a great actress, I don't care what anyone says, she's a very good actress. And she didn't disappoint me. She looked cute throughout the whole movie and I liked her character, she did a really good job. I love her goofiness in these kinds of films and her body movements and just the overall way in which she presents herself I find to be very entertaining, because they are at least somewhat funny. I also like when she's angry and yells. I don't know why, but she yells good, especially the scene where she told John Cusack's character that it was her by the pool and not Gwen. And whenever she smiled, I caught myself smiling. You just can't help it. She's got a great smile. Billy Crystal was funny and the scene with him and the dog was one of the standout scenes in this flick. It's silly, but funny.I guess I've said a lot of negative and positive things about this movie, but it was okay, worth a 6\/10 because overall, I enjoyed it.
