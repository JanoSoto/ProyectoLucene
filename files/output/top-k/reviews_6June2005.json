On the day before the last game of the season Chapel learns that his one-time lover Jane Aubrey is leaving to go to London and the owner of the Tigers has sold them to a consortium that seek to trade Chapel to another team. Retirement seems the best option for him but he does love the game and doesn't feel ready to give it up just yet. These things weigh on his mind as he pitches against the Yankees and he thinks back over the career and life he has had up till this point.Short of adding another hour to the running time, you really couldn't lay the clichés any thicker on this film &#150; even the opening credits are the formulaic mix of home movies and sentimental memories. If you can accept that, then you still have another obstacle to get passed &#150; sentimentality. The whole two hours plus are spent wallowing in sentimentality in regards the present game, memories of baseball, memories of relationships and any other way it can wallow. For the majority it is very cloying but at times it shows what it could have done if it had managed to avoid these problem; occasionally the baseball game is enjoyable, occasionally the characters are realistic and their relationship interesting and engaging, occasionally the film isn't plodding. Occasionally. Sadly for the rest of it, the film does very little.The plot jumps between Billy's memories, meaning that they exist as fragmented parts of a story &#150; making them feel even more clichéd than they already were and preventing us seeing the characters develop over the time. This still could have almost worked if the film had avoided painting the whole thing with sentimentality but it doesn't; instead it runs deep through the film be it via the music used, the dialogue, the little speeches on the mound, lots of little things. Sadly it doesn't and it turns this Hollywood sports movie into the type of sentimental melodrama that clutters up the daytime TV schedules &#150; in fact this film had its UK television premier on a Saturday lunchtime. It is a classy daytime melodrama but it is a soapy melodrama nevertheless. Seeing that the director was Sam Rami, I was a bit surprised but then I suppose that this genre is hardly his forte.The cast can barely rise above the material although Costner comes the closest, hardly surprising since he has done this sort of role several times before. He is grizzled, does a far-off stare when he has to remember things and does look at home on the mound. He still can't do much in the face of so much sentimentality and he cannot carry the clunky lines he has to say, but he is good if you like him (although many people seem to dislike him). Preston is pretty poor and I think it is because her character is supposed to be a normal person and she can't do that. Reilly, Cox and Simmons make the support feel classy but none of them actually have anything to do. The cast might also have some real players, commentators etc but, like the vast majority of the world, I don't know any baseball celebrities and have no real interest.Overall this is a daytime television melodrama dressed up in expensive Hollywood clothes. Although it is quite enjoyable on this level, the plot is overflowing with clichés and the film is scripted, directed, scored and acted with sentimentality flowing from every pore. The end result is an average sports film that will be enjoyed by those seeking a cheesy melodrama but not many others.

Having not managed to finish his previous attempt at movie making with the short film Coven. Borrowing money left right and centre, Mark pulls together his cast and crew and begins pre-production with his friends and relatives giving support. However without good planning and management skills, Mark struggles to get things moving and doesn't seem entirely sure what he is doing other than doing a lot of talking in a production that seems as ambitious as the small town he lives in.I tuned into this film expecting to see a documentary about making a (very) low budget film but it quickly becomes a car crash of a movie that is less about that subject and more about just gawking at the white trash, small-town characters on display here. This is a shame because the latter would have been more interesting but it soon becomes evident that Mark isn't the sort of person we want to follow in such a story &#150; he is no visionary, he is no struggling artist and he is not creative. The fact that he is simply copying horror films he has seen before, without adding anything of value to it could have been used as a condemnation of the US film-making machine but it isn't. Instead we are just left to watch Mark talking a lot of air without substance, his family seem unbothered by anything, his friends mostly act stupid and stoned.Luckily this aspect of it is just about amusing enough to justify watching but it does get tiresome after a while. Mark is a character but he doesn't seem to realise that the audience are laughing at him rather than going along with him. He is a few steps away from trailer trash and I suppose he at least seems to be driven towards his dream &#150; but it would have been more interesting if this belief in an American Dream that many are mis-sold had been picked away at, but instead the film just lets him talk away. In fairness he has done OK out of it and he has had his dream of fame in terms of being mocked on Letterman for a while but other than that you do wonder what the point of the film was. Perhaps it is a real Jay & Silent Bob movie, which is all I could think as Mark and Mike bumbled around on screen.Overall, a documentary it is pointless and rather dull; it doesn't look at the making of a film very well at all, nor does it explore the idea of the American Dream (something it could easily and fascinatingly done). Instead it just watches the characters bumble around and, although the small town trash are amusing at points, they are not interesting or funny enough to fill the running time and even this gets boring before the end.

Nothing about the plot summary would lead you to expect anything other than a clichéd action movie and all that comes with it. And that is almost exactly what you get with this. The plot is predictable and really you are just watching it go through the motions and do just what you expect it to at almost every stage. The action is typically over-the-top and lacking the touch of realism that is usually needed to make it really engaging and exciting &#150; instead it is noisy and overblown, managing to be quite fun but certainly not gripping or involving. The character dynamics are also clichéd &#150; it is love\/hate, bantering, mismatched cops stuff but ironically it actually works pretty well. The main reason for this is that the script shows that at least Feldman wasn't taking it too seriously &#150; the dialogue allows both to mock each other and stops them settling into their macho images too much.Happily both Stallone and Russell buy into it and let themselves be made fun of as much as they get to give it. Neither are brilliant but at least they seem to have got the joke and avoid playing it too straight or just going along with the macho clichés. Of course they eventually get back to basics and (along with the film) eventually just gets down to big bangs and action movie traditions but for the majority of the film they just about do enough to make it fun &#150; albeit fun in a silly, rather guilty way. Hatcher doesn't add a great deal but it is interesting to see how good she looked then and how well she has aged in the past 15 or so years. Palance hams it up something awful and is a little painful to watch &#150; but he is matched by equally poor bad guys from James, Hong and a few others. Pollard does his usual stuff and is typical comic relief.Overall this is a dumb action movie and if you hate that type of film then you will hate this. I must admit that, by the end, the sheer cheesy stupidity of the whole thing had started to grate on me somewhat but up till that point it had been silly and quite fun.

The crew enjoy a couple of good kills and the profits are looking healthy but Ahab is driven by more than the love of money; crippled by an attack from a pure white whale years ago, Ahab wants revenge and desires to hunt it down and kill it. With news of a sighting, Ahab abandons the whale harvest and sets sail deeper into the ocean to catch his prey &#150; every step becoming more dangerous for the crew and has Ahab stepping further from his own sanity.With this version of the famous story, it is really hard to fault the effort because so much of it is good. That the story is an enjoyable chase, a tense nautical thriller and containing interesting characters is a given and the film tells it well here with a script that does manage to bring out a lot in a short time. The delivery of this tale is classy as well &#150; the effects may look less impressive with time but it is all convincing as being at sea and the work on the sets has paid off by producing the feel of being on the ship and not a soundstage. Like Jaws, the actual appearance of the creature is a weak spot in terms of looking like a rubbery cork but by then the film's real driver has had time enough to engage us &#150; that being Ahab's madness. The script brings it out well and the inevitable result of his senseless quest is given an almost biblical conclusion.However, I wasn't totally convinced that Peck was the man to deliver the character and in fact he himself was not that sure about his casting either &#150; but the studio apparently wanted a name. Despite this he does well but didn't convince me that he was this person &#150; just that he was really trying to be. It is hard to describe, but, although I enjoyed his performance, he wasn't as convincing as some other actors could have been &#150; Peck couldn't quite carry the bitter, senseless anger and madness deep into the core of his character, even if he did wear it on the surface. Basehart is also miscast, although fortunately he becomes less important as the film goes on. He is too old for the role and is not good enough to be our wide-eyed observer as he looks into the abyss that is Ahab's madness &#150; Basehart seemed too confident, too wise and a bit too much like he had already seen a bit of life. The support cast is good and has quite a few well-known faces; Welles is as imposing as ever, Justice is good in a very small role while Ledebur, Miles, Genn and others are strong in support.Overall this is a strong telling of the famous story. The direction is strong and it looks good &#150; with only the actual whales themselves looking rather dated and rubbery when exposed. The script does the story justice, producing tension as well as bringing out Ahab's madness well but, despite the mainly strong support cast, the main roles aren't as good as I would have liked, with neither Peck or Basehart fitting their roles as well as I would have liked, although both were still good.

A frighteningly convinced man gives a dread warning from a vision but Ishmael shrugs it off &#150; unaware that it is to be the first of many bad omens. The crew enjoy a couple of good kills and the profits are looking healthy but Ahab is driven by more than the love of money; crippled by an attack from a pure white whale years ago, Ahab wants revenge and desires to hunt it down and kill it. With news of a sighting, Ahab abandons the whale harvest and sets sail deeper into the ocean to catch his prey &#150; every step becoming more dangerous for the crew and has Ahab stepping further from his own sanity.With this version of the famous story, it is really hard to fault the effort because so much of it is good. That the story is an enjoyable chase, a tense nautical thriller and containing interesting characters is a given and the film tells it well here with a script that does manage to bring out a lot in a short time. The delivery of this tale is classy as well &#150; the effects may look less impressive with time but it is all convincing as being at sea and the work on the sets has paid off by producing the feel of being on the ship and not a soundstage. Like Jaws, the actual appearance of the creature is a weak spot in terms of looking like a rubbery cork but by then the film's real driver has had time enough to engage us &#150; that being Ahab's madness. The script brings it out well and the inevitable result of his senseless quest is given an almost biblical conclusion.However, I wasn't totally convinced that Peck was the man to deliver the character and in fact he himself was not that sure about his casting either &#150; but the studio apparently wanted a name. Despite this he does well but didn't convince me that he was this person &#150; just that he was really trying to be. It is hard to describe, but, although I enjoyed his performance, he wasn't as convincing as some other actors could have been &#150; Peck couldn't quite carry the bitter, senseless anger and madness deep into the core of his character, even if he did wear it on the surface. Basehart is also miscast, although fortunately he becomes less important as the film goes on. He is too old for the role and is not good enough to be our wide-eyed observer as he looks into the abyss that is Ahab's madness &#150; Basehart seemed too confident, too wise and a bit too much like he had already seen a bit of life. The support cast is good and has quite a few well-known faces; Welles is as imposing as ever, Justice is good in a very small role while Ledebur, Miles, Genn and others are strong in support.Overall this is a strong telling of the famous story.

However even coming to it with fresh eyes it still isn't anything special even if it is quite enjoyable for what it is. The plot is reasonably straightforward and takes the usual teenage outsider and angst and basically apes Carrie except with a group of girls rather than one.

Tunney is fairly bland and doesn't have a great deal of character (or little ability to bring one out), making a rather empty lead. She wore a wig for the whole film but it is her performance that doesn't convince as real. Balk overacts to good effect and is a lively alternative next to Tunney.

I first watched it on TV, missing the big screen effect of seeing it in a theater. The cinematography was well done, considering all of the problems that are inherent is trying to film a futuristic story among only four sets, that are essentially minimal in design. As far as my personal objections go, there are only two. The film took far too long to handle a rather simplistic subject -- the search for the dry land that so eluded everyone concerned. The other major fault is one of attitude. Costner is good looking and, almost always, is shown as quite handsome in his various roles. But, Costner seems able to play just one role -- Costner. He is a one-dimensional actor who is incapable of carrying any kind of accent for more than a single short sentence. Why doesn't he regularly employ a dialog coach when the role calls for it? He also never gives up anything about himself or the role particular role he is playing, no hint of inner being which could make a connection with the audience. The result, at least in this particular story, is that I had a very hard time generating any sympathy for him at all. I simply couldn't have cared less whether or not he found his dry land at all. This made for a really boring time, and I had to force myself to stay tuned for the entire excessive length of a story about a character that never got to first base. Too bad, because I think this subject could have been handled much better than it was. Another Costner excessive epic was The Postman, made a year or so later, which felt much to me like just another telling of the Water World story on a dry land locale. Both were Luke warm at best and way too long in length. Even Dances With Wolves (1991) had the same feel, and was only saved by the performances of the Lakota Sioux warriors and the breathtaking camera shots of the scenery.I would recommend both movies for watching as rentals, but only if there are no other choices available and you have a lot of time to kill.

Some have called this film a poor impersonation of Enemy of the State, but the cast from this movie is actually superior to that cast.Jamie Foxx plays Alvin Sanders, a typical New York City hustler type who runs afoul of the law without being violent. His main game is to steal large quantities of prawns (expensive shrimp) and sell them on the black market. He winds up busted by a guard dog and sent to prison, and that's where his troubles begin.Alvin's cellmate turns out to be Jasper, who dies of a heart attack during questioning about the heist of $42 million in gold from the US Treasury, in which a Treasury agent is murdered (otherwise, they wouldn't have gone to the trouble to catch him). Before he dies, Jasper confides in Alvin (in code) where the gold is, and the T-men realize that he can be used as bait to flush out the superhacker who thinks that he knows where the gold is.Alvin is clueless as to what's going on, but slowly comes to realize during the film that the killer wants him dead, and the government doesn't care if he dies in order for them to catch the Killer. To that extent, the movie uses the formula that The Firm did so well years earlier. Foxx's comedic talents greatly enhance his performance, and show once again (as John Candy did in Cool Runnings) that the proper use for a comedian in a major motion picture is to use his talent to add depth to a dramatic role.Jamie Foxx has won an Oscar for Ray since this movie came out, and is now on the A-list. David Morse went on to star in Hack on television and has impressive credentials all his own. The supporting cast is solid and you'll recognize most of them from their other work (such as Robert Pastorelli of Murphy Brown playing Jasper, or David Paymer, who also was good in Joe And Max on Showtime).When a bad movie takes itself too seriously, and pretends it's a good movie, it can be insufferable. Fortunately for the viewer, this movie takes itself seriously because it really is a good movie, well-acted, and with a cast that makes the most out of what it was given. Sure, the movie could have been better, but not by as much as one might think if they haven't seen it.The only thing I didn't like about the movie was Kimberly Elise as the stereotypical together single black mother who looks down on the very type of man she rushed into bed with to have her child.

I think that this film is one of the best I have ever seen. The direction in Stalag 17 was not noticeable enough to make a difference in how I felt about the movie; it seemed rather simple. The one thing I did notice about the direction was the length of the shots. This, in contrast to films that come out nowadays, was highly surprising. I do not know how many takes Wilder must have gone through to get everything the way he wanted, but with that volume of actors having to put together coherent lines in one take, it must have taken a long time. This does make the film better than if there were a lot of cuts back and forth, because being in a prisoner of war camp having fewer cuts lends to the monotony of the endless days of being in capture. Given this, I feel that the direction of this film fit the plot perfectly, and could not have been done any better.This film was filled with both drama and comedy, but was easily the funniest of the Wilder films we have watched so far. One character that I really enjoyed was Feldwebel Johann Sebastian Schulz, whom the prisoners simply referred to as Shultz. The fact that he was a German who was stationed at the prisoner of war camp lends the viewer to believe he will be a complete jerk. However, he comes of as hilarious and just doing his job. One line in this film that I really enjoyed was spoken directly to Schultz.Hey Schultz, sprechen Sie Deutsch?JaThen droppen Sie dead! Now, normally, a German working at a POW camp, upon hearing this directed at him, would go completely nuts and probably kill the prison who said this to him. In this case, however, good old Schultz jovially laughed and played along with the prisoner. This movie, unlike other early Wilder films, seemed a little far-fetched, and I do not believe that these people would act and converse in the way that they do in reality. At least, I do not think that the prisoners and the guards would interact in the way that they do in the film.One actor who really stood out in this film was William Holden. I am quickly becoming a huge fan of his, as I enjoyed him in Sunset Boulevard and even more so in Stalag 17. I love how upon finding out that Price is indeed the traitor in the camp, Holden's character, Sergeant J.J. Sefton, waits until the perfect time to let the cat out of the bag. Instead of just calling Price out on it right away, Sefton waits until it is most advantageous to him and his freedom to out Price. This was done very well. Also, I enjoyed the flashbacks of Sefton's antics, which included mouse races and a telescope to peep on the nude Russian girls. This was hilarious.As for the music, it fit the film well. It did not stand out as being out of place, which is always good. The special effects, though few and far between, were pretty bad. It was not believable that those people were actually being shot in the movie, but it does not distract from the film at all. The costuming and scenery was all very believable. I believed that I was watching events unfold in a German POW camp. Well done, Wilder!

The villains, although the spotlight is on both The Penguin and Catwoman, included a character created just for the sequel - Max Shreck, played by Christopher Walken, a corrupt mall chain owner bent on owning all of Gotham's electrical power.While the narrative managed to bring all 3 villains into the fold nicely, I felt that things could have been better if the focus was still kept on the main Bat villains. Since the villains again are the spotlight, I'll cover them first.Tim Burton's prints were everywhere in the creation of this version of the Penguin - a freak of nature, condemned to living in the sewers of Gotham while planning for his grand comeback to the real world, aided by Max Shreck. Again, the costume and makeup were until heavy wraps, and it was reported that Danny DeVito kept in character most of the time, hoping to beat his friend Jack Nicholson on the impact that this character could have on audiences. The Penguin's origin is one filled with, and ended in, tragedy. I remembered when this film came out, parents were up in arms against one of the scenes showing the Penguin spewing bile.Catwoman was changed too, as Frank Miller's Year One Selina Kyle was a hooker, which won't go down well with kids in audiences. Although some plot elements were not plausible, like Selina falling from a great height and brought to life by cats, the delivery was stylish, and Michelle Pfieffer oozed sensuality, vulnerability, yet tough as cookies, spunky attitude to Selina \/ Catwoman. The transformation scene with her making her own slinky costume and guzzling lots of milk was my favourite, and who could forget that kitty lick on the rooftop? Hot! (Not to mention that the costume was coming off and splitting along its seams as the movie progressed...) Credit to Burton though, while re-creating the villains origin, he kept iconic elements for each character intact, like the Top Hat, eye-glass, cigarette (on a holder), and gimmicky umbrellas for the Penguin, and Catwoman's whip and claws, although the narrative did not provide logical explanations on how she's trained on it (since she's a mousy secretary). Who cares though.Batman had a new costume with a proper logo. The look was sleeker, with chameleon-like abs. No qualms here though, as we know Batman has different costumes for separate occasions in the comics. Michael Keaton actually looked comfortable in the role. But still, the Batman killed. And that's a big no-no.With regards to the exploration of Bruce Wayne's love life, and falling for the villainess, this is my favourite amongst the 4 movies. Batman Returns had a strongest love story compared to the rest. The affections Bruce had for Selina even made him contemplate the notion (horrors!) of revealing his identity, and thoughts about giving up the mantle of the bat, just to be with her. (Ok, I know, in Batman Forever, he contemplated that too... more on that later) The theme of Duality took centerstage, as we saw all characters leading double lives, having to put on facades in the public, concealing their deepest darkest secrets and desires. The struggle with duality brought on a whole new meaning to the love lives of Bruce and Selina as well, and their revelation to each other on the dancefloor to the tune of Siouxee and the Banshees' Face to Face, and their reaction thereafter, was one of my favourite scenes in the movie.We began to see a glimmer of a strong partnership between Batman and Gordon in the film's beginning, but again, this was not exploited further. Given the plot, Gotham's Finest turned on the Batman, and it was fun to see him escape from the law.More toys were introduced (we still don't see where Batman gets his wonderful toys), and we saw the usage of the Bat-Glider (the stiffening of his cape), the good IL Batmobile being transformed into the Bat-missile, as well as the Bat-skiboat. The Penguin even had a mini-batmobile built, as well as a huge yellow Duck truck.Danny Elfman continued to score the movie, and brought in dark and separate themes for both The Penguin and Catwoman. The theme for Batman remained the same, though tweaked to highlight the movie's Christmassy setting. Only Face to Face made it into the soundtrack. No Prince or other artistes putting in music for this one.As a direct continuation from the first movie, we saw the use of the Bat-Signal. My gripe? Heck, Bruce Wayne is at home at night? He's the Batman, and on any night, he should be out there kicking the underworld's rear. He's proactive, obsessive, and obviously shouldn't have the Bat-Sginals mirrored in the rooftops of Wayne Manor.Batman Returns ended on a sad note, though with a flicker of hope that the Catwoman was still somewhere, somehow. Immediately after this movie, with Michelle Pfieffer's success in her role, word was out that a Catwoman spin-off might be in the works. Alas, what materialized was the disastrous Halle Berry effort.Many deemed this movie too dark, but in my opinion, this is one of the better Bat movies in terms of delivery, plot, and character motivation. It's unfortunate though, that this did not turn in expected returns at the box office.

They don't look like the average Hollywood production, but even though they are European, they can't really be compared to other European movies either, except for the English perhaps. The style of the French and English cinema aren't the same, but the subjects often are. Most of the time you'll get the story of people who have a hard time making the best of their lives, who live in poverty or bad conditions,... You'll not really find that as much in other countries like for instance Denmark, Spain, Italy,... in Asia or the USA.La Vie rêvée des anges or The Dreamlife of Angels, as it is called in English, tells the story of two young women, Marie and Isabelle, who meet each other in a sweatshop, where they have to operate sewing machines. Marie is apartment-sitting for a mother and her daughter who are in a hospital and in a coma after they had a terrible accident. Isabelle has been living with her backpack on her back, not knowing where she will end up the next day and sometimes selling handmade cards on street corners to earn a little money. Both have a difficult life and that's perhaps the only thing that really keeps both girls together. They find joy and adventure in one another's company, but sometimes also have incredible fights because their worlds are too far away from each other...If you are looking for a movie that will leave you with a good feeling after you've seen it, than you better start looking for another one. This film has a heavy subject and especially the ending will make you swallow a couple of times. I'm not going to tell you what that ending exactly is, but in my opinion it was the strongest part of the movie and one of the toughest, but also most touching endings I've seen in a movie in recent times. For me personally the rest of the story was certainly worth watching, but not always very original.

It was a 1982 book about a supernatural board game which puts the life of two children in jeopardy because of the unexpected (and also destructive) obstacles that come in the way. But these two pre-teens Judy and Peter are forced to continue until one of them reaches the circle at the centre of the board game, which will erase all the damages done-- all this done before their parents' return from the opera.A year later (February or March 1996), I went to see the movie of the same name twice. Needless to say, I saw that the film had some additional elements not found in the book. Judy and Peter play supporting roles in comparison with the book, but nevertheless important to the story. In 1869, two young chaps bury in a chest Jumanji, a board game who turns the players live in jeopardy. 100 years later Alan Parrish-- the main character played by Adam Hann-Byrd--, discovers the wooden board game outside of his father's factory in 1969, but knows nothing about its supernatural powers. Hours later he LITERALLY gets sucked inside the board game in front of his friend Sarah Wittle's eyes and events form that create an ugly future. Twenty six years later, Alan (now played by Robin Williams) resurfaces out of the jungles thanks to the help of Judy (Kirsten Dunst) and Peter (Bradley pierce)-- In the Jungle you must wait until the dice read five or eight; Peter rolled a five--, only to discover a chaotic 1995, where crime and corruption are rife and the environment resembles that of a war zone. In order to undo the damages caused by the board game, they must find the adult Sarah Wittle (Bonnie Hunt) and finish the game at any cost...Robin Williams delivers a very good performance of a compassionate man who also has wits of survival and his improvs work like a charm.

The Special Effects are very good and imaginative, and keep the movie upbeat and entertaining .

It was a 1982 book about a supernatural board game which puts the life of two children in jeopardy because of the unexpected (and also destructive) obstacles that come in the way. But these two pre-teens Judy and Peter are forced to continue until one of them reaches the circle at the centre of the board game, which will erase all the damages done-- all this done before their parents' return from the opera.A year later (February or March 1996), I went to see the movie of the same name twice. Needless to say, I saw that the film had some additional elements not found in the book. Judy and Peter play supporting roles in comparison with the book, but nevertheless important to the story. In 1869, two young chaps bury in a chest Jumanji, a board game who turns the players live in jeopardy. 100 years later Alan Parrish-- the main character played by Adam Hann-Byrd--, discovers the wooden board game outside of his father's factory in 1969, but knows nothing about its supernatural powers. Hours later he LITERALLY gets sucked inside the board game in front of his friend Sarah Wittle's eyes and events form that create an ugly future. Twenty six years later, Alan (now played by Robin Williams) resurfaces out of the jungles thanks to the help of Judy (Kirsten Dunst) and Peter (Bradley pierce)-- In the Jungle you must wait until the dice read five or eight; Peter rolled a five--, only to discover a chaotic 1995, where crime and corruption are rife and the environment resembles that of a war zone. In order to undo the damages caused by the board game, they must find the adult Sarah Wittle (Bonnie Hunt) and finish the game at any cost...Robin Williams delivers a very good performance of a compassionate man who also has wits of survival and his improvs work like a charm.
