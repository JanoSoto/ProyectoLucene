I suppose he had Ed (and there was a gay shout-out in Atlantic City), which brings me to Second of all, and the main flaw in the film Ed Norton's marvellous character takes over the plot; as soon as we watch him playing on his own, the movie becomes his story - and then when he just suddenly fades away at the end it's a total letdown.

Or those who prefer it to the 1968 version. The producers who wished to make a modern-day Romeo & Juliet just failed woefully. Only Leonardo DiCaprio seemed to stand out with his portrayal of Romeo (and that's because he's such good actor); isn't it a surprise that his 1968 predecessor is also named Leonard (Whiting)? But let's face it Claire Danes was so damned unconvincing as Juliet and very plain too. She is nowhere near the beautiful, talented Olivia Hussey, who wowed the audience with her performance as Juliet in 1968. No matter how you look at it, the part of Juliet doesn't fit her at all!Also, in the 1968 adaptation, Michael York made me admire the Tybalt character, as he portrayed him with a cool and calm grace that nearly made Tybalt a likable character (even though we know he isn't). Unfortunately, John Leguizamo's Tybalt was so downright irritating and annoying that he made him a whole lot more unpleasant than Shakespeare himself did. There are several issues I find appalling in this flick. In the first place, who says that Tybalt beats up Romeo when Romeo initially declines to fight him? Because Shakespeare definitely didn't. Secondly, when the bloke who plays Benvolio says Part, fools! Put up your swords; you know not what you do, I'm like Swords? What swords? They are using GUNS, not swords. Why doesn't he say Hey! Put your guns down!? That would have been more realistic.Thirdly, Harold Perrineau's Mercutio, unlike that of John McEnery, is simply brash. He doesn't have the wit. And the idea of dressing him up like a drag queen is simply disgusting.And finally, 4 crying out loud, who said Juliet woke up just before Romeo's death. Didn't the director read the story? I believe if Shakespeare got up from his grave and seen what they had done with his play, he'd call down GOD's curse on the script writers. In short, I was so disgusted with the movie that I wished I hadn't seen it at all. My brother who was watching it with me said he preferred it to the other one because it was modern. He is one of those who believe that the movies made from the 80s backwards (i. e. movies of the 80s, 70s, 60s, etc) are rubbish, but that's his opinion, not mine.Call me old-fashioned or whatever u like, but here's my verdict If u are looking for a Romeo & Juliet movie, LOOK FOR THE 1968 ADAPTATION!

If I remember correctly it was categorized as a thrillomedy. Despite it having a funny feel to it and having it being one upped by Eight Legged Freaks, this movie had some pretty creepy moments because I still don't like spiders. It started John Goodman and Jeff Daniels. This movie was awesome and I still watch it today. It had a b-movie plot, with an a movie budget, it had some very funny moments and some pretty creepy moments and of course there were some down right cheesy parts to it, but I can't stress how much of a thrill and experience this movie is for any horror fan or comedy guru.I want to first literate that this movie was supposed to be taken seriously as a horror but it gained even more fame and recognition as a thrill ride into a soft cushion. The spider effects, including giants spiders and webbed coated skeletons are cheesy, I know that, but give in mind there intention was to, I hope, make it have a b-movie feel to it. Despite that, you should look beyond that and notice how creepy they can make a felt spider or a puppet spider seem so creepy and intense (i.e. the shower scene and end scenes when the spiders crawl all over the house). However, if the spiders give you the creeps, this movie successfully makes a death seem funny, no matter how terrible it is. Coming from Frank Marshall who was a new director back then but later produced many favorable horror movies.I can't talk about this movie without talking about the humor and how well it is played into this film. There were so many hilarious things about this movie that I can't cram it into this one review. I would first off like to say that John Goodman is the funniest person in that whole show, and despite his low on-screen time, he steals the show. His monotone character fits with his performance and the way that he reacts to certain little things in the movie really makes me laugh. For an example, when he notices that the wood is rotting from the basement ceiling up, he asks if he can rip it out. Then happily says, You need better wood, not bad wood. Delbert is the funniest person there. Funny parts such as a blatant satire and parody on the shower scenes from Psycho when the spider comes out of the showerhead, which was funny! I'll go as far to say that the theme of the movie was hysterically put in just the right moments to lighten up the moment.Jeff Daniels, who is a very well known and well-respected actor, gets a chance to move away from a demanding drama role and away from the Farrelly Brothers and has some fun. In some way, he pokes fun at all of his dramatic rolls and acts a bit over the top at some of the best moments and surprisingly does a great job playing a guy who has arachnophobia, who now has to battle spiders. There were other great acting performances by Julian Sands, Stuart Pankin and Brian McNamara.All in all, this movie was a fantastic thrill ride that takes you to arachnophobia hell and back to hysterical bliss. The scares and the laughs are in abundance and both share an equal balance. The acting was perfect for a movie of this caliber and the special effects were a great tribute to b-movies of the 80s and 70s. I would highly recommend this movie to horror fans who like to take it light and not get scared as much, however, given the fact it is spiders, a lot of people share the condition that this movie is named. But, if you are truly a hard-core horror fan, than this movie is a must. If you have arachnophobia, I would not recommend this movie solely because you might inadvertently enhance your fear of spiders. I know it has for me.

That Aussie jerk ruined it from the first moment he appeared on screen. Whoever gave him the idea that he could act, that he understood the first thing about photography, that his croc hunter accent was somehow cool, or that his big fat ass was sexy and ought to be shoved in our faces for an hour and a half? If you're not a woman or hopelessly gay, a movie where beefcake men run around in thongs is what we used to call a real gross-out. Admittedly, there were a handful of scenes containing cute, half-naked babes that deserved a second look, but otherwise, this horrible excuse for cinema was a groan from start to finish, actually worse than a bad Loveboat episode, if that is possible. Rosie O'Donnel wasn't exactly good in it but she was far from its worst feature, and that alone ought to tell you something. When she kissed her submissive at the end, she was far more convincing as a straight woman than he was as a straight man. Put another way, whoever had the idea to pair a dike with an obvious fairy and call it erotic ought to have their heads examined. I had to ask my old lady three or four separate times if anyone saw her take this piece of tripe from the library sale rack and am embarrassed we watched the whole thing.

Yet, underneath, he was actually one of the most respectable and wise gentlemen of his age. David Finch's The Elephant Man is a somewhat fictionalized film that overemphasizes the suffering that Merrick went through during his career as a sideshow attraction, but still maintains the point that you should not judge a book by its cover, or in this case, judge a person by his appearance.John Hurt was perfectly cast as Joseph Merrick. It's hard to see any real expressions in his face, because enormous quantities of makeup was put upon him every day of shooting. And it was true in real life that Merrick could barely even talk, or make facial expressions. All of the acting comes from John Hurt's voice. But he does it magnificently to make the film version of Merrick a lovable character. Anthony Hopkins was appropriately cast as the quiet, intelligent, and respectable doctor Sir Frederick Treves, who found Merrick and offered his services. There were a few other characters who were made to be antagonists for the film and did not, as far as history can tell, existed or at least, interacted with Joseph Merrick. But they were necessary additions to keep the story rolling.The film is entirely shot black-and-white, despite being shot at the dawn of the 1980s, but it almost seems appropriate. I myself cannot put my finger on why it works out so well. Maybe to make it all seem ancient? To make it look like all the black-and-white photographs of Merrick, who died long before color film ever came out? Maybe it was just a creative idea by the director or cinematographer. Whatever the case, it makes the film seem even more flawless and dramatic. The opening sequence did not make a whole lot of sense to me at first and I still don't quite grasp what Finch was trying to show, but once it get pasts that, then the whole film is understandable and magnificent. The final sequence of the film is one of the most dramatic one-character scenes in any movie I've ever seen.It is a shame that Joseph Merrick had to die so young, but maybe then again, it was his own choice to die at his age.

Purists may have issues with Jackson's theatrical license, but as someone who has read Tolkien's books several times and seen the films 4-5 times each, I never felt that Jackson went too far or compromised Tolkien's story, the mythology he developed or the wonderful characters he brought to life. Many have said what Jackson did could not be done. He has not only proved the nay-sayers wrong, but lovingly crafted a set of films which will, for many decades to come, stand out as a great achievement. This is the first of three reviews I am publishing on IMDb for these films. I am labeling them Parts 1, 2, and 3 just in case anybody wants to read them in order. The reviews will be self-contained, but will also be enhanced by a chronological reading. My reviews will focus on the extended edition DVDs, though my comments are also relevant to the theatrical releases.The Fellowship of the Ring introduces the key characters and the broad story arc of the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Wizard Gandalf the Grey travels to a small town for small people (Hobbits)to help celebrate Bilbo Baggins' birthday. The very elderly Baggins doesn't look a day over 45, and soon it becomes apparent why. Since the great adventure of his life, a quest he was sent on by Gandalf himself, he has possessed the most powerful object in all of Middle Earth &#150; The One Ring. This ring is evil incarnate, with an insatiable lust for power, it taints every creature who possesses it and tries to work its way back to its creator &#150; Dark Lord Sauron. Bilbo uses the ring to disappear, as he intends to spend his senescence with his friends the Elves in Rivendell. But activating the ring, he draws the attention of Lord Sauron from thousands of miles away in the land of Mordor. Realizing what has occurred, Gandalf scrambles to determine a course of action and recruits Bilbo's nephew Frodo and his loyal gardener Samwise to bear the ring to the Council of Elrond in Rivendell. Thusly, the seeds of the fellowship are planted in the soil of the Shire.At this point, we are about 1\/6th of the way through The Fellowship. Fairly soon thereafter, it becomes clear who will compose the fellowship, and who and what these people are. Though the succeeding films are not entitled Fellowship, they follow the adventures of the surviving central characters. Characterization is done just as Tolkien did it in the original novel &#150; by example not discourse. For example, we are given hints to the identity of Strider (Mortenson) earlier on in the movie than in the novel, but the actual significance of this remains ambiguous until about midway through. Strong characterization is key to the success of the entire trilogy. To summarize, Peter Jackson, his team and cast &#150; NAIL the characterization. The casting and acting is perfect. It is very difficult to resist the temptation to single out Mortenson and McKellen for carrying their difficult roles so well (Strider\/Aragorn and Gandalf), but why risk diminishing the contributions of the rest of the cast? Nobody mis-steps, and it is clear from the beginning that the entire cast was thoroughly and completed engaged with the task before them.Tolkien believed that no film would ever do his work justice, and until this trilogy, he was correct.Peter Jackson and his team have managed to do exactly what they set out to. As Jackson himself has said in reference to the film trilogy, they set out to 'make Tolkien's film.' Jackson successfully drew out elements of all three books, expanding and contracting, rearranging, and sometimes adding whole subplots which are hinted at in the books, but not well explained, in order to adopt the grand story to the film medium. Arwen (Liv Tyler), daughter of Elrond and Elven lover of Aragorn, for example, is introduced early in the films and plays a role in the films which is much more equal to her significance than it was in the books.The Howard Shore score is lovely, and its simple themes are used to great effect throughout all three movies. The musical collaborations improvising on Shore's basic themes are great, and, though they feature some prominent performers &#150; are never weighed down by star-power.Jackson made all three movies simultaneously. This technique allowed for perfect continuity, and permitted much greater flexibility in editing and post-production work than would normally be allowed. Knowing that he would need to establish and support his own fellowship to make this production work, he also knew that success would make the production legendary. So, he documented the creation of the films beautifully. Two complete DVDs full of documentary pieces are included in all three Special Edition Packages in the trilogy. Many are likely to be bored by the details in these documentaries, but those interested in the creative process behind the films will be provided with a more comprehensive view than I can remember ever seeing in any similar DVD package. The Fellowship of the Rings is as true a representation of Tolkien's novel as can be imagined. Although some aspects of the stories in the novel were adapted to the screen, the essentials, the characters, and the overall story are not just recognizable, but ENHANCED by the film. What results is a film that is not just entertaining, but an enormous fulfillment of an undying wish of millions of fans around the world.Very highly recommended.

Only the Four Classic Greek Elements (Earth, Fire, Water, and Wind) plus a fifth element - the supreme being - can ward off this evil presence.And so begins The Fifth Element, French filmmaker Luc Besson's (La Femme Nikita, The Professional) lavish nod to the sci-fi genre. I contend that not a whole lot of science fiction is high on intelligence, but Besson's film is not only high on intelligence, but imagination. With plenty of beautiful special effects, sights, sounds, story, perfectly chosen actors and Eric Serra's fitting score, The Fifth Element is pure sci-fi fun at the movies, the likes of which haven't been seen in a long time.The Fifth Element is simply an extravagant tale of good vs. evil in the realm of the science fiction genre. Besson began work on the screenplay while in high school, and the self-contained universe he creates is brought to life here flawlessly. Most filmmakers when trying to bring an outrageous fantasy to life on the screen tend to get lost in the fantasy, short-changing actors and story for special effects. For the most part, the actors chosen - Bruce Willis, Gary Oldman, Ian Holm, and others - are alive & kicking, and not cardboard cut-outs. I'm not saying that they're contenders for the Oscars, but you get my assertion that they are far better (and smarter) than most of the characters you typically find in most science fiction adventure fantasies, and are not stock or background to special effects and pulse-pounding action sequences.As I stated earlier, in New York City 300 years into the future (the 23rd century, I believe), evil - a great, big fireball named (named!) Mr. Shadow - is on its way to wipe out all life in the universe. So it's up to his Earthbound lackey Zorg (Oldman, over-the-top, as usual) and his alien-warrior minions to track down and obtain four stones representing the elements (Earth, Fire, Water, and Wind). But before that happens, we learn that cab driver Korben Dallas (Willis) has obtained the fare of a lifetime - the perfectly beautiful and perfectly dangerous redhead Leeloo (Milla Jovovich) - who literally crash-lands in the back of his cab after she was first regenerated from a scratch of alien DNA in a laboratory. It's love at first sight, but their relationship troubles are hampered by the fact that she's wanted by the police after escaping from said lab and the fact that she speaks an unknown extraterrestrial language.After eluding the cops, Dallas, a former soldier-of-fortune, takes Leeloo to Priest Cornelius (Holm), who realizes exactly who (and what) Leeloo is and what her role in saving the world is - she's the supreme being, the fifth element. So now Korben, under the guise of winning a contest to the outer-world Phloston Paradise, along with Cornelius and Leeloo, sets out to - what else is there to do? - save the world, with Zorg and his minions in hot pursuit.The Fifth Element, considering its production and the outrageousness of the story, should not be as good as it is. This is a beautiful-looking picture, eschewing the usual post-apocalyptic gloominess that's associated with futuristic science fiction movies for a marvelously shiny (and remarkably clean!) future-world New York. But Besson is a great storyteller, and knows what he wants on his picture. His script (co-authored with Robert Mark Kamen) is intelligently and expertly written, with strong, believable characters and perfectly composed dialogue that doesn't lose itself in meaningless diatribe and ludicrous explanations of trying to figure out what's going on. And it also contains enough action, humor (provided mostly in the second half by comedian Chris Tucker as flamboyant radio personality Ruby Rhod), intelligence, a performance by a blue-skinned alien opera singer named Diva Plavalaguna, and romance (yes, romance, and you thought it was just another brainless sci-fi picture) to ensure that it remains accessible even to those who don't care much for this science fiction\/fantasy stuff.The film flies through its plot, arriving at a climax that is action-packed and shows off the same European action-chic that made Besson a household name with his earlier Nikita and Professional. In these action sequences on-board the Phloston Paradise cruise ship, there are explosions, gunfights with alien beasts, martial arts, and a special effects finale that has to be seen to be believed, but at the same time may be a little bit of a disappointment for those expecting a bigger payoff. And while the humor can draw in those uninterested in this sci-fi\/fantasy stuff, it can at times be a little silly and inappropriate and take away from the adventure.The Fifth Element is certainly one of the best and most imaginative pieces of original science fiction fanfare produced in a long time. That a sharp director such as Luc Besson was able to get behind the camera of his own little world and not lose himself in it shows that he's a capable filmmaker who's perfectly in control of his film-making elements.9\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"30 November 2007","score":"6 out of 11 people found the following review useful","review":" In The Fifth Element, we learn that every 5000 years evil returns from the deepest reaches of outer space to try to wipe out all life in the universe.

So now Korben, under the guise of winning a contest to the outer-world Phloston Paradise, along with Cornelius and Leeloo, sets out to - what else is there to do? - save the world, with Zorg and his minions in hot pursuit.The Fifth Element, considering its production and the outrageousness of the story, should not be as good as it is. This is a beautiful-looking picture, eschewing the usual post-apocalyptic gloominess that's associated with futuristic science fiction movies for a marvelously shiny (and remarkably clean!) future-world New York. But Besson is a great storyteller, and knows what he wants on his picture. His script (co-authored with Robert Mark Kamen) is intelligently and expertly written, with strong, believable characters and perfectly composed dialogue that doesn't lose itself in meaningless diatribe and ludicrous explanations of trying to figure out what's going on. And it also contains enough action, humor (provided mostly in the second half by comedian Chris Tucker as flamboyant radio personality Ruby Rhod), intelligence, a performance by a blue-skinned alien opera singer named Diva Plavalaguna, and romance (yes, romance, and you thought it was just another brainless sci-fi picture) to ensure that it remains accessible even to those who don't care much for this science fiction\/fantasy stuff.The film flies through its plot, arriving at a climax that is action-packed and shows off the same European action-chic that made Besson a household name with his earlier Nikita and Professional. In these action sequences on-board the Phloston Paradise cruise ship, there are explosions, gunfights with alien beasts, martial arts, and a special effects finale that has to be seen to be believed, but at the same time may be a little bit of a disappointment for those expecting a bigger payoff. And while the humor can draw in those uninterested in this sci-fi\/fantasy stuff, it can at times be a little silly and inappropriate and take away from the adventure.The Fifth Element is certainly one of the best and most imaginative pieces of original science fiction fanfare produced in a long time. That a sharp director such as Luc Besson was able to get behind the camera of his own little world and not lose himself in it shows that he's a capable filmmaker who's perfectly in control of his film-making elements.9\/10 ","genre":"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"30 November 2007","score":"6 out of 11 people found the following review useful","review":" In The Fifth Element, we learn that every 5000 years evil returns from the deepest reaches of outer space to try to wipe out all life in the universe. Only the Four Classic Greek Elements (Earth, Fire, Water, and Wind) plus a fifth element - the supreme being - can ward off this evil presence.And so begins The Fifth Element, French filmmaker Luc Besson's (La Femme Nikita, The Professional) lavish nod to the sci-fi genre. I contend that not a whole lot of science fiction is high on intelligence, but Besson's film is not only high on intelligence, but imagination. With plenty of beautiful special effects, sights, sounds, story, perfectly chosen actors and Eric Serra's fitting score, The Fifth Element is pure sci-fi fun at the movies, the likes of which haven't been seen in a long time.The Fifth Element is simply an extravagant tale of good vs. evil in the realm of the science fiction genre. Besson began work on the screenplay while in high school, and the self-contained universe he creates is brought to life here flawlessly. Most filmmakers when trying to bring an outrageous fantasy to life on the screen tend to get lost in the fantasy, short-changing actors and story for special effects. For the most part, the actors chosen - Bruce Willis, Gary Oldman, Ian Holm, and others - are alive & kicking, and not cardboard cut-outs. I'm not saying that they're contenders for the Oscars, but you get my assertion that they are far better (and smarter) than most of the characters you typically find in most science fiction adventure fantasies, and are not stock or background to special effects and pulse-pounding action sequences.As I stated earlier, in New York City 300 years into the future (the 23rd century, I believe), evil - a great, big fireball named (named!) Mr. Shadow - is on its way to wipe out all life in the universe. So it's up to his Earthbound lackey Zorg (Oldman, over-the-top, as usual) and his alien-warrior minions to track down and obtain four stones representing the elements (Earth, Fire, Water, and Wind). But before that happens, we learn that cab driver Korben Dallas (Willis) has obtained the fare of a lifetime - the perfectly beautiful and perfectly dangerous redhead Leeloo (Milla Jovovich) - who literally crash-lands in the back of his cab after she was first regenerated from a scratch of alien DNA in a laboratory.

The story that was written was entertaining and was fairly good. However, key elements to the story are missing.1)The introduction is just an illusion. Seriously there isn't more than 30 seconds of intro before they get right to the story itself. They missed a huge opportunity here and they pay for it later. Later in the second battle scene I couldn't tell if the guys dieing were peasants or warriors because nothing is known about anyone but Ibn. I found myself asking a dozen questions, such as why would a kingdom on the Black sea help their Norwegian counterparts.2)In the middle(which was very well done) the only problem I had was the prince in the town they go to. Because of a short introduction you don't know anything about this kingdom other than it is plagued by Wendols. The prince just kind of disappears after his crony is killed and left another question is left unanswered.

The idea of this monster coming back to haunt the actors is ingenious!

Any fan of movies in general should see this picture, whether they've seen another one in the series or not. I have a problem, though, with some of the special effects. Watching it on the television, the scene where Heather chases her son across the freeway looks staged and fake...you can imagine Heather standing in front of a blue screen and pretending to dodge cars...the lighting is all wrong. And, some of the action scenes (like the first scene where the special effects hand attacks the techies)are rushed and hard to follow. Still, the cameos by Bob Shay and others are fun to watch. One of my favorite movies of all time, just for the plot (and Heather's close-ups).

His new friends? Pat Garrett and Arkansas Dave, played by William Peterson and Christian Slater, respectively. Also joining Billy's side is a young boy by the name of Tom O'Folliard (Balthazar Getty). However, there is news to Billy his testimony is wanted against Murphy's old goons from the first film. He accepts, in exchange for a full pardon of his crimes.What he discovers is that it was a setup by the Irish politicians of Lincoln. Breaking free, Billy releases the remaining Regulators from the last film. Doc (Kiefer Sutherland) and Chavez (Lou Diamond Phillips) return to Billy's side after a breakout of Lincoln.Preparing to go for Mexico, Billy's group is swelled by Henry William French (Alan Ruck), and it is then that Pat Garrett heads off his own way. The group heads out, and Garrett is hired to shoot Billy the Kid dead. What follows is a blaze across the West, a race between two groups, and internal conflict between the individual characters in Billy's group.The film is truly a good sequel one might think it is not as good as the original, but there is something new about this film. With the additions of such good characters as James Cobourn, Alan Ruck, and Christian Slater, coupled with the talents of the old cast, the film is vitalized to a level excelling the original. The music is definitely superior to the first film, and Jon Bon Jovi truly made a classic song for this film (Blaze of Glory). The characters are as colourful as in the first one, and the acting is great. Plus, the storyline of the sequel opens up new fields to explore, and expand on those left behind by the first film.Say what you want about the film, I believe that it is certainly equal to the original Young Guns, and maybe even pulls ahead in certain area. Certainly the music is much better, and the action is just as fiery and electric, and the actors are young and very talented.Truly a classic film.

The best, in my opinion, were Jake Gyllenhaal, and Jena Malone, who played Gretchen. Their chemistry was brilliant. the sibling rivalry between Donnie and Elizabeth Darko was incredible, Jake and Maggie Gyllenhaal were phenomenal. The actors seem like they were created for that part.The story line presented is at first a little confusing.
