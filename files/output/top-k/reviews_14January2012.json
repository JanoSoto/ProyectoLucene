[{"date":"14 January 2012","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Election is based in the school Carver High (named after George Washingtion Carver, a famous Negro rights activist at the turn of the century) and is about the lead up to the school election. It focuses on the lives of Paul and Trish Metzler, Tracy Frick (Reese Witherspoon), and their teacher Mr McCallum (Matthew Broderick). I will first analyse each of the characters, and then comment on the film as a whole.McCallum is the teacher that handles the student government body and the elections. At this time Frick is the only candidate but he does not like her. The reasons I will discuss later, but simply put, he simply found that there was a really nasty side to this apparently studious girl. As such he tries to rig the election to destroy Frick and promote the school jock Paul Metzler. Though one may think that McCallum has noble reasons for doing this, it could simply come down to the tall poppy syndrome. But then that is not really in line with his character, because McCallum is not the type of person that gets jealous. He loves his job and does not want anything more.This does not mean that he is not a content individual. He says at the beginning that he loves his wife, but it becomes quickly apparent that he does not. We actually see that there is a distance between them, and this is shown even more when he goes down into the basement to watch his porno movies. He is not an adulterer, but rather a man who has entered into a relationship that has turned stale. It is not clear if his wife feels the same way, but she really does not seem to be that concerned about what happens to him, and takes the first opportunity that arises to get rid of him. Tracy Frick is ambitious. She is the one that has taken opportunities to rise in fame and status in the school. This status has its draw backs though and that is that she has no friends. She is not hated she is just the ambitious one who has no time for friends. There are the few students that detest her, but generally she simply is too caught up in her work to step back and enjoy life.The reason the McCallum hates her is because one of her teachers, Dave, who happened to be McCallum's best friend, was destroyed by her. It began as a simple friendship and quickly blossomed into an adulterous relationship. When it began to get to hot for her, she used the fact that she was a student under Dave's care to completely destroy his career. It is this cruel and malicious side, a side that will do anything to get to the top, that he is fighting against by pitting her against Metzler, the school jock.In the end we are given the impression that Frick really never gained anything. She is seen with a politician, and it appears that she has actually climbed far, but the question is what did she lose out on and is she pained by it. The question is no for in college she realised that those who want to rise to the top rise to the top alone. It is that moment of epiphany that she realised that she wanted power and for that she had to forgo friends. Even though we only see a glimpse of her college life, we can see that she simply becomes the bitch and thus alienates herself more from her peers.Paul Metzler is the guy against Frick. He is opposite to Frick in almost every way. He is popular, wealthy, stupid, and most of all humble. As we are allowed into the minds of the characters, we see how Metzler thinks and we see a man who cares not only for others but for his sister as well. He finds this whole presidential race a little game, and isn't really concerned if he looses. Metzler finds that friends are far more important than power, and would rather give up chasing power and simply enjoy the company of his friends.Finally there is Trish. She is far more dangerous than Frick. Where Frick is callous, Trish is able to use her cynicism to work into what people hate and use that to raise their spirits. During the speeches, Frick gives a typical politician's speech, Paul a very poor recital of a speech written for him, and Trish then turns around, in a fit of emotional passion, uses the dislike of the whole election process to bring all the students to her side. In the end if she had been allowed to run, she would have destroyed the entire student government committee. As such, the teachers planned to destroy her chances and influence and ended up removing her from the school.This is a fairly good movie. It allows us to enter into the heads of the main characters. There are numerous important minor characters, but the characters that I have explored here we see into their minds and understand what they are thinking. As such these are the characters that we should focus on when trying to understand the movie. What it seems to show us is society in a microcosm, and the whole election process in a microcosm. There are the puppets (Paul), the ambitious ones (Tracy), and the destroyers (Trish), and then there is the power behind the throne (McCallum).
