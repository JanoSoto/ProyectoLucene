PHIBES is a superb stylish movie that definitely ranks amongst the best of Vincent Price's work. May he rest in peace for delivering such an emotionally moving piece of entertainment.The most effective and indeed creative idea at work here is the presentation of the movie. Its theme is difficult to decipher in precise terms. Some will see it as a horror movie. Some will see it as a dark comedy. Some will see it as a typical revenge epic. And others will recognise a tragic love story.The plot of the movie can be summed up without giving away spoilers - Dr. Phibes was involved in a car accident during which he lost his ability to speak. His wife dies following an unsuccessful surgical operation. Dr. Phibes then decides to take revenge on the doctors whom he considers responsible for her death. A series of murders based off the biblical plagues takes place leaving local police baffled.Whilst the plot on paper sounds very disturbing, the execution is done in a very light-hearted, almost comical, tone. This is supported by a very uplifting musical score. Most of the gore effects are left to the imagination rather than being presented on the screen. Violence is very subtle and hardly any overt violence is shown. As such, the movie gained a mere PG rating from the MPAA. The virtual absence of gore works heavily in the movie's favour by enabling it to retain a light tone that ensures the movie never becomes unwatchable.Some creativity is used during the execution of the murder scenes, providing obvious inspiration for the producers of THEATRE OF BLOOD, another Vincent Price movie with a similar theme. In addition, THE ABOMINABLE DR. PHIBES plays a part in setting standards for the slasher movies of the 1980s as far as creativity goes. It has to be said however, that the movies of that decade, many of which are highly entertaining, are not nearly as stylish or classy as this movie.A very carefully crafted screenplay ensures the movie plays with the mind of its audience. Many will be confused as to whether they should sympathise with Dr. Phibes or his victims. Whilst Dr. Phibes commits gruesome murders without repentance, he shows a very loving side as he plays his organ whilst constantly thinking about his deceased wife. Vincent Price delivers a superb performance that really touches upon the emotions of the viewers during these scenes.Also worthy of mention is Joseph Cotten, who steps in for Peter Cushing (who turned down the role), as Dr. Vesalius, the lead doctor performing the surgical operation on Phibes's late wife. Joseph Cotten is given some very emotional scenes to work with, which he places to perfection and mirrors those where Dr. Phibes reminisces over his deceased wife.The actors playing the victims also deliver superb performances. The movie particularly makes effective use of Terry-Thomas, a comic actor well known to British audiences at the time.Special kudos should be given to the excellent Peter Jeffrey, who adds plenty of comical moments to the movie as the police inspector assigned to investigate the murders. He is given superb support by John Cater, a very unknown actor, who steals every scene he's in with perfect glee as the police superintendent constantly on the backs of the officers below him. Both of these actors reprise their roles in the sequel, DR. PHIBES RISES AGAIN.Let's not forget Virginia North, who plays Phibes's assistant, Vulnavia. Vulnavia is shown to be a mute, who never speaks. But due to a superb performance by the actress, we can read her thoughts through her facial expressions. This is a very difficult role to pull off, but she does it to perfection.Ultimately, THE ABOMINABLE DR. PHIBES is successful due to an excellent combination of suspense, dark humour, superb acting performances from all concerned, very emotionally touching scenes, creativity, intelligent witty scripting and stylish execution of the whole product.I can definitely recommend this for fans of Vincent Price.

I won't be original to mention at least two long scenes in the film that are absolutely brilliant and can be enjoyed on their own over and over again. Besides, these scenes don't have triple narration, just the music that makes them even more impressive. Speaking of the languages presentation, the DVD leaves a lot to be desired. The film is presented with English subtitles, spoken English and Spanish, and Russian voice over which is very annoying. Even though Russian is my native tongue, I looked for the option to turn off the narration but unsuccessfully. With all these voices and subtitles that won't go, you are distracted from the visual beauty of the film which is its best value. I suggest, you go on YouTube, find the rooftop scene and the funeral procession, and watch them in awe, be amazed and fascinated. That's basically all I have to say about Soy Cuba, the propaganda film that was made in 1964 during the victorious days of Fidel Castro Revolution and high hopes for new happy life for the hard working citizens of the Caribbean Paradise Island. Ironically, the film I Am Cuba, as anti-American propaganda as they ever come, made as a Cuban-Soviet co-production, was not widely released in either pro-Communist country and was almost forgotten until it was restored and presented in the USA in the middle of the 90s by two celebrated American Film Directors, Martin Scorsese and Francis Coppola.Of course, I am impressed by its brilliant cinematography, and who would not? I am not going to describe the beautiful insanity of Sergey Urusevskij's camera in the opening scene of the film or its free soar in the funeral procession later into the picture. It's been done hundreds of times already. If you need an explanation on how these impossible camera movements were achieved, go to Soy Cuba Wikipedia page - they have a thorough and detailed description of the shooting process and how it was done. But let me tell you something. If you really want to see a great Soviet film made by the same Director-Cinematographer team, the wonderful, engaging, fascinating, ahead of its time yet truthfully depicting the tragic events of the history FILM, with the shots that are included in the text books, with the poignant touching story, with the real characters that you never forget, watch Mikhail Kalatozov's B\/W film Cranes are flying which he and his genius cinematographer Sergei Urusevskij made in 1957. Cranes Are Flying has never become outdated and never will. It will stay unforgettable and compelling as well as cinematographically perfect as long as the Art of Cinema lives. Cranes are Flying is timeless. Soy Cuba is a product of certain time period and its politics. It is not even the problem that the film is a shameless propaganda. The propaganda can be powerful and artistic. Watch for example ten minutes long animated film of Jan Svankmajer The End of Stalinism in Bohemia. One of the reviewers on this site is asking How did they dare to make such a film in 1963? I guess the answer is that by 1963 the short period in the history of the USSR which is known as thaw or ottepel' that began after Stalin's death in 1953, was over. The 60s represented the return to the Stalinism aesthetics even if officially it had never been admitted. It would take another quarter of the century until the truth about some events and politics was finally told during the perestroika in the late 1980s and after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. IMO, Soy Cuba is overall a weak film with very creative virtuoso cinematography. I suppose that the Film Students will learn a lot from its technical values but it is a film with the parts much better than the whole thing.

If you need an explanation on how these impossible camera movements were achieved, go to Soy Cuba Wikipedia page - they have a thorough and detailed description of the shooting process and how it was done. But let me tell you something. If you really want to see a great Soviet film made by the same Director-Cinematographer team, the wonderful, engaging, fascinating, ahead of its time yet truthfully depicting the tragic events of the history FILM, with the shots that are included in the text books, with the poignant touching story, with the real characters that you never forget, watch Mikhail Kalatozov's B\/W film Cranes are flying which he and his genius cinematographer Sergei Urusevskij made in 1957. Cranes Are Flying has never become outdated and never will. It will stay unforgettable and compelling as well as cinematographically perfect as long as the Art of Cinema lives. Cranes are Flying is timeless. Soy Cuba is a product of certain time period and its politics. It is not even the problem that the film is a shameless propaganda. The propaganda can be powerful and artistic. Watch for example ten minutes long animated film of Jan Svankmajer The End of Stalinism in Bohemia. One of the reviewers on this site is asking How did they dare to make such a film in 1963? I guess the answer is that by 1963 the short period in the history of the USSR which is known as thaw or ottepel' that began after Stalin's death in 1953, was over. The 60s represented the return to the Stalinism aesthetics even if officially it had never been admitted. It would take another quarter of the century until the truth about some events and politics was finally told during the perestroika in the late 1980s and after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. IMO, Soy Cuba is overall a weak film with very creative virtuoso cinematography. I suppose that the Film Students will learn a lot from its technical values but it is a film with the parts much better than the whole thing.

I won't be original to mention at least two long scenes in the film that are absolutely brilliant and can be enjoyed on their own over and over again. Besides, these scenes don't have triple narration, just the music that makes them even more impressive. Speaking of the languages presentation, the DVD leaves a lot to be desired. The film is presented with English subtitles, spoken English and Spanish, and Russian voice over which is very annoying. Even though Russian is my native tongue, I looked for the option to turn off the narration but unsuccessfully. With all these voices and subtitles that won't go, you are distracted from the visual beauty of the film which is its best value. I suggest, you go on YouTube, find the rooftop scene and the funeral procession, and watch them in awe, be amazed and fascinated. That's basically all I have to say about Soy Cuba, the propaganda film that was made in 1964 during the victorious days of Fidel Castro Revolution and high hopes for new happy life for the hard working citizens of the Caribbean Paradise Island. Ironically, the film I Am Cuba, as anti-American propaganda as they ever come, made as a Cuban-Soviet co-production, was not widely released in either pro-Communist country and was almost forgotten until it was restored and presented in the USA in the middle of the 90s by two celebrated American Film Directors, Martin Scorsese and Francis Coppola.Of course, I am impressed by its brilliant cinematography, and who would not?

Maybe 'clunker' is too strong a word, but this is definitely one of Hitchcock's lesser films. It is ponderous, with phony suspense, ill-placed humor, and Doris Day singing 'Que Sera, Sera'... twice. There are, to be sure, some typical Hitchcock touches, but not enough to sustain this overblown two-hour melodrama. Which is really what it feels like, more than the thriller or international intrigue it was meant to be. James Stewart is fine in the lead; his performance is better than the material. It would be easy to say Doris Day is overwrought in her portrayal, but again, it is really the script that fails her. I don't know that any other actress could have done better. The film veers from feverishly serious to clumsily comedic, often in the same scene. A problem here is the subject matter. All parents' worst nightmare is the thought of their young child being kidnapped and placed in danger, and that is exactly what happens. Stewart and Day go from being greatly worried one moment to making silly banter the next, and it just doesn't work. Day in fact often has a confused look on her face as though she doesn't know HOW she's supposed to react. The climactic scene in the Royal Albert Hall is beautiful to look at, and provides the added treat of having famed film composer Bernard Herrman actually conduct the orchestra, but as a suspense setpiece, it is completely ineffective. The scenes following it not only feel superfluous, but during the second rousing rendition of 'Que Sera, Sera,' are also almost unbearably interminable. The standing-around and emotional handwringing in this movie really grow quite tedious. (When the boy starts whistling from upstairs, you'd think nothing could stop Stewart from running up to free him, but no, he just stands there impatiently, decorum apparently demanding he wait till the end of the song.) 'The Man Who Knew Too Much' just goes to prove that even a Master sometimes comes up short.

As dated as a lot of flicks from that era were, many of them have the all-important re-watchability factor. While many are fun to re-watch just to make fun of them, there are a lot that I think still hold up because of elements that will always be important to films plot, dialogue, and character. THE HIDDEN is one of them on such film. A modern B sci-fi action flick, it is hardly forgettable and actually has a lot of truth in it. THE HIDDEN is in the vein of 50s sci-fi like THE THING or INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS that have now attained cult status. THE HIDDEN is the 80s version of those films and I think it's one of the best of its kind ever. THE HIDDEN starts off with a bang, literally, as a fast-driving criminal Jack DeVries (played by Chris Mulkey, who solidly sets the tone for the rest of the film) crashes into a bank, robbing it, then ends up in a police standoff. He is killed and the cops find out that he had no prior criminal record and was a mild-mannered insurance salesman before he went nuts. The next lunatic is a businessman Jonathan Miller (wonderfully done by William Boyett) who acts just like DeVries did driving fast, playing loud music and committing criminal acts for no apparent reason.Enter FBI agent Lloyd Gallagher (Kyle MacLachlan in a brilliantly realized portrayal) who is on the trail of DeVries and Miller, telling the cops that they were accomplices. The lead cop investigating this strange series of events is Tom Beck (stalwart, solid performance by Michael Nouri). Gallagher and Beck team up to track down Miller, who Gallagher says killed his wife, child, and his partner. Turns out that there is really only one killer, an alien that moves from body to body, first DeVries, and after he is killed, then Miller, and Gallagher is an alien, too, looking to stop it. Miller has a heart ailment and the alien can't survive inside an unhealthy human host, so it leaves Miller and enters the body of a stripper Brenda (played by the seductive and sultry Claudia Christian). The scene where Gallagher finally confronts the alien (in the body of Brenda) is exciting, tense, and pulse-pounding. Gallagher kills Brenda, but reveals to Beck that he is an alien and the alien killer is still out there somewhere and must be stopped.Branding Gallagher a lunatic, Beck locks him up. The killer had left Brenda's body and entered the body of a dog belonging to Gallagher's superior Lt. Masterson (played by Clarence Felder). The alien inhabits Masterson and then goes after Gallagher in the jail, a truly memorable, exciting scene. Now Beck believes him and they set out to stop the alien! It's amazing how this movie slipped through the cracks of 1980s action flicks. It's close to as good as some of the best of the 80s (TERMINATOR, ROBOCOP, DIE HARD, LETHAL WEAPON) and has elements of all those films, but does not feel like a ripoff at all. What's really stunning is how believable all the actors (Mulkey, Boyett, Christian, Felder) are at playing the same alien character. They all make you believe it is one alien. In addition to the cast mentioned, Clu Gulager as Lt. Flynn (Gallagher's other superior) and Katherine Gannon as Barbara Beck (Beck's wife) are fine as well. The pacing is perfect, the dialogue solid, effective, and memorable and the action is well-directed and exciting. THE HIDDEN is a classic!

Little do they know that The Beast is actually controlled by an evil wrinkly man known as Darth Empire who is trying to bring stability to the galaxy.This rip off of Spaceballs has plenty of excitement moments- the horse and cart race through the forest at high speed with all the little cute bears running around and cutting down trees, the sword fight in the snow where our heroes fly down a mountain on their shields, and of course the scene where the wizard fights a dragon whilst falling down into a fiery pit to his death. 'YOU AIN'T GETTING PAST ME!' he shouts, smacking his staff into the bridge before he falls to his doom. There are plenty of funny moments, mostly provided by Robbie 'John' Coltrane.

I've given only one thing on IMDb a 10 (a television show, Arrested Development, although there are a few 10s if you count some of its episodes as separate), and this movie is the only thing on IMDb I've given a 1. So you know it has to be bad- so bad it needs to be seen to be believed. It's not Star Wars- it does have freedom fighters rebelling against an alien empire, and the aliens here (Psychlos) are a poor man's wookiee- but it's missing all of the charm. It's set in the year 3000, as is Futurama, and I'd prefer Groening's vision of that year over this one any day.Earth has been taken over by an evil alien race known as the Psychlos from the planet Psychlo, who mine the planet for hundreds of years and make humans an endangered species. However, in 3000 a group of humans believe they can finally stage an effective revolt and exterminate the Psychlos- before the Psychlos exterminate them.Where to begin? A lack of imagination plagues this film, starting with the Psychlos themselves, who again, look like bad wookiees. The name Psychlo itself is just the English word psycho with just one added letter. No attempt was made to construct an alien culture for the Psychlos- they're exactly like humans, with schools and grades, bars and tabs, jobs and salaries, wives and divorce, and so on. The movie hammers the point that the Psychlos are evil. They insult Earth (so we know they're bad), they say they'll exterminate humans, they laugh evilly, and they call our hero a rat brain (a cutting insult)... several times! They refer to humans or man animals as inferior beings, so we're supposed to be proud of ourselves when the humans fight back. The movie Independence Day isn't great but has more luck with that. With Battlefield Earth, we can only feel ashamed that our species made this movie. Reflecting the lack of imagination, the same swipe from the centre is used for every scene change. Seriously.The storytelling and direction is problematic, but so is the writing and acting. Travolta's joke about growing a third arm makes for bad sarcasm and the constant use of the word leverage is meant to be a cool motif, but that's so transparent that it's just lame. The acting is bad, including- maybe even especially- Travolta's. He consistently sounds fake, whether he's acting pleasant towards his alien superiors, acting like he doesn't like his job, or expressing anger towards that black alien. On top of all that, the explosion of the planet Psychlo is a poor effect. So was the Death Star's destruction in Star Wars, but Battlefield Earth came out over 20 years later.How does a movie like Battlefield Earth get made? How are projects like these not nipped in the bud? The story happened to be the brainchild of the founder of Scientology, the notorious L. Ron Hubbard, and Travolta, a Scientologist, really wanted this movie to happen. He spent much of his own money on this. This wouldn't be the first time where religion clouds one's judgment.

The characters are perfectly cast by known, yet lesser used actors. This isn't a Tom Cruise, Ben Afleck, Julia Roberts type film and that's one of the reasons for it's long lasting appeal. It's hard to imagine anyone other than André the Giant as the lovable Fessik. Arguably the most recognizable actor in the movie is Billy Crystal in a short but hilarious scene.

I have to say that my favorite character was Kirby. The fact that he could couldn't get the love of his life was depressing ( Ohh, and Judd Nelson's character bugged the crap out of me.

It must have influenced him so that I can't believe it was a coincidence that when he created the story of Tevye the Milkman he had five daughters and he was just looking to get them off his hands just like Mr. Bennett was with his five.Of course the difference between Czarist Russia for Jews and being part of the landed gentry in early Victorian England is cultural light years. Still fathers, mothers, daughters and prospective sons-in-law are the same wherever you go.Filling some very big shoes in the lead was Topol who to this day is still appearing in stage productions of Fiddler On The Roof. But in 1971 people still remembered Zero Mostel on Broadway. Mostel was no longer in it, but Fiddler On The Roof was coming to the end of its then record run of 3242 performances. Topol had done the London production though so he was no novice in the part. Topol justified Norman Jewison's faith in him by garnering an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor. Leonard Frey who was Motel the tailor who was the only one from the original Broadway cast and not in the role he did on Broadway got a nomination for Best Supporting Actor. In fact I liked him best in the film, a Yiddish version of Willie Mossop, the worm that turned from another English source, Hobson's Choice.The cultural divide is the thing about Fiddler On The Roof that does separate it from a Victorian novel to a story of a perennially persecuted people. The thing that got me was the people's utter resignation to their fate come what may. Paul Michael Glaser, later Starsky on Starsky&Hutch, is the only one who's mad as hell and not taking it any more. For his pains he winds up in Siberia. Many have wondered why the Jews just marched off to the concentration camps two generations later. The answer in many ways is to be found in the characters Sholem Aleichem created from what he observed during his life. Norman Jewison as a director filled the screen with this stage production. Small wonder among the Oscars that Fiddler On The Roof did win was for cinematography. The film also won for sound and best adapted musical score. The original songs were done by the Broadway team of Jerry Bock and Sheldon Harnick. Bock in writing the music had as keen an ear for the folk music of the culture as Richard Rodgers did in writing an Oriental score for The King And I.If the role of Yente the matchmaker, a name as well as an occupation in Jewish tradition, wasn't in the original play, they'd have to have invented something to get Molly Picon in the film. The movie going public might only know her from such mainstream films like Come Blow Your Horn, but this woman who started as a child entertaining newly arrived folks from places like Anatevka became the First Lady of the Yiddish Theater. It wouldn't have been right to do Sholem Aleichem on the big screen without her in the film in some way.Fiddler On The Roof is one of the best adapted Broadway musicals to the big screen ever done. And this review is dedicated to my late grandfather Isidore Kogan who came from Kamenets-Podolsk, a place just like Anatevka and settled here along with eight brothers and sisters in a watch repair business. I never knew Isidore, he died a week before I made my earthly debut, but he would have so loved Fiddler On The Roof.
