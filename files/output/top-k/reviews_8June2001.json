It's unique style of directing and cinematography is second to none.  I cannot put into words how stylish this movie really plays out on the screen.Moulin Rouge tells the story of a young writer who moves to Paris with plans of writing his best piece of work and finding love.  Upon arriving, he sits to write and realizes that he has the worst case of writer's block ever.  This started a chain reaction of very unusual events that would change his life. He is thrust into using his poetic talent to write a play entitled `Spectacular, Spectacular!'Ewan McGregor is indeed spectacular as Christian, the love-hunting writer.  He is great in this role, and who would have guessed that he could sing; not well, but he tried.  I have seen McGregor perform miracles in everything from &#145;Shallow Grave' to &#145;Star Wars Episode I' to perhaps his now second greatest performance in &#145;Trainspotting', but his performance in Moulin Rouge is nothing less than wonderful.Nicole Kidman plays the seductive `Sparkling Diamond', Satine, a woman paid to make men believe she loves them.  She mistakenly believes Christian to be a Duke she wants to seduce so he will finance her budding acting career, only to end up falling in love with the penniless writer.  Kidman's performance is very good, and she sings rather well.  Watching Kidman play, and I mean play in every sense of the word, in this movie was a delight.  Her ability to make the audience laugh was a skill I didn't know she possessed.  Finally, John Leguizamo has not been this funny since &#145;The Pest.'  He is certainly a forgotten funnyman in Hollywood (To Wong Foo comes to mind).  His character in Moulin Rouge, Toulouse, is absolutely indescribable! While many might think Moulin Rouge is a musical, let it be known that it is not merely a musical, but one could say it creates a whole new genre.  I have been known to despise musicals, especially Disney Masterpieces, but Moulin Rouge is different.  Moulin Rouge is a nice refreshing change to the all too familiar explosions, jokes, and love stories that are virtually force-fed to us in films lately.  Not that I mind movies like `Armageddon', `Star Wars', and `The Rock', but getting ready for a summer full of action blockbusters such as `Tomb Raider', `Planet of the Apes', and the much anticipated `Jurassic Park 3'will be much easier thanks to the blissful Moulin Rouge.

A line like that is just incredibly funny, but I would have to say, that this movie, definitely could not have survived without Chris Tucker. Tucker's Smokey character was what made the movie just interesting to watch because you wanted to see what happened to Smokey and the drug dealer who's chasing him. Watching Smokey smoke as much marijuana as he could and seeing what it did to him was very funny and seeing Craig and him...well...Craig learn from the mistake they made of playing with drug money, actually gave the movie some meaning, not to mention Craig standing up to the woman beating character of Deebo at the end. In short, Friday is not just a movie of two guys sitting on a porch in the hood smoking drugs, drinking forties, and trying to get laid, they actually do learn from their mistakes, well, at least one would hope.

He has been hired to  steal $6 billion in unused government funds.  The problem lie in the fact that the funds are locked in a tangled cyber web that would make Bill Gates blush. Shear decides to seek the help of supercomputer hacker Stanley Jobson (Hugh Jackman). Stanley is also a man with a problem in that he is a felon, living in voided trailer-park , with no rights to his daughter Holly (Camryn Grimes). To further exert his power, Shear sends his femme fatale sidekick Ginger (Halle Berry) to seal the deal with Stanley. The deal was simple crack the codes for us and we will get your daughter back and make you very rich.This movie tackles two issues in film making1) what is the real definition of a happy ending and 2) can we really believe what we see and hear in any situation?.Sure we love to see the hero save the day and defend the common good; but in real life, that's not always the case. We love to root for the hero, see the problem through his eyes, and bank on his point of view. But what about the villain? When was the last time an audience left a theatre cheering the villain and deeming his actions as a `happy ending'. This is what Shear is pushing over and over in this movie. If the villain gets away, isn't that a happy ending for him him?Shear also talks a lot about redirection using the famous magicians of the past. By directing the eye and ear at one thing, you totally miss what is really happening. This is directly related to film making in that  a lot of films will turn on the explosions, cool stunts, and CGI's to cover the fact that the script is lacking or the actors are weak (for proof of this see the following movies Batman and Robin, Battlefield Earth, Anaconda, The Rock, Broken Arrow). Unfortunately, Shear uses this theory to get away with billion dollar crimes.While watching this film, I got the feeling that the writer was really infatuated with the Shear character because even though the trailers push Stanley as the lead, it is Shear that takes the limelight. The end result is a movie with a great secondary lead (villain) and the other characters existing around him rather than with him. I will say this Travolta is very good in this. His character is well defined.  But I didn't feel the script did enough to prove this to me that a man like Stanley, whom is trying to turn his life around so he can see his daughter, was trying to make the change. Even though the dialogue said he wasn't, he felt like a practicing criminal the whole time. Halle Berry was nothing more than a sexy pawn (redirection with a great body) with no essence. The acting wasn't bad at all. Director Dominic Sena assembled a great cast. It would have been better had he actually used them equally.As far as the movie as a whole is concerned, It was good as hyped up fluff that practices what it preach.

All human characters are pure caricatures and many are more revolting than the bugs themselves. Jerry O'Connell is likeable however in the leading human role, doing his best to assure us of his honesty. As his great love, Megan Ward, looks pretty but has a range in her acting that only runs from A to B. This could also be said for a script that is totally inadequate when it is not dealing with cockroaches and sometimes unforgivably obsessed with toilet-humour. The cockroaches, one the other hand, are very funny and got inventive musical numbers along with some funny one-liners.

I originally watched it for Roger Moore's portrayal of Bond ( I first saw Moore in Cannonball Run) and for the killer theme song by Duran Duran (Dance...Into the Fi-yer!!). Back then, I was still a young boy, so most of the high-class\/secret agent\/storyline was over my head. However, as the past 15 or so years have gone by, I've grown to like the movie for what it is an action film with lots o' class. Roger Moore is pretty good as Bond, but the real credit has to go to Christopher Walken as Zorin. That guy is absolutely COLD!! Tanya Roberts looks (and acts) like she belongs in a porno video, but Grace Jones is convincing as May Day. The locations are cool, and the action scenes are awesome. Also, this movie has some humor thrown in, like the whole extreme-skiing\/snowboard from a destroyed snowmobile sequence, as well as the bridge-Vs.-police car scene in Frisco. The Golden Gate fight was great stuff to watch! A nicely done movie.

Exciting story. Well acted. This movie has every element of being an instant classic. Don't haggle about historical accuracy; just enjoy this epic with wild eyed anticipation. A story of love, vengeance and will power.Russell Crowe plays Maximus Meridius, a Roman general that winds up a gladiator after refusing to pledge loyalty the emperor's power-hungry son Commodus(Joaquin Phoenix). Emperor Marcus Aurelius(Richard Harris)on his deathbed wants to turn the leadership of Rome over to Maximus; but the jealous Commodus smothers his already dying father to death and takes over the throne. Maximus escapes a death sentence and becomes a slave; then a gladiator that avenges his murdered family by constantly defying Commodus.Crowe is excellent as is Phoenix. The two contrasting personae make a great rivalry. Connie Nielsen plays the sister of Commodus and the object of his sexual obsession. Stand outs in supporting roles areOliver Reed, David Schofield, Derek Jacobi and David Hemmings.From scene to scene the marvelous story flows and the music of Hans Zimmer orchestrates the many moods of the movie. Your heart will not let you forget this movie.This will be one for the ages.
