[{"date":"15 November 2006","score":"3 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Matthew Broderick, who has always seemed cinema's perpetual teen-ager, essentially entered into celluloid adulthood with Election, Alexander Payne's acerbic, ironic, and surprisingly complex account of how a seemingly frivolous high-school election permanently influences the lives of 4 people Jim McAllister (Broderick), the popular social-studies teacher; Tracy Flick (Reese Witherspoon), the type of caricatured overachiever we love to hate (she's even given an abrasive, tinny accent); Paul Metzler (Chris Klein), the woefully clueless athlete whose broken leg leads him to politics; and his sister, Tammy (Jessica Campbell), a lesbian whose candidacy is solely to spite the girl who dumped her. Election contains at least as many plot twists as your typical mainstream thriller, but the film is given an additional depth because its characters--clichéd as they may be--become truly three-dimensional through their pitch-perfect interactions (they may not always be likable, but they are brilliantly performed). But I am ignoring Election's key strength--its hilarity. While Payne has a snarky tendency to mock his flawed characters off-screen, it's hard to imagine a group more deserving of mockery, especially McAllister. As played by Broderick, he is a truly tragic figure--a man we can empathize with, even when his actions are misguided by the standards of modern morality. He turns a swollen, bee-stung eye and the beating of a motel vending-machine into bits of tragicomic gold that should have earned him an Academy Award nod.
