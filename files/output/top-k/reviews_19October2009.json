[{"date":"19 October 2009","score":"","review":" Run Lola, Run is a fast-paced kinetic thriller that doesn't waste a second of your time. It tells the story of a young woman called Lola who has 20 minutes to get hold of 100,000 German marks for her boyfriend Manni, who desperately needs it to appease a violent gangster. The story is completely unremarkable. What makes the film standout is the way in which the simple narrative is told. It uses the ideas of the chaos theory to tell its story three times. Each story features Lola running from her flat to her father's office and then to her boyfriend Manni. The subsequent re-tellings deviate from the one before, beginning with outcome of the decision Lola makes in how to avoid a lout and his angry dog in her stairwell. The seemingly insignificant differences here become bigger and bigger as Lola's high-speed run is knocked out of sync, resulting in enormous differences further down the line.With a name like Run Lola, Run perhaps it's unsurprising that this is a movie that moves along at a very fast pace. There are three alternate realities explored crammed into the film's short running time. It's tight film-making with no excess fat. The pounding techno soundtrack is highly appropriate in that it reflects the high-tempo pacing; and it's nice to see a film where techno music is used with some degree of purpose. The various camera trickery used throughout also does not feel forced either. The jump cuts and kinetic nature of the cinematography feels right in this story. Together, the soundtrack and visuals work very well together. I also liked the little cartoon segment that began each run. It was a nice and humorous stylistic addition. Acting-wise, Franka Potente is particularly good as Lola. She puts in a highly energetic and athletic performance. Her striking red haired look is great too. The rest of the small cast are effective too and director Tom Tykwer holds things together nicely.The central idea that our destinies often hinge on the smallest, most seemingly insignificant decisions is explored excellently in this film, with style and some humour. It's a trip well worth re-taking. ","genre":null},{"date":"19 October 2009","score":"","review":" Run Lola, Run is a fast-paced kinetic thriller that doesn't waste a second of your time.

Baum, from which the film is based on - particularly The Wonderful Wizard of OZ. I don't have any particular scene I like, because I love this film. The movie begins when 12-year-old Dorothy was walking home from school with her dog Toto. But Toto had snuck into the yard of the irascible townswoman, Miss Almira Gulch. Then he chases her cat and bitten Miss Gluch on the leg. Dorothy was upset that Miss Gulch hit Toto over the back of the head with a rake. But the two ran all the way home unharmed. But whenever Dorothy tries to tell her aunt and uncle, as well as Hickory, Hunk and Zeke, the farmhands what happen, they are too busy to listen. Miss Gulch shows up with a sheriff's order and takes Toto away to be destroyed by euthanasia. Toto escapes and returns to Dorothy, who is momentarily elated. When she realizes that Miss Gulch will soon return, she decides to take Toto and run away. On their journey, Dorothy encounters a fortune teller named Professor Marvel. He is a kind and lovable man who guesses that Dorothy is running away and feels unappreciated at home and he tricks her into believing Aunt Em is ill, so that she will return home. As Dorothy leaves, there begin to appear signs of an oncoming storm. She rushes back to the farm's house just ahead of a sudden tornado. There, she takes shelter inside the house, where she is knocked unconscious by a loose window frame. Then Dorothy dreams that she, her dog Toto and the farmhouse are transported to the magical Land of Oz. There, the Good Witch of the North, Glinda, advises Dorothy to follow the yellow brick road to the Emerald City and meet the Wizard of Oz, who can return her to Kansas. During her journey, she meets a Scarecrow, a Tin Man and a Cowardly Lion, who join her, hoping to receive what they lack themselves (a brain, a heart and courage). All of this is done while also trying to avoid the Wicked Witch of the West and her attempt to get the ruby slippers from Dorothy, who received them from Glinda. The slippers of course originally belong to The Wicked Witch of The East who is squashed by Dorothy's house. I love 4 out of all the songs from the film, which are Over the Rainbow, Ding, Dong, If I Only Had a Brain, and... The Merry Old Land of Oz And I always like when the Cowardly Lion goes Ruff! So overall, I would say this film is an excellent film for young and old alike.

Such as the fact that it spawned a TV series and that its soundtrack was led by the Irene Cara, Giogio Moroder hit, 'Fame'.Fame was arguably the first of its kind to portray and showcase the world of performing arts in the form of a feature length film. The lives, the struggles, the hurdles the students and some of the teachers undergo themselves were under the eye of the viewers.The performances were great, yet one which caught my eye in particular was Gene Anthony Ray, who played the troublesome yet promising Leroy. Angry, frustrated and at first rude, his character later became less angry and frustrated and more committed to his studies- not just with the practical in the performing but in the theoretical too. Irene Cara was good as Coco- the scene with her taking her blouse off while some pervy director was filming her was rather discomforting to watch-, as well as Paul McCrane for his amazing portrayal of a vulnerable but closeted homosexual trying to cope with life and enrolling on a performing arts school in New York, after he had been kicked out of the military when he told them he was gay. Ralph played by Barry Miller was interesting but at times, his character did grate on my nerves.The choreography was excellent, there were some good dance numbers involved and the 'hot lunch' scene in the cafeteria was worth watching. Another scene that was great was when the 'Fame' song was played and all the kids started rushing out into the streets of New York and danced wildly and without a care in the world. It was a street jam like no other.The only star to ever truly benefit from this in the long run was and is Debbie Allen- she later became a producer, director and star- though she mostly worked behind the scenes on shows such as Everybody Hates Chris and The Fresh Prince of Bel Air. Paul McCrane later went on to star alongside Peter Weller in the movie, 'Robocop', where he played a villain and E.R. as the judgemental, obnoxious Doctor Romano.British director Alan Parker shot this really well- he allowed the performers to dance, act, sing to their hearts content without wanting to interfere with and affect their styles.Throughout the duration of the movie, we see the various stages the students encounter during their 4 years- from their auditions to freshman year, all the way up to graduation in New York's High School For The Arts.Fame is one of those movies which caters for or is aimed at a particular audience that isn't necessarily the general mainstream movie loving community- it is definitely NOT for everyone.I for one enjoyed it because I have an interest in the arts- not technically in terms of being a performer because I am not one but as someone who appreciates that creativity and artistic expression can be channelled through hard work, commitment and passion towards what one does with their talents. Therefore, if you are an aspiring dancer, actor- or just someone who is creative, you might be interested in a movie such as this- though whether the events in Fame are anything like what it is in a performing arts college\/school in real life, then that is a completely different matter altogether.The 2009 remake of this movie was released recently and frankly, it virtually pales by comparison. As for the original Fame, almost 30 years on though yes it is a bit dated but it is still a great movie, nonetheless.It's not an outright classic but as a 80s cult classic, in line with other 80s dance hit movies, such as Footloose and Flashdance, Fame hits the spot. Isn't it a coincidence that all those dance movies begin with the letter 'F'? Gritty, moving and intriguing, this one is worth a watch.

Well, yes, of course Olivier and Caine lord it up royally and work at times as if they're projecting to the back seats, but this is still an enjoyable entertainment, all the more so when you realise your attention has been held throughout by just two actors.The film does seem to fall into three acts a la the original play, but the great director Mankiewicz does just about enough to open out the action by introducing us to the characters in Olivier's garden (at the end of a tortuous maze) and then making his house seem larger than life, with a massive living area, cellar and upstairs rooms, linked moreover by the imposing (and significant to the plot) staircase.I won't attempt to précis the plot, the whole thing is preposterous and could only occur in a thriller novel or play, which of course playwright Schaffer is well aware of. Underlying the complicated plotting is a critique of class snobbery, manners and eccentricity, but the whole is mainly a splendid homage to the old-fashioned ingenious mystery novels of the likes of Agatha Christie, Ngaio Marsh, GK Chesterton and others from that particular Golden Era of British upper-middle class society novelists.Although only two living characters are actually engaged here, the director time and again inserts images of the almost-lifelike automata with which Olivier weirdly populates his country pile to add to the strangeness and unreality of the unusual drama played out here. The house itself evokes a cross between some massive Gothic dolls-house and the house used in the popular Cluedo game, the overall effect being to highlight the artificiality and dehumanisation of the events depicted.The acting is, of necessity, played at a very high pitch and can seem camp at times, although this, certainly on Olivier's side, may have been deliberate. Caine is at least the equal of the celebrated Lord, but then again, cinema is the former's forte, so perhaps the main kudos should go to Olivier, much more a theatrical than cinematic performer (although a more theatrical piece you could hardly witness).There's just enough exposition delivered on the way to the conclusion by the characters to bind all the loose ends together before the curtain falls at the denouement and no-one will feel short-changed by that time. By the way, Caine was to later take on a similar two-hander on an almost identical theme, only with him in the Olivier part in Deathtrap (the late Christopher Reeve played the junior role in that movie), which I have it in mind to re-watch again very soon.
