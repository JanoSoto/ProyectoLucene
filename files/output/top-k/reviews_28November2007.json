It struck me as a too predictable and due to that not very convincing. Yeah, I knew people were killed in wars, I knew that there were atrocities, I knew some were accepting them and some weren't- what I lacked was some kind of higher self-consciousness of the characters, some above-average assessment and assimilation of the things, because this movie seemed like a bunch of robot guys acting, doing the first thing that came into their minds, everything happening exactly the way you think it would.This takes me to my second point- I really felt that some of the explanations, or ideas were stereotypes or lacked substance.

What was again very freak, Bunny killing that guy, or Barnes shooting the woman- it is supposed to show the degrading effects of war, but I can't look to it just like that. Those guys, especially Bunny, would have probably been psychos outside the war; their attitude is not one war can explain, it's a lot sicker than that. OK, we can understand that war brings out the worst in a human being or that it offers the place for otherwise restrained sick behaviors - yet as an other commenter on IMDb put it, too many things happen to that small platoon in a very short period.

Of course Guccione did some mangling of the continuity, but really, who watches it for continuity? And I'm not just talking about the nasty bits, it's just surreal all around.

One also would like to know if Guccione was simply trying to be a peddler of his wares or was he REALLY trying to make an artistic statement and wasn't going to let the suits detract him from his goal. Who could really know, even with commentary. Did Guccione ruin an artistic creation to make it high class porn, or did he really have a unique vision and dared to do what no one else would dare? Regardless, the output it singular, and that in itself goes a long way toward making art Art.IF Rome was like this and not just some revisionists puritan views of the time as a cautionary tale for their modern era, this is how I imagine it looked and sounded. It's like you are there, and if groups of people were getting busy, this is how you'd expect it to look. As someone else commented, it was much more realistic than what safely filmed depravity looked like in films up to that point.Also, one would need to put the movie in a modern context too. The movie came out well before the internet became fixed in most people's lives. One can surf the net and pretty much see whatever they want in a minute's time (to a point where it quickly becomes dull). The hardcore elements of the movie are therefore much less shocking to modern sensibilities. Softcore sexuality permeates the airwaves every day. Anything hardcore is available at the snap of the fingers on the internet. Seeing such scenes in a modern, and the relatively near future, seem almost TAME and have more artistic merit than the average smut out on the internet. I can see a time in the not too distant future, as the younger set become the middle age set, and barriers fall, that the uncut version will be broadcasted. People are simply becoming much less inhibited and the paradigms will shift enough where the uncut version will not be seen as horrific.In the end, I can see that many of the name people involved had some rarefied sensibility about what the movie should be. Meanwhile Guccione made an earthier epic that sucks the viewer in (no pun intended) versus previous Historical Epics that have great costumes and blowing horns and big sets and clattering horses etc etc, that are staged and bereft realism of any kind.

Of course the graphics aren't gonna be GREAT, this was made in 1992, not 2002 you primitive screwheads. CG were a relatively new thing still. So stop saying The graphics sucked. 2. The movie is supposed to be goofy, not scary. The first movie of the series was scary, but then they decided to take a new direction and go for comedy, hence Evil Dead II and Army of Darkness. I thought they did a hell of a job myself, Ash's lines were always funny because they were corny and random, he wasn't trying to be Hannibal Lecter and always have smart and sophisticated things to say. 3.

This season sees five new contestants randomly selected by lottery for the game show. The rules are simple &#150; each contestant is given a gun and a rifle as well as a choice of other weapons and protective gear. From this point they are separated from their families and joined by a camera crew who will shadow them throughout their time in the show. The winner? Well, whoever is left standing when the others are all dead wins their freedom and life.I remember hearing about this show years ago when it came out but I had never seen it being shown anywhere until it popped up on late night television the other week. It is depressing but the film is actually more relevant now than it was then simply because reality shows have continued down the road that they were on when this was made. Of course it has not gone as far as murder-television but with celebs eating bugs, Big Brother causing protests in India and many other extremes it is hard not to appreciate the point the film is making here.The strength of the film is that it accurately recreates the staples of the genre in the repetitive nature of clips, heavy voice-over use, trailers for coming next, interviews with the contestants and so on. Looking at the genre cynically you could say that the show also gets other things right &#150; specifically the manipulation of footage, the way emotional interest in the contestants is falsely generated and of course the way that conflict and fighting is produced to keep the viewer interested. This aspect of it works well and it really does capture the look and feel of the genre, setting it up well to deliver a scathing attack on the genre from the inside.Unfortunately it is here where it falls down somewhat because it is not as sharp or as clever as it would like to think. OK it does the genre as well as any reality show, but the ability to turn this on itself is lacking. Of course the idea appalled me as a viewer and that was the point &#150; that the viewer would question the genre on the basis of this film, but I do not think it asks enough of the audience to make this happen. In fact, once you get over the concept, it can almost be watched as a reality show of sorts and I imagine fans of the genre could easily miss the point of the film &#150; mainly because it doesn't make one that well. It will sound like a strange criticism but I do think that by hitting the genre spot on throughout the film, the result is that it is almost too straight to act as an attack at the same time. Instead it is just an exaggeration and it leaves the viewer to do the work.The cast are OK, no really good performances but they certainly deliver the turns that convince within what I expect from the genre (and I write this as a guilty but unrepentant viewer of America's Next Top Model and a couple of other trashy shows). Smith, Burke, Venture, Wever and Fitzgerald all do well enough without ever threatening to be real characters. The only member of the cast that really stuck in my mind though was Arnett, who turns up in a small role &#150; but he was memorable to me for being Gob in Arrested Development, not for what he did here! Overall then, this is a very convincing extreme version of reality television that remains topical due to the genre becoming more and more extreme and cruel, not the film itself hitting points well. However beyond this design and structure there is not a sharp criticism or message to be had and as a result there is not much of a message other than the obvious one about the path that reality TV is on and why cruelty or suffering of others should be acceptable as entertainment.

Well, whoever is left standing when the others are all dead wins their freedom and life.I remember hearing about this show years ago when it came out but I had never seen it being shown anywhere until it popped up on late night television the other week. It is depressing but the film is actually more relevant now than it was then simply because reality shows have continued down the road that they were on when this was made. Of course it has not gone as far as murder-television but with celebs eating bugs, Big Brother causing protests in India and many other extremes it is hard not to appreciate the point the film is making here.The strength of the film is that it accurately recreates the staples of the genre in the repetitive nature of clips, heavy voice-over use, trailers for coming next, interviews with the contestants and so on. Looking at the genre cynically you could say that the show also gets other things right &#150; specifically the manipulation of footage, the way emotional interest in the contestants is falsely generated and of course the way that conflict and fighting is produced to keep the viewer interested. This aspect of it works well and it really does capture the look and feel of the genre, setting it up well to deliver a scathing attack on the genre from the inside.Unfortunately it is here where it falls down somewhat because it is not as sharp or as clever as it would like to think. OK it does the genre as well as any reality show, but the ability to turn this on itself is lacking. Of course the idea appalled me as a viewer and that was the point &#150; that the viewer would question the genre on the basis of this film, but I do not think it asks enough of the audience to make this happen. In fact, once you get over the concept, it can almost be watched as a reality show of sorts and I imagine fans of the genre could easily miss the point of the film &#150; mainly because it doesn't make one that well. It will sound like a strange criticism but I do think that by hitting the genre spot on throughout the film, the result is that it is almost too straight to act as an attack at the same time. Instead it is just an exaggeration and it leaves the viewer to do the work.The cast are OK, no really good performances but they certainly deliver the turns that convince within what I expect from the genre (and I write this as a guilty but unrepentant viewer of America's Next Top Model and a couple of other trashy shows). Smith, Burke, Venture, Wever and Fitzgerald all do well enough without ever threatening to be real characters. The only member of the cast that really stuck in my mind though was Arnett, who turns up in a small role &#150; but he was memorable to me for being Gob in Arrested Development, not for what he did here! Overall then, this is a very convincing extreme version of reality television that remains topical due to the genre becoming more and more extreme and cruel, not the film itself hitting points well. However beyond this design and structure there is not a sharp criticism or message to be had and as a result there is not much of a message other than the obvious one about the path that reality TV is on and why cruelty or suffering of others should be acceptable as entertainment. Topical &#150; but not as sharp or clever as one would have hoped it could have been.

This though was quite suspenseful and did have enough anxious moments that you could say it works somewhat as a scary movie. Personally child actors are always a bit nauseating so I'd rather have a teenage heroine who can try and fight back than some screaming kid.

Also, his mask seemed too clean for my liking - as if it was an advert for Persil but his look still scares me more than Freddy and Jason. Despite these petty quibbles of mine, you still get the gloriously hammy Donald Pleasance and to this day, just that appearance of Myers at the edge of the screen prior to an attack still gives me shivers.

With an all-star cast of Michael Keaton, Robert Duvall and Marisa Tomei and more, they used there acting skills to show what the characters would be like in a real paper business. Well throughout the movie I have noticed that everyone is always working from sun up to sun down, this is a curial thing to make sure that there news is the most up to date as it can be. Throughout the movie they are covering a story about two African American kids that were blamed for a murder, except for they did not do it, they were at the wrong place at the wrong time. So throughout one day in the movie the Paper they were trying to see if the kids were not guilty so they can be the only ones to print the right thing on there front page.

With such a nonchalant viewing reason behind me, it probably wont come as a surprise that I wasn't expecting a lot from this film; and it's a good job as Blink is a highly disappointing thriller with numerous problems and very little to recommend it for. The plot is not particularly original, and focuses on the idea of a blind woman in peril. There is a slight twist on this theme; as the woman in this film is not quite blind; in fact, she is the benefactor of a breakthrough 'eye transplant', which re-enables her sight after over twenty years of being blind. A side effect of this treatment is the fact that she sees some things 'by memory', and this is a problem when she apparently witnesses a murder as she's not sure if it's real or just flashback...The film would be described a 'psychological thriller', and the reason why these films are often hit and miss is the main problem with this one. A film like this really needs a central character that is easy to get into; and while I believe that Madeleine Stowe is a great actress, she's not given the room to do much with this role. The plotting is not good at all, and is often all over the place; and too much of the film focuses on the tentative (and boring) relationship between the central character and a policeman on the case. This relationship feels extremely phoney, and since it makes up a large proportion of the running time of the film; it becomes a pretty big problem. There are a few decent scenes; Stowe is very good despite the poor material, though I would have preferred a lot more suspense, given that this is really supposed to be a thriller. The ending is pulled off fairly nicely, though its impact is lessened by the tepid film that preceded it. For a far better take on a similar theme, see the fantastic 'Wait Until Dark', and skip this.

The Oscar winning cinematography is sublime and breathtaking, the acting superb and genuine in a way that seems to only come about when performers truly believe in the project at hand as perhaps having meaning beyond commerce and thus being worthy of more than mere acting perchance even allowing actual expressions of soul. But here there is yet another great force at work, and that is surely the beauty and majesty that is the North American landscape in its unbridled glory. Having first seen the movie in it's original three hour cinematic release, I was moved in a unique and profound way that has remained with me for almost two decades now. Furthermore, I was priviliged enough to see the four hour Director's Cut some years later again in a full cinema setting. Here I felt the story was given even more depth and indeed some of the meaning conveyed originally to important aspects of the storyline turned out to make a very different point altogether. There is, therefore, no doubt in my mind that (far from always being the case) in this instance the longer cut is the one into which to immerse oneself into if given the opportunity.Naturally I have since procured a DVD version and was fortunate enough to find a release that provided both 'cuts' of the film in full wide screen format. This brings me to what I regard as a very interesting point. Over the years I have met a surprising number of people who have conveyed to me that they do not particularly care for this film. This deeply puzzled me for some years. Dare I say, and to my delight, thankfully none had ever declared anything even remotely resembling loathing. Naturally being curious as to how someone could feel unmoved by what I regard as one of the most moving of moving pictures, it emerged that every single one of these poor souls had had their first and any subsequent encounter with this masterpiece on a television. With the screen chopped off at the sides and all the other shortcomings of the now technologically quaint Cathode Ray Tube this outcome was surely inevitable for a film that realises so much of it's magic through the amazing cinematography of what can truly be described as sheer aesthetic majesty. Thankfully, large wide-screen high definition home cinema has arrived with excellent sound so as to allow the superb score some justice as well. In closing, might I strongly suggest should the opportunity to see this masterpiece in a cinema setting once again present itself, especially if you have as yet not had the opportunity, do yourself your loved ones and anyone you care about even remotely the immeasurable favour to experience this epic in the environment it was created for.

It's a very good movie, but I'm not sure what I got out of it.Basically, the movie is about the tumultuous emotional life of 1940s middle-weight boxer Jake LaMotta. The movie roughly covers the last 10 years of his boxing career to his early retirement years.Though it is based on a famous boxer, it is not really a boxing movie. This movie is about the internal fury burning within the boxer and how it affected his immediate family members.The performances are outstanding De Niro (LaMotta) and Pesci (his brother) played their roles with visible intensity. Moriarty, (his wife) also did a great job, though her role was a little more one-dimensional.I'm not sure what I got out of this movie after watching it.

So re-watching this film after many years was going to be a real treat&#151;or at least I thought so. Isn't it funny how time affects your memory?Instead of the laugh-a-minute, stunt-packed classic that I recall enjoying immensely as a kid, I was shocked to find that the film is in fact a rather tedious, poorly directed, mostly laugh-free effort saddled with mundane action. Apart from some stunning cars, and a few stunning women, The Cannonball Run actually has little to recommend it.Not nearly exciting enough (the car stunts are limited to a few unremarkable jumps, skids and crashes), nor funny enough (the desperate non-PC humour making light of schizophrenia, drink driving, stammering, abduction, racial differences, the law, and drug and alcohol abuse), director Hal Needham's chaotic comedy rarely gets into gear, and repeatedly stalls when it does.With an improvised feel to every facet of the film, The Cannonball Run gives the impression that much of it was made on the fly. In fact, I wouldn't be at all surprised to discover that Needham got his cast, crew and cars together first, and worried about the finer details (like a script) once the shoot had begun. The director and his Hollywood pals probably had a blast making the film, and I would like to say that the sense of fun is infectious. But it isn't.To be fair, a few moments did manage to make me smile&#151;Jackie Chan kicking biker ass, Adrienne Barbeau's cleavage, Jack Elam as a drunken proctologist&#151;but the majority of the film left me massively disappointed.The Cannonball Run gets a star for the kung fu, one for the babes, one more for the freaky doctor, plus a bonus star purely for nostalgia's sake. A not-so-grand total of 4 out of 10.
