If this film is about corruption, greed, narcotics and violence, by the end it becomes a one on one show between Washington and Hawke's character. What we care for, what entertains us through out the film is not its conventional themes expressed without conviction, but the squabbles between the two morally distinct characters as they visit the most corrupt places with the most corrupt people on the streets.Ethan Hawke plays Jack Hoyt (in a performance equally as brilliant as Denzel's), a man whose dream is to belong to the elite Narc squad. For him, it is an opportunity to fight true crime, the one that matters, to save the world of drugs. But before he can even dream of belonging to the Narc squad, he's got to pass a test and this film is precisely about that Training Day where Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington) will be his instructor, a day in which Hoyt will see that nothing in the city of Los Angeles is as it seems, and we realise the unsettling boundaries of corruption.Alonzo Harris, in an inspired and over the top performance by Denzel, is a charismatic individual convinced by his own methods. He believes that giving out street justice is what justice is all about, that the enemy is in the streets, outside the law and he has got to be hunted like a wolf hunting another wolf. Alonzo is clearly corrupt and does not go by the law, he is a liar and may be worse than the criminals themselves since he has power and they don't. The contrast between Hoyt, a man who goes by the law but has little experience in enforcing it and a man who doesn't go by the law but has a lot of experience in enforcing it is the movie's key appeal.The film does a good job of reflecting Hoyt's initial and later feeling about Alonzo's actions on us. Firstly we feel that this guy may actually just be a cop trying to fight crime in his own way but there comes a point when we grow to dislike him.The final moments of the film are the weakest point of the film. You see, what happens at Alozno seems collected out of a container since the only clue we are given for the possibility is shown a little past half way in the film. It feels like the director didn't know how to end the film and found a far fetched way during shooting. Having said that, I like the way the director handles the very last scene it doesn't force any unnecessary action but ends as it should. This is a film worth watching only to see the character conflict.

It just drives a man insane, and she proceeds to make it so challenging and leave everything to Fate - Jonathan Trager (John Cusack) had to write his name and contact number on a five dollar bill, which Sara (Kate Beckinsale) proceeded to use, and if the note comes back to her because of Fate, she'll give him a call. On the other hand, she wrote hers on a book, which she will sell to a second hand book store, for Jonathan to look for and browse at each time he passes by a store.However another serendipitous game in a hotel finally made them part ways, but parting is such sweet sorrow, and each of them take active steps in seeking out each other when Fate comes aknocking - Jonathan seeks out Sara's last name, while Sara takes a trip to New York, and both make round trips around the Big Apple, revisiting places they have been to together.Fans of American Pie will cheer at the small scene where Eugene Levy appears as a conniving anal Bloomdale's salesman. And I like the scene using the Godfather movies as an analogy which Jonathan uses to explain his crush for Sara. While the couples shared Cassiopeia, I'll never forget my own Orion moment.The surprising thing though, is that you might bat an eyelid during the introduction. Both couples have their respective other halves (engaged, going to get married), but proceed to flirt so closely and strongly with each other, and to seek each other out. OK, perhaps Sara's Zen-music boyfriend is a bit of a jerk (it always plays out that way yeah?) but this is a Hollywood romance after all, one that deals with a fortunate accident.I've always been a fan of John Cusack - he's one of those underrated character actors in nice quirky movies; High Fidelity's still one of my favourites, and the soundtrack in this film is pretty cool too. And Kate Beckinsale, OK I confess, is the real reason why I'm watching this movie. They share a certain chemistry which is so enjoyable you're rooting for them to get back together as soon as possible to experience the magic again.So if you're feeling in the mood for a bit of cruel Fate filled romance comedy, then Serendipity is for you.

Also, as long as I have been interested in movies, I understood that DAYS OF WINE AND ROSES was the story of two alcoholics as portrayed by Jack Lemmon and Lee Remick. However, I never got around to seeing the movie until just a few days ago when I rented it. Having watched the movie, I plan to buy it on DVD. For those readers who have not seen the movie, the story itself is as such Jack Lemmon plays Joe Clay, a public relations worker who enjoys a drink to relax. Almost from the beginning, it is apparent that he is more than just a social drinker, hence his constantly saying Hit me up! He meets a woman named Kirsten, played by Lee Remick, who does not drink at all. As they get to be friendly, she relents and finds that she enjoys alcohol.

While Lee Remick's character was not ready to admit she was an alcoholic, in the final scene, she DOES NOT stop in the bar down the street.

This is an awesome black comedy featuring some of the sickest slapstick I've ever seen in a movie, and loads of dry humor (example horrible demonic noises start coming from behind a bedroom door. Girl points to door and says, It's in there).The first half is basically a one-man comedy show starring the amazingly talented Bruce Campbell, who makes an idiot redneck into one of the most memorable movie heroes ever. In fact, when other people finally reach the cabin, it slows the whole thing down. That's my only complaint the movie is too long. It would have worked better as a short. For example, they could have done without the tiresome sequence of the girl running into the woods and the others coming after her (and no shock factor like in the first movie's version). I'm not watching this to see a damn search party, for heaven's sake, I'm watching it to see Bruce Campbell fighting off possessed body parts with a chainsaw and saying things like, You're going down! If your idea of a good movie is black humor combined with old-fashioned slapstick, this is the movie for you. It's a shame Sam Raimi abandoned stuff like this to make trendy crap.

I certainly wouldn't want to be left alone in the same room as someone Like Jack Torrance when he's having one of his turns! All throughout the film, the director, Stanley Kubrick's trademark attention to small detail shines through-from the eerily lavish production design (such as the deserted opulence of the Gold Room), to the sweeping Steadicam shots.Some have criticised the pace of The Shining for dragging too much, though personally, I have found that after quite a few viewings, it doesn't seem to drag anywhere near as much.

He also specializes in freaks (or more pleasantly, misunderstood outsiders); if you've seen Beetlejuice (1988), Pee-Wee's Big Adventure (1985), Batman (1989) and his critical masterpiece Edward Scissorhands (1990), then you realize it's the truth. Edward Scissorhands, often cited as Burton's most personal work, transcends its fairy-tale origins to become something far greater, like a mature cinematic masterpiece. Only true Burton devotees know why the film is so celebrated today, 15 years after it was released. Though Burton has made two better critical efforts since this one (1994's Ed Wood and 2003's Big Fish), it is Edward Scissorhands that stands as his most delicate and greatest masterwork. The film takes place in some quaint, unnamed suburb (that looks like something straight out of a '50s supermarket real estate guide), where local Avon lady Peg (Dianne Wiest), desperate for a sale, stumbles up to the dark castle located on the hill looming over her neighborhood. On her way up to the door, she finds the garden and the magnificent artistic creations housed in it. Once inside, she finds the remains of a factory and its sole occupant, Edward (Johnny Depp). The greatest, yet unfinished creation of his late scientific inventor (the late Vincent Price, in one of his last roles), Edward is a sort of Frankenstein monster, only he's not built from human body parts and he is not an object of horror but more of sympathy The Inventor died before he could give Edward real hands, so he's stuck forever with these scissor-hands. Peg invites him to live with her family down in the 'burbs, but she is in no way put off by his hands, which are comprised of razor-sharp knives and blades. I guess I shouldn't say it takes a while for Edward to grow accustomed to his new surroundings, but the locals are quite welcoming and warm to him (he even takes on the tasks of pet grooming, sheering, and eventually, salon styling). Why, he approaches adorability in this sweet, conformist society! There are others, however, like the native Christ-nut, sees foreboding in Edward's arrival, and Jim (Anthony Michael Hall), who is the rich, selfish and arrogant son of a local businessman, and who also happens to be the boyfriend of Peg's pretty teenage daughter Kim (Winona Ryder), sees menace in innocence. Edward is kind and benevolent but he's also human (somewhat), and is capable of anger and rage and it isn't long before various misunderstandings allow this dark side of his character to surface. Long before he was Jack Sparrow, Depp was Edward Scissorhands in one of the most recognizable roles of his career; who could have seen him becoming the top-notch performer he is today? As the harmless Edward, his face is scarred by the many scratches of his scissor-hands, making him incapable of touching anything or anyone for fear of destroying it. He has minimal lines but delivers his performance through calculated mannerisms and facial expressions. It's probably one of his first great roles. As for director Burton, he indulges in his usual cinematic weirdness (is there any other kind?), but it's given a strong emotional and human touch with a light dose of comic fare, which manages to separate it from earlier substance works like Beetlejuice or Batman. He focuses mainly on the characters, and their reaction to the misunderstood outsider, and his reluctant acceptance, more or less, into their world. Batman remains my favorite Burton piece, but Edward Scissorhands is probably the best film he's made so far (from a fan's perspective). Edward Scissorhands is a dark, comic fable come to life, and lives forever and ever, long after the lights in the theater come back on.10\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"9 November 2005","score":"3 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" No matter what you may think of him, there's no question of director Tim Burton's gift for imagination, invention, and his mastery of storytelling.

This DVD release has been anticipated by viewers everywhere for way too long. It's finally here kids...A coming-of-age\/ feminist\/ incestuous\/ misogynistic\/ black comedy? Possibly all of the above, possibly only a few. There are three key players in this Solondzian dark comedy the mother, the son, and the father. While son spends the summer tending for his severely underachieved (in the professional world) Ph.D. holding mother, he nearly misses his chance at an out of state medical internship while infidel father travels the country selling work-related training videotapes. Add a young teen down the road to question our protagonist's sexuality, accuse him of being too rough and a mother who stifles her son through critiquing his academic work and his sexual advances for also being too rough, and you start to understand that Russel's film is essentially about power.The fact that mother and son engage in an incestuous tryst is predicated by his tenderness in caring for her bed-ridden body. There is talk of childhood bath-time boners, and of course the vodka induced cheese throwing fiasco that precedes the actual act of incest. Incest, while expressed in sexual form, is about power. Mother attempts to exert power over her only child by seducing him, while her son believes that sleeping with his mother will in some ways kill the stranglehold she has on him. As a matter of fact, in one scene, he tries to have sex with her while strangling her. While the film is not ABOUT asphyxiation, there are certainly many players here who succeed in symbolically strangling the life out of everything that is normal about the nuclear family masturbation, personal ambition, and marital fidelity to name a few...If you're looking for a film in the vein of something Solondz, you're in luck. If you want to get off to incest narratives, check your local adult bookstore. This film addresses incest in a darkly comical fashion, but never once attempts to arouse, or justify.

And it wasn't without a bit of hand-crafted genius from Nicolo Bussotti...such trade sorely lacking, these days, I'm afraid.Go beyond yourself; take a step into the mysterious - see the film, and think about 'another world' right here on your own planet Earth, with all it's failures - and serendipities. We DO produce some good 'bling' from time-to-time....and I only 'tune' computers.

Keaton loves trains, and indeed this film has more trains than you can shake a stick at... not that you can really shake a stick at a train and expect something to happen, but you get the point. Anyways, not only does it have a lot of trains, it has a lot more trains than I think any other film (it definitely has more trains than any other film I've seen, that is). Furthermore, while I have seen other films involving train chases, I've very seldomly seen films involving trains chasing trains... and even the ones I have don't have as many.For that matter, this film seems almost Hollywoodesque in its train-chases and explosions. Lots of chases, lots of explosions, sounds like Ye Olde Hollywood Fare to me!, only it's like, way before that became typical Hollywood use and it's all tied together specifically by the great Keaton himself.Some people express a little dissatisfaction by the fact that Keaton takes the side of the South. I don't know particularly why he did that, but what strikes me about this film is how it also takes little pokes of parody at the great Birth of a Nation. Furthermore, his relationship with the girl in this case seems like a pretty good deconstruction of the ol' Southern Belle, and that's pretty funny too.I like this film slightly less than other of Keaton's films because it's epic. Actually, this makes this film technically at or above the level of Keaton's other films because of the sheer scale of it. I just like it less because it's slightly less Keaton, and he doesn't have nearly as much space to do what he possibly could. However, touches of his real hard-hitting humor still come through, like when he is sitting on the piston and the train starts to leave while he stares forlornly into space... I'm sure we can all recognize the feeling of just having to let ourselves be carried away by the world when it seems there's no hope for love.Thus, I give this film a 10 out of 10 rating for technical superiority, but 8 out of 10 reflects my personal ranking of it in comparison of other films of his I like. If you like this and haven't seen Sherlock Jr. yet, please see that one as it's my personal favorite.--PolarisDiB ","genre":null},{"date":"9 November 2005","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" This film is very unique in a lot of ways.Buster Keaton's particular style tends to contain a playfulness involving machinery and nature, and this film is not only no exception, it's more like the actualization of his oevre into an almost final, complete form.The key thing here is the trains.
