I remembered the first time I saw it, I hated it. Now, it has become one of my all time Top 10 favourite films. Agreeably, this film demands a lot of emotional investment from the audience. But IMHO, the returns will be ten-fold, if one is willing to give.(Spoilers ahead)I think a lot of people gave up on the show at the final point, where Sarah Polley (the crippled girl) refused to testify. That brought our conventional Hollywoodised expectation of a good ending to a grinding halt. Most audiences were just not prepared for that, especially after a prior film experience as harrowing as this one. Behaviourally speaking, we all seek closure in pain, grief, loss and suffering. So I don't really blame people who was not able to accept a film as wrenching as this one. Hell, I was one of them. But upon getting hold of the DVD by chance, all that changed.(End of spoilers)Like Magnolia, I enjoyed The Sweet Hereafter more in the intimate settings of home viewing. And so began my deeply personal, unbelievably evolving journey during those countless re-watching of The Sweet Hereafter (in fact this film has gotta be one of this masochistic poster's most watched film so far). Over the years, via my repeat viewings, I got to incrementally soak in (to the point of OD'ing on) TSW's tumultuous emotional complexity. I am hypnotised by its stark beauty and its harsh honest treatment of its subjects, its characters. I got sucked deeper and deeper into its empathetically realised fictional world, to the point that I completely lose track on why I originally\/ initially dislike this film.And guess what? I slowly realised that those minor spanners thrown into its works was not meant to antagonise. It was necessary, it was logical, it was real.

At first Ishmaël doesn't want to cause it doesn't fit in his Amish way of life but when his fathers tells him the community needs money he finally agrees.

For the most part, the film is fairly deserving of its rep.  Werewolf movies are pretty rare these days, finding a good one is even rarer.  And even though AWIL wouldn't qualify as a great film, the fact that it's among the best of its subgenre is a good implication of the lack of quality evident in movies based around lycanthropes.David Kessler and Jack Goodman (David Naughton and Griffin Dunne) are two American friends on vacation in the hills of England.  One dark and foggy night, they're attacked by a werewolf, Jack is eviscerated while David is only injured.  He awakens in a hospital, put under the care of pretty nurse Alex Price (Jenny Agutter), whom he quickly finds himself attracted to (and vice versa).  But the day he's to be discharged, he's met by the undead spirit of Jack, who informs David that he will turn into a werewolf during the next full moon, and will proceed to go on a killing spree.  The only way he can end his torment is to die, an option David is not willing to accept.The opening scenes, set in the hills of England, display a quietly creepy atmosphere (which would be evident throughout all of Dog Soldiers, the best werewolf movie ever made) that gets the film rolling to a good start. Surprisingly, once the movie settles into its London setting, it doesn't lose momentum.  This is thanks mostly to the budding romance between Naughton and Agutter, which is really sweet and believable.  The two also share one of the steamiest love scenes I've seen.Naughton is very likeable as the cursed young man, infusing his role with youthful energy and vitality.  Because of his performance, it's hard not to find his dilemma distressing and even poignant.  Agutter is excellent as David's new love, taking what could have been a cliched role and shaping it into a focused and layered performance.  No one else makes much of an impression, except maybe Griffin Dunne as the ever decaying, undead Jack.Much of this movie's fan base stands behind it because of its humor.  But to be honest, except for a morbidly funny scene inside a porno theater (involving David talking to all his victims), I didn't really get much in the way of laughs.  Who knows, I may have to give the film another look to get all the jokes, but An American Werewolf in London feels like it mostly wants to be taken seriously, and director John Landis packs in enough tense and suspenseful moments to make it work as such.The most famed aspect of the film is David's transformation, a scene that show off Rick Baker's superlative make-up work.  However, not as impressive is when the werewolf actually moves about while stalking and attacking its victims.

For the most part, the film is fairly deserving of its rep.  Werewolf movies are pretty rare these days, finding a good one is even rarer.  And even though AWIL wouldn't qualify as a great film, the fact that it's among the best of its subgenre is a good implication of the lack of quality evident in movies based around lycanthropes.David Kessler and Jack Goodman (David Naughton and Griffin Dunne) are two American friends on vacation in the hills of England.  One dark and foggy night, they're attacked by a werewolf, Jack is eviscerated while David is only injured.  He awakens in a hospital, put under the care of pretty nurse Alex Price (Jenny Agutter), whom he quickly finds himself attracted to (and vice versa).  But the day he's to be discharged, he's met by the undead spirit of Jack, who informs David that he will turn into a werewolf during the next full moon, and will proceed to go on a killing spree.  The only way he can end his torment is to die, an option David is not willing to accept.The opening scenes, set in the hills of England, display a quietly creepy atmosphere (which would be evident throughout all of Dog Soldiers, the best werewolf movie ever made) that gets the film rolling to a good start. Surprisingly, once the movie settles into its London setting, it doesn't lose momentum.  This is thanks mostly to the budding romance between Naughton and Agutter, which is really sweet and believable.  The two also share one of the steamiest love scenes I've seen.Naughton is very likeable as the cursed young man, infusing his role with youthful energy and vitality.  Because of his performance, it's hard not to find his dilemma distressing and even poignant.  Agutter is excellent as David's new love, taking what could have been a cliched role and shaping it into a focused and layered performance.  No one else makes much of an impression, except maybe Griffin Dunne as the ever decaying, undead Jack.Much of this movie's fan base stands behind it because of its humor.  But to be honest, except for a morbidly funny scene inside a porno theater (involving David talking to all his victims), I didn't really get much in the way of laughs.  Who knows, I may have to give the film another look to get all the jokes, but An American Werewolf in London feels like it mostly wants to be taken seriously, and director John Landis packs in enough tense and suspenseful moments to make it work as such.The most famed aspect of the film is David's transformation, a scene that show off Rick Baker's superlative make-up work.

Betty suddenly disappears (from the movie as well) and so does Rita after she opens the blue box.

The first thing that comes to mind is a chick-flick in which a bunch of uber-feminists discuss how much they hate men; starring Kim Cattrall, Mimi Rogers and Nastassja Kinski. Ironically, this movie is quite the opposite, but that's not to say that it's chauvinist in any way. As well as that, this is an ensemble movie. In terms of the ensemble, this can be closer resembled to `200 Cigarettes' than `Magnolia' if you know what I mean. A big problem that affects this genre is the unequal division of screen-time, colourful quips etc. that is given to each character. Thankfully, `Beautiful Girls' is one of the few films that avoids this problem by creating properly developed characters. Though it is fair to say that many of the characters are much the same in the `shallow-with-hidden-depth' type of way. This holds true to the overall shape of the film. At first glance, this seems like `Men Behaving Badly The Movie', but if you look closer, it goes beyond this with a soft-centre that brings depth and meaning to it all. Then if you look really, really close you'll find that you're back to square one, but try not to look that close. While it has nowhere particular to go, this makes the most of itself in its 2 hour running time as we meet a huge array of characters.Academy Award winner Timothy Hutton (Ordinary People) is a suitably un-quirky lead. Matt Dillon is compelling to watch as the hopelessly flawed low-life, while the characters played by Pruitt Taylor Vince (Simone, Nurse Betty) and Noah Emmerich (The Truman Show, Crazy in Alabama) are much the same, not that that's a bad thing. Michael Rapaport is thoroughly convincing as a sleaze bag, but then again, a dwarf is brilliant at being small (if you know what I mean). Fortunately, David Arquette's brief part is mercifully short and almost goes by un-noticed. Female support is top notch, in particular from Lauren Holly and Oscar winner Mira Sorvino who are impressive as the jealous b*tch and caring counterpart, respectively. Natalie Portman shows plenty of talent in her scenes, but simply doesn't pass for a 13-year-old. Uma Thurman's presence has a great effect and is good as expected as the sultry temptress. Rosie O'Donnell gets the quirkiest character along with some of the best lines (`Girls with big t*ts have big asses', `You know who you look like- Ally Sheedy'). But the parts played by Max Perlich, Annabeth Gish and Martha Plimpton just seem like a throwback to the rest of the characters.Tremendously original direction from the late Ted Demme helps elevate this to the next level. He gives it the required light-touch, bringing a pleasantly warm glow to the proceedings. It may not be in the style of ensemble master, Robert Altman (mainly because it's not a satire), but it gets one thing that Altman could never achieve- heart.With a sharp and witty script along with one of the best casts assembled in quite a while, `Beautiful Girls' is a fun `easy-on-the-eye' picture. This is a very good example of ensemble acting. While it is virtually without a plot, it still maintains a compelling pace and leaves a satisfying taste. My IMDb rating 7.1\/10.
