To be very honest with you, most of them, if not all, never met my expectations, but Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon was the first excellent martial arts movie, because watching the movie was like seeing a dream that was finally coming true.Unlike so many martial arts movie, the emphasis is put on the plot, the mood and the feelings, so that's why the story is so well written. However, James Schamus, the script writer, followed too much the rules for creating a martial arts movie, so that's why some people might say that the movie is full of clichés. For instance, how many times have you seen a martial arts master who wants to avenge his master's death? Everyone must have seen it a lot of time. After all, unlike what I have previously seen, James Schamus finds a very brilliant way to present, at the same time, both the love story between Li Mu-Bai and Shu Lien, and the story of vengeance without creating any long periods. In short, one the main strength of this movie is its emphasis on the story line, the feelings and the mood, because unfortunately, so many martial arts movies that were produced before Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon only focus on the fight scenes.Obviously, one wouldn't expect to see so much depth in a martial arts movie. Speaking about the cast's performance, Chow Yun-Fat (Anna and the King), Michelle Yeoh (Tomorrow Never Dies) and Zhang Ziyi (The Road Home) all have an undeniable ability to bring their respective character's feelings to the surface and the chemistry between them is so impeccable. Well, at least, we can admire such a great acting without cringing. Personally, I found this movie better than all the Jackie Chan's and Bruce Lee's movies, because for once, the movie director has worked very hard on the story line and the acting. Although the fight scenes are unrealistic, I was stunned by them, because I found them visually poetic, in a manner of speaking.Finally, I am sure that in at least 20 years, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon will certainly be remembered not only as a greatly entertaining movie, but also a very smart, deep and an intellectually challenging movie. Moreover, let it be said that Jackie Chan and Bruce Lee will certainly have a very low profile because of this movie and also other martial arts movies, such as Hero and House of Flying Daggers.

At least 90 percent of sequels are a waste of time and money, and often detract from the original.

First of all allow me to alleviate the common rumor or nowadays stereotype that this movie is boring. One simple unalienable fact that people must realize is that the differences contrasting between past and modern cinema are unlimited and infinite. The ever-present mood, emphasis and feeling that the 60s and 70s brought into movies is irreplaceable. In those days, if a movie was 2 1\/2 hours long, the mindset of movie-goers wasn't Oh, this movie must be so packed full of action that the 2 hours will shoot by like lightning. They were more along the lines of Okay, this movie is long, it is an epic, what needs to be said to us cannot be simply accomplished within minutes, things have to happen before grander things can happen, an we are going to be shown virtually every second of it. The one thing people tend to forget about space and space travel and space technology is that it ISN'T fast. It cannot just happen as if it were on a timer as in the movie atrocity Armageddon. What happens happens at the pace it does to perpetuate the un-deniable fact that this movie, although a work of science fiction, is as realistic as it can be, regardless if it's about the possible futures that lay before us. These days, the audiences have been dumbed down by so-called logic in movies. It must all be explained to them, otherwise they leave confused and angry.

Okay, so yes there were some similar parts (Kali and Skank both got thrown out of a window, Spider Monkey and T-Bird were both blown up, etc.). But it wasn't completely the same! Ashe and his son were killed, not Ashe and his fiancé. Eric didn't fall in love with Sarah. Top Dollar didn't drink the crow's blood and gain it's power and Judah did. The only similarities in the whole plot were the deaths (partly) and the basic theme (a guy and someone he loves gets killed and he comes back to avenge their deaths). But the point is not to continue the movie and replace Brandon Lee, or am I that misinformed? I think not. The directors weren't trying to replace Brandon Lee, because that would not be easy. He was the best actor ever. Still, why do so many people think they're supposed to be the replacing everyone? Admitedly, the bad guys were a little stale in this movie. Judah and the Sybil were so old! They were like some kind of tribal leaders. So boring. But the whole movie was (in my opinion) better than the first one. The Crow was way hotter to. And that IS NOT the reason I watched it; that's just a comment. Hey, I'm a sucker for magicians with accents. Sue me. Anyway, it was much more wild. The blood and guts part- I'm not into all that gore, but it made the movie better. Ashe was very manic and driven (headfirst into a wall 80 times when he was a kid) to kill because of his love for his son. Eric Draven was so emotional. Don't get me wrong, I liked them both.

The spy vs. spy craze was at its height with super-spy James Bond played by ebullient Sean Connery at the top of the movie ladder. Dozens of Cold War espionage thrillers were marketed that year. Even non-spy films touched on espionage from time to time. Adding to the spy mill in 1966 were several espionage television series including the classic spy spoof show Get Smart, created by the comedic giants Mel Brooks and Buck Henry. So to most movie goers of the day Torn Curtain was just another film capitalizing on the spy vs. spy trend. Torn Curtain, however, is one of Hitchcock's best with two scenes that are among his most intense, the almost endless killing of communist agent Hermann Gromek, played with skill by Wolfgang Kieling, and the bus getaway that will keep you on the edge of your seat. The crying fire in a crowded theater is exciting but predictable--the viewer is just waiting for Professor Michael Armstrong (Paul Newman) to jump from his seat and yell. Lovely Julie Andrews has a juicy role as Dr. Sarah Louise Sherman, the soon to be Mrs. Armstrong if the good professor doesn't run away and leave her. When my wife watched this movie for the first time, she asked in a surprising tone of voice, Is that really Paul Newman and Julie Andrews together? This unlikely combination works. It works better than the movies Newman made with his wife, Joanne Woodward. The role of Dr. Sherman is also somewhat unique in that she is unwittingly involved in espionage without her knowledge, following her fiancée to Communist East Germany without knowing that he is on an extremely dangerous assignment which only a nuclear scientist can carry out. Hitchcock's film making was beginning to taper off in the twilight of his years. But the masterful hand was still orchestrating film techniques highly original and creative. Lesser directors would have used just anyone to play the small but significant part of the prima donna Countess Kuchinska. Instead Hitchcock searched and found just the right person with the right face and attitude for the role. Lila Kedrova was chosen because she could actually sing opera and because her face and mannerisms stand out in a crowd. In her first appearance when she is getting off the plane, she becomes agitated because Professor Armstrong is receiving all the attention from the press. Hitchcock zooms the camera in for a closeup of her face with its distinctive features. It's well over an hour later that Countess Kuchinska reappears. This reappearance is crucial for the development of the film. Because of Hitchcock's methods, the viewer automatically recognizes the Countess, instantly remembering that she had been upset with Professor Armstrong because of all the attention taken away from her and showered on the professor. She definitely has an ax to grind.Though it has not received much attention compared with many other Hitchcock films, Torn Curtain is among his best and should be savored by all. Even though political conditions have flip flopped since 1966 and there is no longer a communist East Germany, this Cold War delicacy is worth a bite. Oh, and watch the somewhat hidden ironic humor at the beginning where there's a room full of top scientists during the Cold War and the heat doesn't work.

Even a contemporary horror would likely not give you as much 'weirding out' - this is as best as I can describe it. The movie was not necessarily SCARY so much as it was DISTURBING.

Not even clichés, but downright idiotic fantasies, such as Indian's eating monkey brains, performing voodoo, etc etc. And then the depiction of Kali, the protecting mother goddess in her ferocious aspect as a king of sub-Aztec monster took the biscuit.

Its quasi-scientific approach to fantasy (where time-travel is explained except where doing so makes the plot impossible) gives it just the right touch for a mainstream audience. The second and third parts of the trilogy were filmed simultaneously, so they need to be viewed as a whole, even if they were not released as one; this obviously hurt II's performance with the critics and at the box office.The strength of the series has always been as a buddy film Marty and Doc have a close friendship that few of us ever get to experience. They completely trust and rely on each other, and they only argue without ever really fighting or even hinting at betrayal. They can count on each other in a way that most of us can't, and accept each other's individuality. It takes a lot of trust to take the risks that Marty and Doc take for each other.Each movie of the series has involved the same characters in different time settings, and that itself is fascinating. Biff Tannen is now Buford Mad Dog Tannen, what one would expect a survivalist ancestor of the 1950s schoolyard bully or 1980s workplace bully to be. George and Lorraine McFly are now Seamus and Maggie McFly, a far more mature and industrious, and far less dysfunctional, couple that we would expect of first-generation immigrants of an era when there was too much work to be done for one to bumble around like George or become embittered like Lorraine. This Mr. Strickland is not a school principal, but a Marshall, and he is neither intimidated nor fooled by Biff\/Buford. Doc Brown is back as himself, setting up shop as a blacksmith and relying on his superior knowledge to see his way through that era.Even the humor is transplanted. Marty gets to learn how to shoot on a practice range that looks like his favorite Outlaw video game and dazzles the locals. The chase scene is transplanted, but skateboards don't move well on dirt, so he is lassoed. The space-time continuum is threatened yet again, this time by Doc's love interest, Clara (played by the well-cast Marty Steenburgen). Doc and Marty are again ridiculed when they share their visions of the future with the locals (automobiles?), and we once again find our heroes having to figure out a way to get back to the future. No one can say that this film or either one before it jumps any sharks, that's for sure. The story was amazingly true to itself throughout all three films.

Yes you heard me right. The original big gorilla debut in 1933. and this is a remake. Unless you've been residing in Mars, you'll also know that Peter Jackson will be adapting King Kong for the big screen for a release next month, and thank heavens it's closely based on the original.While this film also adapts from the same source material by Merian C. Cooper and Edgar Wallace, it has taken certain liberties and artistic license to change some character backgrounds and premise. For example, the film crew has been replaced with oil prospectors, and the blonde lass doesn't start off the journey with the team, but actually plucked out unconscious from the sea, an actress wannabe who didn't enjoy Deep Throat (don't ask). Gone too is the iconic scene atop the Empire States Building, now Kong scales the World Trade Center and hops between the two towers (alas, September 11 changed it all).However, this movie still retained much of the story's structure - team ventures into island, chances upon island inhabitants, inhabitants kidnap blonde lass as a sacrifice to the great Kong, the beauty and the beast sequence, the capture of Kong, bringing him back to New York, and all hell breaks loose.Just not quite. This Kong is quite benign in nature, and only goes berserk when jealousy makes him go on a rampage against those trying to prise his lass away from him. The effects look dated if you watch them today, and the animatronics probably made a giant ape hand - that's the only mechanical limb you get to see up close, the rest can be figured as a man in a rubber suit, captured using various techniques to achieve the desired proportions for size. Don't go scrutinizing the plot too, as there are gaping loopholes, and plenty of minor characters. Oh, Singapore's mentioned a lot of times in the first twenty minutes, as the ship crew navigates from Surabaya, Indonesia en route to looking for oil.Starring a very young and very hairy Jeff Bridges in the role of a professor \/ ape expert, this movie is probably famous for introducing a very nubile Jessica Lange in her first feature film. She could be considered as the Jessica Simpson of that era, having prancing around the island in hot pants and tank tops, various strapless gowns and in wet island garb, which gave way to a wardrobe malfunction when Kong molested her with its finger (don't ask - the ape's probably horny too).So while awaiting Peter Jackson's masterpiece, why not get your hands on this adapted classic too?
