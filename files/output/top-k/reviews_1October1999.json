Found it hilarious that Sinead O'Connor was playing the Virgin Mary in the hallucinations of Francie Brady, the young Irish rogue who plays the lead role, especially after she must be hated by many Roman Catholics -- so I rented it. It's a great movie! You find yourself sympathizing with a boy who likely has insanity running in his family -- as his mother is mad (and his father is the town drunk). The movie takes place during the communist scare and cheesy sci-fi movie late 1950s, and Francie blends the two into his imaginary world. A wonderfully made film with a humorous edge that works as Francie gets madder and madder, and to himself, (as he narrates) goes about as if he is the only sane person in town. The only shortcoming is that it takes a while to understand the thick Irish accents of the characters. I put this up there with City of Lost Children and Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas as my favorites.

Does he think he's fooling anyone? In Bob Roberts, his self-produced campaign-trail parody, he made it look as if, yes, he the sensitive statist-liberal knew all about supposed home-grown fascists. Now, with Arlington Road, he pretends to know about where the blame lies for home-grown terrorism -- and the government has -none- of it, nosireebob.The first three-fourths of this mess relies on the Neighbors You Don't Know Enough About That Drive You Crazy stock plot. The final fourth is an Idiot Plot, pure and simple. I won't go into the first type of plot -- it's been trampled on to hilarious effect by Aykroyd and Belushi in Neighbors, something far more enjoyable. But let's see if I can dissect the second type without providing outright spoilers.What kind of competent conspiracy relies on assuming that cars careening heedlessly through traffic -- especially the wrong way on a divided street -- will -never- be stopped by police? (In Washington, D.C., no less?) On having one of its principals beaten up, to provide an illusory personal victory and to fuel rage? On making sure that collateral murders make the six o'clock news, rather than hiding them in cement overshoes at the bottom of Chesapeake Bay? On having the conspiracy blurted out in many of its brutal details while partygoers are readily within earshot?I'd comment more on how children are manipulated and brutalized in the story line, to create no greater plot benefit than psychological terror, but it'd make for some outright spoilers. Besides, the very same excuses that Robbins's favorite politicos use for increasing the -real- threat of the State to our liberties all rely on protecting the children, and this just doubles the obscenity involved.(Incidentally, and this is no spoiler, any conspiracy movie that relies on the Bad Guys using the Liberty Delivery Service ought to have its artistic license revoked for Overweight Metaphors.)Not the least of the cliches is the overwrought music, never allowing a quiet moment to show its dramatic impact, not when screeching counterpoint can be added.I was bored for 90 minutes, stunned by idiocy for 30. And this time, I knew I had to stay for the pro-government piety that would be found in the credits. I wasn't disappointed. The Teaching Tolerance Project of the Southern Poverty Law Center was thanked by the filmmakers. The SPLC considers almost any prominent figure who disagrees with the everywhere-State, as praised by opponents of terrorism in real life, to be the near equivalent of a domestic terrorist, or aiding and abetting them. So much for the independent perspective of art.As for Robbins, he should go back to being a sex object, as in Bull Durham. That, at least, was endurable by those who possess artistic taste.
