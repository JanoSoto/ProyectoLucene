I really adore Japanese culture and history and I am a big fan of Asian cinema. I was looking forward to see a film that is considered as a masterpiece by many and has risen to world wide fame.I was surprised to see so many flaws in this film that I don't even know where to start. First of all, the movie is far too long and lacks of fluidity. The story is extremely predictable and develops no tension at all. The script is very poor and unoriginal. It steals several ideas from many other theatre plays and movies. One always feels that one has seen the same story elsewhere before and in a much better way. The beginning is overlong and should have been shortened. The middle part with the scenes in the field and the destroyed castle include many lengths. The ending is not well told and finishes too abruptly on the other side.The battle scenes are a complete fail. We see a shot of soldiers shooting in a forest. In the next shot, we see five soldiers yelling and falling from the horses to die on the ground. Repeat the two shots five times and this is what the battle scenes of this movie are like. There is no action, no aesthetic and no emotion in those scenes. It rather looks like a chess game than a true battle.The dialogues are amongst the poorest ones I have ever witnessed in cinema and I have seen thousand of movies. They are extremely wooden and sometimes so ridiculous that I had to laugh out hard. The scenes including the arrogant, philosophical and schizophrenic fool are annoying. When the old lord gets insane and just always says the same couple of sentences throughout the second half of the movie and shares many scenes with the fool, the whole thing looks like a parody in form of an old fashioned theatre play for kids. Some intellectual people will now talk about the irony that the fool always tells the truth and switches roles with his master and that the poor old man saved the fool and that this action started all the intrigues but this is no excuse for so many poor and repetitive dialogues.The characters are not credible. The movie tries to include many hints at traditional Japanese culture but these elements are exaggerated and don't seem authentic at all to me. The role of the fool that insults everybody around him but stays extremely faithful to his old master once he has gone insane is ridiculous. A man that shows this kind of disrespect would have been executed in traditional Japan. A woman like Lady Kaede would have never been so successful with her predictable intrigues. Any credible husband or brother-in-law would have given an order to execute her. The fact that Lady Sue could easily escape from the castle and go to her brother is not credible at all even if she got help. One would have followed and killed her and the traitor that refuses to obey his master and its sister-in-law would have been executed, too. It also seems strange to me that the lord's adviser finally kills Lady Kaede without getting the order by his superior while the lord stands next to him and doesn't react. I'm not an expert of Japanese history but from what I have seen from other movies, read from several books, known from history lessons and heard from Japanese that I could meet, many of these scenes don't seem realistic to me at all if I think about the severe code of honour of this country.After so many negative aspects, let's mention some positive things. Even though the characters aren't credible and the dialogues are wooden, it's not the mistake by the actors but by the writer and director. The acting itself is well executed and should be praised. It's the only thing that kept me watching this flick until the end. To give you an example, the interpretation of Lady Kaede or the annoying fool are well done from an objective point of view.At the time of its creation, this movie was Japan's most expensive production ever. Akira Korusawa was a big name and he got some good connections. You can see this by the inclusion of many supportive actors, excellent settings and especially many valuable costumes that are created with much detail. The film is quite colourful and beautiful to watch. Only the camera cuts are stiff and some potential is wasted there.Concerning the story, even though the whole thing is predictable, some of the intrigues are still well done. After a weak start and before a weaker second half of the movie, we have around forty-five minutes or so that are really entertaining and have some plot development. This is the strongest part of the movie.In the end, there are some positive points to mention but the weaker ones are in majority. It's definitely not the mistake of the costume makers, the actors or the light and sound engineers that do an almost flawless job. It's the fault of the poor writers and the headless director. Shame on you, Mister Akira Korusawa. Even a big name can't save this film that must be considered as a failure at the highest level. It's not the worst thing I have seen but still below average. I definitely don't recommend this movie to anybody apart of fans of gorgeous costumes and old fashioned theatre plays.

Any traditional western hero would have shot the men, or at least tried to intervene; but not here; he just watches then rides into town. After a confrontation with a group of men he goes to the bar and learns that they work for the Baxters, one of two rival gangs, the others are the Rojos. Observing that a man could get rich in a town like this he heads back to see the men then shoots them all. With four dead Baxters he goes to the Rojos and seeks employment. Things are quiet for a while; then the Mexican Army bring a shipment of gold to town; it is meant to buy guns off the US Army but the exchange on the border turns into a bloodbath when men in US uniforms open fire; they are with Ramón Rojo; the head of the family.This action provides the stranger with an opportunity; he moves two of the bodies and props them up in the graveyard. He then tells both the Baxters and the Rojos that there are two survivors who witnessed the crime and while they fight it out he looks for the stolen gold and takes Ramón's woman to the Baxters. He continues playing each side against the other until one day he decides to help the woman be reunited with her child; this gets him caught and almost killed; it also leads to a massacre and ultimately a showdown between the stranger and Ramón Rojo.Having enjoyed quite a few more traditional westerns recently I was surprised just how different this was, despite having seen it several times over the years. Clint Eastwood's portrayal of 'The Man with No Name' has become iconic; he is there to make money and starts a war between the two families to get it; he also has a sense of humour; it is almost impossible not to laugh as he asks four gunslingers to apologise to his mule! It is harder to judge the performances of the other actors as they have been dubbed into English. Another cliché avoided was the fact that Clint didn't 'get the girl' at the end; in fact there was no love interest for him at all... unless you count his love of money! There is plenty of action which all leads to a great finale. Director Sergio Leone did a masterful job; especially with his famous use of close-ups where a characters face would fill the screen to the extent that all you could see were is eyes and nose; this meant we see every nervous twitch and drop of sweat as they prepare to shoot.

The film made IMDb's Top 250 list (to start with the least) and holds two honorable positions in American Film Institute's Top 100 Laughs and Top 10 Fantasy movies. What's more it's regarded as one of James Stewart's greatest roles (Oscar-nominated), it's based on an Pulitzer-winning play, and the plot premise of a grown-up man with an imaginary giant white rabbit named Harvey, seemed ridiculously intriguing. Conclusion I wouldn't have dared to call myself a movie lover if I didn't have the slightest ounce of curiosity to see something like Harvey. Now that I did, I have the strange feeling that I missed something.I don't intend to 'play it smart' with Harvey but to appreciate it is not an easy task either because one really needs to focus entirely on Stewart's performance not to get the several elements that severely dated, starting with some over-the-top, corny and laughable performances even by 50's standards. Seriously, I couldn't stand Josephine Hull's constant hysteria and her bird-looking niece who'd throw herself at any pant-wearing human being. What was cute and funny became rapidly irritating after a while, and Stewart was rather the character who relieved me from the environing cacophony than a true protagonist. I don't think I've been irritated by a bunch of characters as much as I was in Harvey to the point it really distracted from the film's emotional core the relationship between Dowd and his imaginary friend and the way it influenced his social interactions.Now, I can hear some voices claiming But it was in 1950 and more recent films have dated in a worse way! Yes and I would even add that comedy is a genre prone to that kind of criticism, but this is why I had to state my expectations in the previous paragraph. Besides, 1950 was an exceptional year for movies with such masterpieces as Rashomon, Sunset Blvd. and All About Eve and even 'lesser' films like Melville's Les Enfants Terribles or Huston's The Asphalt Jungle were still incredibly fresh and modern so Harvey would inevitably suffer from a comparison unless you'd expect a minor film, but what a recognition then for such a minor film! Had it not been so well-regarded in the first place I would have avoid a huge disappointment. But let's have a look at the bright side of the film Jimmy Stewart.There's no doubt that the film features one of the most likable roles from one of the most beloved American actors. No doubt that there's a very sweet and gentle feeling reaching a very emotional pinnacle during the conclusion, and Harvey himself is the little glitter enchanting the film with a glow of mysterious eccentricity that would please both kids and adults. I want to say that Dowd, a man of such an unconventional kindness, is a character who never gets angry, shocked or sad, but I can't even use negative words to describe him for there's something that raises this man above all the negativity of the world, and the performance from Jimmy Stewart is so efficient that he almost made his autistic behavior extremely appealing. But he was not mentally challenged since the film reveals that Harvey does exist.So, what's left of the message if there is a reason behind this smile, this hedonistic and constantly positive attitude? Now, imagine if you had the possibility to have such a friend, able to stop the passing of time, to listen to you, to be close to you, to inspire you kindness and amiability, imagine that. Who wouldn't love to live a life enriched by such powers? But while there was something extraordinarily inspiring in Stewart's detachment to the gesticulations of normal people, the film reveals at the end that there was a 'trick', there was a 'reason', it was not disinterested. Maybe we all have a 'Harvey' to listen to, maybe it's a metaphor for our inner child, our guardian angel, I like to think that way but then how about giving a chance for other people to have their Harvey if Harvey prefers to be with Dowd at the end.I'm not a cynical individual, incapable of a positive naivety and I'm not criticizing the film for the sake of it, just to expose a sort of smartness without reading between the lines the 'beautiful message' lying beneath Stewart's communicative smile, But I don't like being patronized either or be taught a lesson. On that level, I couldn't stand the way Harvey was being too explicit about the niceness being the solution to life instead of more 'normal' behavior, especially since it never tried to challenge the main character, to make him evolve. In a way, the film reminded of another Stewart 'classic' that had the same frustrating effect on me, You Can't Take it With You or Capra's uninspired lesson about eccentricity being the key for happiness, as the perfect antidote against alienating order and social codes, but the film had a way to get to that conclusion.So it's one thing to have a positive message but another one to take it for granted without developing it with some solid dramatization. Forrest Gump also featured a sort of Candide-like, sweet figure, whose very innocence leads him to be successful but Gump was also capable of displaying courage, sadness, even hostility and aggressiveness, it was a multi-layered personality. Unfortunately, Elwood P. Dowd is constantly jovial, good-hearted, in a good mood to a point that flirts with one-dimensionality as if he was drugged by his own beatitude, and we can only assume that he's a good model but no clear action, no palpable evolution, helps us to embrace his view on life, to be like him.

Led by Meadowlark Lemon (voice of Scatman Crothers), and Granny, the team lived up to its name, traveling the world and taking on the weirdest, most unconventional, and often the most unscrupulous basketball teams - hillbillies, circus performers, surfers, bodybuilders, you name it. Each cartoon would climax with a wild basketball game that stomped all over NBA rules.

I have since seen all the later director's cut versions and definitive versions. All are worth checking out, the movie is more interesting the more you watch it.Set in 2019 Los Angeles, (somewhat ironically now) the film details a cop recommissioned to take out replicants, illegal clones of human beings. Harrison Ford play Rick Deckard, his initial reluctance and extreme accuracy are major clues to an essential plot revelation that is unsettling. Sean Young, arguably her best performance, is Rachael, a very special replicant made by Tyrell, the head of the corp. that makes them. Rutger Hauer, absolutely brilliant here, is Batty, the leader of a small group that hijacked a ship off world and returned to earth to get answers.The visual effects and set designs are among the best ever, the fact that this was made in '82 is astounding, it is in fact so wonderfully made that one must pay attention or be lost. Apparently many have been lost. The Replicants crime is simply wanting to be human, pure and simply, Zhora is trying to hide, Leon is trying to help Batty get answers from Tyrell, same for Priss. None of them act out of maliciousness or greed. Deckard is very good as his job, doesn't mean he likes it, notice his sidekick Gaff, played well by Edward James Olmos in an almost unreadable part, he knows more than he says. Deckard could deal with the replicants and even his empty, meaningless life in a cyber-punk LA, if not for Rachael. Note Harrison's line, How can it not know what it is? Telling her this is one of the cruelest acts in the movie, but Deckard barely cares, at first. One of the main points of this film, that many miss, is that the bad guys aren't bad and the good guy not really all that good. The noir feel and the mystery are spellbinding and the more you view it, the better it gets. Since I think it helps the viewer understand the film here goes for all those who wonder, Deckard is a replicant. There are several clues in the film, the unicorn that Gaff makes twice! the replicants are referred to as Nexus 5 and sometimes 6, my guess is Deckard is a nexus 4 and Rachael a 7. Note also that Batty knows who Deckard is and when he's about to fall him saying kinship! This plot point makes the whole story work, but it is rather subliminal. Much has been made about the revised cuts, like I said, I like them all. The quick ending is a abrupt but more in sync with the film, the made for each other ending more intriguing and gives a nice cap to the romance between Deckard and Rachael. the unique style of Ridley Scott and the heavy-snyth score of Vangelis plus a supporting cast that includes; Daryl Hannah, William Sanderson, M.

Batman Returns was considered too dark, so you could tell Batman Forever tried making it more kid-friendly, which I find very ironic since it was rated PG-13.Anyway, the film is about the Riddler, played by Jim Carey, who wants to steal brain waves from every TV in town and enlists the help of Two-Face, played by Tommy Lee Jones. While Batman tries to stop them, Two-Face kills Dick Grayson's parents, and gets adopted by Bruce. Two problems with that, however.

The film was released in the United States in 1967 and is the second part of what is commonly known as the Dollars Trilogy.Summary Eastwood (as the Man with No Name) and Van Cleef (as Colonel Douglas Mortimer and the Man in Black) portray two bounty hunters in pursuit of El Indio (Gian Maria Volonté), one of the most wanted fugitives in the western territories, and his gang. Indio is a ruthless, intelligent man. He has a musical pocket watch that he plays before engaging in gun duels. When the chimes finish, begin, he says. Flashbacks reveal that the watch originates from a young woman (Rosemary Dexter), who killed herself while being raped by Indio after he had found her with her lover (in Joe Millard's novelization of the film, the young man is her newly-wed husband) and killed him. The watch bears a photo of the woman and was presented as a gift by the young man before being killed. Colonel Mortimer (Cleef) illegally stops a train in Tucumcari, and soon after collects a bounty of $1,000 on Guy Calloway (José Terrón). Mortimer's gun slinging skill is displayed as he easily kills him from long distance. After collecting the bounty, he inquires about Red Baby Cavanagh (José Marco), who has a $2,000 bounty, and was last seen in White Rocks. Mortimer is told that Cavanagh has already been targeted by Eastwood's character, who is referred to as Manco (meaning one-armed in Spanish &#x97; see below for an explanation). We see Manco ride into town and track down Cavanagh at a saloon playing five-card draw poker. Manco kills him and his men, and takes the bounty. Eventually, the two bounty hunters, after learning about each other from different sources, meet in El Paso and, after butting heads, decide to team up to take down Indio and his gang.Questions What was so important about the bank in El Paso? Who was offered a membership? What was the membership to? Who recognizes the Colonel? Who is the Colonel? Where did the Colonel come from? Who was the Colonel's right hand man? What was Indio up to? Does anyone figure out what Indio was up to? My Thoughts I like western films and I like Clint Eastwood films. However, this one was a waste of time! Clint Eastwoods talents were wasted in this movie. There was no theme to this picture. I lasted about ½ hour before I loss interest. The plot was simple and it didn't take long to figure it out. Usually when you watch a Clint Eastwood, it has you guessing until the end. This one didn't! Because of the lack of interest and because there was no leading lady I give this movie 2 weasel stars and that was beginning nice.

In the film it depicts the C.I.A. doing virtually anything to ensure the control of the world's oil supply. The start of the film shows Redford (Turner \/Condor) and his co- workers as a generally happy go lucky team of book reviewers in a covert government establishment. The few people in the Book S0tore review books for secret plots being published within them. Turner believes he has uncovered a plot in a book. He is waiting for confirmation from C.I.A. Headquarters at Langley. Then Condor has a lucky escape from the death squad sent to eliminate everyone at the Book Store. He returns from collecting the lunch and finds everyone dead. At this point Condor must use his wits to outsmart and outrun the assassins whilst attempting to be rescued by his C.I.A. overlords. There are no super human feats of physical excellence taking place, just a little luck and a lot of thought. Turner aka Condor starts to see everyone as a potential assassin and as the tone of the film changes you can feel the anxiety within Condor. His background reading books makes his survival behaviour, quite believable. The film introduces characters very well and the background to them is also injected well into the plot. The film has a few twists and turns but never slides into farce. The physical side of the film is handled well and the few action scenes are well portrayed. Faye Dunaway and Max Von Sydow play their major roles, very well, in the pursuit phase of the film. Cliff Robertson's role, as Higgins, is a typical solid performance by a seasoned professional. The end of the film is managed well, considering the vagaries of all the possible outcomes. When the film ends I think most people of normal intelligence will have questions regarding the USA's role in world politics, such is the power of this well produced film.
