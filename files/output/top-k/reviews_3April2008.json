The film works because it is superbly written, impeccably performed and directed with a real, piercing scope of intelligence. However, the reason that the singular elements manage to come together and envelope us so successfully in a way that few films of recent years really do is down to the visual presentation of the text.Although Lars von Trier's The Idiots (1998) remains perhaps the most successful experiment in working within the confines of the Dogme 95 manifesto - with the limitations of conventional cinematic style used there to outwardly convey the search for inner purity and emotional simplification of the heartbroken central character - Festen's use of style works towards bringing the audience into the film, into the family; so that the darker, more mysterious elements of the script appeal more to our natural sense of curiosity and the voyeuristic nature that film, at its most basic level, presents. Had this film been shot more conventionally, with glossy 35mm colour stock, elaborate lighting and ornate production design the story, characters and performances would have still worked, but the overall sense of intimacy and painful emotional suffocation simply wouldn't have been so searing. The use of hand-held digital video, natural light, sloppy jump-cuts and lack of music create a sense of abstracted realism; tapping into images familiar from wedding videos or self-shot home-movie footage of birthdays, anniversaries, etc and making the audience almost a member of the proceedings (an innocent viewer, caught up in this painful family turmoil, or a co-conspirator, aware of every action the central character is about to make and implicit in his downfall).The scope of the story and the manner in which it is presented lends itself to this idea that what we are watching is somehow real; which offers the already engaging drama an uncomfortable feature that manages to question the very nature of what it is to be an audience. Of course, at the back of our minds we're still aware that what we're watching has been created; with the artifice of self-shot video being a deconstructive element in itself, especially when combined with the disintegration of the facade of film-making further created by the strict rules of the Dogme. However, once again, the technique works in favour of the drama, not against it; creating a film that is clever and satisfying on a self-reflexive level and also something that rewards and entertains as a piece of intelligent, character-based drama. Such notions are further underlined by the naturalistic performances from the talented cast, who forgo any ideas of ego in order to play these characters as close to the knuckle as they possibly can. It's pushed even further by the careful direction of Thomas Vinterberg, who has yet to produce a piece of work that comes anywhere near the effective brilliance and originality of the film in question.Although the influence of Dogme would wane somewhat within the next couple of years, being pronounced dead as early as 2002, the idea of removing all sense of obvious cinematic artifice in order push the emotional and psychological concerns of the story to the surface was an interesting one, and something that clearly worked, both for von Trier's provocative masterwork The Idiots and this fantastic film itself. For me, Festen is one of the great films of the 90's; a continually gripping drama about families and their secrets and a modern-day Greek tragedy of epic proportions.

Although Kentucky Fried Movie exceeded its own 33 times, it was their second film that gripped the attention of the critics and the public alike. They parlayed its success into the six episode show Police Squad. After Top Secret!, they went back to their short-lived television show and made the first of three Naked Gun films. Bringing back the show's star Leslie Nielsen and their signature machine gun paced humor, they crafted their finest work.Why did I spend 100 words, giving the background to this movie? The answer is that there is not much else to say without spoiling the hilarious content. I grew up on Abbott and Costello, Laurel and Hardy, and the Three Stooges; the first two are legendary and the third has a fiercely loyal following to this day. It has been difficult ever since for a comedy to impress me. There are only two comedies I have given a vote of ten stars. The Naked Gun From the Files of Police Squad! is even better than Spaceballs. Inept Lt. Frank Drebin (Leslie Nielsen) of Police Squad returns from abroad to the news that his partner (O.J. Simpson, when he was still funny) has been shot. We see it happen in the first of many sequences where we think the joke is over and then see it go on and on using wildly out-of-place props. Meanwhile, Vincent Ludwig (Ricardo Montalban), one of the most respected citizens in Los Angeles, has concocted an elaborate scheme to assassinate the visiting Queen of England! Thankfully, Lt. Drebin's boss (Oscar winner George Kennedy) and the rest of Police Squad have been assigned to protect her. That means Drebin must cross horns with Ludwig to prevent international disaster from culminating&#133;at a Major League Baseball game! I am a *huge* baseball fan, and the climax is the most sensationally funny scene I have ever watched. I even saw my hometown team, although Zucker, Abrahams and Zucker clearly had no idea how bad the Seattle Mariners were at the time. They do prove that you don't have to know baseball to make it into the Television Booth.From an acting standpoint, The Naked Gun is about as good as it gets. Comedy is an entirely different discipline than dramatic acting. That is why you hear about certain actors simply as comedians. Some critics and acting teachers believe comedy is harder. Nielsen is the king of treating outrageous scripts like they are The Ten Commandments. He has been in many bad comedies, but with the right script, few are better at making even the best jokes funnier than they already are.Also notable is Ricardo Montalban. He publicly mentioned that he took the part for money to buy a new Chrysler. I immediately thought of Sean Connery upon reading this. After Thunderball, Connery grew uninterested in playing James Bond, possibly from the strain of four films in four years plus the deplorable Japanese media's behavior during the shooting of You Only Live Twice. In both that film and the later Diamonds Are Forever, a role he only took for the cash, his boredom is unmasked in the two worst lead performances of the series.Such is not the case with Montalban. His facial expressions during the seventh inning stretch of the baseball game and his conversation with a terrorist whose name I would never wish on anybody look like they come from a man enjoying the part. The ability to keep external factors off the screen or stage is one of the fundamental cores of acting that has been lost on many talented thespians through the years. Montalban is not one of them.

Although she abandoned the faith several years after my own baptism, her upbringing left a solid respect for both secular and religious authority, something she took great care to confer to me. Consequently, when I first saw this film at age eighteen, I was appalled at its approbatory depiction not only of personal revenge but manipulation of the legal system. Equally scandalous was depiction of a Christian priest lying under oath to further this end.I rediscovered my religion around age twenty, and perhaps not coincidently, about that time began refining and deepening my understanding of humanity (largely though studying the humanities), of legitimate authority and of justice. Now, at twenty-three, I have left the United States. To some extent the lying cleric remains a bit unnerving in my mind, but strangely, the moral tone overall no longer shocks me.The setting may be somewhat familiar, even ubiquitous, to other Catholic Americans a close-knit band of kids in an urban (in this case, New York--where else?) working-class Irish and Italian enclave, growing up straight but getting into occasional mischief, as all boys do (I was a boy once, a good boy, even a sissy at times, but I certainly committed my share of nastiness). Life can be rough, but they exploit the loopholes and like all children, find creative ways to turn adversity into fun (for example, sunbathing on the roof of a brownstone building).One day, they take their fun just a mite too far, directing their excess energy against an unsuspecting Greek immigrant and watching it unravel perhaps beyond even what they had expected. But then, children are cruel, and a good beating here and there will put them in their place. (If they act like children into adulthood, they will likewise continue to be beaten and at that age if they go so far as to murder, rape or kidnap, perhaps they must be hanged.) After all, with strong families and a powerful Church to keep them in check, they surely won't stray too badly. That was the way of thinking for many centuries, at least.But not in post-Quaker America, and not in the rest of the West after we were done with it. No, according to modern logic, true justice means rehabilitation--which in practice means incarceration, even for extremely young, naïve (and even perhaps penitent!) children such as these. Incarceration, of course, means confinement to a rank cell and, too often, becoming the object of severe sexual molestation--precisely what is shown to happen to our young protagonists.I have always believed--and I still believe--that legitimate authority retains its legitimacy in the face of error, but I am not a legal positivist. St. Augustine tells us lex injusta non est lex, and the disgustingly tragic prison farce is not an aberration--it is the very foundation of the American system of justice. How can this be justice at all? How can it be truly legal? Does this government have any legitimacy at all?Thinking about Sleepers five years down the road, these are the questions on my mind. And there is one more, and this is perhaps the critical one for the moral tone of Sleepers was the premeditated shooting of Sean Nokes morally an act of murder or lynching--in other words, a mortal sin? I thank Christ I am not a priest and I do not have to answer that question in a confessional, because try as I might, I am, with my renewed faith, even less able to give that question the same straight answer I gave in the wayward days of my youth! In the past I writhed at their manipulation and undercutting of the legal system's integrity. Today, after all that I have read of entrapment, MADD, sex abuse hysteria, prison guards turning a blind eye to DUI-offenders being raped, and much, much more, I have to conclude that there simply was no integrity in the system these boys breached.I pray I am not wrong, lest I commit the grievous sin of adulating a work of art that glorifies murder. But, God help me, I know it is not the killing itself that is glorious--how could the taking of a life, except as the willing sacrifice of one's own for one's friend, ever be?--nor the perjury. Sleepers glorifies the exposure of a system that is thoroughly rotten and intrinsically damned--simply by virtue of what it is. It further glorifies the organic community the kids grew up in a real community, they were real friends and they came together, years later--their organic bond had not changed. If Father Bobby breached his duties as a moral authority figure then indeed he damned himself, yet either way he fulfilled his duty as their communal guardian.There are holes in the plot. There are aspects of the moral tone that are objectively questionable. But questions should also be asked about the system that is violated on this screen--and whether it is not itself in dire straits. I would say, and not to endorse Howard Zinn or any leftist revolutionary, that we may well be damaged beyond repair. Sleepers claims to be a true story and its moral indignation may well be exaggerated, but that need not discredit its brutally realistic depiction of true injustice.Injustice is not poverty in the Third World. Injustice is what happens to ordinary folk of all races, social classes, and yes, as Sleepers depicts and as disgusting as it is, ages in the courts and prisons of my home country. Sleepers is criticised, perhaps rightly so, for trumpeting vigilantism and dishonesty, but above all it is the story of an organic order submerged against its will into modern, routine and mechanical rehabilitation. Forget the fictional controversy. If it can make us long for a more ancient, primordial, and yes, civilised mentality, perhaps it is a positive addition to the canon of film.

Although she abandoned the faith several years after my own baptism, her upbringing left a solid respect for both secular and religious authority, something she took great care to confer to me. Consequently, when I first saw this film at age eighteen, I was appalled at its approbatory depiction not only of personal revenge but manipulation of the legal system. Equally scandalous was depiction of a Christian priest lying under oath to further this end.I rediscovered my religion around age twenty, and perhaps not coincidently, about that time began refining and deepening my understanding of humanity (largely though studying the humanities), of legitimate authority and of justice. Now, at twenty-three, I have left the United States. To some extent the lying cleric remains a bit unnerving in my mind, but strangely, the moral tone overall no longer shocks me.The setting may be somewhat familiar, even ubiquitous, to other Catholic Americans a close-knit band of kids in an urban (in this case, New York--where else?) working-class Irish and Italian enclave, growing up straight but getting into occasional mischief, as all boys do (I was a boy once, a good boy, even a sissy at times, but I certainly committed my share of nastiness). Life can be rough, but they exploit the loopholes and like all children, find creative ways to turn adversity into fun (for example, sunbathing on the roof of a brownstone building).One day, they take their fun just a mite too far, directing their excess energy against an unsuspecting Greek immigrant and watching it unravel perhaps beyond even what they had expected. But then, children are cruel, and a good beating here and there will put them in their place. (If they act like children into adulthood, they will likewise continue to be beaten and at that age if they go so far as to murder, rape or kidnap, perhaps they must be hanged.) After all, with strong families and a powerful Church to keep them in check, they surely won't stray too badly. That was the way of thinking for many centuries, at least.But not in post-Quaker America, and not in the rest of the West after we were done with it. No, according to modern logic, true justice means rehabilitation--which in practice means incarceration, even for extremely young, naïve (and even perhaps penitent!) children such as these. Incarceration, of course, means confinement to a rank cell and, too often, becoming the object of severe sexual molestation--precisely what is shown to happen to our young protagonists.I have always believed--and I still believe--that legitimate authority retains its legitimacy in the face of error, but I am not a legal positivist. St. Augustine tells us lex injusta non est lex, and the disgustingly tragic prison farce is not an aberration--it is the very foundation of the American system of justice. How can this be justice at all? How can it be truly legal? Does this government have any legitimacy at all?Thinking about Sleepers five years down the road, these are the questions on my mind. And there is one more, and this is perhaps the critical one for the moral tone of Sleepers was the premeditated shooting of Sean Nokes morally an act of murder or lynching--in other words, a mortal sin? I thank Christ I am not a priest and I do not have to answer that question in a confessional, because try as I might, I am, with my renewed faith, even less able to give that question the same straight answer I gave in the wayward days of my youth! In the past I writhed at their manipulation and undercutting of the legal system's integrity. Today, after all that I have read of entrapment, MADD, sex abuse hysteria, prison guards turning a blind eye to DUI-offenders being raped, and much, much more, I have to conclude that there simply was no integrity in the system these boys breached.I pray I am not wrong, lest I commit the grievous sin of adulating a work of art that glorifies murder. But, God help me, I know it is not the killing itself that is glorious--how could the taking of a life, except as the willing sacrifice of one's own for one's friend, ever be?--nor the perjury. Sleepers glorifies the exposure of a system that is thoroughly rotten and intrinsically damned--simply by virtue of what it is. It further glorifies the organic community the kids grew up in a real community, they were real friends and they came together, years later--their organic bond had not changed. If Father Bobby breached his duties as a moral authority figure then indeed he damned himself, yet either way he fulfilled his duty as their communal guardian.There are holes in the plot. There are aspects of the moral tone that are objectively questionable. But questions should also be asked about the system that is violated on this screen--and whether it is not itself in dire straits. I would say, and not to endorse Howard Zinn or any leftist revolutionary, that we may well be damaged beyond repair. Sleepers claims to be a true story and its moral indignation may well be exaggerated, but that need not discredit its brutally realistic depiction of true injustice.Injustice is not poverty in the Third World. Injustice is what happens to ordinary folk of all races, social classes, and yes, as Sleepers depicts and as disgusting as it is, ages in the courts and prisons of my home country. Sleepers is criticised, perhaps rightly so, for trumpeting vigilantism and dishonesty, but above all it is the story of an organic order submerged against its will into modern, routine and mechanical rehabilitation.

So it was interesting to learn that in The Field those problems have not gone away even though it's not British who are absentee landlords.Shot mostly in County Galway in Ireland, The Field certainly has the look and feel of The Quiet Man, but it's hardly in the same lighthearted spirit. In fact the priest in this film functions more like Karl Malden's priest of the docks in On The Waterfront.Richard Harris has been a tenant farmer working the land for widow Frances Tomelty for years and has raised his family there. It's pretty much accepted by the villagers that it's Harris's land by right of sweat so when the widow wants to sell no one bids against him except Harris's sidekick John Hurt. But American Tom Berenger doesn't know the rules around there and he does bid.But what Berenger wants to do is develop the place, put some Americanized shopping mall there. Imagine a strip mall on some of that beach-front property that John Ford so lovingly photographed in The Quiet Man and you can understand the feelings there. It all leads to a lot of tragedy.Originally Harris was supposed to play the priest role that Sean McGinley had and who played it well. The lead was to go to Ray McAnally who had done this role on stage. When McAnally died, Harris was moved up to the lead and responded with an Oscar nominated performance for Best Actor. Harris lost that year to Jeremy Irons in Reversal of Fortune.Also look for some nice performances here by Sean Bean as Harris's son and Brenda Fricker as his wife. All part of a very violent household.Religion specifically the Roman Catholic Church takes a beating and The Field does touch on the conservative role of the church in society. It's a generally accepted fact that the Church did its level best to discourage revolutionary activity during the 19th century after the Irish lost their parliament in the Wolfe Tone rebellion. Harris and others in the film comment about how no priests died during the potato famine that they don't know how the tenant farmers live. And Sean McGinley as the village priest is by no means portrayed as a bad man. There's also bad feelings towards Berenger who is seen as the descendant of people who cut and ran during the Irish troubles. Of course if a lot hadn't emigrated to all points of the globe, there would be a lot more trying to share the land that Harris wants to hold on to. The Field is a fine drama about Ireland and the problems there that may not have been totally resolved with independence.

For all of the hoopla surrounding THE GODFATHER films and APOCALYPSE NOW over the years, I actually think that THE CONVERSATION may be Coppolas most perfect, entertaining film. Coming out in 1974 at the height of the Watergate scandal, THE CONVERSATION is on the surface a film about wiretapping and spying on other people's private conversations. But it is also an effective thriller as the viewer is hard pressed to figure out what is really going on, even upon multiple viewings.At its core, it seems to be a very personal film about a man who has serious difficulty distinguishing fact from fiction due to his super-sheltered existence. Gene Hackman stars as professional wiretapper Harry Caul, and this folks, is the absolute best performance of Gene Hackman's career! And that's saying a lot b\/c the man has always done fabulous work. But here, you almost won't know that it's Gene Hackman. As Harry Caul, Hackman is extremely quiet, lonely, sad, sensitive, and suspicious. And Hackman embodies all these characteristics with 100% believability. It's one of the most perfect performances that I've ever seen. It's almost too bad he won Oscar for French Connection in 1971 b\/c had he not, I almost have got to believe that he would have won for this film, and he wasn't even nominated for THE CONVERSATION! Supreme oversight by the Academy.At the start, we are introduced to our hero Harry Caul through a brilliantly executed sequence of long-view, overhead tracking shots of a bugged Harry circling a park while his cohorts are in a building, on a rooftop, and in a van picking up the conversation between a couple that Harry is following. The editing in this scene is fantastic as it subtly shifts between hearing the muffled words that Harry and his men are picking up and the actual words spoken. They are speaking at such a whisper that you can hardly make out what they are saying. You also get a lesson in wiretapping here.During the film, we meet several of Harry's cronies. One is his very young girlfriend Amy (played by super-young Teri Garr), who loves Harry but hates him keeping things from her. Another is his partner Stan (played by the great character actor John Cazale, who seemed like he worked in just about every great film of the 70s). Stan also doesn't like the fact that Harry is so guarded and leaves to work for a rival. During a wiretapper's convention, we are introduced to one of Harry's biggest rivals Bernie Moran (played by Allen Garfield in perhaps the second best performance of this film). Bernie is extremely jealous of Harry and has an eerie, stalker-like affinity for him.Harry is working for some mysterious 'Director' of a powerful company (played by an uncredited Robert Duvall) and the woman of the park couple is The Director's wife (played by Cindy Williams in a refreshingly mysterious and sexy performance), who he thinks is cheating on him with the man (played by Frederic Forrest), who works for him. Upon taking the conversation tapes to The Director, his assistant Martin Stett (played by an extremely youthful Harrison Ford in an effectively creepy performance) tries to intercept them and take them from him, but Harry only wants to put them directly into The Director's hands. A suspicious Harry begins to investigate further and carefully tries to make out the meaning of the couple's conversation and concludes that they are having an affair and based on what they said, he thinks The Director wants to kill them.The film speaks a lot to the paranoia at the time due to Watergate and the disillusionment and general malaise that existed due to the Vietnam War. The film itself is an effective and thought-provoking thriller that keeps you guessing until the very end. It has one of the most ambiguous film endings of all time.

And I don't mean the Super-Spy genre with its gadgets and sly wit. In contrary. This is a very clever plot using many time and space spanning scenes. In short it revolves around a young CIA agent (Pitt) who tries to rescue his one time asset and then beloved (McCormack) from a Chinese prison. He gets captured and will be executed a few days later. 24 hours before the execution the CIA learns from his capture and, a presidential visit and trade talks ahead, decide to burn the rogue agent. They contact his recruiter and mentor (Redford) to fill them in on the young agent. This he does. Between these flashback scenes the senior agent uses all his wile he gained as a field agent to set his protegé free. The plot twists several times in unexpected ways and the tricks Redford uses in his scheme are simply great. The fine scene from Clear and present danger, where Ford tries to outsmart his fellow deputy director are but a mere faded memory from this scheming. The directing utilizes modern fast paced cutting and editing, but mostly in scenes where there is action. Unlike many other movies using these methods, here it enhances the film instead ruining it (I regret watching the otherwise great movie Man under Fire). Speaking of action, if you expect an action packed spy movie like the fore-mentioned Clear and present danger, you'll be disappointed. The only shooting involves a bunch of soldiers (first Vietcong, later on US Marines) and is only mere background. Most of the suspense is created verbally and the movie is filled to the brim with adrenaline rising suspense. The acting is very strong, especially Redford and Pitt, which seem to have developed a great chemistry. Having worked together before may have helped. But Redford definitely dominates the movie. His scenes are more than intense and when he unpacks his most dangerous weapon, his smile (in the scene when the nasty superior thinks he has nailed Redford) it is most memorable. I think this is one of his strongest acting. Summary If you read and like intelligent thrillers from authors like Forbes, Le Carré or Nichols you might already have devoured this gem of a movie and if not, go and get it.

And I don't mean the Super-Spy genre with its gadgets and sly wit. In contrary. This is a very clever plot using many time and space spanning scenes. In short it revolves around a young CIA agent (Pitt) who tries to rescue his one time asset and then beloved (McCormack) from a Chinese prison. He gets captured and will be executed a few days later. 24 hours before the execution the CIA learns from his capture and, a presidential visit and trade talks ahead, decide to burn the rogue agent. They contact his recruiter and mentor (Redford) to fill them in on the young agent. This he does. Between these flashback scenes the senior agent uses all his wile he gained as a field agent to set his protegé free. The plot twists several times in unexpected ways and the tricks Redford uses in his scheme are simply great. The fine scene from Clear and present danger, where Ford tries to outsmart his fellow deputy director are but a mere faded memory from this scheming. The directing utilizes modern fast paced cutting and editing, but mostly in scenes where there is action. Unlike many other movies using these methods, here it enhances the film instead ruining it (I regret watching the otherwise great movie Man under Fire). Speaking of action, if you expect an action packed spy movie like the fore-mentioned Clear and present danger, you'll be disappointed. The only shooting involves a bunch of soldiers (first Vietcong, later on US Marines) and is only mere background. Most of the suspense is created verbally and the movie is filled to the brim with adrenaline rising suspense. The acting is very strong, especially Redford and Pitt, which seem to have developed a great chemistry. Having worked together before may have helped. But Redford definitely dominates the movie.

Before its 1992 theatrical release, I remember the film being heavily hyped as Stephen King's first foray into cinema with a completely original screenplay (and as was true with most adaptations of his work--with or without his involvement--at the time, the reviews were less than sympathetic). Ironically, Garris would become better known for helming TV-miniseries versions of some of King's best-known works (The Stand; The Shining; Desperation), directing right from the author's own scripts. Needless to say, these made-for-TV works outshine Sleepwalkers, which simply further proves that King's writing style (heavy with internal dialogues and detailed, unspoken perceptions) is better suited to a format that can fully develop his themes and characters. This tale of an incestuous mother\/son duo who shapeshifts into bloodthirsty felines, roaming from small towns to dine on virgin prey, is fairly decent for the first 50 minutes--King's use of 'local color' (and the resulting humor) is well-rendered, and Garris does a fine job of creating an atmosphere of mystery and intrigue. But just when Sleepwalkers seems headed for the zone of good (if not truly memorable) King adaptations, its final third devolves into overblown, ridiculous action sequences (as though the producers chopped away 30 pages of King's script for explosions and shootouts) and a queasy imbalance between absurd humor and sentimental melodrama. The end result hobbles the overall experience--had King's ideas been thoroughly fleshed-out, Sleepwalkers may have been a solid entry in his filmography...but as it stands, it feels like a lament over what could have been. The cats are incredibly cute, though.

And it's not so much the story itself, but the way it unfolds with its introduction of characters which are alternately detailed and murky, but done in a style that keeps you glued to the screen and greedily anticipating what's going to happen. Tarantino's story centers around the title character, a 44-year old flight attendant (Pam Grier) whose double life and shady past are the linchpin of an elaborate story of her struggle to get out from under the thumb of a sleazy weapons dealer (flawlessly portrayed by Samuel L. Jackson). Once again, Tarantino tells his story from the far reaching points of an octagon, where each point of the octagon appears to have no connection to the next but it all manages to flow into one smoothly executed climax displayed from several points of view. Tarantino's deft screenplay rivals his Oscar-winning PULP FICTION screenplay and his direction is as stylish as ever. As always, Tarantino's penchant for stunt casting pays off, especially with the casting of 70's action heroine Grier (who still looks fantastic) in the title role. Grier is smart, sexy, and completely commands the screen without ever going over the top. Tarantino also revived the near comatose career of Robert Forster by casting him as Max Cherry, the cool-headed bails bondsman who befriends Jackie. Forster's smooth and controlled performance actually earned him an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor, though the whole cast works at Oscar level. Also providing solid support are Michael Keaton (one of his best performances), Michael Bowen, Bridget Fonda, Chris Tucker, and especially Robert De Nio, having a ball playing Jackson's old buddy who re-enters his life. And it's all backed up by some of the most amazing Motown music from the 1960's that will evoke memories by itself. Tarantino and company hit a bullseye here.

But as for the people who say that it's not important that it be true to the mythology, that's not what us myth-lovers are complaining about. At least for me. I don't know about the rest of them. I am complaining that with this movie Disney took a great story and Christianized it. They corrupted it, they took all of the decency out of it. This movie is to the myth what saccharine is to sugar. And I say that not only because artificial sweetener will never be better than the real thing, but because this movie is in fact nauseatingly saccharine in its adaptation. Just a few ways in which this movie was Christianized and had all of the punch taken out of the real story for one, Hera is NOT Hercules' mother, she is the one trying to kill him. But of course, in a Disney movie we have to have the happy family, right? And since we need a new villain, hm, let's see...why not just pin it on the lord of the underworld? Who, I might add, has no demonic connotations in Greek myth and whose only appearance in the Hercules story is when Hercules is tasked to bring Cerberus from Hades and back to the king alive. In the end of the real story, Hercules is driven mad by Hera and kills his wife, Meg, and his entire family. This kind of interpretation makes me sick because it's just another example of society thinking that children can't handle anything remotely serious. But, to end on an up note, the music was catchy.

Simply because it takes place on it, the wacky suicide attempt scene on the Golden Gate bridge is one of my personal favorites in the picture.Storywise, Dean Jones stars as Jim Douglas, a depressed and washed-up racing driver. In a posh automobile shop owned by Peter Thorndyke (David Tomlinson is wickedly funny!!!) Douglas meets Herbie, a white Volkswagen that was returned that day by a lady who was having problems with it. Thorndyke kicks the little car viciously, and when Douglas stands up for the VW, the little car decides that it wants Douglas for its owner.It's true, you don't get a concrete explanation why Herbie is alive with a mind of his own. The closest thing you get is Eastern philosophy from Douglas's friend and racing assistant, Tennessee Steinmetz (the lovable Buddy Hackett) a Jewish man who learned, while on a trip to Tibet that life is everywhere, even in mechanical objects like traffic lights and cars.When Douglas discovers that Herbie not only has a few problems that a little adjusting can fix, but that the car is capable of amazing speeds, he re-enters auto racing and is soon collecting trophies and prizes.Douglas has yet to learn, from Tennessee, his new friend Carole (Michelle Lee) and from Herbie himself, that in the quest for validation in life, some people are capable of selfishness and stepping on others' feelings. The somewhat arrogant Douglas refuses to believe that Herbie is a living thing, that it is only a car, and that it can be replaced...especially if it fails to perform to standard. Walter Pidgeon's character in BIG RED was similar. Once Red didn't win a dog show, the guy sold him.When Herbie destroys a gorgeous candy-apple red Lamborghini within minutes of Douglas bringing it home, the human finally understands what is going on, and goes through a huge transformation with Herbie.Yes, yes, it's a comedy. I know. It's loads of fun and Tomlinson has the best lines of all. Even hearing him scream, HAVERSHAW!!! is a joy, as well as seeing Herbie poop and pee on him in retaliation for his dirty tricks! A true comedy classic.
