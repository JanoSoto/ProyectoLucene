Story is about Tom Wingo (Nick Nolte) who has to talk to his suicidal sister's psychiatrist Susan Lowenstein (Barbra Streisand). In order to help his sister Savannah (Melinda Dillon) Tom must remember few things from his childhood that he put deep inside.Streisand made good movie and first role of Tom Wingo was offered to Kevin Costner. I'm glad that Costner didn't act in this one. I'm saying this because in my opinion Nick Nolte did excellent job. He was nominated for Oscar in 1991. but he couldn't hope for winning because he got great competition in Anthony Hopkins, who was brilliant as Hannibal Lecter in Silence Of The Lambs. Nolte didn't win Oscar but this is one of his finest performances. Barbra Streisand is miles away from Nolte's performance but her role isn't that hard to do. Kate Nelligan was very good as mother of Wingo family (also nomination for Oscar).In some parts movie isn't realistic but in whole it is very good. Maybe you will feel that movie is a bit long but it is quite impossible to make short adaptation of such complex book.

The inspiration behind this film is an interesting one. In 1975, there was a boxing match world the World Heavyweight Championship between Muhammad Ali (champion) and New Jersey club fighter Chuck Wepner (challenger). Nobody gave Wepner a chance; everyone thought Ali would knock him in less than 3 rounds. However, Wepner fought hard and went through 14 hard rounds with Ali, until being knocked out in the 15th and final round. Wepner even managed to knock down Ali in 9th round. Now you're probably asking yourselves? What does this have to do with Rocky? Well, you see everyone is an underdog in some ways, just like Chuck Wepner and the title character, Rocky is no exception. This is film is a great underdog story.The title character Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) is a Philadelphia club fighter, who really isn't making much doing what he's doing. Everyone, including his own trainer Mickey (Burgess Meredith) sees him as being a bum fighter. Outside of boxing, Rocky makes a living by collecting money for the local loan shark, Gazzo (Joe Spinell). Meanwhile, Rocky has an interest for his best friend Paulie's (Burt Young) sister Adrian (Talia Shire), who works in a pet shop across the street from the boxing gym Rocky works out in. Every time Rocky tries to talk to her, she doesn't seem interested, that's when he turns to Paulie to help him out. Eventually, Rocky and Adrian go on date on Thanksgiving. The highlight of that date is a wonderful scene where Rocky and Adrian go ice skating, and make a connection with each other. Soon after, they are considered to be a couple.Meanwhile, the current World Heavyweight Champion Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) has a title defense coming up. However, his opponent ends up getting an injury that ends up canceling that fight. Now Creed and fight promoter, Jergens (Thayer David) are franticly trying to find a replacement opponent for Creed. They eventually find Rocky. Jergens and Creed's trainer (Tony Burton) don't like the idea of Creed fighting an unknown fighter. However, Creed is insisting that Rocky would be the perfect opponent as he's an underdog and America loves underdogs. Also, Creed claims it will be an easy fight, as he believes that will Drop him in 3. When the offer is bought up to Rocky about the fight, he first declines. However, Jergens convinces Rocky to take the fight, and does.Now, all the sports writers and fight fans, are wondering why Creed would pick an unknown fighter, which they feel has no virtually chance at winning. However, Rocky believes in himself as does Adrian, who gives Rocky a huge amount of support. Rocky just wants to prove that he can go the distance. Can he do it? Rocky is a wonderful film. Stallone has done a great job at writing this underdog story. There are some excellent performances by Sylvester Stallone, Talia Shire, Burt Young, and Burgess Meredith. I'm not saying this, because it's my favorite film of all time, I'm saying it because it's true. There is even one particularly great scene that makes you want to jump up and cheers for Rocky. The fight scene is also very good; it plays out like a real boxing match, and doesn't go too over the top as a Hollywood fight. Everyone is in some ways an underdog. Rocky shows that if you work hard, you can accomplish anything and be able to go the distance. This is without question Sylvester Stallone's best film.

Lewis along with three friends, Ed Gentry (Jon Voight), Drew Ballinger (Ronny Cox) & Bobby Trippe (Ned Beatty) all travel down to the river & intend to canoe to a small town called Aintry at it's end where their cars will be waiting. However while en route Bobby & Ed stop off for a breather & are held at gunpoint by two local psychotic hillbillies (Bill McKinney & Herbert 'Cowboy' Coward) one of whom rapes Bobby up the bum, nice. Luckily Lewis & his trusty bow & arrows come to their rescue as he kills the rapist although the second hillbilly gets away, decisions need to be made as the men have to work out what to do with a dead body & the potential threat of more rapist hillbillies on the way...Produced & directed by John Boorman, originally Sam Peckinpah wanted to direct it but Boorman brought the rights to the novel before he had the chance & made Straw Dogs (1971) instead, & I have to say I was incredibly disappointed by what is regarded as some sort of classic. The script by James Dickey was based on his own novel of the same name & he also has a role in the film as the fat Sheriff at the end, personally I think it's far too slow, it's just too ambiguous & simply not enough happens over it's 110 odd minutes. The thing takes forever to get started, virtually nothing happens for 45 minutes at which point Bobby is made to squeal like a pig while raped in the films most notorious scene but it lasts for a few seconds isn't exploitative enough & not enough emphasis is put on it while after that the rest of the film is just the men canoing down the river before an incredibly long drawn out & throughly unnecessary ending which lasts for about 20 minutes too long. Deliverance might have been watchable if it had a bit of pace & had some sort of twist ending but it doesn't & in the end it isn't. This is an OK way to pass the time & you always have that feeling that something might happen although ultimately it never does. Then there's the scene with Drew just falling out of the canoe, the makers wanted the reasons behind this left to out imaginations but without knowing why he died or how you can't feel anything for him, well I didn't anyway.Director Boorman does alright even if the day-for-night shots are amongst the worst I've ever seen. I think it was a bad decision to completely sideline Lewis from the second half of the film, he was the only decent character in the whole thing until that point & we are left with the dull Ed & the squealing Bobby who gets over being ar*e raped quite quickly. Not much really happens & I never felt they were in that much danger either, as long as they followed the river they would be safe. Apparently Burt Reynolds broke his coccyx going down the rapids when his canoe capsized, now that's suffering for your art. The famous 'duelling banjos' scene (even though one is a guitar) was the very first scene shot & apparently the rest of Deliverance was shot almost entirely in sequence as it would appear on screen, amazing eh? Forget about any violence or gore as this is really rather tame.With a supposed budget of about $2,000,000 the production apparently wasn't insured to cut costs, a somewhat dangerous thing to do since Reynolds broke his leg. Deliverance was shot on the Chattooga River which divided Georgia & South Carolina, amazingly the following year apparently 31 people drowned trying to travel the stretch of river featured in the film, isn't that the stupidest thing you've ever heard? Serves them right I say. Anyway, it's well made with some nice 2351 scope location photography. The acting is strong from a good cast who all went on to achieve success in their own rights.Deliverance was a huge disappointment for me, it's watchable I suppose but it's just too boring & uneventful for me to really like it. I didn't find it exciting, disturbing or thrilling so there you have it, lots of people do seem to like it & that's fine with me but it's not anything I have any great fondness for.

Lewis along with three friends, Ed Gentry (Jon Voight), Drew Ballinger (Ronny Cox) & Bobby Trippe (Ned Beatty) all travel down to the river & intend to canoe to a small town called Aintry at it's end where their cars will be waiting. However while en route Bobby & Ed stop off for a breather & are held at gunpoint by two local psychotic hillbillies (Bill McKinney & Herbert 'Cowboy' Coward) one of whom rapes Bobby up the bum, nice. Luckily Lewis & his trusty bow & arrows come to their rescue as he kills the rapist although the second hillbilly gets away, decisions need to be made as the men have to work out what to do with a dead body & the potential threat of more rapist hillbillies on the way...Produced & directed by John Boorman, originally Sam Peckinpah wanted to direct it but Boorman brought the rights to the novel before he had the chance & made Straw Dogs (1971) instead, & I have to say I was incredibly disappointed by what is regarded as some sort of classic. The script by James Dickey was based on his own novel of the same name & he also has a role in the film as the fat Sheriff at the end, personally I think it's far too slow, it's just too ambiguous & simply not enough happens over it's 110 odd minutes. The thing takes forever to get started, virtually nothing happens for 45 minutes at which point Bobby is made to squeal like a pig while raped in the films most notorious scene but it lasts for a few seconds isn't exploitative enough & not enough emphasis is put on it while after that the rest of the film is just the men canoing down the river before an incredibly long drawn out & throughly unnecessary ending which lasts for about 20 minutes too long. Deliverance might have been watchable if it had a bit of pace & had some sort of twist ending but it doesn't & in the end it isn't. This is an OK way to pass the time & you always have that feeling that something might happen although ultimately it never does.

low opinion of this movie.for sure it's a departure from the first two,which were directed by Tim Burton.this time out,Joel Schumacher takes over the reins.obviously his style is different then Burton's but that isn't necessarily a bad thing.one big difference is the look of the film.it's much more colourful,vibrantly so.the tone isn't as dark,but the film to me has an even greater sense of tragedy than the two previous.we get more of a feel for how tortured Bruce Wayne(played by Val Kilmer) is.KIlmer is very effective in the dual role.he has a natural screen presence and a sense of authority about him.(possible minor spoiler ahead,maybe)he also gets a partner,who becomes Robin,which adds a new element,bringing out feelings of guilt in Bruce.The love interest(played by Nicole Kidman)in this installment is much more substantial as well,and i liked the romantic tension and interplay between Bruce\/Batman and her.Kidman adds a touch of class to the proceedings,which says a lot because i am generally not a fan.The two main villains come in the form of Two-face, a homicidal split personality played by Tommy Lee Jones,and The Riddler,played by JIim Carrey.both seemed to have a lot of fun with their respective roles,really letting loose several times,which is fitting since this movie was much less restrained than one and two.there are more gadgets,and more flashy vehicles for Batman and later,Robin.i didn't really like the bat mobile in this one.to me it just seemed much too over the top.i don't feel that the character of Batman would actually have a vehicle show showy,even gaudy.but that's just my opinion.Batman changes costumes before the end of the movie,upgrading to something more like a cyborg.his first costume is not too bad,but this second one,although it looks nice,i didn't really see it.i found the colour much too light for the character.i did,however really like Robin's costume a lot.i think it was the great mix of colours.it just seemed right.this Batman movie was more action adventure and also fun to watch.I really liked Bruce's evolution.he really grows as a person. i think it seems natural.Bruce\/Batman is also shown too

That was the only part of the film that didn't speak to me.The central theme as expressed at the end of the film is where Larry tells his old flame Isabel When Piedmont died, I had to pay him back for my life. I found out there's another debt to pay - for the privilege of being alive. I thought Sophie was my reward for trying to live a good life. Uh uh. There is no payoff - not now. I think that is a useful truth regardless if one is religious or not.Bill Murray was great as Larry. Of course there are small bits where his history in comedy come through, although I thought some of those small bits were a bit out of character for this film. One example was when he sends down a basket on a rope to get some bread and tea delivered from the café next to his apartment building. He lets out the rope too fast and you hear it crash into someone who yells out in French. Yes it was humorous but was too much for the tone of the film. Luckily the majority of the film does have some funny bits more in keeping from the situation and dialogue.Catherine Hicks' Isabel Bradley was great too. I have always liked Hicks and think she is a good actress. Theresa Russell steals the show as Sophie MacDonald.

And what a picture filled with pitch-black humor from start to finish, it contains all of Kubrick's favorite themes (loyalty, deception and, ultimately, the uselessness of human life).Based on a book by Lionel White (adapted by the director with some help from noir master Jim Thompson), The Killing revolves, in non-linear fashion (hence Quentin Tarantino's decision to mention White in the closing credits of Reservoir Dogs), around a well-organized, audacious heist which will take place at a race-track. The mastermind behind all this is Johnny Clay (a great Sterling Hayden), an aged criminal who has just been released from prison. By knowing all the right people and making sure they will give him a hand, he is certain the robbery will be absolutely foolproof. But then again he hasn't taken human weakness into account almost all of his associates are planning to get more than the share they have been promised, while one of them has been stupid enough to mention the job to his wife, prompting her and her lover to make plans of their own to run away with all the money.Someone once said Kubrick's movies have never been about people, at least not in a traditional sense what he was interested in was the slow journey that inevitably leads to decay. 2001 A Space Odyssey, Full Metal Jacket and The Shining are good examples of this, and so is The Killing the central heist is pulled off flawlessly, but after that everyone starts making his own decisions, leading to situations that are simultaneously sad and funny (especially the conclusion). In reality, Kubrick only made one funny film in his career, and that's Dr. Strangelove (although that movie is more dark satire than laugh-out-loud comedy), but The Killing's macabre humor contributes to making the atmosphere typically film-noirish, but not too heavily dramatic (even the classic Bogart suspense flicks had lighter, entertaining moments). Alongside the numerous time-shifts (supported by some of the best narration ever heard), it also justifies the film's status as a tame (in terms of on-screen violence and profanity) ancestor of Tarantino's body of work.In short, The Killing is essential Kubrick perfectly crafted script, charismatic protagonist, masterful execution.

But one night he sleeps with Nuria, what he doesn't know is that she seems to love him very much. But on his birthday party he meets Sofia(Cruz), his best friends girlfriend. Nuria is also on his birthday party and sees him leaving the apartment with Sofia, after Pelayo, his best friend, left.The next morning César left Sofia's apartment and wants to drive home when he sees Nuria waiting in front of the apartment. She asks him if she should bring him home. He says yes and that's how he comes into her car. What he didn't know is that she thinks about committing suicide. So they drive along the street and in one moment Nuria drives against a wall. She's dead, César survives but he lost his face. After that event César wears a mask to cover his real face. He comes into a psychiatry because he killed somebody, but César doesn't know what happened. Together with his psychiatrist he tries to remember what happened. And he remembered. One night he slept with Sofia but he hadn't seen Sofia, he saw Nuria so he was that confused that he pulled a cushion on her face so she couldn't breath. But there was something else that he remembered. He remembered that he signed a contract. And this contract is from a company for Life Extension. So he and his psychiatrist drive to this company and talk with the boss and find out that everything that César did was a dream. His body had been frozen 150 years ago and he lived a dream with all the people he loved. To wake up he had to jump from a building. He did and that's how the movie ends.This is a great movie. My second Spanish movie and I like both very much. Alejandro Amenábar is great director. Now the actors. Eduardo Noriega was great. He played fantastic. He had to be funny and in the next moment he had to be terrific and confused. He did a great job. Perfect cast for this role. And then there is Penelope Cruz. I knew that she is a great actress...but now I know that she is brilliant. She is so beautiful in this movie you want to die lol And she did a excellent job too. She played fantastic.
