Max is an underachieving student who nevertheless finds time to participate in some dozen-odd extracurricular activities. His life is turned around when he falls in love with the school's pretty 1st grade teacher and competes for her affections with a millionaire industrialist in a triangle that grows progressively more nasty and uncomfortable to watch. In the three leads, Jason Schwartzman is very fine as Max (it's hard to believe that this was his film debut), as is Olivia Williams as the British love interest and Bill Murray as the increasingly besotted but always likable Herman Blume (another Blume in love!). The film itself--though its story never seems to completely gel and several scenes peter out pointlessly--consistently defies expectations; I will admit that I could never tell where the darn thing was heading next.

(Like another film that prominently featured songs by Cat Stevens, 1971's Harold and Maude, Rushmore seems a likely candidate for eventual cult movie status.)

Seizing a chance for a free trip to the supposed home of a mythical giant ape, paleontologist Jack Prescott (Jeff Bridges) stows away on board, and the expedition is also joined midway by beautiful castaway Dwan (Jessica Lange), who is found drifting in a life-raft after a violent storm sinks the yacht she was travelling on.On arriving at the island, the explorers do indeed discover oil, but also find that the island is inhabited by a savage tribe who worship an ape god named Kong, and they want Dwan to be his bride, whether she agrees to the ceremony or not...Jaws might have been the first ever summer blockbuster, but it was this 1976 remake of King Kong that turned a mere movie into an 'event' I can clearly recall the hype, the build-up, and the excitement that preceded its release, and on seeing the film, I remember being absolutely enthralled. Admittedly, I was only 8 at the time, and any trip to the cinema was an experience, but this was Kong, and as far as I was concerned, he ruled!Unfortunately, critics weren't quite as happy with Guilllerman's version of the great ape adventure as I was the movie was panned, and was even considered a flop despite making bags of cash. On re-watching the film, I now recognise the flaws in the script, the inadequacies of the effects, and the silliness of the dialogue, but overall, I gotta say that I still find this film a lot of fun&#x97;not as much as the '33 original (of course), but certainly more than Peter Jackson's recent bloated, three hour long exercise in excess.Guillerman's direction is solid without being too showy, his cast are likable enough (although Lange's ditzy Marilyn Monroe style performance does irritate at times), the plot modifications are bearable given the contemporary setting, and the beautiful cinematography, by Richard H. Kline, not only delivers some breathtaking shots of the stunning locales, but also makes the most of Rick Baker and Carlo Rambaldi's ape effects. From a distance, Kong does look rather iffy&#x97;clearly a man in a monkey suit&#x97;but the close ups are incredible, with the creature displaying a remarkable range of expressions and emotions; the scene where Kong dries his woman after a waterfall shower is particularly impressive, with the cheeks puffing up and the lips blowing air over an appreciative Lange.As far as excitement is concerned, don't expect too much from the island based action&#x97;the famous tree scene is kinda disappointing, and Kong only gets to wrestle one rather rubbery snake&#x97;but once our massive primate gets to New York, the really good stuff kicks in after Kong has broken free from his cage, he gets to play havoc with the subway, goes for a swim in the Hudson, scales the World Trade Centre, is attacked by flamethrowers, leaps from one tower to another, and trashes a couple of helicopters. Then he shot to pieces and falls to the ground.As time has passed, people have gradually come to accept that this attempt at re-filming King Kong isn't as terrible as it was originally painted to be.

Oh yeah! Well I couldn't be any more wrong. Well Van Damme's acting is robotic, but he still gets to kick butt in human form as he goes after a cyborg woman carrying vital information that could cure the plague that affects civilization in the 21st century. However in his way and holding the cyborg hostage is Fender, the barbarous leader of the 'Flesh Pirates' that roams the vacant cities carving out a hellhole.There's rawness to it, but it's efficiently staged. What I had trouble with was how unexciting and emotionless the film was, despite its comic-book edge and choreographed action being superbly executed&#x85; although director Albert Pyun could've cut down on the over-cooked slow motion. Nonetheless it was good to see Van Damme wipe the floor with those kick-boxing skills, but it did give me a snicker during the sloppy flashback sequences which has Van Damme in an awkward looking blonde wig. However the most pitiful aspect was the over-the-top, try-hard performance of Vincent Klyn as Fender. Boy I could only roll my eyes, especially when he opened his mouth and got into his posing stances. Sadistic&#x85; far from it. Deborah Richter was the opposite, with a lively and feisty turn.The use of junky special effects works out. Being set in a desperate wasteland born from apocalyptic symptoms, Pyun does an exemplary job bringing that out the chosen locations. Some impulsively neat visuals caught by expressive camera-work and rapid pacing go onto add more to a blotchy narration without much of a story in this cheaply produced sci-fi outing.

His ability to act the part of both Tom and Dickie showed his talent as being exceptionally good, despite many of the situations failed to ring true. It was good to see the early work of Cate Blanchett and Jude Law, despite them being fairly minor. I believe the scenery was a winner and made the film a joy photographically. This film is a part of the Patricia Highsmith trilogy on Tom Ripley, and is the far more interesting of the three. ","genre":"Crime, Drama, Thriller"},{"date":"14 August 2009","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" The Thomas Crown Affair (1999) starring Pierce Brosnan and Rene Russo is smoother and more elegant than the 1968 movie, the latter shot it proletarian times which valued dirt under the fingernail people (the proletarian, war on poverty 60's!).McQueen wasn't elegant in the 1968 movie, and places visited in that movie weren't either. The starting scene of the 1968 movie set the tone.....a dumb plastic fantastic no-architecture hotel of the times, sanitary with no style...and fat Jack Weston as the Everyman introducing viewers to the story and it's people.Rich people were doing better in 1999, the Thomas Crown Affair version of that year shows it....Brosnan's version of Crown is smoother, more elegant and polished, almost like a dancer.The museum setting of the two heists in the movie (the NYC public library built by elegant people was used for museum interiors, the lobby, etc. etc.) makes the movie cultural and celebrates the world of cultured rich people far more than the 1968 movie did.All this is nice....the way comedy of manners movies (and stage plays) about rich people in the 1930's and before were nice.....a look at the good life served up in elegant settings, and enjoyed by its participants for good reasons.Brosnan's clothes fit better than McQueen's did. His (Brosnan's) hair cut is better, less deliberate, more understated and elegant than McQueen's.The trip to Martineque in the Caribbean was a good touch (contrast it to the GUYS AND DOLLS 1956 trip to Cuba made by Marlon Brando and Jean Simmons), and the improved glider plane in the 1999 movie was, too (much less clunky plane than McQueen's was in 1968).I could almost taste the smooth, high priced wine served in restaurant scenes Brosnan and Russo shared. Expensive red wine priced at $50\/bottle in liquor stores, double that in NYC restaurants.The 1999 version of Thomas Crown is a travelogue showing the good life in NYC enjoyed by people with time, money, good taste, and all the rest of it.Except for the heavy sex scenes (which aren't believable or attractive), the movie is easy to watch, enjoyable, and smooth....just like an expensive bottle of good red wine, served in a nice place by good people doing the serving and nearby as fellow customers.Dinner Rush (1990) is another 90's movie about rich people in NYC, and their night life (about gangsters in part, but gangsters with elegant haircuts!).Sometimes, the best part of movies is the travel experience they provide, and the plot and even the acting isn't as important.Where were you? is sometimes the question to ask.The Thomas Crown Affair (1999) starring Pierce Brosnan does a good job with that. I enjoyed it.-----------------------------------Written by Tex Allen, SAG Actor.
