Steve is absolutely, stunningly wonderful! And of course, John Goodman is, once again, one of our ten best actors. The most suprising element of this film is how good Jeff Bridges is in this. Why this movie did not get the critical acclamation that Barton Fink and Fargo got, escapes me completely. I truly enjoyed this movie and would highly recommend it. Most poignant for me was the archetypical hypocrisy of the 'can do' right wing doppelganger of 'the dude', which is seemingly self-evident to the general public or it wouldn't have been characterised with such nonchalance. This film brings us back to the mindset and humour of another Coen classic, 'Raising Arizona'. Great stuff.

LORD OF THE RINGS series is my favourite films and therefore thought I'd look into other Viggo movies. I am glad I did this.I looked on IMDB and noticed he was on THE PROPHECY. I have all three of these movies on my shelf and had never watched them before. I like Christopher Walken, but never thought I'd like this film. It didnt look like a horror movie and I didn't really know what to expect. 'What kind of film is it' is still a good question, genre wise anyway. My answer to this question would be simply that it's a great movie.It's not slow on action, but slow on explination. I could not easily begin to explain it right now, but it's easy to understand while you're watching it. I am agnostic and don't like movies that deal with religion, but it is often interesting to see it on film and how different people view it.possible spoilers...This is not your basic good versus evil type of film. It deals with a storyline that is completley original. Neither good nor evil is good nor is either of them evil. Hard to explain what I am saying, but watch the movie and you will understand. God's angels are wicked and Lucifer himself saves the world from damnation.The cast is brilliant I loved all these actors here. Walken was perfect for his role and I could not imagine my king Aragorn as Lucifer but Viggo as Lucifer now is one of my favourite movie characters of all time. It was perfect, when I think of Lucifer, I do think he is wicked evil, but at the same time I dont see him as being this monster people make him out to be. If god and heaven exsists, Lucifer was no different than the next guy, just maybe he didn't like the ways of God. I don't know - there's so many different views of religion in this world. I am not a follower, but peace and love to those who are, faith is a good thing, I like how Lucifer in this movie felt that too, it was positive.9 out of 10 stars. Original, great effects, great acting, scenery, and worth a watch if you like a good film. Still not sure what genre it is, but who cares as long as it entertains - labels suck any damn way!

It scared the hell out of me.  Then, for 15 years, I forgot all about it.  Recently, I found a $5 VHS copy in the discount bin of my local drugstore and thought What the hell?  That was the best $5 I ever spent.Phantasm may not make a lot of sense, the story is confusing and seems to have been made up as it went along, but that's kind of the point.  It's like watching someone else's fever dream...and that's exactly what it's supposed to be like, because it IS someone else's fever dream.  Phantasm is a classic nightmare; totally unpredictable, claustrophobic, paranoid and frightening.13 year old Michael Baldwin was perfect as the young protagonist, an amazingly refreshing, un-annoying child actor.  I was totally convinced by his performance as the lonely teen, desperately chasing after his older brother and displaying just the right amounts of anger, confusion and frustration, yet never giving in to panic even as his world spins out of control.

The creepy atmosphere is unique and very few movies equal to it or even come close. The Thing is some sort of Alien monster that has been safely frozen for the last 100.000 years but now it has thawed. That's the fault of a few Norwegian guys...In the form of a innocent looking dog, the thing ends up in an American Station. This is the greatest power of the enemy. It's fully capable to take over any life form and therefore it's hard to detect. And ... even more importantly ... it doesn't take long before anyone can be trusted. Everyone could in fact be The Thing This rather simple - but at the same time original and innovative - aspect about the enemy allows the story to create a unique claustrophobic atmosphere. First of all, you have the isolated landscape of the Antarctic Circle. The groups ' space to run and hide is very limited since it's unbearably cold and there are lots of storms. Secondly, the Thing to itself is very unpredictable. The tension between the characters can almost be smelled by the viewer and I think that's Carpenter biggest achievement about this movie. Although, there ain't much dialog in this film , you're kept close to the screen in order not to miss anything. Basically, Carpenter does pretty much the same as in his other horror classic Halloween. Although this is a complete different plot and complete different setting, there's not a message to detect, no psychological undertone or no form of humanity what so ever. Just a raw battle to survive between a bunch of tough men.And last but certainly not least ... some credit for the special effects and make-up department. This crew is just brilliant and pretty explicit for the 80's if you ask me. They managed to visualize a perfectly scary looking creature. Several shocking scenes will haunt your head long after you've seen this movie. Don't matter if you're a hardened horror fan already or not, but the images of a splitting dog and a human head marching on spider legs won't leave you senseless. Excellent Class A horror. Also worth a mention the subtle but memorable score by Ennio Morricone... Highly recommend to all film-fans, a must see for horror freaks. The original version from 1951 is highly recommended as well.

Then I finally did rent De Palma's interpretation on King and I did not like it at all. So by definition Carrie 2 would be worse so why bother seeing it? I put off seeing the Rage again. And out of sheer boredom and lack of anything else at the rental store to pick up, I finally went ahead and picked it up. Now I own the Rage, but will never buy the De Palma original. I like this sequel simple because it feels more complete with its character and story arcs. It feels more real with more believable characters, and in fact my biggest gripes lay in the attempts to link Rachel to Carrie with the ever-lame 'coincidentally related somehow but no one knew yet everyone on the audience saw it coming.' Oh yes, and no annoying De Palma split-screen-city, no camera nauseatingly rotating around its subject matter for a seemingly endless period of time, and the 'clever' Bernard Herrmann rip-off motif surrounding telekinesis is mercifully downplayed. In Carrie we had to watch someone completely disconnected from the real world deal with her screwed up mother and her abuse and mistreatment at school. This 'outsider' feel for Carrie was supposed to make us sympathize with her; however, King went too far and started reaching into the fields of lameness with it. I typically like King's writing, but Carrie I could not buy into. The Rage remedies this by making Rachel a part of her generation - she's still an outcast and naïve on many popularity field accounts - but Rachel is still part of her generation. Realistically, who are you more likely to run into? A rejected freak who still is knowledgeable about everyday life and times or someone who might as well have been in a coma her entire life and just woke up? Also the music caught my attention - a surprisingly good score and to my knowledge this is Danny B. Harvey's only feature film score, sadly. It's not revolutionary material, it won't define\/influence horror music for the next twenty years like Goldsmith, Williams, and Herrmann have done, but the Rage's score does its job and does it well.The downsides? The sequel tries to mirror its predecessor in too many categories, especially the ending. The way to go would've been to give nods with minor references for the observant to find, non-plot essential items so that the rage could be its own story and not just an adaptation\/retelling for the original. Jason London's performance annoys me, especially towards the end of the film . . . and how does Rachel go from no control over her power and thinking it all in her head to magically knowing how to use it with marksman precision for the film's inevitable finale? Throw in all your typical package of horror gripes and gaps in logic, and that about sums it up.

Anthony Hopkins did a good job, as did the other suporting actors, and Brad Pitt was great as he always is.  Some people say Brad Pitt is too pretty for this movie.  That just doesn't make since. The story is about how women fall in love with him as soon as they meet him(Suzanna, Isabelle) so it would make since that he is good looking.  The only problem i had with the movie is that it tried to be too much.  I tried to be a romantic movie, an action movie, a drama, and an epic story all in one.  Some movies pull this off well, like Gladiator or Braveheart, but legends tried to be too dramatic with all the people dying and everything.  It is almost as if it could have been an epic story, but tried too hard to be one.  If that makes any sense.     Well, it is a good movie, but it is not a great movie.

It has everything. It has some of the finest action sequences the series has ever thrown up (the pre-credit sequence is to die for), two classic villains in the shape of Reynard and Elektra (they even have Bond baddie names) and what is a surprisingly good little story. Sure it's not Tolstoy or Shakespere, but the plot is very effective and offers up many twists and turns, but as well as that the script is very daring for a 007 movie. First of all the pre-title sequence ends in disaster. The man Bond is trying to save winds up blown to pieces and to further add insult to injury, the usually indestructible secret agent winds up seriously injured ending up with his arm in a cast after the fantastically stylish credit sequence. Even better is that the injury becomes his weakness for the rest of the film and the writers even have him fall in love, a relationship that leads to a denouement more akin to the Dalton era.That's what I love about Brosnan, though. He brings many of the qualities of the previous Bond's to his own he is virtually perfect, not only giving Connery a run for his money, but at times surpassing him. We have the smoothness of Connory, the humor of Moore and the darkness of Brosnan. There's none of George Lazenby, but we should all be thankful for that. Another plus point is that we have more of an ensemble feel for TWINE, which leads to the villains being more than just the usual I must destroy the world stereotypes. Sure Robert Carlyle's Renard may seem like a typical Bond villain (he is unable to register pain due to a bullet in his head), but by playing him as a man in love who welcomes death at the end is a masterstroke and one handled fantastically by director Apted, doing a fine job here. While Denise Richards may not be the best Bond girl acting wise, looks wise she is perfect, with the wet t-shirt moments at the end being a welcome distraction. Kudos too to bringing back Robbie Coltrane. Shame he's killed off as I thought he would make a welcome regular supporting player to the rest of the cast.To sum up, The World Is Not Enough is classic Bond. The Thames chase at the star will be unbeatable and the script is very strong.You could say it left me shaken and stirred.

The basic idea is BRILLIANT (Supergirl gaining her powers on the go) but the execution is lamentable. Where does Supergirl get her costume? How does the space thingy follow the Omegahedron from inner space to outer space? Why does Supergirl decide to join a school when Argo City is dying? Why does she play field hockey? Why, why, why!!! The script is filled with so many assumptions and plot-holes that it was simply impossible to build a solid movie around it. The script also fails to give any sense of urgency to Supergirl's quest. Her quest is a matter of life and death. Instead of looking for the Omegahedron 24\/7, she frolics around here and there while her world might be imploding. The pacing is lackadaisical when it needed to be frantic and urgent. Another problem with the script is that Supergirl doesn't do many super heroic feats. The producers and director were apparently unable to conceive the fact that a female could do heroic stuffs. There are simply not enough heroics going on in the film to be seen as a successful superhero film. As for the combination of magic and sci-fi elements, well, that was actually good  and preceded BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER and other current films and TV shows which have amalgamated both genres successfully.The other thing that drag this movie is the acting. Most of it is terrible. And what makes it worst is the cringe inducing dialogue. It's really bad. You can't really blame the actors for spouting their dialogue with zero conviction. And the special effects are really uneven. One second, they're impressive, the next second they're embarrassing.But as uneven as SUPERGIRL is, the film does have good things going for it. The film's spirit is right-on. It's good-hearted and light and never takes itself too seriously. Helen Slater is PERFECTLY cast as Supergirl. I'd say she's the best movie superhero ever. And some special effects are pretty good (the scene with the mountain is impressive. I still don't know how they did it). But the best thing in SUPERGIRL is the score by Jerry Goldsmith. It's one of my favorite scores ever. It's just amazing. I give the score a perfect 10. Without the score, Supergirl would probably be impossible to watch. It gives character, importance to the otherwise flimsy direction. Another good thing is the use of widescreen. This film has to be seen widescreen. It looks really terrible in pan and scan mode.I'm not a big fan of the whole SUPERMAN series but I have to say that I actually prefer SUPERGIRL over any of the bloated SUPERMAN movies. What's great about SUPERGIRL is that it's an orphaned movie there's only one SUPERGIRL flick and because they didn't make any sequels, the film has a timeless and cultish feel to it which makes it more fun to watch than the SUPERMAN films. Because of the lack of sequels, Helen Slater has, indirectly, become an ageless Supergirl. The Anchor Bay DVD is pretty good. The best version is the International Version. The director's version is even more lackadaisical than the I. V., if you can imagine that. Thankfully, the US theatrical version is not included in the DVD set.

Dear God, what idiot came up with this film's premise?!  I don't know if this was just a bad idea, an attempted `sophisticated' commentary\/symbolism gone horribly wrong, or a really pathetic attempt at making a horror\/comedy and come to think of it, I don't care to find out.  It screams `grasping at straws' and it's bursting at the seams with what made the previous sequels failures in my mind.More ridiculous plotline, more ridiculous and stereotyped characters, more exploration of Freddy's past, parents.  Whoever came up with the law that each Elm Street sequel needs to further explore the roots of Freddy seriously needs to die.  After the first film there really wasn't anything that needed to be explained because if there was Wes would've covered it.In at attempt to be original and sophisticated, 3 starts looking deeper into who Krueger was.  Then Krueger was no longer an enigma and no longer remotely intimidating.  So now in the fifth film we're getting into crap we really don't even want to know about Freddy because 1. every new fact strips away what Freddy used to be 2. most of it is a more explicit regurgitation of something said\/shown in a previous film and 3. being a slasher, the writers will take liberties wherever they please.Good narrative involves knowing what to explicitly explain, what to imply, and what to leave completely open, creating layers of understanding, creating depth.  The original Nightmare did have a degree of depth to it because Wes Craven did not spell out everything in nice big bold letters that any idiot could read.  The Sequels do insultingly spell out everything, they also lack mystery, intrigue, depth, and a reason to see them.  If anything the spoil what Freddy was, and the only thing saving him is Robert Englund staying true to his role, always playing it with flair, and coming back time and time again.    If only the writing was up to par with Englund.There are ways of expanding a story and doing a sequel that does not involve over-exploiting the elements that made its predecessor good.  And let's face it, a sequel that has some item from said person's history (previously unknown) come back to integrate with a new adventure is about as cliché as you can get.Downright stupid kills, and the writer's are determined to kill off the coolness of Freddy.  A very bad sequel . . . ranked below Freddy's Dead solely because at least that film knew it was stupid and comedic.
