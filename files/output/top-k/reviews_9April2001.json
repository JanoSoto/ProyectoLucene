She wasn't so tough that she was unbelievable - she was smart and gutsy but also scared half to death.One thing I really liked about the movie was the complete lack of sexual tension between the main male and female characters.  In most hollywood movies, you have a man and a woman standing in the same room for ten seconds and BINGO - doesn't matter how much older than her the man is, how completely incompatible they are, who is married or anything else - they want each other.  Not so in Along Came a Spider.  Unfortunately, while that made the movie more enjoyable and realistic for me, I have no doubt that the reason for the lack of sexual tension is very clear - it's because Morgan Freeman is a black man.  Guaranteed, had he been a white man, there would have at least been some goo-goo eyes made at some point.  The thirty-plus year age difference probably wouldn't have mattered.  But anyway, despite the racism I suspect was responsible for the choice, I found it refreshing to have no romance entering the story.If you can relax your mind and accept the leaps of logic in the plot, you might find this an interesting movie.

I can't believe I've never heard of this movie before then. It had everything you could hope for in a movie. Excellent story, good acting and great directing by Steven Spielberg. The story is about a young woman named Lou Jean (Goldie Hawn), who has lost custody or her baby son because of her criminal record. She decides the only way she can get him back is to get her husband and take her baby son away from his foster parents. Unfortunately, her husband Clovis (William Atherton) still has four months of his own prison sentence left to serve. Lou Jean visits him at the Pre-release Center he is serving his time in and threatens him with divorce if he doesn't leave with her. He reluctantly agrees and escapes. (Actually he just walks out - the place has the worst security). From then on, the two only have bad luck. The older couple they hitch a ride with get stopped by Highway Patrol Officer Slide (Michael Sacks). Lou Jean and Clovis then steal the older couple's car, wreck the car and kidnap Officer Slide and force him to drive them to Sugarland where their son is living. The remainder of the film chronicles what happens to them on their trip. How the media transforms them into a cause célèbre and how the police have to not only deal with the fugitives but with the media and the public which has rallied behind the couple. The movie also deals with the changing relationship between Clovis, Lou Jean and Office Slide. As Lou Jean, Goldie Hawn brings a heartfelt and sympathetic performance to the role of a women who refuses to see the futility of her actions and is blinded by her desire to get her son back at any cost. This is definitely one of her best performances and shows what she can do with a part that demands a range of emotions. It was a real surprise to see William Atherton as a good guy and not as a pompous jerk or villain. (I will always remember him as the idiot inspector in Ghostbusters). Atherton did a good job of letting you see that Clovis did whatever Lou Jean said not because he was weak-willed but because he really loved Lou Jean and didn't want to lose her. Michael Sacks gave dimension to a character which in lesser hands might have come across as your basic by-the-book cop. Over the course of the movie you see the gradual change in Officer Slide as he is torn between his duty as an officer and his desire to help the couple get their son. (It's a mystery to me why I've never seen Michael Sacks in anything I can remember - he was very impressive in this.)Spielberg's direction gives you a real feel for the expansive Texas countryside which contrasts with the fact that for most of the movie these characters are confined in cars. Spielberg uses everything at his disposal to highlight and backdrop his story - the sunsets, the open Texas highway, and local color are all used to optimum effect. Not a surprise he went on to become as successful as he did.Overall - A must see.

According to the new cow theory, once a bull mates with a cow, it will move on to greener pastures and never look back.  To disprove the theory, they tried altering the cow's look and even its scent, but the bull is wise to the disguise and won't re-mate with an old cow.Our protagonist, Jane Goodall (?), a booking agent for a top Oprah Winfrey-like TV talk show, has similar romantic difficulties with the opposite sex.   On-and-off again in her pursuit of Mr. Right, a handsome, seemingly well-intentioned prospect and co-worker suddenly gets cold feet just when they are about to cohabitate.  Losing her apartment, she is forced to move in with another co-worker, whose bed-hopping habits certainly coincide with her new cow theory.  She wonders if there are any males out there in the dating world who don't hand out the bull anymore.The stars are all terrifically engaging in their roles.  Ashley Judd, taking a breather from all those crime thrillers, is a real natural in this lighter film venue, displaying wonderful camera presence.  Making her scenes count when they need to, her reactive takes are not only bitingly funny but quite often warm and touching.  All this makes her Cinderella alternately amusing and poignant.  Clean-cut, handsome Greg Kinnear by this time has a patent on the Ivy League bull, but still manages way to keep his hollow charmer interesting.  Hugh Jackman plays the streetwise bull with typical macho flair.  Hirsutely handsome, though not quite as hirsute as his Wolverine character in the movie X-Men, he shows definite star power in every frame.  Marisa Tomei is the perfect sardonic confidante who makes the very most of her gritty been there, done that  barbs.  And if you blink, you'll miss Ashley's mom, country superstar Naomi Judd, in a less-than-tiny bit.  Adding a nice, innovative twist to the standard fairy tale story, things fortunately don't wrap up too neatly, but shows definite hope.  The happily ever after bells don't resound as loudly, which gives it a bit more realism.  In fact, there's a telling scene at a New Year's Eve bash when our disconsolate Cinderella leaves the wild party at the stroke of midnight and breaks the heal of her slipper outside the steps of the front door.  One of our Prince Charmings comes trekking out after her, doesn't find her, sits down on the very same steps, and NEVER SEES the broken heel.Despite the surprisingly negative critical reviews on this one, this is a goody.

Icelandic singer Bjork stars as Selma Yeskova, a single mother living in a small town in Washington State, who works in a factory to support herself and her ten-year-old son, Gene (Vladan Kostic).  Selma works her fingers to the bone, taking double shifts and doing whatever she can to save enough money for an operation Gene will need when he turns thirteen to correct an inherited, genetic condition that will eventually rob him of his sight.  And Selma knows only too well the effects of the disorder; even as she works towards accruing the sum needed for the operation, she is coping with the onset of her own imminent blindness.  Besides her son, her one passion in life is movie musicals, which she has loved since she was a little girl; she grew up with them, and now it is to them that she turns in her mind when life closes in on her and threatens to become unbearable.  When she is overwhelmed and overburdened, she hears music in the sounds of the factory and finds rhythm in the work.  In the musicals she finds the respite from concern she needs to carry on, escaping to a place where `nothing dreadful ever happens.'  \tSet in 1964 against a backdrop of the beautiful rural Pacific Northwest, the content of von Trier's film is so real and it is so visually engrossing that at times it's like watching a home video.  And it makes you more than merely an observer of Selma's life; you become involved.  You share the joy of a mother watching her son ride his first bicycle; you sense the `community' of her friends and co-workers who help make her life bearable.  Von Trier successfully manages to avoid any maudlin sentimentality, and instead tells the story in a voice that is straightforward and creates an intense, emotionally complex and memorable film that ultimately takes you to a place that, in the beginning, you would never have dreamed possible.  In a way, it all sneaks up on you, until suddenly you find yourself caught up and swept away in an emotional torrent.\tDiscovering a great film is always exciting (and without question this is one), but when it includes an astounding new talent, as well, it is indeed a thrill.  And such is the case here.  For as Selma, Bjork quite simply gives one of the best performances of the year, and how she got passed over for an Oscar nomination is beyond me.  A gifted individual, she brings subtle nuance to the character, and conveys a humanity of singular depth that makes Selma, and the fact that she is so adamant in her undertaking, more than real and believable.  That the viewer is able to be drawn in and affected on such a personal level with this film is a direct result of Bjork's natural ability as an actress.  Granted, von Trier led the way, and her co-stars (especially David Morse, in a terrific performance as her friend, Bill) provided invaluable support, but the real connection this film makes with audience is through-- and because of-- Bjork.\tThe supporting cast includes Catherine Deneuve (Kathy), Peter Stormare (Jeff), Udo Kier (Dr. Porkorny), Joel Grey (Oldrich Novy), Vincent Paterson (Samuel), Cara Seymour (Linda) and Stellan Skarsgard (Doctor).  Much of the strength of von Trier's film lies in the implied, as well as the overt aspects of it, and in the end, `Dancer In the Dark' will leave you with many things to ponder for some time to come, especially concerning those `gray areas' of the human condition.  Rationale, motivation, the distorted priorities to which it seems so many people are prone, as well as proof of the existence of true goodness that many do, in fact, carry in their hearts.  Emotionally devastating, this is a film that demands reflection.  Unfortunately, it raises many questions to which--just as in real life-- there are simply no real answers.

I'm now ready to go see his work in Traffic.As for Julia Roberts, it was a one-note performance of indignance and the world owes me rhetoric. I got rather tired of her hands on her hips tirades after a while. We all make our own decisions and Brokovich made hers. If I had been her biker boyfriend, I would have said see ya a long time ago. Getting respect from your peers is wonderful but if your kids don't respect you, who cares?I don't deny the fact Roberts is a good actress. But she's done much better in other roles, even Pretty Woman. I felt the same way about Helen Hunt's oscar in As Good As It Gets. Decent acting but worthy of accolades?

This method involves a great deal of trust from a director--a trust in your actors, that they are capable of delivering a truthful performance  through body language; a trust in the audience's intelligence, that they really don't need everything spelled out for them; and a trust in the medium, that it is fully capable of handling an intimate, complex story without using dialogue as a crutch.

I heard a lot of bad things about it, enough to keep me from seeing it in the theater. Maybe what stuck in my mind were a few people saying it had one or two really good FX scenes, and also Kevin Bacon's diary of the filming, which made it sound so grueling and unpleasant that I felt some pity for him and thought I should give it a chance. Big mistake. Big, BIG mistake.Most of the other reviews say it all...but I need to write down how bad this movie is and hopefully purge it from my system. You know, I don't ask for the impossible when I sit down to watch a movie. All I really want from a movie, at minimum, is to be entertained or to escape for 90 minutes or so. The movie started out OK but after the gorilla scene, and the two other invisible transformation scenes, it really went downhill. And got worse.Oh yeah, in case you haven't seen the trailer, or read a review, the plot is a group of scientists is working on an invisibility formula, for the government. The leader of the project is smart, but an arrogant jerk. He meddles with mother nature (another no-no in a scary movie) and deliberately deceives people who trust him (again, another mistake) so the formula can be tested on him as the first human. You'll never guess what happens then things go horribly wrong! People turn to murder!  Disaster strikes!  You waste 2 hours of your time and a rental fee because you should have just watched the trailer, which gave the whole plot away anyway!I had low expectations for this movie-all I wanted was for something to surprise me, or there to be a special effect or shock that made me watch the scene\/moment again a couple times. Or at least want to. For instance, Deep Blue Sea was stupid and mainly lame, but at least had that one big surprise (you know the one I mean-I won't give it away like someone did to me before I saw it). Nope.I didn't find any of the characters likeable.  Sorry, but I don't have too much respect for any character in a horror\/thriller movie that does any of the following 1. walks backward when they know they are in danger 2. turns their back on someone dangerous that they've conked\/injured and strolls away without checking to see if they've really been incapacitated 3. immediately separates when they first realize they are in an isolated area being stalked by someone or 4. says something to the effect of well, I'm glad *that's* over when things obviously aren't-and if you've seen even one other scary movie, everyone knows this is always a precursor to the villain\/monster immediately swooping down on them again or lunging into frame. This movie has ALL of the above-which I could overlook if the movie was at least slightly entertaining (Bruce Campbell in any of the Evil Dead movies usually does all of the above, but makes it fun to watch, to name just one example).Also-and I see by the other reviews that I'm not alone here- I get really insulted when, especially on top of all the other crap, a villain conveniently becomes indestructible in the last half hour or so with no explanation. About every possible debilitating injury happens to him and it doesn't seem to slow him down. All that was missing was him being shot and the bullets bouncing off him.I expected there to be one interesting or memorable concept, especially since (I thought at the time) the movie had such meticulous attention to detail and seemed to take a very high-tech, scientific approach to the story.  The trailers and background info on the making of this film, plus how long it took in post-production, gave me that impression.  The reviews gave it more credit than it had. I was at first slightly interested in the fact that an invisible character couldn't close their eyes, because they had transparent eyelids. I never thought of that! Hmmm, maybe they came up with some other cool twists. That's about as interesting as it gets, and the only new idea they came up with. (then, that got shot all to hell, because about 1 minute later it occurred to me that the person could wear a sleep mask, or go in a completely blacked-out room). A person graphically stripped of all their layers, reminding you (if you're old enough) of the 'visible man' kit you had as a kid? Been done before (though not as well technically as in this movie). A gorilla doing the same thing?  OK, that hasn't been done before, at least not that I know of, but that's maybe 30 seconds that are slightly interesting. Let's face it, you thinking hey, good CGI occasionally is not enough to build a good movie on- in fact, it's pretty sad.I would run out of room if I went into even half of the continuity errors. Just look at the goofs page-I think I've seen one other movie in the IMDB that had a goofs page that long. Now, I'm the type of person who people have to point out continuity errors to before I notice them. Here I noticed ones I didn't even LOOK for. What happened? Did they run out of time?  Money? The studio rushed them?  What's really depressing is someone probably noticed, but they either were too lacy to care or figured the audience would be so impressed with the CGI that their IQs would drop about 50 points and they'd miss it. Not to beat a dead horse, but if the movie had a character that was interesting, or if any scenes surprised me, or entertained me, I could overlook it being stupid and built around some 'ground-breaking' CGI. Yes, I know what a 'popcorn movie\/turn off your brain movie' is, where you just sit back and enjoy the mindless ride. Starship Troopers, Total Recall, Scary Movie- *those* are popcorn movies. It's also not a camp\/so bad it's good type movie. Showgirls, Mommy Dearest, Glen or Glenda- those are ones you can sit and make fun of with your friends. No, instead The Hollow Man is just a waste of everyone's time and money, and that's putting it in way more polite terms than I want to.I would only recommend this if you are a CGI\/FX junkie,if you thought Armageddon and Patch Adams were deep, insightful masterpieces and and you didn't understand why everyone said anything bad about them, or if you really have the hots for Kevin Bacon (though skip the 'becoming invisible' scene, among others, if you don't want to get completely turned off).

It's also not a camp\/so bad it's good type movie. Showgirls, Mommy Dearest, Glen or Glenda- those are ones you can sit and make fun of with your friends. No, instead The Hollow Man is just a waste of everyone's time and money, and that's putting it in way more polite terms than I want to.I would only recommend this if you are a CGI\/FX junkie,if you thought Armageddon and Patch Adams were deep, insightful masterpieces and and you didn't understand why everyone said anything bad about them, or if you really have the hots for Kevin Bacon (though skip the 'becoming invisible' scene, among others, if you don't want to get completely turned off). Interesting premise that goes absolutely nowhere. You have been warned!!

This comedy sendup of the 1970's TV series has a plot as flimsy as Cameron Diaz's outfits, but who cares!  It gives us inane comedy interwoven with serious action, making it wonderfully mindless entertainment.From a technical standpoint, the film is first rate.  First time feature director Joseph McGinty Mitchell (McG) who has won numerous awards for music and commercial videos seems unfazed by this gargantuan project ($92 million budget).  Though the film is done in a hodgepodge of styles (a hallmark of video directors), each is extremely well done, using locations, color and sets imaginatively and effectively.  The pace, like McG himself, is like a frenetic roller coaster ride and the humor generally works.Probably the most impressive elements of the film are the fighting scenes.  Diaz, Barrymore and Liu all trained tirelessly on the wire to produce fabulously athletic fighting scenes that look authentic.  The editing of these scenes is outstanding and when you see them, it seems that Cameron Diaz really can jump eight feet in the air, travel ten yards and kick her foe in the face three times!  There is an excellent behind-the-scenes feature on the DVD that shows how this was done.  This is only one of the many special features on this loaded DVD.  In addition, the DTS sound on the DVD is outstanding and explosive.The acting; well there is not a lot of serious acting going on here.  It is all very tongue in cheek and all three angels handle their roles with an excellent combination of sarcastic humor and sexiness.  Bill Murray is great as the twenty-first century Bosley.  Kelly Lynch is also delectably evil as Vivian rendering some good fight scenes herself.This film is a real crowd pleaser.  I rated it an 8\/10.  It has terrific production values, great action, amusing humor and a killer cast.  With all this, who needs a story?
