An obsessive work of art as only Hitchcock could make 'em. Misunderstood and unappreciated upon its release, VERTIGO is now one of the most celebrated and much talked-about film from the master Alfred Hitchcock. Not even Hitchcock himself could create such an entrancing film as VERTIGO ever again. It's an unqualified success from the man well-regarded as The Master of Suspense. VERTIGO isn't just a great puzzling thriller, it's art. Like a painting by a sophisticated artist, you stare ponderously at VERTIGO and you'll always find something new and intriguing to talk about it. Although criticized for being miscast in the role, James Stewart gives one of his best and darkest performances as John Scottie Ferguson, a former cop who had to quit the force due to his Acrophobia. In a chance of redemption, Scottie is contacted by an old college friend (Tom Helmore) to investigate on the strange behavior of his wife Madeline (Kim Novak). After this set-up, the movie takes a plunge into the deepest and darkest realm of Hitchcock pleasures. A knotty thriller and a romance with a twist, this is Hitchcock at his very best and most satisfying, but you may want to go back and see it again and again just to get the hang of things, but consider that one of the film's many pleasures. In a time where love is considered a powerful feeling, one that conquers all obstacles, Hitch also unveils the darker side of such heavenly feeling; love as a dangerous poison. One might say it's a case of Hitchcock baking his own cake and eating it, but it's more of letting out that skeleton in his closet; unveiling his innermost and deepest obsessions and raising it way up high for everyone to see. As a result, VERTIGO didn't do so well in it's day. But that just proves it This movies way ahead of its own time. Had Hitch gone the wrong way, he might have lightened its tone and gave it a cheesy Hollywood ending. Had it been done that way, VERTIGO couldn't possibly be talked about as much today. After 30 years of absence, VERTIGO was re-released sometime in the 80's (along with other classics as THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH, THE TROUBLE WITH HARRY, ROPE and REAR WINDOW, now dubbed the Five Lost Hitchcocks) with restored footage and sound. On DVD, Hitchcock's classic is better than ever, with first-rate picture quality and sound. You'll swear the movie has not been made THAT long ago. The picture is clear, making the film look like its brand new, and the new soundtrack is breathtaking (Bernard Herrmann's score never sounded so great!). This is a perfect treatment to a one-of-a-kind masterpiece that's bound to entertain and be studied for generations to come. Rating ***** out of 5.

Other than that, they certainly up'd the ante for the technology (even with only a few years in between), the action\/adventure, comedy but all the while kept the great family\/friends feel and morals. To switch things up, Woody now has been toy-napped and it's up to Buzz and peers (still great, never missing a beat from what made them all masterful in #1) to rescue him. I loved the additions to the story such as the Barbie's, Knight's Chicken\/thief, the new Buzz (love the explanation given to what stores did wrong the previous Christmas) and Buzz's nemesis. This was a fun movie to start with and as it progressed, it got a lot better. A lot more fun, adventure, touching and inventive.

Buffy, the largest of the group, died back in 1995 but it is nice for them to carry on the legacy of the group. There was Buffy recorded vocals for a comeback album that was planned during the nineties that never came about - so they those for the upcoming album.ANYWAY I thought of Disorderlies - which I pulled off my friend's DVD shelf to watch. The Fat Boys stole the show in Krush Groove and their lighthearted humor would play out well for a starring feature. They landed Krush Groove director Michael Schultz who had, at that time, directed some classics like Car Wash and Cooley High (not to forget The Last Dragon) and Ralph Bellamy - who is usually known as 'one of the old dudes from Trading Places'.The film was actually a very modest hit - making just a little more than 10 million dollars at the box office. Run-D.M.C.'s film, which came out just a year later, would only gross 3.5 million!!! Off the top of my head I went and looked up what Belly made in theaters - the film that starred Nas, DMX, and Method Man. Over 10 years later that film made just LESS than 10 million dollars. DMX you got PWNED by The Fat Boys Around 1987 was where Schoolly D, Public Enemy, and Ice-T were bringing their early gangster rap that would soon be solidified by N.W.A. The Fat Boys would see Disorderlies as one of their higher points as a group. They made a few more albums, the last one without Markie as he broke out to do a successfully early 90s solo career. And that would be it for the boys - at least moviewise. Sure this film isn't winning any awards but over twenty years later it is still FUN! Of course others have compared this the humor to The Three Stooges and perhaps owing a bit to The Marx Brothers as well. It's a welcomed comparison but the slapstick plays well with the Fat Boys.So I was happy to rewatch the movie and enjoy the hell out of it. If you've never seen the movie or never even heard of the Fat Boys - it is really a treat to watch for the first time.

And that would be it for the boys - at least moviewise. Sure this film isn't winning any awards but over twenty years later it is still FUN! Of course others have compared this the humor to The Three Stooges and perhaps owing a bit to The Marx Brothers as well. It's a welcomed comparison but the slapstick plays well with the Fat Boys.So I was happy to rewatch the movie and enjoy the hell out of it. If you've never seen the movie or never even heard of the Fat Boys - it is really a treat to watch for the first time. The trio were amazing rappers and...while not great actors...made the most of a fun film. It almost makes you forgive Michael Schultz for directing Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. ... Almost.

Run. Hide. Disappear. I am really at a loss for words in many ways to describe just how bad, ridiculous, appalling, and horrible this film is. A group of teenagers are out on prom night when they are redirected on the road down another route only to find a car with a kid hit them, a beautiful Realtor in a cheap office late at night with a neighbor across the street who is never explained, a variety of people going through this place where we are led to believe these terrible atrocities that are about to ensue could happen, and, of course, the house with the crazed killers. Who would these killers be (1)Matthew McConauhey as Vilmer - a crazed psychotic with a powered mechanical leg who takes a knife to his body(shirtless of course)repeatedly, yells maniacally throughout, beats his girlfriend, steps on another girl's face, bites said girls nose almost off, etc... (2)W. E. - Joe Stevens plays the cattle-prodding brother who quotes(and misquotes) the likes of Thoraeu, Macciavelli, and others whilst having virtually nothing else to do except mercilessly poke and prod girls with a cattle prod(who knew prod could be such a versatile word?) (3)Darla - Tonie Perensky as Vilmer's supposedly almost stable girlfriend who is the Realtor and seems to enjoy the high of being with a man with a powered leg, a girlfriend beater, and living in a squalid house where there is no way in hell that she could dress as nice as she does for her job. Perensy is about the only thing I really did enjoy in the film. Not for her performance but for her bust of which we are given a brief but gratifying look at. Other than that she wildly acts hysterically throughout. (4)Grandfather - a truly thankless role as he is in one scene and has nothing to do. ... and, finally, (5) Leatherface - played by Robert Jacks and giving an absurd portrayal of this clownish killer figure. Watch the ending as he wields that chainsaw after the ludicrous Winebago scene. I almost fell out of my recliner laughing at the cinematic ineptitude of that sequence, the lack of directorial competence, and Jacks playing it way - WAY - over the top.

What happens at the end? Who was that guy in the bathroom at the top room upstairs that gives a gun to a girl? How did Vilmer get his legs like that? So many questions and virtually no answers. Yes, I know films like this don't have to have lots of answers but they need something to bridge the gap between imagination and credibility. The bridge here was blown right out of the water. Most of all, the biggest reason this film fails is due to the uninsightful, gratuitous, poorly crafted direction of one-time director Kim Henkel. I really didn't see anything in this film that cried out for his talent. Sure, I have seen a lot worse than this and there are many, many films which are crafted even more poorly.

Today I caught it on Turner Classics along with Isle of the Dead, and it's got to be one of the great unheralded horror films from the 1940's. To say that Boris Karloff's performance was brilliant is an understatement, for me this might be his best characterization ever. Now don't get me wrong, his portrayals of Frankenstein and The Mummy established his iconic status among early horror screen legends, but by their nature, were fairly one dimensional roles. In The Body Snatcher, Karloff is a genuinely menacing and evil character, exuding malice at every turn, especially when turning up the screws on his adversary MacFarlane. Even his name, Cabman Gray, conjures up an image of sheer malevolence, and when he took out Little Robbie during the film's first grave robbery, you had to know that nothing good would come of his presence here.Not that he could carry the picture alone though. Henry Daniell brought his own uncompromising presence to the story in the form of Doctor MacFarlane. As someone who sacrificed his own principles long ago, the good doctor attempts to extend his medical school's advance by drawing young student Fettes (Russell Wade) into the fold. Fettes almost falls into the trap, compromising some of his ethics along the way until he realized he was getting in too deep.It's too bad Bela Lugosi didn't have a larger role in the picture. Along with Karloff, he's one of my favorite horror actors of the era. It's somewhat ironic that his longest scene in the film was where he winds up being murdered by Cabman Gray.You know, I got a kick out of the sign designating the Hobbes House as a destination 'For Gentlemen and The Commonality'. Kind of made it easier for men like MacFarlane to imbibe right along side the local citizenry. Say, keep an eye on that scene in the bar right after it's announced that MacFarlane sold Gray's horse and buggy for a mere four pounds and the new owner is embarrassed into buying him a drink. Right after the barmaid goes to fetch him one, Fettes enters the pub to talk to the Doctor. When the barmaid returns, she has two drinks! Yet she had no indication that MacFarlane was meeting anyone, and the doctor didn't know Fettes was looking for him.Without reservation, if you're a classic horror fan, and even more so, a fan of Boris Karloff, this is a must see movie. Not only is Karloff great, but the story is intelligently written and executed, and the dialog between the principals is always clever and well constructed. Catching this one would only be doing yourself a favor.

Most of the actors made little effort at developing believable accents and spoke in their own accents. I could have lived with this, although some credible accents would have helped.

If you enjoy a good war film that is not just a rally round the flag kind of glorification of war, you will probably enjoy enough to make it worth watching. Just don't expect it to be on your list of all-time greats.

I've never read Lewis, but I had the vague notion that he was an anti-capitalist, and a little internet research seems to confirm this. So I must confess some considerable surprise that, having just finished watching Dodsworth, I was struck by how much it made me think of Ayn Rand.I'm perhaps the only one to see it this way, but I don't think I'm out in left field. ) In many ways, Sam Dodsworth comes across as a Randian hero. A brilliant industrialist, an up-by-his-own-bootstraps self-made-man type, he clearly loved his work and is lost without it. Lacking airs and vanity, he has no interest in his wife's aspirations to the upper ranks of social society, he's more interested in basic, simple pleasures-- the precise sort his wife disdains. Perhaps the quintessential scene is when he exhibits childlike delight in seeing the Bishop's Light, while his wife's only concern is for her mussed hair.He trudges miserably through the film, trying to placate his wife and put up with her shenanigans, ostensibly because he loves her so much. But one senses he loves *the idea* of her more than the actual woman. Again, the actual woman is so obviously wrong for him; his friend Tubby points that out at the very outset of the film.And then when he finally settles in with Edith, what is it that makes him happy again? Aside from finally being with a woman who's right for him, it's being productive again. In the tiny way of setting up a motor on a boat, and in making big future business plans. Extremely Randian.In short, Sam Dodsworth reminded me of Hank Rearden, and his wife reminded me a bit of Hank's wife, Lillian. And while the film doesn't wrestle with the vast philosophical themes of an Atlas Shrugged, the key moral dilemma is also very Randian. And this gets to the core of why I enjoyed the film so much.The key moral dilemma is duty to others versus one's own happiness. At the end Sam must choose between the new life he sees before him with Edith, or going back with Fran. And he chooses Fran, out of a sense of duty, of obligation. And if you're at all like me, you were anguished by that decision. It's not surprising he makes that decision, but it's devastating. By this point in the movie I despised Fran and wanted him to have nothing to do with her. So the movie's final resolution struck just the right triumphant chord with me. In the end, he does finally wise up and choose his own happiness. A very Randian issue, a very Randian resolution. A movie that stresses man's right to live for his own happiness, rather than a duty to live for others, is always going to score big points with me.

Amores Perros is included in the most important movies for the beginning of the 21st century. It marked a new epoch with its thoroughly life-like vision on a twist of fate. Then in a 5 years' of time within more recognized movies, we started seeing similar plot schemes telling different stories over accidents that binds each person's fate. One of them was Crash, and it won the best picture Oscar in 2005.The more you see this film over and over again you'll get to a deeper point where the lives and choices of the characters won't matter any more. It's still affecting in the first-time watch, but with an examining view the next time you see it; you're driven into a vision, a cast of mind.There were 3 main characters and 3 main stories from each one, which are nested altogether. If we look at these stories over the characters' relationships with their dogs, it's intriguing. As if the dogs exemplify their owners 1' Young loafer Octavio commits crime in order to earn money to make a living. He fights his dog Cofi in dog-fighting tournaments. How Cofi needs to fight for his life, so does need Octavio to commit crime for his life.2' In the second story, beautiful model Valeria receives a surprise gift from her fiancé to choose a puppy from a pet store. By time, the puppy gets used to live a super-luxury pet life; which is the same life style of her owner. Valeria and her fiancé's apartment unit is under a hardwood flooring construction. One day while alone at home the puppy falls into a gap between the hardwood and the concrete; thus stays stuck there and began to squawk, since she is not used to live without comfort. At the same day her owner Valeria gets involved in a car accident while driving alone, having no one to help her just as happened to her puppy. She loses her leg in this accident and her luxury life comes to an end, as same as the life of her puppy. She begins complaining like her puppy squawking.3' In the last story, the grim hit-man El Chivo saves the life of Octavio's dog Cofi, after Octavio gets killed in the traffic accident in which Valeria lost her leg. Saving him changes Cofi's life, he no longer needs to fight for Octavio's bets on dog-fighting. His life becomes safe and peaceful. El Chivo starts looking after Cofi beside his other dogs. Among the other dogs Cofi looks very ugly and dirty. One day when El Chivo leaves the dogs together at home, Cofi kills every one of them. His reason of killing all the dogs explains why his owner is a hit-man. As Cofi killed innocent dogs; El Chivo kills innocent people for El Chivo seeing himself ugly,dirty and strange among the people; like his dog feeling himself ugly,dirty and strange among the dogs. El Chivo feels bad about his dogs, when he finds out Cofi has killed them. Yet, he feels worse about himself when he actually realizes that Cofi's attitude gave him a lesson of life. Then El Chivo shaves, cuts his beard and hair, gets cleaned up and turns out looking like a gentleman. Cofi's attitude changes his life; his life becomes safe and peaceful just as when El Chivo saved Cofi's life.The vision we're getting when we compare these 3 stories is about the public loneliness of an individual. The only person, who can guide and who can help us, is ourselves. This loneliness brings our freedom of choices. With making our own choices, we build the essence of our character Our quintessences. Life is sum of all our choices. In order to build our quintessences; we always face the risk, fear and pressure of the chance of making a wrong choice. Life makes it obligatory to make choices. This obligatory builds our inner crisis and develops our personality. To find the secrets of our own personality, we try to find someone or something else to lay a burden on the responsibility of self-search. Here in Amores Perros, the 3 main characters are used by their self-search reflection on their dogs.Doesn't this vision form the idea of Jean Paul Sartre's Being and Nothingness? Since Amores Perros hides the character views through the situations created by dogs; it is a movie that has no characters, but only situations. This is the systematic of Existentialism. If there was no situation or happening, there wouldn't have been any characters. Existence precedes essence. A person is nothing without his actions. So, a person doesn't have a soul(or a character) if he is not alive. Then there wasn't and won't be anything before and after our lives.

Though he has ridiculously been labeled, by some, as the next Pedro Almodovar, Amenábar surpasses Almodovar because he gives his all to a film and always stays true to the story rather than succumbing to meet studio standards. Amenábar is a passionate filmmaker. He really seems to believe in his work. His talents are not limited to directing as he is a successful screenwriter and music director too.'The Others' is his first Hollywood movie and yet there is treated in a non-Hollywood way. In this day and age when special effects like CGI are used in every film, Amenábar goes the old fashioned way and perhaps the only bit of 'contemporary special effects' he uses is the green-screening. In an interview, he once mentioned that the expressions he has drawn from Nicole Kidman's eyes are much better than what any special effects could have done and this is actually quite true.'The Others' is an atmospheric film. The director is clearly influenced by the likes of Kubrick. He succeeds wonderfully in creating a gloomy and chilling atmosphere using lots of subtlety. Lighting plays a key role both metaphorically and literally. Most of the scenes are either set in full daylight or sheer darkness. The noteworthy cinematography brings out the claustrophobia and loneliness and the breathtaking score adds to the spookiness.Often compared to 'The Sixth Sense', 'The Others' goes steps further with its subtle multilayered storytelling. It is much more than just a horror film because there is plenty of psychology and philosophy included in the story. Amenábar has written a solid screenplay with intriguing and thought-provoking dialogue.'The Others' is further blessed with remarkable performances. Fionnula Flanagan is terrific as the suspiciously creepy servant with a hidden agenda. Eric Sykes brings some humour to lighten up the very intense atmosphere. Elaine Cassidy too impresses with a subtle performance. Alakina Mann and James Bentley are awesome as the bratty mean sister and the scared little brother respectively. Christopher Eccleston too is very effective in a small role. However, it goes without saying, that top honour goes to Nicole Kidman. Kidman is sublime. The intensity with which she displays Grace's despair, fragility, anguish and maternal dedication is astonishing. It is a marvelous performance.'The Others' may arguably be the best in 'horror' movies but it will be wrong to classify it in a specific genre because it works on so many levels. It is an absorbing film experience and something that has worked for me even after multiple viewings. I have lost count of how many times I have seen this amazing film.

I disagree. Much like 1977's 'Star Wars' or 'Citizen Kane,' 'Toy Story' was far before it's time and revolutionized it's genre, in this case animation. In addition, they took it to the next level with creativity, a perfect combination of humor for both kids and adults as well as an excellent homage to toys people around my age grew up with. I was at the tail-end to some of the toys shown or in the middle when I was a child. So, of course, a great deal of smiles were on my face throughout in remembrance. But, as a movie-lover\/amateur critic, it has to go beyond that. I won't like a movie without a great and original script\/dialogue, deep characters, good pacing and surprises. This movie has them all. I loved the lines, the voices were pitch perfect, the adventure made up from just from imagination was inventive from minute one and all characters intersected beautifully. Just as child Andy's birthday party is to start, every toy (alive when no one else is around) is worried they'll be replaced and current head-toy cowboy Woody attempts to convince them otherwise. Unfortunately, it is he that's replaced by Space Ranger Buzz Lightyear (love the variances to his name, including Light-beer) who seemingly doesn't know he is anything but an astronaut. Not too far deep into the story is a touching realization\/awakening for both and great learning for the people watching, kids and adults alike. Excellent movie, perfect start for the apparently unbeatable Pixar studios and suitable for all ages. (Side note 2009's 3-D version worth watching, but adds little to the already masterpiece it is.)

In EdTv there was a humble video store clerk guy having his life filmed for a reality show, which was happening in present time. Though in Truman Show very futurist and fantastically, Truman Burbank was not even aware that his life is being filmed, offering the viewer the vision of life from God's perspective. Distinctively here in Pleasantville, there is a journey which starts with materializing a TV-series into life and ends up with materializing the life into this TV-series.The cheerful 1950s' TV sit-com Pleasantville is revived in the '90s on cable. A homebody teen, David Wagner, escapes from the daily rush of the real unpleasant world by watching this show. He doesn't even miss the reruns, memorizes the scripts and speaks them out before the actors in the show say their part.
