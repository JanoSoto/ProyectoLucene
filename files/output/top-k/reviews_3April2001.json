As a sufferer of a present-day equivalent of the mutations shown in this film, I know what my answer is. The modification of the story to show Rogue as a young woman who has only just discovered that everyone she touches is severely wounded by it was a master stroke. Not only was it great to see how human the mutants really are (more so than the normies in this film, as a matter of fact), but casting a delicate, intelligent young woman like Anna Paquin in the role was a perfect capitalisation on the writing. Coupling this with the way Wolverine is shown as the result of a horrid military experiement who is now just trying to survive as best he can was a brilliant idea, too. Hugh Jackman was a perfect choice for the role. As a man whose past combines pieces of these two characters' histories in a more figurative sense, I found these two actors utterly believeable in all respects.The only thing wrong with the movie, in my view, is that the think tank which made these excellent moves with the good guys ran out of steam when the bad guys were written. Mystique, Toad, and Sabretooth just don't have the same level of character development allocated to them as Wolverine, Rogue, Cyclops, and Storm. Mystique gets one line in the whole film (the rest are her pretending to be someone else), and Toad is merely there to provide excuses for gratuitous special effects shots. Capping that off is the fact that Magneto is shown as a survivor of the holocaust who takes on the same kind of attitude as the Nazis. Granted, he is being somewhat provoked by the section of humanity that is afraid of mutants, but once again my experience as part of a small percentile of the populace that has had outright lies told about it by the rest tells me that more motivation would have been required for Magneto to become so like his real enemy.Aside from the uneven development of the characters, however, this is another near-great modern adaptation of a comic book.

The rest of the film is just pointless filler getting us to the somewhat enjoyable ending, well about one fourth of it was enjoyable anyway (the saber duel). In the meantime you have a pointless race where you just knew young Anakin was going to win, stupid cameos that make no sense (come on, Anakin making C-3PO, really?), and very bland leads in Liam Neeson as a guy who never existed in the original saga and Ewan as a even more impressively bland Kenobi.

However, I also found it extremely trite and shallow. This movie wants to be Goodfellas or even Casino (an unfairly maligned film) and will inevitably be compared with those films. But, it falls well short and comes across like Scorsese-lite, at best, and, at worst, as reductive and predictable as a TV movie. Blow's timing is especially unfortunate since we just got a trenchant, comprehensive view of the drug world from Traffic - and Blow pales in comparison.The first and perhaps most fatal flaw is how broad the strokes that the screenwriters David McKenna & Nick Cassavetes and director Ted Demme make - they tend to settle for boiler plate scenes. The film depicts the rise and fall of a drug dealer - and you could probably plot out every scene right now without even seeing the film. Here's the scene where he meets his first beautiful girlfriend. Here's the scene where they make their first score. Here's where they get high & live it up. Here's where they get busted. Etc.,etc., etc. Characters pop in and out and things happen without much explanation or development. I never really felt like I got to know any one or emotionally attach myself. Perhaps, this is a result of choppy editing -but I felt that the script and direction tended to go for the obvious or the obviously gritty. The cast consists of some of the most interesting actors from around the world (including Max Perlich and Run Lola Run's Franka Potente - wasted in a throwaway role) but the movie doesn't give them much to do or bother to dig deeper into their psyches. Paul Reubens aka Pee-Wee Herman manages to give a winking, fey performance as a hairdresser cum drug dealer, but he's one of the few actors that actually registers a presence aside from Depp. Both Rachel Griffiths and Penelope Cruz are wasted in caricatures (The women in the film consist mostly of strident caricatures - screaming harridans and crazy, coked out bitches). While Depp is always magnetic to watch and does a remarkable job with the physical transformation of his character through time (though his Boston accent is erratic and he has a tendency to appear too much like a rock star in his recent roles - remember Chocolat? - I'm still trying to forget), his characterization ultimately disappoints by remaining remote. George Jung remains a cipher for us. I wish he'd return to the maturity and subtle depth of his performance in Donnie Brasco (which remains his best and perhaps most adult performance - free of gimmicks and quirks). We get crude attempts to draw lines between Jung's early family life and his later domestic life with his wife and child. My next complaint is that I didn't learn a damn thing from this movie. I was hoping to gain insight into the details of cocaine production, distribution & sales, or find out about what made George Jung or Pablo Escobar tick. We only get a rough sketch of Escobar (etched with sly, savage economy by the great Kiwi actor Cliff Curtis - when will someone give him a movie of his own?) from a distance & Jung remains a remote albeit charming blank. We never meet the customers, the users of cocaine, we don't even really see deals being made in any great detail. We don't see anything we haven't seen before and I walked away unenlightened and unedified. Last, there's the matter of style. The movie suffers a lack of tonal consistency (Is it a realistic docu-drama? Subjective first-person account? A blend of the two? Campy social satire? Tragedy?) and worse, from a lack of a coherent style. Goodfellas was always filtered through Henry Hill's eyes - and went even further by being filtered through Scorsese's view of Hill and his world - giving it an extra subtle layer irony to the amoral proceedings.Demme and his DP Ellen Kuras change stock, exposure, camera angles & employ freeze-frames and stylish lighting flourishes with reckless abandon. I'm all for stylistic adventurousness and experimentation. But there has to be a moral or aesthetic justification for each flourish- otherwise it becomes arbitrary MTV gobbledy-gook. When Scorsese uses these tricks, they're used with tremendous skill and precision. Each effect is designed to underline a specific character, emotion, piece of information, or theme. Or perhaps, he wants the audience to share the emotions of his character at that particular moment. Demme's style is more wily-nily.I learned far more about the rise and fall of a sinner & criminal pathology from Goodfellas. Soderbergh's Traffic gave me more insight into the international world of drug trafficking & moved with more with the intractable complexity of Benicio Del Toro's character. Blow just passed the time somewhat uneasily. It bums me out to dislike this film since I was gunning for it & we really need a great film to watch. But this isn't it.

I wish he'd return to the maturity and subtle depth of his performance in Donnie Brasco (which remains his best and perhaps most adult performance - free of gimmicks and quirks). We get crude attempts to draw lines between Jung's early family life and his later domestic life with his wife and child. My next complaint is that I didn't learn a damn thing from this movie. I was hoping to gain insight into the details of cocaine production, distribution & sales, or find out about what made George Jung or Pablo Escobar tick. We only get a rough sketch of Escobar (etched with sly, savage economy by the great Kiwi actor Cliff Curtis - when will someone give him a movie of his own?) from a distance & Jung remains a remote albeit charming blank. We never meet the customers, the users of cocaine, we don't even really see deals being made in any great detail. We don't see anything we haven't seen before and I walked away unenlightened and unedified. Last, there's the matter of style. The movie suffers a lack of tonal consistency (Is it a realistic docu-drama? Subjective first-person account? A blend of the two? Campy social satire? Tragedy?) and worse, from a lack of a coherent style. Goodfellas was always filtered through Henry Hill's eyes - and went even further by being filtered through Scorsese's view of Hill and his world - giving it an extra subtle layer irony to the amoral proceedings.Demme and his DP Ellen Kuras change stock, exposure, camera angles & employ freeze-frames and stylish lighting flourishes with reckless abandon. I'm all for stylistic adventurousness and experimentation. But there has to be a moral or aesthetic justification for each flourish- otherwise it becomes arbitrary MTV gobbledy-gook. When Scorsese uses these tricks, they're used with tremendous skill and precision. Each effect is designed to underline a specific character, emotion, piece of information, or theme. Or perhaps, he wants the audience to share the emotions of his character at that particular moment. Demme's style is more wily-nily.I learned far more about the rise and fall of a sinner & criminal pathology from Goodfellas. Soderbergh's Traffic gave me more insight into the international world of drug trafficking & moved with more with the intractable complexity of Benicio Del Toro's character.

However, I also found it extremely trite and shallow. This movie wants to be Goodfellas or even Casino (an unfairly maligned film) and will inevitably be compared with those films. But, it falls well short and comes across like Scorsese-lite, at best, and, at worst, as reductive and predictable as a TV movie. Blow's timing is especially unfortunate since we just got a trenchant, comprehensive view of the drug world from Traffic - and Blow pales in comparison.The first and perhaps most fatal flaw is how broad the strokes that the screenwriters David McKenna & Nick Cassavetes and director Ted Demme make - they tend to settle for boiler plate scenes. The film depicts the rise and fall of a drug dealer - and you could probably plot out every scene right now without even seeing the film. Here's the scene where he meets his first beautiful girlfriend. Here's the scene where they make their first score. Here's where they get high & live it up. Here's where they get busted. Etc.,etc., etc. Characters pop in and out and things happen without much explanation or development. I never really felt like I got to know any one or emotionally attach myself. Perhaps, this is a result of choppy editing -but I felt that the script and direction tended to go for the obvious or the obviously gritty. The cast consists of some of the most interesting actors from around the world (including Max Perlich and Run Lola Run's Franka Potente - wasted in a throwaway role) but the movie doesn't give them much to do or bother to dig deeper into their psyches. Paul Reubens aka Pee-Wee Herman manages to give a winking, fey performance as a hairdresser cum drug dealer, but he's one of the few actors that actually registers a presence aside from Depp. Both Rachel Griffiths and Penelope Cruz are wasted in caricatures (The women in the film consist mostly of strident caricatures - screaming harridans and crazy, coked out bitches). While Depp is always magnetic to watch and does a remarkable job with the physical transformation of his character through time (though his Boston accent is erratic and he has a tendency to appear too much like a rock star in his recent roles - remember Chocolat? - I'm still trying to forget), his characterization ultimately disappoints by remaining remote.

And if that minute and a half comes early in life, how far into adulthood can you carry it with you, and when does a healthy memory become an obsession that finally blurs the line between reality and fantasy?  `The Fan,' directed by Tony Scott and starring Robert De Niro and Wesley Snipes, is an intense and disturbing motion picture that examines that moment and the effects it can have on the lives of those either directly or indirectly involved.  Here, the focus is on one Gil Renard (De Niro), a knife salesman in San Francisco and a die-hard Giants fan who is pumped about the acquisition during the off-season of superstar centerfielder Bobby Rayburn (Snipes), whom he believes will bring a pennant to the team.  Once a player himself-- a pitcher-- Renard's life has since been on a downhill slide.  Divorced, he has a young, little league aged son, Richie (Andrew J. Ferchland), with whom he has an unsettling relationship, and at work, his sales have been so poor his job is on the line.  An angry, disturbed individual, Renard has reached a pivotal point in his life; for inspiration, he continually returns to the philosophies of the catcher from his playing days, Coop (Charles Hallahan), whom he considers one of the finest athletes he ever knew.  And as his life continues to deteriorate, his obsessions begin to add further to the imbalance of his perceptions of reality, which finally lead him past a point of no return.\tScott's film, of course, has less to do with baseball than it does with how the game itself actually relates to life and the things that really matter.  As Rayburn says at one point, `We're not curing cancer here.'  But to those to whom life has been reduced to that minute and a half to which they still cling, the game can be everything.  And it is just that unhealthy obsession that Scott examines in this film, that comparatively insignificant moment that in the obsessive mind becomes an episode of monumental importance that finally distorts any semblance of reality the individual may have left.  What's truly frightening is that upon close scrutiny, in Renard there is much with which many viewers will be able to relate in one way or another  The anger, the frustration and perhaps the inability to let go of that minute and a half, even when it threatens to become more than just a pleasant memory, but an unhealthy lifeline to another place and another time that, in reality, may never have existed in the first place.  It's like a search for self-esteem by the has-been-who-never-was, who can neither realize nor accept it's elusiveness.  As Renard says to Richie, `Baseball is better than life, because it's fair.  You hit a sacrifice fly and it doesn't count against your average.'  An ideal that has forever eluded Renard; in his life, he's never been able to `give himself up for the team' and get anything in return for it.\tAs Renard, De Niro gives an explosive performance that at first glance may seem to have a bit of Travis Bickle and Max Cady in it-- which in fact it does-- though upon closer inspection, Renard is a unique character.  Those with a disturbed mind may have traits in common, as these characters De Niro has portrayed certainly do; but De Niro has successfully given each of them an individual personality, and when viewed side by side, the differences are readily apparent.  Bickle may be a sociopath, Cady a cold blooded killer; but Renard is a man who was just never able to get a handle on his life and has allowed his obsessions to dictate the choices he has made along the way.  De Niro is simply a master of his craft, with the ability to make his characters so real that a performance like this one is often overlooked; this is Oscar worthy work for which he never received the acclaim he was due.  His Renard is so like someone you would run into in your everyday life that in retrospect, it's scary.  But it's the kind of performance we've come to expect from De Niro, and as usual, he does not disappoint.\tWesley Snipes, as well, gives a solid performance as Rayburn that is one of his best ever, which is not surprising when you consider with whom he was working.  If you study De Niro's films, you may discover a common thread running through them with regard to his co-stars.  De Niro has the ability to make those with whom he is working better; and it's something that stays with them forever after.  Consider Christopher Walken and Meryl Streep before `The Deer Hunter,' or Ed Harris before `Jacknife.'  Certainly they were exceptional talents before, but they have arguably been better since.  And Snipes is no exception.  Nor is Benicio Del Toro (Recipient of the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for `Traffic'), who gives a memorable turn here as Rayburn's rival outfielder, Juan Primo.  \tThe supporting cast includes Patti D'Arbanville (Ellen),Ellen Barkin (Jewel), John Leguizamo (Manny), Chris Mulkey (Tim), Dan Butler (Garrity) and Brandon Hammond (Sean).  A thought provoking thriller that gives some real insight into the cause and effect of the psyche of human nature, `The Fan' is like an open wound that may hit too close to home for some.  And to dismiss this as just a `baseball' movie or another `action' flick would be a mistake, for there is much more here than meets the eye.
