But director Betty Thomas decided to be somewhat naive, giving us a PG-13 version of what should have been a much darker film.  Nevertheless, it does give us some insight, and does have some moments of truth.  And Bullock's credible performance as an alcoholic helps hold it together.  I admire Bullock a lot as an actress--she is very charming and very beautiful and very talented--but she does tend to play a lot of the same roles.  She's never tackled a real character role, but what can you expect out of someone who has mostly romantic comedies under her belt.  This is pretty much the most unusual role for her.  Though she is still playing the sweet, charming Sandra we've grown to love, she also makes the abusively alcoholic side of her personality well-known.  Hell, not all alcoholics are depressed, suicidal jerks (as Hollywood tends to melodramatically express to us).  Her character is a happy, free-spirited party animal--aren't we all?--but she never knows when to quit.  And the you-know-what hits the fan when she ruins her sister's wedding and gets into a car accident. The supporting cast is good as well, with such talents as Marianne Jean-Baptiste, Elizabeth Perkins, Viggo Mortensen, Alan Tudyk, Reni Santoni, Mike O'Malley (hopefully, his movie career will fare better than his TV career, b\/c he has good potential) and Azura Skye, who plays a role much more complex than her shallow role on the short-lived WB series Zoe, Duncan, Jack and Jane.  And I forgot to mention Steve Buscemi as a former drug\/alcohol abuser, who is now a counselor.  A much more mild-mannered, subdued role for him.  I have to admit, I enjoyed him more as the motormouth in Fargo and Reservoir Dogs, but it's always nice to see actors do something different. Bullock's character arc is believable, and I do feel convinced when she comes to the big realization that her life is a total disaster b\/c of alcohol.  But by the third act, Betty Thomas tries too hard to create a series of happy endings and have the audience go Awwww.  The sentimentality goes way too far, and it just feels forced.  I guess she didn't want the film to get too dark, and basically she wanted to be able to market it as a comedy.  But you can't make a movie about addiction and expect to end on a fine-and-dandy note.  You have to be dark.  You have to sacrifice the comic relief.  I enjoyed the humor, in some cases I was on the floor laughing, but in some cases it just seemed unnecessary. 28 Days is a fun, entertaining, well-acted film that's worth recommending, unless you're in the mood for a serious film about addiction (watch Permanent Midnight or Basketball Diaries).  But the one thing I have to admire is the movie isn't preachy about its message--that's the key.  The film never wanders into Just Say No territory.My score  7 (out of 10)        ","genre":null},{"date":"29 January 2002","score":"","review":"  This movie could've been a lot more powerful, and could've given us much deeper insight into the subject of alcohol and drug abuse.

In fact, this movie is full of one liners such as this and can be bagged for doing so. But why dwell on the bad things in a movie full of fun and mischief.In Batman Forever, the Caped Crusader battles a devious duo in Two-Face and The Riddler, while attempting to resist the advances of sexy psychologist, Chase Meridian. Former circus acrobat Dick Grayson, his family killed by Two-Face, becomes Wayne's ward and Batman's new partner, Robin the Boy Wonder.Again the baddies in this film make a huge impact on the audience. They did on me. Jim Carrey was brilliant as the crazy prankster, The Riddler. His wit and true genius came through in this role. This role was not unlike the role he portrayed in the 1994 smash, The Mask. I loved that film. Considering this film was made one year after the Mask, Carrey steps out of one movie and into another no trouble at all. The films that Carrey has done later on in his career have made more people in the movie industry stand up and take notice. Man On The Moon and The Truman Show showed us the true talent of Carrey. But other people might have the opinion that Carrey was over the top in his role of the Riddler in Batman 3. Like Jack Nicholson as the Joker in Batman, Carrey steals the show. So who is the main character in the Batman films? Batman? I don't believe so!The other baddie in  Batman Forever is Tommy Lee Jones. Jones took on the role of the scarred and evil Two-Face, aka Harvey Dent. Jones portrayed this character very well. The start of the film was pretty good, with Two-Face causing havoc in Gotham. I say this role could have been better if the audience could have seen more into what happened to Dent as the Gotham District Attorney and how he turned into the evil man he was. Jones has done some impressive films in his time. Films like Men In Black, Us Marshals and Volcano were all favourites of mine, thanks mainly to Tommy Lee Jones. One of his latest films which I did enjoy was Rules Of Engagement, a terrific courtroom drama movie co-starring Samuel L. Jackson.Taking on the role of Batman in third film was Val Kilmer. I have nothing against Kilmer as I feel he is a good actor, but he is not as good as Michael Keaton. Then again it would be a hard role to find the correct actor for. Every time I  watch this film, I hope to find Keaton jump onto the screen as the Dark Knight. But Batman's partner Robin, played by Chris O'Donnell, was casted perfectly in this role. After watching the first Batman movie, I heard that the role of Robin could be going to Michael J. Fox. As good as Fox would have been, I'm glad O'Donnell was given the chance to do this role. The Aussie taste in this film was good to see. Of course I am talking about Australian actress, Nicole Kidman, who was Dr Chase Meridian. I loved the relationship that the beautiful doctor first has with Bruce Wayne, then with Batman. I want to say that I feel sorry for Kidman and former Husband Tom Cruise. The pressure that must be placed on a relationship in this kind of industry must be harsh. I hope that everything works out in the end for both parties.This film was directed not by Tim Burton, but Joel Schumacher this time around. As spectacular as this film looks, I believe Burton gave us a better feel to what Batman should be. Dark and Gothic. Yet, Schumacher made this film too light and colourful. Gotham City was nowhere near what it was meant to look like in my view. Schumacher turned the Dark Knight into what I would say is the 'Bright Knight!'. Schumacher overall did a good job, but he didn't capture what Batman is all about.One part of this film which I did enjoy was the soundtrack. With performers such as Seal, U2 and The Offspring making quite a CD. My favourite song on it would have to be Seal's 'Kiss from a rose'. The vehicles in this film were very impressive. The new Batmobile (which I have seen up close) was magnificent. Also the Batwing, Batboat and Batsub all look good in this film. The Batcave was ok, but has nothing on the caves in the first two films. I must say that the storyline with the Riddler blowing up the Batcave was alright.I was on holidays in 1995 when I got to see Batman Forever in the Cinema. My first impressions of this film were that it was well done. One day on this holiday, I happened to be on a bus and the driver said he had watched this film and pointed out a fact which I never considered, that Batman never kills any of his enemies. This film is a prime example of that. I don't know which way to go on Batman Three. The storyline is at times very corny, yet it also has some excellent fighting and robbery scenes, with the brilliant Carrey stealing the limelight. But the Batman franchise was starting to get thin by 1995.

I loved the relationship that the beautiful doctor first has with Bruce Wayne, then with Batman. I want to say that I feel sorry for Kidman and former Husband Tom Cruise. The pressure that must be placed on a relationship in this kind of industry must be harsh. I hope that everything works out in the end for both parties.This film was directed not by Tim Burton, but Joel Schumacher this time around. As spectacular as this film looks, I believe Burton gave us a better feel to what Batman should be. Dark and Gothic. Yet, Schumacher made this film too light and colourful. Gotham City was nowhere near what it was meant to look like in my view. Schumacher turned the Dark Knight into what I would say is the 'Bright Knight!'. Schumacher overall did a good job, but he didn't capture what Batman is all about.One part of this film which I did enjoy was the soundtrack. With performers such as Seal, U2 and The Offspring making quite a CD. My favourite song on it would have to be Seal's 'Kiss from a rose'. The vehicles in this film were very impressive. The new Batmobile (which I have seen up close) was magnificent. Also the Batwing, Batboat and Batsub all look good in this film. The Batcave was ok, but has nothing on the caves in the first two films. I must say that the storyline with the Riddler blowing up the Batcave was alright.I was on holidays in 1995 when I got to see Batman Forever in the Cinema. My first impressions of this film were that it was well done. One day on this holiday, I happened to be on a bus and the driver said he had watched this film and pointed out a fact which I never considered, that Batman never kills any of his enemies. This film is a prime example of that. I don't know which way to go on Batman Three. The storyline is at times very corny, yet it also has some excellent fighting and robbery scenes, with the brilliant Carrey stealing the limelight. But the Batman franchise was starting to get thin by 1995.

","genre":"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"},{"date":"29 January 2002","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":"  The most famous line from this Batman movie in my opinion would have to be when the Riddler says `Riddle me this, riddle me that, who is afraid of the big black bat?' In fact, this movie is full of one liners such as this and can be bagged for doing so. But why dwell on the bad things in a movie full of fun and mischief.In Batman Forever, the Caped Crusader battles a devious duo in Two-Face and The Riddler, while attempting to resist the advances of sexy psychologist, Chase Meridian. Former circus acrobat Dick Grayson, his family killed by Two-Face, becomes Wayne's ward and Batman's new partner, Robin the Boy Wonder.Again the baddies in this film make a huge impact on the audience. They did on me. Jim Carrey was brilliant as the crazy prankster, The Riddler. His wit and true genius came through in this role. This role was not unlike the role he portrayed in the 1994 smash, The Mask. I loved that film. Considering this film was made one year after the Mask, Carrey steps out of one movie and into another no trouble at all. The films that Carrey has done later on in his career have made more people in the movie industry stand up and take notice. Man On The Moon and The Truman Show showed us the true talent of Carrey. But other people might have the opinion that Carrey was over the top in his role of the Riddler in Batman 3. Like Jack Nicholson as the Joker in Batman, Carrey steals the show. So who is the main character in the Batman films? Batman? I don't believe so!The other baddie in  Batman Forever is Tommy Lee Jones. Jones took on the role of the scarred and evil Two-Face, aka Harvey Dent. Jones portrayed this character very well. The start of the film was pretty good, with Two-Face causing havoc in Gotham. I say this role could have been better if the audience could have seen more into what happened to Dent as the Gotham District Attorney and how he turned into the evil man he was. Jones has done some impressive films in his time. Films like Men In Black, Us Marshals and Volcano were all favourites of mine, thanks mainly to Tommy Lee Jones. One of his latest films which I did enjoy was Rules Of Engagement, a terrific courtroom drama movie co-starring Samuel L. Jackson.Taking on the role of Batman in third film was Val Kilmer. I have nothing against Kilmer as I feel he is a good actor, but he is not as good as Michael Keaton. Then again it would be a hard role to find the correct actor for. Every time I  watch this film, I hope to find Keaton jump onto the screen as the Dark Knight. But Batman's partner Robin, played by Chris O'Donnell, was casted perfectly in this role.

Sometimes the whole world will hear that cry, but often it will fall on deaf ears.  `The Man Who Cried,' written and directed by Sally Potter, is just such a story, of a people-- Jews-- unimaginably persecuted and attempting to find their voice, that common expression of their suffering and turmoil.  And, as is wont to happen in extreme situations, that expression will manifest itself in terms that are universal and defy the barriers of language.  The `Man' in this story can be found in hu-MAN-ity, and his cry can be found in the common expression of song  In the aria of the opera, in the songs of the gypsies camping on the outskirts of Paris, or in the a capella intonations of a young Russia girl, a Jew, exiled from her home and adrift, alone, in a world of incomprehensible confusion.\tThe story begins in Russia, 1927; a man (Oleg Yankovsky) is forced to flee the country for America, leaving behind his young daughter, for whom he hopes to send later, once he is settled.  Very soon, however, the preadolescent girl is forced to leave, as well, and winds up alone in England, at a school, where she is given the name `Suzie,' and, being an outsider, suffers the taunts of her peers.  And through it all, what keeps Suzie (Christina Ricci) going, is the thought that some day she will be able to join her father (from whom she has not heard since his departure from Russia) in America.  In the meantime, Suzie finds solace in singing, while her personal odyssey eventually takes her to Paris (at a most inopportune time for a Jew), where she becomes involved with a dancer named Lola (Cate Blanchett), a renowned opera singer, Dante Dominio (John Turturro) and an enigmatic gypsy, Cesar (Johnny Depp).  Now a young woman, Suzie's dreams of America have diminished somewhat, but as the Nazi war machine begins cutting a swath across Europe, her thoughts, with renewed fervor, yet mingled with doubt, turn again to the possibility of joining her father in America.\tAs with her previous effort, `Orlando,' in 1993, Sally Potter had a definite vision of how to approach and present her story.  Unfortunately, she seems unable-- or unwilling-- to share that vision with her audience.  The story itself is interesting, if not original, but her disjointed, abstract methods of presenting it make it too obscure to embrace.  On the surface, what some may initially consider an imaginative rendering of the material dissolves under closer scrutiny, and the artistic, abstract presentation is revealed as nothing more nor less than the effects of awkward transitions that defeat the very vision Potter was attempting with this film.  The `transitions,' in fact, which are so vital to the telling of the story, are actually not so much transitions as they are lurches or jumps, which dramatically distorts the flow of the film.  Add to that the lack of character development or delineation, as well as Potter's inability to maintain any tension whatsoever, and the result is a film that is emotionally uninvolving and, at best, unapproachable from the standpoint of the audience.  Visually, it has it's moments, especially in the silent exchanges between Suzie and Cesar, but they are simply too few and far between to sustain any interest.  And it's unfortunate, because Potter had all the tools with which to work, but didn't know what to do with them.\tThe performances, too, suffer the same fate as the presentation of the film.  Ricci looks stunning-- very reminiscent of a young Elizabeth Taylor, in fact-- and her performance is the highlight of the film; Suzie, at least, is believable.  Ricci does well with the material she is given-- which isn't much-- and her lack of dialogue and extended moments of silence may mask, somewhat, the ambiguity of the character.  She is wonderfully expressive, however, which at least adds a touch of mystery to Suzie, who because of Potter's lack of attention is not nearly as sympathetic a character as she should be.  Ricci has developed a powerful screen presence, quite apparent though unemployed in this film, and hopefully in her next project she will have a director who knows how to use it.\tLike Ricci, Cate Blanchett does the best she can with the material, but under Potter's unsteady hand Lola seems out of step with her environment, and despite Blanchett's best efforts comes across as more caricature than character.  She certainly tried, however, and attempted to get more out of Lola than was humanly possible.  A poorly written stereotype, there was nothing Blanchett could do to save herself, or the character, with this one.  \tJohn Turturro suffers the same fate, only more so.  Without the necessary guidance, he seems to have a hard time immersing himself into Dante's skin.  It's a good effort, but Turturro as Dante is like putting a square peg in a round hole; he just doesn't fit.  And the singing voice provided for him defies credibility.  \tDepp, as well, seems at odds with his character, Cesar, though he suits the part of the silent, brooding gypsy quite well.  Again, it's a case of being all dressed up with nowhere to go.  The character was not so much poorly written as too ambiguous; to be effective (as he could and should have been), Cesar simply needed some direction, and it was not there.\tThe supporting cast includes Harry Dean Stanton (Perlman), Hana Maria Pravda (Grandmother) and Claudia Lander-Duke as young Suzie (the best bit of casting in the film; very credible as a young Ricci).  The most positive thing that can be said of `The Man Who Cried' is that it had such potential.  Alas, it was never tapped; and you're left with the thought of what could have been.

This movie was downright awful!!!!!  It's like they had in one hand good choices and in the other hand bad choices, like a taste test, and they always picked bad choices.  I'm convinced that this movie was a joke to all who participated in it.  I mean, did the cast READ the script????!!!!  What were there salaries again????!!!  Must have been a lot to make such great actors seem so less-than.First off, the cinematography - what cinematography???  How the heck do you light a movie so badly.  I saw so many chances to make things look, I don't know...SCARY or great or at least interesting that were just passed up with overlighting from unidentified and unmotivated sources that frankly didn't make any sense whatsoever.

David Lynch has well and truly excelled himself with Mullholland Dr., a haunting, mind-bending, poetic masterpiece that is, dare I say it, better than Blue Velvet (which, until I saw this, was my all-time favourite film).While still very Lynch in its attitude and character, it shows him maturing and exploring facets of human emotion that his previous films have only explored superficially. Mullholland Dr. sees him move into the rarest of cinematic fields, along with Bergman and Kubrick, in the way that he adresses and looks at the human condition, psychology and the question of identity. I've only seen this film once, but my head is still spinning from doing so; every so often, images or scenes from the film, particularly the Caberet Silenzio sequence, repeat in my mind and make me want to rush off and see the film again.

So naturally when I found out that the myth was to find its way to the silver screen, I could hardly wait to purchase my ticket.  After viewing the movie, however, I can't help but be a bit disappointed. Director Mark Pellington did comment that he did not want to make a monster movie, but rather a psychologically terrifying story.  The problem I had with the film is that knowing that the story is not about the mothman as an entity, but rather the prophecies it tells, diluted its energy.Cut this film down to say an hour and it would play better.  Two hours and it becomes a drawn-out exercise in realizing a specific prophecy, which by the way is no secret.  The trailers gave it away. So how can the tension sustain itself? I got tired of watching Richard Gere confounded by the endless barrage of haunting events.  They seemed to repeat themselves over and over.  And the answers to all this mystery was more mystery.

It's easy to call the film manipulative and cheesy and predictable...it most certainly is. However, I loved this film, and I can assure you that I did NOT expect to. I'm not sure what exactly I did expect, but I went into this movie fearing the worst; after the wildly mixed reviews, and having nearly overdosed on Cinema Cheese in the terribly disappointing 'The Majestic', I was a bit leery of this film. Much to my surprise, I came out of the theater feeling supremely satisfied.The film poses its audience a rather difficult question should a mentally retarded man be allowed to raise a young child, even if he is the biological father? It's bound to leave its audience sharply divided, and this is part of the reason that it could likely spark a love-hate reaction in viewers. I won't bother discussing my views on this subject, I'll leave that up to you. But I will say that the movie made me think, and it made me reassess the values I cherish in life and love. IT goes without saying that any discussion of this film begins and ends with Sean Penn's knockout performance. While I do agree with some fellow IMDB users and a certain film critic that playing mentally retarded individuals is usually just a ploy for Oscar consideration, there's no getting around the fact that I Am Sam underlines the rationale that Sean Penn is, indeed, the greatest acting talent of his generation. His character may be seemingly simple minded, but his trademark raw emotion is conveyed so beautifully that he adds a whole other dimension to the character that could not possibly have been on paper. And as for Michelle Pfeiffer...she's simply wonderful, as always. She's always boasted the sort of fascinating screen presence that recalls the ladies of Hollywood's Golden Age, but in recent years she's become more comfortable than ever onscreen. She exudes so much charisma and finesse that she makes acting look like the easiest job in the world, all the while bringing about her own personal touch to the character. Many critics have called this one of her best roles, and I would have to agree. However, this is also the biggest fault in the film. Her screen time is surprisingly a LOT less than one would expect going in, and her character is never as fully developed as she should be. I also wish the movie would have focused more on her relationship to Sam. At one point in the film there seems to be a very clear hint of romance in this interaction, but it never amounts to anything. Perhaps it was intended to be conveyed ever so subtly, or perhaps the studio was too afraid of how audiences would react to a possible romance between a hot shot lawyer and a retarded man. Either way, I think that this sort of edginess would have heightended the emotional impact of the film.I Am Sam is not a perfect film by any stretch, but it's so incredibly good hearted and truly riveting that I don't see the need to pick apart its shortcomings. It's a worthy film to view, and regardless of whether your reaction to the film is negative or positive, it will surely be a potent response. And in this age of instantly forgettable films, that is a worthy accomplishment in itself. My Grade B+NOTE It's interesting to point out that this film, released in 2001, is often rather similar to a certain film released in 2000....The Next Best Thing, which starred Penn's ex-wife, Madonna. Both films consciously reference the classic Kramer vs. Kramer in depicting a father's struggle to defy societal prejudice in an attempt to gain custody of his child. It's not a particularly relevant detail, but in a year that began with films directed by Penn and Guy Ritchie (Madonna's husband) being released in America the very same weekend, I'd say it's worth pointing out.

A bit too far-fetched because this pseudo-conspiracy includes the British royal family and a fanatic Masonic &#145;sect'. Nevertheless, the movie does a fine job at hinting to the ridiculousness of religious and ethnic discrimination, and it succeeds in portraying the oppression of low-class women.Johnny Depp returns as the serious investigator (as last seen in Sleepy Hollow, notice the similarities?); he portrays Inspector Abberline, who follows his intuition and visions to solve his cases, and is appointed to solve this particular mystery. Depp's performance is genuine because he obviously takes his role very seriously. Abberline is clever, melancholic, psychoanalytical, clairvoyant, and, above all as opposed to his superiors, moral, even human. He is troubled of course, having lost his family in tragic circumstances, and is addicted to opium and laudanum, which aid him in his &#145;visions'. In the end, he sacrifices his relationship with Mary Kelly (and consequently his only chance for happiness) out of fear for her safety. An epic 'hero', more or less.The presence of his assistant (Robbie Coltrane, Hagrid in Harry Potter) is fortunate. I say fortunate because his character prevents the movie from taking itself too seriously. His sarcasm is tinted with genuine compassion towards the murderer's victims and a respectful affection towards Abberline. Coltrane gives a truly fine performance there, though it doesn't compare to Ian Holm's.Ian Holm (Bilbo in The Fellowship of the Ring) plays a double-role in the movie, and the transition from the poised physician to the devilish fanatic was remarkably done in terms of facial expression, voice tone, elocution, and, symbolically, size and makeup. In its own way, this movie is expressionistic. The prostitutes, or &#145;unfortunates' as they would rather call them, look and sound exactly as they're supposed to. They are worn-out, cynical, foulmouthed, but, in their own way, they look after each other. The odd one out here is the female lead, Mary Kelly, played by Heather Graham (argh!). She is too clean, too pure, and too elegant to be the companion of the other women. She is supposed to be of Irish decent, and naturally, the filmmakers made her a red-head. And a flamboyant one at that, with obviously dyed hair. Her so-called Irish accent sounds as convincing as my Swahili. If you should ever want to cast Heather Graham for your film, make sure you never show a close-up of her face; she's got the most inexpressive pair of painted ping-pong balls, er, eyes, I've ever seen. And now for the visuals the only description that would fit here is &#145;psychedelic'. London has never looked foggier, with a smoky red sky and overall reddish ambiance. Abberline's visions of the murders are somewhat unsettling and gory (blood, flies on body parts, hazy photography etc...), but it's never cheap horror. Even the murder scenes are cleverly &#145;choreographed' so that we experience the act more through sound and feel rather than explicit violence. The whole mood of the movie is more graphically melancholic and dark than cheap and gory, really.Though not quite &#145;from hell', it's the survival of the fittest in the gloomy streets of Victorian London, where corruption rules till the end.
