You're a god damn sword boat captain, is there anything better in the world? Ordinarily I would write a review that is fair minded and as honest as I can call it, something that hopefully would interest the readers either side of the fence. But here with The Perfect Storm I just want to write why I love this particular picture, and what a most divisive picture it has turned out to be. I'm aware of the complaints about the movie, even the ones from the family of the real Captain Billy Tyne played by Alpha Male regular George Clooney, but as an entertaining spectacle with huge slices of emotional fortitude, The Perfect Storm will forever be hitting my spots. The character build up is just wonderful, people with things to prove, fractured and blossoming romances, loyalties on the line, grudges carried over from previous encounters, the lives of sea fishermen fully formed in the films first quarter. Then there is a sequence as George Clooney says the monologue that I have opened this review with, beautifully recited, but it's the emotion in Linda Greenlaw's face (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio) as she watches and listens to him speak it, just wonderful. Then the boys go out to see, heading off into dangerous waters to hopefully make a killing in the fish market, tensions run high, accidents happen, heroes are born and rivalries quickly overturned, but the boys must go further if they are to corner the market, the Grand Banks are evil at this time of year. A three pronged hostile weather front is heading their way, they are, as Linda tells Billy on the radio, heading into the belly of the monster, and what a monster it is. Here the makers excel, director Wolfgang Petersen, his cinematographer John Seale and his S\/E maestro John Frazier do literally put me right there in a amongst the waves and derringdo bravado. Then it's the final couple of reels, the emotional mangler, even a spiritual coda that is hated by so many can't make me dislike the film any less, and I'll wager right here and now that as funeral eulogies go, few if any have been delivered with as much heartbreaking emotion as the one read by Mastrantonio here. All of which is backed by a truly involving score by James Horner, shades of Braveheart's emotional swirls in there. It's a personal opinion you know, but The Perfect Storm is a magnificent film that I enjoy three times a year, every year, and nobody will ever be able to take that away from me.

Both things may be happening at the same time; all characters--or some--may be just outward projections of forces inside Miss Giddens' subconscious mind; or these forces, while still present, are being reflected on real individuals, like on a mirror--or on real ghosts. These ghosts may be there or not, true, and if they aren't, her feverish mind is creating them anyway. Also, Mrs. Grose, Miles, Flora may be just as well real people as simple symbols of elements dwelling in Miss Giddens' psyche. Here's my interpretation A chance encounter with Uncle sexually arouses her. He notices it but he makes clear he isn't interested. He's an experienced lover and he sees her just a prepubescent girl; a ten year old in an adult woman's body. Here's where the characters Flora & Miles appear--in their full symbolic meaning. By bringing them up, by linking her future with theirs, Uncle decides that all three belong together as they are at a similar stage of sexual (in)maturity. This explains why he has no use for the kids either--as he doesn't have it for her--as they all dwell in an evolutionary stage he left behind decades ago; both kids have a physical age similar to her sexual, also. If you don't see it this way, then why they have to be both precisely of that age; why they are not infants, teenagers?--the answer is because in the first case their sexuality wouldn't be an issue and in the second, it would be one already settled. So, it is all about her psychological and sexual underdevelopment here. Miles & Flora could be acting as external projections of her tattered psyche; or, if they are real people, as mirrors on which her repressed Id--the natural instincts she's fighting&#x97;-is being reflected. (See for ex. how terrified she's of uncontrolled natural forces wind, rainstorm; even of running horses, etc. This is even better illustrated when she sees just an innocuous flower vase in the thunderstorm Flora drew.) Writers know that, the least background you give to a character the greater the chances are it doesn't represent a real person but something more abstract. See for ex., as the 3 people in Bly don't have any history or any autonomous life; just like in Others. They all just came out of thin air. Mrs. Grose has no life other than that at the Manor and the kids could have well fallen from the sky for all we know; we don't know anything about their past lives or their dead parents. So what the script is saying is that these three people may be something else; they may be representing instead components a human psyche&#x97;with Mrs. Grose playing the Super Ego and the kids, the Id.It seems I'm seeing the divided psyche in too many films but blame scriptwriters for that, as they are the ones putting it there. Speaking of that, The Gilmore Girls may be used for comparison. There, Super--Ego Emily is constantly nagging daughter Lorelei to be alert, so granddaughter Rory won't lose her virginity. But Ego--Lorelei resents such unwelcome intrusion, as she considers herself, and Rory, sophisticated enough to be able to deal with Rory's nascent sexual life. Yet, Super Ego Emily has a good point, as it was at that same age--Rory's--that Lorelei got pregnant and, in her opinion, ruined her life. But everything ends well there, the reason for that being that what we got in G.G. is a healthy psyche&#x97;one built around a well balanced, fully developed, Ego-Lorelei&#x97;which is not the case in TI. Here Ego--Miss Giddens is not only sexually immature but utterly repressed also, and any intent to change that will leads to hysterics; so in her case she's condemned to fail (of course Uncle will be thrilled to know she's desperately trying to repress her sexuality, instead of freeing it!).Mrs. Grose gives the crucial clues in her warnings, as she embodies not only the morals of the times but also the voices of reason--she's like a library containing the accumulated experience. That's why even considering that what the lovers did in was disgusting, she recognizes that isn't something that could be repressed, eliminated, even when it affects the kids (and how could Quint & Miss Jesser have sexually abused them anyway, when they kept telling them to knock first?. In any case we have to see these kids rather as physical projections of Miss Giddens' sexual development, even if we may consider them also, alternatively, as real people. See also how a Super Ego may recommend diverse courses of action in Emily's case it recommends sexual repression--because of bad past experiences--while in Mrs. Grose's case it advises to let things follow their course. By not listening to her, by trying to repress her own sexuality at all costs, because of her brutally fundamentalist upbringing, Miss Giddens cuts herself from it&#x97;by alienating Flora & killing Miles--and so she finally ruins what could have been her own future love life. With that final kiss to Miles she's not saying farewell to a real kid&#x97;even if that may be the case--but mainly to her own sexual life. It's for herself, for her atrophied Id that she's crying, not for anyone else. 8\/10.

A scene close to the beginning of the movie it shows young men who are encouraged to for fight and die for the father land. Most are excited to go off and serve for their country although some are hesitant they all end up enlisting. They go off and find that war is hell but stay to fight, serve and die for their country.The story was while written for the most part but a few things did bother me. One of those thing was the French soldier (if you've seen the movie you'll know what I mean, if not stop reading now). The problem I had with it is if the soldier Paul played by Lew Ayres was fighting for three or more years and was hardened by battle should not have a problem with killing one more soldier. Another problem I had was the American accents, I had to keep remembering they were German or it just seem like an alternate history of the Americans trying to capture France. The only way you could real tell they were German was from their uniforms. Something else I did not like was the battles it was either motor fire killing troops in a field without any gun fire or a machine gun cutting down soldiers down with little to no fighting back. This isn't true for all scenes of fighting but will be seen a few times throughout the movie.The real strong point of this movie, and the only reason I gave it anything over five was the acting. I thought the acting was good nothing truly amazing but still memorable to say the least. Another point I like was the older soldiers especially Kat. He was the one guy I think every war movie needs, and what really strengthened the scenes of fighting. The reason I believe he is a character every war movie needs is because he is the unflinching tough been through everything in battle soldier with a kind heart and a watchful eye over the younger troops. The other major selling point of the movie to me was Paul and his mom. This really brought together and put some purpose behind Paul and gave us a better understanding of him as a person and soldier. The last thing that Paul did on his leave made this movie in my opinion. He goes back to his old school were his former teacher is preaching the same thing he told Paul and his class mates the years before. Paul over hears this and gives an amazing speech to the young boys about the horror of war, this is disregarded by the boys as they are ready to fight and die for the country and Paul is seen as a coward and unpatriotic to his country.Overall for a 1930 movie I think it was really well made for the year but war movies have progressed so much in the eighty one ears since it's release. With that being said I think it's great and should be watched if you are a fan of war movies. Although it isn't all fighting and action this is a classic film and has really stood the stand of time being eighty one years old and ultimately still being entertaining is worth a watch and fans of classic war movies will fall in love with this film but it isn't for everyone.

Although it isn't all fighting and action this is a classic film and has really stood the stand of time being eighty one years old and ultimately still being entertaining is worth a watch and fans of classic war movies will fall in love with this film but it isn't for everyone.

Having seen the radical changes that can take place over a directorial career, I was a little afraid that Clint's earlier stuff might disappoint.A late-night jazz DJ, Dave Garver is not unfamiliar with the ladies. When, one night after his show, he runs into Evelyn, the woman who regularly phones in to request he play Misty for her, it marks the beginning of a fanatical obsession on her part. As Dave tries to give her the cold shoulder and reunite with his former love Tobie, Evelyn becomes more and more determined to have the man she idolises.Much as I avoided straying too far from the past decade's Clint output for fear of a lesser quality, my systematic run-through of his career both before and behind the camera demanded I eventually come to his early works. As his directorial debut, 1971's Play Misty for Me was the natural film to turn to. Having by then appeared in three films each for both Don Siegel and Sergio Leone, Eastwood learned from observation, founded his own production company, and insisted he be allowed to direct as well as star. And he fulfils both roles fantastically, showcasing himself as a consummate professional either side of the camera. In his performance as the near-womanising DJ, Eastwood is a combination of emotionally aloof in his dealings with Evelyn and sensitively sophisticated with Tobie. Though his harshness in dealing with his fanatic stalker is perhaps a little cruel, we like this character, his genuine attempts to regain the love of the woman he truly feels for endearing him to us despite the partial misogyny he exhibits. Jessica Walter, playing the role of Evelyn, is variously hilarious, terrifying, sympathetic, and indeed pathetic. The range of moods and emotions Walter manages is phenomenal, her sudden behavioral turns lending a manic freneticism to a character who is already quite well written. We cannot help but laugh as she neatly inserts herself into Garver's life, her inability to pick up his less-than-subtle hints quietly comic. She is doubtlessly the film's greatest strength, crafting a character that we fear, feel sorry for, and find annoying, often all at once. The plot requires a leap in faith at one point, rather stumbling in an upsettingly gaping hole, but this is a small worry in the grand scheme of things. As for Eastwood's direction, he does a very fine first time job, many scenes featuring the glorious darkened lighting he prefers and would later perfect with cinematographer Tom Stern. It is used well here, an interesting example in the articulation of the director's distinct style. Notable are the usages of jump cuts, twice employed here, rather surprising for Eastwood, and oddly evocative of the New Hollywood movement which was blossoming at the time. The more obvious of these two seems a reference to A Bout de Soufflé, bizarrely, not something I would have imagined among Clint's influences. Overall, the direction was controlled, confident, and far from the disappointment I feared it might maybe be.A very strong debut for Eastwood behind the camera, Play Misty for Me is a classic thriller story which functions very well with the aid of its central performances. Walter's acting is particularly noteworthy, almost inescapably comparable to the later Oscar-winning and fantastic performance of Cathy Bates in Misery, which I just happen to consider it superior to. The first of an astounding 31 films directed in a 40 year period, the film holds up well to the director's many later masterpieces.

His monument is now a growing and prosperous India that is slowly eradicating poverty form its borders. Gandhi would approve of that, he was not just for independence for the sake of independence, he was deeply interested in the kind of society that would result after the British left India. India's growing prosperity would please him, the religious and ethnic struggles still prevalent in that part of the world would not.The problem in discussing a film like Gandhi is that discussions will overlap into the life of the subject as opposed to the quality of the film. Richard Attenborough having lived a lot of his life during the time when these events took place remembered them well. He's got an eye for the sweep and grandeur of the story, but the life of Gandhi here is never overwhelmed by the spectacle of the film.

Ironically enough one of his competitors was Paul Newman who got a nomination for The Verdict which I consider his best performance and my personal favorite of his films. For me to say Kingsley deserved it over him is quite an admission.Gandhi was a devout Hindhu, but he was a man of vision who saw some of the injustices of fundamentalist and exclusionary religious beliefs. Born in the Brahmin caste, he fought against the caste system where social status was stratified by religion in ancient times and people could not rise from it. He was a believer in a land of opportunity, careers that were open to talent. He also was against male domination and treated women as equals.

Some of the violence during our civil rights struggles in the American south was nothing compared to the Amritsar massacre when as the British commander he opened fire on a peaceful rally and slaughtered hundreds of men, women, and children. We put Nazis to death for atrocities committed in World War II, yet little happened to Dyer except he was put on the shelf and buried like an embarrassment which he certainly was.

But some politicians like Winston Churchill and press barons like Lord Beaverbrooke whipped up a lot of fear in the Tory ranks for granting independence.

Faces faces reality like a telescopic mirror. Never had desperation and starving needs of love and respect looked so poignantly authentic. Not just because of the visions our discomforted eyes witness during these 24 hours of shouting, talking, arguing and laughing, but also, thanks to Cassavettes' genius directing, using close-ups on characters, so they can never lie or play. And when all the basis of the bourgeois way of life is hypocrisy, Faces plays a cathartic role, allowing us to stand back and realize that these faces are nothing else but ours.I can't count how many times Faces made me think Oh, my God! This is so real though I don't belong to any social category represented in this film, but this is more than slices of life stories about tired businessmen and disillusioned wives, all eager to maintain their sex or love appeal. Faces is about human relationships and the profound effect time exercise on men and women, old and young, married or single. Every interaction with people is guided by a personal approach to life and fear of death, inspiring to each character from this masterpiece a specific attitude, magnified in these denuding and disturbing close-ups. We can't help but feel a bit voyeuristic to watch them like this, but this indecency relies less on the actions than the disturbing truths they highlight. Faces is what prevails behind the masks of conformity, like the truest expression of the regrets and hopes governing our lives. Faces as Cassavettes's tribute to humanity and its poignant vulnerability. Vulnerability doesn't come easy in our relationships with strangers. Richard Frost, the businessman, portrayed by John Marley, personifies the fragility of an old man who must know where his life is going. Life is valuable and must focus on strong principles. Then he hides his doubt and weaknesses under a ludicrous carpet made of bad jokes and a manic laugh that doesn't fool anyone. When he's drunk with his friend (and never a drunk scene has been so realistic), he still tries to keep his dignity intact, and when Jeannie, played by a beautiful and delicate Gena Rowlands, criticizes the concept of friendship, he disagrees and expresses with seriousness its value then realizes that seriousness itself, is an overrated concept. Indeed, his best friend acts like a clown, then makes harsh remarks that hurt Jeannie's feelings, reminding her she's a whore. Jeannie disarms him, saying that he just doesn't know how to behave, and use aggressiveness as a mask to hide his vulnerability, hurting not to be hurt. They're all powerful businessmen, but yet vulnerable in their incapability to admit their doubts, their dependence of this cruel need to prove their manhood. This puerile pride is illustrated in a ridiculous fight scene between Richard and Jim, another executive played by Val Avery. When they realize how childishly they acted, they started talking like regular businessmen. But the need was still there. Need is the key word of Faces, especially in the second part featuring the disillusioned wives of those men and Chet, a young swinger hippie they just met in a nightclub and brilliantly portrayed by Seymour Cassel. One of the women, played by Lynn Carlin, is Maria, Richard's wife, who's just been told by her husband, much older than her, that they should divorce. All these women know about their men and try to forget the emptiness of their marital situation, especially after the kids grew up and left the house. Inevitably, the need of being loved, desired and respected emerges back and spoils the evening. When a woman, encouraged by Chet, overcomes her shyness and starts dancing with him, she defensively reacts to Chet's let's not make a fool of ourselves and replies with hostility before leaving the house unaware that she's just made the wrong point. One of the friends understands that she's just doing this to make herself look honorable to forget her marriage's failure. Women also wear masks, using their status of accomplished mothers as an alibi to keep some ounces of dignity. The only one who doesn't care for dignity sees Chet with her drunk eyes as the opposite of her ugly uninteresting husband, and begs him for a poignant, but pitiful kiss.This pity is the response for fear and desperation. The climactic scene between Chet and Maria, will haunt me forever the desperation when he tries to make her throw up, as to exorcise all the pain she accumulated is disturbingly poignant. This is a woman that can't play anymore, she just hates her life, and is too weak to simulate happiness. During a very insightful speech, Chet summarizes the whole point of the film, everything is almost mechanical, anyone, beautiful, ugly, happy or miserable is wearing a mask, and nothing matters more than the truth, honesty and the personal quest for happiness. This looks like the happy ending of a coming-of-age film, but this is brutally interrupted by Richard's arrival. We don't know what's going to happen next, Richard wanted a divorce but realized his disenchantment cost him his ability to love again, Maria lets him sitting on the stairs, after telling him, she's disgusted by her life, will she meet leave him or meet Chet again? Will Jeannie continue to wear this beautiful mask to hide her fear of not being attractive anymore? Are all these questions really relevant? Cassavettes point is not to teach, but to reveal, to show the face of truth in its poignant fragility. These are the faces, the rest is just feces.

You will be delighted to realize just how subversive this intelligent witty film is. In fact Pollyanna's surname IS Wittier. People who carp that this is a syrupy sweet film and moan about Disney saccharine movies are missing the point. POLLYANNA is a sly film about misuse of power, loneliness, bullying and meanness using a good natured teen to counterpoint a town of adults who have lost their way in their own lives. She has to be a strong opposite in order for each adult to have a revelation about their own unpleasant behavior. The key adult is her Aunt Polly who has not had sex for a long time, as a result she is bitter and bossy and all the town is afraid to stand up to her. Aunt Polly's sexual frustration is pointed out several times because, in a family film as sharp as this you can have very adult situations wrapped in gauze and acceptable as a character flaw. Pollyanna simply by being positive (and clever and funny) has a profound affect on everyone in need of re awakening. Pollyanna even takes on the hypocrisy of the church and the contents of the bible One astonishing and powerful scene is in an open field on a very hot day with the church Pastor (a terrific Karl Malden) is practicing his latest fire and brimstone scare campaign. Pollyanna visits him and by being her intelligent self politely demolishes his mindset. He is found later by his wife collapsed with a overwhelming awareness of where he has been wrong. He then becomes a catalyst for motivating the town to stand up to Aunt Polly's sabotage of all their lives. What is so deliciously refreshing about POLLYANNA is that is it simple courtesy and commonsense from the mouth of a confident blossoming 13 year old girl (as 'the future') ...the milk mustache scene is completely THERE in mid screen for any slow learners. The direction is terrific and hilarious and there are many big laughs in small moments scattered through the film; Jimmy and the fish, Pollyanna imitating a cow chewing, the granny playing the drums, Pollyanna being handed sandwiches while hiding in a bush in the conservatory.... loads of crowd pleasing moments for a big audience of families to relish. Particularly moving is the whole subplot about the prisms of light. Agnes Moorehead has a hilarious turn as a hypochondriac who comes good and helps find Pollyanna a doll. Many many matching emotional moments all through this film. Adolph Menjou also has a great spot as the town scary man supposedly with a cellar full of slaves and rats. So take my advice and look for the wickedly funny jokes at the expanse of the status quo and have a wonderful time laughing and wiping tears with your kids and you embrace every magnificently produced sly comedy moment of this utterly clever heartwarming film. POLLYANNA is a complete success. Even vintage car enthusiast are included in the delighted audience for this film. The very funny opening scene of the naked boy swinging on a rope will alert you to the fact this is a film with a very wicked agenda. The production values of antiques costumes and gorgeous visuals are as lavish as MY FAIR LADY. And thank your lucky stars that it wasn't remade with Lindsay Lohan as THE PARENT TRAP was.

","genre":"Drama, Family"},{"date":"5 February 2011","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" We begin with the titular Raging Bull gearing up before a contest, not one inside of ring but just prior to one of his stage duels in which he takes on the audience telling stories and anecdotes that pull in the crowds and the money. The man is Robert De Niro 's Jake La Motta; it's 1964, and after the brief practising of several lines to himself speaking of how he remembers every hit and every knock down and practically every detail of his in-ring boxing career, we dart back to 1941 to where it all began. With the benefit of hindsight, we're able to recall a number of other characters portrayed by De Niro in other Scorsese films in the form of Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy, and the memorable monologues they brought about, before arriving at the conclusion this character we're observing here and now for the first time may very well be as disturbed as the other two in said examples. When La Motta speaks, there's a sense of specificity or intrinsics about the man's verbal confirmation of living his boxing life to the full, and the ability to take in the more minute details of what unravelled in the ring; Martin Scorsese's film eventually coming to resemble an inmost and often distressingly intrinsic study of this man's life from his young adult years to entering old age.Scorsese doesn't doubt as to whether La Motta was a champion, without Scorsese's film one might champion him as a magnificent physical specimen and a champion athlete, but the manner as to which La Motta went about attaining this reputation, it seems and particularly at one point, sees him mercilessly hammer away at an opponent in a manner fuelled by hallucinations; scociopathic tendencies and mass hysteria that his wife, a long suffering Vickie (Moriarty) 'likes' the man he's fighting. But the film is as much a tale of the man outside of the ring as it is a tale of the man inside; how he came to be as aggressive and ruthlessly efficient as he was and how balancing that duality between an on-stage and off-stage persona through his aggression and anger became blurred and difficult to balance out. Raging Bull's immediate opening is a tranquil, beautiful almost, passage of slow motion as La Motta occupies the ring alone to some angelic music; that sense of it being of the picturesque sort and that La Motta truthfully belonged in the ring amidst everything else comes to feel prominent. In and around the scuzzy living of New York in whatever year, as the loitering with the sorts of people La Motta hangs with features more and more, the locale or space of the boxing ring comes to represent a very harmonious and very magnificent zone in which he totally finds his element and makes his name. It is a place of violence and often bloodshed, to La Motta through Scorsese's eyes, it was a small squared zone in which the lead was at one with himself.The film covers his life and times, his friends and foes; his wife and her hardships as well as his brother in Joey (Pesci), a man whom appears to be the only one capable of talking any degree of sense into the lead but additionally someone who has his own problems with violence and misogyny.

But the film is as much a tale of the man outside of the ring as it is a tale of the man inside; how he came to be as aggressive and ruthlessly efficient as he was and how balancing that duality between an on-stage and off-stage persona through his aggression and anger became blurred and difficult to balance out. Raging Bull's immediate opening is a tranquil, beautiful almost, passage of slow motion as La Motta occupies the ring alone to some angelic music; that sense of it being of the picturesque sort and that La Motta truthfully belonged in the ring amidst everything else comes to feel prominent. In and around the scuzzy living of New York in whatever year, as the loitering with the sorts of people La Motta hangs with features more and more, the locale or space of the boxing ring comes to represent a very harmonious and very magnificent zone in which he totally finds his element and makes his name.

The gun belonged to the man. The car might have been yours, or that young couple across the aisle. What you will see in the next seventy minutes could have happened to you. For the facts are actual.The above opening salvo from the film is not without merit, tho due to the Hays Office requirements Lupino had to tone down her initial plans for the film. The story is based on the true story of murderer Billy Cook, who in 1950 posed as a hitch-hiker and murdered a family of five and a travelling salesman. The film picks up with the aftermath of that, where Cook then kidnapped two friends out hunting and forced them at gunpoint to drive him across the border into Mexico. Lupino researched her subject well, even interviewing the principals in the kidnapping.Something of a cult favourite these days, The Hitch-Hiker is a brisk, lean and tight film showing how to get the maximum amount of suspense out of the simplest of set-ups. Practically a three character piece, the film thrives on claustrophobia and an impending sense of dread. Even when the characters come out of the confines of the car, we still feel stifled during the sequences that feature the men out in the desert. There's a sense of desolation in the landscape that marries up with the emotional state of our two kidnapped men. It's fine work by Lupino, who never lets the mood slip. She in turn is aided considerably by her writers and Musuraca's photography. The former cleverly only lets the kidnapped men's personalities unfold once they are seized by Talman's psychopath, the latter brings film noir agoraphobia to the Alabama Hills, Lone Pine, location A place that was often shown to be gorgeous in many a fine Western in the 50s.All three lead actors do good work under Lupino's direction, with Talman particularly menacing, all lazy eye and snarly grins. While Stevens' music sits nicely with the tone of the story. Credit Lupino, too, for not letting her male driven movie contain any machismo posturing, or heaven forbid, testosterone fuelled bravado. Where the film does fall down is with its rather anti-climatic finale. For although the real life finale involving Billy Cook was genuinely mundane, the film's ending is also a bit of a damp squib. It's one of those cases where some poetic licence wouldn't have gone amiss. Still, it's far from a deal breaker, the film remains a taut and moodily enjoyable experience. 7.5\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"5 February 2011","score":"3 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Out of RKO Radio Pictures, The Hitch-Hiker is directed by Ida Lupino and jointly adapted to the screen by Lupino, Collier Young and Daniel Mainwaring.

Director Tony Kaye's use of color wasn't to just simply help the viewer understand scenes that take place in the present and scenes that happen in the past. The motive of color goes deeper, as the present day scenes of color show us how Derek now views the world, with all its color and diversity.

Racially charged films show how their characters justify their hate. Much like Clint Eastwood's film, Gran Torino, the main character, Walt, drew his hatred for minorities from his war experiences.

Here he recruited the scared and disenfranchised white kids in the neighborhood who were tired of living in fear of the growing local minority dominate gangs. Now, Derek has just been released from prison after serving time for the murder of 2 black, local gang members, who were trying to steal his car. As an older, wiser Derek emerges from prison, has he been released in time to save his family from the wide reaching grip of violence and racial tensions created by his own rhetoric? Director Tony Kaye's use of color wasn't to just simply help the viewer understand scenes that take place in the present and scenes that happen in the past. The motive of color goes deeper, as the present day scenes of color show us how Derek now views the world, with all its color and diversity. This is a stark contrast from the Derek of the past, whose view was much narrower and he saw the world as simple as black and white. Also, the use of low-key lighting during the past and the racially charged scene shows the clouded views of hate that Derek and others have of their surrounding world. Racially charged films show how their characters justify their hate. Much like Clint Eastwood's film, Gran Torino, the main character, Walt, drew his hatred for minorities from his war experiences. In American History X, Derek's hate was driven, in most part, by the senseless murder of his father (Morrissey & Kaye, 1998). This racially charged film shows that the world we live in isn't as simple as black and white.

Five years later & Buttercup is engaged to be married to Prince Humperdinck (Chris Sarandon) even though she has no love for him, shortly before the marriage Buttercup is kidnapped by a man named Vizzini (Wallace Shawn) who then sets sail for the kingdom of Guilder where he plans to kill Buttercup in order to start a war between Guilder & Florin but Buttercup is saved by whom she thinks is the dread pirate Roberts with Prince Humperdinck & his army close behind...Produced & directed by Rob Reiner this was written by William Goldman based on his 1973 novel of the same name, while not drastically different I haven't read the book so cannot compare the two but I really enjoyed the film on many levels for it's action, it's adventure, it cuteness & sense of humour. There's a neat wraparound story in which peter Falk tells the story of The Princess Bride to his young grandson & there are several amusing moments in which we cut back to the pair who make several comments, the sort of comments that a young boy might make while listening to an old fashioned fairytale but it's also nice to see him become engrossed & caught up in the story like anyone watching The Princess Bride will, the point that mere words on a page can captivate as much as a computer game is well made. I would call The Princess Bride itself more of a swashbuckling adventure adventure yarn rather than a straight fairytale, for some reason the fantasy elements are downplayed quite a lot with only giant Rats & Westley being brought back to life (if he was dead anyway which is never made totally clear) the only fantasy aspects. The Princess Bride seems more interested in amusing one-liners, sharp, witty dialogue & sword fight action which is fine as it all adds up to a throughly enjoyable light hearted fantasy romance. In fact the main aspect that The Princess Bride lifts from the average fairytale is the idea of true love conquers all, it's a strong & constant theme throughout thankfully without ever getting to mushy or sentimental. The Princess Bride manages almost perfectly to balance seriousness & parody with an assortment of wonderfully drawn character's all of whom have great personality & some great moments. At just over an hour & a half the film never lacks pace & keeps moving all the time, it's easy to see why the young Fred Savage gets so engrossed in The Princess Bride & I am sure most viewers will feel exactly the same way.As I mentioned earlier I am a bit disappointed at the lack of overt fantasy elements, even the settings & locations from woods & ancient Castles look a little drab. The ROUS (Rodents of Unusual Size) are dwarf actor's in Rat suits which look a little tatty but at least they have fluid movement & still look better than a modern CGI computer effect probably would. There are some great fencing & sword fighting scenes, some of the best you will ever see to be fair as th makers don't seem to go for historic accuracy or realism & just go to town with various stunts & improbable gymnastics.With a supposed budget of about $16,000,000 the production values are good & it looks nice enough having been mostly filmed on location here in England. The acting is good, Cary Elwes as the smooth, handsome & likable Westley shines although Robin Wright is a little flat in comparison. Billy Crystal, Mel Smith & Peter Cook all have comedic roles.The Princess Bride is a highly entertaining & witty play on the old fairytale clichés that is a cracking action adventure film in it's own right. What's not like? I thought it was clever & humorous & heartfelt & exciting. Definitely recommended.

Its pace is very measured, opening with a lengthy sequence set on a train which shows mild-mannered Cleveland accountant William Blake (Johnny Depp) taking a VERY long train journey. He slips in and out of sleep and encounters a cryptically philosophical and very sooty Train Fireman (Crispin Glover) before finally arriving at the frontier town of Machine.Alighting from the train, Blake heads towards his new job as accountant at a foundry. As he is walking apprehensively through town, he sees a man in an alley being fellated by a woman. The man points his gun at Blake, who quickly lowers his gaze and walks on hurriedly. This single shot of simulated oral sex was hugely controversial and almost resulted in the film being banned. Fortunately it was not.Arriving at the town, Blake finds that his position has already been filled. He demands to see the boss, John Dickinson (Robert Mitchum), a fearsome man who embodies the shoot-first-ask-questions-later savagery of the Old West. Dickinson trains a shotgun on the hapless Blake and tells him to get the hell out of his sight. Wisely, Blake hightails it out of there, with the cruel laughter of John Scholfield (John Hurt) - one of the foundry's employees - ringing in his ears.Crestfallen and almost broke, Blake stumbles into the town's salon to drown his sorrows. He meets Thel Russell (Mili Avital) who is eking out a living selling paper flowers. She takes Blake to her bed, where they are discovered by Charlie Dickinson (Gabriel Byrne), Thel's former lover. Charlie takes great exception to Blake's presence and tries to shoot him, but hits Thel instead, who is killed. Charlie shoots again, inflicting a mortal wound upon Blake which will eventually kill him. Blake shoots Charlie dead and goes on the run into the wilderness.For Blake, the hand of fate just keeps dealing him bad cards. Charlie is the son of the shotgun-toting, cigar-chomping John Dickinson, and John - furious at the loss of his beloved son - hires three killers to find and dispatch Blake. These guns for hire are the taciturn Cole Wilson (Lance Henriksen), the loquacious Conway Twill (Michael Wincott), and Johnny 'the Kid' Pickett (Eugene Byrd), and they set out on Blake's trail with murder on their minds.Blake meets a husky Indian named Nobody (Gary Farmer) and the two become travelling companions. Blake embarks upon a deeply spiritual and mystical journey with Nobody as his spirit guide. Nobody oversees Blake's transition from the physical world of life, to the spirit world of death.This is a wonderful film with a cast to die for. In addition to all the names already mentioned, there are also appearances by Iggy Pop, Billy Bob Thornton, and Alfred Molina.

He has an Italian girlfriend, Susanna (Valeria Golino) and his only real concerns are himself and money.

On the way Charlie gets frustrated with Ray's needs and routine, not understanding his condition but also slowly builds a relationship with this relative he did not know he had.For this role Mr. Cruise was in full scumbag mode and he has proved he can do repulsive roles really well. His character Charlie is truly a dislikeable character who only cares about himself; but the story of Charlie follows basic screen writing rules of what he wants and needs. What Charlie wants is money but what he really needs is a family and get to know his brother. Cruise was obviously trying to flex his acting muscles for this role. Hoffman made sure that he gave Ray a lot of traits like talking to himself and lives on a routine of certain food and television problems. He does seem like a man who lives in own world and can not interact with people. He does give a good performance and it was obvious Oscar bait. The two men work best during more tender moments where Charlie gets to find out more about Ray and their past and Charlie does develop a more caring bond with his brother.To me Barry Levinson is a hit and miss director he has made some really good films like Sleepers and Wag the Dog, but he has made turkeys like Sphere to balance things out. With Rain Man he does a standard but he does have a few moments of flair a moment I particularly liked was when the camera follows Charlie and Susanna when they are having an argument. But for most of the time all Levinson needs to do point the camera in the right place and let the actors just interact with each other and make sure there are some nice wide shots and make sure there is a decent editing job.

Carl Brashear (Cuba Gooding Jr.) is bound and determined, against all odds, to become the first African American Navy Diver, during a period of time where racism was the norm. Leslie Billy Sunday (Robert DeNiro) is a racist, grouchy Navy trainer; he is set on seeing Carl fail. Ultimately, Navy life will bring these two men together in a story of life's troubles and life's rewards. Men of Honor elaborates on racial discrimination as one of the major themes. Carl's dream to become a Navy diver had nothing to do with being a black man. However, as it comes to be, Carl will be the first black man to succeed. The road that takes him from a cook to a diver will consist of many hurdles he will have to overcome. With the help of his wife, Jo (Aunjanue Ellis) Carl will pass his classes. However, Carl will also have to overcome the hurdles from the Navy men he trains with and the top Navy officials who do not want Carl as a Navy diver. We will also watch Billy Sunday struggle through Navy life, alcoholism and his own internal voices, struggling with what is right and wrong with passing Carl through diving school. Both Carl and Bill understand to be the very best, they may have to break a few rules. Regardless, these two men never give up on what they believe in, they are 'men of honor'.The technique of the camera angles allows the viewers to feel the motion of the ship and water. The camera often gives the viewers the feeling that they are directly in the scene, part of the scene. Broad views show the viewers the scenery as they change; from the open dirt fields of the farm, to the oceans so blue, into the Navy training camp. Several motifs come to mind. First were the blisters on Mac Brashear's (Carl Lumbly) hands, from plowing the fields. Again the significance of hand blisters comes to light when Carl stands outside the dive school gates waiting for permission to go inside. Carl sees the scars on Billy Sundays hands and reminds the chief that he is a Navy man and there are no Oceans were he comes from only dirt farms and that no respecting Navy man makes his living driving mules. Another significant object is Mac's radio, given to Carl with a promise to do his very best, even when it gets hard. Billy Sunday breaks the radio trying to convince Carl to drop out of the Navy finals.Later, the radio fixed by Billy, and the words written 'A Son Never Forgotten' draws these two men ever closer. The men still face challenges in their lives they will have to overcome. Life will bring these men back together for a final victory proving they are 'men of honor'.
