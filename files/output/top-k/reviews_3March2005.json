But then, that's not saying much as we're talking about two of the world's most talented artists), the pacing is perfect, the plot unravels without ever a hitch or a loose end, the script is top class... but it has a quality of coldness that to me, makes so many of the Claude Chabrol films I see fall short of memorable. In its perfection, it's a heartless film. I don't mean that the story is heartless, but the execution of it. Perhaps, after all, it could have done with a few flaws, with a touch of imperfection, something which is the mark of a work of art created by human hands.

Doing badly at the Box Office and loosing out on awards due to Dances With Wolves and Goodfellas, the film has always been viewed as an inferior film in comparison to it's predecessors. Whilst perhaps more inconsistent than the original two films, it is still however an amazing story with solid acting throughout.Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) is getting old. Beginning to become burdened by the events of his life, this Godfather has plans to make his family's finances legitimate. Helped by his sister Connie (Talia Shire) and protégé Vincent Mancini (Andy Garcia), Michael begins his progression to becoming a law abiding member of society. As he begins to realise though, the more you try to leave the old life behind, the more you get dragged back in.Released so long after the previous part, this film smacks of a next generation. Old faces like Michael and Connie are grown old, some are dead (Tom Hagen a notable absentee due to an argument over Robert Duvall's fee), and all the children of the previous films are grown up. In a way however, this does aid the film drastically. With absolutely mind blowing performances by some of the elder cast (Pacino in particular is jaw dropping good), the film becomes a chance for new blood to show their skill. Some do it well (for example Andy Garcia), some do it not so well (stand up Sofia Coppola).Ultimately though, like the two films before it, the key about this film is it's script. With a story involving the Vatican and corruption, it tells an interesting story, albeit not as riveting as in the first film.Perhaps there is one key flaw with this part of the series. In The Godfather we are given two magnetic performances by Pacino and Marlon Brando. Both thrive with a plot which suits them to the ground, and they work well together. Then in the second chapter, we have Pacino and Robert De Niro. Whilst never actually meeting during the film, these two actors again put in amazing performances. However, in this final part, the only main star is Pacino. He manages to once more put in a performance of true genius, but he is very much alone in this film. He is helped by a fine cast, but it is Pacino's film and his alone.It is a confusing truth that so many people condemn The Godfather Part III. Whilst it might not have the charisma of the first part and it may focus on one genius actor rather than two, it is still a stunning film and a worthy conclusion to the series. We have witnessed the finest Trilogy to have been made so far, and it will take a very long time to be beaten.

The movie is sure sexy but that was not its big appeal to me. It is really about child-raising - handling spoiled brats, reaching them, turning them around, teaching good values. It is also about parenthood - the instincts that drive us, love for our own children. It is about marriage - the loyalty we owe our spouse, the sort of person we might marry and be happy with. It it also about education - how a child learns to read and the need to be educated. But what I found most interesting was how the big advances in relationships happened when the mother\/daughter and then the mother\/father were set free of normal behavioral constraints... this only happened when they had a fire going in the fireplace (firelight) and when time stops still and what happens never really happened. People were freed to express themselves honestly and that is when the relationships changed. Perhaps Las Vegas's new advertising theme, What Happens in Vegas Stays in Vegas, was inspired by this movie... but I don't think Las Vegas is looking for growth in human relationships! This movie is very satisfying, and it is happy... leaving the viewer upbeat about family and life.

The Aristocats and Robin Hood are familiar critical whipping boys, but perhaps the greatest flowering culmination of Disney's nouveau wretchedness is a movie that's only half-animated 1977's Pete's Dragon. It's marvelously inept entertainment &#150; one of the biggest and worst musicals you'll ever see. Sean Marshall's vocal performance is among the most limply sung and out-of-tune I've ever heard, the choreography and camera-work beats Robert Altman to the Anti-Musical by a good three years, and the songs can only be called models of awfulness. (The fact that they're also terribly hummable only aggravates the pain they cause - they're as catchy as smallpox.) Most of the adult actors seem to think they're competing in some kind of ham Olympics, with Mickey Rooney, Red Buttons, Shelley Winters, and the actress playing the schoolteacher all reaching unbelievable heights of mugging, veritably tripping over themselves for the gold. In terms of artistic construction, the concept is frankly absurd, and the narrative structure is as lumpy as a garden planted with rocks (we've long since forgotten the Gogans by the time they arrive, etc.). The animation is unconvincing, the drinking scenes unfathomable from a modern perspective, and the 128-minute running time is simply unforgivable. The movie is truly hilarious, but even I've never been able to watch it all the way through. Yes, it's *that* long.
