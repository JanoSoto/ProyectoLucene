Let me start by saying Anthony Hickox is a brilliant man. This movie was his first time as a writer and director and he did it perfectly. Going on to make a Warlock movie and a Hellraiser film, he has established himself (though still remains under-appreciated).The film stars the kid from Gremlins and his group of friends who encounter the guy from The Omen, who along with a midget and a Lurch-like butler manage a wax museum full of horrible characters. Dracula, the Marquis de Sade, a werewolf, the mummy, and nine other nasties. Well, the museum offers a portal to each of these horrible worlds -- but if you die in the portal, you die in real life and become part of the museum.This film is brilliant because of the perfect combination of horror and comedy. You will get spraying blood, mutilated flesh, and a dismembered hand that lives on its own (see Waxwork II for more on this and its connection to Evil Dead II). You will get a girl sexually aroused by being flogged (sado-masochism goes hand in hand with horror). But yet, it is funny. The midget is cute, one of the kids is just weird and you should hear the way Dracula says steak tartar or the scene where the AARP (old people) raid the place.I could complain about the really odd plot and lack of sense. I mean, there is a part where the origin of the museum is explained. Not only does this make little sense, but there is no reason the man telling the story should know anything about it. Then there is the bit about the sculptures needing relics from their real-life bodies to become alive. Yet, there are sculptures of The Fly, the Invisible Man, and a scene from a zombie film. These things never happened, so how can they have real relics? But you know what? It is so much fun, you just ignore things like this (especially compared to the complete nonsense plot of the sequel or House II...) Recommended? Heck yeah. Great comedy, great horror, great 80s film. Dana Ashbrook appears before the day of Twin Peaks. Oh, and the professor from Sliders is in it, too.My only concern is that allegedly the film was cut by the MPAA due to gore in the vampire sequence.

I don't get it really, why people give this movie so good reviews. This is pure Hollywood entertainment with great special effects and dull storyline. First of all it takes about a half an hour before the movie even gets started after the first sequence. Typical blah blah about oilworkers who have to go to save the world and main characters ex-wife which is not an ex just yet. And would you guess they will be together again in the end of the movie! You get the feeling here that after Terminator Cameron has wanted to try something else like shooting an action movie under the water. Well, it's a nice idea but the movie's story is not very interesting in the first place. The first half of the movie actually works pretty OK(after the half an hour start). Cameron mixes some scifi themes here which seems like a good idea at first but in the end of the movie it seems like a scriptwriter has got a little out of hand. It would have been nice if Cameron would have had the courage to leave something for the audience and maybe not to explain everything in the end. There is some nice mystery feeling when Lindsey first time sees the Alien and you get sucked very well in to the mood. And it actually works until the ridiculous ending where Bud Brighman is brought to the Alien's spaceship and they'll explain to him why they deciced to save the world. Movie loses it's credibility at once. Terminator works because the whole story is more like black comedy and there is some irony in it and Aliens 2 is just great action movie. Here you get the whole movie in under the seas just moving around, almost divorced couple finding each other again and kind aliens saving the world because they think that love is worth saving.

Most recently was the other night as I did a marathon of all three King Kong movies. Thismovie may have been excellent for its time, but I just don't think it has aged that well. I think the strongest part of this movie are the special effects. Stop motion, or otherwise, the man in control of the effects had a good feel for his limitations and the audiences probable toleration for those limitations, and managed them well. The weakest part of this movie is the acting. Really, this whole national fascination with Fay Wray still puzzles me. She started off OK, when she is the starving waif, rescued off the street by Robert Armstrong,and the subsequent conversation in the diner. Once she hits the ship and starts interacting with Bruce Cabot she gets shrill and only gets shriller as the movie goes on. If she's an inspiration for scream queens, the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre owes her a debt of gratitude, because thats the only screaming that's ever come close to competing (at least that I've heard). Robert Armstrong as Carl Denham is mildly interesting, but Bruce Cabot as Jack Driscoll is stiffer than dry oak. People thought this guy was romantic? For everything between good and bad, there was the script and plot, which have aged fairly well. Many people fueled on the nitrous pace of modern movies may find this a bit languid, but it still moves along reasonably. For the feature attraction, King Kong (the ape,not the movie) is a decent experiment. There is care and love put into this, it is obvious. He moves fairly smoothly, and his expressions, while occasionally goofy and doll-like, are remarkably humanistic. I've had a good time watching the movie, multiple times, and while I can't place it as a great movie,it has obviously inspired countless movies and monsters, and as such is innovative. Also, as the key word-multiple. I've seen it several times and yet to get bored with it, always a plus with any movie. Definitely worth a watch, at least once. I bought a single-disc edition, on the cheap, which I recommend if you are going to purchase it. A six on a ten point, 6.4 on a 100 point.

At its best its possibly the wittiest script ever produced from Hollywood, with Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis and the beautiful Sigourney Weaver all on top form. Bill Murray does steal the show with some of the best dialogue and one liners you will hear in a comedy. Everything about the movie is likable, the stories fun, the script and dialogue is pin sharp, the direction is spot on, the eighties special effects are top drawer and still look impressive to this day (give and take a couple of dodgy moments), the actors all give excellent performances from the A listers right down to the smallest of supporting roles. As a child the movie scared the s#*t out of me, but now watching it as an adult its just a wonderfully enjoyable timeless classic which is to be respected when you compare it to the total c#*p that comes out of Hollywood these days.

The reason I say this is because having been subjected to the fairly uninspiring Never Been Kissed, she had another teen rom-com lined up for me whilst I lay helpless in bed with a serious stomach bug. It's fair to say that this prospect didn't exactly appeal to me at first (at that point, I was willing to have lit matches under my toenails instead!) but like all movies, I felt I had to give it a chance. Besides, there wasn't much else to do and it wasn't as if a quick escape was possible either.Joseph Gordon Levitt (of 3rd Rock fame) plays Cameron, a high school student who quickly develops a crush on beautiful-but-shallow Bianca (Larisa Oleynik) but there's a snag. Bianca is not allowed to date boys until her older sister Kat (Julia Stiles) does and this is unlikely as Kat is a rebel through-and-through who is determined to remain single. So Cameron hatches a plan he pays resident school bad boy Patrick (Heath Ledger) to date Kat so he can date Bianca. All goes well initially but the course of true love rarely runs smoothly and soon, affairs of the heart overtake affairs of the wallet.Perhaps it's a tad unfair on Drew Barrymore's school-based rom-com to compare this film with Never Been Kissed but the simple truth is that this is, by far, the superior picture. It's funnier, the performances are much better and more believable and it's certainly more plausible. Levitt and Stiles lead an impressive ensemble cast with comic touches interspersed with the tragic drama that seems to exist in all American high schools. And while the story sticks doggedly to the traditional rom-com formula as well as the Shakespeare play The Taming Of The Shrew (on which it's based), it is still an entertaining movie and probably one of the best date movies I've seen for a while. This is more Clueless than anything else and that is definitely a good thing.There are, however, a couple of flaws that I feel I have to point out. Firstly, Julia Stiles makes an unlikely school geek and although she gives the role her all, she simply doesn't look like the part. And unless you're paying attention, it can be difficult trying to keep up with who is doing what to whom. I also felt that some characters weren't given enough screen time such as the girl who's a fan of Shakespeare or Bianca's friend, Chastity (Gabrielle Union). But taking this as it is, this is a surprisingly competent comedy that hits all the right buttons.

This truly unique sci-fi film remains the most disturbing movie I have seen, and it's 35 years old.The fact that this film lost Best Picture to The French Connection puzzles me and yet, at the same time, doesn't surprise me. The Academy could never reward such a daring film as this, especially a science fiction film. 35 years later, this movie would still warrant a hard R rating, if not a near NC-17. The way that Kubrick puts the violence in the film like it's no big deal is really scary and disturbing, which makes the movie marvelous.The cinematography and editing of this picture are truly mind-blowing. From the opening image of the anti-hero, Alex, staring down the camera, to the eerie ending shot, you cannot keep your eyes off of the screen. The way the film was shot remains cutting edge to this day, and you'd be amazed at how long the takes are and how mind-blowing the cinematography is. And one could never forget the sex scene, basically a motion blur, to the William Tell Overture. The use of slow-motion was also used perfectly, a breath of fresh air in a time where it is used sloppily and for no reason.The direction is like none other. The rape scenes are unflinchingly done, and the sporadic and flashy style (rendered cliché by films such as Saw) makes for some of the triipiest scenes on film. Kubrick did wonders with the camera and made for an insane trip, with a startling message of violence in our youth and the effects of a government experiment. One must watch this movie more than once to truly appreciate it.What really, really makes the film so incredible is Malcolm McDowell. His portrayal of Alex, a young delinquent who entertains himself with violence and rape, is truly one of the greatest performances on film. His nasty sneer and devilish performance is flawless. You can see the way he holds back a grin when he says he's going into jail for murder, and during the treatment scenes, his delight turning to utter shock is unforgettably real. He makes the film what it is a classic.As much as I have gushed about the movie, it is definitely not for the faint of heart. The rape scenes get very out of control, and the subject matter is incredibly disturbing.

I'm a film buff, I can and generally do find enjoyment in most films, and this is a good example. If I were voting for the screenplay, direction, acting, it would get a 3. Technically a 6, yet for the cinematography a 10. I'm not fence sitting here, as a film is generally a team effort, utilising the skills of many, and to succeed the director\/producers have to pull it all together, and pull up those lagging behind, not let them pull you under. Sadly the latter appears to be the case with In God's Hands, hence the fact I find it hard to give a single vote, due to this disparity of skill, But all will become clear, as you read on, Well although it's a few years old now, In God's Hands deserves some comment I feel. I've had it on DVD a few years, and only just got around to watching it a second time, (thanks to the random button on my DVD archive), as I probably would not have bothered otherwise.But having got through it, it does have some redeeming qualities, and a few mind blowing ones, hence this additional comment for IMDb.It is one of those films that could have been so much better, if only they had stuck to a core story line. Great surfing, huge waves, awesome locations, and some of the best cinematography you will EVER see, (but more on that shortly).Where it all goes horribly wrong, is the fact these amazing surfers, some of the best in the world, are simply NOT actors.

Lacking much of the Woo style and polish that propelled him into Hollywood, this is little more than a brainless, trigger-happy waste of a film that quickly runs out of steam and descends into farce.John Travolta and Christian Slater play a couple of US Air Force pilots on a routine training exercise over Utah. Whilst testing a stealth plane's abilities, Major Deakins (Travolta) takes the opportunity to steal two nuclear warheads that happen to be on board the plane (despite the fact it's a mere training exercise) by ejecting Captain Hale (Slater) out of the plane and crashing it near others in on the plan. It is soon left to Hale and an impossibly cute Park Ranger by the name of Terry Carmichael (Samantha Mathis)to recover the warheads and make them safe, while Travolta's evil plan begins to take shape. Not exactly rocket science but there you go.It's safe to say that this is one of the simplest action films I've ever seen, with a relatively small cast and a plot so basic that only the most moronic of viewers will struggle to keep up. Despite this, there are some truly awe-inspiring lapses of logic such as the hilarious scene where Travolta, seemingly having planned everything down to the last detail, can't find someone hidden beneath a blanket in a small boat. It almost takes your breath away how clichéd the whole thing is and without the usual stylistic tricks of action-master Woo (seen in stuff like MI 2), it feels like a cheap and nasty TV movie. Slater is probably the best of the performances alongside Delroy Lindo as an Air Force support guy but Travolta is in standard pantomime-bad-guy mode. For further examples, see rubbish like The Punisher or Swordfish but only if you wanted a laugh.It's such a shame that Woo's American career got off to such a dodgy start (this is the second US film he made, after the Van Damme film Hard Target).

This movie explores those ideas as seven college friends reunite for an unforgettable weekend.Seven friends who attended the University of Michigan in the sixties reunite for the funeral of their mutual friend, Alex (Kevin Costner, who was edited out of the film, and who only appears as body parts of the corpse). Alex has committed suicide while he and his girlfriend, Chloe (Meg Tilly) were staying with Harold (Kevin Kline) and Sarah (Glenn Close) Cooper. Harold is a successful businessman, and Sarah is a doctor. Coming in for the funeral are Sam Weber (Tom Berenger), a Hollywood actor; Michael Gold (Jeff Goldblum), a successful journalist; Nick Carlton (William Hurt), a drifter; Meg Jones, a Philadelphia DA; and Karen Bowen (JoBeth Williams), an unhappily married housewife. Once together for this sad event, the seven of them decide to spend the weekend together for an impromptu reunion. During the course of the weekend each of them confronts what has happened to their hopes, dreams, and idealism, where are today, and where they want to go. By the end, each has found something of their former selves to take with them as they go their separate ways.This is an interesting premise, and it's well executed here. You see where each person is proud of what he or she has accomplished, but also reminded by the presence of the others of what he or she dreamed of accomplishing. The gap between the two is what drives the film, and makes the self exploration real, as each person in turn opens up to their closest friends. In the end, they seem to realize that perhaps their best accomplishment has simply been their connection to each other.The acting is wonderful. The cast worked as an ensemble, so the level of acting among the performers is uniformly good. It is clear that the actors all respected and valued each other. As a result, the chemistry between them is real, and the relationships created are believable.I was a senior in college when I saw this, and at the time I wondered if I would worry about where I had been and where I was going as I aged. In the twenty-two years since graduation, I can only answer that yes, I have asked those questions, and explored those issues with those to whom I was close at the time. That's why I think this film has a certain timelessness, because it really does speak to everybody who has ever serious contemplated their life direction.

That's why I think this film has a certain timelessness, because it really does speak to everybody who has ever serious contemplated their life direction. And it's well worth taking the time to contemplate it along with those who do so in this film.

(Men share the dilemma too!).As such, Campion's modern opening is appropriate and thought-provoking, and the intensity of the performances from all the players (perhaps with the notable exception of Shelly Winters) gives it a complexity and power that clearly many writing here just don't get.Rarely will you see such powerful images and to-die-for settings. I suspect that the car-crash action movie fans who find this too slow walked into the wrong movie-theatre or rented the wrong DVD. This film is well worth seeing and the character John Malkovich plays, Gilbert Osmond, is very believable (contrary to what the Malkovich-haters have to tell us). Manipulative cruelty is at the heart of many a long-term relationship and, like DANGEROUS LIASIONS, is a game played by the ruthless and heartless on the vulnerable and weak. Again I refer to the car-chase sensation-seekers who expect their baddies to spring from comic books. Malkovich does not have to be anything other than cold and cruel, and many a woman has fallen for a 'bastard' only to realise that she has passed on better men.GIVE THIS FILM A CHANCE - and tell us if you liked it!

Other than that, the entire movie is one big mess, with a whole lot of jumping around from scene to scene. A lot of the flashbacks don't even make sense, and are extremely repetitive. The whole movie is filled with annoying inner monologue. The special effects are cheap-looking and corny. Not to mention that the whole thing is insanely long. I could not watch this movie in one sitting if I tried. The first time I saw it, it took me a good 5 tries to watch it all the way through.The characters in the film are all boring, and I was not interested in any of them. Paul Atreides, Jessica, etc. are all dull and one-dimensional. This movie is not worth watching.The good points - A decent performance by Patrick Stewart, and a few others - Amusing flashbacks and inner monologue Father!!!! The sleeper has awakened!!... Jessica.... is he the one?.... FATHER!!!!.... not one drop of rain on Arakis... No!!... the sleeper must awaken... Even the good points can't make this movie any good. If you have three hours to kill, watch it. If not, well... you are probably better off.
