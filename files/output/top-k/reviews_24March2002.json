Sure it has it's flaws, but what movie IS perfect? I thought this was a spectacular sequel. It's pretty hard to beat the original, but I thought this one came pretty close to being just as good. I agree that the scene where the little girl did gymnastics and kicked the raptor out the window was one of the stupidest things Spielberg has ever done (in fact, if you ask me, they should have completely eliminated her character from the film). Also when Eddie Carr (Richard Schiff) yells to the people hanging on the rope and they respond with a fast-food order was another low point in the film. But these sort of scenes didn't ruin the film for me. Also, while I'm thinking about it, why do so many people have a problem with the T-Rex running around San Diego? That was AWESOME! I loved it! I really don't know why people have such a problem with that.As far as story goes, I thought it was a pretty well thought out story, nothing terribly complicated, but it got the job done. I don't really know what people are expecting, I went into the theater to see some dino's and I got what I wanted (and more). I did read the book before seeing the movie, even though I knew it would be drastically different, there were a few scenes that I had wished they'd put in the film, but you can't win 'em all.I thought the characters, acting and the cast were very good. I've always liked Jeff Goldblum, and he didn't let me down here. Other people that I believe deserve mention are Julianne Moore, Pete Postlethwaite, Richard Attenborough, Vince Vaughn, Peter Stormare, Richard Schiff, Joseph Mazello and Ariana Richards (even though those last two are barely in the film, but I was happy to see their cameos).As far as computer effects go...simply AMAZING!!! I would recommend seeing this film for the effects alone. They look even better than the original film, and there are a few scenes in particular that totally made the film for me. For instance, the scene when the two T-Rex's are attacking the car with Eddie Carr (Richard Schiff) is just phenomenal!!!All-in-all, I was VERY pleased with the movie and it wasn't a let down. If you liked the first one I think you should see this one and make your own conclusion instead of reading all these reviews and letting someone else make your decision for you. I hope you like the film as much as I did. ...Oh and be sure to watch Jurassic Park 3 after seeing this film. Despite what people may say, I thought it was an excellent installment to the films.Thanks for reading,-Chris ","genre":null},{"date":"24 March 2002","score":"15 out of 32 people found the following review useful","review":" I really don't understand why so many people don't like this film.

For those of you that are confused I am talking about the major corporation that does play a pivotal role in the plot of this movie(contrary to critical and cynical belief a plot does exist).My advice towards the other reviews that you are reading too is to be wary of any extreme take on this movie. Some people gave it a 1 out of 10 and that is not realistic because they were p***ed off by something in the movie thus shredding to part the entire film with fabrications and unbelievable exaggerations that actually made me laugh.  On the other hand be wary of someone who gives it a 10 out of 10 because they might be one of those crazed, lunatic biased fans that jumps at the sound of an unexpected groan.Although I have to admit that I am a biased fan of the game and I did go into this movie extremely pumped, I also had expectations for the film to live up to.  And just being able to say that I like a film that I have expectations for, much less being sucked into says a lot. Now enough of this BS credibility stuff let me tell you about an a thriller of an action\/horror movie.  The first thing that jumps to mind when I think about Resident Evil- beginning, middle and end- is the atmosphere.  There was just something about the movies extremely fast pace, tense feeling and genuine dread that made me connect to the picture.  Granted I do have my I wish 's about the film too but like the others said, its a horror flick you let them slide and keep an open mind so that you are able to enjoy the rewarding aspects of the film, which are fresh, unexpected and plentiful.Milla makes me think that there are few things more sexy than a woman with a gun.  She is stunning throughout the picture and honestly feels like the only character developed by the way she plays her role outside of the dialogue and story development.  As Alfred Hitchcock once said (not in his exact words) a really good actor saves you 20 minutes of character development because the audience buys into the character and Milla does this.  You really get a good feel for who her character is by just watching her and she is the one person that I got attached to.  Now if we could have only gotten a little more out of the other characters in terms of story development.  I also felt that Hugh Jackman could have fit perfectly as the prisoner in this movie, but it did have a small budget.  The movie is also unique in its pace as it never slows down and you honestly cannot look away for a second for fear of missing something critical, which you might.  I have never ever seen a picture move faster.  This again adds to the atmosphere of the movie that I felt comparable to Memento or the Matrix. If you know the feel of those movies then you know what I am talking about.The action choreography is very good and better than most movies and there are even some scenes that will leave you saying awesome and glad I wasnt that zombie getting my neck snapped.  I felt that the special forces as protaginists with guns gave the movie more validity and realism, as well as staying true to the game.  Of course there are also some great sequences with the hardware which also left me impressed.  I am anticipating the DVD of this movie already because I would love to see if there is a directors cut of that gives us a little more in character development and in turn would add to the story.  The thought of this however might take away from the razor fast pace, which creates the critical and unique atmosphere that Resident Evil video gamers definitely are familiar with.  Overall I would give this movie 9 out of 10 as I am rating it based on what it is.  A movie that is well above par from your average horror flick bringing in a realistically scary storyline and solid plot that aside from a little more development and omission of a few cheesy scenes and one liners could be one of the classic horror movies of all time.  This film will not disappoint the gamers either and fans of Milla, as I am now one of them after watching this movie, will respect her performance.  She is the standout in this film. Also look for the things that make the horror picture a different type of scary movie.  Director Paul Anderson uses the element of terror to scare the sh*t out of you and that is rare in a scary movie and I find it more terrifying.

The first part of the movie smells a lot like Ransom (Mel Gibson), but the rest of the movie doesn't play out as well.  Basically, Michael Douglas is the rich guy with the hot wife (Famke Janssen) and you're used to his performance in that role by now.  I mean, who else could play a character that drives a Land Rover in Manhattan?  Sean Bean is the evil Irish thug who terrorizes Douglas's family, and you're used to Bean in that role (Patriot Games).  With the main actors so familiar with their roles, you'd think that this movie would be a slam dunk, but you'd be wrong.I'll assume here that you've seen the trailer, so you get the plot with the kidnapping and the crazy girl (Brittany Murphy, who sure grew up since Clueless).  There's really not much to talk about outside the trailer.  When I watch a movie like this, I anticipate a few twists and a lot of action to keep me on my toes, but Don't Say A Word fails to deliver.  The plot is so straightforward it may as well be a documentary.  You won't be surprised by any of the attempted plot twists, and if you are, you won't care.  I spent the entire movie questioning the actions of most of the characters, praying that I was missing something.  The screenplay skips over key pieces of information, like how Bean's crew is able to plant video cameras and microphones in strategic locations all over New York City.  Instead, the writers focus on immaterial supporting characters like Dr. Sacks (Oliver Platt) and the ineffective NYPD.  We could have done without Platt's character altogether, and the police don't really get involved in any important way.  They show up at the end to clean up the mess and load the injured into ambulances.  We see too much of Janssen's character, and Bean's gang is about 2 members too big.  The producers could have saved a good 1\/3 of this film for the deleted scenes feature on the DVD and the story wouldn't have missed a beat.There are some bright points to be made.  The movie isn't horrible, and I didn't fall asleep while watching it.  Is that a positive comment?  Anyway, Murphy and Janssen both look very good.  Murphy gets by playing the mental patient.  She could have used this role as a stepping stone to a nice little career, but something just didn't work right for me.  Douglas is solid, and he tries hard even though he can't carry the film.  Other actors might have mailed this one in a lot earlier, but he takes the role seriously and keeps this movie alive.  I rate it a 5 out of 10.

Basically, Michael Douglas is the rich guy with the hot wife (Famke Janssen) and you're used to his performance in that role by now.  I mean, who else could play a character that drives a Land Rover in Manhattan?  Sean Bean is the evil Irish thug who terrorizes Douglas's family, and you're used to Bean in that role (Patriot Games).  With the main actors so familiar with their roles, you'd think that this movie would be a slam dunk, but you'd be wrong.I'll assume here that you've seen the trailer, so you get the plot with the kidnapping and the crazy girl (Brittany Murphy, who sure grew up since Clueless).  There's really not much to talk about outside the trailer.  When I watch a movie like this, I anticipate a few twists and a lot of action to keep me on my toes, but Don't Say A Word fails to deliver.  The plot is so straightforward it may as well be a documentary.  You won't be surprised by any of the attempted plot twists, and if you are, you won't care.  I spent the entire movie questioning the actions of most of the characters, praying that I was missing something.  The screenplay skips over key pieces of information, like how Bean's crew is able to plant video cameras and microphones in strategic locations all over New York City.  Instead, the writers focus on immaterial supporting characters like Dr. Sacks (Oliver Platt) and the ineffective NYPD.  We could have done without Platt's character altogether, and the police don't really get involved in any important way.  They show up at the end to clean up the mess and load the injured into ambulances.  We see too much of Janssen's character, and Bean's gang is about 2 members too big.  The producers could have saved a good 1\/3 of this film for the deleted scenes feature on the DVD and the story wouldn't have missed a beat.There are some bright points to be made.  The movie isn't horrible, and I didn't fall asleep while watching it.  Is that a positive comment?  Anyway, Murphy and Janssen both look very good.  Murphy gets by playing the mental patient.  She could have used this role as a stepping stone to a nice little career, but something just didn't work right for me.  Douglas is solid, and he tries hard even though he can't carry the film.  Other actors might have mailed this one in a lot earlier, but he takes the role seriously and keeps this movie alive.  I rate it a 5 out of 10.

After running away from it several times, and then longing to see it, I finally got the chance last October.Sleeping Beauty happens to be one of Disney's greatest efforts. It's said that it took nearly 10 years to finish (!), but it was really worth it. The story might remind one of Snow White or Cinderella, but there's enough put into the story to make it distinguishably brilliant. The artwork holds the primary charm to Sleeping Beauty, which is much more lush than most animation projects of its time. The backgrounds couldn't look more realistic, and the character designs are the right price. I especially liked that of Princess Aurora (courtesy of Disney's 'Nine Old Men').Based on the dark atmosphere in some parts of the movie, you can tell that this was meant for more than just the little kids (something horribly mistaken about many of today's cartoons, let-alone Disney's). The villianous partakes weren't really as scary as those in Pinocchio, but still got a strong grip on the storyline.Much of the most interesting parts came from the three fairies Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather. I should go into detail, but I don't want to ruin any of the good stuff for those who haven't seen Sleeping Beauty.I'm glad I got to see Sleeping Beauty when I had the chance, and only regret that I haven't seen it sooner.

Sometimes the movie doesn't know whether it wants to be a slick suspense-thriller or a slasher flick.  It's the film's unevenness that bogs it down.  Steve Zahn is good as usual, adding some fine comic relief.  Paul Walker is still not a great actor, but he's better than he was in The Fast and the Furious (I wanted to make sure he gets banned from movies forever after that performance).  And Leelee Sobieski shows off her talent as an up-and-coming young actress, sometimes to the point where I feel she's too good for this movie!  Joyride kept my interest, with the exception of a few overlong chase sequences, but it left me wanting more.  And there were some scenes that just begged for uninintentional laughter. ********SPOILERS AHEAD**********   For example, that scene where the guys stop at the gas station.  The tall, bearded guy with long hair (stereotypical creepy scary movie villain) walks into the store, carrying a tire thumper like a baseball bat.  The guys run into the car and try to make a quick getaway.  The creepy guy gets into his truck and chases after them.  When they finally stop, the guy steps up to the window and hands Paul Walker the credit card that he dropped at the store.  What the hell was that???  You're telling me a guy finds a credit card and he's gonna be such a good samaritan that he's gonna engage himself in a high-speed chase (driving a truck, I might add) just to give this poor guy his credit card? Joyride could've been a lot worse, but it could've been a lot better.  John Dahl, who directed the callously underrated Rounders, makes great use of lighting, but his slick direction can't overshadow the goofy script.
