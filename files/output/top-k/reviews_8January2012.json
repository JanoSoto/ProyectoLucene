I was wonder struck by the whimsical direction by Wes Anderson, the genuine and heartfelt performances by Jason Schwartzman, Bill Murray, and Olivia Williams, and the bizarre yet warm screenplay written by Wes and his college companion, Owen Wilson. However, after the credits rolled and Ooh La La by the Faces (the soundtrack also won me over) slowly faded out, my perception of why the film was so emotionally compelling was unclear.I watched Rushmore for the first time during the summer between my freshman and sophomore year. It was ideal timing, as the film opens with the protagonist, Max Fischer, entering his sophomore year at the esteemed Rushmore Academy. Max is a precocious, clever, somewhat of a wunderkind fifteen year old. However, as you find out in the opening of the film after his fantasy of solving the hardest geometry equation in the world, we learn that the Rushmore Yankee isn't the brightest student at the academy. In fact, the only reason he is able to keep attending Rushmore with his failing grades is because he joins almost every club Rushmore has to offer -- and in most cases, is the president, captain, or leader of a majority of those extracurricular activities.After analyzing Max, I began to recognize why Rushmore was so effective for me, to the point that I established it as my all time favorite movie. Max is the most identifiable character in any film that I have ever encountered in any of the films I have ever seen (even though I'm young, I've seen a lot of them). Max is an outcast, a social reject. He does poorly in math, has the gusto to write, produce and direct school plays (I WROTE A HIT PLAY!!!), and is, in some measure, a compulsive liar. He is a lot like me. This has become more true as I grow older and am placed into harder math classes. He dresses unlike his classmates (sporting a blazer with a Rushmore emblem, the only one in the crowd to don one), and talks with a pompous, almost pontifical vocabulary. One of his attributes that I most related with is his apprehension about the future. I have never identified better with a film character before I witnessed the fanciful world of Max Fischer.I know this review is more of an analysis of the main character, but I would only feel guilty to give more of the plot away of this terrific gem. I think even as I grow older, even older than Max himself, I will still look up to his high self esteem and exuberance to take on the impossible. In high school, it is easy to be without these characteristics. But only after repeated viewings of Rushmore, and learning lessons from my favorite movie character of all time, Max Fischer, I feel more and more as if I am watching a film that was written about me. I secure great comfort in knowing that, in the end, I will triumph just like Max.Rating 10\/10.

But that clever move is one of the most delightful characteristics of the film. Seeing New York is monochrome, its diners, its snow-covered streets, its pavements, people going about their moribund lives, its buildings - skyscrappers and the common-man's abode, its skyline, the sunset, the city by the night and firecrackers in the dark give Woody Allen's beloved city an unearthly yet heart-warming touch. Through his initial four-minute montage backed with a witty monologue, Mr. Allen not only manages capture the beauty of New York in gorgeous B&W, but only gifts it an ode in one of the best comedies the world has seen, and that is probably the greatest gift a mortal can present a city with. Manhattan, as the title so subtly suggests, is set in the town of Manhattan, New York. Centering around Isaac (Woody Allen), a 42 year-old balding man, his predicaments - like preventing his second-now-lesbian wife from publishing a tell-all book about their marriage - and conundums - like dating a 17-year old high-schooler Tracy (Mariel Hemingway) or his best friend's mistress Mary (Diane Keaton). That is all the movie has to offer in terms of a 'solid plot line.' What the rest of the film is about how Isaac handles each of his issues. He meets Mary, who at that time is dating his married friend Yale (Michael Murphy) and forms an initial impression of hers as a 'little yo-yo' before falling in love with her. He tries talking his ex-wife into not publishing the book, who remains adamant as a brick. He asks his high- school girlfriend to move to London and to remember him as a 'fond memory,' with a Casablanca-esque touch. And in classic Woody Allen- fashion, he fails, in accomplishing almost everything. Movies by Woody Allen hardly rely on events in films to carry them through. Instead, they work on the characters, dialogues, tracking days as they fly-by without merely focusing on D-days. And that is where Manhattan derives its beauty from. Take the characters, for instance. All of them have distinct personalities - Isaac is the neurotic and highly intelligent protagonist, Mary is the beautiful and dilemma- stricken divorced woman looking for love, Tracy is the innocuous teenager who lacks the ability to distinguish infatuation from love, while Yale is the adulterer playing the balancing act on boats heading different ways. The dialogue is always the highlight of any Woody Allen film, since the man pays special attention to it, often writing the script himself. Manhattan keeps the precedent he set in Annie Hall alive. The dialogue, especially mouthed by the nebbish Isaac is sharp, witty, though often hurtful and cynical. It won't make you laugh out loud, but will make you silently smile and marvel at the intellect of the man and the delivery. It is spontaneous; seemingly impromptu, which adds to the authenticity of the delivery. Here is man whose believes that the best pick-up line in his arsenal is 'I had a mad impulse to throw you down on the lunar surface and commit interstellar perversion.' Crazy, or what? The soundtrack really strikes you as definitive in the film. In a way, with its old-school instrumentals and symphonies, topped with trumpets and violins, the soundtrack gives the movie an archaic feel, like cinema originally had. That, perhaps, is Mr. Allen's ode to the real-movies they had in old times. The cinematography, too, is breathtaking, the kind that makes you want to revel in it. The interplay between shades of black and white is gorgeous, and is naturally appealing to any movie aficionado.Manhattan is a film whose humour cannot be explained, you have to experience it yourself. It is very niche; if a bar has to be set to differentiate between people who got real jokes and ones that didn't, I would call it the Woody Allen Line. His humour surpases almost everything else I have seen in movies - not slapstick, but subtle, gentle and intellectual - the kind you either love, or don't get at all. In a world where every comedy film tries to be the canon, Manhattan remains the arrow, but the latter is always the true test of marksmanship. After his supposed magnum opus Annie Hall, Woody Allen goes ahead and tops it up with a better Manhattan. He matures and mellows as a director, not resorting to slip-on-the-banana-peel humour anymore. The film is aesthetically appealing and reeks of sheer brilliance. However, these very words remind me of another film - Annie Hall. Comparisons? Inevitable, since Manhattan looks like a closely related cousin born two years later. We'll have them another time, because that will be another chapter entirely. But I do personally believe, that Manhattan remains the genius's true opus.

","genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance"},{"date":"8 January 2012","score":"","review":" Having a psycho, or a lunatic, as the protagonist does make things a whole lot easier for a director. He\/she doesn't have to justify anything the protagonist does, because all the acts he commits, regardless of how unfeasible or irrational they are, are forgiven since he is a psychopath. The 'W' word of inquisition is tossed out of the window. For instance, in this film, Patrick Bateman hacks people to death, tries to feed a cat into an ATM machine and hides decapitated heads in his freezer, and all of these atrocities pass unquestioned, for he is, as the title proclaims, the American Psycho. Americans have really begun scaring me now. American Pie came up with some of the most outrageous sex ideas ever, American Beauty was a thoroughly unsettling experience and American Psycho is eerily disturbing. Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) is a narcissistic banker living alone in a posh New York apartment. He lives a stereotypical banker life - have a girlfriend, sleep with another, a music afiocinado and flirting with his secretary - nothing that calls specific attention to him. However, the banker is just a facade he adopts to fit into the normal world - a Dr. Jekyll to his inner My. Hyde. He has an alter-ego residing inside him, one that has only two emotions - greed and and disgust - and wants to kill people in the most remorseless and sadistic ways imaginable, because that is his definition of catharsis. Patrick Bateman isn't merely misanthropic, he is quite literally the epitome of cruelty. He is a the kind of person who watches The Texas Chainsaw Massacres while exercising, and for whom the hardest conundrum in life is whether he wants to get his next victim with a nail-gun or a chainsaw. The character of a straight-faced murderer is not just disturbing, but also funny, in a morbid way. Despite having a dark and uncanny atmosphere, the ironies and the obvious pleasure that Bateman gets from heinously murdering hobos, peers, hookers and even random pedestrians with utter indifference makes you cringe and smile at the same time. Every time an axe hacks into his co-worker's flesh with a dull thud as Hip To Be Square plays in the background, you can't help but guiltily laugh to yourself. The murders follow a well established and contemplated about modus operandi and have an aftermath too. Bateman doesn't just kill people. He premeditates the commission, derives ecstasy during the act, and then sits back and relaxes, smoking a cigar, while admiring his handiwork. Bale carries the role of this two-faced beast with perfection. His poker-face maintains the facade, but his frigid gaze gives away the rather inconvenient and a whole lot frightening truth. What is interesting, is that the film maintains a light-air through the gruesome occurings, like a reflection of the protagonist himself. It talks about visiting cards, about the plethora of cosmetics Patrick uses, often to the sound of a piano cortet or otherwise ebullient music in the background. Even Patrick's apartment is refreshing with clean, white walls, which is an amusing dichotomy with Patrick himself. Not everything is froody with the film. A character like Patrick Bateman could have become a modern-day icon, if only he had more deeper and an insight had been presented into his psyche. His murders, his vicious idiosyncrasies all seem superficial, making the viewers wonder who he really is, or what made him this way. Between masquerading as a lackadaisical banker and a rabid psychopath, he never really offers an explanation to why he is the man he is. Childhood trauma, car accident, sexual harassment - nothing. Another disappointing is that the movie introduces too many people without offering a satisfactory ending to all. There is a detective who just doesn't appear in the last thirty minutes, people whose purpose is only to stand by the side of the normal Patrick, a mistress who purpose on screen remains mysterious and even a girlfriend who seems to have been tossed into this mayhem for no reason whatsoever. These, however, are trivial things in the bigger scale of things. The movie has an ambiguous ending, and this by far, is my favourite part of the film. It lets you choose your own path to reach a satisfying conclusion, but there's one, and the most likely, that asks a really provoking question - who really is more beastly, Patrick or the world? After Patrick commits his crimes, the world and its people try to bury them. Towards the ending, Patrick wanders into his peers apartment where he has stashed away many of the bodies, to find it clean and painted sparkly white, as if nothing ever happened there. The landlady creeps up to him for behind and asks him to leave and to never return, which if pondered upon, is a ghastly and horrifying concept.

Every time an axe hacks into his co-worker's flesh with a dull thud as Hip To Be Square plays in the background, you can't help but guiltily laugh to yourself. The murders follow a well established and contemplated about modus operandi and have an aftermath too. Bateman doesn't just kill people. He premeditates the commission, derives ecstasy during the act, and then sits back and relaxes, smoking a cigar, while admiring his handiwork. Bale carries the role of this two-faced beast with perfection. His poker-face maintains the facade, but his frigid gaze gives away the rather inconvenient and a whole lot frightening truth. What is interesting, is that the film maintains a light-air through the gruesome occurings, like a reflection of the protagonist himself. It talks about visiting cards, about the plethora of cosmetics Patrick uses, often to the sound of a piano cortet or otherwise ebullient music in the background. Even Patrick's apartment is refreshing with clean, white walls, which is an amusing dichotomy with Patrick himself. Not everything is froody with the film. A character like Patrick Bateman could have become a modern-day icon, if only he had more deeper and an insight had been presented into his psyche. His murders, his vicious idiosyncrasies all seem superficial, making the viewers wonder who he really is, or what made him this way. Between masquerading as a lackadaisical banker and a rabid psychopath, he never really offers an explanation to why he is the man he is. Childhood trauma, car accident, sexual harassment - nothing. Another disappointing is that the movie introduces too many people without offering a satisfactory ending to all. There is a detective who just doesn't appear in the last thirty minutes, people whose purpose is only to stand by the side of the normal Patrick, a mistress who purpose on screen remains mysterious and even a girlfriend who seems to have been tossed into this mayhem for no reason whatsoever. These, however, are trivial things in the bigger scale of things. The movie has an ambiguous ending, and this by far, is my favourite part of the film. It lets you choose your own path to reach a satisfying conclusion, but there's one, and the most likely, that asks a really provoking question - who really is more beastly, Patrick or the world? After Patrick commits his crimes, the world and its people try to bury them. Towards the ending, Patrick wanders into his peers apartment where he has stashed away many of the bodies, to find it clean and painted sparkly white, as if nothing ever happened there. The landlady creeps up to him for behind and asks him to leave and to never return, which if pondered upon, is a ghastly and horrifying concept. ","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"8 January 2012","score":"","review":" Having a psycho, or a lunatic, as the protagonist does make things a whole lot easier for a director. He\/she doesn't have to justify anything the protagonist does, because all the acts he commits, regardless of how unfeasible or irrational they are, are forgiven since he is a psychopath. The 'W' word of inquisition is tossed out of the window. For instance, in this film, Patrick Bateman hacks people to death, tries to feed a cat into an ATM machine and hides decapitated heads in his freezer, and all of these atrocities pass unquestioned, for he is, as the title proclaims, the American Psycho. Americans have really begun scaring me now. American Pie came up with some of the most outrageous sex ideas ever, American Beauty was a thoroughly unsettling experience and American Psycho is eerily disturbing. Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) is a narcissistic banker living alone in a posh New York apartment. He lives a stereotypical banker life - have a girlfriend, sleep with another, a music afiocinado and flirting with his secretary - nothing that calls specific attention to him. However, the banker is just a facade he adopts to fit into the normal world - a Dr. Jekyll to his inner My. Hyde. He has an alter-ego residing inside him, one that has only two emotions - greed and and disgust - and wants to kill people in the most remorseless and sadistic ways imaginable, because that is his definition of catharsis. Patrick Bateman isn't merely misanthropic, he is quite literally the epitome of cruelty. He is a the kind of person who watches The Texas Chainsaw Massacres while exercising, and for whom the hardest conundrum in life is whether he wants to get his next victim with a nail-gun or a chainsaw. The character of a straight-faced murderer is not just disturbing, but also funny, in a morbid way. Despite having a dark and uncanny atmosphere, the ironies and the obvious pleasure that Bateman gets from heinously murdering hobos, peers, hookers and even random pedestrians with utter indifference makes you cringe and smile at the same time.

","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"8 January 2012","score":"2 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":" A criminal burglarizes the home of a wealthy opera singer in London, looking for a set of expensive jewels. During the burglary he murders the opera singer but when the singer's nine year old niece interrupts the crime, the criminal flees after failing to discover where the jewels are hidden in the home. This is essentially the opening of the old Hollywood chestnut, 'Gaslight', starring Hollywood icon, Ingrid Bergman, as Paula Alquist Anton, the protagonist of this rather slow-moving, dated 'mystery-thriller'.Following the murder, little Paula is sent to Italy where she studies to become an opera singer like her aunt. Now as an adult, her music teacher becomes exasperated with her as her mind is never on her music studies and she can never give up obsessing about the murder of her aunt. She ends up returning to the old house in London where her aunt met her demise after meeting Gregory Anton (played by another Hollywood icon, Charles Boyer) who is her piano accompanist during her opera lessons and an aspiring composer. All the courtship scenes between Paula and Gregory set in Italy serve as unnecessary exposition and it takes quite a bit of time before we get to the meat and potatoes of the story Gregory's attempt to gain control of Paula's home by convincing her that she's losing her mind.Later on in the film, we learn that Gregory gains access to the attic, where Paula (at Gregory's behest) has placed all of her aunt's belongings. Gregory gains access by entering an domiciled home, two houses down the block, then climbing onto the roof and through a skylight into the attic. The question arises why he never entered the home to look for the jewels years before Paula had reached the age to enter into marriage. It's posited that since the jewels would have been so easily recognized as stolen, Gregory would have been unsuccessful in fencing them, so the only way he could take possession, was by having his wife committed and legally being declared the new and complete owner of her estate.Unfortunately, once Paula discovers the letter from 'Sergius Bauer' addressed to his aunt, coupled with Gregory's angry outburst, it becomes pretty clear that Bauer and Gregory Anton are the same person. Act Two involves one repetitious scene after another of Gregory attempting to drive Paula batty by making her believe that she's either hallucinating or stealing items from him or the home. It all begins with the brooch Gregory gives Paula, which she loses at the Tower of London. Soon afterward, a picture is no longer in the frame on the wall and again Gregory blames Paula for taking it. When Paula finally finds the picture behind a table, Gregory accuses her of having put it there (when it's obvious that Gregory has been hiding all the objects all along).More of Gregory's tired machinations are trotted out before the climax. That includes the footsteps Paula hears up in the attic (that's actually Gregory rummaging upstairs trying to find the aunt's jewels) and the gaslights dimming up and down, with Gregory once again, at the controls. The 'last straw' is when Paula finally insists on getting out of her cloistered existence by accepting a socialite's invitation to a party. There, Gregory pulls another one of his 'hide and seek' routines, pretending his watch has been stolen and now finding it in Paula's purse. Clueless Paula, who is not only besotted with bad boy Gregory to begin with, and is also fragile due to the tragic circumstances of her childhood, is unable to trust herself, despite knowing deep down that Gregory's accusations are untrue.With little suspense for a good chunk of the film, we at least get to enjoy the antagonist's comeuppance at the hands of the solid as a rock Scotland Yard Inspector, Brian Cameron (played by solid as a rock 'Yankee' actor, Joseph Cotton). He's been trailing Gregory all along and with the help of a cop on the beat along with the Anton's servants, manages to subdue the villain, tying him up in the attic (one wonders why Director Cukor chose not to show the fight between Cameron and Anton, up in the attic).While Ingrid Bergman does take on a role that would NOT make any feminist proud throughout most of the film, the film's scenarists throw the woman's movement a bone by finally having Paula give Gregory his due&#x97;she pretends she's insane, unable to 'recall' where the knife is, which Gregory could use to set himself free.'Gaslight' is based on a stage play that's rooted in an earlier time. It's poorly written but features some nifty 'noirish' cinematography and excellent over the top acting from the principals along with Angela Lansbury in her first screen role. Lansbury plays one of the servants, a sassy working-class gal who adds to the protagonist's paranoia at every turn. It's an excellent performance but one wonders how Lansbury could have been nominated for best supporting actress at the Oscars, since her on screen time is extremely limited.

Naturally, North is fed up with it and decides to legally leave them and travel all across the world to find new parents, constantly watched over by his guardian angel (Bruce Willis) resulting in hilarious situations.

I had great hopes for this film, which we saw at a New Year's eve showing at the excellent Dryden Theatre at George Eastman House in Rochester. I'm sorry to report that the film didn't work for me at any level.William Powell and Myrna Loy play Nick and Nora Charles. He's a former detective, she's an heiress. They are rich, glamorous, and very, very sophisticated. Powell and Loy were wildly popular in these roles, and reprised them again and again. Powell more or less looks the part, but I think Loy was miscast. She looks and acts like one of the bright, snappy, working-class women in a screwball comedy. She doesn't look or act like an heiress. A second problem I had with the film was the unending focus on alcohol consumption. Getting and being drunk was far more acceptable in society then than it is now. Even so, the film really wasn't about mystery or romance--it was about drinking. People are endlessly talking about drinking, or they're drinking, or they're holding icepacks to their heads on the morning after. Powell acts half-drunk for most of the film.

Van Dyke. This picture has an extremely high IMDb weighted average of 8.1. I had great hopes for this film, which we saw at a New Year's eve showing at the excellent Dryden Theatre at George Eastman House in Rochester. I'm sorry to report that the film didn't work for me at any level.William Powell and Myrna Loy play Nick and Nora Charles. He's a former detective, she's an heiress. They are rich, glamorous, and very, very sophisticated. Powell and Loy were wildly popular in these roles, and reprised them again and again. Powell more or less looks the part, but I think Loy was miscast. She looks and acts like one of the bright, snappy, working-class women in a screwball comedy. She doesn't look or act like an heiress. A second problem I had with the film was the unending focus on alcohol consumption. Getting and being drunk was far more acceptable in society then than it is now. Even so, the film really wasn't about mystery or romance--it was about drinking. People are endlessly talking about drinking, or they're drinking, or they're holding icepacks to their heads on the morning after. Powell acts half-drunk for most of the film. (For the rest of the film he acts drunk.) I just don't find that entertaining. For me, the highlight of the evening happened before the film. The Eastman House volunteer who presented the film came dressed in a long, slinky, 1930's-style gown. She gave a witty, intelligent talk. This woman had the physical and mental attributes that would have made her a perfect Nora Charles. It's too bad that her role ended when the lights in the theater dimmed.P.S. I rarely post negative reviews of films that other IMDb reviewers have liked. That's not because I'm timid, but rather because if others liked them, I usually like them too. However, on the rare occasion when I've criticized a popular film, I've been sent some abusive personal comments. If you disagree with me, I'm happy to have you tell me so.

If however, you are entertained by the prototypical stereotype of the romantic films of the modern times, with a nice guy courting the girl of the bad boy story, go for! We enter a cubicle type work place with a hierarchy. There is the protagonist, who is a spineless, reactive and wussy nice guy, manipulated by everyone. He falls in love with the naive, goodhearted girl living in the la-la land and working in the elevator - the female lead.Tolerating everything, submitting to every demand and being used by his co-workers for his apartment, he stumbles upon two musical tickets his boss gifts to him... in exchange for the keys to the apartment, where he plans to bring the elevator girl, who the boss himself is in lust with and who he happens to be screwing for a while. So the male protagonist hands his balls over to the elevator girl, while convinces her to see the musical. Naturally, she flakes and while he patiently waits outside for her, she is with his boss at his place.While still in lust with the bad boy, the nice guy keeps chasing and chasing while the boss continues to manipulates both of them. Naturally, by being very very very nice (as in having weak personal boundaries, low self esteem and the disease to please) he keeps convincing the girl to like him. The female lead gets emotional, neurotic and suicidal after realizing that the bad boy has no intention to leave his wife. After saving her, the obligatory Why can't I fall in love with a nice guy like you follows. After showing some character and hesitantly standing up for his values or lack thereof the boy gets the girl, because she deserves better.While it is a very nice (emphasis on nice) story on the so repeated male dichotomy, it does provide a few occasional but unintended laughs.

With the all-star cast, the terrific story and some masterful direction there's no question that this here deserves its high reputation and there's also no doubt that it's one of the greatest adventure films ever made. I think a lot of the credit must go to director John Sturges and I say this because even though the movie runs 170-minutes it actually feels like just a few minutes. It's rather amazing to see how short this movie actually feel and one of the things that I loved the most is how Sturges manages to keep the film moving at such a fast pace that you can't help but forget you're watching a movie. It almost feels as if you're actually there among these men and the way Sturges tells the story is much like a composer would come up with a score. There's just a certainly poetic flow to the movie that it really feels unlike anything else that I can think of. Of course, it doesn't hurt when you have a cast that includes excellent work from Steve McQueen, Charles Bronson, James Garner, Richard Attenborough, Donald Pleasence and James Coburn just to name a few. This is one of those films where every actor perfectly fits their part and this goes from the top to those with just a few lines in the picture. Another major plus is the way the director manages to build the suspense once the escape and the aftermath happens. Most people forget but after the escape we still have an hour worth of film left and many times directors would let the suspense fall after the big event but that doesn't happen here. The music score by Elmer Bernstein is among one of the greatest and most recognizable that you're ever going to hear and the cinematography from Daniel L. Fapp is equally impressive. THE GREAT ESCAPE is the type of movie that I'd say is timeless because it's subject matter is just something that's never going to die or get old.

Mayor Larry Vaughn is welcoming developer Len Peterson and his new resort to Amity. Two scuba divers are exploring the area where the Orca sank after police chief Martin Brody killed a huge shark four years ago. A shark shows up and kills the two divers, but not before one of the divers takes a close-up picture of the shark's eye, and sometime later, while a mother is driving a boat that's pulling her water-skiing teenage daughter, the shark kills the daughter and causes the mother to accidentally blow up the boat, then a killer whale is found on the shore with a huge bite on it. After Brody sees this, he knows there's another huge great white shark in Amity's waters, but Vaughn and Peterson explain these attacks away as non-shark accidents, because the thought of another shark in Amity's waters would drive tourists away from the new resort and cause the new resort to lose money. It looks like Vaughn is still a mayor who puts money ahead of people's lives. Brody tips his gun's hollow point bullets with cyanide and melted candle wax and tells his sons Michael and Sean to stay away from the beaches and tells them to not go sailing with Mike's friends, who include Vaughn's son Larry Vaughn Jr. Everyone thinks Brody's fears are shark trauma-induced paranoia. Brody even tries to call his friend Matt Hooper, who is doing research on a boat in the Antarctic Circle, and Matt will be in the Antarctic Circle for a few more months.While keeping an eye on the waters from the beach's shark tower, Brody sees a huge dark spot in the water and rings the tower's alarm bell, but it turns out to be a school of bluefish. Vaughn fires Brody for causing this panic at the beach and scaring tourists and their money away, and even though they were told not to, Michael and Sean go out sailing with Junior Vaughn and their friends, unaware that the shark is trailing them. Brody knows it's up to him to find them before the shark kills too many of them.It's touching when the moment he returns to his family, he decides to go back to his old life, no matter the risks (which aren't few). The story has a happy ending.Overall, it's an enjoyable movie although a little sappy at times. Despite its faults, it gives a feeling of nostalgia.

It's just a shame that the script wasn't polished up a little, as the ending should have been sorted out.The cast are great and nauseatingly beautiful, and the idea of an urban legend killer has to be up there with Ghostface, It's just the killers rant at the end of the film is so poor, it taints the rest of the film.It's not the performers fault, they are really good, the lines they spout are just too cringe inducing.With references to other films, not just horror, Urban Legend is one of those films you can watch, and then come across it a few years later and forgot who got killed and how.It's a guilty pleasure, good to look at, with some great editing, but the writers should have left out the speech and the fact that a lot of characters spend a lot of time running in the rain.

It stars Meryl Streep, Leonardo DiCaprio, Diane Keaton, Robert De Niro, Hume Cronyn, Gwen Verdon, Hal Scardino and Dan Hedaya. Bessie has lived in Florida for the past 20 years, where she's been caring for her chronically ill father Marvin and her Aunt Ruth, who does not seem well acquainted with reality. While Bessie's life has not been easy, she feels that it's rewarding in its way, and she's come to love her father very much. However, when Bessie is diagnosed with cancer, she's told that the only treatment likely to save her would be a bone marrow transplant from a close relative -- which leads Bessie to contact her sister Lee for the first time since their father fell ill. Bessie and Lee have a number of issues with each other that they've never resolved, many concerning their responses to Marvin's illness as Bessie rushed to his side, while Lee preferred to stay away, and Lee's own life has been difficult. She's gotten herself out of a bad marriage, has only recently started supporting herself as a beautician, and has to raise two kids on her own. Ten-year-old Charlie tries to simply ignore the chaos going on all round him, while Hank, a troubled 17-year-old, was recently institutionalized after burning down the family's home. As the straight-laced Bessie and the earthy Lee reestablish contact after two decades, they discover just how much emotional ground they have to cover before they can meet on common ground. Based on a play by Scott McPherson's who died of AIDS, it's impossible to watch the well-acted film particularly Diane Keaton, who got an Oscar nomination,as she was given a rare opportunity here to remind us that she's not simply a fine comedienne, and she's marvelous.Meryl Streep, Robert De Niro, Leonardo DiCaprio, Hume Cronyn and Gwen Verdon add to the greatness of the cast's brilliance and excellent performance.And most of all,it provides great themes about the various approaches to love; the strength of family bonds in times of death, aging parents, reconciliation; and the healing power of selfless love.It was one good movie inspite of being dull and slow at times.A can't miss movie.

There was also a jersey number conflict when Barry Bonds joined the team. He always wore number 24, but the Giants had retired that number; it having belonged to hall of famer Willie Mays. Mays, Barry's godfather, gave Bonds permission to use it, but Barry refused and switched to his dad, Bobby Bonds' old number, 25. The movie was ultimately spoiled by huge suspensions in belief. The mutual dislike between Rayburn an Primo mirrored the real-life mutual dislike between MVP's Barry Bonds and Jeff Kent. But the pettiness involved here made the players seem like spoiled children. The part where DeNiro's character managed to coax Rayburn's son into the Hummer and drive off was never explained. Why Rayburn never immediately notified the police and an APB called to find such a conspicuous vehicle is incredulous. The fact that DeNiro was able to kill an umpire and switch places with him during the course of a rain-delayed game, was never explained. It just popped up as if in a Bugs Bunny cartoon. The game resumed and Rayburn attempted an inside the park HR during a torrential downpour that rivaled any monsoon in India. No way the game would have resumed in such conditions.

It attempts to explain the mystery of the Man in the Iron Mask, using a plot most similar to the 1939 film.Years have passed since the Three Musketeers, Aramis,Athos, and Porthos fought together with their friend D'Artagnan. The arrogant, tyrannical King Louis XIV desires the beautiful Christine, so he orders her suitor Raoul, the son of Athos, off to face death at the front. He also sends Aramis to kill the leader of a Jesuit rebellion. Louis is unaware that his loyal protector and informant, D'Artagnan, is the secret lover of his mother, Queen Anne. Louis' younger twin brother, Philippe is the man in the iron mask,imprisoned for the past six years. Arthos and Porthos plan to free Philippe, abduct Louis and replace him by putting Philippe on the throne.The four Musketeers and Philippe then charge at Louis's front line. The soldiers are so amazed by their magnificent valor that they close their eyes before firing their muskets. The smoke clears to reveal the five men still standing; all the shots, barring a few flesh wounds, missed.An enraged Louis lunges toward Philippe and tries to stab him. However, D'Artagnan jumps between them and is fatally wounded. Philippe knocks Louis down and begins to strangle him, but D'Artagnan, with his dying breaths, reminds Philippe that Louis is his brother. Philippe embraces his father for the first and last time as he dies, commenting that D'Artagnan was the one wearing the mask all along. D'Artagnan's right-hand man, Lieutenant Andre, furious at Louis for killing D'Artagnan, orders his men to leave and swears them to secrecy. By the time another battalion breaks in via another door, the three Musketeers and Lieutenant Andre have made Louis and Philippe swap clothes and locked Louis in the iron mask. Philippe introduces Athos, Porthos and Aramis as his royal council and truest friends. Posing as the King, Philippe orders the guards to take Louis and lock him away. Philippe, Athos, Porthos, Aramis and Queen Anne attend D'Artagnan's funeral, in which the three Musketeers are finally redeemed. After the funeral, Philippe asks Athos to love him like a son and Athos accepts and kisses Philippe's chest. With Louis whom Philippe, for the sake of their blood relation, granted a royal pardon now living in a house in the country, France is at peace under Philippe's rule.The only thing that the movie features is Leonardo DiCaprio in dual roles.Nothing more.I also think that he was some sort of miscast since though a talented actor, DiCaprio is no Errol Flynn. With his choirboy face and chess-club physique, he is scarcely fit to play swashbuckling hero or villain.Overall,it was a poor remake of a frequently told Dumas classic.
