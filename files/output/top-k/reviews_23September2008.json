The fact of the matter was that my sister was 6 years old and scared easily, so my father wouldn't take her. So, my father went on his own to see them. I did, however get to see Return of the King in theaters. I was entranced. I was 12 years old at the time, and I didn't understand the story. But I was captivated. When Pippin sang his song, I was in tears. At the very end, I was sobbing. The sense of beauty it had...I couldn't even describe it. So, I watched the first two movies respectively with my father. And now I was within Middle-Earth. I read the books the same month that I saw all three films. Simultaneously, in fact. That is my admiration story.What can I say about this movie that won't fill a novel? Where do I start? I suppose with Peter Jackson. I was so struck to learn how these beautiful works of art, Tolkien's magnum opus, inspired him to want to take on such a daunting yet gratifying task. He saw more in those books than I had read from them, and I'm glad that a dedicated fan brought these jewels to screen. Thank you, Mr. Jackson! The cast? Absolutely beautiful. Their friendship is so apparent, so close, not faked as you see in many other movies. Not one actor in those three films were bad. Yes, you heard me. So those of you who said that the casting was terrible, let me say to you Not all those who wander are lost.Elijah Wood, who is a very gifted and bright young man, has such an incredible beauty (inside and out) to portray such a conflicted and fatalistic character. His own striking idealism, innocence, and understanding was such that you fell in love with Frodo at first sight, but not to the point where he seemed weak. Elijah is Frodo incarnate, and anyone else would have ruined the role.Sean Astin, another very bright young man, shows his warm wisdom as Samwise, as well as a courage the likes of which I have never seen before in any performance. He had such an aura of honesty and kindliness that it shone like a light on screen. His friendship with Frodo (Elijah respectively) is so obvious and true on-screen, and not a sappy, cheesy Hollywood special. Friendships that are too sappy (and fake) will kill a movie, but this one was so obviously real and strong that it touched we fans in such a deep way (for those who could appreciate it).I can't say everything I would like to about these movies. The marriage of deep friendship, dedication, and beautiful, realistic special effects creates an entrancing epic that will be hard to rival by any movie. Those who negatively rated these movies, did you actually pay any attention to the screen as you watched the movie? For those who have never seen these movies, please, do. The deep bonds shared by these actors, all of them, are so beautifully shown, and the cast clearly underwent a lot of stress (For those who own the Extended Versions of these movies, you might hear some horror stories from Astin, Wood, Mortensen, Serkis, and more, if you listen to the documentaries\/commentaries), but it is clear that they love their roles, and it shines through in their voices, their faces, and especially their acting.I neglected to mention the efforts of the crew. Without them, over 5,000 people strong, these movies would not have been possible. They created Middle Earth in such way that it seemed possible to be a shadow of our past a past world on Earth that faded away long before our time. Thanks be to them.Yes, there are differences from the books. There always are, in any adaptation. I saw that some people commented about how weak a character they thought Frodo seemed compared to the book, because several moments in which he looks Evil in the face were shortened\/changed in the film version. That isn't true. Not at all. True heroism means not only defending others, but accepting aid from others. True heroism means that one accepts that they can't do everything alone, and accepts the aid of those willing to give it. THAT is true heroism.

","genre":"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"},{"date":"23 September 2008","score":"9 out of 16 people found the following review useful","review":" Watching the films of Alfred Hitchcock reminds one of the fairy tale of Goldilocks And The Three Bears. Not so much in the actual filmic nature of the art, but in the critical reception accorded the films. As example, some of the films that are labeled masterpieces, like Psycho or The Birds, are just right in their assessment. Other films that are critically neglected are, in fact, among Hitchcock's better films, such as Rope and Frenzy. Then there are the films that are hailed as masterpieces, but which are profound disappointments. If they are not outright bad films, they certainly are only marginally solid films, and achieve their solidity mainly through technical accomplishments. In this category I would place Rear Window and Vertigo.It's not that Vertigo is an awful film, for technically it's very well made- especially considering that era, but the flaccid and absurd screenplay simply does not hold up a half century on. Add to that the fact that the film is glacially paced, and you have a fairly boring film; one that even Jimmy Stewart's crotchety presence can barely enliven. However, I have long lauded films that do not place plot ahead of character development, so one might ask why am I asking for a better plot and more briskly paced film? Well, simply put, all of the characters are cardboard cutouts, and plot details are easier to resolve than character depth. If one is going to give mere archetypes (and that's being generous, the characters are really more stereotypes than archetypes) then the plot better zing and have a good payoff. This one does not. Part of the problem with the screenplay is the utter dependence for the propulsion of the plot upon the Neolithic psychiatric pseudoscience of the era, which too many of Hitchcock's films are dependent upon, and which leave most of his films in very shallow waters intellectually. This lack of intellectual and emotional depth is part of the reason he is rightly looked down upon when compared to greater masters of film, such as Stanley Kubrick, Orson Welles, Federico Fellini, Werner Herzog, Ingmar Bergman, or Martin Scorsese.A film like this points out the fact that Hitchcock not only was not a 'deep' director, but could not have been, for by sacrificing what he did best- manipulation, suspense, and twists of plot, all he did was sacrifice what he did best. He had no Bergmanian depths to plumb. Is it really believable that Scotty would become a deaf-mute for a year over his supposed guilt in 'Madeline's' suicide? Stewart projects far too much sanity in this role, and as a filmic persona. When Midge is fussing over him he does not look remotely catatonic, merely sleepy. There were plenty of other downright bad moments in the film, of course, such as where Scottie is standing on a chair, looks out Midge's window, and faints gently into her arms. Now, he dwarfs her in size, and falling from several feet, he would not waft into her arms, but thud, and probably hurt both of them. This scene is set up only to show that Midge will always be there for Scottie, despite whatever convolutions their relationship has had. But, we get this from every moment they are together. There are many, many other screenplay moments that fail, and this surprises, for the co-screenwriters, Samuel Taylor and Alec Coppel, based the film upon the novel D'Entre Les Morts, by Pierre Boileau and Thomas Narcejac, who also wrote the story for Henri-Georges Clouzot's great thriller Diabolique, a tale that Hitchcock tried to get the rights to, but failed. Given Diabolique's greatness one can only assume that the screnwriters, in concert with Hitchcock, ruined what was probably a great story.If the script and direction is weak, however, the best parts of the film are the score, provided by Bernard Herrmann, and the camera work. The music directs the viewer, but does not lead nor overwhelm, save for the trite and sappy love scenes, which are bad all around. Even better than the film's soundtrack is the cinematography by Hitchcock's long time cinematographer Robert Burks.

Not so much in the actual filmic nature of the art, but in the critical reception accorded the films. As example, some of the films that are labeled masterpieces, like Psycho or The Birds, are just right in their assessment. Other films that are critically neglected are, in fact, among Hitchcock's better films, such as Rope and Frenzy. Then there are the films that are hailed as masterpieces, but which are profound disappointments. If they are not outright bad films, they certainly are only marginally solid films, and achieve their solidity mainly through technical accomplishments. In this category I would place Rear Window and Vertigo.It's not that Vertigo is an awful film, for technically it's very well made- especially considering that era, but the flaccid and absurd screenplay simply does not hold up a half century on. Add to that the fact that the film is glacially paced, and you have a fairly boring film; one that even Jimmy Stewart's crotchety presence can barely enliven. However, I have long lauded films that do not place plot ahead of character development, so one might ask why am I asking for a better plot and more briskly paced film? Well, simply put, all of the characters are cardboard cutouts, and plot details are easier to resolve than character depth. If one is going to give mere archetypes (and that's being generous, the characters are really more stereotypes than archetypes) then the plot better zing and have a good payoff. This one does not. Part of the problem with the screenplay is the utter dependence for the propulsion of the plot upon the Neolithic psychiatric pseudoscience of the era, which too many of Hitchcock's films are dependent upon, and which leave most of his films in very shallow waters intellectually. This lack of intellectual and emotional depth is part of the reason he is rightly looked down upon when compared to greater masters of film, such as Stanley Kubrick, Orson Welles, Federico Fellini, Werner Herzog, Ingmar Bergman, or Martin Scorsese.A film like this points out the fact that Hitchcock not only was not a 'deep' director, but could not have been, for by sacrificing what he did best- manipulation, suspense, and twists of plot, all he did was sacrifice what he did best. He had no Bergmanian depths to plumb. Is it really believable that Scotty would become a deaf-mute for a year over his supposed guilt in 'Madeline's' suicide? Stewart projects far too much sanity in this role, and as a filmic persona. When Midge is fussing over him he does not look remotely catatonic, merely sleepy. There were plenty of other downright bad moments in the film, of course, such as where Scottie is standing on a chair, looks out Midge's window, and faints gently into her arms. Now, he dwarfs her in size, and falling from several feet, he would not waft into her arms, but thud, and probably hurt both of them. This scene is set up only to show that Midge will always be there for Scottie, despite whatever convolutions their relationship has had. But, we get this from every moment they are together. There are many, many other screenplay moments that fail, and this surprises, for the co-screenwriters, Samuel Taylor and Alec Coppel, based the film upon the novel D'Entre Les Morts, by Pierre Boileau and Thomas Narcejac, who also wrote the story for Henri-Georges Clouzot's great thriller Diabolique, a tale that Hitchcock tried to get the rights to, but failed. Given Diabolique's greatness one can only assume that the screnwriters, in concert with Hitchcock, ruined what was probably a great story.If the script and direction is weak, however, the best parts of the film are the score, provided by Bernard Herrmann, and the camera work. The music directs the viewer, but does not lead nor overwhelm, save for the trite and sappy love scenes, which are bad all around. Even better than the film's soundtrack is the cinematography by Hitchcock's long time cinematographer Robert Burks.

To me, he was the highlight of this gangster movie. He played a bad guy but one the viewer could sympathize with, and sad to say - that's just plain wrong. Lefty murdered something like 26 people, and brags about it several times in the film......and we're supposed to feel sorry for him? Well,Pacino is so good actor, he pulls it off, Johnny Depp, meanwhile, was okay but I just never felt he was right for this part. He's a great actor, and maybe I'm just used to him playing strange roles instead of an undercover cop. In other words, his character wasn't convincing to me. Having said that. however, I thought he and Pacino's characters played off each other very well. The relationship between the two was outstanding to watch develop. It also contributed largely to the depressing ending as Lefty finds out Donnie's true identity.This is frightening film for several reasons, mainly the tension of seeing if undercover agent Donnie Brasco\/Joe Pistone will succeed or be brutally exposed and killed by a ruthless band of gangsters, led by the ultra-violent Johnny Black. Michael Madsen plays the latter. Is there an actor who plays so many brutal characters, effectively, as Madsen? The story is shocking in parts for its violence (i.e. the Asian restaurant scene) and is extremely profane throughout, so be warned if that is an issue with you.This is not a film that will leave a good taste with you, especially with the downer of an ending.....but, hey, that's life. It's also about 15 minutes too long. We had the stereotypical cop-marriage woes soap opera parts, too, which could have been eliminated. Also, the character of the head FBI guy Mr. Pistone dealt with was ludicrous.

They swagger from beginning to end the practice of a drum-tight murder scheme with dangerous figures of speech and chilly flirting, but they never give the certain impression that they actually care about one another to any particular degree, neither do they evoke such a concrete desire for the insurance money.Wilder dug out the rapport between MacMurray and Robinson. To give a sample of the plot is easy, but it is better to see this film without reading too much about it, because really it is the shade that makes it enticing. A crafty scheme. Though why? Stanwyck certainly has a motive, though it is seems like the inclination to murder occurs no more than because MacMurray comes in by sheer chance. The usual understanding of the essential customs of its plot are that the man is weak to a subtly dominant woman. But he's detached, indifferent, thick-skinned, curt. He always refers to her with nicknames that make her sound like she's a product he likes to buy. And this brand name of his? She's cold as ice, but later she says she cares more about their being together than the money. If they both seem driven by greed, then that is why they plot to kill her husband, but I am not quite convinced of that. And if they ever have a passion for or attraction to each other, it appears as if more like pretension, or like they are deceiving each other into thinking that way, because either way, that tension dwindles later on. Both are infatuated not so much by the crime as by the adventure of perpetrating it with the other someone. The motives we assume throughout are simulations.When it all boils down, they are film noir caricatures with not much mental or emotional profundity or individuality, and that is the intent. Wilder said that the director can never flaunt his style in any technical sense because it would distract from the story. So, in essence, he wisely believes that a director must hide. Pertaining to Double Indemnity, Wilder's sense of remaining hidden is ahead of the film's time, audience, its story and its characters. I would give anything to travel back in time to witness first-hand Wilder directing MacMurray and Stanwyck on the set. What could he have possibly said? He isn't concerned with the same issues the characters are, but rather what happens to them subsequent to what they consider so central.More actual feeling is focused in a different place. It has to do with MacMurray's worry of being found out, and the way he feels about his boss, Edward G. Robinson, who robs every scene blind, plays the claims adjuster as an idealistic maverick who skates the edge of the dress code when he wants to loosen up, treats his office like his own personal den at home, chain smokes, and sees MacMurray as his protégé. He plays a paternal role for him. He's also constantly thinking thinking thinking, and sooner or later he figures things out, setting in motion moments of uneasy apprehension in us, the audience.Double Indemnity was one of the earlier films noir. The photography by visually facilitated the noir style of sharp-edged shade and silhouettes, peculiar points of view and lonesome urban surroundings. But Wilder may have achieved a timelessness with this movie through some of the sneakiest, most cunning directing ever. I don't believe that many people see the story the way he saw it, but he told it the way he saw it, in a manner that appeared to meet the natural presumptions of the audience. Subsequent noir may have borrowed from its visual style, but its narrative style remains more intact than even the most bewildering in film history.

The motives we assume throughout are simulations.When it all boils down, they are film noir caricatures with not much mental or emotional profundity or individuality, and that is the intent. Wilder said that the director can never flaunt his style in any technical sense because it would distract from the story. So, in essence, he wisely believes that a director must hide. Pertaining to Double Indemnity, Wilder's sense of remaining hidden is ahead of the film's time, audience, its story and its characters. I would give anything to travel back in time to witness first-hand Wilder directing MacMurray and Stanwyck on the set. What could he have possibly said? He isn't concerned with the same issues the characters are, but rather what happens to them subsequent to what they consider so central.More actual feeling is focused in a different place. It has to do with MacMurray's worry of being found out, and the way he feels about his boss, Edward G. Robinson, who robs every scene blind, plays the claims adjuster as an idealistic maverick who skates the edge of the dress code when he wants to loosen up, treats his office like his own personal den at home, chain smokes, and sees MacMurray as his protégé. He plays a paternal role for him. He's also constantly thinking thinking thinking, and sooner or later he figures things out, setting in motion moments of uneasy apprehension in us, the audience.Double Indemnity was one of the earlier films noir. The photography by visually facilitated the noir style of sharp-edged shade and silhouettes, peculiar points of view and lonesome urban surroundings. But Wilder may have achieved a timelessness with this movie through some of the sneakiest, most cunning directing ever.

They swagger from beginning to end the practice of a drum-tight murder scheme with dangerous figures of speech and chilly flirting, but they never give the certain impression that they actually care about one another to any particular degree, neither do they evoke such a concrete desire for the insurance money.Wilder dug out the rapport between MacMurray and Robinson. To give a sample of the plot is easy, but it is better to see this film without reading too much about it, because really it is the shade that makes it enticing. A crafty scheme. Though why?

It reminded me, though it isn't a horror film, of all the times I used to stay up in the past to watch old horror films, loving the fact that although few of them were spectacular, it was just fun to be able to see weird old b movies from the days when b grade genre pictures were often pretty decent. Saturn 3 has a small cast, comprising mainly Kirk Douglas, Farrah Fawcett as his wife, and Harvey Keitel as the sinister Captain James, who intrudes upon their cosy existence manufacturing food on Saturn 3. Farrah Fawcett looks nice and has a blandly appealing presence but isn't that much of an actress. Kirk Douglas brings a rugged, stoical gravitas to his role and is quite watchable, though his portrayal seems a bit stiff for the role. Its hard to judge Harvey Keitels performance since he was dubbed over. This is unfrotunate because it gives his human character a robotic feel. The film is fast paced, thrilling and wonderfully designed, with excellent special effects, especially Hector the robot. Hector is a great creation and has lots to do during the film, once it gets going. Also, as the film goes on, it seems to definitely have influenced the film Virus, with Jamie Lee Curtis, as well as other later science fiction films Though the characterisation seems a little weak the actors put their all into it and since the film becomes focused on the Hector and technological villainry the lightly drawn characters don't hurt too much. The screenplay runs swiftly and has sufficient vigor to paper over any cracks. Oddly, the screenplay is by acclaimed writer Martin Amis who penned great works such as Money or London Fields. Sadly the film has little of his sparkling language or savage wit but it does have a lot of excitement, some interesting themes and good dystopian details, especially in Keitel's characters attitudes. The final half hour or so is constantly tense and gripping, mounting to an inspired climax before a slightly weak final few moments. Sadly the film seems destined to mainly be seen in a truncated form instead of the 100 or so minute one mentioned on IMDb. The film definitely could have been more fleshed out, for there is the odd interesting point that is not expanded. However, the 85 or so minute cut is a such a tight, compelling ride that it is hard to criticise. With better acting, more characters or the 100 minute cut this could possibly have been really great. As it is I'd still definitely recommend it to science fiction or robot movie enthusiasts since its has some great ideas, effects that hold up well today and some good thrills. Worthwhile.

Victoria (Julie Andrews) is down on her luck. Oh, not as bad as George Orwell in Down and Out in Paris and London, but pretty far down, this being the depression. She develops a scheme to cheat her way through a full meal at a restaurant by planting a cockroach in her salad. It more or less works but, more important, she runs into cheerful, savvy, gay Robert Preston who becomes her manager.Andrews has been unable to find work as a soprano because singers are a glut on the market, but Preston promotes her as a female impersonator. She succeeds wildly. Among the audience at one of her shows in a fancy nightclub is rich James Garner, his coarse moll, Leslie Anne Warren, and his big, beefy bodyguard, Alex Karras.Garner is sexually aroused by Andrews' sultry performance and when she whips off her headgear and reveals herself as a man named Victor, Garner's face falls marvelously. He's been excited by a MAN! When he gets back to his room he needs to prove his manhood by virtually attacking Warren. Alas, his homosexual anxiety renders him impotent, but Warren is all understanding. Awww, honey, it's no big deal. Women are lucky. They can fake it. Oh, not with YOU, baby! Listen, just 'cause you can't get it -- Up till now it's been wonderful. After that, it gets complicated.The writing is sharply witty. In the restaurant, at the very beginning, when Andrews and Preston meet, there is a hilarious exchange between Preston and the waiter, played by Graham Stark as one of those contemptuous French waiters who always seems distracted, as if mentally deconstructing La Pensee Sauvage, you know, and you're interrupting his cogitation. But Preston, being gay, is his equal. Stark pours a glass of white wine for Preston, who squints at it with distaste and remarks, The last time I saw something like this they had to shoot the horse. Preston is trying to dress Andrews as a man and teach her to act in a masculine fashion. He tells her thoughtfully, There are two main obstacles we must overcome. Andrews asks, My bosom?, and then adds that if she has to bind her bosom for years it will wind up looking like an old wallet. After Andrews' success, Preston checks them into a three-star hotel and announces, You must see the bathroom. It's a religious experience. Much of the humor revolves around gender bending, of course, but the script treats the audience as reasonably sophisticated rather than 19th-century rural twits. I don't think Blake Edwards depends on shock value for laughs. The laughs arise out of the situations.There are a couple of songs thrown in. Julie Andrews has a splendid voice, and a range that runs from elephantine sub-rumble to air raid siren. The dance numbers are elaborately staged, with what I take to be a deliberate homage to Bob Fosse -- plenty of derbies, clicking fingers, and swiveling pelvises.There's a mostly dull romantic piece in the mosaic, done seriously, in which Andrews and Garner try to come to terms with the fact that they love each other, although if they want to keep her real sex a secret, they must go dancing at a gay bar. And some of the comic interludes seems a little forced, at least on multiple viewings. Andrews, in her masculine disguise, bravely accepts a cigar -- and coughs. She looks immeasurably better as a woman than as a man. And the final number, in which Preston is in drag and singing one of Andrews' numbers and falling all over himself, isn't really either imaginative or very amusing.But those are small things. Overall, this is a funny farce, skillfully written, directed, and performed.

It more or less works but, more important, she runs into cheerful, savvy, gay Robert Preston who becomes her manager.Andrews has been unable to find work as a soprano because singers are a glut on the market, but Preston promotes her as a female impersonator. She succeeds wildly. Among the audience at one of her shows in a fancy nightclub is rich James Garner, his coarse moll, Leslie Anne Warren, and his big, beefy bodyguard, Alex Karras.Garner is sexually aroused by Andrews' sultry performance and when she whips off her headgear and reveals herself as a man named Victor, Garner's face falls marvelously. He's been excited by a MAN! When he gets back to his room he needs to prove his manhood by virtually attacking Warren. Alas, his homosexual anxiety renders him impotent, but Warren is all understanding. Awww, honey, it's no big deal. Women are lucky. They can fake it. Oh, not with YOU, baby! Listen, just 'cause you can't get it -- Up till now it's been wonderful. After that, it gets complicated.The writing is sharply witty. In the restaurant, at the very beginning, when Andrews and Preston meet, there is a hilarious exchange between Preston and the waiter, played by Graham Stark as one of those contemptuous French waiters who always seems distracted, as if mentally deconstructing La Pensee Sauvage, you know, and you're interrupting his cogitation. But Preston, being gay, is his equal. Stark pours a glass of white wine for Preston, who squints at it with distaste and remarks, The last time I saw something like this they had to shoot the horse. Preston is trying to dress Andrews as a man and teach her to act in a masculine fashion. He tells her thoughtfully, There are two main obstacles we must overcome. Andrews asks, My bosom?, and then adds that if she has to bind her bosom for years it will wind up looking like an old wallet. After Andrews' success, Preston checks them into a three-star hotel and announces, You must see the bathroom. It's a religious experience. Much of the humor revolves around gender bending, of course, but the script treats the audience as reasonably sophisticated rather than 19th-century rural twits. I don't think Blake Edwards depends on shock value for laughs. The laughs arise out of the situations.There are a couple of songs thrown in. Julie Andrews has a splendid voice, and a range that runs from elephantine sub-rumble to air raid siren. The dance numbers are elaborately staged, with what I take to be a deliberate homage to Bob Fosse -- plenty of derbies, clicking fingers, and swiveling pelvises.There's a mostly dull romantic piece in the mosaic, done seriously, in which Andrews and Garner try to come to terms with the fact that they love each other, although if they want to keep her real sex a secret, they must go dancing at a gay bar. And some of the comic interludes seems a little forced, at least on multiple viewings. Andrews, in her masculine disguise, bravely accepts a cigar -- and coughs. She looks immeasurably better as a woman than as a man. And the final number, in which Preston is in drag and singing one of Andrews' numbers and falling all over himself, isn't really either imaginative or very amusing.But those are small things.

Much of Something About Mary's humor is about sticky situations, and I mean this literally and figuratively. . . It's crude (what other movie ends with the dialogue, I was only bonin' you to get to Mary?), you bet - but it also has a charming good-naturedness about it that later, more cynical exercises in gross-out comedy (i.e. the American Pie trilogy) would lack. In fact, remember that guy from high school who was always trying way too hard to be the class clown? American Pie, and especially its sequels, are like that guy. His freshness wore out quickly, and he eventually became a self-conscious parody of himself. The plot of Mary essentially revolves around a group of love-hungry boobs who desperately want to hook up with Mary. Stiller was her high-school prom-date; Chris Elliot was her college boyfriend, etc. Each guy tries to sabotage the other guys, and Mary is stuck in the middle of their kooky antics. Simple? Yes - but Mary's not supposed to be a weighty Oscar juggernaut steeped in critic-baiting societal metaphors - it's supposed to be fun. And trust me, it totally succeeds, here.

Woody plays Harry, an author who has turned the situations of those around him into thinly-disguised stories and novels. Many of these incidents, involving wives and girlfriends, he relives throughout the film, with other people playing Harry and the other people involved. For instance, Julia Louis-Dreyfus plays Leslie in the memory scenes, with the role in the present being played by Judy Davis. Now suffering from writer's block, Harry is being honored by the college that expelled him, and he wants someone to go along with him, preferably his son. His ex-wife (Kirstie Alley) is inflexible about changing visiting days, so instead, he invites a hooker to go with him, along with a friend who the day before thought he was dying but received a clean bill of health from the doctor. On their way, they stop and kidnap Harry's son as an outraged mother (Hemingway) screams for the police.Allen touches on a few of the serious points that have appeared in his films from time to time religion, the role of art and psychiatry. Harry believes that religion is by definition exclusionary - each religion feels that they have the direct route to God. He really lets the Jews have it in this one with an enacted very nonreverential story that he's reminded of by his deeply religious sister. Harry's art is his life; he goes from woman to woman, unable to make a commitment, and lives through his characters.There were many funny scenes in Deconstructing Harry, but two absolutely top of the line ones The first one is in the beginning, when Leslie (Davis) comes to his apartment with his latest novel and threatens him with a gun. The scene is priceless - some feel that Judy Davis can be over the top, but she is absolutely hilarious as a woman who recognizes herself in his book. The second takes place in his home, when his psychiatrist wife finds out that he was having sex with one of her patients, and despite her rage, attempts to conduct a therapy session with one Mr. Goldfarb. However, she keeps excusing herself so that she can leave the room and scream her guts out at Harry. Finally, she just starts screaming at him while she's sitting in the office, with Goldfarb on the couch. Fantastic.I remember that this film got ghastly reviews, and from reading the first comment here, it appears the language and sexual situations were the problem. I admit I could have done without some of it, but Allen has been writing and making films for many years - if he wants to do something a little different, why not.

","genre":"Comedy"},{"date":"23 September 2008","score":"","review":" Woody Allen stars in Deconstructing Harry, a film of his own invention, of course, written and directed by him, with an all-star cast including Demi Moore, Judy Davis, Richard Benjamin, Julia Louis-Dreyfuss, Billy Crystal, Elisabeth Shue, Bob Balaban, Robin Williams, Amy Irving, Mariel Hemingway, Stanley Tucci and Kirstie Alley. Woody plays Harry, an author who has turned the situations of those around him into thinly-disguised stories and novels. Many of these incidents, involving wives and girlfriends, he relives throughout the film, with other people playing Harry and the other people involved. For instance, Julia Louis-Dreyfus plays Leslie in the memory scenes, with the role in the present being played by Judy Davis. Now suffering from writer's block, Harry is being honored by the college that expelled him, and he wants someone to go along with him, preferably his son. His ex-wife (Kirstie Alley) is inflexible about changing visiting days, so instead, he invites a hooker to go with him, along with a friend who the day before thought he was dying but received a clean bill of health from the doctor. On their way, they stop and kidnap Harry's son as an outraged mother (Hemingway) screams for the police.Allen touches on a few of the serious points that have appeared in his films from time to time religion, the role of art and psychiatry. Harry believes that religion is by definition exclusionary - each religion feels that they have the direct route to God. He really lets the Jews have it in this one with an enacted very nonreverential story that he's reminded of by his deeply religious sister. Harry's art is his life; he goes from woman to woman, unable to make a commitment, and lives through his characters.There were many funny scenes in Deconstructing Harry, but two absolutely top of the line ones The first one is in the beginning, when Leslie (Davis) comes to his apartment with his latest novel and threatens him with a gun. The scene is priceless - some feel that Judy Davis can be over the top, but she is absolutely hilarious as a woman who recognizes herself in his book. The second takes place in his home, when his psychiatrist wife finds out that he was having sex with one of her patients, and despite her rage, attempts to conduct a therapy session with one Mr. Goldfarb. However, she keeps excusing herself so that she can leave the room and scream her guts out at Harry. Finally, she just starts screaming at him while she's sitting in the office, with Goldfarb on the couch. Fantastic.I remember that this film got ghastly reviews, and from reading the first comment here, it appears the language and sexual situations were the problem. I admit I could have done without some of it, but Allen has been writing and making films for many years - if he wants to do something a little different, why not. At any rate, it did not take away from my enjoyment of much of this film. It's a little uneven but totally worth seeing. ","genre":"Comedy"}]
