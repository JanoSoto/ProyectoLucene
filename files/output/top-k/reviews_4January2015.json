The movie really tries to create suspense by long, strange sounds, rather than jump scares. Some of the scenes are creepy only because of the ongoing sounds, the sounds go on for so long you can not possibly know when to wait for the scary part, sometimes there is nothing, and the sound completely fools the viewer.I don't know why, but i didn't really see Jack going insane during the movie, i saw him as an insane person right from the get go, the way he answered questions at the interview was rather strange. Jack never really showed any feelings for his family, obviously right from the start something was very wrong with him.Really didn't like the performance of Wendy, Jack's wife, she was the dumbest person ever, she had no self esteem whatsoever, did whatever Jack told her, he told her to screw off several times and she didn't even care. She was about to get murdered and she is not even smart enough to knock out the wooden frame of the window to escape her insane husband...There were scenes in the movie which were incredibly long, that was not that bad, because some of the conversations were just awesome, for example, Jack talking to Delbert Grady in the bathroom, one of the best conversations i have ever seen in any movie.The ending scene, or rather the picture that was shown, was very interesting, that lead viewers to craft several theories over the years, which, of course, is crucial for the longevity of a movie, if the ending is something you need to think about and you can never really find the right answer, it has been a good ending. Personally, i believe that Jack was the ''care taker'' of the hotel and that was a reincarnation of Jack in the 1920's, since he was in the picture shot in 1920's looking exactly the same as he did 60 years later.Danny was very interesting too, i feel that his ''shine'' attracted the dead spirits, but Danny's interaction with the dead was not as strong as Jack's, really i haven't been able to see the correlation between Danny's ''shine'' and Jack's ability to connect with the dead.If you want to fully understand the story, i suppose, reading the book would be very beneficial, since in the book all the characters are explained in details, however the movie is a good horror classic, quite different that other movies, but i just can't agree with ''the best psychological horror movie of all time'' title people have been giving the movie.

I finally found a copy of 'Signs' in a thrift shop and decided to check it out for myself. I waited until it turned dark, turned out all the lights, and settling in for a thrilling adventure...The story immediately introduces the audience to eerie and mysterious crop circles in Graham's (Mel Gibson) corn field, where he finds his kids walking around (in a typical children-who- casually-say-something-creepy-to-their-worried-parent fashion) after waking up. The plot then delves into the realms of extra-terrestrial life from the viewpoint of an average family (by average I mean average on-screen family, where there is a young boy, younger girl, single parent (with a deceased spouse), and some other family member who has come to live with them) who live in a small, rural town in their old farmhouse. Many reviewers see 'Signs' favorably because of its attention to the realistic aspect of a hypothetical alien invasion, focusing on just your average family and how they see what is going on in the outside world. However, Shyamalan goes too far in this regard, using sometimes extremely cheesy dialogue and several awkwardly written scenes to stress this family's averageness.I won't go any further into the plot, and anyway I feel like there is nowhere else to go. Throughout the movie, the dialogue felt extremely forced and it sometimes felt more like I was reading a screenplay off a piece of paper than watching a film. I was expecting much more depth and character development going into this Shyamalan movie, especially after watching 'The Sixth Sense.' However, I was highly disappointed, as the film felt like a failed attempt at incorporating the psychological elements and suspense of 'The Sixth Sense' into an extra-terrestrial thriller\/horror film (I mean really, Mel Gibson even begins to look like Bruce Willis after a while). I gave it a 4\/10 because the directing and cinematography is decent (I enjoy Shyamalan's style), but the screenplay is extremely sub-par. The premise of 'Signs' isn't half bad, but it would have made a much better short film than full-length feature. The acting and directing is fine, but the film felt hollow, with a solid shell and nothing to fill it. In addition, there was an unexpected and completely unnecessary religious element added to the film (I won't go into detail to avoid accidentally giving out spoilers) that completely changed the general feel of the movie from a psychological, extraterrestrial thriller to that of a religious flick, in my mind.If you're looking for a psychological thriller, sci-fi, or horror film that will keep you as engaged as 'The Sixth Sense' and leave you staring at the screen, this movie isn't for you. Just watch the 'The Sixth Sense' again. However, if you enjoy Shyamalan's style and want to see his take on an extraterrestrial thriller, you may enjoy 'Signs.' Just don't expect to leave the movie in awe or have any nightmares about it (you're more likely to have nightmares about the screenplay than the actual aliens in the film).(I'm not even going to get into the plot holes, just read the other reviews...)

First, there are the comparisons to other movies previously directed or produced by Howard Hawks, such as To Have and Have Not (1944) and The Thing from Another World (1951); as well as two of his subsequent Westerns, El Dorado (1966) and Rio Lobo (1970), each of which also stars John Wayne.Then there is High Noon (1952), which Hawks disliked so much on account of the way Marshall Kane (Gary Cooper) goes around asking ordinary citizens for help and finally has to be saved by his Quaker wife that he made Rio Bravo in response, in which Sheriff Chance only wants professionals to help him. But whereas High Noon is grim, Rio Bravo is lighthearted, with many scenes played for laughs, and with a scene in which the good guys sing a couple of cute songs. Had Hawks not explicitly made the comparison of his movie to High Noon, I would never have noticed, for the plot is quite different as well.Then there is The Man Who Shot Liberty Valence (1962), directed by John Ford, who apparently did not approve of what happened in Rio Bravo. In Rio Bravo, the humiliating spittoon scene in the beginning leads to someone getting shot; in The Man Who Shot Liberty Valence, when Valence (Lee Marvin) trips Stoddard (James Stewart), which leads to a confrontation with Doniphon (John Wayne), Stoddard defuses the situation and nothing bad happens.Then there is Assault on Precinct 13 (1976), which has a similar story, although it is not a western.Then there is A Fistful of Dollars (1964). Director Sergio Leone told composer Ennio Morricone that he wanted the music in his movie to be like the Deguello played in Rio Bravo.That much I learned from reading reviews of film critics. But one comparison that occurs to me is North to Alaska (1960), also starring John Wayne, but, more importantly, starring Fabian. Fabian is a rock 'n' roll singer like Ricky Nelson, but a much better actor. I would have preferred to have him cast as Colorado in Rio Bravo, and he could have sung along with Dean Martin.Another performance in the movie that I did not care for was that of Angie Dickenson as Feathers. If Rio Bravo were the only movie I had ever seen her in, I would think she was a bad actress. But her acting in other movies is fine, so the fault must be with the role that was handed to her. It comes across as forced and artificial. In fact, now that I think about it, maybe Ricky Nelson was not to blame for his performance as Colorado either.Despite these weak performances, and despite a weak plot that does not always make sense, it nevertheless all adds up to a pretty good movie. It's not as good as High Noon though.

Odd then that the end result in this case looks like an episode of the original Dr. Who television series.In Krull, a young woman is kidnapped and her lover, the soon-to-be- king of a fictional kingdom, sets out to get her back. There's your story, and it plays out over a series of incompetently staged action sequences on what look like papier mache sets. It's a bad movie lover's dream, bad in a wildly entertaining way. Everyone involved takes the thing very seriously, which makes it much more enjoyable than if they had realized they were making a cornball movie and had played it tongue in cheek.

I strongly doubted this was better than Saving Private Ryan and Shakespeare in Love, but I didn't think it would be that far behind. Because Siskel and Ebert gave it a better review than the first movie, and they are both very trustworthy critics, I took their word for it being a great film.

Also, since it takes place in a city, mostly at night, it it not as beautiful as the nature filled farm in the first. We do see the farm in this, but only for a short amount of time.

Maybe the set wasn't as nice as the first, but it was still very well made and admirable. The development is a bit weaker, but some of your favourite barnyard friends are back and we meet some new, lovable animals.

Another strong aspect of the film is the actual screenplay, which contains all sorts of bad, adult language but everything just feels and flows so naturally that you can't help but feel as if you're watching a real troubled couple and a real thief getting thrown together.THE REF isn't a flawless film by any stretch of the imagination but there are certainly enough laughs to keep it moving well.

I felt so many emotions while I watched it, joy, anxiety, fear, anger and excitement, to state a few. This movie truly absorbed me, I was transfixed until the end credits, and it's one of the only films that moved me, it really hit me to the core. A Beautiful Mind is the story of John Nash (Russell Crowe), a genius mathematician, he is an anti-social guy and very awkward at times. And the film follows his story. After a series of events, John is diagnosed with schizophrenia and his life falls apart, however his story does not end on a sad note. Now this is just a quick breakdown of the whole thing, there are many other events that occur in between (obviously), and all of them are memorable, in part due to the emotional story and even more due to the fantastic acting. The way the film shows the grief and burden that is brought upon Nash and the people closest to him due to his schizophrenia is the film's biggest success, in my opinion. The acting in this movie is stupendous, every single actor in the movie does an incredible job, especially of course, the brilliant Russell Crowe. This man is a wizard of an actor, his portrayal of John Nash is quite frankly the best acting I have ever seen in my life, the fact that he didn't win an Oscar for this portrayal made me give up on the Academy entirely. There is no doubt in this world that Crowe embodied Nash on every level, his walk, voice and face are all amazing, even more so after discovering his problem. Jennifer Connelly plays John's wife, Alicia, a very emotionally charged character, with all the hardships she has to go through, and Connelly portrays her just like that, very powerful acting, there's a scene where she freaks out in the bathroom, one word, stunning. The rest of the supporting cast are also great, Ed Harris, as a secret agent, Paul Bettany as John's best friend, Charles and Christopher Plummer as Dr. Rosen, a psychiatrist who treats John's disorder.The screenplay is superb, every piece of dialogue is amazing, nothing in the movie feels out of place or redundant. The entire film is shot masterfully by Ron Howard, who manages to keep the viewers engaged through the entire film, and making the audience experience the mental illness that John suffers from by putting us in his point of view. And the film does have many, many touching moments, the ending hit me very hard, however the most beautiful and heart-warming scene was the pen ceremony. It was too much, seeing him get acknowledged by all his peers in that way, with the moving music in the back, the whole piece brought tears to my eyes. One of my favorite scenes ever, for this alone, Howard deserved many awards and endless praise. I cannot stress how amazing this film is, it made me feel so many things throughout its run time, however by the time the credits rolled, the feeling that prevailed was absolute joy, for having had such an amazing time. To me, A Beautiful Mind was not just a film, it was a true experience, a beautiful film, and a masterpiece in every sense of the word, it is the best film I have ever seen in my entire life.

I felt so many emotions while I watched it, joy, anxiety, fear, anger and excitement, to state a few. This movie truly absorbed me, I was transfixed until the end credits, and it's one of the only films that moved me, it really hit me to the core. A Beautiful Mind is the story of John Nash (Russell Crowe), a genius mathematician, he is an anti-social guy and very awkward at times. And the film follows his story. After a series of events, John is diagnosed with schizophrenia and his life falls apart, however his story does not end on a sad note. Now this is just a quick breakdown of the whole thing, there are many other events that occur in between (obviously), and all of them are memorable, in part due to the emotional story and even more due to the fantastic acting. The way the film shows the grief and burden that is brought upon Nash and the people closest to him due to his schizophrenia is the film's biggest success, in my opinion. The acting in this movie is stupendous, every single actor in the movie does an incredible job, especially of course, the brilliant Russell Crowe.

It's a good comparison, as both were the best work of two media geniuses, and neither were financial successes at the box office. Both were also panned by movie critics. David Bowie is the only person who could have played Jereth the Goblin King. His songs and the main theme fit the movie perfectly. Produced with all the cutting edge wizardry of it's time, it still holds up well today. The story is a bit confusing at first, because the prologue was either cut from the screenplay or the film. Her mother is not dead. Her dad has remarried. Mom ran off with a rock star that strongly resembled David Bowie. How does magic fit into all of this? Does she imagine the whole thing? It's a fantasy. The comparisons to Alice and Wonderland, The Wizard of Oz, and Where the Wild Things Are are (somewhat) obvious. Sarah must wander through the enchanted Labyrinth to save Toby, her new baby brother, from The Goblin King. Costume issues Jennifer, like Annette Funicello, is growing up much too fast, and her costumes try to minimize this. David Bowie is a bit too perky in his skin-tight spandex tights. Instead of the Cowardly Lion, we have the furry cowardly gentle giant beast Ludo. Very entertaining and otherwise quite original with incredible special effects. Amazing puppetry, and a lot of people in Muppet suits. All new characters. None of the usual Muppet gang. As in all Henson productions, war-like behavior is ridiculed, as is greed and avaricious behavior. (The Junk Lady is the collector of useless, meaningless items, and shows that these things cling to all of us.) Children will see it as fairy tale or adventure. Adults will comprehend it's deeper meaning. My only dislikes are the gnome peeing in the stream, and the Bog of Eternal Stench. The helping hands are a 40 foot drop! The giant mechanical warrior is an amazing feat. Perhaps the world's tallest Muppet. The talking cannon-balls (Did I hit anything?) are too much fun! Trademark Henson ending, with a reprise of all the imaginary characters! Excellent featurettes show how amazing the puppetry and sets were, especially for 1986! (David Bowie's other masterpiece is The Man Who Fell to Earth.)
