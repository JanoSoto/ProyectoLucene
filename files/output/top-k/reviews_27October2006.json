At least that of the silent movie idiom. I just bought and watched (for the first time) Limelight and it is the first Chaplin talkie I have watched. So, I have nothing to compare it to. Frankly I was astonished at how maudlin and depressing the overall feeling is throughout. The theme of the film could have developed into a powerful drama but in my eyes sunk into self-indulgent and a surprisingly poor story. Let's take Chaplin himself. He was well known for his ability to play a drunk and did so many times in films, hearkening back to his pre-film days in England. His drunken state in the film is always the same without drawing out much more than a cardboard rendition of a drunken state. His wobbling about never has anything humorous about it. If it was meant to appear dramatic or tragic than it did not even come close to suggesting this. I was left wondering, always wondering, where is he going with this? For me it went plodding along to nothingness.Let's examine Claire Bloom. In far too many scenes her acting is overwrought and over the top. I ended up wondering if she was creating a parody of a tragic heroine? The early romance with the composer that she was unable to fulfill re-appears later in the film, all of it manipulated over and over again by an ambivalent Chaplin who does not quite believe what he's doing with his machinations. Chaplin's character seems to be so washed up that the only time he comes to life is when he's saving someone else's. Claire Bloom is a fine actor but the script and the direction turn her into a rag doll that is pushed around the screen by Chaplin.There are some strengths in the film and it's a shame Chaplin didn't develop them further. The odd choice of Bloom's character falling in love with a man who could be her grandfather is not given enough twist or edge. Perhaps that would have been asking just a wee bit too much of an early 50's audience to stomach? Still, the platonic love she offers is spurned by Chaplin but at the first opportunity, six months later, she is right back where she started from, fully in love with Chaplin. Even though she says she's grown older and maybe wiser, her actions defy her words. There is a very shocking scene which jolted me and that is where just before Bloom is to dance before a huge crowd she cries to Chaplin that she's lost the feelings in her feet and legs and can't go on. He shouts at her and then when this is not good enough he slaps her on the face so hard he could have snapped her neck. The smacking sound in the movie is very pronounced and the effect on the viewer is very powerful. In keeping with the over the top elements of the drama, she goes on to dance her heart out and bring the house down. It's just way too exaggerated and unbelievable.Keaton I've read that some people think that Chaplin brought Keaton into this film as a gesture, albeit a very token one, to an old colleague from the good old days. Keaton is not introduced, we don't know why he's there (unless I missed something) and yet there he is at Chaplin's very important benefit concert. This scene leads me into another weakness in the film. The skit that Chaplin first puts on at the benefit is a repeat of what we've seen him do at least 2 or 3 times earlier in the film and it's a very bad version of a badly talented second rate hack from Vaudeville-type shows. Why he created this characterization was lost on me the first time but after 3 times I was more than a little perturbed. Was Chaplin insisting we believe that his character never had any talent in the first place? That would be contradictory to earlier information we are told about Calvero.So, we put up with Chaplin's terrible rendition and then Keaton joins him on the stage during the encore. At last the sparks begin to fly. Finally we have the two undisputed masters putting on a delicious sequence of slapstick. And I laughed out loud for the first time in the entire film. Keaton is hilarious and Chaplin is wonderful. These old guys never lost a single bit of their timing. What is so clear in this sequence is that what is funny (at least in this film) is two guys acting as if they were in a silent picture! They don't say anything but we are in stitches, just like we all were when we watched their many silent films.The movie comes to an over-the-top end just a few minutes later. I sat there with my mouth open wondering what on earth Chaplin was thinking? He could have made us cry but the drama in the film was overt, exaggerated, bathos in full, pathetic only in it's underdevelopment. This was a man who created the most memorable characters in silent movies; he knew how to write and to direct and for me this film was stillborn from the getgo. If he was in the mood for self-indulgent sighing about his past, like almost all late Jerry Lewis comedy, then he did it very badly. Honestly, I was astonished at how bad this film was and I do not know why others rave about it. I am still a fan but this film left me confused and dumbfounded.

They were messed up in various ways by the diary, she was sunk by their reactions. The fictional Harriet of Harriet The Spy 1996 faced a parallel challenge and H did even worst. When Susanna left she tried to appease Georgina &#150; Clea, yet the way she did it was smelly. She showed that she still did not have a good understanding of the utility and ethics of journal therapy. She was reacting to the criticism in a way that said poor or chained understanding leading to poor mental health. Chained understanding? Mid teens I was inspired to want to write think things through notes. My ethics made me freeze instead. Hedgehog Ostrich, drifter. Susanna and Georgina froze at different stages. Lisa? I do not know how Susanna's book shows this aspect, but I would be surprised if it was not a real problem.

As well as the notes she needs more tools, even practical permissions to examine and modify her childhood understandings of appropriate good sense. She shows me that she had a shortfall in her toolkit, that the supervision had needed to help her get that more okay. At least she could have done worse. * Madonna.

In the UK there is the possibility for transgendered with the right medical references to gain the legal rights and responsibilities of our acquired gender. I really had not considered it worthwhile for me to try to gather the appropriate references, as if basic civil rights was likely too expensive. Expensive in all sorts of ways. Health professionals have a much more advanced toolkit, in some ways, than a singer. Not that this Madonna is lacking. What we have in the UK is gender recognition for those who can face the hurdles. What one really needs might include acceptance and tolerance. Lisa and Susanna raise nice questions. * A story of personal relevance, but reading all the comments none covered what this is to me.

It had great action,cool looking good guys & bad guys and hey,Adrienne Barbeau! Unfortunately,it was rated R for language,violence and partail nudity. I happened to be 13 at the time & my oldest brother while 17 got away with saying he was 18. I still couldn't join my two brothers & their friends,so I had to see Arthur w\/Dudley Moore (or did I?)

Since then,despite the success of this film,it's been labeled a cult classic and it's now marking it's 25th anniversary as we speak. It's rather funny now to hear in 1998 crime went up over 200% or such. Although fictional,it seemed like a scary prospect but once Snake received his reluctant mission,I forgot about all that.There's certainly enough reviews here describing the plot about Snake going in to the maximum security prison that New York City has become,to save the President of The United States. So I'll just say from the moment he lands,the race is on and the nail biting begins! Kurt Russel never looked so tough on screen before and he plays it just right,not over the top,which could have been laughable.Supporting players Ernest Borgnine,Adrienne Barbeau,Lee Van Cleef (in quite a subdued part for him),Issac Hayes & Donald Pleasance all play their parts wonderfully. The mood of the world has turned dark and gloomy and the attitudes of the actors reflect that. Always funny to me though will be when Snake meets up with a Billy Idol looking punk and the guy hisses at him!

At Christmas 1980, Shelby announces her pregnancy. Jack Jr. is born on the 3rd of July, 1981, and his 1st birthday is celebrated in the movie in July 1982, in the days before Shelby's kidney transplant. Annelle is not visibly pregnant when she comes running out with the pot of beans for Shelby's family. Then Shelby has her rejection scene at Halloween, when Annelle has her wedding shower (we can't see her well enough to know if she's already visibly pregnant); Jack looks like he's no more than 15 months old, so it's probably still 1982. At Shelby's funeral, it's autumn and Annelle suddenly looks pregnant and talks about the baby (she'd be 3-4 months along at this point), and Jack Jr. still looks really little when M'Lynn picks him up from Aunt Fern's. Annelle's baby is then born at Easter time, at most 6 months after the funeral; in those final scenes, Jack Jr. looks a LOT older than 22 months, which is what he would have to be at that point.

It was a great pleasure to see it again.

They would live someplace where they would be perceived as two Englishmen, rather than as two different kinds of Englishmen. After a couple years, Alec's eye would wander, and he would stray. But he'd be sure to be home every night with Maurice, snug as bugs in a rug.

It was also one of Grace Kelley's greatest performances. When I study the movie after having watched it several times I get a lot more good out of it. I like Coop. He was my all time favorite.

It's a David Lynch movie so it's no surprise that it is weird. I defy anyone to totally explain everything in this film. I can't be done. After some research following my second viewing of this film, I pretty much know most of the story but on a first look, and with no aid from other reviewers or outside help, it is hard to figure things out. So, if you're in that boat and was confused, don't feel bad; that's normal. Let me just say the key to the film is Naomi Watts' character.At any rate, I find the film fascinating. I love the wonderful visuals and rich colors and find each character in this movie really different and fun to watch. The camera-work is excellent and the music is creepy, a la Lynch's Blue Velvet. There also are some good sound effects to help some of the dramatic scenes. In all, it's very well scored.Like Lynch's Twin Peaks television series, this was a film in which the end was pieced together afterward since Lynch thought this film was going to be a long, drawn-out TV series. When that didn't happen, he pieced at the last minute this ending. That may account for some of the confusion at the end and the lack of explanations concerning characters we see earlier in the film but who mysteriously disappear.The theme of the story, supposedly, is a negative comment about Hollywood and what it does to people, especially those whose dreams of being an actor are crushed.Both Watts and the other leading lady, Laura Eleana Harring, are very interesting to watch, especially in their celebrated lesbian sex scene. Looks- wise, both women were chameleons, looking average at times, stunning at other times.I enjoyed this movie more on the second viewing than the first. It's not just a curiosity piece; it's a very intriguing movie.....just don't feel stupid if you can't make sense of a few things.

I do happen to appreciate B-grade flicks like this, but that's only part of the reason. It's also b\/c this movie achieves exactly what it sets out to do and it has a lot of positive elements.It's obvious that movies like these are simply meant to entertain. We have an interesting setting, heavily armed commandos, an attractive damsel, a unique threat, explosions, a macho hero, great one-liners and a likable cast. The truth is, those are all good ingredients for this type of movie to be successful. I believe the cast is probably the main thing that makes this film so likable. I think Treat Williams is an under-rated actor. He has turned in some good performances in other things, and I was surprised at how well he did in a role that isn't really like anything else he's been in. He isn't really considered the action-hero type, but his character of Finnegan is so stereotypical-macho hero, and he plays it to perfection. I love it!Kevin J. O'Connor is great as side-kick mechanic Joey. I like the chemistry between him and Williams and he definitely gets some of the best lines. Famke Jensen definitely qualifies as an attractive female lead. And the supporting cast all fill out their roles well. Yes, the action is far-fetched. Yes, some of the dialogue is cheesy. But what makes it so great is that it seems like the cast knows it and doesn't take them selves too seriously. I have always wanted there to be a sequel, but knowing Hollywood, they'd prolly just screw it up anyway. All in all, Deep Rising is a fun way to spend an hour and a half.

What can you expect from a film created by the same geniuses who did The Little Mermaid and Aladdin? Although there are a few errors in terms of the mythology it's based on, it's a fantastic watch. The comedy is flawless for all ages- I saw it for the first time when I was 9 years old and nine years later I'm still finding the jokes hilarious and discovering more gags that I hadn't spotted before. The songs are brilliant- the composer is a complete genius. I watched Hercules on DVD two days ago and I'm still singing the songs at random. They're catchy and just... wow. I love I Won't Say I'm In Love (Megara's solo). I'm still impressed with Susan Egan's singing voice to this day. The Muses... wow. I love the choral touch they add to the songs. And the fact that they're actually telling the story is really unique- it's kind of an advance from Aladdin where the stall owner is telling the story, except the Muses appear throughout the film whereas the stall owner only appears at the beginning of the first film and the end of the third. My favourite character is definitely Megara- what's not to love about her? She's tough, she's funny, she's sarcastic and she has a heart of gold. A classic Disney girl.

Paul packs his manuscript in his bag, checks out of the lodge & begins the journey back to New York. Unfortunately Paul didn't realise that he would have to drive through a severe blizzard & while trying to negotiate the difficult conditions he crashes his car, however help is at hand as he is rescued from the wreck by local resident Annie Wilkes (Kathy Bates) who also happens to be a nurse. Back at her farm where she lives alone Annie tends to Paul's injuries including a couple of broken legs & confesses to him that she is his biggest fan & has all of his books. At first Paul is relieved that she saved him but things take a turn for the worse when Annie reads his latest novel only to discover that he is killing the main character off, Paul soon finds out that Annie is a bit mad & will go to extreme lengths to make sure her favourite character's live on even if they're author doesn't...Co-produced & directed by Rob Reiner who also has a cameo in the film as the helicopter pilot, I thought Misery was a great watch. The script by William Goldman was based on the novel 'Misery' by Stephen King, which I have not read so I cannot compare the two, has a good pace to it, while it's slow & not that much actually happens it's very measured, effective & far from boring. The basic story is very engaging & very tense which is exactly what a dark psychological horror\/thriller such as Misery should be. There are only three character's of any substance in the film & while everything works well I thought there could have been a bit more background to Annie, for instance it emerges as the film progresses that she may have been responsible for the deaths of babies at the hospital where she worked but it is never confirmed & seems almost nothing more than an afterthought just to make her more 'evil' as it were. I have no idea what the medical\/mental condition is called that Annie suffers from or how accurately portrayed it is on screen but she's pretty scary at times & her unbalanced nature is both convincing & well used. I thought the ending lacked a little something & felt a bit rushed & I'm not sure if I'd want to see it again anytime soon but overall I think Misery is a fine film on various levels.Director Reiner does a great job at keeping the tension levels high & it's a film that draws you in & making you want to know how it ends. He keeps thing generally pretty simple, there's no flashy camera tricks or overblown set pieces but I'm sure that was intentional by the filmmakers. Whatever you may hear Misery is lacking as far as blood & violence goes, there's a scene where Annie breaks Paul's ankles with a sledgehammer although you actually 'see' virtually nothing on screen, it's a scene that sticks in the mind because of how it's achieved & frankly how painful it would be in reality. This is one area where the film is different to the original novel, in King's book Annie cuts Paul's foot off rather than breaking it. Trivia ironically I hurt my own ankle badly at work two weeks ago & went to hospital where x-rays showed I hadn't broken anything but I had a fair amount of soft tissue damage, it hurt so much I was in tears & couldn't even stand on it properly. I cringed while that scene was playing & I can't even imagine how painful it must have been...With a supposed budget of about $20,000,000 Misery is as well made & polished as you would hope for, it does what it has to very well. The acting was good by a pretty small cast. Apparently the role of Paul Sheldon was offered to Jack Nicholson, William Hurt, Kevin Kline, Michael Douglas, Harrison Ford, Dustin Hoffman, Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, Richard Dreyfuss, Gene Hackman, Robert Redford & Warren Beatty all of whom turned the role down, now that's some serious knock backs. Kathy Bates won an Osacr for best actress in a leading role for her performance in Misery.Misery is one of the very best Stephen King adaptations & a great film in it's own right, definitely well worth a watch.

At first Paul is relieved that she saved him but things take a turn for the worse when Annie reads his latest novel only to discover that he is killing the main character off, Paul soon finds out that Annie is a bit mad & will go to extreme lengths to make sure her favourite character's live on even if they're author doesn't...Co-produced & directed by Rob Reiner who also has a cameo in the film as the helicopter pilot, I thought Misery was a great watch. The script by William Goldman was based on the novel 'Misery' by Stephen King, which I have not read so I cannot compare the two, has a good pace to it, while it's slow & not that much actually happens it's very measured, effective & far from boring. The basic story is very engaging & very tense which is exactly what a dark psychological horror\/thriller such as Misery should be. There are only three character's of any substance in the film & while everything works well I thought there could have been a bit more background to Annie, for instance it emerges as the film progresses that she may have been responsible for the deaths of babies at the hospital where she worked but it is never confirmed & seems almost nothing more than an afterthought just to make her more 'evil' as it were. I have no idea what the medical\/mental condition is called that Annie suffers from or how accurately portrayed it is on screen but she's pretty scary at times & her unbalanced nature is both convincing & well used. I thought the ending lacked a little something & felt a bit rushed & I'm not sure if I'd want to see it again anytime soon but overall I think Misery is a fine film on various levels.Director Reiner does a great job at keeping the tension levels high & it's a film that draws you in & making you want to know how it ends. He keeps thing generally pretty simple, there's no flashy camera tricks or overblown set pieces but I'm sure that was intentional by the filmmakers. Whatever you may hear Misery is lacking as far as blood & violence goes, there's a scene where Annie breaks Paul's ankles with a sledgehammer although you actually 'see' virtually nothing on screen, it's a scene that sticks in the mind because of how it's achieved & frankly how painful it would be in reality. This is one area where the film is different to the original novel, in King's book Annie cuts Paul's foot off rather than breaking it. Trivia ironically I hurt my own ankle badly at work two weeks ago & went to hospital where x-rays showed I hadn't broken anything but I had a fair amount of soft tissue damage, it hurt so much I was in tears & couldn't even stand on it properly. I cringed while that scene was playing & I can't even imagine how painful it must have been...With a supposed budget of about $20,000,000 Misery is as well made & polished as you would hope for, it does what it has to very well. The acting was good by a pretty small cast. Apparently the role of Paul Sheldon was offered to Jack Nicholson, William Hurt, Kevin Kline, Michael Douglas, Harrison Ford, Dustin Hoffman, Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, Richard Dreyfuss, Gene Hackman, Robert Redford & Warren Beatty all of whom turned the role down, now that's some serious knock backs. Kathy Bates won an Osacr for best actress in a leading role for her performance in Misery.Misery is one of the very best Stephen King adaptations & a great film in it's own right, definitely well worth a watch.
