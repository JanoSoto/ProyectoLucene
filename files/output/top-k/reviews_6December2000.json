Okay so I saw the movie and I didn't like... that much is true. It had a SINGLE moment of terror that just about killed me, but that's because it had to do with fingers in a wound and I can't take that... ANYWAYS.Look at a movie from its honest plot and acting ability, rather than bashing it for the genre. There's absolutely nothing wrong with hating a genre. I hate sappy love stories. So I just don't see them. Simple as that. What's become a problem with the REBIRTH of slashers after the release of SCREAM is that no one is doing the rest right. SCREAM has managed to be the only successful slasher since everything dried up in the 80s. Why? I hear lots of people blaming this 90s style being all mystery and everything... but... mmm... Friday The 13th was a surprise ending in which a killer was REVEALED and had a speech. The rest were all about Jason. PROM NIGHT was also about a mystery. In fact, audiences seem to be too smart now. I don't think people really know what they want. Or maybe the DO know what the want, and Hollywood just isn't giving it to them. SCREAM gave us an intelligent ending where we went hey! i totally missed that earlier on. Every movie since then has lacked a plot twist that satisfies the audience. (Even the SCREAM sequels).It's very hard to try and move along in this business. I'm trying to be a horror\/thriller\/suspense screenwriter myself and when I wrote a slasher closer to the HALLOWEEN style of okay, we know who the killer is right away... now he's going on a massacre, people were disappointed because there was no mystery. So I rewrote it... and it became PERFECT! Everyone seems to be looking for brain-usage now. I know I do. I like movies where I have to think.Maybe I'm a BIT contradictory there... but I hope some of you know what I mean. It should work both ways, and I'm just proving that 90s slashers aren't the only ones using this who's the killer attitude. Watch THE BONE COLLECTOR or KISS THE GIRLS. The best part of a good murder movie, ANY MURDER MOVIE, is trying to piece together clues. It gives a writer the chance to challenge himself too.That said... I think URBAN LEGENDS FINAL CUT was indeed a poorly knit-together slasher. Good intent and attempt at mystery was there... but COME ON! Read the PRODUCTION NOTES on their website and they sound like they're rehashing every article written when SCREAM came out. And the amazing new concept of seeing movie production - a film within the film to create confusion... and adding comedy to horror for the first time hello? I think SCREAM beat them to both of those things with the ideas expressed in part one, two and ESPECIALLY three. Not to mention one of the last lines in SCREAM 3 (said by Lance Henriksen) ...Final Cut! as a joke to the audience - considering its a horror about a guy with a knife.  The costume is a little bit of a stretch too. Tacky slow camera angles that make it campy... you're like, WAITING for the guy to get bashed over the head rather than watch the thing come flying down at him in slow-mo. And the twin thing? Name me two twins who have the exact same scar on the exact same place on their chin. Shoulda airbrushed that baby off in post production.Last but not least... the whole NEW STORY thing. Works as a movie on its own... they coulda called it FILM SCHOOL and I wouldn't have known it was a sequel to Urban Legend. Does Hollywood not learn? They made the mistake with HALLOWEEN 3, they did it with UL and they're gonna do it with I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER. It's NOT going to get them money! It's okay if you're rakin' it in and you can afford to throw them out there -- but it's not gonna get a new audience in there.Ah, well. Both were filmed here where I live so at least that gives me hope for my own career. *sigh* ","genre":null},{"date":"6 December 2000","score":"","review":"  On the other hand, to those who would knock the movie just because it follows the 90s slasher style, I think it's time to take a step back.

Friday The 13th was a surprise ending in which a killer was REVEALED and had a speech. The rest were all about Jason. PROM NIGHT was also about a mystery. In fact, audiences seem to be too smart now. I don't think people really know what they want. Or maybe the DO know what the want, and Hollywood just isn't giving it to them.

I'm trying to be a horror\/thriller\/suspense screenwriter myself and when I wrote a slasher closer to the HALLOWEEN style of okay, we know who the killer is right away... now he's going on a massacre, people were disappointed because there was no mystery.

The costume is a little bit of a stretch too.

It's the joy of belching loudly at the dinner table,hawking spit off a bridge and watching it plummet into the water, and making endless jokes about your own feces.That joy is best expressed by Adam Sandler's newest film Little Nicky. Its raunchy, goofy, and downright hilarious, but only if you have the stomach and the maturity level to handle it.While most Sandler films are presented in this adolescent ilk, this one is more so, relying on more gross-out jokes than his previous films. It's not that I'm knocking the approach (in fact, I was laughing louder than most people in the audience), it's just that once again, it takes a certain type of individual to enjoy this style of humour.This could be called Adam Sandler's first big budget film, as it relies on special effects and elaborate sets more than his previous ones. Sometimes this approach is effective, such as the superb sets of hell, which are really spooky. However, most of the time it is overdone, substituting style for substance. The great things about films like Happy Gilmore, Billy Madison, and The Waterboy was that the jokes were from the characters and situations, and not from the spectacle on screen. One joke I found particularly unfunny was the addition of breast to the Gatekeeper's (Kevin Nealon) head. Sure you can do it with special effects, but why?Fortunately, Sandler himself is in top-gear, giving a good performance and making up for all the other weak spots of the film. With his bad hair cut and odd speaking voice, Sandler still somehow creates a completely sympathetic and funny character. Personally, I think Adam Sandler's got some acting talent, but only when he's playing a comedic (please forgive his feigned attempt at seriousness in Big Daddy).Sandler has also surrounded himself with an endless list of Saturday Night Live alumni and other famous folks in cameo roles. Dana Carvey, Reese Witherspoon, Jon Lovitz, Henry Winkler, Rodney Dangerfield, Rob Schneider, Clint Howard, Michael McKean, Quentin Tarantino and even Ozzy Ozbourne make appearances.

I'd always thought that thrillers might be great entertainment but couldn't be great movies, yet this one led me to alter my opinion.  The only other ones I can call to mind are the very best Hitchcocks like Vertigo.If you're not American, you might at first imagine that a lot of the movie would be lost on you (Korean war, McCarthy references, Abraham Lincoln).

As we meet Holly Golightly (Hepburn), she appears to be a quirky girl of modest means who yearns to lives the jet set lifestyle.  She window shops at Tiffany's and throws wild parties in her apartment.  Her chief source of income comes from weekly visits to a Mafia don in prison, relaying `weather reports' to his lawyer on the outside.  She seems to be the picture of superficiality, described by O.J. Berman (Martin Balsam) as a `real phony', a person who is not what she appears to be, but is convinced she is.Paul Varjak is an apathetic writer with one book and no ideas.  He moves in upstairs from Holly and they immediately strike up a fire escape friendship.  His only source of income comes from being a gigolo to his wealthy interior decorator (Patricia Neal) who pays him handsomely for his services every chance she gets.  Paul and Holly seem to be two of a kind, abject losers pretending to be what they are not.However, as the story unfolds, the layers are peeled away and the motivation for Holly's go-lightly personality is revealed in her difficult past.  She is far more complex and deep than we first believe, using her lifestyle as a defense mechanism, a way of running from herself.  The friendship and love that grow between Paul and Holly make better people of each and ultimately help them to transcend their personal flaws, but not without great difficulties.For director Blake Edwards, who became most renowned for a spate of Pink Panther movies, this film was probably among his finest moments.  These were complicated characters and he revealed them slowly with nuance.  They were also developing as people and his treatment of this effect was both subtle and powerful.The film is not without controversy.  Truman Capote was adamant about having Marilyn Monroe in the lead, but the studio went with Audrey Hepburn, who was far less popular but who was probably better for the complexities of the character.  They had selected a very young John Frankenheimer as director, who at that point had only TV credits on his resume.  Hepburn refused to work with him and he was dumped in favor of Edwards.  Capote wanted the film to remain true to the book's dark and depressing ending, but the studio chose to play to the masses and end it on an upbeat.  Personally, I'm glad they did.The film has been roundly criticized in the present day for the character portrayed by Mickey Rooney.  Rooney played a caricature of a bumbling Japanese neighbor that was extremely unflattering to Asians although admittedly it was hilarious.  This is considered a shocking portrayal in today's politically correct society, but it stirred little furor at the time, when everyone was far more insensitive and far less oversensitive.  When the film was released, the biggest criticism was that Edwards overused the character to the point of making him nauseating, which was an obvious error in judgment.  If Rooney only had one or two scenes rather than roughly a dozen, it probably wouldn't have become such a lightening rod.Hepburn and Peppard were both terrific in the leads.  Hepburn, who was nominated for best actress for the role, gave Holly a lovable quirkiness that belied her deeper troubles.  When it was time to broaden the character, Hepburn gave her a fullness and depth that I feel Marilyn Monroe never could have accomplished.  Peppard was more than just a dashing and handsome foil for Hepburn.  He played Paul with sensitivity and refinement and had incredible chemistry with Hepburn, making the romance very natural and believable.One of the best things about the film was the soundtrack, which brought the film its only two Oscars from five nominations.  Henry Mancini's musical score was marvelous and film's theme song, `Moon River' written by Henry Mancini and Johnny Mercer is an enduring classic.This richly textured film has both depth and range.  It has just the right balance of lightness and heaviness, with well-explored characters that change before our eyes.  I rated it a 10\/10.  It is an intelligent and affecting film that is worth seeing.

We spent hours picking the scientific and technical gaffes apart after the movie in the Student Coffeehouse.  Although the special effects were often spectacular, the movie dragged for the most part.  The talents of the stars were wasted on one-dimensional characters and a dismal script.  The best part of this movie was likely not intentional.  The movie generated non-stop comments, jokes and ridicule from the audience which reminded me of the best from Mystery Science Theater 3000.  The antics from the audience actually made the movie funny enough to endure.  When Mission to Mars ended, the entire audience yelled in unison, This Movie S**Ks. I agree.  Mission to Mars is an insult to anyone who enjoys good science-fiction.  Although this movie can almost be justified as a vehicle for audience participation, like we had at MIT, such participation is usually frowned upon in a regular public theater.  Therefore, you cannot go to Mission to Mars with the hope that you can revive Mystery Science Theater 3000. I would rate this movie as a 0 out of 10 stars.
