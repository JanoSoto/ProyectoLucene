[{"date":"17 April 2001","score":"","review":"  Disney wouldn't have the BALLS to do this type of movie.  It is one of the most strikingly beautiful animated films ever made.  It is about a little kid who finds a robot who was built as a weapon but with the help of the kid learns he doesn't have to be.  That's a VERY basic description, but it does NO justice to the movie.  There are A LOT of themes to the movie, and a lot of good old fashioned morals.  In addition, this movie is NOT a silly kids-only movie.  Almost anybody can understand the message, and laugh at the antics.  The ONLY problem I have with it is the lack of support it got from Warner.  Come on guys, with this kind of quality, you CAN best Disney no matter WHAT kind of roadblocks they put in front of you.Disney take note, this is a wake-up call.  It is time to produce QUALITY animation, not just something that will sell your merchandise.

As an adult, one can keep laughing during the whole movie. Its really a wellmade, humorous, funny artpiece.Fortunately there is the name 'Disney' to help it, so it had a chance in cinema. I would give respect to any other company which would have made this movie, but only Disney has the name to be successful with movies like this in cinema, as it seems - and even in the case of Disney not always, as the failure of the unbelievable masterpiece 'Toy Story 2' has proved.Well, this is Disney at its best, very good family entertainment for both children and adults, also plus some moral - a really good movie, worth your time !

Instead, we saw The Iron Giant and I was enthralled, at the end I walked out on a cloud of air, rapt in what I had just seen. My sister, however, said it wasn't fast enough and she didn't like it as much as Inspector Gadget!!!This film has stayed with me, it takes the book and works it into a beautiful story with so many hilarious bits. It really made me think about the cold war and weapons etc. I just loved the character of the giant, his eyes were so expressive. I have bought the video, and will force my family to see it as it is something not to be missed.I think it is more of an adults\/ older children's film, because of deeper layers. However, I am sure some kids will love it too. Disney should take note, it is the parents who pay, and maybe they should do a film the parents force their kids to go to, it's so good, example The Iron Giant. 10 out of 10.
