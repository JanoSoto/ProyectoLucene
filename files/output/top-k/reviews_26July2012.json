It's sort of the dictum sometimes when you go backward you go forward (or something like that. The special effects and sets are all top notch because their all practical, you can see they put a heck of a lot of effort into making it, as well as the painful process of construction and reconstruction, but all that pays off. It's cheerful and comical as usual however there is a dark overtone which makes the film take a bit of an unfun turn, but to me that just what makes the film more interesting and make me want the good guys to win because what happens in the film matters.The first act is a lot of fun where we see the future which looks straight out of pulp sci-fi, only it's a reality. It's a bright fun colorful cheerful future some aspects of it slightly prolific on what we have today. There are 80's cafes, hover boards, hollow graphic theaters, electric hover cars, attire that looks a little like 80's fashion only even more colorful, and other things. My favorite thing has always been the power laces, those things are awesome because I wouldn't have to stop and tie my shoes all the time, honestly who wants to and think of the amount of time it takes to do it. My favorite sequence of course is the hover board chase. But there is also a flip side of the coin to this, at the same time it's a slightly dark future because it also shows an America that has completely sold out to consumerism, big products, media, and technology. But the real darkness is when we see the grown up version of Marty, we see how one bad choice has not just made him look older than he really is but has taken away his dignity, musical ability, and reduced him to a brown noser.We then get to the second act when we see the alternate Hill Valley which is a very dark version of their present once Biff manipulates the past with information from the future for his own personal gain, and it's practically looks like Hell on Earth. It's a cesspool of crime and corruption, and there is one moment of dark discovery that made my heart sink. That moment along with seeing the older version of Marty showed how important choices we make in the present really are and they are never without consequences for the future.And of course the final act where we see them back in the same past as the original film. This was an interesting move which I don't see often let alone done well, what made it interesting was that we were seeing the movie in a different perspective this time which has been hidden away from us, sort of non linear story telling style like in Pulp Fiction or the TV show Lost.If the film has a message is that the future truly is in our hands, it can be one way or another.

Yet, when Pelhan returns home to find his lover is pregnant, his home is not built as promised, and his sister has not had her legs fixed, madness and anger drive him to fix all of the problems he has created. After seeing Time of The Gypsies, I felt emotionally saddened that Pelhan, a promising and charming young man, had to suffer from the hand of poverty and ignorance. The director, Kusturica, does an excellent job in portraying his ignorance (Ahmed knows where he hides his money and Ahmed never builds his house or fixes his sister). These sad occurrences are the direct result of a stupid boy whom is raised fatherless and must fall onto the shoulders of an evil and manipulative man. Yet, once again, Kusturica twists with our emotions because the character of Ahmed is at moments caring and helpful towards Pelhan, and at other times, selfish and evil. This sense of moral ambivalence affected me emotionally because I was caught between rooting for the Ahmed, and hating his very guts. The same applies to Pelhan, because at the same time he goes on the road to earn money for his family, but at the same time abandons his sister whom falls prey to Ahmed's child slavery. I believe that the film is trying to tell us that while greed is bad, ignorance is worse. If Pelhan was an educated young man who had not grown up in an impoverished Gypsie town, he could have earned a decent job that would have payed for his sisters operation. Instead, he turned to a child trafficker that lies, steals, and cheats his way to riches. As well, the uncle, Merdzan, plays an important role because his addiction to gambling are the source of problems for the family; he falls debt to Ahmed, destroys the families home, murders Pelhans turkey, and has sex with Pelhans sworn lover. One might even argue that Merdzan is more evil than Ahmed. Maybe, Kusturica was trying to show us that those we hold close hurt us more than the real evil that is portrayed (Such as in the case of Pelhan being fatherless, the Uncle gambling away money, the Grandmother letting Pelhan leave without protest). In fact, most of the characters themselves are weak and incapable of voicing their opinions, leading to more doom and destruction, something that a blend of greed and ignorance will do to a person. The last note I have about the film is its sequences of magical realism. Pelhan, the main character, has telekinetic powers. Khaditza, the grandmother, can curse people. Perhans son can levitate his mothers body into the sky. While these moments may seem unusual and impossible, it is the way Kusturica directs them that makes the moments seem plausible, as if they are natural to the way of life. For instance, while Pelhan has telekinetic powers, nobody really cares about them because they find them harmless and a usual talent -- and in a way, we believe that it is possible, that this universe could easily be ours. What I am trying to get at is through Magical Realism, Kusturica allows viewers to step back and think about the world, and the magical places such as the village in Time of The Gypsies where witches and mind control exist. In fact, it almost seems impossible for it not to exist, for with the amount of weirdness in todays society, one should expect anything.Time Of The Gypsies is not a film for the average viewer. The pacing is slow at times, the language, is well, Romani, and plot has multiple instances of irrationality and impossibility. Yet, pacing and plot aside, the core emotions you feel, and the moral ambivalence that is is projected, overtakes the side steps and makes you think for once about the film you just saw. Who is the true villain, Ahmed or Pelhan. Is everybody set in stone as evil or good. Watch the film to get a new taste of a new world. You won't regret it.

However, I was pleasantly surprised.First off, I think we all know now that director Victor Silva is a convicted child molester. While that is without a doubt awful, he does a great job directing this film. His criminal background shouldn't effect the film he made. I'm not supporting him at all, but I did like this movie.Anyways, the movie starts off extremely chilling and terrifying. The first 15 minutes of this movie will send a chill down your spine. However, once the kids go into the house, the film slowly starts to descend at a slow but sure rate. By the end of the flick, the film is very 'meh', but maybe that's because the film couldn't live up to the beginning. The Creeper, the villain of this horror film, is easily one of the most terrifying villains of horror in a long time. The way he looks, what he wears, his truck, what he does. All of it is horrifying. I proudly tilt my hat to whoever did the makeup design. However, the twist at the end, while definitely unique, kind of takes away from the seriousness the film had. It looked good in Vilva's head and on the storyboards, but when it transferred to screen, it just isn't subtle. As I said, the first third of the film is great. The second third isn't as good, but still manages to keep up the thrills. The climax in the police station is sadly quite boring and loses all the tension the film was building up (despite that the scene involves a massive shootout), but its the VERY ending, the last 2 minutes of the movie that satisfy me. The film in general has a very dark, subtle, and eerie feeling that you just don't see in horror films nowadays. The camera angles are very Evil Dead-esque at times and really add an evil tension to the film.Overall, this is a nicely made horror film with some flaws here and there. If you can get past the directors terrible criminal background, then check out this film. However, I don't recommend the sequel.

The climax in the police station is sadly quite boring and loses all the tension the film was building up (despite that the scene involves a massive shootout), but its the VERY ending, the last 2 minutes of the movie that satisfy me. The film in general has a very dark, subtle, and eerie feeling that you just don't see in horror films nowadays. The camera angles are very Evil Dead-esque at times and really add an evil tension to the film.Overall, this is a nicely made horror film with some flaws here and there. If you can get past the directors terrible criminal background, then check out this film. However, I don't recommend the sequel.

Others have commented that the special effects are pretty bad (true, but I couldn't care less) The real problem here is the script. It takes a really good idea and does almost nothing with it. To start, there really is no backstory for the main character Logan, who in the future dystopian world the characters inhabit, is charged with tracking down, and exterminating people that refuse to submit to the law of the land, namely that you must be sacrificed at age 30. Like I said, a good idea, in theory, but the actors just don't make me care. Michael York as Logan, is a 'Sandman' a man charged with tracking down those unfortunate souls who decide that maybe they don't want to die at 30. Considering life is one big party for the inhabitants of this world, all pleasure all the time, I can see their point! Unfortunately, we get no backstory on these characters! Why were they chosen for these assignments as executioners? What benefit do they get? They also die at 30 so why would they take the assignment?? Well, Logan meets a runner in the form of a beautiful woman Jenny Agutter, and initially is intent on finding her network of cohorts so he can take them all down, but as time passes, his feelings change, and he decides that he wants to live dammit! The movie plods along and eventually comes to an unsatisfying ending. I really can't recommend this one unfortunately however I will say the music is great. A half synthesizer, half orchestra score that is a highlight. If you're looking for a great sic-fi\/end of the world movie, Charlton Heston in 'The Omega Man' is a much better film.

There aren't many to pick from, but it's the kind of choice you're frequently confronted with and says something about who you are; Alien or Aliens? So maybe this is yours. These films, to get into it a bit, are an offshoot of the many sophisticated threads that first came together in film noir (yet others led to Lynch). The most self-evident aspect is that they are detective films, but much more pertinently they are about the effort to see and investigate into a part of your story that you didn't know was so dark. For Clarice, it's the screaming lambs and what it means for her as a person (lamb lost in a callous world). They are about twin-nested-worlds the rational world of cops and forensic experts where the mind attempts control over narrative, and the semiconscious world of urges, self and powerful intuition that makes it all bubble up in the first place.The detective can solve the case because she straddles both.So, these films have power because they're not just about the case or cinematic criminology, that case which is usually wrapped in exotic madness to make you, the viewer, want to keep looking for answers. These answers horrify, assuming we are in sensitive hands, because that madness has, as a fulcrum, actual human beings in pain. We're a long way from Charlie Chan. The difference between detective and killer is not moral right, but having discovered ways to reason with that part of damaged self. Clarice has signed up for the FBI, and the FBI provides a structure (note the staged scenarios in training that allow her to exercise decision-making and control). Our anchor for the entire film is in her world of controlled emotion.Manhunter is my type of film because of a spin that seems very powerful to me; it ever-so-lightly transfers the anchor to the killer, in a way that we understand that that guy breathes and covets in an actual word, and that world has logic of its own, and that logic affects our logic and vision. Because we spend time there in ways that make deep sense, his world of latent visions deepens our own.Demme was not up to it here. So even though well-made, and even though Lecter explains that Buffalo Bill is a child that was hurt, every moment we spend in Bill's world is cheap and sensational. Demme goes to lengths of the silly dance routine in drag, but not so much as a glimpse inside the skin of that man. There is no real shift of vision from the comfortable quest to destroy evil to a more ambiguous nature.We're just not in sensitive hands here. Because we're not, the sense of lurid spectacle spills over the entire thing from Lecter's prison block that looks like a medieval dungeon, to the extended crosscutting between houses in the finale that sensationalizes the bleeding obvious.It's sophisticated and heartfelt on Clarice's end of investigating herself, but on the other end it's a silly potboiler that looks like a Texas Massacre sequel.

Lots of different story lines and characters end up getting intertwined but luckily the movie never becomes a messy or confusing one.It's actually a nice thing the movie has so many different characters in it, with each their own thing happening.

There are one or two allusions to being a made man but the words Mafia and Cosa Nostra never appear, though all the main figures are Italian, observe Italian moral codes, and occasionally lapse into the language of the Old Country. If you really want to be a member of the Goodfellas, it's not enough to be simply part Italian. You need to be ALL Italian, with traceable ancestry to the motherland, preferably Sicily.Everyone except some Federal Agents are corrupt. The wives know what's going on and are often complicit, though they have little to say about business decisions. They're satisfied with the solidarity of the larger family, the special parking places, the secret entrances to the Copacabana, the respect shown themselves and their well-groomed husbands, and the general opulence of their life styles. The girl friends enjoy many of the same privileges but are mainly the subject of jokes, which wives and children are not. Well, some are Madonnas and some are whores.The cops are partners in crime, whether the gangsters are on the streets or in prison. They become your major domos for a few cartons of cigarettes and an occasional big bill tucked into a shirt pocket. Your first jail term turns into a rite of passage, and you're given a celebration before you're packed off. The men clap and cry out Your cherry is broke now. Prison itself is not a bad place if you're a wise guy. No one would dream of trying to rape you. You live with friends and share elaborate dinners and good wines with them.There are only two problems; one is interactional, the other moral and economic.As for the interactional problem, you can never really tell whether someone will become a rat, not even if you've known him all your life. From the point of view of a protagonist like Henry Hill, whose story this is, it's very bad to be a rat instead of a stand-up guy. On the other hand, it's much better to be a rat instead of a dead guy. Severe beatings are common, even for men who are no more than irritating or even for innocents like mailmen. And when an important deal is at stake, whacking is necessary.Whacking is also applied to men who unwisely insult others, because this is a culture of honor. It's like the Old West without Wyatt Earp. When you call me that, smile. And sometimes smiling isn't enough. The derision must be clearly couched. Half a couch may not do.

Peter Parker is bitten by a genetically enhanced spider, and is given spider-like abilities. Parker takes advantage of these abilities by doing good and protecting New York from wrong. But when a villain (nicknamed the Green Goblin) becomes determined to get rid of spidey, Parker has to protect himself, those he loves, and the city of New York.While most action films are soulless excuses for explosions and elaborate fight scenes, Spider-Man is no such film.

It's not excruciatingly dull, but the impatient may find themselves a little squirmy during the first 30-45 minutes. That's okay, because the action really starts picking up after this. There is a very large number of action scenes, and while not all are exciting, they will at least entertain. There are a couple very good and tense action sequences, but the 2-3 inbetween these are usually less entertaining.

And in creating these themes, all he needs are four actresses of impeccable acting skill.Ingmar Bergman is a director unlike any other. He comes from the theatre and as a result transfers theatric style images into his movies. In fact, he is known for his wonderful aesthetic close up shots. In these shots, years of a persons life are viewed, as their facial crevices and deep black eyes are intimately exposed relentlessly. Lets begin with the cinematography. Every scene includes three colors; red, black, and white. Red obviously alludes to dominance and force, a characteristic that haunts Karen and Maria as they each hold their own fiery hatred towards each other. The white represents innocence, possibly strictly for the maid who endlessly cares for Agnus as she dies. At the end of the film, though, her innocence is disrespected and she truly realizes the cruelty of the world, as her help and comfort towards Agnus is dismissed as petty and coming with the job. Lastly, the color black infers death, such as Agnus is enduring through the film, and it sets a bleak resonance in the shots that gives off a gloomy vibe. The acting is utterly impeccable. Hardly does one ever witness so much emotion and character in the faces of Karen and Maria in any film. From their lips, to their wrinkles, to their eyes and bosoms, Karen and Maria only need to be filmed to feed viewers an emotional experience. In fact, Bergman emotionally makes you almost feel suffocated, just as the characters do, as their eyes pierce the camera and their faces fill up the entire screen. You almost wish they would look elsewhere to break the tension, such as in the opening shot where Agnus breathes in pain for nearly three minutes, watching her cry and weep in misery.

","genre":null},{"date":"26 July 2012","score":"","review":" Cries and Whispers directed by Ingmar Bergman, is a fantastic film about that follow themes of the human condition, the face of death, and the meaning of suffering. And in creating these themes, all he needs are four actresses of impeccable acting skill.Ingmar Bergman is a director unlike any other. He comes from the theatre and as a result transfers theatric style images into his movies. In fact, he is known for his wonderful aesthetic close up shots. In these shots, years of a persons life are viewed, as their facial crevices and deep black eyes are intimately exposed relentlessly. Lets begin with the cinematography. Every scene includes three colors; red, black, and white. Red obviously alludes to dominance and force, a characteristic that haunts Karen and Maria as they each hold their own fiery hatred towards each other. The white represents innocence, possibly strictly for the maid who endlessly cares for Agnus as she dies. At the end of the film, though, her innocence is disrespected and she truly realizes the cruelty of the world, as her help and comfort towards Agnus is dismissed as petty and coming with the job. Lastly, the color black infers death, such as Agnus is enduring through the film, and it sets a bleak resonance in the shots that gives off a gloomy vibe. The acting is utterly impeccable. Hardly does one ever witness so much emotion and character in the faces of Karen and Maria in any film. From their lips, to their wrinkles, to their eyes and bosoms, Karen and Maria only need to be filmed to feed viewers an emotional experience. In fact, Bergman emotionally makes you almost feel suffocated, just as the characters do, as their eyes pierce the camera and their faces fill up the entire screen. You almost wish they would look elsewhere to break the tension, such as in the opening shot where Agnus breathes in pain for nearly three minutes, watching her cry and weep in misery.

Dante has been known for making parody films or versions of other films before. Piranha (1978) and Looney Tunes Back In Action (2003) are a couple but what convinced Dante to make a version of Pixar's Toy Story (1995) into something not meant for children confuses me. Dante has a very creative mind yet it's weird that he would create a movie that pertains to children but isn't for them.Small Soldiers is the story of two toy designers' dreams brought to reality; a deadly reality. The two designers, Irwin Wayfair (David Cross) and Larry Benson (Jay Mohr), have created their own action figures. One group is called the Commando Elite, a squad of military tactful individuals who pack quite a punch. The other group is the Gorgonites, a humble race of demonic looking creatures that have no intention of creating war. All they seek is to find their long lost home world, Gorgon.The problem (in the plot) arises when one of the designers decides to implant an advanced military chip into the toys' hardware. But how did he get the rights to obtain that chip? Isn't it top secret or something? Guess the screenwriters missed that loophole. Turns out, this was not the smartest move. Not to mention that their boss, Gil Mars (Denis Leary), wanted to have the Commando Elite programmed to destroy the Gorgonite creatures! It is from there that these toys were shipped to the Abernathy toy store where things start to get out of hand when the toys are activated. What a mess (in a good way)!There's a small love story among the chaos that occurs through the story. The son of the Abernathy family, Alan (Gregory Smith), falls for his next door neighbor Christy Fimple (Kirsten Dunst). It's cute and makes the story slightly more amiable. The main attraction here though are the voice actors and action sequences.The majority of the voice cast for the Commando Elite was taken from The Dirty Dozen (1967), with Ernest Borgnine as Kip Kiligan. The leader is Chip Hazard voiced by the recognizable Tommy Lee Jones who sounds perfect for the role. Frank Langella voices the character of Archer, the leader of the Gorgonites. Langella is good because he makes Archer sound noble and trustworthy. My favorite Gorgonite was Insaniac, a purple crazed-eye huge grinning fast-talking blabbermouth who spins around like Taz from Looney Tunes. This guy has too many funny lines. And who voiced him? None other than Michael McKean from Short Circuit 2 (1988).Jerry Goldsmith composed the soundtrack for the movie and it sounds great as usual. It's hard to find a movie that Goldsmith doesn't produce good music to. What can be considered a turn-off is the action. I loved the action but for others it may be too violent or demented. Some people may associate it as being a dark toned Toy Story (1995) film and in this case, they're right. Some of the contents here are not for children because it really is...well violent.Small Soldiers lives up to its name for having the action it says it has. However, it may be too violent for younger audiences. Besides this though, the music is good and so is the acting.
