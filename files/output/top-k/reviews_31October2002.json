Brendan Fraser does a pretty good job, but he's had better gig's.  Steve Buscemi is very good as always (I don't know why, but I really like Steve's acting).  Adam Sandler is great and ropes in a lot of laughs.  Chris Farley does a great job!  Other notable cast members are Michael Richards, Michael McKean, Judd Nelson, Ernie Hudson, Joe Mantegna, David Arquette, Harold Ramis, and the band members of White Zombie.  I'm a huge fan of White Zombie\/Rob Zombie and it was pretty cool to see them in the film.All in all, the film is good, but not excellent.

This movie is a true gore fest, but not one played for camp or entertainment...frankly, it is just disturbing, and that is saying a lot from a movie lover who loves films such as Dawn of the Dead and the Evil Dead trilogy.  Like Freddy Kruger, The Wishmaster is a villain you truly despise since he seems to have no weaknesses and traps his victims' wishes in pretty devious manners.  I guess, as a horror film fan, that is a good thing for effect, but the movie itself, despite a pretty original idea, has the same theme spawn over and over again throughout the film (a dimwitted person makes a wish, sometimes in the context of harmlessness towards a complete stranger -The Wishmaster- and totally regrets it afterwards).  It does get rather tiring afterawhile.Kudos to Wes for including pretty much every cult B-Movie icon in this movie.  We have Robert Englund (Freddy Kruger), Ted Raimi (Horror film stock actor who is Sam Raimi's real life brother who (Sam Raimi) is the director of Evil Dead movies and Spiderman), Kane Hodder (Jason Vorhees in parts 7-10 of Friday the 13th), Reggie Bannister (Badass undead slayer of the four Phantasm films), Angus Scrimm giving the prologue dialogue (The Tall Man of Phantasm), Tony Todd (The Candyman) and I could've sweared that Bruce Campbell made an appearance at the end as a magician looking killer who cut some guy's head off...maybe it was just my imagination.  But, it was a delight to see all of these familiar faces especially Reggie Bannister since I had rented Phantasm II along with this one.Overall, not bad, but I must warn you, it is gory, without remorse or pity, very dark and sinister, and in a way claustrophobic.  You feel like you can never get away from this guy, no matter what, though I would've wished his ass to be destroyed and no more further harm caused to others and all past harm remedied.  It's definitely not a bad film, since it does provide these feelings, though unpleasant, that's what we want from a horror film, right? Kinda sorta...none of these feelings are 'scares' which is what we crave...we just see some supernatural being slaughter endless people in response to peoples' wishes.  And why the main character had to be the one to give all three wishes still baffles me.  And how this one slipped by the nazi MPAA ratings baffles me as well.  The gore in this one is disturbing...not campy...just a fair warning.I add one whole star to this one due to the many cameos in it.  An okay movie with an interesting premise, but it is redundant after the first 20 minutes.  For true gore and mayhem lovers only.  6\/10 stars.

This movie is a true gore fest, but not one played for camp or entertainment...frankly, it is just disturbing, and that is saying a lot from a movie lover who loves films such as Dawn of the Dead and the Evil Dead trilogy.  Like Freddy Kruger, The Wishmaster is a villain you truly despise since he seems to have no weaknesses and traps his victims' wishes in pretty devious manners.  I guess, as a horror film fan, that is a good thing for effect, but the movie itself, despite a pretty original idea, has the same theme spawn over and over again throughout the film (a dimwitted person makes a wish, sometimes in the context of harmlessness towards a complete stranger -The Wishmaster- and totally regrets it afterwards).  It does get rather tiring afterawhile.Kudos to Wes for including pretty much every cult B-Movie icon in this movie.  We have Robert Englund (Freddy Kruger), Ted Raimi (Horror film stock actor who is Sam Raimi's real life brother who (Sam Raimi) is the director of Evil Dead movies and Spiderman), Kane Hodder (Jason Vorhees in parts 7-10 of Friday the 13th), Reggie Bannister (Badass undead slayer of the four Phantasm films), Angus Scrimm giving the prologue dialogue (The Tall Man of Phantasm), Tony Todd (The Candyman) and I could've sweared that Bruce Campbell made an appearance at the end as a magician looking killer who cut some guy's head off...maybe it was just my imagination.  But, it was a delight to see all of these familiar faces especially Reggie Bannister since I had rented Phantasm II along with this one.Overall, not bad, but I must warn you, it is gory, without remorse or pity, very dark and sinister, and in a way claustrophobic.  You feel like you can never get away from this guy, no matter what, though I would've wished his ass to be destroyed and no more further harm caused to others and all past harm remedied.

She gets him to rob from his bank to pay for her rent in a nice condo she shares with her lover, Duryea, who's looking like a perfect dandy in his one dollar brim round hat. Lang and associates pull off the visual elements very well -- excellent photography. This movie came out in the mid 40s, and although I doubt it exactly cheered those audiences up, they sure got a good show for their money for once.p.s. 2008 -- still just gotta love Dan Duryea in that dandy hat. The movie reminded my friend of a horror film, and there are indeed moments especially towards the end where it has moments of outright horror, with Robinson's character haunted by the ghosts of his conscience. It's a bit heavy handed there, but it does allow for a different kind of fall-out than the typical end that befalls a transgressor in movies. It reminds me of Fury, really getting inside someone's head and literally showing the manifestations of his guilt. What I like best about the film is the whole element of her stealing his art, taking on the identity of the artist. You put that together with the kind of pimp\/prostitute relationship she has with the Duryea character and it's an interesting triangle. You have her taking on his identity, the self portrait that becomes central as an image. Then you have Duryea eventually taking on Robinson's role as the guilty party in the murder. It's tragic in a way that even though he's now recognized as a great artist, his subterfuge with the girl has made it impossible to claim them as his even after she betrays him. No wonder his name is Chris Cross! I absolutely love all the performances here. Bennett isn't usually a favorite of mine necessarily but she is just perfect for this role for some reason. It's the way she seems to adopt a feeling for each scene the way a woman in real life would put on a dress or a hat. You always wanted to be an actress, as Johnny tells her. She and Chris get to live out their dreams in an odd way, Chris becoming a great artist and she living a role that is in itself a performance. But they can't enjoy the fruits of those dreams because to reveal the truth would destroy them.

The movie that literally invented the slasher genre, inspired countless knockoffs and a seemingly infinite slew of sequels that we have all taken our pain and pleasure in. Halloween is my favorite movie of all-time, period. The first time I watched it, I was 9 years old, and it affected me so deeply. For a period of time whenever I would close my eyes, I saw that white face. Halloween, by today's standards, may look like a rather weak film. MTV junkies and fast food zombies raised on Scream will no doubt be turned off by this film. You have to view this film in the context of what time period it came out in. In 1978, this film sent a shiver down everyone's spine. In the wake of the splatterfest Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Wes Craven's excessive torture flick, Last House on the Left, Halloween was a film that depended less on gore and more on mood. What makes Halloween so special is the sense of vulnerability felt throughout the entire 90 minutes. One scene in particular that I will remember for the rest of my life is the scene with Laurie in the dark bedroom, standing next to a darkened, open closet-way. As the light slowly starts to fade in, we see a white mask suddenly appear, and it is none other than Michael Myers (really, it's a scene you have to see to understand). Also, the music must be mentioned, as it just heightens the experience. John Carpenter's score for this movie has seen as many knock-offs as the actual film itself. Character development is also another key element to what makes this film work. We spend the first 45 minutes getting to know the leading lady, Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis' first movie role, she obviously went on to become one of the biggest actresses of her generation). After a while, we really start to feel for the character and actually CARE when she is in danger (a major opposition to Friday the 13th flicks, where Jason was the anti-hero). Halloween gets by without a lot of gore. Sometimes what we don't see is more. Despite what some people might say, I think this film has stood the test of time (I'm not biased, I wasn't alive when this came out, I'm only 18, and even I can recognize the true suspense of it).

It's not bad, and certainly entertaining, but does it deserve to be ranked as high on the IMDb rankings as it is? In my opinion, not a chance, although I was starting to wonder if I was the only one who felt this way.This film is, among other things, a satire that pokes fun at stuff like support groups, mindless consumerism and overall social conformity (although my view is `American Psycho' did a much better job with the latter two issues). It stars Edward Norton as `Jack'; a corporate drone who, to borrow an overused cliché, basically has no life. Giving credit where due, he is perfect for the role, with a face and personality that, if he were involved in a crime or accident, eyewitnesses would invariably describe as `average'. But all this changes when he meets a rather unusual fellow flying home from a business trip. Tyler Durden, soap salesman (among other occupations) is everything Jack isn't - unconventional, brash, impulsive and seemingly fearless. The two hook up, with Jack feeding off Tyler's manic energy, and their very first night together Tyler suggests they start a fistfight just for the hell of it. Afterward, they both revel in the exhilaration of the experience (neither man had ever been in a fight before) and in due time they form `Fight Club', hence the title of the movie. What is `Fight Club'? It's an underground organization where young men fight each other as a form of therapy, or to just give them something exciting to relieve their otherwise dull and pointless lives. Jack's personality changes to more closely resemble Tyler's, he becomes more confident, in fact, downright aggressively so, as shown in a scene where he blackmails his boss about halfway through the film. Eventually the two's ambitions outgrow Fight Club, and they plan something much bigger, namely Project Mayhem, a plot to bring down major companies nationwide, all of which culminates in a somewhat bizarre plot twist at the end, one which will go unmentioned since it shows the actual nature of Jack and Tyler's `partnership' and is thus a major spoiler. Is this movie worth watching? It definitely is energetic and imaginative, but it's also chock full of pretentious pop philosophy, with dialog like `The things you own end up owning you' and `It's only after we have lost everything that we are free to do anything'. It might fulfill every closet anarchist's fantasies about `bringing down the system', but in the end, it is simply about the substitution of one kind of conformity for another. The members of Fight Club and, later, Project Mayhem, are, in reality, far more robotic than the `corporate clones' this movie purportedly makes fun of. Tyler is just another example of an infantile jerk being made into some sort of existential hero simply because he's a non-conformist, not because he actually has anything worthwhile to say. Once you get past the bravado, you find there's really nothing there. Thanks to Tyler, Jack may have found a passion and a purpose in life, but not for doing anything that actually makes the world a better place. In short, this film lacks the courage to rise above the morass of cynicism and nihilism that unfortunately has too strong a grip on modern American culture. As noted, this movie is not without its good points, the acting is uniformly solid, it throws some intriguing ideas at us, but its `message' ultimately falls flat.6\/10  ","genre":null},{"date":"31 October 2002","score":"1 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":"  I was pleased to see that Roger Ebert only rated this movie two stars.

Once you get past the bravado, you find there's really nothing there. Thanks to Tyler, Jack may have found a passion and a purpose in life, but not for doing anything that actually makes the world a better place. In short, this film lacks the courage to rise above the morass of cynicism and nihilism that unfortunately has too strong a grip on modern American culture. As noted, this movie is not without its good points, the acting is uniformly solid, it throws some intriguing ideas at us, but its `message' ultimately falls flat.6\/10  ","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"31 October 2002","score":"2 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":"  Strange Days which was written in 1995 gives us a view into the not so distant future of 5 years ahead, which many films do not. Computer technology has put out a new virtual reality product called a SQUID that directly interlocks itself with the user's visual nerves, whatever they see is recorded. The SQUID in this movie isn't the main deal, it's a tool used for uncovering one of the biggest cover-ups the nation has seen in many years. After two renegade cops kill an outspoken rapper in a routine traffic stop, two passengers riding with the rapper bail out and run for help, one of them wearing a SQUID and capturing every moment on tape. If the tape gets out it would cause a nation-wide riot. Just happens to be that the person who recorded the incident is a friend of a VR dealer named Lenny Nero (Ralph Finnes).The movie compels you to watch every second. Where the story begins to fade James Cameron gives you some action sequences and even nudity just to keep the viewer watching. One of the greatest science fiction stories ever told because of the type of people the movie deals with, these people who can make or break the fate of a nation on the most uncertain day for people in thousands of years, Y2K.Strange Days has many subplots that don't make very much sense, like the relationship between Ralph Finnes and Juliete Lewis, the relationship could have been forgone, and nobody would have missed it. It's never really explained why Lenny's best friend played by Tom Sizemore turns into such an evil character (the guy is serial killer with a twist of pure evil, and I mean pure evil.) Yet, the movie is so great you won't care about any of that.Strange Days is a must see for anyone, not just science fiction fans. If you like Ralph Finnes work you'll like it, if you have ever witnessed a James Cameron film and liked it just a little, you'll love this film. Compelling from start to end, Strange Days is a modern work of art that is and probably will stay an under-rated piece of work.Reviewer's Personal Note I like to clap out loud at movie theaters or watching one at home if I really enjoyed it. I watch about a movie every other day, and I hadn't had a movie to clap for, for about a couple of months, after this one was done, the whole story flashed threw my mind as I realized how great it was. I clapped twice, near the end, and after the credits. Don't rent it, go buy it.

And surprise, it was the hit they wanted it to be.  Take a closer look and you will realize this is more than a teen vampire movie.  The key word here is TEEN.  This films central theme is not vampires, but it's about enjoying the pleasures of youth.  The films title, in case you don't know, is borrowed from Peter Pan's gang, The Lost Boys, who were a bunch of kids who could never grow old.  In this film, The Lost Boys are a gang of teen vampires who could never grow old.  The story, in more than one way, does resemble Peter Pan, largely with the aforementioned themes of youth.This theme is realized here but it's also clear that some people won't get that, so I'll open you up to it a little. One example would be, with the exceptions of Dianne Weist, Edward Herrmann, and Barnard Hughes, why do you hardly see any other adults in Santa Carla?  Also during the concert scene, the only people you see are teenagers.  Not a single adult is seen.  This leads to the speculation that Santa Carla may in fact, be a haven for teenagers who could have possibly run away from home, are lost, or are looking for something to do with their lives, while they're still young.  Santa Carla does in several ways resemble Neverland.  Neverland was populated by nothing but kids and despised any adults who came to their land.  Another example would be Dianne Weist's romance with Barnard Hughes.  When they first meet, she says that We were that age once.  It is also evident that between these two, they may be trying to relive the younger, happier days of their lives.A final example would be the Lost Boys themselves.  David (Kiefer Sutherland), the gang's confident leader, seems to obviously like the fact that he's a vampire.  In fact, he embraces it, something that any kid would love.  All they do basically is ride bikes, sleep, party, and drink blood; all things that any teenager in his position would do.           It's also a coming-of-age story too.  Michael (Jason Patric) is also probably beginning to experience love for the first time in his life.  He pines for Star (Jami Gertz), who is the only girl in David's gang.  But his need for blood also seems to be getting in the way of that though.  His younger brother, Sam (Corey Haim) is too young to be experiencing love.  (He's still into comic books and things like that).  Also Michael joins David's gang, something that many teenagers when they're young, would do.  To have a sense of belonging and making new friends, I think is Michael's ultimate goal.Apparently, some people have missed that point entirely by thinking that this is just another 80's vampire movie.  On the contrary, I think that the 80's setting perfectly fits this movies material.  I think, that had this film been released in 1997, ten years after its release, the outcome would have been very different.  Had it been, this film would probably          have been filled with the sex, drugs, and gory violence that seems to inhabit most of today's teen movies.

Matt is a doctor and Ruth is a music teacher and one summer their lives change drastically when their only child Frank comes home for the summer before leaving for graduate school and falls in love with an older woman, Natalie Strout, who is a single mother in the midst of a nasty divorce with her husband Richard. Richard is furious at Natalie because he says that she took his house, his kids and is even more infuriated with her for being involved with Frank. Richard's anger sets off a chain of events that no one would have thought possible at the start of the summer.Sissy Spacek received critical acclaim for her portrayal of Ruth Fowler and despite a weak screenplay she manages to make her character extremely believable, which helps the audience be sympathetic to her as her world starts to crumble around her, which not a lot of actresses would be able to achieve. Spacek's performance got her an Academy Award nomination for best actress, an Actors Guild Nomination for best actress and a Golden Globe for best actress in a motion picture drama. My personal opinion is that Spacek's portrayal as Ruth Fowler was one of the best performances of the year and I doubt that many other actresses would have been able to play Ruth Fowler as brilliantly as what Spacek did. Tom Wilkinson's portrayal of Matt Fowler saw him receive glowing reviews and an Academy Award Nomination for best actor. Although he received such good reviews and the Oscar Nomination I thought that his character's denial of certain events was slightly unbelievable therefore made it hard for me as the audience to feel sympathetic towards him; Matt Fowler also seemed oblivious to his crumbling marriage and as a result of this I found it a lot easier to feel sorry for Ruth than Matt.Nick Stahl as Frank Fowler was fantastic, he was also one of the only fresh faces in the cast therefore he didn't receive much credit for his portrayal of this eager young adult. Although he was only in the movie for the first three quarters his character was pivotal to the plot. Frank Fowler's love for Natalie Strout was the part of the story that set the ball rolling and was the reason that such tragic circumstances occurred.Marisa Tomei's performance as Natalie Strout also saw her receive glowing reviews and an Academy Award Nomination for best supporting actress and a Golden Globe Nomination for best supporting actress in a motion picture drama but I don't believe that she deserved them because her portrayal of this single mother was laboured and could have been performed just as well if not better than half the young actresses in Hollywood. Natalie Strout's reaction to certain events was somewhat unbelievable so it was difficult for me to sympathise with her. Marisa Tomei and Nick Stahl played two people who were supposed to be madly in love with each other but I didn't think that there was much chemistry between them whereas the chemistry between Sissy Spacek and Tom Wilkinson as Ruth and Matt Fowler was evident and you could tell that the characters were indeed very much in love.I think that Nick Stahl and Sissy Spacek's performance was one of the reasons that the movie received such acclaim and didn't sink at the box office. Although the plot was original I found the screenplay to be slightly too thin and weak it also takes the first three quarters of the movie to actually get into it and a lot of people would have already switched off by then.

Starring a genius mathematician who has found the numerical key to the stock market, Pi takes you on a wild black and white adventure through his struggle against forces who want to use his discovery for their own purposes. Aronofsky's style becomes evident throughout the film as he uses not only the obvious black and white color scheme, but unique editing and camera techniques that contribute to a kind of surreal atmosphere and the very distinct feel of Pi. The first question is why did Aronofsky choose to go black and white?  I think black and white has two major advantages.  First of all, now that Hollywood color cameras have become so good, modern color films please the eye but look less realistic.  They are saturated with bright, vibrant colors that make evident the use of predetermined lighting setups and look too crisp and beautiful to be real.  This can be avoided by reverting to black and white as Aronofsky did.  Secondly, if used deftly, black and white brings out the contrast of lights and darks, which looks more visually appealing.  Photographers often shoot in black and white because it brings out this pure contrast, without the viewer being fixated on color, and Aronofsky follows suit.  We best see the beauty of black and white in the opening scene, when Max is lying face-down on his desk.  The shadows on his face stand out against his silvery eyelid, which is the only moving thing in the picture. This image feels and looks very attractive, and hooks the viewer in so that he is interested in what this film is about. I think the use of black and white was successful with Pi. Besides the black and white color scheme, Aronofsky uses original editing techniques in Pi.  Whenever Max Cohen, the protagonist, takes his pills, we hear the cap on the pill container popping, him saying things like `200mg penicillin, marinol, 1mg dihydrogen mezolate.', fast-paced techno music, and the pills as they are swallowed.  We see flashing, fast-cut  images of pills being taken.  This scene is repeated throughout the movie and serves as a kind of constant repetition that keeps the viewer familiar and in rhythm with the movie.  Another example of Aronofsky's inventive editing is the scene in the subway, when Max pokes his own brain with a pencil. Every time he touches the brain, a sharp, high pitched buzzing noise ensues and the screen flashes white.  After a while, the white screen dissolves into an image of an oncoming subway train.  This scene provokes a kind of disgusted, `weirded-out' reaction in the viewer that could not have been created had it not been for Aronofsky's editing.  The editing of Pi contributes to its very different feel, and both the pills and the brain scene add to what makes this film different from any modern Hollywood thriller. A particular scene that I find demonstrates great mis-en-scene is the one in the subway, when Max is walking hesitantly towards what seems to be his own brain sitting on the stairs.  It is set up symmetrically, and the ceiling supports on either side of Max vanish into a very clear, even horizon line.  It is at first a long shot, where we can see Max's hesitant movements and body language from a distance.  The white pillars in the subway station contrast sharply with the dark floor.  Then, as Max moves forward, we can distinguish his features and the screen becomes black with his jacket and pants, and when he kneels down to examine the brain, his face is lit strongly by studio lights.  All the while, suspenseful synthesizer rhythms are playing in the background. This scene has a bizarre atmospheric tone to it, and is very characteristic of the entire film. The great mis-en-scene and editing of Pi fit it into the Formalist category.  Although the action scenes, such as the one where Max chases a photographer out the subway and into the street, are shot with a shaky camera, every angle seems calculated to provide exciting visuals rather than to document events realistically.  When the movie mellows out, such as in the numerous scenes in Max's apartment, the camera rarely moves.  Instead of panning around, Aronofsky simply changes our view of the action.  This is more quiet and subtle, instead of having so much Blair Witch-esque movement. Also, the fast cuts in the pill scenes were definitely predetermined and Formalist.  Overall, I think Pi is well put together and that its Formalist shots are beautiful. Pi is a great example of the best things that come from low budget independent movie making. Aronofsky proves to us that ideas are more important than money, and good acting more interesting than special effects. It's a pity mainstream Hollywood ignores this time and time again.  With its grainy, flashing, black and white textures, beautifully put together scenes, and fresh editing techniques, Pi is an innovative masterpiece of underground film.
