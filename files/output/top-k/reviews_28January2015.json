Armour of God is one of the silliest movies I ever had to pleasure of watching. Where else will you see Chinese people in tight 70s suits with 80s hair and eyes wide open as if trying not to be Asian as well as machine gun wielding monks? Early in the movie there is a shootout scene and it is an absolutely amazing piece of work. A bunch of monks gun down a lot of people while a cheesy 80s pop song is being sang in the background and they do the killing in a choreographed manner, loosely to the beat of the song. Oh you have to see it, it is glorious. And all of that unnecessary effort is only to kidnap someone in order to make the main character do something for them that they do not want to pay for. That's the premise, people. And this goody light-headedness is how the whole story is treated.Of course many people watch Jacky Chan for the acrobatics and yes, the fight choreography as well as various driving stunts are very good. The characters travel to a lot of different places and it is fun to travel with them. The visuals are memorable.The things worth liking about this movie, besides the silly antics of Jacky Chan, are rather superficial and depend a lot on the viewer's taste. The main female lead, played by Lora Forner, is very pretty, possibly the prettiest actress I have seen on film except for Zeta-Jones. The car Jacky Chan drives looks cool and has gadgets. Finally, the song when the credits start rolling is pretty good, in a typical cheesy 80s kind of way (you have to get the right version of the film as there are several versions of the credits song).All of the above things combined with the silly overacting and violence makes this a movie for kids, which is why it has taken a special place in many young men's hearts, at least in the East (Russia specifically). Think about it, the makers are almost going down a checklist hot chick, fast car, violence, adventure, jumping around and silly acting with slapstick &#x96; all the things boys are into.The dialogue can be really poor. Of course, there is always a possibility that it the subtitles are just bad and it works better in Cantonese, which is the language the movie is in, but I doubt it because the writing is just too shallow and the acting that accompanies it is just too silly and physical.The acting&#x85;gosh. Jacky Chan tries, but sometimes he fails. Alan Tam, who plays a singer, and is a singer in real life, is a much better actor in this. He overacts, but it works, and it is to him that we owe the catchy though cheesy tunes in this movie.I feel like I like this movie for all the wrong reasons, but I still like it.

His other works include Transformers and Armageddon. Pearl Harbor scored four Academy Award nominations in the technical categories and won one of them. However, that is almost the only positive thing I can say about it. This film which runs for over 3 hours had just too many parts that added really nothing and just made it very boring to watch. The occasional parts of humor (I lick you instead of I like you) did not work at all and even if (or maybe as) the script came from the writer of Braveheart, the screenplay did not seem particularly refined.The first 30 minutes of the film are about the relationship between Affleck's and Beckinsale's characters. They fall in love, but he goes to war right afterward. We see lots of battle scenes next, especially with planes and it slowly moves towards the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. What I found strange though was how the scenes that involved the Japanese generals talking about the attack felt so unconnected to the action including Affleck and Hartnett as if it were two different films. Then there were also unrealistic scenes, like Cuba Gooding Jr. beating up a white man in a fight after he got beaten up completely before. A few words changed the outcome? Not gonna happen. By the way, Gooding Jr. already was an Academy Award winner when this was made and so was Affleck. He got his second not too long ago, again not for acting, but Hartnett, a big prospect almost 15 years ago, has become pretty irrelevant by now and is back to television work, even if that, with the great state TV is in these days, that isn't even a negative thing.But back to the movie. One of its biggest problems is that none of the characters were particularly likable, especially not Affleck's. Another criticism is that the acting simply isn't good. Those who give solid performances (like Alec Baldwin, Michael Shannon) only play minor parts or roles which they usually play, like in Baldwin's case an authority figure. So yeah, after 48 minutes, Affleck's character is already dead (seemingly) and I felt the speech that Hartnett's character gives at the funeral is something that did not come off as authentic, maybe because I never really felt the two had such a strong best friend connection.Also I have to say that I was not even wowed by the special effects and other technical aspects of the film. Maybe that came because the drama and relationship aspects weren't interesting. It's all style over substance, even if the Academy begs to differ. There was one scene when Japanaese planes fire at a car with the two protagonists in, but all of a sudden stop firing. I did not understand why as the car obviously was still driving, so somebody in there must have been alive. I guess there are more plot holes in this movie if you took a closer look for them. That is just one that I remembered. Also, with what the United States did to Japan later on, the film was slightly too patriotic for my taste.To end the review on a more positive note, I would like to say that I liked the song There You'll Be and I would not have minded it winning the Oscar. However, as a whole I cannot recommend watching this film. Looking at the fact that it ended up among the 10 most seen films from 2001 at the box office, far too many watched it already in proportion to its (lack of) quality.

I liked this movie because of the storyline and the interpretation of Matthew Modine who played as Pvt. J.T. 'Joker' Davis. Another interpretation that had to be mentioned is the interpretation of Vincent D'Onofrio who played as Pvt. Leonard 'Gomer Pyle' Lawrence and he was really good at it. About the direction of Stanley Kubrick I have to say that for one more time was magnificent.Finally I believe that Full Metal Jacket is a great movie that shows some of the events that took place in the war of Vietnam and make us think of them. Also this movie shows us all of that from a different angle than the other movies and this is the interesting part of this movie.

There is nothing superlative about it in any regard. That said, it is by no means poorly done or unenjoyable. In some ways it's designed in a Lowest Common Denominator style (or one size fits all if that makes more sense), but essentially it hovers a little bit above mediocrity. You have good actors that have a fairly good script to work with and the product comes out as a general crowd pleaser. The comedy, though undeniably slapstick throughout, has some variety to it. This is mostly because the majority of the gags and screen time in general are split between David Spade and Chris Farley. Even in the situations where both of their characters are involved, we get different styles of comedy. The humor definitely deserves it's PG-13 certification, but there's plenty of clean humor mixed in as well. There's a fair amount of recurring gags with Tommy (Chris Farley) being klutzy and overweight, but there is also enough verbal comedy to entertain those who don't enjoy the former style, again showing that this movie was likely made with an LCD mentality. Also, there are a fair amount of laughs that come from small, nameless characters that Tommy and Richard (David Spade) meet along the way.The story, like most of the movie, is satisfactory, but unremarkable for the most part. From what I've heard, the business comedy idea is not a new one, so the storyline doesn't score any points for originality. Still, it progresses naturally and isn't hard to follow, though there are a couple of twists along the way. There are no hidden morals or deep concepts like in John Hughes movies. It ends in a sort of happily ever after, but this is presented in a sort of mocking way. The villains are, again, satisfactory, though unremarkable and get relatively little screen time. Besides, it's a comedy so most viewers probably care more about the journey rather than the outcome.The execution is alright, though it doesn't need much attention considering that it's a comedy. The acting is pretty good, and, as stated before, they are given a pretty good script and characters.If you like road trip comedies like Planes, Trains, and Automobiles, or The Great Outdoors, this is worth a shot. I wouldn't recommend going out to spend money on it, but if you can't find anything else worth watching, give it twenty minutes and enjoy if you can. Overall Rating 8.3\/10.

However, I'll make an exception here because I visited and lived in Thailand for a total of nearly 4 years.It's difficult to make a judgment about this film because there are so many ways to look at it.For example, the story of Anna Leonowens is very basically true. She was the teaching governess of King Mongkut's children, and she certainly had a significant influence on Prince (and later) King Chulalongkorn; during a visit to Europe as an adult, he visited her long after her departure from Siam\/Thailand. However, it is very unlikely that she had any undue influence on old King Mongkut, and it was certainly nothing like this film (or The King & I) portrays. There is little, if any, evidence that there was a concubine named Tuptim or that that subplot has any truth to it. Nevertheless, it's a fun story to see...as fiction often is. Here I would say 30% history, 70% fiction. Additionally, I may be wrong, but I don't recall in Thai history King Mongkut's brother being killed as depicted in the film.In terms of the sets, the film must be judged very differently. They are magnificent and, for the most part, remarkably accurate. King Mongkut's throne room was not that large, but aside from that I would have to give the sets an A+.On the other hand, in terms of settings, the producers and directors were not as accurate. I've been most of the places depicted here, and other than in the Three Pagoda Pass and Nong Khai, all the other sites (Bangkok\/Krung Thep; the seaside palace; and Anna's house) there are NO mountains, just the flat flood plain of the Chao Phrya River.But, while I am not fluent in Thai, I speak a bit of it, and much of the dialog was very well spoken Thai language. Some of the extras did not look Thai to me.Jodie Foster did a fine job of Anna Leonowens. Some have criticized her British accent, and I can't speak to that. But her acting was very good. Chow Yun-Fat, as King Mongkut, was fine, although if you look up photos of King Mongkut, you'll find he was actually a very homely man (and that's putting it politely).

Inception, Memento, Donnie Darko, etc. Granted they are complex and puzzling films but I don't find them THAT puzzling. Maybe it's that I rarely watch any awful movie and that I'm the only teenager alive to see great movies that no man\/woman has sadly gone before (RIP, Brain cells). But one day, a friend of mine and I watched The Game. It actually turned out to be a great movie. But I'm surprised to hear that nobody has talked about it. What's the story?Nicolas Van Orten (Michael Douglas) is a banker living a wealthy but awful life, traumatized by the death of his father and being recently divorced by his wife. On his birthday, his brother Conrad (Sean Penn) gives Nicolas a voucher to CRS, where he can participate in an event known as The Game. Nicolas, at first refuses, but decides to go to CRS anyway and do the Game. After that visit, he returns home only to find a marionette containing a key and a talking television who starts to explain the rules of the Game. Soon after, some really weird sh*t is happening to him (You'll have to see for yourself to find out) and decides to find answers on what is happening to his life and it's a trip to the edge of insanity to find out before his life is fully broken down.Why is it good?1. It keeps you guessing until the end. The Game is a huge maze of a movie. Like what is does to Nicolas, it messes with your mind and leaves your jaw dropped to the very bottom. I'm not going to spoil them for you, but these moments have a very Kubrickian or Hitchcockian vibe to them. You constantly repeat yourself What is happening? What is this building up to? And what is the purpose of the Game? None of these are answered for you until you finished the journey. These are confusing moments, but they have unpredictably and they are closely related to moments of Nicolas' life. That's what made the Game work, It's finding answers that are the objective, not how to find them.2. It's beautiful. David Fincher is considered as the modern-day Stanley Kubrick. After seeing 4 of his films, I can agree with that notion. The plot has a Hitchcockian feel, but the visuals feel like it was directed by Kubrick himself. Every shot in the film is important and they experiment with different camera techniques and colour schemes for certain scenes. Thanks to Fincher and DP Harris Salvades, they managed to make the Game look beautiful. God bless them both.3. Michael Douglas's performance. The rest of the performances are either OK or good. Sean Penn and Deborah Kara Unger did very well in the film. But it's Douglas who steals the show. He takes a character who tries to move away from the traumatic events in his life and brings him into something he never experienced before. He has a lot of effort and soul into his performance. I love how he transitions from a normal, private banker hating his life to a man desperately searching for the answers who has mind screwed up. You start out hating him, but learn to sympathize with him as the Game progresses. It's definitely one of the best performances I've ever seen and deserves a look.4. It is well-plotted. Everything is in it's right places, even if there are a few plot holes (though I don't think of plot-holes often). But it is a stellar plot. Everything is well-timed and precise. And the moments aren't being random for the sake of being random. They are related to Nicolas' life and have subtle foreshadowing on what's to come. Truly the writers deserve an Oscar because they know how to plot a story precisely. Overall, a great film. It's Hitchcock and Kubrick for the price of one.

It would open in Western Europe in early December, in time for Christmas. The world was in no mood for a court in the United States to declare that there is no Santa Claus. Besides the loss of loved ones in the war, the U.S. and other countries had endured years of rationing, sacrifice and going without. The post-war economies were gearing up, people had jobs and money to spend, and families that had gone without now could buy holiday meals and gifts for everyone. The screenplay of Miracle on 34th Street doesn't say anything about all of this. But, it is implied and it was surely understood by the movie audiences that watched the film on its release in 1947. Keeping that in mind today will help one understand the commercialization aspects the movie addressed at that time. Interestingly, Valentine Davies wrote the story for the movie in 1944 while serving in the U.S. Coast Guard. He had become disillusioned by the commercialization of Christmas &#x96; and that was during the war years. Imagine how he would see the major holiday observation in the world today. Davies won one of the three Oscars the film garnered. His was for best original story; and his close friend, George Seaton, won the Oscar for the screenplay. The most recognized Oscar was that awarded to Edmund Gwenn for best supporting actor, as Kris Kringle. One scene in the movie puts the author's point clearly. Kris is talking with Alfred (played by Alvin Greenman), a young Macy janitor who plays Santa Claus at an orphanage. They have talked about the changes in attitudes and loss of the Christmas spirit. Kris, That's what I've been fighting against for years &#x85;the way they commercialize Christmas. Alfred, Yeah, there's a lot of bad 'isms' floating around, but one of the worst is 'commercialism.' Make a buck. Mack a buck. Even in Brooklyn it's the same. Don't care what Christmas stands for. Just make a buck. Make a buck. What would Alfred say today with one more 'ism' added &#x96; secularism?This film surely is a holiday classic and favorite. Besides Gwenn, it has a sparkling cast. Maureen O'Hara plays an unusual role for that time &#x96; a divorced single mother who was working in an executive position. Doris Walker was raising her little girl in their mid-town Manhattan apartment. This was 8-year-old Natalie Wood's fifth film and first major role, as Susan Walker. John Payne plays a young attorney, Fred Gailey. Porter Hall is fantastic as Granville Sawyer. He's the twitching neurotic Macy company personnel psychologist (who doesn't have a license to practice, by the way). Much of the comedy occurs in the courtroom sequences. Some of the funniest occurs between Gene Lockhart who plays Judge Henry Harper and William Frawley who plays Charlie Halloran, his campaign manager. All of the cast are excellent. Over the years as I watched this movie with family members, I would see the miracle in the story. Only, it changed from year to year. Or rather, it multiplied. So, in answer to a question that someone might ask, What is the miracle?, it seems clear that there are several. Indeed, this is a film about many miracles, large and small. I'll let the viewers ferret out those themselves. In the meantime, here are some bits of trivia related to the movie. The parade that takes place in the film is the annual Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. Macy's started the annual event in 1924. But, that was four years after Herald Square rival department store, Gimbols had held the first such parade in Philadelphia. At the time, Gimbols was the largest department store chain in the world. If you haven't guessed by now, one of the miracles was the coming together of the heads of those two companies in the spirit of Christmas to direct shoppers to others stores if they couldn't find what they wanted in their store. Here are a couple of favorite lines from the film. Doris, He's crazy. He thinks he is Santa Clause. Julian Shellhammer, I don't care if he thinks he's the Easter Bunny. You've got to get him back. Doris, He's insane, I tell you. Shellhammer, But, but maybe he's only a little crazy &#x85; like painters or composers or some of those men in Washington.Fred and Doris are talking about his defense of Kris in the court hearing. Fred, You don't have any fat in me, do you? Doris, It's not a question of faith. It's just common sense. Fred, Faith is believing in things when common sense tells you not to.

He had become disillusioned by the commercialization of Christmas &#x96; and that was during the war years. Imagine how he would see the major holiday observation in the world today. Davies won one of the three Oscars the film garnered. His was for best original story; and his close friend, George Seaton, won the Oscar for the screenplay. The most recognized Oscar was that awarded to Edmund Gwenn for best supporting actor, as Kris Kringle. One scene in the movie puts the author's point clearly. Kris is talking with Alfred (played by Alvin Greenman), a young Macy janitor who plays Santa Claus at an orphanage. They have talked about the changes in attitudes and loss of the Christmas spirit. Kris, That's what I've been fighting against for years &#x85;the way they commercialize Christmas. Alfred, Yeah, there's a lot of bad 'isms' floating around, but one of the worst is 'commercialism.' Make a buck. Mack a buck. Even in Brooklyn it's the same. Don't care what Christmas stands for. Just make a buck. Make a buck. What would Alfred say today with one more 'ism' added &#x96; secularism?This film surely is a holiday classic and favorite. Besides Gwenn, it has a sparkling cast. Maureen O'Hara plays an unusual role for that time &#x96; a divorced single mother who was working in an executive position. Doris Walker was raising her little girl in their mid-town Manhattan apartment. This was 8-year-old Natalie Wood's fifth film and first major role, as Susan Walker. John Payne plays a young attorney, Fred Gailey. Porter Hall is fantastic as Granville Sawyer. He's the twitching neurotic Macy company personnel psychologist (who doesn't have a license to practice, by the way). Much of the comedy occurs in the courtroom sequences. Some of the funniest occurs between Gene Lockhart who plays Judge Henry Harper and William Frawley who plays Charlie Halloran, his campaign manager. All of the cast are excellent. Over the years as I watched this movie with family members, I would see the miracle in the story. Only, it changed from year to year. Or rather, it multiplied. So, in answer to a question that someone might ask, What is the miracle?, it seems clear that there are several. Indeed, this is a film about many miracles, large and small. I'll let the viewers ferret out those themselves. In the meantime, here are some bits of trivia related to the movie. The parade that takes place in the film is the annual Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. Macy's started the annual event in 1924. But, that was four years after Herald Square rival department store, Gimbols had held the first such parade in Philadelphia. At the time, Gimbols was the largest department store chain in the world. If you haven't guessed by now, one of the miracles was the coming together of the heads of those two companies in the spirit of Christmas to direct shoppers to others stores if they couldn't find what they wanted in their store. Here are a couple of favorite lines from the film. Doris, He's crazy. He thinks he is Santa Clause. Julian Shellhammer, I don't care if he thinks he's the Easter Bunny. You've got to get him back. Doris, He's insane, I tell you. Shellhammer, But, but maybe he's only a little crazy &#x85; like painters or composers or some of those men in Washington.Fred and Doris are talking about his defense of Kris in the court hearing. Fred, You don't have any fat in me, do you? Doris, It's not a question of faith. It's just common sense. Fred, Faith is believing in things when common sense tells you not to.

It would open in Western Europe in early December, in time for Christmas. The world was in no mood for a court in the United States to declare that there is no Santa Claus. Besides the loss of loved ones in the war, the U.S. and other countries had endured years of rationing, sacrifice and going without. The post-war economies were gearing up, people had jobs and money to spend, and families that had gone without now could buy holiday meals and gifts for everyone. The screenplay of Miracle on 34th Street doesn't say anything about all of this. But, it is implied and it was surely understood by the movie audiences that watched the film on its release in 1947.
