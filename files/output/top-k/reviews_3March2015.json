An injured, unconscious , bullet-riddled man (Matt Damon , though Brad Pitt was offered the role but turned it down to do Spy game and Matthew McConaughey , Russell Crowe , Sylvester Stallone were considered) suffering from amnesia before racing to elude assassins and regain his memory . As he recovers, it becomes quite clear, someone is trying to kill him . Now Bourne, and his new friend , Marie Helena Kreutz (Franka Potente , director offered the female lead to Sarah Polley but she declined the part) travel from country to country in search of his new identity. He confronts his enemies in order to find out his situation and is forced to take up violent means to survive . There takes place a twisted plot that seems to be involved the C.I.A cell Treadstone (it is inspired by the real life secret C.I.A cell 'The Enterprise', which organised the Iran-Contra affair) and led by secret agents Ward Abbott (Brian Cox , his character is based on Oliver North) and Alexander Conklin (Chris Cooper , his role is based on Robert McFarlane) . This nail-biting flick contains suspense , thrills , frenetic action, shootouts and violent fights in which our hero is pursued around the world in a relentless chase . From start to finish the noisy action and fast movement is unstopped . This is an expansion of the universe from Robert Ludlum's novels, centered on a new hero whose stakes have been triggered by the exciting events . The Ludlum's novel have also spawned a television series and several more books . However , screenwriter Tony Gilroy , at Doug Liman's instruction, did not read the Bourne Identity novel ; instead, he worked solely from an outline prepared by Liman . In fact , the film has almost nothing to do with the original novel . This is the only film in the Bourne series with any resemblance to the plot of the book it's purportedly based on, and it's a very loose adaptation , all other movies in the series are original screenplays that use only the titles of novels by Robert Ludlum . In the book The Bourne Identity , the main bad guy is a real life criminal genius, Ilich Ramirez Sanchez of Venezuela, better known as Carlos the Jackal . Matt Damon's acting as a hard-rock , two-fisted without identity agent is top-notch . Franka Potente is nice as a young who helps Jason . Both of whom carry out dangerous action scenes . Very good support cast plenty of familiar faces such as Chris Cooper , Clive Owen , Brian Cox , Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje , Gabriel Mann , Walton Goggins , Josh Hamilton , Tim Dutton , Julia Stiles , among others . Colorful and adequate cinematography by Oliver Wood . Rousing musical score fitting to action by John Powell . The motion picture lavishly produced by Frank Marshall was professionally realized by Doug Liman . Other films of this exciting saga are the followings  The first was a 1988 television mini-series titled ¨The Bourne identity¨ by Roger Young in which Jason washes ashore in a small French town , starred by Richard Chamberlain and Jaclyn Smith co-stars . This ¨The Bourne Identity¨ (2002) , followed by ¨Bourne supremacy¨ (2004) by Paul Greengrass ; ¨Bourne ultimatum¨ by Paul Greengrass with screenplay by Tony Gilroy . And thrilling fourth part completing the trilogy ¨The Bourne Legacy¨ (2012) by Tony Gilroy with Jeremy Renner , Edward Norton , Rachel Weisz .

It was long ago that I read anything of Balzac, and that was in school. I understand that this film is a considerable deviation from the novel, and that the theme is altered as well. So, my comments here will be about this movie and story as they are. I won't compare it to the novel or any other productions based on it. But, as its own story, this film, Cousin Bette might very well be compared to other stories of literature and film. About half way through watching the movie, Bette (played by Jessica Lange) reminded me of another character from literature &#x96; Svengali. He was in George du Maurier's 1896 novel, Trilby, that was also set in mid-19th century Paris. Svengali hypnotized the talented Trilby to make her a famous singer. He dominated and controlled her every move. In this film, Cousin Bette doesn't hypnotize but she cleverly manipulates and controls people under the guise of friendship, family and helping them. It isn't just one person, but all of the main characters eventually. And, it isn't to have any of them achieve anything. Rather, she uses them as pawns to help destroy someone else &#x96; most of them, unwittingly. From that standpoint, Jessica Lange's performance is very good. She plays a female Svengali who is even more dastardly than the original character because she brings the death and ruin of more than one person. This Bette could write the book on revenge, conniving, lying, stealing, lusting, manipulating, concealing, deceiving and hating. How anyone can see this film as comedy is beyond me. It is drama and tragedy. It's a tragedy not only for all those whom Bette brought down &#x96; but not because she brought them down. They fell because of their own foibles, deceit, wasteful lifestyles, self-indulgence and meaningless lives and living. That, I think, was the real point of Balzac's novel and others like it. But, it also was a tragedy because Bette lost her own soul in the process. No, I didn't find any glee or chuckles in a black comedy here. This film clearly was tragedy, no matter how the movie marketers labeled it. I suppose all the roles played were good for what the film became. But, I don't get enjoyment out of watching such sinister stories or features of such characters. One can get an idea that the movie will be stuck in the muck of hatred, revenge and destruction and never rise above it or attain any kind of redemption. About mid-point in the film, Bette says, Oh, my dear. The devil has a sister. She was right. And her name is Bette.

Despite warnings from her father (Thomas Mitchell) and her faithful servant Mammy (Hattie McDaniel), Scarlett intends to throw herself at Ashley at an upcoming barbecue at Twelve Oaks.Just like I said in my Chinatown review about checking out beloved classic like well Chinatown and some other movies as well. I have decided to take a break from the new movies that I couldn't give a crap about and I have no interest in them but as a reviewer myself that I force myself to do because that's how much I care about you all, your the reader reading this, before I got zone likes, but now I got you all and I'm very to be alive to review probably the best I've seen since...well since I'm been doing this.This is my first time ever that I've seen Vivien Leigh in and I know it's not the last, because she give such a Oscar worthy performance and- oh wait she already won a Oscar for this movie and for once the Oscars got it right. Vivien Leigh give such a excellent performance and she played the spoiled brat that at the first I hated and then later on her character completely changed and for incredible reason that are both hash but just how life works, and she nailed that perfectly.Now what the Oscars didn't get right is not letting Clark Gable take home gold for his outstanding performance in this movie. Hands down the best character in this whole movie was Rhett Butler, he had the best lines, every time he was on screen I was glued to it and he has a sick sense of humor that most people have, even me.The cinematography in this movie....wow just wow, that's what I call a beautiful sunset in every scene to end the day. There never was a scene in this movie that I thought it didn't look impressive, even with the scenes of civil war at least it looked good and I know that's not a nice thing to say but hey when a movie looks good it's best to be brought up.The director of the movie Victor Fleming who did The Wizard of Oz in the same year as this, and he directed the movie with skill and passion and it really dose show.Now for problems ................I don't have any.Overall Gone With the Wind is a three hour perfection of art that isn't you bloated stick in the mood Hollywood film, not with this movie, at least I can look at this and actually call it an Oscar wining cult classic.

I am non of these and I found this to be a great flick. It just happens to have male strippers from England. The movie is about the struggle to make ends meet, loyalty, and self esteem. These are serious issues, but only Brits could give each a silver lining. Well not just Brits, they just do it the best.As a comedy, I did not find the movie to be very funny. Some bits were humorous, but not much. It was mostly smart, rather than funny. It is rare for me to like a comedy that I did not find funny as this one did. Mostly just Brits get this kind of humour as it is plagued with British slang. I don't care that it wasn't very funny, it was still amusing, enjoyable and clever. Judging from the reviews, I might be the only one that thinks so.The Full Monty is about a group of men who worked at a steel plant that went down under and are now unemployed. Gary Gaz (Carlyle) loves his son and must find employment for unpaid child support payments in order to gain any sort of custody and wants to be with him no matter what. But his son is reluctant to bear witness to his father's misadventures. This subplot is perhaps the best one. His best friend, Dave (Addy) thinks that his wife has fallen out of love with him and must deal with being overweight. They stumble upon a strip club and see hundreds of women paying to see Chippendales. They get the idea to to become strippers themselves and go full monty (completely nude) to offer something new. They find the most unlikely guys to help Their former foreman and choreographer, Gerald (Wilkinson), has lied to his wife about having a job and is worried about his impotence; Lomper is an ugly redhead who once contemplated suicide; Horse is a former disco dancer who still has the moves but not the looks; and Guy can help out most with the looks. That is what I love about this, the lead characters (Gaz, Dave, Gerald) are deeply written and the rest are deep enough and memorable. Despite being an English movie, there is no real offensive nudity. Just a few scenes with shirtless guys and butts briefly shown. That was the one element I was unsure about before watching this. I'm sure the Unrated version is worse. As a movie, I liked how everything was built up. But what makes this such a wonderful film is the themes of unemployment, loyalty and self-esteem. A bunch of guys with no jobs have to resort to do something anybody can do just to make a buck. In the beginning, we see Gaz and Dave stealing metal from the plant and trying to sell them. That is how desperate they are. The guys are too scrawny and too ugly to be strippers, but they do not care. Gaz needs the money fast or else he will lose the most important thing in his life. The others need money in order to keep their pride alive and keep their families together. That is were the self-esteem factor ties in. They know they're ugly and not lean, so they have second thoughts about following through. Dave is overweight, so he has the biggest problem image-wise. They have hit the rock bottom, so they feel completely worthless. At first none of them are up to it, but they have nothing to lose so they take risks and build up their confidence. Admirability towards these men grows. They are loyal and band together, but must stay together when the going gets tough. Each have their own reasons for joining, but all have the same reasons for thinking about quitting. Each man is a piece of the puzzle that is needed for a successful show and a rebuild in their lives.Not just one of my favourite British comedies, one of my favourites in general.

Mostly because Rain Man is about the human mind and what it needs and what it wants; subject that's usually tackled through books rather than film. However, the movie answers these questions perfectly. And it's hard to write about anything that's truly perfect. But, here's what Rain Man as a movie is about. The film follows a workaholic brother by the name of Charlie Bay and his interactions with his savant brother Raymond. Telling you why Charlie has to interact with his brother is said in the synopsis above. But telling you in detail nears spoiler territory and that brings me to the first reason why this film is brilliant.The film highlights the details of everybody in the film. The film thrives of the small parts or scenes that would otherwise be secondary in other films. In other words, the film is built around how much you do and don't know about a character. That includes personality, how they talk, where they live, everything. It's both a blind viewer's utopia and dystopia rolled into one because if one thing is spoiled, there's always something right behind it to make up for it.Second, the film knows how much needs to be said in a shot or scene. It's like the Citizen Kane of weird, realistic, drama. It knows how much you need to know about a character. It knows how much landscape it should show you. It knows how much weird is enough. It knows what kind of lives these people live and how much you want to know about their lives. The pacing alone can fill three essays.Third, it's about characters. Not how the actors portray the characters, but about characters. Every actor and I mean EVERY actor, from Hoffman to the waitress in that one scene, they all become these characters. And that's what an actor should do in a movie. The actor should improve an already fantastic script. The actors play the characters so well that you can no longer see where the direction, acting, or writing ends or begins; it all just becomes one.Rain Man is beautifully simplistic and yet one of the most thought provoking movies I've ever seen.

If you were a teen in suburban America in the 1980's (as I was), this was your film, or at least it was supposed to be. The Boomers had The Graduate and Easy Rider, the Silent Generation had Rebel Without a Cause and American Graffiti. We have The Breakfast Club. Or do we? Is it a cinematic masterpiece or overrated? Let's take a second look at this cult classic because as of this writing, the 30th anniversary of its release is coming up in 2015 with theatrical viewings scheduled around the country. Generation X'ers will be lining up to relive their teenage years. While in his 30's, John Hughes had a brief directing career making films targeted to Generation X'ers. Hughes offerings were considered the fresh new voice speaking both to and from the point of view of Generation X, offspring of the sons and daughters of those who were children during and just after World War II, a.k.a the Silent and Baby Boom Generations. Hughes also directed Ferris Bueller's Day Off, Sixteen Candles, and Pretty in Pink. Many of Hughes' films used the same talent. These youthful upstarts of our generation were fondly known as The Brat Pack. (Some of the brat actors transitioned into adult careers while others fell off the radar.) Among Hughes' favorite talent were Molly Ringwold, Anthony Michael Hall, and Ally Sheedy, all present and accounted for in Breakfast Club. By 1991, the Generation X'ers were becoming young adults, graduating from college and beginning careers and families. The voice of 80's teen angst was becoming passé. Hughes directed his last film in 1991, Curly Sue, which paired a Boomer and a Millennial with disastrous results. It ultimately bombed at the box office. So does Breakfast Club uphold today? Well sort of yes sort of no. There is no plot per se, only a setting. The setting is the high school library where five teenagers are being held in a day-long detention on a Saturday for wrong-doings which are never made completely clear. The real story is about each character and how they get to know one another. The film's strength is also its weakness, depending upon your point of view. Each student comes from a different aspect of the student body of the fictional high school. They are in essence, prototypes, maybe even stereotypes, of each of the different faces of the school. Molly Ringwold is from the popular and chic crowd of girls who wear makeup and nice clothes. Judd Nelson is the rule-breaker, who we imagine never does his homework and goofs off at the back of the classes he takes if he's not cutting school altogether. Even from the get-go, we predict that this is not Nelson's first time in detention. Emilio Estevez is the jock, probably a football player and wrestler. Ally Sheedy is the loser loner female, who at first grosses out Ringwold. Anthony Michael Hall plays the brain, a kid who gets straight A's, especially in science classes, but who is otherwise not part of the popular crowd.The idea is that these kids would never have even said hello to one another during a typical school day because they are all worlds apart. However, because they're in detention for various infractions, they are forced to meet and interact with one another. The main crux of the story is how the kids learn about each other and how they both fit and don't fit into their own stereotypes. They also begin engaging in behavior of their opposite counterparts, such as when Estevez smokes and does cart wheels on the upper floor of the library, similar to what Nelson's character usually does. This aspect of the film succeeds in spades. As a character study, it works very well. It could almost be a play.Where the story lags slightly is in its lack of a storyline. When I first saw it, I had high-expectations because it was already becoming the must-see film for my generation. After viewing, I found I generally enjoyed it, but seeing kids simply talking and having some fun for 90 minutes is not exactly why I want to see a film. Near the end, is the famous dance scene where the characters let loose and let it all hang out. Hall being the brain is the DJ. Dance scenes like this were very popular with Generation X films of this sort, but now they seem rather dated. I want to see characters deal with and overcome dilemmas, not just talk about themselves and dance around. Of course the subtlety is to see the characters change slightly by interacting with kids they never otherwise would have. While I believe it's a nice beginning of an idea, I don't think it's enough to carry through an entire film.The Breakfast Club may be more important in terms of what it represents, the angst of Generation X, rather than it being a masterpiece of filmmaking and storytelling in its own right. The mark of a great film is when it speaks to later generations. I have seen The Graduate, American Graffiti, and Rebel Without a Cause many times, and they never seem dated, even though these were targeted to previous generations. Does The Breakfast Club do this for me? Not quite. It may have spoken more to me during that time, but it says less to me now. Maybe I wanted the cast to rip away the ridiculous sculpture in the middle of the library in the way that Dustin Hoffman steals away the bride at the end of the Graduate. Or for the kids to engage in something together, like the race at the end of American Graffiti. For all its honesty, even by the end of their detention, the Breakfast Clubbers were still in their own prison, the 1980's.

Anthony Michael Hall plays the brain, a kid who gets straight A's, especially in science classes, but who is otherwise not part of the popular crowd.The idea is that these kids would never have even said hello to one another during a typical school day because they are all worlds apart. However, because they're in detention for various infractions, they are forced to meet and interact with one another. The main crux of the story is how the kids learn about each other and how they both fit and don't fit into their own stereotypes. They also begin engaging in behavior of their opposite counterparts, such as when Estevez smokes and does cart wheels on the upper floor of the library, similar to what Nelson's character usually does. This aspect of the film succeeds in spades. As a character study, it works very well. It could almost be a play.Where the story lags slightly is in its lack of a storyline. When I first saw it, I had high-expectations because it was already becoming the must-see film for my generation. After viewing, I found I generally enjoyed it, but seeing kids simply talking and having some fun for 90 minutes is not exactly why I want to see a film. Near the end, is the famous dance scene where the characters let loose and let it all hang out. Hall being the brain is the DJ. Dance scenes like this were very popular with Generation X films of this sort, but now they seem rather dated. I want to see characters deal with and overcome dilemmas, not just talk about themselves and dance around. Of course the subtlety is to see the characters change slightly by interacting with kids they never otherwise would have. While I believe it's a nice beginning of an idea, I don't think it's enough to carry through an entire film.The Breakfast Club may be more important in terms of what it represents, the angst of Generation X, rather than it being a masterpiece of filmmaking and storytelling in its own right. The mark of a great film is when it speaks to later generations. I have seen The Graduate, American Graffiti, and Rebel Without a Cause many times, and they never seem dated, even though these were targeted to previous generations. Does The Breakfast Club do this for me? Not quite. It may have spoken more to me during that time, but it says less to me now. Maybe I wanted the cast to rip away the ridiculous sculpture in the middle of the library in the way that Dustin Hoffman steals away the bride at the end of the Graduate. Or for the kids to engage in something together, like the race at the end of American Graffiti. For all its honesty, even by the end of their detention, the Breakfast Clubbers were still in their own prison, the 1980's.

It's Based on a Novella by Stephen King The film is based on Stephen King's novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption, which was published in a short story collection called Different Seasons. Two of the other short stories in the collection were made into films, Stand By Me in 1986 and Apt Pupil in 1998. Only one of them, The Breathing Method, has not been turned into a movie.2. It's Similar to Tolstoy King's novella shares several plot points with a nine-page short story by Russian writer Leo Tolstoy called God Sees the Truth, But Waits. Both are about men sent to prison for murders they didn't commit.3. Director Frank Darabont Got a Good Deal on the Rights to King's Story He bought the rights from King for $1.4. It Almost Had a Much Different Cast Castle Rock Entertainment, the studio that made Shawshank, was co-founded by Rob Reiner&#x97;director of another King adaptation, Stand By Me&#x97;and is named after the mythical Maine town that provides the setting for many of King's books. After director Frank Darabont pitched Shawshank to the studio, Reiner originally offered $2.5 million for the script to star Tom Cruise as Andy Dufresne and Harrison Ford as Red.5. The Original Title Was Changed to Avoid Confusion Darabont wrote the script in eight weeks before pitching it to Castle Rock Entertainment. He decided to drop the Rita Hayworth part of the novella because actresses sent their resumes in for consideration thinking it was a Rita Hayworth biopic. During the casting process, Darabont even received a call from an agent who represented a supermodel; he swore the script was the best she had ever read and that she'd be perfect for the (non-existent) part of Hayworth.6. It Was Filmed in Ohio Although the film is set in Maine, the Ohio State Reformatory in Mansfield, Ohio stood in for Shawshank Prison. The structure was slated to be torn down, but the production delayed the demolition for a year. After the film wrapped, all the buildings in the complex were torn down except the cell block and main administrative building, which were preserved for historical purposes.7. Morgan Freeman Got Really Good at Catch The scene where Andy first approaches Red about the rock hammer as Red plays catch in the main yard took nine hours to shoot. Freeman continued to play catch for the whole nine hours without complaining and showed up the next day with his arm in a sling.8. The Film Was Inspired by Goodfellas Darabont says his main source of inspiration was Martin Scorsese's Goodfellas because of its use of voice-over narration and editing techniques.9. Voiceovers Are Tricky Business Originally, all of Morgan Freeman's voice-over was recorded before any of the film was shot. The fact that much of it syncs up to the on screen action (see the scene on the roof where the inmates drink beer) isn't simple editing. Darabont would playback the recorded voice-over on-set during each take for the actors to specifically play off of the audio. But the audio quality of his voice-over was too poor to include in the movie due to tape hiss, so Freeman had to re-record the entire voice-over in post-production.10. They Got Lucky with One of the Most Famous Scenes Every take of the film's signature shot of Tim Robbins raising his arms outstretched in the rain after Andy breaks out of prison was out of focus except the one in the film.

The story isn't as interesting, crazy or scary as many in the series, the pace of the story is much slower (whole film should have been at least 15 minutes shorter), and the banter between the main characters is not as sharp.And since ALL of this is also true of the later I Want to Believe feature film--except even more so-- then the only conclusion I can come to is that Chris Carter should stick to TV. At least as far as X-Files goes. A genius at TV, he just doesn't seem to get what works in movies.I hope they revive the series with Gillian Anderson and David Duchovny in the leads. It would actually make more sense for experienced FBI agents to be in their mid 40s to early 50s, in my opinion. (of course, it helps that Duchovny is still quire handsome and Anderson has gotten even hotter in her mid years).

As outrageous and off-the-wall as this film appears, it is still a guilty pleasure of mine with great re-watch appeal.I guess this film could be classified as a biopic, but it's hard for me to come at it from that direction, partially because the film is not really about Joan Crawford, it is a look at Crawford through the eye of her adopted daughter, a somewhat jaundiced and bigoted eye, if the truth be told. It's hard to know exactly if what is presented in this film is fact or fiction, because there are large portions of the book that aren't even addressed in this film. In real life, Crawford adopted two other children who don't even exist in the film, so it's hard to take this film seriously as a biography of the great actress, but more as a one-sided, larger-than-life view of the actress through the eyes of her daughter, who definitely had serious issues with the woman, primarily the fact that, in Christina's eyes, Crawford seemed to care more about her career than her children. It is implied early in the film that Crawford's adoption of Christina was more of a publicity stunt to aid a flailing career than out of a genuine desire to be a mother, but I don't think anyone has a way of knowing if that's really true and I was bothered by the implication, but I digress.The film is completely watchable thanks to an electrifying performance by Faye Dunaway as Joan Crawford. Dunaway is mesmerizing and clearly did her homework, obviously watching a lot of Crawford's work before she began filming...there is a scene where Crawford has just been let go from MGM and she gets up and walks slowly out of Louis B Mayer's office and I swear I got chills...the walk was amazing, just one of the many layers that Dunaway brought to the physicality of the character. There are some over-the-top moments, like the infamous wire hanger scene, the cleaning the bathroom scene and the chopping of the rose bushes where Dunaway makes Crawford appear slightly insane, but I don't blame Dunaway for that completely, partial blame has to go to director Frank Perry for not properly reigning in his actress.Two actresses were utilized to play Christina Crawford as a child and as teen\/adult Christina. If the truth be told, I much preferred young Mara Hobel's work as young Christina, as opposed to Diana Scarwid, who comes off rather wooden as the adult Christina. Mention should also be made of Rutanya Alda as Crawford's devoted housekeeper Carol Ann and Howard da Silva as Louis B Mayer. Steve Forrest was just miscast as Gregory Savitt, Crawford's on-again off again lover who, according to the film, brokered Christina's adoption through some slightly shady means, a character I'm pretty much convinced was fictional, but despite everything, the film is worth checking out for Faye Dunaway's endlessly fascinating performance as Joan Crawford.

Kurosawa did nothing without thought, and this film was very much more thoughtful than the first ( yojimbo).To put it simply the first film was almost all comedy and farce, whereas the second film this review is primarily concerned with is much more a tale of the times it takes place in; a political intrigue period piece, filled with action, better set design, props, extras galore, moxy if you will. The directors penchant for tongue and cheek is no more than the veritable spice of life as I call it, that all humans whom have lived experience in this life. But even with a tad comedic realism, this film has much more character, captivates and requires more attention and intellect to follow and is just an all around superior film. I highly recommend this to anyone seeking older films that do not reek of unnecessary melodic overtones or dance routines. The best black and white films didn't need such things. Now go enjoy a fine film!

But during this time much turmoil and corruption ran rampant through the country as outside influences with vested interests propelled the land into  do or die mode; change or BE changed. Thus the political climate is one of unseemly individuals whom stop at nothing to cement themselves into positions of power and all in the way be damned to JIGOKU ( hell). But in the heat and lust for power a kindly, old fashioned politician is abducted by more devious sorts commonly associated with their station ( not too different form nowadays).
