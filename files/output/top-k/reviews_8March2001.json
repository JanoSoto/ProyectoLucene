This is truly film magic.  Mel Gibson plays the best role he has ever played.  He also directed and produced this epic.  YES, the movie is not very historically accurate.  But, aren't most movies of this type inaccurate?  Plus, we know so little about William Wallace that it is hard to be accurate.  At least the American public knows about him.Now a comment about the other actors.  I REALLY liked the two female roles.  I thought Catherine McCormack as Murron was ideal.  She had a very Celtic feel about her, and she is VERY good looking too.  I also liked Sophie Marceau as Princess Isabella.  Sophie is GORGEOUS.  My favorite male actors (besides Mel) HAD to be David O'Hara as Stephen and Brendan Gleeson as Hamish.  But, overall, everybody did a great job.

It is also not only a social prophecy but a study of Free will and mans capacity to choose morally regarding issues that affects his\/her life and those around them.It is also a scathing study of Politics\/and the dazzling effects of language and music.in 1971,9 years after the novel first appeared.Kubrick's film smashed onto the screen in nightmarish abundance.Considering the wake of candid pornography that was now exploited artistically in theatre as opposed to the first few years after the novels presentation,The films contents were there to shock morally and not to merely titillate.Unfortunately a few months after the films initial release,it was withdrawn from Kubrick himself from release in the UK and other countries due to the fact that copycat gangs from the one's depicted in the film were beginning to arise and causing mayhem in the streets of the UK,The film was vowed never to be realeased ever again by Kubrick,until after his death.Considering the film may have been deemed somewhat 'dated' in my generation (me being 23 oh my brothers)To this day the only irellevance the book and film has to modern society is the description of the clothes Alex and his droogs wear for fillying and shopcrasting,and his 'Horrowshow' kickboots for kicking 'Litsos' in.Malcolm Mcdowell turns out an ingenious performance as the young hooligan Alex who loves to have a good time,but at the tragic expense of others.We follow the story from his point of view as he governs his droogs (Nadsat for Friends)into all mannerism of tyranny and wrong doing all through to submissive therapy at the hands of a power hungry Political force and his remission back into the society he had once done wrong by as a man who is incapable of making a moral choice.A man who has had his free will stripped from him and all the burdens he created coming back to haunt him.What can be gained from his remission is the questionIf man is defined by his capacity to choose between courses of moral action,between good and evil,should he be conditioned only to perform what is believed socially acceptable by others??The use of language in this film is known as 'Nadsat'(A subliminal soviet-russian teenage slang.)and takes little effort to interpret what the characters are saying,but adds to the brilliance and originality of the story telling.What is the most disturbing aspect is that Alex comes across as such a charasmatic and intelligent citizen,that you wonder shamelessly why he commits the atrocities that he does..A most amazing film on all counts,Disturbing,profound,surreal,controversial,entertaining and overall,mindblowing...Dont miss it...
