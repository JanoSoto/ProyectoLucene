This movie has every single memorable line you could possibly imagine. From Yeah, baby! to Riiiiiight, Mike Myers is a genius when it comes to comedy! I think everyone could say that they laughed at least once to this film.Paroding of the James Bond flicks, Austin Powers is an international spy who is a lady's man. Dr. Evil, is Arch Nemesis, goes into the future of 1997 and now Austin must travel through time to find him. When he gets to 1997, he has a beautiful assistant, Vanessa, who happens to be the daughter of his former flame in the 60's. Vanessa resists Austin's charm and wants to stick to business while Austin is wasting no time to get to his business with her. Dr. Evil learns that he has a son, Scott played by Seth Green. When Scott isn't as excited to have Dr. Evil as a father, Dr. Evil tries anything he can to get Scott to love him, including a hilarious scene in a counseling group for father's and son's. But back into action, Austin must find Dr. Evil before he rules the world with his kitty, Mr. Bigglesworth. But can he do that and have Vanessa at the same time? You'll just have to see! My favorite characters that worked so well together was without a doubt Seth and Mike as Dr. Evil and Scott. They are just beyond hilarious and work so well together. I think a lot of the other Austin Powers fans would agree. There first scene together meeting is just really funny, Give Daddy a hug! I'm down with the kids, ducka ducka ducka! No! Get away from me you psycho!. Classic! Like I said Austin Powers is just a great and funny movie that I think you can get into if you're looking for a decent comedy. Come on!

Okay, okay, so I'm being a little unfair. First off, I gotta say do NOT look at the cast list. A lot of the really good jokes in the movie come from unexpected cameos, and knowing about them beforehand will destroy a lot of the humor. The opening has a whole bevy of these surprises, and is easily one of the cleverest scenes in the film. Unfortunately, the freshness and originality wears off quickly. As each of the characters are reintroduced, it just gets more and more uncomfortable. It becomes increasingly clear that no one involved really cares. Mike Myers seems to be strolling on screen, re-enacting each of his catchphrases, and collecting his check.

I was quite surprised when watching, as there is little blood and no guts what-so-ever, so to class it as a zombie movie doesnt seem right, more of a horror-thriller, which in fact it claims to be. Various aspects of the CGI were inpressive, although I did find the licker seemed to be missing something. Good performances by all the cast, although after watching this you may begin to hate Michelle Rodrigez as, yet again, she plays the same hard-core bitch with an attitude, at points coming out with some very bad lines. Personally, I'm finding her a bit tiresome. Overall a good movie and worth buying, I tend to also get the sequel on import too, so we'll see how they have handled that. 8\/10 ","genre":"Action, Horror, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"28 July 2002","score":"","review":"  I went into this movie expecting to find it lacking in some way. From what I had heard through the grap vine, which is the critics bylines, the funniest parts of the movie happened in the first few moments of the film and after that it became, to quote Austin himself, ouch baby, very ouch. I heard that Austin was in it too much, that the new character of Goldmember was curiously unfunny, and that the movie was comprised of mostly re-hashed old jokes. But now, having seen the movie, I realize what the critics, in their own eloquent manner, were trying to tell all of us would- be Austin viewers; that they are MORONS!!!! First, anyone remember a critic who LOVED the first or second Powers movies? Anyone? Please, I can't hear you so you might have to stand up. No one? Well, can't say that I do either, so does it come as any truly cosmic suprise that the critics again are decidedly cool to down right deep frozen towards the newest installment? It reminds me of earlier this year when critic after critic talked of the ol Star Wars movies as prized American treasures and spoke of how the new movies were but dim shadows of the old brilliance of the early films. Yet, go back and read the reviews of the old Star Wars movies. Glowing would not be the first word to stream across your mind. The same thing with Austin. The majority of critics complaining that Powers has lost his mojo are the same fellas and fellets that couldn't see the mojo in the first place. So what I need to do now, for all of you fellow Austin lovers who have been scared to heavens by the reviews is, as Dr. Evil says, to throw you a freakin bone here. Goldmember is great, and not just the character. The cameos are funny, but the brilliance of the film comes from the addition of the new character, Goldmember, and the expansion of mini-me role in the film. It is quite clear to me, having listened to the audience reaction, that these movies have become much more about Dr. Evil and mini-me then anyone else, but the interaction that the characters have with one another are fantastic. Are old jokes re-hashed here, absolutely, that has been one of the charms of the other two. But there are plenty of new and innovative gags that had the audience I watched it with on the floor. The musical interludes are riotous, and there are certain scenes that will have you almost falling out of your chair. Is this one as good as the second? In my opinion no, I have never laughed as hard at a movie as I did at the second Austin Powers, but it is, very much up to par with the first and has several scenes that rival the second for those can't stop laughing moments. Micheal Caine is perfect as the suave Nigel Powers, Austins dad, as Caine, while not being given hysterical material to work with, uses what he is given to the best of his talents and ends up giving, in my opinion, some of the more memorable lines in the film. Beyonce Knowles, yet another singer turned actress, does a remarkably good job here, displeeling any rumors that she was giving Heather Graham a run for her money as the worst actress in an Austin to film to date. Knowles is beautiful, strong, sassy, and 1970's ghettos all at the same time and there are no scenes she takes part in where you get that boy, she just seems lost sense. Myers, well, Myers is Myers and if ou have not been convinced that his comedy is genius yet, combining slap-stick with gross out with intelligent humor, then you just are not capable of liking this film. Myers is just Myers, and his new character Goldmember is terrific. Finally, however, is mini-me, whose name escapes me right now. Mini-me has perhaps some of the funniest moments of the entire film, and the concept of having him be a mute has been one of the best comic choices to date. Mini-me is funny because he is small, but also because the little guy is just damn funny. The faces, the sounds, the humping, they are all incorporated into this wonderful little character that is truly allowed to take off in this film. The fight between Austin and mini-me is sure to have you gasping for air. The only problem I had with this film was the end, which I felt was a bit forced and not as creative as the other two endings had been, but with Myers creative genius at work, if there is a fifth, I am sure that the problems created at the end are easily  fixed. This movie is funny, witty, and just plain enjoyable. If you love Austin Powers then run, don't walk, run to see this movie (I wonder if anyone has actually ever run to see a movie after reading something like that?) and if you want to enjoy yourself, check the critics reviews at the door.
