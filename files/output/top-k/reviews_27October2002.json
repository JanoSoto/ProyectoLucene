Like several others who have posted here, I ended up turning on the subtitles. I have had to use subtitles before with a few British films (Those with what I suppose to be 'lower class accents,' namely in Little Voice and The Full Monty.

Even at the end, I was trying to connect the names with the faces and sort out their relationships.  (Having the subtitles on probably made this worse as I was paying more attention to the words rather than what was shown on-screen.)  I disagree with those who have said that the mystery is not solved at the end...the 2 parties are accused and both are guilty!  I think I would have gotten even more out of this film if I would have viewed it again, but I don't have the patience to do that. Afterwards, we watched the Deleted Scenes with Altman's commentary on why they were deleted.  Time after time, Altman said that various scenes were deleted because they were not necessary to the plot, or that the point had been explained elsewhere.  I disagree.  With as many characters as there were, I think that reinforcing a few points would have made the film easier to follow.  Overall 7\/10.  I am thinking about down-grading to a 6\/10.

Tired with Cubby Broccoli's insistence, he asked for a ridiculously high amount of money to do Bond again. Surprisingly, they accepted! So ol' Sean had to do the movie, but he had an ace up his sleeve he intentionally acted the worse he could, to keep himself protected to return to 007 anymore.That's why his performance in Diamonds Are Forever is the single worst one in all his career. He looks intentionally bored, makes faces that read wish I was somewhere else, and underplays James Bond as much, that he over-underacts (if such a thing is possible). Truly, this man is an acting genius, equally effective in giving awesome performances (like in The Man Who Would Be King, The Name of the Rose, or pick any other film with him that's not this one) than in serving loads of acting poo poo.I'm not saying Diamonds Are Forever is bad only because of this boycott. Even with Sean at his finest, this movie would suck. The screenplay is a joke! From the flipping-side car to the Place that tape back, Mr. Bond conclusion, everything's unbelievably ridiculous, and predates the worst Roger Moore-era silliness (and yes, the guys who defined it as A Roger Moore Bond starring Sean Connery got it right).

I have a part-time job in a small store selling movies, and I am an advocate for small titles, the under-dogs of the industry.  They are where you find your best friends, your most enduring memories.  They represent what movie-making can and should be.  I have always believed that when the masses rally in favor of anything, it is time to stay far, far away.   I should have adhered to my belief.Nia Vardalos, the writer and star of this project, seems to harbor a genuine ill will towards every member of her family, and this movie has allowed her to vent her anger and make a buck or two in the process. I'm surprised that no one from the Greek community has stepped forward to voice their outrage at the portrayal of all the Greek characters in this film, including its leading lady, as loud, stupid, self-centered, inconsiderate, manipulative, purveyors of extremely bad taste.These are not well-drawn characters telling a smart little story.  Toula sees Ian, Ian sees Toula, she gives herself a drastic makeover (which no one notices), enrolls in college, (you think because Ian is there, but no), becomes a computer wiz, leaves her father's business (who knew it would be that easy?), takes over her aunt's travel agency where she is instantly gregarious (once again, who knew?), and she gets to sit at the beautiful-girl table at college (all she had to do was ask, or the popular girls only had to age 20 years and get some manners). Toula goes from being one of the most unattractive women I've seen on the screen in a long time, to being one of the most unattractive made-up, made-over women I've seen on the screen in a long time.  Early in the film, Ian says to his friend, Mike, that all the women Mike has been setting him up with `look alike', and it's a good thing Nia gives us this nugget, or we wouldn't know what the basis for their relationship was.  It's Nia doesn't look like anyone else, and that's it, and that's all.  The development of their relationship is Toula talking about her family, Toula making stupid faces at Ian, and Toula and Ian making out in Ian's car and, eventually, his apartment. And who knew becoming Greek Orthodox was as simple as a wading pool; some short, shorts; and a horny, big-haired Greek girl rubbing you down with oil. The bundt-cake bit was embarrassingly bad.  Please!!!  I not only know baklava; I can spell and pronounce it.  If Ian's squeamish, WASPy, priggish parents had also brought donuts, Toula's mother would have had a place to put her herb garden.  And Ian seems like a nice guy, so what's with the empty church on his side and the packed pews on Toula's side?  Things are only funny or sad, Nia (and Rita), if they make sense.  You could watch Monsoon Wedding for a lesson.This movie is about over-the-top, offensive, stereotypes.

","genre":null},{"date":"27 October 2002","score":"7 out of 14 people found the following review useful","review":"  SPOILER WARNING (if that's possible)My Big Fat Greek Wedding is a big, fat American-movie mess.  It is a live-action, bad joke and, like any bad joke, it is mean-spirited and not funny.  It wants you to believe it has a big heart, it doesn't.  I have a part-time job in a small store selling movies, and I am an advocate for small titles, the under-dogs of the industry.  They are where you find your best friends, your most enduring memories.  They represent what movie-making can and should be.  I have always believed that when the masses rally in favor of anything, it is time to stay far, far away.   I should have adhered to my belief.Nia Vardalos, the writer and star of this project, seems to harbor a genuine ill will towards every member of her family, and this movie has allowed her to vent her anger and make a buck or two in the process. I'm surprised that no one from the Greek community has stepped forward to voice their outrage at the portrayal of all the Greek characters in this film, including its leading lady, as loud, stupid, self-centered, inconsiderate, manipulative, purveyors of extremely bad taste.These are not well-drawn characters telling a smart little story.  Toula sees Ian, Ian sees Toula, she gives herself a drastic makeover (which no one notices), enrolls in college, (you think because Ian is there, but no), becomes a computer wiz, leaves her father's business (who knew it would be that easy?), takes over her aunt's travel agency where she is instantly gregarious (once again, who knew?), and she gets to sit at the beautiful-girl table at college (all she had to do was ask, or the popular girls only had to age 20 years and get some manners). Toula goes from being one of the most unattractive women I've seen on the screen in a long time, to being one of the most unattractive made-up, made-over women I've seen on the screen in a long time.  Early in the film, Ian says to his friend, Mike, that all the women Mike has been setting him up with `look alike', and it's a good thing Nia gives us this nugget, or we wouldn't know what the basis for their relationship was.  It's Nia doesn't look like anyone else, and that's it, and that's all.  The development of their relationship is Toula talking about her family, Toula making stupid faces at Ian, and Toula and Ian making out in Ian's car and, eventually, his apartment. And who knew becoming Greek Orthodox was as simple as a wading pool; some short, shorts; and a horny, big-haired Greek girl rubbing you down with oil. The bundt-cake bit was embarrassingly bad.  Please!!!  I not only know baklava; I can spell and pronounce it.  If Ian's squeamish, WASPy, priggish parents had also brought donuts, Toula's mother would have had a place to put her herb garden.  And Ian seems like a nice guy, so what's with the empty church on his side and the packed pews on Toula's side?  Things are only funny or sad, Nia (and Rita), if they make sense.

Extended shots of corpses lying with their innards strewn about, and blood everywhere, vivid, gloppy red, and glistening under gratuitously bright lighting.There is even an over-the-top lesbian scene which could have been snipped directly from the Spice Channel.

In the first Species, we got to watch Natasha Henstridge begin as an ignorant and speechless child, and gradually integrate with humans by learning their language and behaviors through trial and error.  Here, the alien is a split personality jock (who looks like a 1980s Tom Cruise), and dislikable from the very start, not at all rewarding to watch or learn about.  The other characters just seem to be going through the motions, and there is none of the seriousness or realism that we saw before.  To complete the unbelievable cliche, they have even added a wise-cracking black guy to the cast... You know that one?

This movie does have a fairly nice wrapup, as it takes place in a barn and there's some good old fashioned walloping, stabbing and wrestling-- perhaps the only high point of this dumb movie, and the only capacity in which it is superior to the first.Still, it's a drag and a shame. And like I said... literally shocking in its amateur execution.   Watch this one first, and it will make the original Species look like the 'Citizen Kane' of SciFi Horror.Species 2 is really ideal for Mystery Science Theater.Score D-Avoids an F only because of Madsen's presence, and the very end.

The indians and their customs and way of life were not what was outdated.  Both the indian characters and the actors portraying them stay true to life and timeless.  But Costner seems like a fish out of water. He makes the fatal flaw of being overly sentimental, both for himself in front of the camera and behind it.

After having seen the way he portrayed the English-Scottish conflict and the amazing cinematography and script that he incorparated, Dances With Wolves comes across as a B movie.  With Gibson, I see no sympathy for self - he seems to trust in the work and the subject matter to carry his film along vibrantly and with truth.  Costner, in turn, seems to feel the need to constantly show his empathy and courage in order to make sure that you see him in the light which suits him best.  I wish I could vote higher, especially as Graham Greene gave the film such heart and truth, but Costner just blaringly stood in my way.Still, a good film to watch.  Enlightening and a bitter reminder of what America once was and the people that were it's true inhabitants only to be treated in a despicable fashion.  A good history lesson, but the lines are just a little too blurred for my taste.

Freddy has got to be the most horribly written and directed movie I've seen since Battlefield Earth.  To add furthur insult to an already doomed movie is a horrible acting job done by Tom Green, whose soul comedic approach is to make an ass of himself whenever the opportunity arises.  Why must Tom Green always wander into a scene, doing something stupid and making an excuse as to why he is doing it? Then repeat that lame excuse over-and-over again?Tom Green reminds me of that guy in class that did dumb things to get attention, and people laughed, which made him believe he was popular, he continued to do it, not realizing that people were laughing AT him.  But that's just my opinion.OK, the plot goes like this, Gord Brody (Tom Green) in an aspiring cartoonist who gets rejected by a cartoon company for his lame ideas, he returns home, lives with his parents and does a bunch of stuff.  That's it. Everything.  The fact that I summed up the whole plot in less than two sentences speaks for itself.The biggest fault that FGF has is the fact that it tries to shock more than it tries to be funny, many times it had me wondering why 20th Century Fox gave Tom Green a budget to begin with.  Jacking a horse is not funny, swinging a newborn baby by the umbilical cord with blood splattering around is just sick, if you enjoy this, then please go out and rent Dumb & Dumber and watch that, that is shock\/bathroom humour done properly.  Not subtle, but not over-the-top, combine that with some talented comedians and a good premise, then you have a great film.I am being really harsh with this movie, so I will even everything out by listing some things I did like about it.  The shower scene with Green in a scuba suit looking for lost treasure was amusing, as was the animated Zebras in America sketch at the end.  The daddy would you like some sausage? scene could have been decent as well, if not for it being shown 234,213 times in the previews.  Other times, this movie failed to please or amuse.  The acting hurt most of all, Rip Torn is the only one whose performance was just as painful as the star, just seeing him show his bare behind while drunk and saying to Green **** me! will set back his career at least a decade.  I just wanted to reach through the screen and smack Torn upside the head for saying Yes to this project.Horrible, barely funny in any respect, if that was Tom Green's purpose, then he succeeded, but that does not equal a likeable movie.  The fact that there are Hollywood executives marketing THIS crap to my demographic, thinking we like it, is something I take great offense to.  Tom Green did waste 15 million of 20th Century Fox's money and 90 minutes of my time, hopefully we both learned from this disaster.  First Battlefield Earth and now this, the Razzies are going to have a fun time when they hand out Worst Movie of the Decade award in 8 years.0.5\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"27 October 2002","score":"12 out of 16 people found the following review useful","review":"  I watched Freddy Got Fingered knowing full-well of all the horrible reviews and backlash this movie suffered, and it is all deserved.
