The opening of Lethal Weapon 4 is typical Lethal Weapon and done to perfection. Martin Riggs and Roger Murtaugh have been called to a disruption in downtown L.A. Anyway this maniac is destroying things with a fire torch, yet the experienced cop partners are in deep and meaningful discussion about there personal life instead of getting the bad guy. So Riggs tells Murtaugh to take off his clothes down to his boxers and to flap his arms like a chicken. So Murtaugh does it, Riggs 'blows' the bad guy away and once again makes his partner look like an idiot. This start just made me ask for more, and my wish was to be granted.  Martin Riggs and Roger Murtaugh, each now feeling too old to be doing what they're doing, try to stop the Chinese Triads from doing their illegal business in the U.S. Uncle Benny, Chinatown's mob boss, has imported Chinese slaves to pay for an artist to create counterfeit Chinese currency which the Triads will use to buy the Four Fathers (heads of the Triads) back from the Chinese military. Lee Butters joins the team as a new cop and Leo Getz is back, now as a P.I. The cast of Lethal Weapon 4 was fantastic. I want to give praise to the performance of martial arts specialist Jet Li. His scenes in this movie were fantastic and left me dumb-founded at times. He is a talented man in his field, and was the correct choice for the role of the Chinese bad guy. His eyes make him look especially bad, and his movements are just amazing. I also liked his performance in the movie Romeo Must Die, where he continues his martial arts role even more, with the beautiful Aaliyah.Once again the main characters stand up for a final time. Glover and Gibson pair up superbly as the cop partners. One of the classics quotes from the whole film would have to be when, Uncle Benny tells Riggs in his Chinese shop that ` it's fried rice you Plick', a terrific line. Those two have gone through a lot together, and what a ride it had for their audiences. I have loved every bit of it. Yet the funniest role of the whole series belongs to funny man, Joe Pesci. Leo Getz is a crazy character and he had me in stitches again in Lethal Weapon 4. The scene where he talks about the mobile phones is hilarious,  They f#*k you with the cell phones' what a line! New man to this film is comedian, Chris Rock. His role was another funny one, especially the way he sucks up to Sargent Murtaugh. I am looking forward to seeing more movie roles of Rock's in the future.  Again the scenes in this are just incredible. The scene on the immigration boat was great action, plus watching poor old Murtaugh get the short end of the stick was very amusing, he seems to never have any luck. The scene through Chinatown was cleverly put together and one of my favourite in the whole film. The martial art scenes in lethal weapon 4 were first class. The scene at the Murtaugh's house was just exceptional, as was the conclusion of the film, were we get to see how peeved Jet Li really can be. Also the car chase on the highway was great, it was good change from the martial arts and certainly left hanging for sometimes. Plus the scene at the dentist was very funny and just shows how crazy this lethal weapon team can be. Yet the scene at the end of the film with Leo Getz and Riggs at his wife's grave site, was something I wasn't expecting, but I thought it was beautifully written and wonderfully acted. Ok, Ok, many people have said that this Lethal weapon is the best or the worst of the series. Look I found it breathtaking in some instances, and at times very very funny. The cast's through each film in the series has been great to watch (especially with the final credits of this film and the song &#145;Why can't we be friends'), and some of the crazy scenes and antics, have been hilarious. I think people who criticise this film completely really aren't a fan of the genre, because each film has been different and makes you feel better for the viewing experience.
