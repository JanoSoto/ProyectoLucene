[{"date":"14 June 2009","score":"","review":" Election is a film that grows on you. The first time I saw it, I liked it because of its mix of teen and adult themes, both narrow and wide. But this time I looked at it from a few different angles, and it became all the more intriguing.This time I focused on the three candidates for student body president Tracy Flick (in a deviously effective performance from Reese Witherspoon), Paul Metzler (played by an equally effective Chris Klein), and Paul's sister, Tammy (a forgettable Jessica Campbell).What I focused on, was what these characters represent. What I found -- which didn't take a rocket scientist, but required a look at the big picture -- were the party alignments for each candidate. In order to recognize this you need to step out of the high school universe that's built for us in Election, and focus on the American government, in general.Tracy is the republican representative. She's conservative, old-fashioned, and wholesome on the outside. On the inside she desperately craves victory, so much so that she's willing to sacrifice her integrity. The extent of republican corruption we'll never know, but it's there nonetheless. It's there in all political parties.Paul is the democrat. The People's Choice, so to speak. When Paul gets up to make his pre-election speech, the crowd goes wild because of his background as an athletic hero. The people like him because they can relate, they feel that he's in touch with the experiences and concerns of the masses. Tracy, on the other hand, is distant. She's in her own little bubble. And still, after Paul's nervous and ultimately empty speech, the crowd is stunned. Maybe the democrat isn't the best choice, after all.Then there's Tammy. Despite the weakest acting performance of the three candidates, Campbell's character is arguably the most important. Tammy represents the wild card, the Third Party philosophy. She sees the pointlessness and silliness of it all, and uses that to appeal to the crowd. Her tactic works, as she quickly becomes the most popular candidate of the trio. We find out, in fact, that she wins the election despite being eliminated from the ballot.That seems to be director Alexander Payne's message the two-party system is limiting, and put not-so-eloquently...dumb. Payne wants more from our government; more options, more reality, and less bullshit. But he knows he won't get it. That's why he's put his name to Election -- to ease his frustration.That frustration can be seen in Jim McAllister.

The movie works perfectly as long as brassy big-city-girl Janeane Garofalo is confronted with an every-cliché-in-the-book village in the Irish boondocks. This concept stops working as soon as Janeane becomes all gooey gooey about that Irish heartthrob, which happens at about two thirds of the movie. At this point the script tries to tie up too many loose ends and performs a 180° turn towards a happy ending in which big city girl and Oirish oik find true love, the senatorial candiadate wins his election, and the hard-nosed spin doctor commits societal suicide. A bit too much cheese for my palate. Before that the movie was fresh and entertaining -- although it did pander to every cliché about the emerald isle in the book (the women all have luscious arse-length curly red hair, etc.).Stuff I didn't like*Marcy (Janeane Garofalo) harping on about how she's addicted to fax machines and the New York Times at inappropriate moments. It just makes her seem self-important and boorish.*The fact that autochtonic love interest Sean isn't just a simple Oirish country yokel but actually a cutting-edge investigative journalist who left the business because he was disgusted by the lack of ethics in the industry.*When Marcy arrives at the hotel, she is told that there aren't any rooms available. No more rooms, huh, she asks back. Nope, none whatsoever, she is told. Then they ask around every hotel in the county. Finally the landlady concedes that they do, after all, have a room with en-suite bathroom and fecking bathtub available. Funny that she didn't think of that in the first place.*That this -- for some dark reason -- was director Mark Joffe's last movie to date.Stuff I did like*How Marcy, when she is being chatted up by Sean, lowers her voice and asks him intimately Is being an idiot like being high all the time?*The acting, especially of the secondary characters, is amazing. Check out matchmaker Milo O'Shea or the local it's a filthy, FILTHY business genealogist. Jay O'Sanders and Dennis Leary also make an amazing couple as the nit-witted senator and his ruthless adviser.
