The portal between the Matrix and supposed to be the real world was extremely ridiculous, old phones ringing and that's it? seriously??? While the whole thing is pure fiction, within the boundaries of that fiction, audience expects to receive a reasonably believable action and\/or explanation and in case of the portal, the thing is so cheap that is beyond any explanation so maybe that's why they just left it unexplained and I thank them for not attempting to insult my intelligence. It was 1930s cheap!2. Apparently the director(s) were into antiques. Old Lincoln car, old phones, old TVs... I love antiques too but using those stuff in the movie was like an unmatched patch on hole on pair of jeans! Some may find it fashionable but I say its just irrelevant, and it was an irrelevancy overdone!3. To elicit emotion in a good screenplay, hero and villain(s) should be fundamentally the same and that similarity should be explained early in the movie otherwise there would be no elicited emotion on audience side as a result of their conflict. In this movie there was absolutely no similarity between the hero and villain except a cheesy explanation near the end of movie which aside from being so cheesy, it was also too late and as a result, confrontations between Nemo and the agent throughout the movie were among the most senseless I've ever seen on big screen. It was good action (for year 1999) but that was it! no emotion, no excitement!4. Villains had no weakness(es). They could virtually do anything, there was no limit to their power. On scree writing point, the villain(s) of the movie were pure disaster and at the end, Nemo was dead! So he came to life again after the kiss of the true love (thank you for making me laugh a bit) and all the sudden he became the one who could do anything better that villains and destroyed them... really???If I want to explain this movie in a short sentence I would say I was a giant pimp truck running on mini copper tire on rear left, 18 wheeler tire of on rear right, regular truck tire on front left and no tire at all on front right! yes, it was that bad and yet it was successful because of the action and relatively innovative special effects for a time. Also for those who claim that the movie was philosophical... No it was not. The story was not new and there were numerous books and movies on the subject of what if this world is just a dream.

After all, it sounded like an interesting movie.Interested indeed.What Dreams May Come appears to be a 'New Age' rendition of the after life as well as a commentary or reflection on dealing with life and death. A fitting movie considering the events of recent times.Although the movie was ascetically excellent (for a 1998 film even!) it seemed to lack a smooth flow of events. I could not help but notice as I watched that the movie was hard to follow with events seeming to be pieced together, although not bad enough to where I would lose a sense of what the film was trying to communicate. Some of the concepts that I picked up on in this movie were as follows- Theme of Holding on and Letting Go. - Never giving up in this life or the next. - Life as well as the after life is all about 'ME'. - Heaven and Hell are all of MY making. If one adhere's to the popular American cult of 'The Secret' and other New-Age ideas, then 'What Dreams May Come' will be an interesting experience. However, if one does not buy into the New Age experience, then this movie will be lacking. This film is very 'American' in the sense that it communicates that one ought to be entitled to happiness in this life and the next. Our main character played by Williams loses his children, but eventually gains them back in the after-life. Although they choose to appear in a way that will satisfy him. He then later loses his wife, and treks to Hell to win her back where they both eventually have some seeming form of happiness. Then, at the end, they choose to be 'reborn' into the earth to pursue happiness again - I.E. try to seek each other out all over again. Therefore everything in their reality is based on them and their ability to find happiness. It is almost as if life\/death is portrayed as cyclic as well as a cosmic thrill ride where we can choose to do what we want based on our own whims\/desires. In this film Heaven and hell are based upon our ability to let go of life or not let go of life and be self-absorbed in our own version of life. Although there are apparently other ways to achieve hell, but they are not described in the film as to not offend anyone. This film does not deal with the reality\/existence of God in the afterlife. For that reason it is lacking in my opinion!Overall the message of the film is hard to follow, but the ascetic value is high.

They need to be re-watched. They're worth it.This time; Dances with Wolves, brought to us by a very wise and brilliant young actor (at that time) called Kevin Costner (you've probably heard of him!)NB This was what turned Kevin Costner into gold dust for a few years (remember Robin Hood Prince of Thieves). Costner was King Midas basically until his sparkly, shiny star reached its apogee with his untimely filmic demise in the utterly ridiculous and overblown (and over-budget) Waterworld. (Holds head in hands; Kevin what were you thinking!)I fell in love with Dances With Wolves in 1990 and then recently again when I tried to force my 13 and 15 year old to watch it. Their response was the inauspicious; It's a bit boring dad, as they vacated the sofa 32 minutes in. But I contend here Calum and Adam that you're just not quite ready for it yet and don't be surprised if it cycles round again sneakily one Friday Family Film Night soon. Dances With Wolves is genius, a slim novel of 1988 vintage written by Michael Blake with his eyes on a possible screenplay prize, it was bought hook, line and sinker by Costner who yummed it up so much he starred, directed and drummed up the finance for it over the next few years. It became Costner's labour of love and at the same time he re-invented the Western form for Hollywood so they could fall in love with it again in a post-modern way with a whole lot less stubble and a whole lot more human heart.Dances With Wolves has Oscar written all over it and I fell head over in heels in love with it when I was a (still extremely naive and immature) twenty-two year old. Where to start then on this gorgeous-fest of love, hope, humanity and sheer cinematographical brilliance?Is it with Timmons the hapless mule-train driver who first takes the naive and idealistic John Dunbar (the solider fresh from the horrors of the Civil War) that Costner plays out to the Frontier, a sea of prairie where so-called civilisation hasn't reached yet? (Poor Timmons dies brutally - and brilliantly - the victim of some Pawnee Indians tracking back to their home-lands after a patrol. His scalping is so visceral we can almost hear (at an appropriate distance) the skin unzipping from the skull!)Or perhaps we should start with Kicking Bird (played by Graham Greene) the thoughtful and wise young brave who first visits the decimated Fort Sedgwick after John Dunbar first arrives.Or perhaps it is simply the vast, swaying grasslands of the mid-west, an ocean of Buffalo for mile upon mile? A landscape the sky was invented for, a landscape to put us in our mortal place.Or perhaps it's the sweeping John Barry soundtrack or incredible long, lugubrious shoots of the Dakota Badlands and the in-your-face wilderness of a country as yet untamed.At root the reason why so many of us love this film is the production values for the whole project, from cinematography through to the language coaching the Native American actors underwent so they spoke Lakota convincingly. Everything on this movie is sumptuous (except perhaps the budget, note to self Mr Costner) and it is strong and powerful theme of the story, revisited endlessly in mini-echoes throughout its three hour duration, that brings home such a resounding narrative success. Dances With Wolves works because the story is simple and straight as a Pawnee arrow and it strikes right to our hearts. It is about what we truly are, as individuals and as a species. It is about heart and head, family, connections and the wisdom of living together with tolerance and in harmony with our world. It is about the wind in our hair and the sun on our backs, it is about simply being as opposed to being something.The story is a back-to-nature tale of John Dunbar's gradual re-education about the so-called Savages the great White Man is expunging from America's heartland. It is an Alice Through The Looking Glass narrative where Dunbar very soon realizes, whilst amongst the metaphorical wolves of the title, it is his own kind, White Man, who are the savages. The story of this film was totally ripped off in Avatar, same idea, just with eleven foot smurf aliens and some eye-popping CGI. What Dances With Wolves has in spades which its newer and bluer rip off didn't (and I totally loved Avatar too) is that it helped reinforce a revisionist tack on the Great American West, actually much more like genocide than a heap of swaggering John Wayne gunslingers ever let on. Of course the Native American life-style is romanticized in this film, the wars between tribes, the pointless politics and the diseases and famines of a neolithic society are all glossed over, but we can forgive all that. It's ultimately an extended apology for all the Cowboy and Indians nonsense that went gone before. The Wild in West was the White Man's rapacious and violent land-grab and in Dances With Wolves we get to see that barbarism from the other end of the telescope. Not pretty or pleasant, but a truer account than most Westerns.Go on, buy it again and re-watch it.

Everything on this movie is sumptuous (except perhaps the budget, note to self Mr Costner) and it is strong and powerful theme of the story, revisited endlessly in mini-echoes throughout its three hour duration, that brings home such a resounding narrative success. Dances With Wolves works because the story is simple and straight as a Pawnee arrow and it strikes right to our hearts. It is about what we truly are, as individuals and as a species. It is about heart and head, family, connections and the wisdom of living together with tolerance and in harmony with our world. It is about the wind in our hair and the sun on our backs, it is about simply being as opposed to being something.The story is a back-to-nature tale of John Dunbar's gradual re-education about the so-called Savages the great White Man is expunging from America's heartland. It is an Alice Through The Looking Glass narrative where Dunbar very soon realizes, whilst amongst the metaphorical wolves of the title, it is his own kind, White Man, who are the savages. The story of this film was totally ripped off in Avatar, same idea, just with eleven foot smurf aliens and some eye-popping CGI. What Dances With Wolves has in spades which its newer and bluer rip off didn't (and I totally loved Avatar too) is that it helped reinforce a revisionist tack on the Great American West, actually much more like genocide than a heap of swaggering John Wayne gunslingers ever let on. Of course the Native American life-style is romanticized in this film, the wars between tribes, the pointless politics and the diseases and famines of a neolithic society are all glossed over, but we can forgive all that. It's ultimately an extended apology for all the Cowboy and Indians nonsense that went gone before. The Wild in West was the White Man's rapacious and violent land-grab and in Dances With Wolves we get to see that barbarism from the other end of the telescope. Not pretty or pleasant, but a truer account than most Westerns.Go on, buy it again and re-watch it. It deepens our humanity and succeeds in upsetting me deeply every single time I watch it.***** (Five Stars) ","genre":"Adventure, Drama, Western"},{"date":"17 August 2014","score":"4 out of 7 people found the following review useful","review":" There are no set qualities for a great film. Some movies like Citizen Kane are towering Cathedrals, crowned with outstanding lead performances, their every shot awash with gravitas and innovation, two hour pieces of high art with relatively simple stories. Other films are great stories, superbly told, like The Shawshank Redemption, Braveheart and Slumdog Milllionaire. And then there are films like this one which are a joyous, fun celebration of all the things we love about movies and film making.Every scene of this is fun and enjoyable. A rollicking chase between two rival archaeologists as they travel all over the world (the film using world maps so we can keep track of the action) in search of the mystical ark of the covenant. Throw in some Nazis, snake phobia, cutting edge (for the time) special effects, a damsel in distress and the Saturday matinée feel and you have an adventure film like no other to that point in time.For star Harrison Ford, this film, on the back of his turn as Han Solo in an expanded role in 1980's The Empire Strikes Back confirmed his status as the pre eminent leading man of his time, and from the start, this is his movie. We follow his adventures for an inordinate number of minutes before the director shows us his face, we see him fearlessly tackle big hairy spiders, leaps of doom, deadly arrows and rolling stone balls before the film is 15 minutes old. We also see him lose his first big battle on screen with his rival Belloq. And in those first 15 minutes we learn everything we need to about his character and the film. Indy is fearless, principled, a bit of a screw up and not a particularly good archaeologist. No wonder he has to work as a teacher to pay the bills. From that point on he becomes all things to all people. The film rarely lets up on the action, with chase after chase, and usually ending in Indy being outwitted by his smarter, better resourced rival.Ford is absolutely superb. While I personally believe that the film still would have been a success had Spielberg's original choice for the role, Tom Selleck, been available, it is now impossible to see anyone else in the role. Spielberg has also surrounded Ford with a great supporting cast including Denholm Elliott, John Rhys Davies, Paul Freeman, Karen Allen and Ronald Lacey, as well as a very young Alfred Molina. Allen in particular is great as the love interest\/ damsel in distress.The effects, for the time were breathtaking, bringing the settings alive and nearly making us believe that the Nazis faces are melting at the film's end. Some of the blue screen shots leave a little to be desired, but it was still fairly early in the evolution of that film making technology, and so these are forgivable. The set pieces are expertly realized and the fight scenes well choreographed.In the end Raiders is the finest example of the adventure genre, made the more entertaining for the fact that our protagonist is not a particularly successful adventurer. It has enough silly to be fun, without being stupid and remains, more than 30 years on, as one of the most entertaining films not just of its era, but in all of American cinema.

Before he starred in Cliffhanger, he starred in a number of flops such as Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot and Oscar. For some reason, Stallone somehow lost his way in the movie world and got stuck making forgettable flops like those two movies. My best guess is that either his next film will be a hit or a miss. And to tell you the truth, Cliffhanger is definitely an hit, an huge hit for the box office.Stallone plays an rescue mountain climber who, in the beginning of the movie, is trying to rescue his friend, Hal Tucker, (Michael Rooker), and his girlfriend from an mountain. Unfortunately, the rescue attempt doesn't go smoothly as the clip on Rooker's girlfriend snaps and slips through the harness. She falls to her death down an gorge, leaving both Rooker and Stallone, devastated.Months later, Stallone is living by himself, away from his other friend, played by Janine Turner. Stallone is scarred for life because of what happened months ago with the death of Rooker's girlfriend death. However, he continues to climbs mountains anyway.The centerpiece of the story involves an group of villains, lead by John Lithgow. Their plan is to rob an U.S. Treasury plane with three cases holding millions of dollars. Their high-altitude plan goes completely wrong when their plane crash lands in the Rocky Mountains, leaving the bad guys, stranded in the snowy wilderness. Seeking help, they radioed help from the local mountain rescue center. Soon enough, Stallone and Rooker finds themselves caught up with the bad guys as they are being used by the villains to help find their stolen loot in the Mountains.The great thing about Cliffhanger is it's mountain climbing scenes. I actually started to believe that these actors were really climbing an mountain, instead of climbing an fake mountain that was build on a studio set. These are real mountains, all right. With that being said, the action sequences are well directed although I had a hard time believing in the way the bad guys were able to get the three cases into their plane while trying to fly their plane through the high altitude. Most of the action sequences in Cliffhanger are so energetic and sometimes scary due to the fact that some of the bad guys fall off the mountain. And when these characters are leaning over the edge of the mountains in some of the scenes in the movie, I was actually afraid that they would fall.The movie was directed by Renny Harlin, who directed the second Die Hard movie and he does a very good job creating an stunning visual sensation with the beautiful shots of the canyons and gorges. The movie was shot in the Rocky Mountains in Colorado and the use of the locations in the movie are very useful as a setting for a movie like this. I couldn't really picture myself climbing those mountains by hanging off the side of it. For those who know what I am talking about, it pretty scary.Stallone is okay as the lead character. He tries his best to not only play an action hero, but an flawed one, too. The best performance comes from John Lithgow, who plays the leader of the group. His British accent and his ways of taking people out of his plan is very sadistic, making him the perfect villain. He is maybe different from the villain in Harlin's last film, Die Hard 2, but Lithgow does a very good job playing the bad guy who doesn't take chances.With the exception of Cliffhanger, I could only say that Stallone is mild in this movie. He isn't really that great, but at least give him credit for trying to become an flawed character. That's important because we've seen Stallone play heroes before like Rocky Balboa or John Rambo. Those characters are like superhuman characters that are meant to win in the end of the movie. Here, it turns an different direction. It's interesting to see him tackle this kind of role because it's surprising and interesting. As for the action sequences and the mountain scenes, those scenes will have you admiring the breath- taking views of the Rockies. I will say though that this movie might even give you vertigo because of the scenes involving climbing especially the beginning of the movie which is clearly authentic. ★★★ 3 stars.

I got pulled in.The storyline was still the same but I had a better appreciation for it. I could see the commentary on scientific advances (something the author of the book was famous for) but I could look past them and just enjoy the movie. I didn't think about how they cut out this one really cool scene or the fact that Lex was supposed to be younger than Tim. I just watched. Sam Neill is wonderful as is Jeff Goldblum. The dinosaurs looked good and I'm not just talking about for that time. It was before the serious CG move and they were robots but somehow that just made them work better. I mean, dinosaurs aren't really known for their vast variety of facial expressions.The soundtrack is perfect and created a new theme for my generation. My parents had Indiana Jones and Star Wars. We had Jurassic Park. I won't go on about the social and scientific commentaries in the movie because it could ruin it for you if you haven't considered them. It also helps that it boosted Spielberg's career. He wasn't exactly unknown at the time but it was definitely a step in the right direction for him and helped set him up to take on new projects (Schindler's List among them).All in all, it's not called a classic because everything is perfect.

The first time I witnessed it, I was twelve and I had just finished reading the book. I was devastated. They cut out so much and my poor little twelve year old brain couldn't understand why they couldn't fit EVERYTHING in the movie. Later I understood the need to cut stuff out but I was still angry over the fact that Hammond was supposed to die at the end of the story. It was the best death scene and they nixed it.Then a few years ago, I caught the movie while channel surfing.

This film has many unexplained plots, why is there another portal to the MRR? In 1999 draft script of the movie, yes there's a Director's cut, the MRR is a railway system, but why keep the portal scene in the final product? The whole magic concept is ridiculous and stupid when it comes to the world of Thomas the Tank Engine. The show, when it was first seen 30 years ago on British TV, were based on a series of books made by the Rev.W.Awdry called 'The Railway Series', the books shows us the engines of Sodor working on the railway with real railway practice.

Britt Allcroft, the former producer of the series, thinks the characters in a magical point of view and while I do respect her, this would be her awful decision. The movie ignored the British roots of the series and it made Sodor more universal rather then a fictional island being part of the real world.

The voice actors for the engines, no offense towards American and Canadians, were bad as it gives the tag 'Americanisation' towards Thomas the Tank Engine, even American and Canadian purists of Thomas hate this movie too, most of them are Canadians and Americans impersonating the British accent with Britt Allcroft being the voice of Lady as the only British VA. The DC was to have some British and one Australian VA but was kicked out of it because an L.A test audience think they sound either too old or scary. The human characters are OK Alec Baldwin and Mara Wilson were good but Peter Fonda just over acts depressed, even though many kids films do have sad scenes but Fonda's more depressive.

And that's why the rhino's going to get exactly what he deserves. Death to Smoochy is a mix of Barney the Dinosaur and over the top gangster films. Death to Smoochy is an acquired taste, that has since release, got a large cult follow. In no way is the movie perfect, this movie does take something so sacred like kid-televisions shows host, and turn it incredibly dark. Most of the characters are pretty unlikeable and mean-spirited, and their turn around to good, a bit far-fetch, but I have to say, that the movie isn't trying to be squeaky clean, it's trying to show that even the greater of good can still fall in the mud. The movie felt like a remake of 1939's Mr. Smith goes to Washington with its similar plot. The movie is about, a good-All American boy, named Sheldon Mopes AKA Smoochy (Edward Norton) who is hired by a network station to replace, corrupt children's television show host, Rainbow Randolph (Robin Williams) whom just got busted for taking bribes. It's seem like the television producers, M. Frank Stokes (Jon Stewart) & Nora Wells (Catherine Keener) charged with finding a squeaky clean replacement for Randolph, under-establish how squeaky clean, Sheldon is, as he's not willing to forsake any events that is funded by criminals such as the Parade of Hope, who hide under a charity organization. Now, Sheldon must try to keep his 'I want to do good, mentality believable, under the pressure of the harsh realism of corruption, leaded by attacks from both Rainbow Randolph, Parade of Hope, and the Network. Making a dark comedy is difficult to write, it's so easy to slip into a really depressing drama, or horror, if not handled correctly. I think the movie is well-written. It is crass, crude, and hilarious. It shows the depths of ugliness, but isn't too mean-spirited to be unlikeable. Still, whatever commentary there was supposed to be about American mass media consumerism didn't really come through right. Without the great gifted acting from both Edward Norton and Robin Williams, this movie wouldn't had work. Edward Norton's Sheldon Mopes is a lovable and friendly character that's so nice, so friendly, so naive, he played all those layers of the character so well we start to believe a guy like that can really exist! He was a bit annoying at times, but overall, he did great as the moral stone needed for this film to work. Robin Williams is just ridiculous, most of his jokes were funny as hell. This is the first role, in a long time of playing the good guy in the 1990s, that he was alright as the rude and irascible with a propensity for violence, type of a bad guy. The supporting cast was just as funny as them. I love the character of Spinner Dunn (Michael Rispoli). He was such a lovable funny character. The witty one-liners, harsh physical comedy and dark, biting tone force the audience to laugh out loud while squirming in their seats. Still, it's weird that Neo-Nazis are huge fans of a cartoony rhino. The music that goes with the film is just absurd, but great to hear; Step-father, one of Moochy's songs about being patient with mom's new husband, is pure brilliance. Even the Friends Come in All Sizes, song by Robin William is pretty impression with the opening tap dance. The whole ice dance event toward the end was very well-done. I got buzzed off of orange juice watching it. Death to Smoochy is known for its outwardly vulgar and profane humor, particularly Williams' profound cursing outbursts throughout the film. I wouldn't say, this movie should be watch, by children, at all. It was unfair of critics to call it one of the worst of the year. Overall Death to Smoochy is screwed up satire, but in a squeamishly delightful kind of way. Plus, for those of you who harbor a secret, pent-up, homicidal hatred of Barney, will love this movie. Death to Smoochy can't change the world but it did made a dent in some people lives. I was surprised to find that this film has so many rabid fans.

Overall Death to Smoochy is screwed up satire, but in a squeamishly delightful kind of way. Plus, for those of you who harbor a secret, pent-up, homicidal hatred of Barney, will love this movie. Death to Smoochy can't change the world but it did made a dent in some people lives. I was surprised to find that this film has so many rabid fans.

The story opens showing a convicted bank robber Carl Quigley (Miguel Ferrer) escape from prison, to which he immediately obtains a million dollars he had hidden for quite sometime. Before long, we meet ten-year-old Preston Waters (Brian Bonsall), who finds himself constantly pushed around by his investment-banker father, who continues to bask in the light of frugality. After receiving a blank check from his grandmother, Preston asks his dad to fill it out, to which he puts down only $11.00. All Preston wants is a little spending money so he can buy some toys and feel like he has some sort of freedom, rather than being confined to anything other than pocket change.One day, Preston is riding his bike in a parking lot and winds up being struck by Quigley, who doesn't have time to stick around and fill out police reports, so gives Preston a blank check and tells it to give it to his father, presumably to pay for the bike since Preston is unharmed. Rather than giving it to his father, Preston recalls the blank check of his grandmother's and decides to cash it for $1,000,000. Before he knows it, Preston is filthy rich at the expense of Quigley, who, along with his goons, now needs to track down a kid while struggling to adhere to his criminal plan. Meanwhile, Preston lives the dream, buying a house, numerous accessories, and all the materials he could ever want.Anyone who says they didn't dream of something like this, or tries to shout at Preston for being materialistic, is ridiculous. Preston's attitude is no different than a lot of us when we were younger, whether we'd like to admit it or not. Not to mention, Preston acts entirely on impulse throughout the entire film, as most of us did when we were younger, providing situational realism. The kid isn't a god-child who would donate all the money to charity, nor is he using his money to try and manipulate and control others. He is a kid acting out his dream of having enough wealth to live without the worries or authority of his parents chiming in and ruining his fun, and I don't know what kid didn't want that kind of security growing up.Blank Check also, some way, somehow, manages to sustain a romantic relationship between a young kid and an older woman in a surprisingly genial, refreshing manner. Early in the film, Preston meets the gorgeous Shay Stanley (Karen Duffy), a bank teller for the bank Preston winds up cashing his check at. Preston quickly falls in lust with Shay, mainly for her elegant conversations and her radiant appearance, and tries to sustain something of a romantic relationship with her, even though all signs point to impossibility. In unsteady hands, this relationship could've been cheap and exploitative. Under the care and attention of director Rupert Wainwright and writers Blake Snyder and Colby Carr emerges a more gentler focus on the relationship, one that isn't haphazardly strung-along by nonsensical one-liners, but deep-rooted intimacy, despite both parties knowing they can't carry this on forever.Finally, there seems to be a lot of criticism with Preston's character being a brat. If one refers to Preston as a brat, then one must refer to Kevin from the Home Alone serious a brat as well. Preston is a character who simply wants some freedom and some liberties, which are not offered by his parents, so when he finally gets the opportunity to take responsibility and encounters his own finances, he is acting out on one of his oldest fantasies. If he's a brat because he wants a little leeway and space, then I suppose we were all brats at one point.Finally, there's the ending, which, like the remainder of the film, comes under certain scrutiny because the lead character allegedly doesn't learn anything. Blank Check's ending is quiet and low-key, never over-emphasizing the idea that now Preston appreciates all he had back when life was simpler. Had the ending been louder and more sentimentalized, it would still be criticized for its sappy handling of what should've been a quieter ending. The criticism here is especially ridiculous because, surprisingly enough for a Disney movie, Blank Check doesn't embellish its conclusion nor its character. It simply comes to a quiet, personal realization, evident enough for the audience to pick up, and concludes. As far as I'm concerned, the biggest issue with the film is its datedness, seeing as how the house Preston acquires would be enough to bankrupt him alone, even with one million dollars.Starring Brian Bonsall, Karen Duffy, and Miguel Ferrer.

They were pretty over-the-top, but I guess that's what we loved about them. And, I dare say that the writer\/star of 'Austin Powers International Man of Mystery,' - Mike Myers - loves them as much as the rest of us. For he gives us a most loving take on the unspoken absurdities that we deliberately chose to overlook in the Bond films. He plays both hero and villain here as a swinging spy, frozen in the sixties and defrosted in the - rather more politically correct - nineties to do battle with the (Blofeld-like) Dr Evil.Despite being an American production, it has a very British feel to it. Everything is made fun of, but you never feel like they're being particularly cruel - it's all quite 'loving mockery' (if you know what I mean). It's not just a string of naughty jokes, but it also does go a little deeper in highlighting the change in attitudes from the 'free love' of the sixties to the more reserved nineties.There's nothing here that's particularly clever, just a stream of innuendos which seem like they've been taken straight out of the original Carry On films. But, if you're in the mood for some general silliness (and have a healthy knowledge of the old Bond films), you should enjoy the crazy ride and find you're spouting the several Powers\/Evil catchphrases for some time to come.http\/\/thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk\/ ","genre":null},{"date":"17 August 2014","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Looking back on it, it was amazing that no one thought of completely lampooning those old Sean Connery Bond films until 1997.

With so much so good about this there isn't much stuff wrong with it and criticism does not come easy. It is well acted, comedic but also ultimately reaches extreme new emotions for a film series and a sequel that really touches whatever you already knew about film. Overall I felt it was a masterpiece, and here below is why. The story is an epic one and plots just about everything you want to see when spaceships are flying round perfectly. This one also works so well in the entire series as a whole and without this only really episode IV would be ground breaking, it just combines action, adventure and comedy into a bundle of greatness. On that note of comedy, although the plot is very dramatic, you get that one two between characters that is just superb to see and reinvents old clichés. The main cast return to good form and probably even better than before, Mark Hamill improves and although he isn't as good as he probably should be, he controls the role well. Harrison Ford yet again puts in a sublime acting display and his skills seen here are reason enough why film is so important to some people. I did feel Carrie Fisher also gets a little better from previously seen and when ever her and Ford are on screen there timing is brilliantly done.George Lucas doesn't direct or write this one and it could be said it benefits because of that, Irwin Kershner does direct it well although the real star behind the camera is Lawrence Kasdan who along with Leigh Brackett create a script that has to be one of the best ever seen in film, just so well written all the way through. I even think the effects improve overall and some spectacular space scenes make this also as well deeply dramatic, also heart raising.Criticisms well I said about how hard it is so let's try and find some. The only thing I can think of is occasionally parts can seem rather silly, Vader sometimes has really random sets used with him and overly extravagant offices. At times the effects are not good but it was 1980 so I can't criticise it for that at all.Fans of Star Wars well, this should be there favourite one and although some come close, it is still overall the best movie in the series. If you like Sci-Fi, this is even worth it as a one off watch and even if you have never seen a Star Wars film before, this will still entertain. The only people I think who would dislike this are people who really don't like Sci-Fi as that is the only thing I can think of if you don't at least find it kind of OK.Overall it is more or less a Just About Flawless film and one that is essential viewing for any fan of all things film. It appears on so many best films of all time lists and can even top them at times so don't go in thinking you might not like it, give it a go and Empire may just come out being your favourite film of all time. I also will add that if anyone ever needs to see what the best type of acting is then watch this movie, all the cast just seem perfect and even the extras can seem brilliant.

Avildsen as a Frank Capra style story of a New Jersey kid who moves to tropical California only to be shunned as an outsider who lives on the wrong side of town. The movie is still enjoyable and in 1984 made a tremendous impact on the movie-going public. Like the Black Stallion in 1979, it became something of a classic movie for young people.The kid, played by Ralph Macchio, finds some strong support in his always devoted mother, who is determined to make a new life. However, the real anchor is the building superintendent and new found friend Mr. Miyagi, played by Pat Morita. Miyagi is a wise elder, who creates bonsais and teaches the young man how to defend himself by mastering karate and its true values. Martin Kove plays the negative adult role model for the gang of kids who terrorize Daniel with their macho karate, not the form of self-defence that Miyagi promotes. I think the show is still great entertainment. The show reaches a Rocky-style climax and you can probably guess how it turns out. It can be faulted for a formula plot but is still good enough to hold your attention and reflect on the values of mutual respect and ethical conduct that often don't register with parents and their teens.
