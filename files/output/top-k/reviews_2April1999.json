Jennifer Love Hewitt and Freddie Prinze Jr. are back along with Brandy, Mekhi Pfifer, and Matthew Settle. I knew that Freddie Prinze Jr. was going to be in the sequel; but when he made his first appearance on screen it was if I was seeing my best friend for the first time after a long while. Jennifer Love Hewitt exhibited such beauty in this film as she does in every acting role she takes; also, she makes the acting look so easy. She is sight for sore eyes every time she's on the screen. For the most part, the additional cast members did a great job. Though Brandy has acting talent, I wish that I could have seen Sarah Michelle Gellar in the sequel; Sarah had such screen presence with her beauty and style I didn't want her to go the way she did in the first movie. There was a twist in this movie that there wasn't in the prequel or Scream that surprised me and felt was a valuable addition to the script.

Is it possible for an important member of the mafia to develop a conscience? I don't know, but that really isn't the issue here. For some reason, before I saw this film I was led to the assumption that Robert DeNiro had developed a conscience, and could no longer act out the violet nature of his world. This isn't true, at least not for awhile. Paul Vitti (DeNiro) has developed what I make out to be a major depressive episode, marked by symptoms of anxiety. They don't really ever say in the movie. They go as far as saying that he has 'panic attacks'. I find it funny how the true nature of a mental illness is never depicted quite accurately in movies. Anyway, it is this that is inhibiting Paul from performing as a top notch gangster. Aside from all this, we have a movie that has many funny moments, some hilarious and some that just make you chuckle.Having a background in psychology, naturally I found the Freudian discussion between Ben (Billy Crystal) and Paul just downright hilarious. First of all I found it funny because it is so typical of therapists in movies to use Freudian psychodynamic therapy. In the real world, Freudian concepts are rarely used, even though they are the likely the best know. This is why films thrive on them. The scene was also funny when Ben tried to explain to Paul, the Oedipal Complex. Paul's reaction was priceless. Have you seen my mother????, he exclaims.Also noteworthy, is a scene near the end where Ben has to go to a mafia meeting because Paul is having a breakdown. His impersonation of the 'Italian' gangster is very funny. I have heard that the whole scene improvised on the spot. I am not positive if that is true or not, but either way, thumbs up to Billy Crystal.Robert DeNiro's performance as Paul Vitti is great. He reprises his hard edged gangster persona that we are all so familiar with from films like Scorsese's Goodfellas and Casino. Maybe that's why it is so funny, and almost unbelievable when we see him cry. To me, DeNiro seems like the kind of guy that you could never make cry.Overall, the film has many cliches that have been reproduced time and time again, and the ending is not much of a surprise, but I guess with a film like this, I found myself not really caring much about that. I laughed and had a good time; sometimes that's all you need. *** out of **** ","genre":null},{"date":"2 April 1999","score":"","review":"  In Analyze This, Robert DeNiro plays a gangster (as usual), who seems to be getting to a point where his work is making him fall apart.

At 155 minutes, it crawls along like a snake, but it never rattles and doesn't bite.  Kevin Spacey is perfectly cast as Jim Williams, the Southern gentleman accused of murdering his male lover (Jude Law, very good in Gattaca), and the Lady Chablis, the drag queen, offers a good imitation of herself, but who needs John Cusack as a reporter, a stand-in for Berendt? The music is again credited to Lennie Neihaus, Eastwood's long-time composer, but since the bulk of the score is devoted to Johnny Mercer songs, what did Neihaus do?  (Considering that Eastwood wrote Claudia's Theme for Unforgiven and Doe Eyes, the theme for The Bridges of Madison County, what does Neihaus ever contribute to the score of Eastwood's films?) Perhaps the best song, Come Rain or Come Shine, is rendered instantly forgettable as warbled by Allison Eastwood (considering her complete lack of presence, nepotism, not talent, must be on her side).This failed film just may be an example of miscasting behind the camera.

Here, he continues the wearying pseudo-intellectual tone of that earlier film, but while Annie Hall compensated for its pretentions with an abundance of humor, much of it aimed at pseudo-intellectuals (Allen apparently does not recognize himself as a member of this group), the laughs in Manhattan (and there are plenty of them) are unintentional.

I'm beautiful, I'm bright, and I deserve better, Keaton says at one point, but her self-assessment would be more accurately applied to Meryl Streep who, as the wife who dumps Allen for another woman, IS beautiful, bright, and certainly deserving of something better than this mess concocted by a man whose character is described as someone who longed to be an artist but balked at the necessary sacrifices.  In Manhattan, Allen balks like never before, dishing up superficially deep subject matter, but lacking the insight and, I suspect, the experience, to adequately probe it.

Five acts of a man trying to decide whether or not to kill his uncle or not?  Seemed like overkill to me.  But upon further reading, I grew to really appreciate the play.  I've seen the Olivier and Gibson movie versions(and part of the Nicol Williamson version), and all of them take their model from Olivier; the melancholy Dane.  Olivier at least did it without being self-indulgent about it, but Gibson and, from what I saw, Williamson, looked like they went to the Look, Ma, I'm acting!  I'm acting! school.Now here comes Kenneth Branagh's version, which is breathtaking from start to finish.  It finished #2 on my top ten of 1996(behind THE ENGLISH PATIENT, and ahead of LONE STAR, JERRY MAGUIRE, FARGO, SECRETS & LIES, EVERYONE SAYS I LOVE YOU, FLIRTING WITH DISASTER, BIG NIGHT, and LOOKING FOR RICHARD), and it's the best Hamlet, and maybe the best Shakespeare, put to film. Obviously, Branagh's talents as a filmmaker, for making the full-length version, in 70mm print, and not losing our interest for four hours, is great, but what seems to get overlooked in discussions about this film is his performance in the title role.  This was my favorite performance of the year by far.  Branagh avoids the melodrama which actors seem to get trapped in by playing Hamlet as a normal, regular human being, and makes us understand his actions and feelings each step of the way.  And unlike Olivier, who depended mostly on his voice, Branagh uses his entire body to demonstrate the range of emotions that Hamlet goes through, but since he plays him as normal, none of it seems like scenery-chewing.The rest of the cast is top-notch as well.  I didn't even mind Jack Lemmon, though I agree he was the weakest member of the cast.  The most surprising turn came from Charlton Heston; I've always found him stiff as a board, but he's quite commanding as the Player King.  The other big surprise was Billy Crystal; I thought I'd find him all wrong as the 1st Gravedigger, but he was his usual funny self while being in character.  All in all, a glorious film!

Five acts of a man trying to decide whether or not to kill his uncle or not?  Seemed like overkill to me.  But upon further reading, I grew to really appreciate the play.  I've seen the Olivier and Gibson movie versions(and part of the Nicol Williamson version), and all of them take their model from Olivier; the melancholy Dane.  Olivier at least did it without being self-indulgent about it, but Gibson and, from what I saw, Williamson, looked like they went to the Look, Ma, I'm acting!  I'm acting! school.Now here comes Kenneth Branagh's version, which is breathtaking from start to finish.  It finished #2 on my top ten of 1996(behind THE ENGLISH PATIENT, and ahead of LONE STAR, JERRY MAGUIRE, FARGO, SECRETS & LIES, EVERYONE SAYS I LOVE YOU, FLIRTING WITH DISASTER, BIG NIGHT, and LOOKING FOR RICHARD), and it's the best Hamlet, and maybe the best Shakespeare, put to film. Obviously, Branagh's talents as a filmmaker, for making the full-length version, in 70mm print, and not losing our interest for four hours, is great, but what seems to get overlooked in discussions about this film is his performance in the title role.  This was my favorite performance of the year by far.  Branagh avoids the melodrama which actors seem to get trapped in by playing Hamlet as a normal, regular human being, and makes us understand his actions and feelings each step of the way.  And unlike Olivier, who depended mostly on his voice, Branagh uses his entire body to demonstrate the range of emotions that Hamlet goes through, but since he plays him as normal, none of it seems like scenery-chewing.The rest of the cast is top-notch as well.  I didn't even mind Jack Lemmon, though I agree he was the weakest member of the cast.

It became clear afterwards that the outrageousness of the idea could lend itself to more humor-orientated sequels and that Chucky himself had potential that stretched beyond just one movie.As a result, this first Child's Play movie seems to be a bit different from the rest. Don't get me wrong, the franchise is pretty good with it's continuity which is unusual for horror films, but first time around the makers played it for straight, which gives it different edge from the rest. Obviously they didn't want to play their ace right away so for the most part, Chucky is rather quiet in this one. Later on, his star would shine brighter.Chicago cop Mike Norris guns down killer Charles Lee Ray in the street, but before Ray dies he breaks into a toy store and transfers his soul into a Good Guy doll. Knowledge of Voodoo is pretty much the first thing that you're taught in serial killer class. That very same doll is given to lonely little boy Andy Barclay for his birthday, but he's not aware of the evil lurking within.Judging the film on its own merits it's not exactly the best shocker out there. There are only a couple of scare moments and a couple of those are badly timed and obviously telegraphed. The story isn't as tight as it should be and there's simply not enough kills. The sequels had bigger body counts and more interesting deaths.

I loved Absolute Power, Unforgiven, as well as his older ones The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, Fistful of Dollars, and Dirty Harry.Here, though, he perplexes me.  What's he going for with True Crime?A touching, human-interest drama?  If that, it works so-so.  We get a moving, skillful performance from Isaiah Washington.  A dependable, workmanlike leading-man from Eastwood.  James Woods is as good as he's ever been, Diane Venora is a plus as usual, and Dennis Leary can steal a scene without even trying.  On the other hand, he cast two of the worst child actors in recent memory in the roles of Washington's and Eastwood's daughters.  Also, there's a clumsily edited, acted, written, and scored scene involving Eastwood's character taking his daughter to the zoo and, being a Bad But Well-Meaning Father, screwing it up.  At the end of that scene, which must go down as the weakest directorial efforts ever to be credited to Eastwood's name, there's the obligatory shots of disapproving onlookers, probably mumbling Oh, what a bad father that guy is.  Did anyone else suspect that the entire sequence was surgically transplanted from Kramer Vs. Kramer?If it was a drama, it's not a complete one.  What else could it be--is it a comedy?  James Wood's entire performance, which includes a visual gag where he's told something so shocking he can't even bite into a Snicker's bar, seems to suggest comedy.  There's a lot of slight, peripheral attempts at humor--Eastwood seems to be telling us, Hey, this is serious, but not THAT serious. and My character may be a drunk, but he's a FUNNY drunk.Speaking of which (if you'll allow me to digress a bit), what's the drunken-driving message here?  In the beginning, a sober woman is killed in a car crash, but at another point, another character gets completely toasted and proceeds to drive with all the skill and precision of a Navy fighter pilot.  Clint, I have two less Aunts than I ought to due to a drunk driver. Why don't you pour yourself a tall one and think about that?Off the soapbox, I still admire Eastwood as a director and as an actor. He put together a hellified cast here (except, of course, those two little girls), and his story is moderately compelling.  It's serious subject matter he's tackling here, but True Crime shouldn't be taken TOO seriously. ","genre":null},{"date":"2 April 1999","score":"","review":"  I like Clint Eastwood.
