[{"date":"24 November 2000","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":"  Kevin Costner's streak of poor movies continues with this disappointing baseball film about a veteran pitcher for the Detroit Tigers and what could be his last game as a pro.  The Tigers are out of contention, the owner is going to sell the franchise, and Costner will likely be traded after the season.  Now they are in New York trying to beat the Yankees and Costner is trying to give one last glimpse of days past to himself and baseball fans.  He is pitching a perfect game and as he does so he thinks back to everything that has happened since he met the one true love of his life (Kelly Preston).  As the game progresses, more memories come to Costner and he realizes that as much as he loves baseball, he loves Preston even more.  For Love of the Game is a movie that wants to be good, but falls due to movie cliches.  Many times the flashbacks are more distracting than anything else.  Costner and Preston are the only two performers who really have substantial parts.  They both do pretty well, but the direction is never quite clear.  The screenplay was going for something like Field of Dreams, but ends up playing more like a sub-par baseball film from the 1940s or 1950s.  Overall a film that is only fair at best.  2.5 out of 5 stars.

The camera work was excellent, with many unusual angles and areas that cameras just DON'T usually get into when you are watching a mainstream release.

Hurd was (and still is) an excellent producer, and had she been involved, Titanic would have been a much better film. Anyways, I digress. As Hurd's first post T2 project (and first without Cameron), this has an awful lot of the trademark style that bore fruit in T1, Aliens, The Abyss, and T2, not to mention the participation of Lance Henriksen. At first I thought that Ray Liotta was miscast, but while his performance takes a while to get going, eventually it works well for the film. Also in exceptional form here are Kevin Dillon (annoying as hell, but he's supposed to be) and Ernie Hudson. But the real treat is the over-the top performance of Stuart Wilson, who gives us a glimpse of what Alan Rickman's performance could have been in Robin Hood Prince of Thieves had they banned Kevin Costner from the editing room. Martin Campbell proves himself to be an excellent action director, and I have no doubt that this served as an excellent calling card when he got the directing jobs on GoldenEye and The Mask of Zorro.

This one, however was just an absolute waste of time and film. The main reason for this is probably because the writer of the first two, Kevin Williamson, had nothing to do whatsoever with this film.  Originality is not a word associated with this film as it is basically just a rehash of the first two films.  The terror that viewers experienced in the first two are all gone because in this one it is obvious when the killer appears taking away all the suspense.  The storyline was also pathetic but the worst thing about this film was definitely the pathetic ending that apparently(!) explains fully the first two films.  When I found out who the killer was and what his\/her\/their motive was I actually found myself in tears of laughter at how pathetic it was.  It was obviously some quick ending written by the writer (who also wrote the brilliant 'Arlington Road') in a quick rush to get the film released while people still had interest in the series. All in all a truly terrible film saved from total condemnation by one or two fairly exciting scenes (e.g. the bit in the house with the fax machine)*1\/2 (out of *****) ","genre":null},{"date":"24 November 2000","score":"","review":"  The first two Scream films were great, original and managed to keep your interest.
