You come out feeling a bit cleaner, a good deal more jumbled, and all wet.It is a film in four parts. 1) A gang of prehumans discover how to defend their waterhole from a rival band by using bones as weapons. 2) An executive from the National Council of Astronautics visits a base on the Moon to investigate an incredible excavation find. 3) On the first manned flight to Jupiter, Astronauts Bowman and Poole have trouble with their computer assistant, HAL. 4) Bowman goes on an incredible journey beyond the known solar system and comes out the other side looking both very old and very young.Behind all these elements is the sometimes invisible, often active presence of a flat black monolith, inert in itself but capable of producing powerful reactions.What it all means, other than an often confusing 2 hours and 20 minutes, I don't know, but you have to give it up for director Stanley Kubrick. He made a film unlike any ever made, dealing with vast cosmic themes and philosophies, and it connected both with its own time and on to the present day. 2001 is still ranked the greatest sci-fi film of all time in many quarters.The images of 2001 remain powerful in isolation, and the overall story captures the evolutionary nature of man's existence in an often gripping way. But between the long shots of spacecraft docking and the odd Gregorian-style portentous chanting, the self-importance of this movie does grate, not to mention the thinness of the story.The part of the film that gets the most attention, the standoff between the astronauts and HAL, is alternately fascinating and labored. HAL seems to be ready to do to man what we saw man doing to those pig-like tapirs in Part 1, and it's up to Bowman to avoid being left behind by the evolutionary tide, not to mention being marooned in space. Long sections of astronauts moving in slow motion showcase the brilliant special effects but go on too long.What's good is very good, though, a terrific standoff between Bowman and HAL, brilliantly dramatized by actor Keir Dullea and the eerily dispassionate voice of Douglas Rain, with a chilling, powerful finale. There's even some humor. Take a stress pill and think things over is pretty funny when uttered by a killer about to get his.My favorite part of the film is the second section. Again, this features long slow-moving scenes, though used to better effect. The Strauss waltz accompanying the station-docking sequence still blows you away. William Sylvester as the Council executive, Dr. Floyd, has a striking cool efficiency about him that comes as quite a transition after the apemen in the opening. This sequence moves slowly but well to the mystery at the center of the story I was disappointed to have it over with as quickly as it was.Some may wish Kubrick dropped Part 1. I wish he had dropped Part 4, which just throws a lot of half-baked concepts in the air and doesn't bother resolving any unless you happen to read post-film interviews with Kubrick or Clarke. One long visual sequence suggests what it might be like to be trapped in a Guitar Hero game programmed by H.P. Lovecraft.The last image is supposed to be triumphant, somehow, but winds up looking lost and sad. Going up or down? Dr. Floyd asks earlier in the film. Down was what it felt like to me. 2001 is great for what it is, a brilliantly thought-out and arrestingly executed enigma. For me, the enigma is this How can a film be so great without also being that good?

Happening across a shooting party, Mexican lawman Bob Valdez is forced into a confrontation with an innocent army veteran, a black man accused by the rancher who's leading the party of a murder he didn't commit. Stricken with guilt at having killed the man, Valdez tries to get the rancher to give him $100 to compensate the dead man's Native American widow; however, he's met with contempt and physical violence, and the main part of the film sees him taking his revenge. (Although one should note that it's not straightforward revenge, as Valdez is acting as much to prove a point &#x96; to make the rancher accept his guilt and show some concern towards the oppressed &#x96; as he is to avenge a personal slight or injury.) Less downbeat and more unbelievable in its development than 'Hombre', this is nonetheless a film I wanted to like, and one which certainly has something to lift it above your average western. It's not a 'message' picture, as was the vogue at the time ('Little Big Man', 'Solider Blue' et al); rather, its revisionism is gentle and easy to miss, often just a seemingly throw-away line (asked when he hunted Apache, the titular hero replies before I know better). The fact that Valdez is a Mexican also runs counter to the usual western clichés of those 'over the border' being either caricatured bandidos (Calvera from 'The Magnificent Seven' and General Mapache from 'The Wild Bunch') or poor, oppressed farmers, essentially innocent but often incapable of defending themselves without the help of white mercenaries (again, we can turn to 'The Magnificent Seven' and 'The Wild Bunch' for examples). Indeed, an exchange between Valdez and his old friend Diego, where Valdez impersonates the rancher who will prove the villain of the piece, nicely captures the mix of scorn and idealisation which characterises the white man's view of the Mexican well, you're a good greaser, Diego. As long as you're a good greaser, I treat you fair and square &#x96; yes sirree, Diego, you people sure know how to live singing, dancing, screwing &#x96; you don't worry about nothing. It's one of the best moments of the film, in part because it's so understated, yet underlain with a certain dramatic tension having begun wryly, ironically, Lancaster delivers the final line with what is almost a sigh; a shift to a new, quiet seriousness and determination which is signalled by the faint rattle of Morricone-esquire percussion on the soundtrack, and which sees him ride out on his horse for his near-fatal second encounter with the rancher.Given all this, it's unfortunate that the Mexican is played by a white man in make-up, although I'd accept that, back in the 70s, there were less bankable Latin stars of the kind who crop up in Hollywood films today (one can imagine Benicio del Toro playing this role, for example). Not that Burt Lancaster's make-up is particularly bad; and, after all, the fact that he played the hero of Robert Aldrich's 'Apache' in similar 'brown-face' didn't prevent him from giving a very fine performance in a very fine film. His blue eyes do look a little out of place here though, and the henchman character, 'El Segundo', looks like a pantomime villain, with hair that sprouts in huge, wild tufts on either side of his head, and dollops of face-paint which make him look like Laurence Olivier's Othello. Indeed, several of the protagonists also look distinctly like 70s TV characters I'm thinking primarily of the woman Valdez kidnaps, and her man, the villain of the piece.Particularly in the second half of the film, 'Valdez is Coming' threatens to become a rather tedious revenge\/chase movie, though the plot is slightly more complex than this. Nonetheless, there is something rather pulpy about the way that Lancaster turns from put-upon minor lawman to brilliantly competent guerrilla fighter, shooting a man from a 1,000 yards, easily picking off the numerous armed riders sent after him, and sneaking into the heart of the enemy camp without anyone noticing. It's particularly noticeable partly because of the understated, resigned quality that characterises his performance in the initial stages of the film moving slowly and speaking carefully, almost deferentially, Valdez is a character not exactly resigned to his lot (which is being treated with open or concealed contempt by his white neighbours) but understandably cautious about being too outspoken. From the moment he pulls his old army gear from under the bed and starts to growl, Valdez is coming, he is suddenly athletic, hyper-alert, and a crack shot who never misses the target. Imposing such a cliché on what could have been a reasonably realistic look at life in the Old West means that the film fails to live up to its initial promise. The end result is a rather uneasy compromise between action-movie set-pieces and something more thoughtful and interesting. Still, it's worth an hour and a half of your time &#x96; even if that's for what it could have been more than for what it is.

From the moment he pulls his old army gear from under the bed and starts to growl, Valdez is coming, he is suddenly athletic, hyper-alert, and a crack shot who never misses the target. Imposing such a cliché on what could have been a reasonably realistic look at life in the Old West means that the film fails to live up to its initial promise. The end result is a rather uneasy compromise between action-movie set-pieces and something more thoughtful and interesting. Still, it's worth an hour and a half of your time &#x96; even if that's for what it could have been more than for what it is. ","genre":"Western"},{"date":"27 November 2009","score":"","review":" There's an immediacy to this film; there's something that makes Fritz Lang's 1931 film distinctly menacing throughout. Whether it's the distinct intimacy of certain scenes, which take place in enclosed spaces such as underground bars and locked storage rooms; the manipulation of light to create bizarre images and shapes as familiar and somewhat usually unspectacular places are rendered spaces of terror or, indeed, 'uncanny'; the idea that the most powerful 'groups' of characters are additionally the more unlikeable; or just the frank and sheer immediacy of the title, 'M', something in Lang's 1931 picture always seems to just toy with the audience. 'M' is a sublimely taught and somewhat creepy little film that basks in its breaking down of genre convention and thoroughly enjoys its swaying in and out of scenes, elements and subject matter that both thrill and horrify in equal measure.The film was made by a man on a seemingly insatiable run for making movies; some will argue he never made a better one than this. Lang's 1931 piece is so accomplished that watching it decades later, ticking off the influences and ideas spawned because of it borders on a little game within itself; from John Mackenzie's 1980 effort The Long Good Friday, to the much more contemporary and far more reliant on ambiguity and symbolism, Lady Vengeance; Lang's M knows no bounds in terms of levels of influence.The world in which M takes place is a frightening and confusing one; a world in which public hysteria and paranoia grips practically everyone. A world in which a police force are experimenting with new techniques in catching criminals and must venture into this investigation blind; a film in which criminals and organised gangs of criminals feel the need to step to the forefront, thus threatening to take on the role of the protagonists as we will them on in their goals, but it is a drive born out of loss of income that takes control within the minds of those that head the operations, thus placing their actions on a fine line between righteous and ignorant. But above all this, a world in which a child killing individual is made the focus of interest and the sole reason all the hate, confusion and anger is born.M starts in a manner that captures some of what its overall themes will observe. A group of young girls are about to commence a street-set game, and in order to select those first to take part, one member of the group uses a particularly blood thirsty rhyme to 'pick out' a random child. The scene echoes not only what it is the evil within the film indulges in, but highlights a certain juxtaposition that will be prominent later on; in the sense young and innocent girls sing about blood-shed and murder, while supposedly hardened and unlikeable criminals whom run underground bars, are on the hunt to capture a murderer. The notion of evil fighting evil is prominent and Lang plays with this notion when, in what is one of my favourite scenes from the film, the aforementioned killer is trapped in a room and the criminals are closing in &#x96; we have to remind ourselves of Lorre's character's past deeds to save wanting him to get out.The film does indeed revolve around Lorre's character; a certain Hans Beckert. The film has no shame in revealing who he is and precisely what he is very early on; this is less-so a detective story posing the question who's doing it? as much as it is a film asking how someone can go about being caught and stopped. A lot of the eeriness of Lorre's Beckert comes from the actor's 'patched up' look and expressive face; that child-like expression, that odd look he carries at the most relaxed of times, that worried and juxtaposed sense of excitement and fear that grips him when a net led by mobsters closes in. This is in great credit to the casting of Lorre, in relation to face and figure, and how he himself delivers a performance that gets across a sense of blood-lust, madness and dread at well spaced intervals.The sense of technique and progression in M in relation to capturing the killer acts as one of the film's more interesting diversions. Perhaps acting as a representation of modernity, the police force and their methods of apprehension are shot in stark contrast to how the lower-downs of society go about their business. In this sense, the criminals, who are in it purely out of loss of income, use the lowest of the low in street-dwelling beggars and the homeless to keep a look out for who might be the killer. This cross comparison of new methods, which prove unsuccessful, and 'old fashioned'grounded techniques that prove useful, is interesting. As a film that blurs lines between what is frightening and what it thrilling; who is good and who is evil, and how the clear-cut representation of 'good' in the police force is placed in the background for most a film of this ilk, M is a monstrous triumph. In regards to exploring German cinema from whatever era, be sure to include M as a film to see.

I remember seeing this film not long after it was first released and it staying in my mind for a long time afterwards - this most recent viewing will have the same effect even if time does show up some of its deficiencies.The film nods to Hitchcock's masterpiece Vertigo in many ways - Like James Stewart's Scotty Ferguson, Cliff Robertson here portrays a man so devastated by loss of a loved one that he goes to extremes to replace her with a living breathing substitute, expected to subsume her individuality and identity to his will. There are other Hitchcock motifs on board, like the utilisation of a prominent portrait of Robertson's wife and daughter, the insertion of an old church as a key location and of course, most obviously, Hitch's composer-in-residence Bernard Herrman's sweeping, almost suffocating orchestral score which seems to overlay nearly every scene. The famous Grace Kelly scissors scene from Dial M For Murder also gets a look-in when Robertson dispatches in self-defence his treacherous business partner-cum-friend John Lithgow.De Palma's work here is highly stylised, with the whole possessing a dream-like quality, with smooth tracking shots the norm, culminating in the final revolving shots of Robertson and his reunited daughter at the conclusion as Herrman's music swells ever louder. The plotting is very complicated however and at times hard to swallow. The inference of Robertson's unwitting incestuous attraction to his grown-up daughter by the end is down-played but still disturbs plus it seems unlikely that bad guy Lithgow would go to such extremes to wrest control of the company away from long-time partner Robertson, especially over such a long period of time. But hey, I'm pretty sure that the plot to Vertigo has more than a few loose ends and unbelievable devices and while De Palma's film can't claim to be the cinematic great that Vertigo was, we have to remember the difference in the experience, knowledge and okay, skill of the two directors at the respective helms. Maybe De Palma very often was the Oasis to the Beatles if I can bring in a musical analogy but that shouldn't deny De Palma his due. At the very least he made near Hitchcock-class thrillers well into the 80's when the Master had long passed onThe acting is solid by all the players, especially Robertson in the key role as the grieving, driven widower unable to move on with his life until he has atoned for his earlier error in judgement. Perhaps John Lithgow is just a little too much cartoonish as the Southern gentleman baddie - he could almost be the template for JR Ewing from Dallas, even down to the clothes.This particular film was made only a few years after another haunting thriller of death loss and memory set in Italy, Nic Roeg's superior Don't Look Now with both films, like the best (or worst) of dreams, staying with you long after you've woken up.

I think many could make the argument that Planes, Trains & Automobiles is his best work. He wrote a lot of scripts, even into the years before his death, but as far as the ones he directed, you won't get one that resonates on an adult level quite like this. The Breakfast Club will always hold a special, nostalgic place in my heart, but, looking at his filmography, this 1987 entry is the one that doesn't deal with teenage angst. Not even speaking about the swearing&#x97;we are talking hard-R for one rental car rant alone&#x97;the subject matter is more buddy comedy dealing with serious heartache on the holidays than high school cliques and growing up. The consummate Thanksgiving film? &#x85; I'd say so. One of the best comedies ever made? &#x85; I think one could argue that statement as well.It is weird how many comedies of this kind deal with a marketing\/creative executive&#x97;the underrated Nothing to Lose comes to mind&#x97;but we open with Steve Martin's Neal Page watching his boss hem and haw about an advertisement, desperately needing to catch a plane home to his family in Chicago. The film quickly becomes a race against time to make it to the airport before 600, soon finding one man as a large adversary to this goal&#x97;John Candy's great Del Griffith. This character is the epitome of what made Candy such a great comedic talent. His jolly appeal sucks you right in, making you feel for him despite his obnoxious talent at talking unceasingly. He wears his emotions on his sleeve, smiling wide when he is happy and pouting darkly when being chastised for being himself. For anyone that wonders whether they need to change who they are to keep relationships should take a good look at most of Candy's roles, but especially this one, to see that all it takes is self-confidence and a love for yourself to succeed. If someone doesn't like you for who you are, well then they aren't worthy of knowing you anyways.These two men find their lives to be intertwined for the next couple days, trying every way possible to get home. Between flight delays; inclement weather; a smoking and immobile train; a combustible rental car; awkward evenings in motel rooms; and just being two of the most opposite personalities to be put together in close quarters, the laughs are big and many. There are so many oneliners to be remembered and repeated&#x97;just ask my cousin who was quoting the film the entire day before we watched it&#x97;showing the talent that was Hughes. His ability to write how people speak was unequaled. He characters were real and very much based on people that we all have in our lives. Everyone has, or is, a stoic, serious, and cold Neal Page or an overbearing, kindhearted, loudmouth Del Griffith. No matter which they are, there is always something that makes them irreplaceable in your life; no matter their shortcomings, they are trustworthy, compassionate, and will risk their own lives for yours.Planes, Trains & Automobiles is full of set pieces and physical comedy too, but you cannot deny the writing and how it weaves all the parts to make a cohesive whole. This odd couple could make any situation gold, so pitting them against each other in heightened circumstances, let alone so many in such a short time, will allow them to excel. Tragedy upon tragedy can easily become too much, be seen as contrived plot devices that are utilized to advance the story artificially rather than a natural sequence of events. For some reason, though, and I think it goes back to Hughes, it completely works here. The transitions are seamless and instead of dreading the I wonder what will happen next question, you begin to anticipate the next unfortunate mishap, relishing the comedic genius that will follow. Both Martin and Candy are at the top of their games here, honing the elastic zaniness that made them so effective in earlier years to complement the seasoned professionalism that their careers had taken on. Martin, of course, has continued to evolve and succeed even now, more than two decades later, so we can only imagine the great unforgettable roles we've missed since Candy passed away in 1994.Again, though, no matter how important these leads are to the film, Hughes is the wizard behind the curtain. All the things he is known for, the final freeze frame, the schmaltzy music cues, (which somehow work effectively every time), and the reality of how humorous heartache can be are included. They are little trademarks, proving the auteur Hughes was, and make you wonder how different some of his scripted works would have been if he was behind the camera on them. There is also something to be said about his supporting characters&#x97;well written and integral despite the lack of screen time they are given. Someone like Kevin Bacon makes his villainous part three-dimensional while having no lines, emoting strictly from body language; Dylan Baker embodies backwoods hick like no other; and Hughes regular Edie McClurg takes the f-bomb laced rant from Martin like a champ, adding the perfect footnote to the sequence. And I think this is why his films are so cherished and unforgettable; they do all the little things right, making them masterpieces whether you feel their subject matter deserves the praise or not.

I think many could make the argument that Planes, Trains & Automobiles is his best work. He wrote a lot of scripts, even into the years before his death, but as far as the ones he directed, you won't get one that resonates on an adult level quite like this. The Breakfast Club will always hold a special, nostalgic place in my heart, but, looking at his filmography, this 1987 entry is the one that doesn't deal with teenage angst. Not even speaking about the swearing&#x97;we are talking hard-R for one rental car rant alone&#x97;the subject matter is more buddy comedy dealing with serious heartache on the holidays than high school cliques and growing up. The consummate Thanksgiving film? &#x85; I'd say so. One of the best comedies ever made? &#x85; I think one could argue that statement as well.It is weird how many comedies of this kind deal with a marketing\/creative executive&#x97;the underrated Nothing to Lose comes to mind&#x97;but we open with Steve Martin's Neal Page watching his boss hem and haw about an advertisement, desperately needing to catch a plane home to his family in Chicago. The film quickly becomes a race against time to make it to the airport before 600, soon finding one man as a large adversary to this goal&#x97;John Candy's great Del Griffith. This character is the epitome of what made Candy such a great comedic talent. His jolly appeal sucks you right in, making you feel for him despite his obnoxious talent at talking unceasingly. He wears his emotions on his sleeve, smiling wide when he is happy and pouting darkly when being chastised for being himself. For anyone that wonders whether they need to change who they are to keep relationships should take a good look at most of Candy's roles, but especially this one, to see that all it takes is self-confidence and a love for yourself to succeed. If someone doesn't like you for who you are, well then they aren't worthy of knowing you anyways.These two men find their lives to be intertwined for the next couple days, trying every way possible to get home. Between flight delays; inclement weather; a smoking and immobile train; a combustible rental car; awkward evenings in motel rooms; and just being two of the most opposite personalities to be put together in close quarters, the laughs are big and many. There are so many oneliners to be remembered and repeated&#x97;just ask my cousin who was quoting the film the entire day before we watched it&#x97;showing the talent that was Hughes. His ability to write how people speak was unequaled. He characters were real and very much based on people that we all have in our lives. Everyone has, or is, a stoic, serious, and cold Neal Page or an overbearing, kindhearted, loudmouth Del Griffith. No matter which they are, there is always something that makes them irreplaceable in your life; no matter their shortcomings, they are trustworthy, compassionate, and will risk their own lives for yours.Planes, Trains & Automobiles is full of set pieces and physical comedy too, but you cannot deny the writing and how it weaves all the parts to make a cohesive whole. This odd couple could make any situation gold, so pitting them against each other in heightened circumstances, let alone so many in such a short time, will allow them to excel. Tragedy upon tragedy can easily become too much, be seen as contrived plot devices that are utilized to advance the story artificially rather than a natural sequence of events. For some reason, though, and I think it goes back to Hughes, it completely works here. The transitions are seamless and instead of dreading the I wonder what will happen next question, you begin to anticipate the next unfortunate mishap, relishing the comedic genius that will follow. Both Martin and Candy are at the top of their games here, honing the elastic zaniness that made them so effective in earlier years to complement the seasoned professionalism that their careers had taken on. Martin, of course, has continued to evolve and succeed even now, more than two decades later, so we can only imagine the great unforgettable roles we've missed since Candy passed away in 1994.Again, though, no matter how important these leads are to the film, Hughes is the wizard behind the curtain. All the things he is known for, the final freeze frame, the schmaltzy music cues, (which somehow work effectively every time), and the reality of how humorous heartache can be are included. They are little trademarks, proving the auteur Hughes was, and make you wonder how different some of his scripted works would have been if he was behind the camera on them. There is also something to be said about his supporting characters&#x97;well written and integral despite the lack of screen time they are given. Someone like Kevin Bacon makes his villainous part three-dimensional while having no lines, emoting strictly from body language; Dylan Baker embodies backwoods hick like no other; and Hughes regular Edie McClurg takes the f-bomb laced rant from Martin like a champ, adding the perfect footnote to the sequence. And I think this is why his films are so cherished and unforgettable; they do all the little things right, making them masterpieces whether you feel their subject matter deserves the praise or not. They have all stood the test of time and will continue to do so for years to come, extending his legacy and securing his place in cinematic history.

However, he is imprisoned by the conspirators and Jill goes to the theater to avoid the crime. The Man Who Knew Too Much is one of the early Alfred Hitchcock's movies and very irregular in its execution.

Unfortunately, there are also some dull moments, like the scenes with the annoying Betty; or the silly fight in the church; or the lack of credit to Clive's explanation to the policemen; or why Abbot did not kill Bob and Betty.
