I watched it and I found it indeed is. It's a very well cast, written and directed film by John Ford. The movie is about a family from Oklahoma migrated to California to find work during the great depression. I don't know why we call it 'Great' depression rather than calling it 'worst' depression or 'Devil' depression. I think humans are romantic about misery and so all the brutes or incident which brought misery are called 'Great' like Alexander the devil, Napoleon the devil and Devil Depression of America (1929). I'm sure by the next century Hitler will also be termed as 'Great' as by then probably western anti-communist agenda would have subsided and people will find greatness in Hitler's policies. Anyways. Henry Fonda- a Criminal by circumstances comes back from jail on parole to his home during American economic depression only to find his land is grabbed by capitalism and his family has moved to his uncle's farm. He meets them there and as his uncle's farm is also doomed they have no choice but to move towards the west to find work. In rest of the film the whole family keeps moving from one place to the other looking for work. The film has some very moving scenes especially the one where family stops at a restaurant to buy bread. The closeness of the family members, their relationship with each other is shown beautifully. At one point I was really compelled to think they are better off as at least they are together but from the next scene onwards the family starts breaking into pieces. Staying away from the family members is a curse of capitalism and this movie has depicted it in a very formal way. People are just lost on the way. Husband leaves his wife for a job. Uncle takes a dive into the water and asks others to move on as he wants to live close to a river. How things become direction less in a money oriented society is very well done here. Jane Darwell as Ma Joad steals the show. Henry Fonda has never said a word differently in any of his film so no point in discussing what he does here.This is not a movie where you look for a story. Each and every scene is an anecdote for the people who have seen or have gone through the similar misery. It is a lesson for the future generation that the international conflict of 1914-1919 and 1939-1945 are no separate incidents. American, British and French postwar policies created global depression which resulted in unemployment and bringing communists in to power in Italy and Germany. The Great depression was a result of the First World War and a reason for the Second World War.I must admit that when characters in the film picked up the mud and called it 'my land' I did not confuse it with 'the land we confiscated from Red Indians'. I'm sure Americans found the whole 'my land' thing very moving but I have read history carefully and could not forget that the same thing happened just a hundred years back and persecuted was a persecutor then. This movie came out in 1940-the Second World War had already started by then. America was still in shambles as Great FDR of Great America had still not looted Great Churchill of Great Britain in the name of help and became a Great American President. It seems movie won two well deserved Oscars for the director and best supporting actress. This movie was a big hit and Henry Fonda became a superstar overnight. The legend goes he reluctantly signed a seven years contract with universal just because of this movie. A must watch.

Condensing the gigantic W. Somerset Maugham novel down to a movie that clocks in at under an hour and a half seemed like a disaster waiting to happen. But you know, the movie's not half bad, and it even manages to retain much of what makes the book resonate so much with its readers.I've heard many film buffs complain that Leslie Howard was a wet noodle of an actor, and he was, but I can't think of anyone more suited to play the role of Philip Carey than a wet noodle, for that's certainly what Carey is. Howard plays him well, which means you want to shake him and slap him upside the head repeatedly, then finally take him out and buy him a spine.Ah, and then there's Bette, as the girl with whom Carey is obsessed and who brings his world crashing down around him. I didn't know what on earth the appeal of Mildred was in the book, and the movie stays true to that detail. But as played by Davis, she does become the most fascinating character in the story, and if she's nasty and unlikable, she's at least the most dynamic person on screen at any given time. Davis's performance here is credited with changing the course of screen acting, much as Brando's would do nearly 20 years later when he screamed out Stella!! in that little-known Tennesee Williams play, and it's not hard to see why. Davis is intense to the point of scary. She makes no effort to wring any sympathy from the audience, and she allows herself to look ugly and most unglamorous. Her appearance when Carey walks in on her late in the film to find her dead or nearly dead of an unnamed disease (though not much care is taken to hide the fact that it's an STD) is shocking. Of course, it helps that this movie squeaked out just before the Production Code went into effect; if it had been made a year later, you can bet things would have been a bit different.Yes, much of the novel, and many of its most interesting parts, are left on the cutting room floor, and the story really does become about Carey and Mildred and not much else. I found that to be the least interesting and most tedious part of Maugham's novel, but it is the part that gives the novel its title and seems to be the part that readers are still drawn to now, so it strikes me as a wise decision on the part of the film makers that they chose to adapt the novel the way they did.Grade B+ ","genre":null},{"date":"28 December 2005","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" When I saw that this film was only 80 minutes long, I thought we were in trouble.

I found that to be the least interesting and most tedious part of Maugham's novel, but it is the part that gives the novel its title and seems to be the part that readers are still drawn to now, so it strikes me as a wise decision on the part of the film makers that they chose to adapt the novel the way they did.Grade B+ ","genre":"Drama, Romance"},{"date":"28 December 2005","score":"73 out of 130 people found the following review useful","review":" !!!!!

The Survivors is a muddled mess with script problems and, most curiously, problems with the casting of its leading actors Matthau and Robin Williams. Just reading that would make you thing that the casting is inspired but it ends up working against the film. Matthau and Williams have two very distinctive styles of comedy that work against each other and that aspect is clear throughout the movie. These two appear to be starring in different movies even when they are on screen together. Director Michael Ritchie appears to have let Williams and his manic sense of humor go crazy with no attempt to reel him in to a calmer level more suitable for the film. Take a look at The World According to Garp where Williams worked with the great George Roy Hill to see a restrained and terrific performance.

This movie will have you rolling in your seat with laughter. Seriously, it has elements of The Three Stooges and balletic Keaton-like stunt-work so that in essence, Drunken Master is the perfect action-comedy.Directed by Yuen Wo Ping, who would later become well-known to American audiences for his work on the Matrix films and the Kill Bill flicks, Chan stars as an undisciplined troublemaker who happens to be an expert martial artist. When his father disowns him following an incident with a close relative, Chan goes and finds apprenticeship with a drunkard hermit, who teaches him the ancient kung-fu fighting style of drunken boxing.For those that don't know, drunken boxing (a.k.a. drunken fist or drunken master), as the title would imply, is a martial arts style that utilizes the staggering, unfocused movements of the typical drunkard. Chan exercises the movements gracefully in one training sequence, and it's one of the most effective fighting techniques though one may need to have an incredibly flexible body to master it. Because of the apparently unfocused posture of the fighter, his movements are concealed from the opponent, making it nearly impossible to anticipate his strikes. (To be able to use the style though, I'm not sure if one needs to be genuinely intoxicated to master its movements.)Chan eventually masters the techniques taught to him, and then uses his newfound skills to battle a lethal assassin who has since arrived to collect a price on his father's head.I don't know what it is exactly that made me enjoy this picture so much. The character Chan plays has been the object of Chinese folklore for nearly two centuries, but he would later find more serious film characteristics in the Once Upon a Time in China movies with Jet Li. Drunken Master shows why Chan is the star he is today.

Just about every one of his films is thrilling and dramatic. I know that I am treating him the way some fans do to Tarintino or Burton, but I just plain love his films! I just finished Rear Window. It blew me away. Instead of just simply saying This film rocks, I will describe in detail the greatness and superiority of this film.Like most Hitchcock films, Rear Window stars James Stewart. He plays L.B. Jefferies, a photographer for a magazine who recently broke his leg when trying to take a photo in the middle of a racetrack. (His boss said he wanted something new and exciting.) So, L.B. Jefferies has absolutely nothing better to do than just sit down in his wheelchair and watch the neighbors do their daily business. But, one night, he hears fighting, bickering, and then a scream from one of his neighbors apartments. Then, he observes as the man living in the apartment enters and exits his house three times during the rain. Now, isn't that odd? What could it be? Murder! Rear Window is a very complex and one hell of a movie. The drama, thrills and comedy do not under whelm the viewer.Rear Window is successful as a thriller. Wouldn't it be weird to wonder what your neighbor was doing from at least seven feet away? L.B. Jefferies sees him doing mysterious actions, but doesn't know exactly what he is doing or thinking. Plus, he has to make sure that the neighbor doesn't see him! Rear Window is surrounded by a creepy atmosphere and scares and bewilders the viewer, whenever the neighbor does something. What is he doing? Can he really be murdering his neighbor? Where is he? As the plot grows more and more complex, the viewer can only hold their breath until the action happens. The film is also effective, considering the distance between L.B. Jefferies and his neighbor. It gives the viewer an increased feeling of uncertainty, and makes the film even more seemingly complex and vague.Drama occurs between the characters, as they each play to their own tricks. L.B. Jefferies and the audience aren't the only ones being creeped out. How unforgettable is the scene where Lisa slips a note under his door saying What have you done with her? Even with that, Rear Window can be a comedy. It doesn't make much of an effort for it's jokes, and cleverly hides them amongst dialogue.Lisa I wish I was creative like that.L.B. Jefferies You are. You're great at creating difficult situations.Yep. Rear Window is just about perfect. But, Hitchcock fans expecting an unpredictable twister of a movie will be disappointed, because there are no major twists. Then again, a major Hitchcock fan wouldn't expect that, would they? Besides, I can't tell you how many thrillers ended up confusing due to plot twists.10\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"28 December 2005","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Hitchcock has always been a genius.

What is he doing? Can he really be murdering his neighbor? Where is he? As the plot grows more and more complex, the viewer can only hold their breath until the action happens. The film is also effective, considering the distance between L.B. Jefferies and his neighbor. It gives the viewer an increased feeling of uncertainty, and makes the film even more seemingly complex and vague.Drama occurs between the characters, as they each play to their own tricks. L.B. Jefferies and the audience aren't the only ones being creeped out. How unforgettable is the scene where Lisa slips a note under his door saying What have you done with her? Even with that, Rear Window can be a comedy. It doesn't make much of an effort for it's jokes, and cleverly hides them amongst dialogue.Lisa I wish I was creative like that.L.B. Jefferies You are. You're great at creating difficult situations.Yep. Rear Window is just about perfect. But, Hitchcock fans expecting an unpredictable twister of a movie will be disappointed, because there are no major twists. Then again, a major Hitchcock fan wouldn't expect that, would they? Besides, I can't tell you how many thrillers ended up confusing due to plot twists.10\/10 ","genre":"Mystery, Thriller"},{"date":"28 December 2005","score":"1 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" I watched this film thinking that it was the half-cooked horror flick of the same name about a serial killing snowman(yeah, I know, but it's one of those films where you just *have* to see it, just to find out if it's really as bad as it sounds).

It's a very special movie, and not necessarily for the only reason that some remember the film mostly for. Of course, Marlene Dietrich, in her debut, is stunningly sexy, in clothing in some scenes (and the legs of course) that must've caused some turned eyebrows on its first release. But despite her great charisma, and a certain feminine attitude that was unique for the time, there is really another big factor that makes the Blue Angel work a lot more for me than I thought. Hearing about the film, I got the impression it might be more of a vehicle for Dietrich, the inspiration for what would come in Madeline Kahn's equally memorable turn in Blazing Saddles. What I didn't expect was such a well-rounded, bittersweet kind of story going along, not to mention a sublime, powerful lead performance.It's really the story of Professor Rath, played without a cue missed (and with some of his own ingenuity) by Emil Jannings. Here is a teacher with high morals, and little tolerance for his College student's impudence. He finds out from a classmate interrogation that some of the kids are sneaking off to 'the Blue Angel', a club with dancers, music, and singing in half-naked costumes. He meets Lola (Dietrich) and against all his better judgment, he falls in head over heels, loses his job, and then...well, it might be best to leave it there. What then ensues is a sort of collision of an enriching structure from director Josef von Sternberg (in that the unexpected occurs at times, if only in the little behaviors and bits of business with the characters), and Janning's acting.I loved how it sort of went past the barriers that might have stifled other filmmakers at the turn of the start of silent to sound- the musical numbers makes the Blue Angel club seem hypnotic, sensual, and a little crazy. Then the use of the camera, its stillness most times, focusing on the subtleties of the acting, bring forward the remnants of the finely-tuned theatrical acting from the silent era. What Jannings does here is make a character with a total arc, in this sort of downward spiral that soon occurs once he's made his decision in terms of how he feels vs his career. The last twenty minutes or so, when it finally comes back around for the teacher a 180- from respected teacher to, well, you'll see- is rather shocking, and not as light and amusing as during the first forty minutes or so. But it also shows that Jannings, more often than not, is fearless in his timing and expressions. It's not a completely realistic performance here and there, but it sometimes doesn't need to be. Sternberg sets up such a mood that persists, with little touches (i.e. shots of the statues moving as the clock chimes, expressionistic angles), that give Janning's enough room to do what he does. He helps make the character, who at first seems very expectable and usual (a cranky teacher) into someone we care about. Of course, one doesn't discount Dietrich's presence in the film as enough to seek out the film. She doesn't necessarily give a great acting turn, but in terms of just a great screen presence at times, of providing enough airs to make it clear why Janning's character is falling for her like this. That there are good supporting actors all around them is a plus as well. It's one of those rare films you might smile one minute and then get a little sad at the next.

With great difficulty he arranges for a bicycle which gets stolen on the very first day at work. Antonio knows he can't find it but still he has no choice so he sets out with his son to look for his bicycle. Audiences along with father and son contemplate every aspect of bicycle i.e. number plates, careers, pedals etc while searching for it. The desperation of the protagonist is heart-breaking.I was avoiding this flick because a friend of mine told me an Indian classic called 'Do Beega Zameen' is loosely based on 'Bicycle thief'. I love this Indian flick but I didn't want to see any thing in the same line. After a long time I happened to see 'Bicycle thief' and realized that this movie is just incomparable.

It's a very powerful scene if you have equated hunger, food and money ever in your life. The film is so real that you forget that its film. The last few scenes gets you totally.

With his array of sophisticated technology he causes Earthquakes, typhoons, hot hail & sends the moon out of it's orbit & speeding towards Earth. The plane New York Jets quarterback Flash Gordon (Sam J. Jones) & estate agent Dale Arden (Melody Anderson) are flying in crash lands in the laboratory of ex Nasa space scientist Dr. Hans Zarkow (Topol) who, at gunpoint, forces Flash & Dale into a homemade spaceship which he intends to use to fly to a planet called Mongo & save Earth. Dr. Zarkow explains that he has, for years, anticipated an alien attack on Earth & has been preparing for just such an occasion. Once on Mongo they are taken prisoner by Ming & Klytus (Peter Wyngarde) head of the secret police & sentenced to death by public execution. Helped by Ming's daughter Princess Aura (Ornella Muti) Flash decides he must find a way to escape, defeat Ming & save Earth before it's too late!This English production was directed by Mike Hodges & is very camp, silly & hard not to laugh at but at the same time provides buckets of entertainment. The script by Lorenzo Semple Jr., based on the comic strip by Alex Raymond, is hilariously bad. Some of the dialogue in this thing is priceless, it really is. The character's have all the subtly & depth of a pantomime, they are about as clichéd as you can get as well, the evil Emporer, the hero who brings everyone together & saves the day, the attractive dim female who falls for the hero, the evil character who turns good in the end, the Prince, the rebellion & a whole other host of sci-fi clichés. The story itself is just ridiculous, those wedding vows at the end are funny while despite being ruler of the entire Universe Ming & the people of Mongo decide to pinch our 'here comes the bride' wedding march music & it's convenient that everyone helpfully speaks English. The ending is made me cringe as lifelong enemies suddenly become best buddies & the Hawkmen spell out the words 'Thanks' & 'Flash' in the sky! Everything about Flash Gordon is just so campy, embarrassing to watch & badly thought out but I still had great times with it. The best way to describe Flash Gordon is as entertaining crap.Hodges was apparently the eighth director chosen, which wouldn't exactly fill me with confidence in that there were seven director's ahead of me on a list all of whom declined. The film is an amazing visual spectacle throughout, the garish art-deco inspired production design, costumes & props by the Italian Danilo Donati are the real star of Flash Gordon. The extravagant sets & production design to the multi coloured costumes & I don't know why but I kept thinking that Ming's rocket-ships looked like a penis with wings! There is little in the way of actual excitement, the action & fight scenes are a bit uninspired.With a budget of about $35,000,000 Flash Gordon was a well funded film so it comes as a surprise that the special effects are so rotten, the blue screen stuff & the flying Hawkmen in particular look awful, they hardly flap their wings & some not at all. I mean do you know how much they would have to flap them to even get off the ground?! Personally I hated the music by Queen & especially the Flash Gordon song but someone out there may like it. The campy Brian Blessed as Vultan is an absolute hoot to watch, Timothy Dalton as Barin seems to be taking things too seriously, Jones is awful as Gordon, Sydow as Ming overacts with the best of them while a special mention goes to Mariangela Melato as the evil General Kala whom I though was a bit of a babe until she melted into a puddle of goo.Flash Gordon is not a film I can recommend if your looking for some exciting, serious sci-fi action. Flash Gordon is a film I can recommend if your looking for campy, big budget fun with some of the funniest dialogue in a sci-fi film ever. Mind numbingly bad but at the same time wonderfully entertaining, you decide which one is more important.

Jones) & estate agent Dale Arden (Melody Anderson) are flying in crash lands in the laboratory of ex Nasa space scientist Dr. Hans Zarkow (Topol) who, at gunpoint, forces Flash & Dale into a homemade spaceship which he intends to use to fly to a planet called Mongo & save Earth. Dr. Zarkow explains that he has, for years, anticipated an alien attack on Earth & has been preparing for just such an occasion. Once on Mongo they are taken prisoner by Ming & Klytus (Peter Wyngarde) head of the secret police & sentenced to death by public execution. Helped by Ming's daughter Princess Aura (Ornella Muti) Flash decides he must find a way to escape, defeat Ming & save Earth before it's too late!This English production was directed by Mike Hodges & is very camp, silly & hard not to laugh at but at the same time provides buckets of entertainment. The script by Lorenzo Semple Jr., based on the comic strip by Alex Raymond, is hilariously bad. Some of the dialogue in this thing is priceless, it really is. The character's have all the subtly & depth of a pantomime, they are about as clichéd as you can get as well, the evil Emporer, the hero who brings everyone together & saves the day, the attractive dim female who falls for the hero, the evil character who turns good in the end, the Prince, the rebellion & a whole other host of sci-fi clichés. The story itself is just ridiculous, those wedding vows at the end are funny while despite being ruler of the entire Universe Ming & the people of Mongo decide to pinch our 'here comes the bride' wedding march music & it's convenient that everyone helpfully speaks English. The ending is made me cringe as lifelong enemies suddenly become best buddies & the Hawkmen spell out the words 'Thanks' & 'Flash' in the sky! Everything about Flash Gordon is just so campy, embarrassing to watch & badly thought out but I still had great times with it. The best way to describe Flash Gordon is as entertaining crap.Hodges was apparently the eighth director chosen, which wouldn't exactly fill me with confidence in that there were seven director's ahead of me on a list all of whom declined. The film is an amazing visual spectacle throughout, the garish art-deco inspired production design, costumes & props by the Italian Danilo Donati are the real star of Flash Gordon. The extravagant sets & production design to the multi coloured costumes & I don't know why but I kept thinking that Ming's rocket-ships looked like a penis with wings! There is little in the way of actual excitement, the action & fight scenes are a bit uninspired.With a budget of about $35,000,000 Flash Gordon was a well funded film so it comes as a surprise that the special effects are so rotten, the blue screen stuff & the flying Hawkmen in particular look awful, they hardly flap their wings & some not at all. I mean do you know how much they would have to flap them to even get off the ground?! Personally I hated the music by Queen & especially the Flash Gordon song but someone out there may like it. The campy Brian Blessed as Vultan is an absolute hoot to watch, Timothy Dalton as Barin seems to be taking things too seriously, Jones is awful as Gordon, Sydow as Ming overacts with the best of them while a special mention goes to Mariangela Melato as the evil General Kala whom I though was a bit of a babe until she melted into a puddle of goo.Flash Gordon is not a film I can recommend if your looking for some exciting, serious sci-fi action. Flash Gordon is a film I can recommend if your looking for campy, big budget fun with some of the funniest dialogue in a sci-fi film ever. Mind numbingly bad but at the same time wonderfully entertaining, you decide which one is more important.

It's about a group of German soldiers led by Michael Caine and aided by Donald Southerland as an Irishman, who parachute into England in an attempt to kidnap Winston Churchill and bring an end to the war. They fail, which can't be too big a surprise.The movie's plot is all over the place. Caine and his men are disguised as British paratroopers and they more or less take over a small British village, claiming to be on an exercise. But they wear their German uniforms under their fake British uniforms, and one of the men while saving the life of a young girl, dies and has his true identity revealed. This happens rather early in the movie, so the whole disguise business lasts only about 15 minutes. After that, the movie becomes routine. The Germans strip to field gray and hole up in a church. They are surrounded and outnumbered by American rangers and fight to the death, although it's not clear why they just don't surrender. The war is nearly over.What lifts the movie a bit above the expectable -- and this may be completely accidental -- is that it's not easy for the average viewer, used to watching less complicated material like Funniest Home Videos, to figure out which side to root for.The Germans of course have been fighting for an evil cause. Yet, in this instance at least, they are men of probity and honor. Their goal is not to assassinate Churchill (if that can be avoided) but to put the snatch on him and try to negotiate a settlement with the Allies. And you can tell the people who made the movie did not want a horde of hairy Huns playing goose-stepping Nazi types because the soldiers look like young men. One of them seems to be still in his teens and plays Bach on the church organ.And the U. S. Army that we see is led by a Colonel who is, as far as it's possible to tell, a complete idiot. The actor, Larry Hagman, hams it up outrageously, but it doesn't come across as comic, just stupid. His Colonel is so puffed up with ego, so angry at not having been allowed to see combat, that he chews out subordinates all the time and struts around with tiny mincing steps. When a woman finally puts a bullet through his head and he looks a little indignant -- well, it almost funny but not quite.Donald Southerland is a stage Irishman of a type we've seen before -- all charm and rosy cheeks. He laughs gaily at the prospect of putting his life in danger. He's romantic, falls in love with the wrong girl, likes a drop now and then, and is always ready for a fist fight.At the end, Caine finds himself in a position to shoot and kill Churchill. His face turns grim. He approaches the PM who stares at him with horror, and he deliberately shoots the guy. (Who turns out to be a mere stand-in for the real Churchill.) I don't know why he did that. It's not really in keeping with what we've seen of Caine's character so far. He's a proud man but not a cold-blooded murderer. I suspect the scene is in there to give the audience a momentary frisson -- WHAT? Churchill DEAD? It's pretty corny but then there are other banal scenes throughout the movie. The true identity of the Germans is revealed only through the hoary device of having one of the soldiers save an enemy's daughter from drowning and giving his own life in the process.The script is poor and the direction ordinary but the performances are competent enough, given what the actors have to work with. Jenny Agutter's nose turns up like a ski jump, like the inverted clipper bow of a Japanese battleship, like the trajectory of a freshly launched shuttle from Cape Canaveral. Any normal man would want to kiss it and bite it a little. Judy Geason looks just fine too. It wasn't nice of the writers to have her shot, but at least she survives.
