[{"date":"26 August 2015","score":"","review":" Surprisingly light on substance.A Kenneth Branagh written-and-directed adaptation of the Shakespeare play. Set in WW2 for the movie, The King of Navarre and his three best friends have sworn off wine, women and song for three years, in the interests of studying. But then the beautiful princess of France, and her equally-lovely ladies-in-waiting arrive, and their oaths are quickly and sorely tested...Fun and funny at times but ultimately quite empty. It is short to begin with - about 85 minutes. Then you have the fact that this version is a musical and the amount of actual movie time is even shorter. In the end it just seems so full of empty schmaltz, fluff and padding. Reasonably moving ending though.On the subject of the music, I generally dislike musicals but the choice of music here is pretty good George Gershwin, Cole Porter, Kern and Hammerstein, Irving Berlin. While I would still have preferred no musical numbers - it just wrecks any plausibility and continuity - it could have been a lot worse.Decent cast - Branagh, Alicia Silverstone, Alessandro Nivola, Natascha McElhone, Emily Mortimer, Nathan Lane, Timothy Spall - who put in solid performances. Don't know what Matthew Lillard is doing there though (note that I didn't include him in the decent cast list). He is conspicuous by his lack of acting skills and should stick to C-grade frat farces.

This time Dan's suckered in again, by his bad influence of a partner (Combs, again relishing in the role he was born to play, and doesn't slack in his performance) to create a living bride out of body parts. Cain, poses an interesting and candid question of painful reality to West, Is this why we became doctors?. You might of kind of find yourself losing grips with the plot, not the clearest. Eye candy honey, Kathleen Kinmont is one patient that passes, early in the pic, so add the dots to what happens when she does, and she's not the first. There are too much happenings on, where we are clouded to the following of story, but we have some new faces, like a pushy and over curious cop, and a young nutty morgue attendant. There are surprisingly good performances by all and Combs again delivers some killer lines, brilliantly, where his head nemeses from the original is still very much alive, in part. This is actually more gorier than the original, but the violence here isn't graphic or intense, as in that first one, where the movie came with a cautioned warning for those with not the strongest of stomachs. You might think I have it in for the Re animator movies. I just think here plot wise, the story falls wearied, where in the original, there wasn't enough plot to carry the movie off, even though the crazed and nightmarish situations made the original fun. Though if you're a Re Animator fan, you'll like this one, of course like a lot of other people I gather, I'd rather opt for the first. Followed by another sequel, if you're interested. I bet you Re Animator fans are.

Arming himself with an assortment of weapons, Eastland decides to become a vigilante in order to confiscate any money from criminals & writes a letter to a news station under the name The Exterminator. As his activities become more pronounced & violent, the police & an agent from the CIA (who is convinced that Eastland could be a foreign agent) join forces to hunt him down.In the late 1970s & early 1980s, genre cinema was becoming a major player in the controversy stakes by featuring ultra-violent tales of exploitation (mainly from the Italians with their uber-gory zombie & cannibal films) that made cult names of makeup & visual effects artists like Tom Savini. The Exterminator, a cult thriller from 1980, was banned in many countries & heavily cut in others due to its gore quotient, which was pushing boundaries at the time. It also made the name of actor Robert Ginty, who was turned into a minor B-grade action hero with this & its sequel Exterminator 2 & the sci-fi actioner PROGRAMMED TO KILL about a female cyborg assassin.The Exterminator was a minor player in the gore cinema of the time but was mainly a pedestrian cardboard thriller with some notorious scenes of gore that made its name & gave it a cult reputation. Watching this film a good thirty-five years after its release, I wasn't particularly impressed with the film's story & visuals &#x96; it only gained a cult name due to its gore which was somewhat disappointingly tame even at the time's standards. The best the film has to offer is a surprisingly nasty & realistic decapitation during the Vietnam War scene (The Exterminator was one of the very first films to depict the Vietnam War & the psychological effects it had on the people fighting in it), which was achieved with an animatronic head & the scene where Robert Ginty feeds a mafia head into an industrial meat grinder (which is more impactful by implication than actual depiction). There are also scenes where Ginty shoots a paedophile politician in the groin with mercury-laced exploding bullets & ties a pimp to a mattress & sets him on fire.Aside from the gore, The Exterminator is surprisingly pedestrian & slow going. Ginty fails to show any of the burning revenge that his character is supposed to have. What's more is that he only goes on his killing spree because he wants to prove himself by killing criminals in order to avenge his own failure to prevent his own capture during Vietnam & being mugged in the beer shed. The biggest problem is also in the ending, which builds itself up into becoming a climactic shootout but drops it suddenly & abruptly with Christopher George's cop & Ginty's hero being sniped at by a CIA sniper, Ginty surviving because of his flak vest.
