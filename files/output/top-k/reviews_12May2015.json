[{"date":"12 May 2015","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" October Sky (1999) Dir Joe Johnston \/ Cast Jake Gyllenhaal, Chris Cooper, Laura Dern, Chris Owen, William Lee Scott True story about the freedom to dream and avoid tradition. Jake Gyllenhaal dreams of going to space and builds miniature rockets. After he and his friends wreck his mother's white picket fence, he turns to the unpopular book worm for help. The rest consists of rocket launching tests to enter the science fair. Filled with stereotypes including the unpopular class nerd, the supportive ill health teacher, the hard nose principal, the popular girl, and Chris Cooper with the dreary role of discouraging father. Director Joe Johnston establishes the 1957 setting with fantastic rocket launching footage but unfortunately he launches a screenplay full of clichés and stereotypes. This is a different type of film for a director known for Jumanji and The Rocketeer. Gyllenhaal basically goes with the flow playing the boy who must prove himself and gain his father's approval. Cooper's role is equally xeroxed as his father. Watching a sitcom father and son is far more interesting than anything these two do in this film. Laura Dern plays the teacher who is ill yet encouraging. Chris Owen completes the stereotypes as the nerd. The film is well made on a technical level but fails on the story front. Theme regards dreams within a screenplay that doesn't fly so high.
