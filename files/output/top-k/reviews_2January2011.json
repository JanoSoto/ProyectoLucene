It seems well liked amongst film writers and so I was pleased when I found it coming up on TV this week. You'll be glad to know that they are indeed correct; it's a great film with some very interesting ideas. But more of my drivel later, here's a brief summary first (summary haters please just take a jog around the block while I write the next paragraph).Lola gets a phone call from her boyfriend Manni. She was supposed to pick him up but was late because her scooter was stolen. He had to get the subway and accidentally left a bag containing 100,000 Deutschmarks on the train! The trouble is he owes this money to Ronnie, a really nasty character. Lola must raise the money and get it to him in just twenty minutes, and the clock is ticking! If she doesn't get there in time, he says he will rob the store across the street&#x85; and she doesn't want that.This is a very inventive film with many techniques used to tell the story; even animation is employed to great effect. Add to that a great soundtrack and a very clever story and you have a rather good film. As far as performances go, both Franka Potente as Lola and Moritz Bleibtreu were excellent.I love the way a possible future is played out every time Lola bumps into someone, a great idea brilliantly executed. A little trivia I noticed in the credits; some of the songs used have vocals by Franka Potente&#x85; talented girl! I should point out that the film is in German with subtitles, so if you're put off by that I would still watch it, trust me, it's worth it. Over all, it's easily the best film I've seen (so far) this year&#x85; Highly Recommended.My score 8.8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"2 January 2011","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" I had heard some good things about this one before I watched it.

I guess I've seen so many better films by now that it just doesn't cut the mustard like it did back then. But more of my thoughts later, here's a brief summary first (summary haters please wait outside the fortress and guard the horses).Conan is grieving for his lost Valeria (from the first movie) and, when he's offered a chance to bring her back from the dead, he jumps at it. Queen Taramis needs him, by now a skilled warrior, to take Princess Jehnna, who has been gifted with special sight and her bodyguard, Bombaata, on a mission to retrieve a magic crystal from an enchanted fortress. He also takes Zula (a skilled fighter), Akiro (The Wizard) and Malak (a thief). This mission proves very perilous and Conan has enemies all around him. I don't want to say any more, just on the off chance I might give too much away.Although this film had a bigger budget than the first one, I think it fails to hit the mark by quite a long way. The script is terrible and some of the effects look very dated by today's standards. Although nobody stood out, performance-wise, I will give honourable mentions to; Arnold Schwarzenegger as Conan, Grace Jones as Zula, Wilt Chamberlain as Bombaata, Mako as Akiro, Tracey Walter as Malak, Sarah Douglas as Queen Taramis and Olivia d'Abo as Princess Jehnna.I guess all fantasy adventure films will be weighed against the 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy and older films, like this, are never going to come out well. It's clear that the filmmakers put most of the money into the effects and forgot about the script, unfortunately. It's a shame because the first Conan film, Conan the Barbarian (1982), and the subsequent one, Red Sonja (1985), were so much better.

It seemed to me as a matter of fact that it had just a bunch of preaching and other meaningless political drivel.Maybe back in the 80s when this film was made the film maker may have wanted to make a statement about rape and how the victims need to fight back.

Whats more am I supposed to believe that she'd actually get away with what she did to him? He may get put away but I'm inclined to doubt that but rather she would be the one spending massive time behind bars especially if she murdered him. Whats more nothing she forced him to say would ever be allowed to be used in the court of law.

I felt that I should have stated that before I went any further. While I enjoyed this film, it was not my favorite that I have seen of his. There were some great moments, but it did not feel like an instant Allen classic. The plot is very simple, yet very complex at the same time. Woody's character has been woken up in the middle of the night and is told that he is a part of a plan which he knows nothing about. The viewers do not know anything more than he does, and so we constantly learn with him. From what we do know there is a killer on the loose, the killer only attacks when there is fog on the island, and there is currently fog on the island. Woody is then thrown into the adventure, completely unsure of what will happen next. It is very much a circus film, in which anything can happen. Not all films are able to maintain that spontaneity, yet&#x97;in this film&#x97;it works. The supporting cast is wonderful. There are a ridiculous amount of cameos. Because of the spontaneity described above, however, I did not feel that WA was trying to star up his film in the hopes that more people would go see it. Madonna as a curly-haired adulterer? Kathy Bates, Jodie Foster, and Lily Tomlin as hookers? Mia Farrow as the wife of a sword swallower? Whatever. It works. There were, however, some elements which did not fit as easily together. The tone changed several times throughout the film. Because of the fact that the film was about a killer on the loose, it would have made more sense for the paranoia and fear aspect to travel throughout the entire course. Instead, it seemed that there were interruptions of philosophical moments. While this great in films like Crimes and Misdemeanors, they felt like Woody Allen was reading philosophy books during the writing of the script and became temporarily distracted. I was hoping for the moments in which characters question reality to fit more with the plot. They did not, and the film suffered because of it. Mind you, the rest of the film was created in a fashion where these small slips were forgivable. This film was not a mess in any way and is still better than much of the material that is being released today. In the film, we are introduced (or have we already been introduced) to what WA has said is his personal belief that we are destroyed by the absence of illusions in life. To those who have not read that much on WA, this may be a very great concept. For those who have heard it before, however, it feels a little...ordinary. Though what do I know?

Quasimodo of course cannot leave his tower because of the evil man Frollo(voiced by the late Tony Jay) who raised him as his own as Quasimodo's mother died when he was a baby.The music is brilliant (Alan Menken& Stephen Schwartz who did the music for Pocahontas and Enchanted to name a few) I love the song Out There or The Belles of Notre Dame which is such a powerful song. The story is very good as it kinda reminds me of Beauty & the Beast in a way.

Some people say its like Disney's 50th but hey it kinda reminded me more of The Phantom Of The Opera in a way.Overall I loved this movie and still enjoy watching it.

It's ironic that this movie was thrown together quickly to capitalize on the success of An American in Paris, since the improvisational feeling of the movie is one of the things that makes it so much fun. Although this film is number ten on the top 100 films of all time as compiled by the American Film Institute, it wasn't nominated for best picture the year of its release, 1952. Although it did well at the box office, it would be over twenty years before people would look back and realize just what a great motion picture it was. Perhaps that was because the 1970's were such bleak and cynical years, with movies that largely matched that mood, that people were eager to rediscover the fun that a motion picture viewing experience could be.The movie focuses on that period of time in which the entire motion picture film industry was in nervous transition from silent to talking pictures. Although the movie compresses time in this respect - the transition actually took about three years - it does accurately describe the technical problems of that era along with their comical aspects. There was an overabundance of musicals in the first batch of talking films, many stars did have heavy accents that made their speech undecipherable or voices that came across like nails on a chalkboard like Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen) and saw their careers ruined, and early sound technology itself was so fragile that you would often see actors speaking to potted plants or to coat racks with comic effect. The preview of silent picture team Lockwood and Lamont's first talkie, The Dueling Cavalier, is one of the most hilarious scenes in the film. It is pretty typical of what you would see in such an early talking picture - dialogue going in and out of sync, actors and actresses strutting around and wildly gesturing as if nobody can hear them, and dialogue that still resembled what you would read off of the title cards in a silent film - I love you, I love you, I love you.All of this is one of the reasons Singin' In The Rain will never get dated - it is a comic nostalgic look at a very narrow period in time. This movie is fun outside of its comic take on movie history, though. For one, it's hard to say who steals the show the most, since there are so many thieves involved. Most notably there is Jean Hagen - who actually has a very pleasant speaking voice - as the evil silent star who can't accept her days are numbered. Then there is a 27 year-old Donald O'Connor as Cosmo, the studio music director and sidekick of Gene Kelly's character whose youthful exuberance really shines in the number Make 'Em Laugh along with all of his goofy facial expressions. He seems to be having as much fun as the audience. Finally, there are all of the great dance numbers and music, capped by probably one of the most famous scenes of all time - Gene Kelly's rendition of the title number that perfectly captures the joy of a man who has just fallen in love and feels he has the world at his feet. You just can't watch this film and not come away with a smile on your face. It is as good for the soul as chicken soup, just a lot more fun.

She's in her early 30's and single. However she's full of hope and she managed to get her boss, Daniel Cleaver, interested in her by a skirt (or lack of it) she wore to work one day. I think their relationship was too rushed and too full of sex. It's no surprise it didn't work out. After detaching herself from Daniel, she's hit on by Mark Darcy, one of her childhood acquaintances. Apparently, she fell in love with Mr. Darcy after he said that he liked Bridget just the way she was.The movie is subtly implying that women can't live without men- a woman is nothing without a man. Bridget should learn to stand up for herself. Even when single, she's already mentally and emotionally unstable, with her drinking and smoking problem! So how can she survive a relationship? Then again, this comes from a teenager who's been single since birth, so you can feel free to disregard that.Despite the subliminal messages, this movie was okay. I couldn't see Shirley Henderson as anyone other than Moaning Myrtle in the Harry Potter series. I had to pause in the beginning of the movie, when I heard her moaning\/complaining to Bridget. Anyway, this movie was not Colin Firth's best movie. And DEFINITELY not Hugh Grant's best one. However, Renée Zellweger was perfect for this role.

Her English accent wasn't that bad, either.I was turned off by Bridget's alcohol and smoking problem, but her awkwardness and silliness made her lovable and easy to relate with.

Michael Gambon, as the 'baddie', also gives what must be a career-worst movie performance and his character is more sleep-inducing than threatening. Williams also puts in what is one of his irritating\/nerve-grating performances and his one-liners fly off at such speed that they can hardly be understood (and when you have really strained yourself enough to hear one, you rapidly conclude that it was not worth the effort in any case).The GOOD news this film is an absolute visual treat. I remember being totally blown away when I saw this upon release in 1992 on the big screen and (despite having seen it quite a few times on the small screen subsequently) would go virtually any distance to see it in that format again.

And he enjoyed Humphrey Bogart's portrayal of private detective Philip Marlowe, calling Bogie the genuine article. (See Frank MacShane's The Life of Raymond Chandler for more about the troubled relationship between Chandler and Hollywood.) While Bogart does make a great Marlowe, the romantic aspect of the film *is* overemphasized and everything is a little too smooth-edged and tidy for its own good. The Los Angeles of the '30s and '40s just didn't look like this--and, more importantly, Chandler's books didn't feel like this. They were full of betrayal and disappointment and resignation, and it was precisely the author's willingness to confront these less pleasant facts of human existence that elevated his work above mere genre writing. Having said all that, The Big Sleep is an enjoyable film (miles better than anything Hollywood is grinding out today, certainly), and a few scattered scenes remain true to Chandler. Could anyone but Elisha Cook Jr., after all, have played down-at-the-heels but noble Harry Jones? And there are sexy dames to spare my favorite is the luscious Dorothy Malone as a bookstore proprietress whose beauty is ill-concealed by a pair of pince nez glasses and a prim little outfit. On the other hand, there are a few things I absolutely hate--things which depart so far from Chandler's vision as to be ridiculous, like Lauren Bacall merrily singing 'And Her Tears Flowed Like Wine' (She's a real sad tomato, she's a busted valentine!) at John Ridgely's casino. But the film is good on the whole and, again, it's more about Bogie and Bacall than it is about Chandler. With that in mind, even hardcore Chandler fanatics should get a kick out of this cool, breezy relic of a bygone age.

So basically, I started watching this movie with no expectations whatsoever. And I must say, WOW. I was blown away.This could easily be one of the best comedy flicks there are out there. The laughs I had during this movie were very numerous. The funniest scene for me was probably the first half of the Fiona-Will confrontation scene. But aside from the humor, the underlying family tones are also great.Will was sort of what you'd call a mild playboy. He wasn't as wild as Barney Stinson (HIMYM), but he does make up crazy stories to get accepted by girls that he likes. The scene where he tries picking up women in a Single Parents Alone Together club was funny. However in the end, he wizened up. He realized that there was more to life. He realized this with the help of a boy named Marcus.Marcus was a kid who kept on getting teased and bullied by his schoolmates. Aside from that, his mom, Fiona, was also problematic. Marcus seeks refuge from his world by spending time with Will who shows Marcus how to have fun. He is also a very brave kid. In one of the last scenes, where he sings in front of the whole school, that must have taken real guts. I was very impressed. But then again, it is a movie. I bet if that was real life and people were booing you off the stage, he'd burst into tears and beg his mom to let him transfer schools.Hearing Hugh Grant sing Killing Me Softly reminded me of his role in Music and Lyrics with Drew Barrymore when they sang Way Back into Love. Is it just me or does all movies where Grant features have a song solo? I think the main reason why I rated this movie so high was because I really liked seeing Marcus and Will's relationship develop. This movie isn't like your average movie where the boy falls in love with the girl and they live happily ever after and blah blah blah. Well, sure, Will falls in love with another woman, but the movie's focus wasn't on them. Majority of the movie focused on the boys' friendship and how other events affected them. That was a welcome change from all the same-plot romance movies we have now.I was expecting an average movie on a lazy, boring night, but what I got was so much more. Another favorite classic movie and high standards for other movies of the same genre. I think I'm going to read Nick Hornby's book now.

This movie isn't like your average movie where the boy falls in love with the girl and they live happily ever after and blah blah blah. Well, sure, Will falls in love with another woman, but the movie's focus wasn't on them. Majority of the movie focused on the boys' friendship and how other events affected them.

","genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance"},{"date":"2 January 2011","score":"","review":" It was a typical night for me. I was bored and didn't know what to do. I tried searching for good movies to watch and About a Boy was recommended more than two times. I decided to give it a try, but I wasn't really expecting anything. So basically, I started watching this movie with no expectations whatsoever. And I must say, WOW. I was blown away.This could easily be one of the best comedy flicks there are out there. The laughs I had during this movie were very numerous. The funniest scene for me was probably the first half of the Fiona-Will confrontation scene. But aside from the humor, the underlying family tones are also great.Will was sort of what you'd call a mild playboy. He wasn't as wild as Barney Stinson (HIMYM), but he does make up crazy stories to get accepted by girls that he likes. The scene where he tries picking up women in a Single Parents Alone Together club was funny. However in the end, he wizened up. He realized that there was more to life. He realized this with the help of a boy named Marcus.Marcus was a kid who kept on getting teased and bullied by his schoolmates. Aside from that, his mom, Fiona, was also problematic. Marcus seeks refuge from his world by spending time with Will who shows Marcus how to have fun. He is also a very brave kid. In one of the last scenes, where he sings in front of the whole school, that must have taken real guts. I was very impressed. But then again, it is a movie. I bet if that was real life and people were booing you off the stage, he'd burst into tears and beg his mom to let him transfer schools.Hearing Hugh Grant sing Killing Me Softly reminded me of his role in Music and Lyrics with Drew Barrymore when they sang Way Back into Love. Is it just me or does all movies where Grant features have a song solo?

It was a momentous occasion as the crew of the original Enterprise (well Kirk, Scotty, and Chekov...) pass the torch to the crew of the Enterprise-D. It's a shame that the first movie from the NEXT GENERATION crew arrived with a fizzle. The film focuses on a temporal nexus that passes through the galaxy; those who come in contact with the nexus are treated to their greatest desires. Captain Kirk (Shatner) disappeared on the first cruise of the Enterprise-B when it encountered the nexus on a rescue mission when ships containing El-Aurian refugees become trapped in it's grasp. 78 years later, the crew of the Enterprise-D encounter the same nexus when Dr. Tolian Soran (McDowell), an El-Aurian obsessed with returning to the nexus, begins demolishing stars to divert it's path. Now the crew of the Enterprise-D must stop Soran from destroying the sun of the Veridian system and killing billions in his quest.The crew of the NEXT GENERATION series are given their chance to shine and it doesn't go well. All of the characters fans have come to know and love are here and I suppose they all do admirably with what they're given (with one exception). Shatner's at his best in his final appearance as Kirk and it was a treat to see James Doohan and Walter Koenig popping in for a short cameo at the beginning of the film. Particularly Doohan, who seemed genuinely upset when it appeared that Kirk had died saving the ship. The film's villain, Tolian Soran, is the ever-awesome Malcolm McDowell. He does a great job as expected, and he could've been even better if utilized in a better story.Now, fans of the series won't be entirely disappointed. The film feels as if you're watching a two-part episode of the show. I'm sure this was to be expected with a director and writing team who'd worked on it often. The problem lies in the fact that this is a movie, not a TV show, and we expect a more cinematic experience. With the exception of some great cinematography from John Alonzo, this could've passed for your average season-ending two-parter. The filmmakers attempt to amp up the cinematic feel by adding some subplots that run through the movie. Captain Picard (Stewart) copes with the recent deaths of his family as the result of a fire at their vineyard, and it plays in somewhat well with the mortality theme presented by the nexus plot. Meanwhile, there is also an entire subplot dedicated to Data (Spiner) deciding to finally install his emotion chip and the zaniness that results. Laughing fits, cowardice, Mr. Tricorder, and Data's first curse word (that I'm aware of)...honestly, the film could've done without it. It adds nothing to the story and only serves to give Brent Spiner more to do with his continuing role in the features.Seriously, I would've been all right with all of these flaws if the film didn't grind to a complete halt the moment Picard is drawn into the nexus. Around halfway through the film, the movie is running at an exciting pace the Enterprise-D is under attack from a Klingon Bird-of-Prey that has found a means around it's shields and Picard is battling Soran to the end on the surface of Veridian III. Then, suddenly, it all lurches to a stop while we celebrate Christmas with the Picards in the captain's nexus experience. From there, we get a slow sequence of Picard trying to convince Kirk to return to reality to help him battle Soran and it just drags on. No excitement whatsoever. There's the ooh and aah factor of Picard and Kirk face-to-face but the feeling passes and we're left waiting for something, anything to happen to get us interested again. The entire last half of the movie is anticlimactic and killed the experience for me.At least it's not a terrible movie. It's just not all that memorable. The film has some highlights and, as long as you're all right with Data's wacky shenanigans, the crew does their usual good work. It was just a weak story (and the writers agree...it's true...listen to their commentary) wrapped around the sole purpose of passing the torch from original series to it's successors. For those who are watching the film for the first time as an introduction to the NEXT GENERATION films, try not to hold GENERATIONS against them. It gets better with FIRST CONTACT.
