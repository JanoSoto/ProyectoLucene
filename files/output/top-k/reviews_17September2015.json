Basically Max Fischer (Saving Mr. Banks' Jason Schwartzman) is a mature and eccentric fifteen year old scholarship student at Rushmore Academy, a private school in Houston, he is the most extracurricular and least scholarly student, he spends most of his time running many school groups and cares little about his grades. Herman Blume (Golden Globe nominated Bill Murray) is a disillusioned industrialist who is unsatisfied with his multimillion dollar company's operation, his marriage failing is frustrating him, and his two sons attending Rushmore are brats, he becomes close friends with Max, admiring his cocksure attitude, Max admires Herman's success. Max quickly develops an infatuation with widowed teacher Rosemary Cross (The Sixth Sense's Olivia Williams), the new arrival at the academy, he attempts to court her many times, she slowly realises his obsession for her, Herman tries to convince him she is not worth the effort, but Herman, without Max's knowledge, begins dating her himself. Without the school's approval, Max tries to break ground on an aquarium, he ends up getting expelled from Rushmore, forcing him to enrol in Grover Cleveland High, his first public school, he has mixed results engaging in outside activities, he pays little attention to fellow student Margaret Yang (Sara Tanaka) who tries to engage with him, but he has support from Herman and Rosemary. Max's friend Dirk Calloway (Dennis's Mason Gamble) wants payback for a rumour Max spread about his mother, he discovers the relationship between Herman and Rosemary and informs Max, therefore Max and Herman go from friends to mortal enemies, engaging in back-and-forth acts of revenge. This includes Max ending Blume's marriage informing his wife of his affair, Max putting bees in Blume's hotel room, Blume destroying Max's bicycle with his car, and Max getting arrested for cutting the brakes on Blume's car. Max eventually gives up on any more revenge, knowing that whatever he tries Rosemary would still love Blume, he becomes depressed, stops attending school, cuts himself from the world and becomes an apprentice at his father's barber shop, one day Dirk comes by to apologise to Max and give him a Christmas present. Max is tricked into reuniting with Herman by Dirk, going to hospital where his old headmaster is, they are courteous, and Max finds out that Herman and Rosemary broke up, shortly after Max returns to school and develops a friendship with Margaret. Max makes one last attempt to get close with Rosemary, soliciting her affection pretending she has been injured in a car accident, but she finds out the truth and rejects him harshly, so Max makes it his mission to get Rosemary and Blume back together. His first attempt at this fails, but then he invites them to a play he wrote, making sure they will sit together, in the end Rosemary and Herman seem to reconcile, Max shares a slow dance with Rosemary at the wrap party, but ultimately he finds himself a relationship with Margaret. Also starring Brian Cox as Dr. Nelson Guggenheim, Seymour Cassel as Bert Fischer, Luke Wilson as Dr. Peter Flynn and One Hour Photo's Connie Nielsen as Mrs. Calloway. This is the first film for Schwartzman, he gives a good performance as the odd megalomaniacal nerd, Williams is likable as the British teacher, and Murray does steal most of the scenes he is in as the depressed millionaire being quirky and edgy. It is a rather simple format, the unconventional outsider teen hero who may have the ability to turn those who laugh or are against him, it has intriguing characters and interactions, and a witty script, I did find myself laughing at the right moments and it was interesting, it's a black comedy drama worth watching.

This formula for a romantic comedy is all right when all you want to do is pass the time watching a mildly amusing movie. But when it is one of the movies listed in Steven Jay Schneider's 1001 Movies You Must See before You Die, you expect a little more. I suspect it is the fact that Cameron Crowe wrote and directed this movie that mesmerized critics into thinking it was something special.In addition to the formula noted above, this movie also employs the standard Hollywood device of having a woman forced to make a choice between love and something else, and then when she chooses love, as the formula requires, she ends up getting the something else too. Usually, the woman's choice is between a boring but respectable man whom her family approves of and who will be able to provide for her in comfort, and a charming man that she loves but who is poor and irresponsible. But when she decides to marry the poor guy, it turns out he has all the money. The movie French Kiss (1995) would be an example of this.In this movie, the woman is Diane, and she herself is the boring but respectable person whom her father, Mr. Court, approves of and who will be able to provide for herself in comfort owing to the fact that she is on her way to having a successful career after she gets out of college. This constitutes a slight variation in the formula. In any event, she must choose between her own education\/career and Lloyd, the poor and irresponsible guy she loves whose idea of a career is that of being a kickboxer. Of course, there are movies in which a woman must choose between a career and a husband, but it is usually a glamorous career like show business, as in Imitation of Life (1959), not the kind of respectable career that Diane is pursuing.Actually, Lloyd's charm wears a little thin. He is living with his sister, who is a single mom, and he gets on her nerves with his antics. She makes a mark for the volume knob on his boom box, beyond which level he must not go, because it disturbs the neighbors. But he apparently does not care about that, because later in the movie, he takes the boom box and plays his and Diane's song at volume ten near her house in the middle of the night to prove his love for her, probably waking up all the neighbors on the block. It is one thing to be irresponsible. It is another thing to be an inconsiderate jerk. One wonders just how long Diane is going to put up with him, especially since his plan seems to be to just let her support him, as when he tells her father, What I want to do for a living is be with your daughter. I guess you could say that in this movie it is the man who chooses between having a glamorous career like kickboxing and just being a house husband.Presumably as a way of avoiding the obvious formulaic nature of this film, a little trouble for Mr. Court with the Internal Revenue Service is added in. It begins rather melodramatically, with a couple of IRS agents showing up at his house at night. In real life, an auditor would begin his investigation by showing up at Court's place of business, which is a nursing home, and asking to see the books. In a subsequent scene, an IRS agent does show up at the nursing home and asks ominous questions like, Your income, Mr. Court, hasn't changed substantially in seventeen years&#x85;. Why would you stay so long with an operation that is clearly not a growth enterprise? Wow! Isn't that incriminating!By this time, we are starting to think that the IRS agents are absurd caricatures, and that Court will be vindicated in the end. But it turns out that Court really is guilty. However, if he has been stealing money from his patients, then it would seem he is in more trouble than just not paying his taxes. There should still be fraud charges to deal with. But the movie glosses over that.Once we accept that Court is guilty of defrauding his nursing home patients, there are further incongruities that the movie presents without explaining. For example, Court goes to a store to buy some luggage, but all his credit cards are rejected. At the same time, Diane discovers thousands of dollars in cash squirreled away in a drawer. So, why didn't Court use the cash to buy the luggage? Cash leaves no tracks, and even the IRS would not have been aware of that purchase.Beyond that, the movie seems to at first to suggest that Court was stealing all that money in order to provide for his daughter, and so we are supposed to like him for that. But then it turns out that he was using all of his ill-gotten gains to buy collectibles, like a nine thousand dollar juke box. In other words, he's an idiot. The function of this IRS subplot is to break the excessive attachment between father and daughter so that she is free to leave him for Lloyd. But calling in the Feds so that a girl can leave home and marry the boy she loves is a bit much.

Basically a year has passed since previous events, two graduating high school students are on a houseboat on Crystal Lake getting frisky, then the anchor is weighed and causes an underwater cable to snap, and the electric charge causes the corpse of killer Jason Voorhees (Kane Hodder) to resurrect, he finds a new hockey mask and quickly kills the two occupants. The next morning a senior class of graduating students from Lakeview High School, chaperoned by biology teacher Charles McCulloch (The Naked Gun 2½ The Smell of Fear's Peter Mark Richman) and English teacher Colleen Van Deusen (Barbara Bingham), are setting sail on the SS Lazarus, bound for New York City. McCulloch's niece Rennie Wickham (Jensen Daggett) has aquaphobia, and has heard all the legends of killer Jason when he was drowned as a child, every now and then she has been seeing visions of the young disfigured child Jason. Slowly strange and nasty things start happening to the people on the ship, both students and crew, McCulloch does not want to hear that Jason Voorhees is to blame, but of course once he sees the violence for himself and the actual maniac in the flesh, he thinks different. After many killings, the surviving passengers aboard, McCulloch, Van Deusen, Rennie, Sean Robertson (Scott Reeves), Toby the dog (Ace) and Julius Gaw (Vincent Craig Dupree) abandon ship and escape in a lifeboat, leaving Jason behind presumably dead, they are relieved when they finally reach the dock and outskirts of New York City. Of course they are unaware that Jason is still alive and followed them all the way and is stalking them, Rennie ends up getting kidnapped by two punks and the group are split up, the punks are killed when Jason comes along. As the others are killed by Jason, it is revealed that Rennie's fear of water was caused by McCullough, he pushed her into the water of Crystal Lake as a child, hence her visions of Jason as a child, the killer chases his victims through Times Square and the subways. Jason's kills include stabbing with a harpoon barb, impaling, killing with an electric guitar, slamming a sauna rock into an abdomen, an axe in the back, decapitation in a single punch, incinerated in an exploding car, drowning in a barrel of waste and much more. In the end Jason chases the last survivors through the sewers, where toxic waste surrounds them, he is finally defeated by a splash of acidic waste, then the whole place is flooded as Rennie and Sean escape up the ladder, but Jason will return. Also starring Sharlene Martin as Tamara Mason, Martin Cummins as Wayne Webber, Tim Burr Mirkovich as Young Jason, Amber Pawlick as Young Rennie, Gordon Currie as Miles Wolfe, X-Men 2's Kelly Hu as Eva Watanabe, Saffron Henderson as J.J. Jarrett, Warren Munson as Admiral Robertson, Tiffany Paulsen as Suzi Donaldson and Todd Caldecott\/Shaffer as Jim Miller. Jason is still sinister, but the moment just after his defeat - seeing him as a child, and a few times throughout in visions, is ridiculous, there are a few good bloody deaths, but not enough, also the Big Apple is only seen a little with the lights in the dark, it is more so set down the dark alleys and beneath, to be honest I didn't find this sequel as good as I hoped it would be, but it's not a bad horror.

Of course they are unaware that Jason is still alive and followed them all the way and is stalking them, Rennie ends up getting kidnapped by two punks and the group are split up, the punks are killed when Jason comes along. As the others are killed by Jason, it is revealed that Rennie's fear of water was caused by McCullough, he pushed her into the water of Crystal Lake as a child, hence her visions of Jason as a child, the killer chases his victims through Times Square and the subways. Jason's kills include stabbing with a harpoon barb, impaling, killing with an electric guitar, slamming a sauna rock into an abdomen, an axe in the back, decapitation in a single punch, incinerated in an exploding car, drowning in a barrel of waste and much more. In the end Jason chases the last survivors through the sewers, where toxic waste surrounds them, he is finally defeated by a splash of acidic waste, then the whole place is flooded as Rennie and Sean escape up the ladder, but Jason will return. Also starring Sharlene Martin as Tamara Mason, Martin Cummins as Wayne Webber, Tim Burr Mirkovich as Young Jason, Amber Pawlick as Young Rennie, Gordon Currie as Miles Wolfe, X-Men 2's Kelly Hu as Eva Watanabe, Saffron Henderson as J.J. Jarrett, Warren Munson as Admiral Robertson, Tiffany Paulsen as Suzi Donaldson and Todd Caldecott\/Shaffer as Jim Miller. Jason is still sinister, but the moment just after his defeat - seeing him as a child, and a few times throughout in visions, is ridiculous, there are a few good bloody deaths, but not enough, also the Big Apple is only seen a little with the lights in the dark, it is more so set down the dark alleys and beneath, to be honest I didn't find this sequel as good as I hoped it would be, but it's not a bad horror.

Where do I begin? Well, I give you one thing about what is the plot of this ridiculous movie another great white shark comes in, but instead of attacking more people it wants revenge on the Brody family. Wow! That has got to be one of the most stupidest and ridiculous plot that I've ever heard in my entire life. From the show Siskel & Ebert, Roger Ebert asks Gene Siskel what shark is this? A brother? Cousin? Maybe a distant relative? I don't know, but this revenge plot really makes no sense at all; its hardly a revenge movie because the movie keeps focusing more on some parts that we don't care, and while the shark only pops in whatever it feels like it. If its not focusing well with the revenge plot, then just call it Jaws 4. Also, the movie has many errors like Michael Caine's character coming out of the water while his clothes is almost completely dried off (thanks to Siskel & Ebert); then you have the shark that knows where to find our human characters from traveling the United States to the Bahamas, and last but not least, the shark roars like a lion. Sharks can't roar! Here is another thing, how is the shark able to reach out to eat people by what using its tippy toes or thinking that the shark is Mr. Fantastic? I blame how the movie was written by a bad screenplay. Even the movie is badly directed by Joseph Sargent who also produced this. Do both the writer and director know that sharks can't roar, and making some dumb excuses that the shark is being powered by the magic of voodoo? Heck, they made Martin Brody's wife Ellen who she thinks is Spider-Man that her sharky senses are tingling, and having these flashbacks that she wasn't there. Except where she witnesses her granddaughter who almost got killed by shark, and watching her late husband and son having their moment at a dinner table from the first one. The dialogue in this movie is really terrible like Ellen's granddaughter asking about Uncle Sean coming back. Uh...he just got killed by a shark, and can't come back. Such a dumb question that she brought up. I really hated that the filmmakers made Ellen saying that her husband died because not only a heart attack, but his fear of sharks. Lorraine Gary should've know about this, as she may have seen the first two movies where Martin was trying to be brave and strong to kill two sharks; she could've say no to say that line because its really insulting to Roy Scheider's character, but no the filmmakers want her to say it and just made everyone mad on how much we love Roy Scheider from the first two movies. I find it just as bad as making Megan Fox's character looked bad in the third Transformers movie, where she was replaced by a model that can't act. I don't think the acting in this movie is good, and I don't buy Lorraine Gary as the lead. She is no Ellen Ripley. By the way, I like to point out that when she sees her granddaughter almost get killed by a shark, she steals a boat or ship as we know that she can't take it anymore but here is one question if she is going to steal a boat to find the shark, then why can't she bring any weapons to kill it? She is not well prepared onto anything. Heck, after Sean dies at the opening scene, some cop leaves Ellen her son's gun and never bothers to take it with her to kill the shark. Well Ellen, you are some hero. You know that? Some hero. I do feel sad for Michael Caine for doing this movie, and I think I'm sure that he regretted for not attending the Academy Awards for getting his Oscar on his work for Hannah and Her Sisters. I never saw that movie, but I wish if he hadn't done this movie. The shark itself looks good on the first three movies (while the third movie made the shark cheap looking in 3D), but here its so darn fake looking. The effects in this movie are just as bad as the effects from Superman IV The Quest for Peace. This movie won the Razzie for Worst Visual Effect over the fourth Superman movie. The movie has two ending that were filmed one the shark gets stabbed, and two it explodes for no reason while Michael Brody's friend survives. I don't care which ending I like best, because they both have bad effects and they're both lame. I do kind of like Caine's reaction of the shark before his plane got taken down. Oh, I also don't care for the music either. You wish if this movie never existed, but hey this is the last one and I am glad that its all over. I think the Sharknado movies are more entertaining than the last two Jaws sequels. I give Jaws The Revenge a flat out zero. But I have to give it a one, because giving it a zero won't make its 2.8 rating go down. I wish I could, but got to be respectful to IMDb's rating system; and seriously, this movie sucks!

Eastwood directs very well. His use of darkness in the climactic showdown in the apartment is excellent. Full of pop out, scare the living crap out of you scenes, I recommend you finish eating before a half hour into this movie unless someone in the room knows the Heimlich maneuver. What Eastwood does so well is build her craziness from slightly odd to absolute Norman Bates' Whacko. I assure you this is the movie Adrian Lynne watched before making Fatal Attraction. Eastwood's character is very understated, quiet and laid back which heightens the dramatic contrast. Besides her terrible taste in music, she begins trying to take over his life after a one night stand. He has a much better and hotter girlfriend he is interested in. She begins stalking him through the middle part of the movie but don't let that keep you away; she pops out when you least expect it. Even Eastwood's friends and workers are not immune from her violence. Jessica does a great job here in a very unsympathetic role. The way Eastwood builds tension is the star of the movie. Notice how every scene with Walter she gets slightly weirder and more violent.Even before the one night stand that triggers the obsession, she reacts with great rage to any irritation. This is what triggers Eastwood to dump her. Good luck, she has made some sicko twisto lock onto him that only death, his, hers or both of theirs will break. I really like Eastwood but be warned, keep that remote control handy. He has always adored Jazz music even in In The Line Of Fire, we had to endure his jazz piano scenes which slow it way down. Here, he felt the need to take us to the Monterey Jazz Festival which chews up ten or fifteen minutes needlessly. You can do what we couldn't do in the theater, hit the chapter skip button unless you love Jazz. Again, like In The Line Of Fire, it was a mistake. The movie moves very well until you get to the Jazz Festival which in a scary movie kills the intensity. No movie is perfect but pacing is so critical in a scary movie. This is the main flaw of the movie. Yet, it plays with you, just like Fatal Attraction, the old 'she is gone forever and we are safe now.' My favorite scene is not the scary ending though that comes close. I love when he is half awake, we think she is in the nut house, and in a foggy lens we see her come in and try to stab him with a butcher knife in bed.He barely awakens in time. I own both of these but frankly this is far superior to Fatal Attraction; I hated Dan's friends that big unfunny comedian and wife who slow the movie way, way down. I liked Close's Alex but this one is scarier she is one convincing lunatic. As for the Jazz festival, just skip it like I do. The last ten minutes of this movie will scare the living crap out of you. Yes, I know the decor, 70's argot, and the norms will seem quite anachronistic and odd. It was the weirdest time in American history The 1970's. For all its flaws, it made Clint the director he would become. In a genre utterly alien to his acting Icon, Dirty Harry or The Man With No Name, he made an excellent, scary movie.

Of course, as the go-to-guy for horror movies, my least favourite genre, I had to scan through his filmography to find the bizarrely out-of-character film Music of the Heart. As the only non-horror film on the list, it won the honour fairly easily.It surprises me to no end that a horror film maestro could create what is probably one of the best feel-good movies I have ever seen. I can pick a passion project when I see it, and I am positive that Craven was passionate about this story and to telling it right. When I was growing up, music lessons were everything to me. You could escape into a whole other world when you practised, and the instrument became a friend when none other might be. This film captured that more than any other I've seen. For a character who looks and sounds like Meryl Streep, it is amazing how much Meryl Streep vanishes into Roberta. She captures with full conviction the passion she has for her music, whilst also layering her character with personality quirks that inform us why her marriage has broken down. Streep layers that with bursts of anger, sadness and even humour that never feel out of place because they feel like Roberta's real emotions. She could have walked into my high school's music department and wouldn't have felt even a little bit out of place. This is probably my favourite ever Meryl Streep performance. From an unknown supporting cast, Angela Basset is stunningly effective as Janet, a Harlem principal holding a school together with her bare hands.The film essentially splits into two halves, with a ten year break in between. The first is Roberta's struggle to deal with the breakdown of her marriage and her desire to make the program work not to help the kids, but to make ends meet. But as the first act goes on, interactions with the kids show her how much the program means to them - even the troublemakers who give her flack but show up week after week in spite of everything. In the second half, ten years later than the first, Roberta's program is in jeopardy and she must fight to maintain it, because she has seen now how much good it can do. The relationship between Roberta and the kids - especially Jade Yorker's DeSean and Victoria Gomez's Lucy - is beautiful and believable, even as she occasionally hits stumbling blocks associated with kids in Harlem - incidental murders, domestic violence and hostility from black parents. Screenwriter Pamela Gray does a terrific job avoiding the trappings of White Saviour but focusing more on how music helps children, regardless of who their teacher is. Sometimes I felt that there were a few unnecessary subplots, such as Roberta's love life - both of her love interests fizzle out without much impact on the story. Other times, serious moments are swept over quickly, like when a father and daughter turn up to the concert announcing they took the car and violin, which is quickly ignored. But I watched this film with a smile on my face the whole way through - just as the proud parents beamed at their underprivileged children performing beautiful music on stage. I would never have though to find such a feel-good movie in the filmography of a great horror director, but it just goes to show that just like music in the hearts of Harlem, you should never judge a book by its cover.

Of course, as the go-to-guy for horror movies, my least favourite genre, I had to scan through his filmography to find the bizarrely out-of-character film Music of the Heart. As the only non-horror film on the list, it won the honour fairly easily.It surprises me to no end that a horror film maestro could create what is probably one of the best feel-good movies I have ever seen. I can pick a passion project when I see it, and I am positive that Craven was passionate about this story and to telling it right. When I was growing up, music lessons were everything to me. You could escape into a whole other world when you practised, and the instrument became a friend when none other might be. This film captured that more than any other I've seen. For a character who looks and sounds like Meryl Streep, it is amazing how much Meryl Streep vanishes into Roberta. She captures with full conviction the passion she has for her music, whilst also layering her character with personality quirks that inform us why her marriage has broken down. Streep layers that with bursts of anger, sadness and even humour that never feel out of place because they feel like Roberta's real emotions. She could have walked into my high school's music department and wouldn't have felt even a little bit out of place. This is probably my favourite ever Meryl Streep performance. From an unknown supporting cast, Angela Basset is stunningly effective as Janet, a Harlem principal holding a school together with her bare hands.The film essentially splits into two halves, with a ten year break in between. The first is Roberta's struggle to deal with the breakdown of her marriage and her desire to make the program work not to help the kids, but to make ends meet. But as the first act goes on, interactions with the kids show her how much the program means to them - even the troublemakers who give her flack but show up week after week in spite of everything. In the second half, ten years later than the first, Roberta's program is in jeopardy and she must fight to maintain it, because she has seen now how much good it can do. The relationship between Roberta and the kids - especially Jade Yorker's DeSean and Victoria Gomez's Lucy - is beautiful and believable, even as she occasionally hits stumbling blocks associated with kids in Harlem - incidental murders, domestic violence and hostility from black parents. Screenwriter Pamela Gray does a terrific job avoiding the trappings of White Saviour but focusing more on how music helps children, regardless of who their teacher is. Sometimes I felt that there were a few unnecessary subplots, such as Roberta's love life - both of her love interests fizzle out without much impact on the story. Other times, serious moments are swept over quickly, like when a father and daughter turn up to the concert announcing they took the car and violin, which is quickly ignored. But I watched this film with a smile on my face the whole way through - just as the proud parents beamed at their underprivileged children performing beautiful music on stage. I would never have though to find such a feel-good movie in the filmography of a great horror director, but it just goes to show that just like music in the hearts of Harlem, you should never judge a book by its cover.

Max as the infamous head vampire is just perfect and all other characters give solid performances. I think I've seen this film close to 100 times. All in all.

My header is his famous quote about Gotham. It is now applicable to where I am writing from. With Palance as Boss Grisham and Hingle as Gordon the acting and Burton's dark direction give the movie the Gothic nature of the comic that make it legendary. Unrelentingly dark with humor as black as pitch, with the Joker as the world's 'first homicidal artist.' Nicholson adds humor which I found absent in Ledger's delineation. Yes, he was sinister but remember his name? The Joker, could we have some humor when you portray him? Here, the handshake from Hell is drop dead funny, no pun intended. The entire movie is almost all shot at night, a couple day interiors but Burton keeps it dark all the time as an existential metaphor for Batman. The death of his parents is here without consuming a half an hour. The tragedy that metamorphosed him into the duality that he became half light and half night. Keaton will surprise you with how well he plays him. I liked Bale but notice how Keaton acts eccentric as Bruce Wayne yet cold and sinister as Batman. He really surprised us in 1989, he had been a comic actor up to this point this is the movie that branched him out into serious genres.There is good support with Basinger, stunningly hot, and Billy Dee Williams. I liked Caine's Alfred but Michael Gough always played him so well. Here he gently oversees Wayne's kooky rich eccentricity, watch him take the pen out of the plant and the champagne glass on the tray. For me, even with the dreadful Prince music, Nicholson's Joker is why I adore the movie. Who will forget You wouldn't hit a guy with glasses would you? She's about to trade up, A woman like this could put steam back in your stride. He is scary but also commensurately funny. Ledger had a couple of funny lines but nothing like this. The effects may be dated but they still are effective. My only problem has always been Hollywood Knight's Robert Wuhl who always gets on my nerves. He is not as insufferable as he was in that vulgar, gross out festival but he is still annoying here. He always finds himself drop dead funny, I wish I did. The stars of the movie, besides the cast and acting, are the great comic accurate Gothic design and photography which are so evocative of the dark comic. Burton always was the director since he loves dark imagery with satirical dialog. Yet, it never devolves into Superman 3. There are just a few laughing at itself moments; from my point of view, the best Batman movie ever made. I waited in line to see it for two hours when it was released. I did not regret it. Word of mouth spread rapidly, it was moved into the big cinemas of every multiplex. Those of you who are avoiding it because of Keaton will be stunned how well he does here in a demanding role that calls for wide range. Be warned, not for kiddies, the humor is as dark as the imagery. This is not the cornball TV show, thank heavens. Burton darkens it further in the next one Batman Returns which I liked but it scared the crap out of too many kiddies. Even here, I would not show this to children below twelve. It may not be violent graphically but Nicholson's joker is one scary, creepy psycho. When you say Batman, this is the movie I think of. A Great Movie.

Leary is ahead of him the entire movie until Frank stops the assassination. Find me another Eastwood movie where the villain is way in front of our 'hero' the entire movie? Yes, maybe Tightrope but that was one awful movie. Malkovich does his usual credible job of creeping us out here with his icy sociopath who kills people, like the fishermen, with the emotional content of pushing a button. That is one creepy scene where he closes the front door on the banker lady and her partner that asked one too many questions at her bank. Eastwood also is delineated as a worn out old guy who screws up, can barely breathe and gets canned from the protection detail not exactly the portrayal of Josie Wales? Yet, this is what makes his role work, his age is written into the narrative; he even chickens out and gets his partner killed by not sacrificing himself when Leary is holding him on the building ledge. I understand the above attacks on the length; Peterson did the same thing with Perfect Storm it was way too long with many extraneous, irrelevant scenes. The movie still is worth owning for the two performances and the rare against type depiction of Frank. Dirty Harry he is not but a worn out guilt riddled human being who makes plenty of mistakes but keeps coming. His persistence not his invincibility, as in most of his other films, is what defeats Leary. Yes, I agree the romance was a stretch, given the age difference, but it was necessary to reveal what was going on inside of him. The clever planning with the plastic gun, Leary's way of donating his way next to the president, I found both pieces of excellent writing. When you revisit the movie, you just wish the director had trimmed some of the length so it had a better flow to it. Even as it is, with its flaws, it far surpasses the only other detective Eastwood film, Tightrope, in going against the Dirty Harry Type.

There's a little wrinkle in that theory though, and it's called 'The Search For Spock'.It's a sequel in the truest sense of the word, picking up basically right where 'Khan' left off. Leonard Nimoy steps behind the camera and does a nice job, delivering two knock-out sequences in the stealing of the Enterprise and the subsequent destruction of the Enterprise. The former is a really fun heist bit with some outstanding model work and the latter is another in a long line of great Kirk escapes, but this one comes at a terrible cost.Speaking of Kirk, I think Shatner's best performance as the character comes in 'Khan', but he's also quite good here, giving the Kirk a rare vulnerability; first in dealing with the grief over the loss of his best friend, and then the murder of his Son. The rest of the crew get a few moments, which I credit to Nimoy, who I'm sure was keen to give them more to do than spout bridge gibberish. Not faring so well is Christopher Lloyd as the Klingon villain. He certainly goes for it, and he has some really nice moments, but he often comes across like Reverend Jim doing Trek cosplay.The mechanics of bringing Spock back from the dead are a bunch of hogwash, but you just go with it because you want to see Spock back. Does it cheapen his death\/sacrifice in 'Wrath Of Khan' ex post facto? Maybe a little, but it's one I'm willing to swallow to have him around for the next two flicks.While not in the same league as 'Wrath Of Khan', nor perhaps as clever and thoughtful as 'Undiscovered Country', 'Search For Spock' both advances the ball from part II and stands on its own, putting friendship and camaraderie front and center and delivering a reasonably fun and occasionally moving film.

The rest of the crew get a few moments, which I credit to Nimoy, who I'm sure was keen to give them more to do than spout bridge gibberish.

However, Derek's life seemingly takes a turn for the better when he's hired by Mugatu (Will Ferrell), but Mugatu isn't who he seems to be and it turns out that he intends to hypnotise Derek to get him to kill the President Of Malaysia.Despite the stupidity of the premise, this could have actually stood a chance. The storyline is daft, but to its credit it is at least original and fairly imaginative. Ben Stiller and his co-writers also got the characterisations of the models right; both Zoolander and Hansel are self-absorbed, shallow, and unintelligent which are very much the given clichés for models. This is all well and good, but what the film lacks is any real laughs (I don't think I laughed once). The humour that did exist wrapped around the same concepts (the models being self-absorbed, shallow and unintelligent) and it got to the point where it became tiresome and uninteresting.I was also surprised about the casting of Owen Wilson as a model. Whilst Stiller isn't that convincing either Wilson is less believable given the fact that his nose looks like it's been smashed with a hammer about a dozen times. I wouldn't mention any of this if the idea of them being the two best looking men around was something that was merely a figment of their imaginations, but the fact that we're genuinely meant to go along with this means that it lacks some of the irony that I'm sure that Stiller and co were striving for. Sticking with performances I found Will Ferrell to be not funny here and too much most of the time. Everyone else was OK, but there weren't any standout performances. This film is probably best remembered for the numerous cameos that are seen here and yes they're fun for a bit, but it gets to the point where spotting the cameos starts to lose its appeal.Zoolander has a promising and original idea, but sadly the material isn't great and the result is a film with very few laughs. Most attempts at humour are either predictable or simply not funny. Many of the performances are over the top and irritating (particularly Will Ferrell who was unbearable). To its credit, Zoolander does have quite a good, positive end to it, but unfortunately it has far too much working against it and is a film that is best avoided.

The movie is about a green beret named John Rambo (Sylvester Stallone) who returns home after the Vietnam war, only to find that nobody has any interest in befriending him due to all the negative press from the war. This cold reaction to Rambo escalates when he walks into a small, Pacific Northwest town to reunite with one of his buddies from the war, only to be told that he was killed by Agent Orange when he came back to the States. While feeling dejected and somber, Rambo wanders into town and is eventually identified by the town sheriff Will Teasle (Brian Dennehy) who, like many other Americans, didn't approve of Rambo's presence and insisted he leave his town. The plot escalates further when he's unjustifiably arrested for vagrancy and brutalized at the police station repeatedly by other deputies. As Rambo is getting harassed and beaten, the officers show a noticeable pleasure from inflicting pain on him. As you continue to watch this misconduct unfold, you begin to crave some sort of retaliation against this oppressive police force from Rambo, but he remains docile.

The film takes a little bit to get going, which can be bothersome for some viewers who only want to see the monsters, but it makes up for it about 1\/3rd of the way through when Godzilla reaches the shore of Japan and starts causing destruction. The destruction and battle scenes are top-notch, and it ends with one of the most iconic duels in cinematic history. Every second of the final battle is entertaining and memorable, whether it be Kong humorously shoving a tree down Godzilla's throat or Godzilla knocking Kong over, only for Kong to come back with a surge of electrical power.The human characters are also pretty memorable, if not a bit one-note. My absolute favorite has to be the bumbling Mr. Tako, who, throughout Godzilla's rampage, appears to be getting progressively angrier.The humor in the film, while funny at times, can clash with the overall tone of the movie. There are some legitimately funny jokes, but I feel as if they don't really work well when the next scene consists of Godzilla or Kong destroying buildings and such. The special effects are standard Showa Godzilla fare consisting of cheesy-looking suits with a couple instances of puppets\/one very jarring shot with stop-motion. Despite the dated effects, it gives the film that certain charm the older Godzilla films had. Eiji Tsuburaya had a knack for doing a lot with what he was given, and was willing to experiment in some scenes (like the aforementioned jarring stop-motion shot).The soundtrack is, without a doubt, my favorite OST in the series. It features the first appearance of Godzilla's iconic theme, and OST's usage matches perfectly with the film. All of the tracks have this grand feel to them, highlighting the presence of the two giant monsters.Overall It's a fun film. It features clever comedy and fun special effect scenes. The film's tone is a little odd at times, but it's still a fun time.

With two of his films, Blazing Saddles and Young Frankenstein represented in the Box Office top 10, he was America's funniest man. Mel Brooks has his own atypical style, but both pictures differ in their ways of being funny and it's almost an impossible task to agree on which one is the best. So in retrospect I watched his Blazing Saddles, probably the funniest Western ever made. The story line is quite... well, let's call it unstructured. Though we can find a certain plot in this total mess. Blazing Saddles tells the tale about some untrustworthy land speculators who are constructing a railroad, with only one problem. The railroad needs to run through a town called Rock Ridge and they need to find a way to drive the townsfolk out. They hope to accomplish this by sending a black sheriff so the townspeople will revolt. Then again the film has so many things happening at the same time it's hard to give a good synopsis. Because in the end this film was created for the purpose of being funny, and damn it is! It feels like as if Mel Brooks can literally get away with anything, and people will let him say or do anything because he has earned this privilege since the distinctively funny debut The Producers (1968). Brooks does everything to keep us laughing at the screen, and overall he succeeds. To truly understand these kind of films you must understand that this is an audience movie. It is pure entertainment for your jaws and doesn't try to be an over-polished film in any way. And Blazing Saddles is pure entertainment from beginning to end, sure there are some slow bits though maybe these are a necessity to rest the jaw muscles for a while. Blazing Saddles is the perfect introduction for those who are not yet familiar with Brooks' work. What makes him stand out from your typical satirist is his ability to willingly embrace the redundancy of everything . His humor is more than just vulgarity and something he will always be remembered for. Brooks has no taste, which makes it in some weird way tasteful, and well, if you don't understand that, stick with your Scary Movie franchise I'd say.

Keenan Ivory Wayans successfully keeps the substance and brain of Scream and takes the smarts of other movies to make one big laugh fest. The two main movies is parodies are Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer. It also includes Sixth Sense, The Usual Suspects, The Matrix, Buffy The Vampire Slayer and Dawson's Creek among others. Most spoof movies these days to atrocious jobs of putting various things together. Movies like Disaster Movie and Epic Movie throw in random things just because they can. Scary Movie uses a solid bases and similar things that flow together. Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer are both teen horror movies that deal with a killer whom they try to find out his identity. Dawson's Creek is a high school drama, and that vibe could easily fit in with the horrors. Basically, this movie masters thrown-in humour very difficult thing to do. As I mentioned, the basis of the movie combines Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer.The characters are made fun of in truly hilarious ways and some characters are redone to be more funny. In Scream, David Arquette is a rookie cop, and his other in is a retarded officer named Doofy. They really did an excellent job of bending his character. Then there's Shawn Wayans who plays a seemingly gay character who is so funny. There were no hints of homosexuality of the other movies, but Shawn works well. In fact, each of our main characters are well-developed and hilarious.The movie works on so many levels, mainly the comedy. I laugh so hard every time I watch this. This pushed the boundaries for R-rated comedies. Since Scary Movie's release in 2000, every teen comedy tries to emulate this with most fail and none coming close.

Tolkien came up with most of his ideas for the Lord Of The Rings series, which is why he said many fans just don't seem to understand the series. In fact, upon reading his journal, one can clearly see that most of his material was a retelling of Norse, Finnish, and some Celtic and Anglo-Saxon legends. He does an excellent job here of taking these many mythologies and stringing them together so seamlessly. Overall, one could say his version seems to insist this was the reality and the legends are just what has lived on of these epic events, which is probably the greatest achievement here as many are introduced to thousands of legends for inspiration and awe without even knowing it. It's a well played sign of respect to the story tellers of the days of old.As for the film itself, it chronicles the first two books in the epic saga, Chronicling the adventures of Frodo Baggins, a hobbit in the shire, and how he learns from Gandalf, an old friend of his uncle Bilbo's, that his uncle's ring was forged by an ancient Warlord named Sauron to conquer the world and how he is now ready for resurrection, prompting a fellowship of warriors set to destroy the ring. Overall, I would recommend this to anyone who just loves a sense of the lost and forgotten, as the viewer seems filled with it by the end of this movie which displays so much of this world. If you are someone looking for inspiration to write a fantasy saga of your own, look no further than this epic retelling of many different legends. Overall, The Lord Of The Rings will be remembered as one of the greatest preservation of legend in history, which is by far it's greatest achievement.

Then again, it was release at my birth year. All the teen movies where we see all those social classes like the jocks, the nerds, the goths, the band-mates and the popular girls, all get first exposed in this movie. But maybe the audience nowadays will find many of the words and idioms used rather strange. Saying sporto instead of jock and saying dweeb instead of nerd sounds very far off even though the audience will catch the meaning quickly via the context. The movie also has real nice and natural flow portraying high school teens where they can be shouting in conflict in one time and be in discussion in a civil way the next few minutes later. The acting overall is kind of a mixed point. Emilio Estevez did well in portraying the cool and determined character while Judd Nelson did well in grabbing all the attention for his character. Molly Ringwald, Ally Sheedy and Anthony Michael Hall did also well in portraying the stereotypes of they respective characters.

The plot's about an orphaned boy named Kim (Dean Stockwell) in colonial India who aids the British in putting down a native rebellion instigated by Russia. It's a colorful and sometimes fun adventure flick with a good performance from Stockwell and fine work from Paul Lukas (looking almost unrecognizable without his mustache) as a Buddhist lama. Errol Flynn's better days were behind him and it's painfully apparent in every scene of his. He looks paunchy and tired throughout and that dyed orange hair and goatee does nothing to help. Still, there are these moments where you see some of that roguish charm and can't help but smile. The movie was filmed mostly on location in India, which helps by providing some lovely scenery. I didn't mind the parts filmed on set, though, as the production values here are of typically excellent quality you would expect from Metro. It goes on a little long and is never as exciting as you would hope but it is enjoyable, particularly for fans of Stockwell or Flynn completists.

Admitted that some of its strategic points too look very flawed at times, but that in my opinion still remains a thing worthy of praise. The scenes where they wait on for hours for each other with the gun, the traps that they set for each other and the way one escapes from another by inches, all of it make for an intriguing battle. Although not perfectly implemented, but I salute the film- maker for having come up with the idea of such a unique war film that is not after all not only about slaughtering.Ed Harris' mere presence as Major Erwin König stole the show. He looked quite suited to the role and was brilliant in his performance. Although Vasily Zaytsev does mention of a German major by this name having had a duel with him, it is a shame that no German record of its military show any evidence of any such major having ever existed.
