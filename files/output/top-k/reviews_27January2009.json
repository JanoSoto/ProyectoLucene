One thing that really annoys me is that some people pretend that they know a lot about movies, but actually they don't have their opinion. Only because it's not that well known post-apocalyptic action film, made on low budged doesn't mean that it's bad. Of course, I'm not blaming those people that they didn't like this movie, but at least if they decided to write a comment on IMDb about it, they should properly explain why. Some people say that the acting was bad. I don't think so. I'm not saying that the acting was worth Oscar, but it really wasn't bad, if you think that acting was bad, then you don't know what the bad acting is. Jean-Claude Van Damme's acting was really good, especially when his character was angry, you could feel his rage. Vincent Klyn did such a great job, his character (Fender Tremolo) used to scare me so much that if I met Fender in real life, I would probably get a heart attack, I've seen Vinsent Klyn in other movies and I liked them so much, but this one still is the best. Other actors were good too, I ain't going to write about them all, but they really did a great job. Some people dare to criticize the direction of this film. The direction was perfect, Albert Pyun did a great job. There was a really creepy atmosphere in this film, all the action scenes looked great and all this thanks to Albert Pyun. My English is pretty bad, so it's hard for me to explain why I liked the direction so much, so I just say that Albert Pyun is one of my favorite directors and I'm so thankful to him for directing this movie. The action was great too. All the fighting scenes were fun to watch, though it was not typical for Jean-Claude Van Damme's films, because this time he often used knifes and swords, but it looked so realistic and effective on screen. All the action sequences were filmed so well that, this movie beets most of that time American martial arts movies. The story was great, some people compare this film (and many other post-apocalyptic films) with Mad Max, but let me remind you, that Mad Max wasn't the first post-apocalyptic film. Actually the story was quite original and creepy, like that scene where Jean-Claude Van Damme's character was crucified. What else did I liked was the costuming and decorations, which were much better than in most of the post-apocalyptic movies and of course the music which created that creepy atmosphere.

Well, the little girl's very cute, indeed, but the story, from my point of view, is far from being that beautiful.First off, the trouble she gets involved is all her fault. She just doesn't follow her mother's advices\/orders like passing by a dangerous place or talking with strangers. Second, all she can do is cry and wait for others to solve the problem she caused by herself. Third, she's not capable of saying at least a small Thank you when everything becomes fine for her. Is this beautiful? I don't think so.Alright, you can say that she's so young and innocence is all she's got, so let's give her a little chance here. Now, what can you tell me about her brother? It's very obvious that he's a way more clever and, let's say it this way, more experienced than the little girl. He's always concerned about her little sister's well-being and that's great, but this is something that most of the brothers around the world do, so there's no need to say that his actions are beautiful. And on the other hand, the way he treats the Afghani kid is not kind at all. First, by rudely taking his stick and then (here I go again), by not saying a little Thank you to him even when the Afghani kid bought with his own money the chewing gum and then let the Iranian ones use his stick, just to help the little girl... All the Afghani kid gets is loneliness when the new year comes... is this beautiful?I clearly understand that the movie is a big metaphor about trying to help each other and being able to show gratitude. And I stick myself to this meaning for the movie didn't leave me a beautiful feeling for one way or another, the grown-ups tried to help the little girl in their very own way, so there's not such an adult indifference here. But when another kid really helps them out, all he gets is the indifference that most of the viewers thought the sister and brother were suffering.Anyway, and now talking about the movie in a general way, I think that the Director could save at least 20 minutes of film by avoiding some long and useless scenes. For example, the one where the kid brings soap instead of shampoo; all the repetitive dialogues the little girls has as well as the long and boring one when the old man explains to his friends why he was arguing with a client. This extra-material makes the movie a little bit slow and, sometimes, boring. That's why I give this 7 out of ten stars.

I'm sorry I missed this when it was fresh in the theaters because it destroyed my bias that it would be one of the obvious tear jerkers and predictable.Thanks to the writing and directing it was far from predictable nor was it obvious.Sean Penn is one of America's classic actors in that he can play just about any role and kill it. Having had a sister who was mentally challenged, he got that part so dead on I was thinking all his character needed to do was hate doctors and it would be my sister up on the screen.The film takes on two powerful topics - mainstreaming mentally challenged adults and child well-being.In the not too distant history people like Sam would have lived their entire lives in an institution. They would live with insane and other people with different mental disorders. Normal people use to not want them around and would warehouse them out of sight out of mind. Adults that live in the community now are functional but don't comprehend or understand complex ideas that we all take for granted. They don't hide or moderate their feelings.Today the government takes a more active role in protecting children. Some say they get too aggressive but in my view I would rather they make a mistake in a effort to help a child than the other way. Dealing with a mentally challenged parent has to be one of the most difficult things to handle when it comes to child protection.This film does a good job of meshing the two topics without giving either short shrift.Through a series of unfortunate events Sam loses custody of his daughter Lucy. He gets a high power lawyer Rita (played by the excellent Michelle Pfeiffer) to take his case pro-bono, mainly because her co-workers think she would never do pro-bono work. While preparing the case Rita learns first to care about Sam and his case and put her heart into it while also learning about why she was having issues with her own life and her relationship with her son Willy.I said the film was unpredictable and the best example was a scene during a court hearing when Sam is being questioned on the stand. Mr. Turner (played by Richard Schiff) asks Sam what does it take to make a good parent. Sam thinks really hard and starts to give a long speech that seems so lucid and intelligent compared to his previous answers. The people in the room are stunned because the answer is so perfect then we find out he quoted a scene from the movie Kramer vs Kramer. Then the look on the faces in the court room said NOOOOOOOOOOO! The ending of the film, while plosive, is left open to interpretation which I also liked.The only quibble I had with the film was that Sam, being mentally challenged and obviously not understanding what was happening to him, was never given any help or an advocate. One example was when he had to see a state appointed psychologist and she explains to him at the start that since she was appointed by the court that he was waving his patient doctor privilege rights. She asks him more than once if he understood and he said he did but there is no way he knew what he was doing. There should have been an advocate there since Rita wasn't there to look out for his rights. Of course that could've been the point - that Sam was being held to the same standards as a intellectually adult person even if it didn't seem fair to Sam.Still this is a great movie and I'm glad I watched it.

Having had a sister who was mentally challenged, he got that part so dead on I was thinking all his character needed to do was hate doctors and it would be my sister up on the screen.The film takes on two powerful topics - mainstreaming mentally challenged adults and child well-being.In the not too distant history people like Sam would have lived their entire lives in an institution. They would live with insane and other people with different mental disorders. Normal people use to not want them around and would warehouse them out of sight out of mind. Adults that live in the community now are functional but don't comprehend or understand complex ideas that we all take for granted. They don't hide or moderate their feelings.Today the government takes a more active role in protecting children. Some say they get too aggressive but in my view I would rather they make a mistake in a effort to help a child than the other way. Dealing with a mentally challenged parent has to be one of the most difficult things to handle when it comes to child protection.This film does a good job of meshing the two topics without giving either short shrift.Through a series of unfortunate events Sam loses custody of his daughter Lucy. He gets a high power lawyer Rita (played by the excellent Michelle Pfeiffer) to take his case pro-bono, mainly because her co-workers think she would never do pro-bono work. While preparing the case Rita learns first to care about Sam and his case and put her heart into it while also learning about why she was having issues with her own life and her relationship with her son Willy.I said the film was unpredictable and the best example was a scene during a court hearing when Sam is being questioned on the stand. Mr. Turner (played by Richard Schiff) asks Sam what does it take to make a good parent. Sam thinks really hard and starts to give a long speech that seems so lucid and intelligent compared to his previous answers. The people in the room are stunned because the answer is so perfect then we find out he quoted a scene from the movie Kramer vs Kramer. Then the look on the faces in the court room said NOOOOOOOOOOO! The ending of the film, while plosive, is left open to interpretation which I also liked.The only quibble I had with the film was that Sam, being mentally challenged and obviously not understanding what was happening to him, was never given any help or an advocate. One example was when he had to see a state appointed psychologist and she explains to him at the start that since she was appointed by the court that he was waving his patient doctor privilege rights. She asks him more than once if he understood and he said he did but there is no way he knew what he was doing. There should have been an advocate there since Rita wasn't there to look out for his rights. Of course that could've been the point - that Sam was being held to the same standards as a intellectually adult person even if it didn't seem fair to Sam.Still this is a great movie and I'm glad I watched it.

How to Beat the High Cost of Living is a 1980 comedy film, starring Jane Curtin, Susan Saint James, and Jessica Lange. Also in the cast are Dabney Coleman, Fred Willard, Richard Benjamin, Eddie Albert, Cathryn Damon, and a cameo by Jane Curtin's fellow Saturday Night Live co-star Garrett Morris.SUMMARY Jane (Susan Saint James), Elaine (Jane Curtin), and Louise (Jessica Lange) are three suburbanites in Eugene, Oregon. These three women have been friends since high school, and are currently all struggling through the recession of the early 1980s. Jane is divorced, trying to cope with the man she is dating, Robert (Fred Willard), her newly-single father (Eddie Albert) who has just moved in with her after his wife leaves him for another woman, and her two young children, one boy and his younger sister whom needs dental work. At the same time as Robert needs thousands to buy his half of a business, Jane learns she is pregnant, which leaves neither of them very happy since both are near broke. Elaine's husband, an architect, has recently left her for a younger woman. He has also left her with no money, no credit cards, and many bills, all of which are very overdue (leading later to a scene with a man at the power company (Garrett Morris). She decides the best way to deal with this surprise situation by getting drunk and going for a drive, where she's caught by police officer Jack (Dabney Coleman). Due to the attraction, they both feel for one another, he lets her poor judgment slide. She finds that even a garage sale, in which she tries to sell everything her husband owned - including his deodorant - doesn't bring in any money. Louise owns and operates an antiques store; unfortunately, it's not a very successful operation, and she is always accepting funds from her veterinarian husband (Richard Benjamin) to keep the store open. While they are in bed one evening, in the early process of making love, she learns he plans to sue her to force her into bankruptcy and thereby wipe away the enormous debt she has incurred. At the peak of their woes, Elaine visits the local mall, where an acquaintance (Cathryn Damon) has pushed her into helping out with lighting a small pageant being held there. Making a phone call, she stares at the large, clear ball in the middle of the mall, which is soon due to hold thousands and thousands of dollars in giant cash give away and suddenly formulates the idea of stealing the money so the three of them can all get the money they need. She calls them to the mall, where they scheme to steal the money during the give away by drilling a hole beneath the cash ball and sucking out as much cash as possible with a high-powered vacuum, then escaping to the river behind the mall. Despite being caught in the act of stealing, some of the items needed for the heist by officer Jack, Elaine once again manages to sweet-talk their way out of being taken to prison. Later, on the evening of the heist, each of them finds an unexpected distraction but finally find their way to the mall, where Jane and Louise begin their work beneath the cash ball, and Elaine readies herself to throw the switch to the mall's light controls (which would give them all enough time to finish the job and escape unnoticed). Unfortunately, a minor occurrence takes place during both the giveaway and the pageant, nearly causing the police to notice the noise caused by Jane and Louise stealing the money. With no other way to distract the police, and the audience present, Elaine begins to rant about the high cost of living and how so many things cost the shirt off your back - and even THAT'S not enough! Very soon, she starts an impromptu striptease and ends with exposing her bosom to the crowd, effectively taking the attention away from what's REALLY going on. Shortly thereafter, one of the indoor light poles falls directly into the ball, sending cash flowing out into the mall, driving people into frenzy as they dive to collect the cash. Noticing the uproar going on above, Jane and Louise make their escape with two large trash bags filled with dollar bills, only to have their canoe tip over when Louise stands up.QUESTIONS When the money fell into the river what Jane have to do? Why were both Jane and Louise sitting on the riverbank? Why did Elaine have a blanket with her? What went floating down the river that caught the three girls' attention? Why did Jane marry Robert ? Why did Louise reopen her? MY THOUGHTS I love this movie because it caught my attention through the entire picture. I give Jane Curtin 6 stars because she wasn't bad in her movie debut. I thought that Jessica Lange was even better in her role as the doctor's wife. However, I bought this movie for two reasons. The first was Susan Saint James who looked great in jeans and everything else she wore. The second reason, Sybil Danning who was Albert receptionist and was excellent at it. Because of those two reasons, I give this movie 10 weasel stars.

Out of pure curiosity, I looked him up on Youtube because I realized that I had never seen a single interview of him, and the first thing I find is an interview where he says, I was born clairvoyant, I was born a healer, and I was born very different. He then goes on to claim that he, along with everyone else who shares his beliefs, is God, and then he apologized for any pain or suffering that he has ever caused any sentient being. Unbelievable! I don't know this guy at all!Anyway, Above the Law is totally different from how I remember it. I mostly remember Out For Justice, which remains my favorite Seagal film but which I hadn't seen for about 15 years until yesterday. In watching Above the Law again, I was struck by how gritty and poorly made it is.It starts out almost like an autobiography of Seagal. He tells his own story, about how he studied Aikido in Japan and soon found himself studying with the masters, but then he gets drafted by the CIA to go to Vietnam and all ties with reality suddenly end.Not that there's anything wrong with that. Seagal is a powerful action star, and the film moves along at a fast clip as he is brought to Vietnam and almost immediately begins lashing out at military corruption as he sees a group of superiors mistreating prisoners. He is promptly booted from the military and becomes a cop in his hometown of Chicago. We jump to years later, he's married and has a kid and a comfortable life as a police officer, but it seems that he never lost the bad taste in his mouth after seeing those officers interrogating an Vietnamese prisoner about drugs. Soon learns of a pretty major smuggling operation involving drugs and plastic explosives.As he investigates deeper and deeper he discovers an intricate plot to assassinate a senator. And when I say intricate, I mean far more involved than the rest of the movie is able to carry. The movie is slow-moving and confusing, and the action is sloppy and careless. Nico, for example, at one point is on the roof of a moving car being fired at by two bad guys inside the car, neither of whom can manage to hit him even though he's less than a foot away from their heads. Makes me wish I was a bad guy in an old Seagal movie! There is, of course, not an ounce of subtlety in the movie. I especially love the characterization. There is one scene where Nico is driving his car and he stops for some schoolkids to cross the road, waving and smiling to him as they do. Seconds later, the bad guys jump out of a nearby van and shove the kids out of the way and start shooting. Real deep character development there, guys!Ultimately the movie makes a comment (which is spoon-fed to us as the end credits start to roll, by the way) about how as long as we have people who can escape investigation we'll always have people who are above the law. That strikes me as a little self-explanatory, but I can understand the message about the corruption of people in the CIA (or any other government institution) being who feel that they can do whatever they want and never have to answer for it.

I mostly remember Out For Justice, which remains my favorite Seagal film but which I hadn't seen for about 15 years until yesterday. In watching Above the Law again, I was struck by how gritty and poorly made it is.It starts out almost like an autobiography of Seagal. He tells his own story, about how he studied Aikido in Japan and soon found himself studying with the masters, but then he gets drafted by the CIA to go to Vietnam and all ties with reality suddenly end.Not that there's anything wrong with that. Seagal is a powerful action star, and the film moves along at a fast clip as he is brought to Vietnam and almost immediately begins lashing out at military corruption as he sees a group of superiors mistreating prisoners. He is promptly booted from the military and becomes a cop in his hometown of Chicago. We jump to years later, he's married and has a kid and a comfortable life as a police officer, but it seems that he never lost the bad taste in his mouth after seeing those officers interrogating an Vietnamese prisoner about drugs. Soon learns of a pretty major smuggling operation involving drugs and plastic explosives.As he investigates deeper and deeper he discovers an intricate plot to assassinate a senator. And when I say intricate, I mean far more involved than the rest of the movie is able to carry. The movie is slow-moving and confusing, and the action is sloppy and careless. Nico, for example, at one point is on the roof of a moving car being fired at by two bad guys inside the car, neither of whom can manage to hit him even though he's less than a foot away from their heads. Makes me wish I was a bad guy in an old Seagal movie! There is, of course, not an ounce of subtlety in the movie. I especially love the characterization. There is one scene where Nico is driving his car and he stops for some schoolkids to cross the road, waving and smiling to him as they do. Seconds later, the bad guys jump out of a nearby van and shove the kids out of the way and start shooting. Real deep character development there, guys!Ultimately the movie makes a comment (which is spoon-fed to us as the end credits start to roll, by the way) about how as long as we have people who can escape investigation we'll always have people who are above the law. That strikes me as a little self-explanatory, but I can understand the message about the corruption of people in the CIA (or any other government institution) being who feel that they can do whatever they want and never have to answer for it.

Out of pure curiosity, I looked him up on Youtube because I realized that I had never seen a single interview of him, and the first thing I find is an interview where he says, I was born clairvoyant, I was born a healer, and I was born very different.

Modern horror movies are just gory, not scary. The old movies, boy, now those were scary because you didn't always see the monster. If you want scary go watch . . . And they always finish their statement with whichever popular 70s horror film they first watched in their pre-teens and peed their pants over. To them, there could never be anything scarier because that movie is so ground into their psyche. To the modern viewer, there could never be anything funnier because we've matured and realized the real world is infinitely more terrifying than creaky staircases. I view old horror movies in the same way I view cartoons. They're so over-the-top and ridicules that it's impossible to take them seriously, but they have some entertainment value when you have nothing better to do. There are a handful of exceptions to that last sentence&#151;Alien ('79), The Shining ('80), Black Christmas ('74)&#151;but for the most part, it's a fairly realistic view. While I hoped The Open could have been one of the few exceptions, it isn't. Doesn't even come close.I have a lot of appreciation for the slow opening that builds emotional impact and atmosphere. However, it seems that I can count the films that actually pulled off that style without just adding pointless scenes for the sake of pointless scenes on one hand. In The Omen, the slow build not only adds a lot of pointless scenes&#151;running animals, OH MY!&#151;but it makes the viewer fail to see the difference between this and a Lifetime move. The slow build never once emphasizes the imminent doom hanging over the family's heads; it just pumps the movie full of boredom and cheese. Unless you're frightened by running animals and a kid riding his tricycle, there is nothing subtly frightening here. And the slow build takes up 3\/4ths of the entire movie. I'll give The Omen credit for having one well-done abrupt moment of shock near the beginning, but after that it goes back to cliché drama. Horror directors\/writers have a false idea that if they immerse you in the daily life of the characters, you'll care about them when they're killed or are nearly killed. The reason that is untrue is because all the characters in The Omen are all flat clichés. Who would have guessed the husband doesn't believe in the supernatural, then by the end is converted into believing the absurd storyline? Who would have guessed the wife is a spineless women who just whines and acts dumb in every scene she has? Drama doesn't build an attachment to characters. It didn't in 1970, it doesn't today. What builds an emotional attachment to characters is characters that actually have CHARACTER. Characters that actually have a personality and aren't just walking horror clichés with legs.The other problem with The Omen is the absurdity of it all. A man's adopted son is really the antichrist&#151;that I can take seriously. Everyone associated with the antichrist is marked with sacrilegious symbols and must be contended with in religious ways&#151;that's just stupid. Being someone with a theological background, the stupidity of religious horror movies always makes me laugh. Instead of actually following scripture and creating a genuinely terrifying experience, there always has to be retarded gobbledygook thrown in to cheese everything up. Instead of accurately portraying a realistic Christian or non-Christian, every last person in these religious horror films have to be a religious extremist of a die-hard atheist. There is just no realism. People site The Omen as one of the movies that subtly frightens you to the point of terror, but that simply isn't true. The Omen bashes you over the head with cheesy, over-the-top Hollywood conventions. I find it ironic modern horror films bash you with gore and it's not scary; older horror films bash you with cheese and it's REALLY not scary. When I wasn't bored, I was laughing.The Omen isn't a perfectly terrible movie, though. The directing is solid. The slow-mo close-ups of predictable plot points, however, got really stupid really fast. The acting from everyone but the wife is very solid. The wife is possibly the most over-the-top whiney female in any 70s horror film, period. The entire movie carries a very classic feel that most 70s horror movies carry, and that adds some entertainment value. The actual story, if they were to have taken out the gobbledygook, is fairly solid and interesting, even if it isn't anything new or original. And that's all the good I can say.As I said, I appreciate a lot of what made parts of The Omen a solid movie and gained it its classic status. That doesn't mean I can take it seriously, because I can't. It's too ridiculous and pumped with too much cheese. When I think of true terror, I most often think of something realistic. People say torture porn and gore isn't scary, but it hits far more raw nerves with me and other horror fans because it's something that could really happen. It's not campy or fun. It's real. It's disturbing. Isn't that what true horror is supposed to be? That doesn't mean I hate old horror movies. Straw Dogs ('71) was the forerunner for Saw ('04). Just because something's old doesn't mean it's good, and just because something's new doesn't mean it's bad. And vice versa. But it's impossible for me to give a high score to The Omen.

So I strongly recommend this picture, certainly after this I would like to see my second Michael Winterbottom film, I think I will start by giving a chance to the 2004 film 9 Songs. 9.5 out of 10PD curious for me that posters of my two favourites bands of all time (The Doors and Pink Floyd) can be seen in this film. First is the poster of The Dark Side of the Moon, it is remove by one of Tony's friends after seeing the Sex Pistols live. Later we can see a Jim Morrison poster in Ian Curtis' house. DVD special features Manchester the movie, About Tony Wilson, deleted scenes, commentary with Tony Wilson, commentary with Steve Coogan and Andrew Easton (producer), trailer and photo gallery.

Yes and No. The 1st Hour is a Joy,you can slowly start to see things unraveling,Bilbo's character change,you start to see Gandalf become more and more paranoid,I was on the edge of my seat,wondering what was gonna happen next. Unfourtantley,the 2nd half stumbled a bit for me,I was bored in some scenes,Morgoth Vs Gandalf was highly disappointing in my opinion. The fight itself was interesting,Ian McKellen had some excellent dialog,but it just seemed blah to me,they did it perfectly at the end,with Ian Mckellen yelling Fly You Fools!. but in my opinion Elijah Wood,ruined it with his totally OTT overacting,after Gandalf's death. The sequels improve amazingly better after this one,to me it's the weak link,Now you might think from reading this from all the criticism,that I disliked the film,but when in fact I really quite liked it, There's a lot more good that outweigh's the bad,the effects are breathtaking,the battle scenes near the end are exhilarating,it's more exciting then boring more often then not and Peter Jackson does a wonderful job of directing,the only thing that was off was the pacing,and it lacked humor,other then that I loved it. The Acting for the most part is truly excellent. Elijah Wood is On and Off. at times he's very convincing and likable,others he overacts completely and is dull as a doorknob,he is supposed to be the main focus of the film,he has a burden with the ring,and was very inconsistent in my opinion,however he improves greatly in the sequels. Ian McKellen is brilliant as Gandalf,he's funny,and has all the great lines,but is intense when needed,which is a lot of the time in the 2nd half,he steals the film if you ask me.Sean Astin annoys me most of the time,but he plays the best friend of Frodo really well,he's likable and does his job well,liked him a lot.Sean Bean is awesome as Boromir,he was unpredictable,and you could feel the Ring could change him at any moment,it was a shame his character never continued,but It lead to a good storyline in the sequels.Orlando Bloom is pretty cool as Legolas the Elve his Arrow work was a sight to behold and didn't have a whole lot to do,but when he was on screen he did it well.Cate Blanchett is OK,she's barely on screen and I found her scene to be pretty pointless,even though it served the film with a purpose.Billy Boyd&Dominic Monaghan Do well as the comic relief Duo,providing some good laughs for the viewer,and thankfully never got too annoying.Christopher Lee is as always a great presence,and is wonderful as Saruman,he is often creepy and gave me a fright,whenever he was on screen he gave me chills,and some of his scenes with McKellen were a sight to behold!.Ian Holm is Pretty good as Bilbo he's likable and on top of things,but after the 1st half you don't see him again till well ahead in the 2nd half. Viggo Mortensen Is good for the most part,His scene where he is 1st revealed is quite a memorable moment,but at times he felt rather wooden,but for the most part I was impressed,especially with his Sword fighting skills. John Rhys-Davies is comic relief and not very good one at that,his character wasn't needed.Liv Tyler is a Gorgeous woman no doubt but she felt off and was somewhat wooden.Hugo Weaving is alright but nothing more then that,her scenes with Liv Tyler felt forced.This film is an epic blockbuster,that is a Required viewing for everyone,It's an exciting experience,it might be the weak link by far in my opinion but it's still a fine way to get into this Magical series!

And Betsy Blair, as Marty's love interest, Clara, was wonderful too. (On a side note, I found out from watching this on TCM that she was married to Gene Kelly at the time this movie was made).In a way, Marty is a kind of anti-romance.

Having seen both many years ago, it was also fun to revisit two movies that revolutionised the CG animated genre and gave rise to the likes of Shrek, Ice Age as well as the rest of Pixar's extraordinary back catalogue. For that, kids of all ages will be forever thankful to Woody, Buzz, Rex, Slinky and the rest. But what I can't figure out is which is better - the wonderful original or the bigger, brighter and more entertaining sequel?For Toy Story 2, we return to Andy's room where Woody (voiced by Tom Hanks) and Buzz (Tim Allen) have patched things up and get on famously well with the rest of Andy's toys. But after Woody is stolen by a toy collector, Buzz and his friends decide to launch a perilous rescue mission across town to recover Woody. However, Woody finds that his destiny may lay with his new friends - prospector Stinky Pete (Kelsey Grammar), Jessie the cow-girl (Joan Cusack) and Bullseye, Woody's horse - known as Woody's Round-Up Gang. Will Buzz and the group ever find Woody and if they do, would he want to go back?In its favour, Toy Story 2 is chock-full of ideas and enthusiasm and like The Incredibles, it shows. It may be heavily reliant on references and in-jokes but they work, making you enjoy the film even more. Hanks and Allen are still a terrific pairing, even if they share less screen time than before. What the film misses is the existential issues that made the first film more than just a family flick - it's hinted at with the second Buzz figure but there isn't really a need to explore it again, I guess. So by focusing on being an all-out action entertainment movie, it really delivers. It's more fun and engaging than before - the song When She Loved Me is surprisingly emotional (prompting the odd tear, I'm not ashamed to say) - and from a technical stand-point, it looks even better than the first film.So which is better? In fairness, that depends on what you want. The difference between both films is slight but still noticeable. It's like comparing Alien and Aliens - same characters but different styles. Toy Story is slower and more simplistic from a technical standpoint but smarter and better written. Toy Story 2 is full of ideas, humour, action and fun but lacks the original's cutting edge and the open-jawed wonder of seeing a CG animated movie for the first time. Personally, I just prefer the sequel which I enjoyed more but really, nothing is gained by separating them. Do what I did and ask for the twin-pack DVD for Christmas then sit back and enjoy two wonderful family movies. Quite how Pixar keep making superb family films that appeal to kids and adults with the ease and frequency that they do is a staggering mystery and thank God they do!
