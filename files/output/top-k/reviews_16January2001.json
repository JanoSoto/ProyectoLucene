You might walk away from it feeling refreshed and pleasantly surprised.Director David Moreton's honest and understated screenplay makes this film a cut above the rest.  It neither succumbs to cliche, nor does it it pander to the audience's expectations.  It also works in the film's favor that it doesn't aim to be a straight-friendly crowd pleaser.  Instead, it is a quieter and no-frills portrayal of what it is like to grow up as a gay teenager.  The sex scenes in Edge of Seventeen are also genuinely erotic and sensitively portrayed.  They are realistic not because they are graphic, but because of the emotional candor that comes from them.Edge of Seventeen is also extremely well-acted by a committed cast of actors, most of whom make their screen-acting debuts here.  Chris Stafford gives one of 1999's best performances as Eric.  What I liked about Eric is that Moreton does not paint him as a hero or a saint, but rather as a vulnerable kid who slowly tries to assert his sexuality, while not always making the right decisions.  It is also very moving to see how he struggles to find acceptance and validation not only from his family and his friend Maggie (played nicely by Tina Holmes) but also from his new gay peers.  The scene where he phones Rod on the pay phone is a good example of this.The ending is another reason why Edge of Seventeen stands out.  Rather than tying everything up in a neat, little resolution, it leaves many questions remaining, many issues left unresolved.  But it is still a satisfying ending because it gives the audience a sense of hope.  It doesn't ignore the fact that our decisions may bring about as many sacrifices as they do rewards.Ironically, I think the uncompromised honesty is the reason why it didn't do as well commercially as movies like Get Real and Beautiful Thing.  Unlike these two films, Edge of Seventeen is a more serious and understated film that doesn't rely on trite gay jokes and sassy fag hags and drag queens to get laughs.  In other words, it achieves its truthfulness by not reducing itself to a crowd pleaser.  Also, while the main character, Eric, is very likeable, he is not without flaw.  I think this makes it easier for a viewer to relate to Eric as he attempts to find self-acceptance and belonging.  For these reasons, Edge of Seventeen beathes life into the gay coming-of-age genre.

I couldn't stop thinking about that question last week while watching 'Snatch.' It seems to be two cups of 'Pulp Fiction' with half a cup of 'Fight Club' mixed in a blender (at high speed!) with a sprinkling of Worcestershire sauce, making some of the British accents hard to digest, but the result is tasty. I enjoyed this movie quite a bit, but would I have liked it even more if I hadn't seen those two other films? Probably. Even having seen them I couldn't help making mental comparisons at most key points. The only real 'Fight Club' similarity is Brad Pitt as a rebel loner covered with carnage while a cigarette dangles from the side of his mouth. He plays a tough street boxer who can drop a guy twice his size with one punch. His incomprehensible jargon has to be heard to be believed. The comparisons to 'Pulp Fiction' are many and it is fun to spot them. So I will let you see what you can find as you watch it for yourself.The story itself is slight, but with all the characters this story juggles it would be harder to follow if there were more plot to deal with. We have a dozen gangsters and a settlement of pikers (squatters, or gypsies, to us Americans) who cross paths over a stolen 86-karat diamond. The bulk of the story is really inconsequential. It is mainly a frame on which to hang the run-ins of a gaggle of bumbling crooks who spout pearls of street wisdom off the cuff whenever they're not killing each other. The film is written and directed by Madonna's new husband, Guy Ritchie, and there is a reference to her music in one line. This is a funny movie that will need attention paid to the characters and the accents. For some it may not be worth all that work. Personally, I will see it again.

The emotions felt by millions on the happenings of a cast of characters every week is very evident in the fan following of the popular show.  So popular, in fact, that it has managed to survive over 30 years in the form of television shows and spin-offs, movies, comics, action figures, lunch boxes, yo-yos, you name it!  And it still lingers on generation after generation... and we aren't even in the 23rd century yet!  People love STAR TREK!  And if you are one of them... if you are a Trekkie, than indeed, TREKKIES is dedicated to you.     This movie isn't just for the fans of that show.  In fact, it is more about the fans and their stories.  Stories that are sometimes more interesting than some of the episodes of the t.v. show they so admire.  Stories like a woman who dresses up in a star trek uniform every day... even when she was a juror in court!  A dentist who decorated his practice into a bridge on any star trek vessel.

Perhaps one of the best things about TREKKIES is the interviews and reactions from the actors who have portrayed characters in the star trek universe.  Everyone from Leonard Nimoy (who played Spock on the original series) to John de Lancie (who played Q on STTNG) documented how STAR TREK has affected their lives... and how their lives have touched the fans.  Stories of laughter, drama and a strange sense of the overall power of this television phenomenon pack their conversations.

They nestle in deep ruts worn into the stone paving blocks of a roadway entering a gated city.  The cart rumbles on, its wheels fitting perfectly into the grooves worn by unspoken centuries of just such passing wagons...in one image we see how tradition creates its own paths, how contemporary reality is fabricated to fit such traditions...  The camera rises, we see an almost impossible panorama of Peking, the Forbidden City spreading out before us like an Oz extending to the horizon.What a film this is  a superb action adventure romance with terrific acting and a much-welcome heart underlying the technical superiority.Crouching Tiger..., I am told, is representative of a specific literary\/cinematic genre in China Wu Xia...the wizard\/warrior piece...magic and martial arts blended.  I'm not familiar with the form, but the world portrayed here is a breathtakingly fantastical one.  The story is putatively set in 19th century China, but it could be anywhere, anywhen.  It is a place of high honor and deep feelings, a place where people are bound by traditions and held captive by their forms.  It is also a place of wild and mythic landscapes...from stark desert (thought nowhere do we get that featureless, wide-screen linear horizon seen in David Lean's Lawrence of Arabia!) to magic misty green mountains with deep dark lakes and steeply cascading streams that come braiding, tumbling down the rockslide heights. High, reedy bamboo forests wave, wondrous, in sighing winds.In this world people may do amazing things.  The flying in this movie -- properly called wire work in film terms -- is fantastic.  This technique, of course, was not invented by the Wachowski's, but the choreographer of Crouching Tiger..., Woo-ping Yuen, also staged the wire-fights of Matrix.  Here, the ability of our warrior heros and villains to climb walls, to leap to the rooftops and soar from building to building -- not to mention engaging each other in aerial combat that soars from the peak of a mountain top to the rocks of a mountain stream in a single take -- or to duel on the very tips of dipping, waving bamboo trees -- looks almost plausible, just over the border of the possible, at least.   The whole packed-in audience at the big theater at the advanced screening at Pipers Alley in Chicago burst into spontaneous applause several times throughout...At other moments, I found myself in weepy transport.  As I think of the fight in the treetops, right now, I become drippy -- tingly of eye and sinus.Apart from all else, this is grand storytelling!  It has passion, love, revenge...it expresses deep need and longing.And, yes, the woman are the action hearts of the film!  Michelle Yeoh is wonderful...but I've been in love with her for years.  Here, she is more mature, quieter, wiser than in any role I've seen her in.  Her performance is strong and moving, her face registering, magically, a range of conflicting emotions, hidden secrets, crouching angers, all at once.  In acting training we were always told you can't do that.

I'm not familiar with the form, but the world portrayed here is a breathtakingly fantastical one.  The story is putatively set in 19th century China, but it could be anywhere, anywhen.  It is a place of high honor and deep feelings, a place where people are bound by traditions and held captive by their forms.  It is also a place of wild and mythic landscapes...from stark desert (thought nowhere do we get that featureless, wide-screen linear horizon seen in David Lean's Lawrence of Arabia!) to magic misty green mountains with deep dark lakes and steeply cascading streams that come braiding, tumbling down the rockslide heights. High, reedy bamboo forests wave, wondrous, in sighing winds.In this world people may do amazing things.  The flying in this movie -- properly called wire work in film terms -- is fantastic.  This technique, of course, was not invented by the Wachowski's, but the choreographer of Crouching Tiger..., Woo-ping Yuen, also staged the wire-fights of Matrix.  Here, the ability of our warrior heros and villains to climb walls, to leap to the rooftops and soar from building to building -- not to mention engaging each other in aerial combat that soars from the peak of a mountain top to the rocks of a mountain stream in a single take -- or to duel on the very tips of dipping, waving bamboo trees -- looks almost plausible, just over the border of the possible, at least.   The whole packed-in audience at the big theater at the advanced screening at Pipers Alley in Chicago burst into spontaneous applause several times throughout...At other moments, I found myself in weepy transport.  As I think of the fight in the treetops, right now, I become drippy -- tingly of eye and sinus.Apart from all else, this is grand storytelling!  It has passion, love, revenge...it expresses deep need and longing.And, yes, the woman are the action hearts of the film!  Michelle Yeoh is wonderful...but I've been in love with her for years.  Here, she is more mature, quieter, wiser than in any role I've seen her in.  Her performance is strong and moving, her face registering, magically, a range of conflicting emotions, hidden secrets, crouching angers, all at once.

Usually when I write about a film I try to avoid revealing much about the movie.  I will deviate from this rule a little for this movie because I hope that all of you are somewhat aware of how the story unfolds. `13 Days' stars Kevin Costner as Kenneth O'Donnell, special assistant to President Kennedy during the crisis.  It is the story of how O'Donnell, JFK, RFK, and others made crucial decisions as missile crisis unfolded. All the actors do an excellent job (although Costner's `Bawstan' accent is distracting at first, I laughed whenever he said `Cuber' which was often) and the pacing and production values are top notch. The plot unfolds on many levels and the tension mounts creating a real life Tom Clancy novel.  The two air combat scenes are fantastic. The film succeeds wonderfully as a piece of entertainment.  It is not too simple and only rarely is melodramatic. In its portrayal of actual events the film is somewhat less successful.  I am no Kennedy fan to say the least and cult that has developed around the whole Kennedy family perplexes me.  I was sure this movie would be nothing more than the next step on the road to JFK's deification.  I was surprised to find it fairly even handed in its treatment of the issues involved.  It presents effectively how serious the actions of the Soviet Union were, the worldwide climate at the time and the lack faith in Kenendy after the Bay of Pigs.  It also shows what a political animal Kennedy was and makes a joke of how in debt he was to Daley (echoes of current events). Like all historical films this one simplifies a great deal and there are many actions attributed incorrectly to Costner's character to make the film work.  Also this movie is another in the long line of films that portray top generals as war hungry dogs that must be kept on a tight leash.  I get sick of military leaders being portrayed as trigger-happy cowboys and the scenes where Costner tells individual pilots to lie to their leaders are just silly.  The film however highlights the importance of a civilian controlled military and it celebrates the soldiers who risked their lives during the crisis.  There are problems with accuracy but this is not work of fiction like `Hurricane' or `The Cradle Will Rock.' This film also raises the issue of faith.  The movie is full of religious images and at one point Costner even prays for peace (showing there are no atheist in foxholes or life rafts).  It seems odd when in the end all the credit is given to `men of goodwill.' Having said all this I believe this is a valuable film.  Any movie that celebrates national service both in the military and in public office cannot be all bad.  Also in the era of revisionist history it is encouraging to see a film that highlights the serious nature of the communist threat at that time.  It has become fashionable to argue that communist world domination was never a possibility. It is also refreshing to see a President willing to draw a line in the sand when the nation is threatened.  While I had some problems with this film it is highly entertaining and any movie that is thrilling while dealing in serious way with such events is quite an achievement in today's Hollywood.

All the wisecracks and zany in-jokes, the fun and adventure will make this one quite a scream for a young audience looking for a good time.I do feel, however, that an older crowd might be put off by it.  Lots of times the jokes come in at very fast paces and are sometimes hard to pick up on at first glance.  The plot also gets choppy in places.  And a lot of the humor is aimed at the younger audience, thought not too young, but the grandparents in the audience might get bored or confused by it.  Parents may find them amusing, but the only people I heard laughing the whole time were the teens to 20's.  You know when you leave the theatre and are still reciting the dialogue and jokes from the movie that you had fun watching it.  And you know the film was good.

My favorite character in the film has to be Darla for those of you that don't know who she is or remember she is Vilmer's girlfriend. I've read many reader reviews for this film & i don't understand why everyone has nothing but bad stuff to say about it. For fan's of the WWF this is a film you should see because WWF Diva Debra Williams-Wife of Stone Cold Steve Austin has a bit role a Police Officer 1... This film very much so has the feel of the first Texas Chainsaw Massacre which is a classic all it's own. 4 friends start out at the Prom where Heather catches her boyfriend Berry with another girl she runs off Barry follows she jumps in his Dad's car as Barry soon does... she puts the petal to the medal then Jenny & her friend Sean sit up from the back seat & a lot of talk goes on. So on Heather takes a short cut down a dirt back road much like other TCM's Heather ends running into another car causing the car to go off the road, after this they all get out of the car and check on the other  uy whoam they hit...he faints! So 3 of the 4 go to look for help leaving Sean to stay with the other guy. Heather, Barry & Jenny find help when they come upon Darla's work place. She call's her boyfriend Vilmer to go out and get the car...The kid's thank Darla for her help and go off on their way back to the car along the way they get lost & Heather & Barry go down a path they see leaving Jenny alone on the road alone...Now back to Sean who is still waiting with the car, Vilmer comes along in his toll truck & comes out and checks on the guy who had fainted Vilmer then goes on to tell Sean that he is dead & then kills him...Vilmer goes on to kill Sean, Heather... Leatherface kill's Barry coming out of the bathroom... Jenny makes it through the film... now i cut that short so you that have not seen it will get a shock from the rest of the film.

Jump scares work for serial killer movies, like Friday the 13th, or Scream.  Jump scares rely heavily on loud glaring sounds when you do not expect them, and objects suddenly popping onto the screen.  When these happen, most people jump, hence the name. These however do not leave you with any feeling of dread, no spine-tingling fear, nothing like that, because as soon as the jump scare is over........thats pretty much all there is.Lately directors seem to be overusing jump scares.  What Lies Beneath comes to mind.  This movie was creepy without all of the jump scares, and yet it was filled with these scares, filled to the point where a second watching of the film is not nearly as scary as the first.Keep that information aside for a bit, and let me tell ya'll about vampire movies.  Vampire movies should NOT rely on jump scares, they should not pretend to be truly scary.  Vampirism is romanticised by novels and films (not to mention all those goth kids) today.  When Lugosi did Dracula, it was considered scary, and still is today (well maybe only to three year olds). Today we have movies like Blade and John Carpenters Vampires which try to monopolize on the fact that vampires are no more scary than any other bad guy in an action film.  Then there are films like Bram Stokers Dracula, which wholeheartedly admit that the vampire subgenre of horror films are little more than eye candy, interesting folklore, and lots of homoerotic (and other erotic) imagery.So my point here  This film took the tired out jump scare routine, and integrated it with an other wise wonderful vampire movie that truly puts a new spin on the dracula legend (although it comes off as sounding too much like all the horrible Y2K movies of recent years like end of days, or Lost souls).  And the result  a cheap schlock fest.There were so many scenes here that were fantastically done though, and I cannot ignore them.  Most notably, Mary's Red Hallway scene and the most beautiful vampire chicks this genre has seen in years.The good scenes do out weigh the bad jump scares, but when you look back on it, there seem to be way too many of these jump scares here, and this is a problem, and will be a problem for anyone who thinks they're going to see a great vampire movie....forget it, this one is closer to Scream than anything else.one final note, it came as a complete shock to me to see Colleen Fitzpatrick, who I knew as Amber from Hairspray, and then to find out she's actually Vitamin C.....but she mastered the role of vampire bride, not that its very difficult to look sexy with fangs and a tight dress.

Susan Sarandon and Julia Roberts give excellent performances as the mother and stepmother of two highly likable kids. Ed Harris's performance is kind of flat, but I blame this more on the script than on his ability as an actor. The story is about how a family reacts to one divorced parent getting remarried, in this case Ed Harris and Julia Roberts move in together and it causes tensions for everyone. Sarandon and the kids start out hating Isobel (Roberts) to the point that Sarandon (I keep forgetting her character's name) doesn't even want Isobel to be alone with the children. The story is very real. I can only imagine how an ex-wife would feel when her husband moves in with another woman. I have personally lived the role of the children. My father got remarried to a beautiful, younger woman when I was growing up and I wasn't particularly thrilled. The children in the movie remain fiercely loyal to their mother and adopt her attitudes about Isobel. At one point the son says to Sarandon something like, I can hate her (Isobel) if you want me to. What makes the movie so real is that while Sarandon and Isobel eventually become civil with one another, they never become best friends. If they had the film would have lost all credibility with me.(SPOILER ALERT, although this plotline is in all the reviews) Sarandon's character has cancer and as the films goes on we begin to understand that Isobel will end of being more than just a STEPmother. While her relationship starts out on a bad note with the kids, (especially the daughter) it's a no-brainer that as the movie goes on she'll win their hearts. But it's the way she wins their hearts that's very believable. It doesn't happen overnight. I did have a problem with Sarandon's bitchiness toward Isobel. She was relentless. In one scene Isobel asks Sarandon if she could take the daughter to a Pearl Jam concert on a school night, as a way to try and get closer to her. Sarandon says no. A few scenes later Sarandon whips out tickets to the concert right in front of Isobel and snottily says to her, Thanks. It was a great idea. This kind of thing, while believable, didn't endear me to Sarandon, and at that point in the film if was time for her to change her attitude.All five actors give excellent performances and as I said, the plot is very believable. This film has everything comedy, drama, romance, family values. I highly recommend it to anyone, but it will really hit home with people who've lived through a similar situations.

The younger generation is basically taught that the sorts of profound questions that Bergman asks (and Bergman more than any other auteur, for even the most highly respected auteurs, Truffaut, Fellini, Kurosawa, Kubrick, shied away from subjects such as Bergman has tackled) are unnecessary. They are taught this because, if they were to willingly examine the emptiness of human existence, they would quickly fail to participate in all the lovely shadows on the cave wall, and then society would go kaput.Truthfully, I have not seen all that many Ingmar Bergman films. This shocked me, too, as I realized this. Before I came to college, I rented his most famous film, The Seventh Seal. Even the uneducated realize upon seeing it that it is one of the best films ever made. Next, probably the next week after I saw The Seventh Seal, I rented his second most famous film Wild Strawberries. At the time, I did not find it all that interesting. It has been four years since I saw it, and I know I should rent it again, but I remember that I was sure that I understood it when it was over, and that its profundity was slight in comparison with The Seventh Seal. Like I said, I need to see it again. It was some three years later that I saw another Bergman film, Through the Glass Darkly. I was stunned at it, as I was at The Seventh Seal, even if slightly less. And then I saw maybe the greatest film that I ever saw, and it was one of his Persona, the film that has haunted me for months now.And now comes my fifth Bergman experience Cries and Whispers. At first, I found it sort of slow, but that did not last for long. Without even realizing it, at about the half-hour point, I was so drawn in that I was experiencing the same pain as was being experienced by the four main characters onscreen. This is a devastating film. Its silence hurts terribly. And sometimes subtle sound effects scrape across your skin like a fork the clock especially. Also, the whispers, which turn up as the film has faded out and is fading back in. I know for a fact that Criterion is doing a DVD version of this film, and that is great. On a VHS tape, the static is so loud as to drown out the subtleties on the soundtrack. And then there are the cries, which made me want to cry aloud along with the characters. All in all, my understanding of this completely exhilarating and painful film are weak. But in this lies the greatness of such a film that challenges my intellect. I must think hard about this, reading up on it, and hopefully seeing it again. I do not at all mind having to do this. It is much better than the escapism of an everyday film.And if you are reading this comment because you love this movie, may I suggest Woody Allen's Hannah and Her Sisters, which was obviously inspired by this film. It is not as great, for it is lighter, but it is a worthwhile followup to the film. Also, William Faulkner's novel As I Lay Dying, which has a somewhat similar plot.

Later on our heroine is in a car with one of the bad guys and finally tells him and the world that she's mad as hell and she's not going to take it anymore. Well, not really MAD as such, that would mean getting excited. So she gives us the impression that she's only left her mascara behind kind of upset. Not even being an international fugitive un-settles our sterling gal. Seeing her face on an all points bulletin makes her take extra special precautions. Donning a disguise, like a wig or doing up her hair, perhaps? A hat or a scarf, maybe? At the very least dark glasses? No, our heroine has outsmarted police officers, professional hitmen and a ruthless and sinister cyber crime syndicate so what does she do? She goes out on the streets in broad daylight as  herself. They'd never see that one coming. Will nothing phase our heroine? I guess the only chance of a genuine reaction of anxiety and deep distress from our intrepid geek would come only if the part of her mother had been given to actress Rita Tushingham.
