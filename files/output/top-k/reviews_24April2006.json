I suppose I was expecting either some suspense, or something of mythic lameness (coined a new phrase there...you just watch!). Instead, I found something very strange.First off, I have to say that Dracula 2000 is not in any way frightening, not even for a moment. I'm a terrible chicken when it comes to horror films that I can hardly stand watching many of them, but this movie never even made me think about flinching. In the commentary they go on about things being scares, but they're really just...not. I don't know what the deal is with that. You'd think they could at least surprise you into being startled, but no.For all that, though, Dracula 2000 is oddly alluring, not least because of Dracula himself. Yes, he is gorgeous. No, I will not gush. I would say that Mr. Butler plays Dracula as very mysterious and scary, but he really mostly looks bemused in many scenes. Who can blame him, though? The character has missed a century, and here he is in the middle of Mardi Gras.The actors did a good job with what they had, and the dialog isn't bad. The action was as well-done as could be expected given time and budget restraints, though as with all effects using cables to make people fly around there were moments when it didn't really work. The bit where Spunkula (sorry...Dracula...) turns into a wolf is rendered just plain silly by the way it's done. With the rest of the film filled with all sorts of effects shots, to have that one transformation done by cutting back and forth between Gerard Butler and a wolf really fast is distractingly campy. It really doesn't help that the wolf they got looks old and confused, either.Dracula's new back story was creative, to say the least. It did add a dimension to the film without which it would have been just too inane. I'm not going to go into terribly much detail there, since I'm sure it's already been discussed to death.My suggestion to you is to stop viewing this as a horror film and re-watch it, thinking of it this time as a comedy. While it's true that if this had been their aim they ought to have upped the camp just a bit more and left in a lot of the scenes you'll find in the extras on the DVD, it's still enjoyable in this fashion. When that blood splatters across the inside of the plane, go ahead and laugh. It's cheesy. It's silly. It's great fun.Ah, and keep your ears open in the scene in which Van Helsing is mucking about with the leeches. The music he puts on the record player is the fourth movement of Hector Berlioz's Symphonie Fantastique, March to the Scaffold, though the first few seconds are skipped.

In this world of the military medical sidelines, where soldiers get the help they need after battle, the camaraderie is never too false, and the cast assembled is the first prime example of Altman's policy of casting being 80% of the job. The film is put together in a piece-meal kind of way, with about as loose a plot as dialog construction, where the sense of humor from the main male characters (i.e. Elliot Gould and Donald Sutherland) is the kind of juvenile, sarcastic humor associated with its time. This is likely the kind of film that John Landis must have seen at least a few times before making Animal House.But the problem for me, aside from the film's strength in breaking conventions and having such a varied cast (Sally Kellerman and Robert Duvall in the same movie, not to mention Tom Skerritt and Bud Cort), is in it working as a comedy. As a comedy in and of itself its just, well, alright. The humor and jokes in the film are a big step above the television show's lot that followed in the 70's (then again, I'm not a fan of the show anyway), but the attitudes of the characters, and the little understated bits that happen, miss marks of satire I would've liked to have seen. There's some of the human comedy that Altman's obviously been influenced by Renoir to showcase, yet I wasn't laughing at it as much as paying attention to what the conversations were going on. It's a kind of high-brow\/low-brow concoction that has its moments, and then does not at the same time. Perhaps I was expecting a little more than I ended up getting from the Golden Palm winneing, smash-hit film that jump-started the prolific director's career. And it is a good movie, no argument about that, it's got fun and shenanigans and a winning cast, and it has been created and performed enough skill and enjoyment that marks as important for all the actors involved.

He plays Paul Beigler, a small-town lawyer who defends a man on a charge that he murdered a man whom his wife accused of having raped her. Stewart leaves his stutter and naively cheerful personality behind to create a believable character who is to be taken seriously, although we wind up knowing very little about him personally. Lee Remick plays Laura Manion, the woman making the rape charge. Laura is more than a bit of a flirt and, even though that is essential to the story, she seems to overplay it. That she should come on to Beigler, a man a generation older and the defense lawyer for her husband, I found incongruous. It is good to see a young George C. Scott turn in an Oscar-nominated performance as one of the prosecuting attorneys. And Joseph N. Welch, who plays the judge, is one of the highlights.There is a subplot concerning Paul and his older lawyer friend Parnell Emmett McCarthy (Arthur O'Connell). Parnell seems to have a lot of regrets about his career and sees Beigler as a representation of what he was before he took some wrong turns, one such being a turn toward drink. But Paul induces Parnell to become involved with the case and Parnell is transformed by being wanted and being able to contribute. I found this little commentary on how important it is to be valued to be moving and true.The movie is long, playing to 160 minutes, but the leisurely pacing is one of its good points. We get to know the personalities of the characters well and get much background information about the case before the extended courtroom battle. The black and white photography is some of the best and well deserving of its Oscar nomination. There are some great nighttime shots with the lighting just perfect. I suppose the detailed discussion of the rape was sensational at the time, but that aspect of the film will be lost on contemporary audiences. I doubt that the thought of this being in any way controversial in the context of being sexually explicit would even occur to a younger audience.Biegler is somewhat accomplished at the piano and it is a treat to see Stewart playing a duet with Duke Ellington in one scene. Ellington contributed the music and, although interesting, it did not always create the right mood for me.I would like to read a review by a lawyer. I know little about the law, but I think even in the 50s the prosecution could not have introduced a surprise witness at the last minute during the trial. And it is not clear at all why the dog was brought into the courtroom.*Spoiler* If I had been on the jury I would have voted guilty, so I found its verdict surprising.

With an extremely low budget and a cast of actors and actresses that for the most part had no acting experience whatsoever, it was amazing that the film was made and is as popular amongst the indie crowd as it is today. Grossing over 3 million dollars at the box office, soon it would launch a wave of lower-budget movies about people and their jobs and the lives that intertwines with it, most notably Office Space and Waiting. Unfortunately, I was unable to see what the big fuss is about with Clerks. While it is mildly entertaining, there are much better low-budget films out there with better dialogue and more humor. It's quite an achievement to get so much success when considering how little he had to work with, but aside from that it was a rather mediocre film.Dante is this low self-esteem, bitter, unappreciative clerk that has to fill in for someone else while his boss sneaks away to another state. As the day progresses, a large series of events adds and subtracts from his obviously-gloomy mood, ranging from his girlfriend's past, to his ex-girlfriend getting married, to a hockey game gone wrong, and more. Dante is joined by his sly, fast-talking Randal and outside the store is the odd yet inseparable duo Jay and Silent Bob that offers a few interesting moments. Throughout the film Dante and Randall try to figure out things that happened in the past, why they work such awful jobs, and also argue as to which Star Wars movie had the better ending.With little money and few places to film, the movie relies pretty much all on the dialogue and the interaction amongst the characters. Clerks is a mixed bag in multiple ways the movie is a mix of comedy and a bit of drama, and also sometimes the movie is very smart and very funny, and at other times it's just a bit of a bore. Jay and Silent Bob really aren't that big of a deal in this film, especially when compared to Dogma. Dante's personality is quite annoying, he is always nagging, complaining, whining, and really doesn't give the actor much to work with. Randall on the other hand, provides the best lines, provides the best laughs, and also seems to have the most fun in the film. His moments in the video rental place where he works are priceless, as he takes no bull from the customers and just doesn't care.While the females in the film do not get much screen time, they are available for the biggest laugh and the most depressing moment. Marilyn Ghigliotti (I list this actresses' name because I was most impressed by her performance) as Veronica provides a wonderful monologue basically putting Dante in his place after discovering something that he was going to do. Meanwhile, Caitlin, Dante's ex-girlfriend winds up doing something so unexpected and off the wall; it will throw you off for quite a bit. Either way, it's a hit-or-miss movie, and this does indeed hit for some laughs and some thought-provoking scenes but then sort of misses with jokes that weren't' funny or repetitive quotes or pointless dancing.Bottom Line Not as good as everyone makes it out to be, but it is indeed a film that gives filmmakers with no money hope that someday they'll make it big without needing a ridiculously large budget. The acting was very good for inexperienced actors, the writing was pretty clever, but there isn't much more going for it after that. Being in the quick service industry, I could relate to it a little, but at other times Clerks just sounded like a long complaint captured on film. Clerks Not deserving of classic status, but a benchmark in indie film-making.7\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"24 April 2006","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Clerks is the one film that put Kevin Smith on the map--whether this is a good thing or a bad thing, that is for you to decide.

With an extremely low budget and a cast of actors and actresses that for the most part had no acting experience whatsoever, it was amazing that the film was made and is as popular amongst the indie crowd as it is today. Grossing over 3 million dollars at the box office, soon it would launch a wave of lower-budget movies about people and their jobs and the lives that intertwines with it, most notably Office Space and Waiting. Unfortunately, I was unable to see what the big fuss is about with Clerks. While it is mildly entertaining, there are much better low-budget films out there with better dialogue and more humor. It's quite an achievement to get so much success when considering how little he had to work with, but aside from that it was a rather mediocre film.Dante is this low self-esteem, bitter, unappreciative clerk that has to fill in for someone else while his boss sneaks away to another state. As the day progresses, a large series of events adds and subtracts from his obviously-gloomy mood, ranging from his girlfriend's past, to his ex-girlfriend getting married, to a hockey game gone wrong, and more. Dante is joined by his sly, fast-talking Randal and outside the store is the odd yet inseparable duo Jay and Silent Bob that offers a few interesting moments. Throughout the film Dante and Randall try to figure out things that happened in the past, why they work such awful jobs, and also argue as to which Star Wars movie had the better ending.With little money and few places to film, the movie relies pretty much all on the dialogue and the interaction amongst the characters. Clerks is a mixed bag in multiple ways the movie is a mix of comedy and a bit of drama, and also sometimes the movie is very smart and very funny, and at other times it's just a bit of a bore. Jay and Silent Bob really aren't that big of a deal in this film, especially when compared to Dogma. Dante's personality is quite annoying, he is always nagging, complaining, whining, and really doesn't give the actor much to work with. Randall on the other hand, provides the best lines, provides the best laughs, and also seems to have the most fun in the film. His moments in the video rental place where he works are priceless, as he takes no bull from the customers and just doesn't care.While the females in the film do not get much screen time, they are available for the biggest laugh and the most depressing moment. Marilyn Ghigliotti (I list this actresses' name because I was most impressed by her performance) as Veronica provides a wonderful monologue basically putting Dante in his place after discovering something that he was going to do. Meanwhile, Caitlin, Dante's ex-girlfriend winds up doing something so unexpected and off the wall; it will throw you off for quite a bit. Either way, it's a hit-or-miss movie, and this does indeed hit for some laughs and some thought-provoking scenes but then sort of misses with jokes that weren't' funny or repetitive quotes or pointless dancing.Bottom Line Not as good as everyone makes it out to be, but it is indeed a film that gives filmmakers with no money hope that someday they'll make it big without needing a ridiculously large budget.

I remember when this movie first came out I was in Jr. high school. Colors was a controversial movie talked about by teachers, principles and parents because, believe it or not, it had a tendency for glorification and encouraging gang membership. To my surprise, the movie has little glorification in it and was a grim summary of Los Angeles gang life (and even that of law enforcement.) The movie does not spoon feed its audience, save for a few minor comments that were cheesy at their worst and cleverly woven in at their best. In some cases the portrayal of gang life in LA might have been TOO broad and sophisticated for many viewers. The title COLORS and its implication was meant to explain the rival Crip and Blood gangs but in fact that was merely a pretext. Soon into the movie the viewer is taken into various other neighborhoods as well as other gangs, including WHITE FENCE and 21st Street. For those that denounce this movie as being outdated, cheesy or otherwise, it's hard for me to understand what you are paying attention to. If you remember the 80's in the slightest, it was a time of decadent and flamboyant neon glow ala Prince, Michael Jackson and various other nonsense. The irony is that COLORS portrays a world that was virtually isolated and separate from the 80's because that is what it was MEANT to point out. This was gang life at its peak, before any of the gangster rap hit white suburbia and became a marketable fad. This was BEFORE white folks thought it was cool. It was isolated from the look and feel of the rest of the 80's because this world was isolated from the general population.For this reason I am surprised that anyone would call the movie outdated in any way. Timeless is the word I use to describe it.Despite all this, Hopper manages to incorporate the storyline between Duval and Penn. Not only is this a brilliant interaction between two great actors, it also has a more marketable value to a white audience that would otherwise have been turned off by the subject matter and considered it, unfairly, as a blacksploitation film. Let's face it, Hollywood is big business. The ability to market this movie with ANY semblance of a good plot line but making it even remotely realistic is an amazing achievement. Hopper goes beyond doing both. I would not be surprised to see this movie in the classics section, someday.

In their eternal rage over the recent popularity of the remake, some people like to imagine that whatever original is a classic. This one isn't. It wants to be atmospheric, but it's mostly just uneventful, and endless shots of fog banks aren't especially fascinating, and the bland characters yakking it up aren't terribly remarkable either. The ghost-sailor-zombies are pretty neat, but they don't actually do all that much that we get to see. I don't remember much of anything about the characters at this point, so they must not have been very fascinating, though I do recall being irritated by Jamie Lee Curtis, as per usual. Again, this film is passably interesting, but Carpenter just can't quite generate enough atmosphere to make up for the fact that nothing is actually going on. And though the fog looks pretty nice most of the time, the cinematography is generally pretty bland. (There is one major exception in the form of an excellent shot of a number of ghosts standing in the church, but that's about it.) And, the opening attack on the ship at the beginning is pretty well done, nicely transferring Carpenter's slasher skills to a new genre. But, the film is a whole is just kinda blah. Not quite boring, but far from engrossing, and it has a fairly anti-climactic ending.Frankly, this movie was a perfect candidate for remake. Good concept, passable execution. Though I find it utterly hilarious that people are whining about how this material will 'watered down' for the remake. Hah! This movie isn't gory at all, as in it doesn't have ANY gore in it. We see a few blades and hooks poke at a shirt. That's about it. The remake is actually substantially more graphic than the original, and there is no way in hell that this version would be rated R is it had been released this year. (Well, I won't go quite that far. The MPAA might give anything any rating at any time, but they'd have to be far more confused than usual to place an R on this again.) Apparently some people failed to notice that modern rating standards are a helluva lot more lax than they used to be. Hell, 'The Fog' was less graphic than some PG movies even at the time. 'Jaws', for example, is far more graphic than this, and that came out like 7 years before this. I think they use the, ahem, f-word like once in this movie, which may well be the real reason for the R.On paper this should not have happened. Besides Carpenter, who was coming off well-received efforts like Assault on Precinct 13 and Halloween there is an impressive cast of actors which actually reunites a good bit of the original Halloween crew. Besides Carptenter and Jamie Lee Curtis, there is also the girl who played Annie (Michael's first on screen victim), as well as the guy who played the Sheriff in both H and H-2. Replacing the ubiquitous Donald Pleasance is Hal Halbrook, and the venerable John Houseman makes an appearance in the film's opening as a creepy, storytellin' sea captain. Even Janet Leigh is involved, as the bitchy yet rather likable wife of a Fog victim. Ironically, tis is part of the film's problem, and it has many.First off, there are far too many characters. The film is cluttered with them and for some reason Carpenter disobeyed the standard horror movie order of whittling them down as the film progresses. Most of the victims are throwaways in no way integral to the plot, and nearly everybody introduced at the beginning is still walking around at the end. We needed more killings, not less.Second, the performances. This movie has good actors, but the dialogue is at best inconsistent and at worst embarrassingly stupid. The worst of it is ladeled onto Adrienne Barbeau, who gets to repeat idiocies like, My son is trapped! Trapped by the fog! and Look out, into the darkness....and beware of the fog! Third, the villain(s). Carptenter achieved some neatly creepy atmosphere at the beginning of the film, but he never delivers on it there is no real payoff. This is because he couldn't seem to decide whether it was the fog itself or what was IN the fog was the actual baddie of the film. The result is that no one antagonist ever really emerges. The Fog might as well be a run o' the mill flood - faceless and impersonal.The movie does have its moments -- the creepy opening, the moments of atmospheric horror at sea, and the excellent cinematography, which is used to particular effect on the creepy fog-dwellers. But in the end these fail to outweigh the movie's many flaws.As of today, I still regard Carptenter as the most wildly inconsistent director out there. On the one hand he gave us P-13, Halloween, Escape from New York, and The Thing, all classics (cult or otherwise). On the other hand he also gave us crap like Prince of Darkness and the unwatchable Ghosts of Mars. In between there are the fun but flawed outings like They Live and In the Mouth of Madness.

The Western genre serves as a perfect tableau for this discourse because it is one traditionally dominated by men.

The military, traditional justice, and Christianity are trampled upon, left wondering how these motivated and hard working women could escape their clutches. The film from here takes some twists and turns, and several complete circles. In short, the whores chase a dream of establishing a home for themselves around a mill that Mary Stuart Masterson's late husbands owned, countering the murderous advances of men with their own sexual flaunting.

I admit it, I've only seen MAD MAX 1 & 3 (At the time of me writing this review) however I'm still at a loss to find out what the big fuss over these movies are, now like I said I never seen Part 2, so therefore I maybe doing this series a great injustice, I don't know, but from the ones I've seen so far, especially this one, I can't see where they're all that, I mean MAX 1 was okay but far from being anything to spectacular & MAX 3 manages to be even duller than the first, the villains aren't evil enough, there's not that much action going on & quiet frankly, the direction was a tad sluggish here & there, in fact there was really no point to have a MAD MAX 3, there's really nothing to spectacular plot wise & I'm not so sure having a whole bunch of warrior children as part of the story was a good idea either.

So knowing that, WHAT DID YOU GUYS EXPECT, Malcolm X, Remember The Titans, The Hurricane?? If you were, then maybe you all need to be checked out. The reason why this movie was so great is because it wasn't the typical Denzel 'role model' movie. We KNOW that he can play those roles well so it's a testament to his acting ability that he can portray the other side of the spectrum. And my hat goes off to Ethan because he bounces off Denzel flawlessly.I hate to break the news to you guys but cops like Alonzo ARE OUT THERE and need to be acknowledged. Acting like the problem doesn't exist does not solve it. You don't have to go that deep to know that Alonzo was once a good cop who just got fed up w\/ 'police procedures.' If you acknowledge that Jake's shallow-mindedness at the beginning of the film only allows him to look at the perks of making detective and how the progress of the day transforms him, you can really appreciate Ethan's portrayal of him.

I'm not sure if it was their total lack of chemistry or that they were not acting well, but why we should care so much whether these two stay together was beyond me. Love, affection, playfulness, attraction &#150; none of these materialized on screen in their interactions together.Since I knew that eventually Robert Redford would show up, it was clear from the beginning that the good part, the meat of the movie, would be the scenes between him and Demi Moore. Poor Woody Harrelson just could not muster any emotion at all for the film. He seemed to be holding back, preoccupied with his receding hairline.OK, so fast forward. What idiots these two (Diane and David) are for thinking they can win back the $50,000 they owe by gambling. No acting faux pas there, just hideously bad, lazy, unforgivable writing. Of course they lose all their money. Surprised? I know I wasn't. Enter Robert Redford (John Gage in the film) &#150; a romantic, perhaps emotionally frigid man, an updated Gatsby. A very good role and though not a great, great actor, next to those two, Redford looks like Olivier. He immediately falls in love and lust with Diane and we the viewers for once FEEL it. This is how to love a woman! Not David's way, trading gum mouth to mouth with Diane on a slimy pier. (Did I see that right?) As Gage, Redford wears a suit and tie in every scene. Yes it's meant to instruct the seemingly brain dead audience that here is a Rich Man, but he also looks damn good and by this point the brain dead audience appreciates it! Other wardrobe symbolism includes David's now-ironed shirts at the end of the film, signifying resolve, getting it together after a long interlude of forlorn wrinkled shirt wearing.And what is it with California garden parties as depicted in Hollywood movies? Suddenly everyone appears British, complete with lacy dresses, three piece suits for the men, hats (HATS!) and of course the parasol. Yes Diane, her transformation to Rich Man's fiancée now complete, is there at the auction daintily twirling a parasol. Though she insisted that she couldn't be bought, she succumbed at last to the sexual tension. Here is where the film branches off into pure Americana. I mean, of course David and Diane will end up together, my question is WHY? Diane was bored with David, why not let her ride the Robert Redford wave? And I mean for a good long while? How can she pull herself out of the sexual-romantic thrall of this sexy older man so easily just because Woody Harrelson brings his receding hairline to the garden party, sits himself down and looks Demi Moore in the eyes. That's just not how it goes. He was so WEAK.But we must have our happy ending. We have to swallow the Moral Lesson. We're not sophisticated enough yet to have it otherwise. Director Lyn tried to make a Fatal Attraction for the juvie set, the young'uns.In addition to garden parties in which there's nary an SUV, tee shirt, or baseball cap in sight, such films also feature a reliable public transportation system that connects far-flung California cities and municipalities.

What a magnificent work - visually it is as powerful as the painting Nolte's Lionel was painting. Combining in one short film Procul Harum's A whiter shade of pale and Puccini's Nessun Dorma from Turandot was a stroke of genius. This film is an ode to the power of talent; it is about greatness and curse of the gift, not about love to the woman. The best scene of the film and I'd say one of the best ever made about the Artist's work is Nolte triumphantly painting his masterpiece - his love, desire, lust, cries, whispers, tears, and humiliations magically transform with every stroke of his brush into the immortal, triumphant, brilliant work of art. By the time the painting is finished, he would need a new source of inspiration and self-torture, and the cycle will repeat over again. Devilishly clever portrait of an Artist as Not a Young Man. 9.5\/10 I loved Woody Allen's Oedipus Wrecks and I think it is very funny and touching.

Combining in one short film Procul Harum's A whiter shade of pale and Puccini's Nessun Dorma from Turandot was a stroke of genius. This film is an ode to the power of talent; it is about greatness and curse of the gift, not about love to the woman. The best scene of the film and I'd say one of the best ever made about the Artist's work is Nolte triumphantly painting his masterpiece - his love, desire, lust, cries, whispers, tears, and humiliations magically transform with every stroke of his brush into the immortal, triumphant, brilliant work of art. By the time the painting is finished, he would need a new source of inspiration and self-torture, and the cycle will repeat over again. Devilishly clever portrait of an Artist as Not a Young Man. 9.5\/10 I loved Woody Allen's Oedipus Wrecks and I think it is very funny and touching. Looks like Allen has met mothers or grandmothers like Mrs. Millstein in real life and his little gem is his love-hate letter to them. In the end, mom always knows what is best for her little boy. Mae Questel and Julie Kavner (Marge Simpson) were wonderful. Woody's face after his mom disappears and the scene when he practically makes love to the chicken drumstick are pure delight; also the commentary that New York is used to everything and readily accepts the crazy situation - it is so true. One of the best Allen's films I've seen lately - I am very glad that I finally saw it.Larry David (Seinfeld, Curb Your Enthusiasm) plays the Theater Manager.

I have never agreed with this opinion. Crawford's Crystal is fun, sure, but I can imagine any number of actresses could do the part as well (just take a look at her co-worker at the perfrume counter who gets in a few good lines too). For me, it's Norma Shearer's picture from start to finish. Yes, she's grand in the old Hollywood tradition with that upper crust manner of speaking they liked to affect back then (her mother is even worse) but I suppose that kind of drama is needed to put over such an anti-women's lib script as this one. I don't understand how so many reviewers cite her arm-stretching gesture at the end as over-dramatic silent-film acting. She is afterall going back to her husband who we have never seen. What was she supposed to be reaching for? On that same note I still cringe whenever Mary decides that even after two years of her ex-husband's philandering, she can't wait to take the jerk back. And the way the women are so spoiled is outrageous too. Even the Catholic one who does nothing but have baby after baby (thank God she's rich!!) gets to have enough maids and servants so that the children are more of an annoyance than a responsibility. Any even though everyone seems to rave about Rosalind Russell, I find her part the most over the top. And whoever thinks this movie is as timely today as it was in 1939 must really be living in la la land. Can you imagine the reaction of today's women to these five who do nothing but live for their husbands? There'd be a riot at the movie house! Nevertheless, the real gem of the picture is the Countess De Lav. I always get a kick out of when she says on the train to Reno I don't pick them for character.
