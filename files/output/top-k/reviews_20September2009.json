The fourth film which follows this entry is the laughable Batman & Robin, which many people regard as one of the worst films ever made. But, in being so indescribably bizarre and over-the-top-awful, Batman & Robin functioned as an unintentional comedy, and actually I watch it a few times a year with friends and beers for laughs... So in a strange way it works quite well. This film, however, is very transitional with Schumacher and the studio's attempt to make a very kiddy movie that appeals to a wider audience. And so, it doesn't have the dark edge or intriguing plots of Burton's Batman and Batman Returns... Nor is it quite silly enough to become an unintentional classic like Batman & Robin. What we're left with is Batman Forever... an OK-but-not-great movie that just feels weird compared to the other films.Starring Val Kilmer as Bruce Wayne \/ Batman (taking over for Michael Keaton, who I've read wasn't pleased with the new, lighter and friendlier direction), this entry follows the dark knight as he tangles with two villains... Two-Face, the disfigured remnant of DA Harvey Dent, and the Riddler... a questioning mastermind with a taste for puzzles, who is more-or-less an answer to the Joker. Tommy Lee Jones portrays Two-Face in a performance that is just way too over-the-top, while Jim Carrey's Riddler is similarly insane, yet somehow works.As the film opens, Batman is thwarting Two-Face's attempt to rob a bank, which is also a trap to lure Batman in. After a fairly well-executed helicopter sequence, we are introduced to Edward Nigma (Carrey... and boy, you gotta love a name like that!), who works for Wayne enterprises and is developing a new form of television entertainment which involves reading and interacting with the viewer's brain-waves to create a completely virtual-reality-like experience. After Bruce Wayne is forced to deny Nigma's invention due to the dangers of tampering with the brain waves of a populous, Nigma looses his cool, and vows some sort of revenge on him... I don't know, the film moved pretty fast and I just didn't get that part.We also have a number of sub-plots, including a romance between Wayne and psychologist Dr. Chase Meridian (the beautiful Nicole Kidman), which was nice, but a bit creepy to me... She's just a little to... I dunno... school-girlish in her flirty behavior. We are also introduced to Dick Grayson (Chris O'Donnell... doing an alright job), who lost his family during an attack by Two-Face. Feeling slightly responsible for not having saved his parents, Bruce agrees to take care of Grayson, and the two form a troubled relationship, as Grayson wants revenge, while Bruce wants to steer him towards good.Of course, we know Dick will discover Wayne's secret and eventually join him as Robin, his sidekick, but the film does a halfway decent job at creating a tension between the characters.All-in-all, the acting is solid. Not great but solid. Kilmer is admirable, and for every awful performance, there is a good one to even it out. And the action is well done. But the movie just crumbles when it comes to the style and story.Schumacher's vibe just doesn't jive very well with what Burton had established. And if it weren't for the presence of Pat Hingle and Michael Gough as Commissioner Gordon and butler Alfred respectively, this very well could have been the start of a brand new series.I'm very torn... this film is just in the middle of good and bad. The only thing I really liked was Elliot Goldenthal's score, which is more cartoonish but still dark. But other than that... it's just average... And in this series, where everything else seems to be in absolutes (the first two were great, the fourth was awful)... That just doesn't sit well.Overall, Batman Forever definitely isn't bad...

Not that Germans are immune to the grandiose nature of the nationalism (excuse me, I mean *patriotism* of course) that inspires many American films, and after all, films that portray German nationalism positively are not that well received, so what is a German director who likes trite militaristic show-offs and personality cults revolving around the local alpha male to do?

It is very difficult to be on their side, especially when on the other side the top terrorist makes statements that in 2009, after 8 years of Bush junior, countless proxy wars, several more US-backed coups and in the middle of another Iraq war, are probably much more popular than in the 90s.

I should have watched it right after I bought the DVD. I have to say that I don't enjoy watching concert films much, nor do I like to listen to live recordings. Often, the music just isn't as definitive when it's played live. But at the same time you get to see the band perform so there is a payoff. Still, concerts can drag on, and can get boring because you have to watch the same band or artist perform for an hour or more. I've seen concert films before, even by great bands, but I didn't like them much. However, Stop Making Sense is an exception. Not just because the music is good and has so much energy, but also because the performance is well directed and presented.Directed by Jonathan Demme, Stop Making Sense was shot over three nights in December 1983, as the group was touring to promote their new album Speaking In Tongues. The movie is notable for being the first made entirely utilizing digital audio techniques. The band raised the budget of $1.2 million themselves. The title comes from a repeated phrase in the song Girlfriend Is Better. At the beginning of the film David Byrne, the lead singer of the Talking Heads, walks on to the stage with a boom box and an acoustic guitar and then performs Psycho Killer. He's just one man, but watching him is interesting, and the song is great too. With each successive song, Byrne is cumulatively joined onstage by each core member of the band first by Tina Weymouth for Heaven, second by Chris Frantz for Thank You For Sending Me An Angel, and third by Jerry Harrison for Found A Job. The Talking Heads also continue to be augmented by several additional musicians, most of whom had extensive experience in funk.David Byrne is a very energetic performer. Even the way he moved his body was fun to watch. He even put on that now famous big suit towards the end of the film. In addition, I really liked Tina Weymouth in this film. She's just the cutest bass player ever. I have to stress that Stop Making Sense isn't just a bunch of playing and singing. The band manages to make each song stand out. The faster songs are performed with plenty of energy and enthusiasm, while the slower songs sound beautiful and make you wonder. The film contains no audience shots until the very end to enable the viewer to form their own opinion about the performance. Byrne wanted no colored lights to illuminate the performers. This led to some unusual lighting methods being used for each song. Unlike many concert films\/videos which use MTV-style quick-cut editing techniques, much of Stop Making Sense uses lengthy camera shots to allow the viewer to examine the performances and onstage interaction. In conclusion, Stop Making Sense is the definitive concert film. You don't even have to be a fan of the band or their music to like it. It's so good that you'll probably want to see it many times.

He lived a tragic life, being taught to play and write music at a young age, living a life where music was the most important thing of his life, lived for most of his life in debt and died young. So a bio-pic of one of Austria's greatest sons seems like a great subject.Amadeus is based on a play by Peter Shaffer, and directed by Milo&#x9A; Forman who did excellent work with another play conversion, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (please note it was also a novel). The focus of this film is on the Italian composer Antonio Salieri (F. Murray Abraham), who was Emperor Joseph II (Jeffrey Jones) of Austria's court composer. Salieri was a man who wanted to know Mozart (Tom Hulce) because of his talent, but dishearted to discovery he was really no more then a man-child. Mozart is rude, volga, insulting and loves nothing but to drink and party. He seems like he doesn't have to try to make great music and insults Salieri's efforts. Salieri sets himself a mission to destroy Mozart, making him lost favour within the court, make such he can't get money and drive him insane.Let's start out of the good points. They is great music, there is no denying it. They are great pieces by Mozart and Salieri throughout the film. Even if you don't know classical music that well you properly heard some of Mozart's pieces. This film is Milo&#x9A; Forman's best performance as a director. I love One Flow Over the Cuckoo's Nest, but that was more an actor's film then one that show's a director's talent. With Amadeus Forman keeps the story going, focusing on the characters, the themes and uses the music to great affect. They are a number of good scenes throughout the film and he deserves a best director nod. He uses the music very effectively, such as when Salieri looks at Mozart's pieces on paper. They is wonderful art direction, getting the piece and the way the court look right. The Stanley Kubrick film Barry Lyndon must have been an influence. The script is well structured, going back and forth from the framing device. F. Murray Abraham offers an excellent performance as Salieri, being both a hero and a villain at the same possible. He deserved his Oscar as well. The film also looks at the themes of mass-produced music, whether it is better to produce music for the elites or the masses, the theme of envy and how it could affect a man to explore his dark side and the fact that Mozart's talent is both his gift and his curse; how it ended up destroying him.But this film is not perfect. I did not like the casting of Tom Hulce, except for the scene of Mozart dying I thought his performance was weak. He has a very annoying laugh and just seems too focused on making the character look at something from the Frat Pack. Kenneth Branngh would was originally casted would have been a lot better. I also did not like the script using modern language and the use of profanity. I think this was done to dumb down the film and appeal to Americans ready then for artistic merit. The film is also historically inaccurate; normally it would drop points with me but they are strengths and I love the music. I dislike how Mozart was portrayed, being so immature and so volger. In real they was mutual respect between Mozart and Salieri. At times you couldn't feel sympathy for Mozart.If you enjoy Mozart's music you will like this film. It is a good drama, but worthy of top 250? Doubtful. But it's worth watching.

What makes it so good is that it very sensibly doesn't try to change what happened. Too many movies based on actual events change things for whatever reason, but real life is crazy and silly enough not to have to. So, yes, Yeager did break his ribs and couldn't close his aircraft door, yes, John Glenn did see fireflies in outer space, yes, many of the chief scientists on both sides were German (most from the V-2 Rocket project), yes, Cooper fell asleep on the launchpad, yes Lyndon Johnson really was like that. Why make stuff up when truth is stranger than fiction ? Kaufman takes all the juiciest, funniest and most dramatic bits from this incredible endeavour and turns in a film which is a great ensemble piece, an incredible historical document, and an evocative depiction of the wonder and majesty of the exploration of outer space. When Glenn orbits in Friendship 7 and cries little tears of light reflected on his helmet, the movie reaches its most sublime moment, a triumphant distillation of what mankind is capable of. Just as dazzling is the technical artistry which went into the making of this film, invisibly mixing up footage shot twenty years apart, recreating not only the period but incredibly detailed events within it, using visual effects in the most creative way. The big cast is simply one of the best I've ever seen in any movie ever, with Harris, Glenn, Moffat and Reed all just outstanding, but absolutely everybody is good in this (Goldblum and Shearer are a very funny double act). Everything else - music, design, photography, editing, wardrobe - is seamlessly integrated into this incredible story, and Kaufman pulls the very best out his army of people. I find long pictures often drag and are self-indulgent, and anything that comes out at three hours had better be up to Kurosawa standards or I usually want to rip it to shreds (Reds, JFK, most movies by Richard Attenborough).

Watching it reminded me of the first time I saw Scarface and the underwhelming reaction it provoked. It strikes me as being a film people profess to be great because of its cult image and because the older kids at school said it was good when it came out. It's not.

In the day and age of the Cold War with proxy wars happening around the globe, and with the memory of Vietnam still fresh in everyone's memory (and Afghanistan coming into the forefront), Star Wars was a unifying reminder of the consequences of delegating freedom to a kind of social automation of the spirit; i.e. allowing extreme organization and ceremony to act as a mechanism for social order, the consequences of that, and how a single soul can combat such stalwart foes.Personally, I love the film for what it is.

We begin by seeing it as a small, independent film from Europe that may be interesting to observe if only for the culture and the obvious linguistic differences. By the end of the last minute, we can't believe how such a seemingly small film has been able to move us, and how it has been able to force us into thinking about heavy and potentially disturbing topics that we've all come to wonder about at some point of our lives...and it does so with such precision and searing accuracy, that we wonder how we couldn't have noticed such a gem before.The film deals with a 14th century crusader (Max Von Sydow) who's returning from the Holy Land after many years of endless battle, and on his way home, he encounters the Angel of Death on a long-forgotten beach. Death has, obviously, come to claim him at last, as He has been known to do so for quite a while, what with the Plague finishing off most of Europe with the pest. This particular crusader, an important and intelligent man, decides to challenge Death in a game of chess he forestalls his demise until the game is over, and if he wins death will move one and let him live for many more years. If Death wins...well, you'll see.As the crusader fights an endless game of chess with Death, he travels with his faithful but constantly reproaching squire back to his castle. On the way, they meet a number of interesting characters that help (or, actually, make up) the plot of the film. Each character embodies a different take on the religious aspect of the Dark Ages, and provides, each in his\/her own way, a particular point of view on the themes of death, the afterlife, and moral correct-ness.The crusader himself has doubts about this, doubts that never let him sleep and that are troubling his existence What is there in the afterlife? Is there a God and a Devil? Is there even an afterlife or is there simply nothingness once you die? Death is, naturally, vague about these topics and refuses to relinquish any information as he plays chess with the crusader, but the characters he meets provide their own hypotheses to these questions and add to his infinite wisdom. Our crusader decides that he will die only until he has corrected some wrongs in his life and, more importantly, until he has performed a good deed that will finally make his existence on earth valuable.But these are very difficult questions to be answered, and Ingmar Bergman makes a point of heightening the difficulty by placing the moral and emotional struggles smack down the middle ages and their obscurely slovenly society. The dialogue and reflective monologues from the characters establish the ideas that torment the characters, and the images that are presented heighten the intensity of the topics (unflinchingly) to astronomical heights, involving the viewer not only in the story and development of the film, but on the director's point and art as well.The images seen are some of the most famous and remembered in all of cinematic history; they're short episodes the characters witness, and they're burned into the viewer's mind forever a procession of martyrs who travel around the country in self-flagellation and pleading for God's forgiveness; a woman who has consorted with the devil and has her hands and feet stoned and broken, and is finally burned at the stake; a poor and kind-hearted juggler who dances like a bear to save his life from an amoral and sodomite crowd; the Virgin Mary walking with her naked infant in a meadow; a joyous picnic between newfound friends (the scene that, I believe, anchors the point of the film and upsets the general angst and normalized horror the rest of the film presents); and, more importantly, the scene where the crusader confesses himself to Death, exposing in a very well-organised monologue the pain and insecurity humans feel towards nothingness and their man-made need to believe in a God that gives sense to our trajectory in earth and our possible entrance to the Next World.I won't go into analyzing the characters the crusader meets.

It was treated with an exorbitant amount of acuteness and love, and the topics were so well-presented and developed, that I could write page after page about what I learned, what I think, and how each minute of the film could only advance my wonderment.

We begin by seeing it as a small, independent film from Europe that may be interesting to observe if only for the culture and the obvious linguistic differences. By the end of the last minute, we can't believe how such a seemingly small film has been able to move us, and how it has been able to force us into thinking about heavy and potentially disturbing topics that we've all come to wonder about at some point of our lives...and it does so with such precision and searing accuracy, that we wonder how we couldn't have noticed such a gem before.The film deals with a 14th century crusader (Max Von Sydow) who's returning from the Holy Land after many years of endless battle, and on his way home, he encounters the Angel of Death on a long-forgotten beach. Death has, obviously, come to claim him at last, as He has been known to do so for quite a while, what with the Plague finishing off most of Europe with the pest. This particular crusader, an important and intelligent man, decides to challenge Death in a game of chess he forestalls his demise until the game is over, and if he wins death will move one and let him live for many more years. If Death wins...well, you'll see.As the crusader fights an endless game of chess with Death, he travels with his faithful but constantly reproaching squire back to his castle. On the way, they meet a number of interesting characters that help (or, actually, make up) the plot of the film. Each character embodies a different take on the religious aspect of the Dark Ages, and provides, each in his\/her own way, a particular point of view on the themes of death, the afterlife, and moral correct-ness.The crusader himself has doubts about this, doubts that never let him sleep and that are troubling his existence What is there in the afterlife? Is there a God and a Devil? Is there even an afterlife or is there simply nothingness once you die? Death is, naturally, vague about these topics and refuses to relinquish any information as he plays chess with the crusader, but the characters he meets provide their own hypotheses to these questions and add to his infinite wisdom. Our crusader decides that he will die only until he has corrected some wrongs in his life and, more importantly, until he has performed a good deed that will finally make his existence on earth valuable.But these are very difficult questions to be answered, and Ingmar Bergman makes a point of heightening the difficulty by placing the moral and emotional struggles smack down the middle ages and their obscurely slovenly society.

Not 24 hours into the job, she seduces him in quite a graphic scene and then accuses him of sexual harassment. I'm not giving anything away; that is the set-up. But why would she?

There's a lot of suspense, mystery, good acting, dialogue and originality here. Sure, it's enormously dated &#x96; in reference to the modern computer gadgets, but everything else is still fresh.

But what I find with Hitchcock is that with some thoughtful consideration after the fact, there are usually some annoying little details that the Master himself never fully deals with. What intrigued me the most about the story was that Gavin Elster (Tom Helmore) put Scottie Ferguson (James Stewart) on the trail of a phony Mrs. Elster right from the very start. So we never even get to see the REAL Mrs. Elster. Which is OK as far as that goes, but doesn't it strike you as curious that Mrs. Elster would never think about using the car when 'Madeleine' was out and about tooling around San Francisco leading Scottie on his mission?Then there's 'Judy' putting on the Carlotta Valdez necklace to go out on a date with Scottie - holy smokes! - where were the alarm bells on that one? You mean to tell me Judy couldn't make that connection? Actually, it wouldn't have been the first time a piece of jewelry helped identify a murderer, but it was done with a bit more finesse in 1945's Conflict, with Humphrey Bogart being tripped up by a stickpin brooch.Finally, I have some trouble with the final scene where Judy 'accidentally' falls to her death. It's just too convenient an ending, much like Uncle Charlie's demise at the end of another Hitchcock thriller from 1943, Shadow Of A Doubt. Just how did Judy manage to fall off the the bell tower landing when Scottie himself needed three steps to get to the edge?Aside from all that though, the story is a compelling one and does convey an air of intrigue and mystery, especially in the early going when the viewer rides along with Scottie following the intricate deception that Madeleine lays out. It's too bad Scottie didn't take Midge (Barbara Bel Geddes) along for the ride, she might have been able to smoke out the whole ruse.If I'm being too nit-picky about the film, it's because Hitchcock has this reputation as one of the all time great directors, yet a lot of the story doesn't ring true under close inspection. I've found the same to be the case for some of his other pictures, like Strangers On A Train, Rope, and the earlier referenced Shadow Of a Doubt. But to be fair, he also had some thrillers that were exceptional, namely Dial M For Murder and North By Northwest.One last thought, and this one bothered me throughout the whole picture - how was Scottie rescued from the ledge in the opening scene?

A memorable introduction for the character involves him stealing a car from a mean spirited, uber-conservative sleaze and driving it off a bridge, while he leaps to safety with a parachute as friends record it from the sidelines.At the same time, NSA Agent Augustus Gibbons (my favorite actor of all time, Samuel L. Jackson) is dealing with the loss of an agent looking for a mysterious computer chip in the Czech Republic. He decides to try a new initiative- sending in a new kind of undercover agent, one who isn't a trained operative, but rather is a real civilian with real street-smarts. And so, he lands on Xander.After Gibbons abducts Xander and places him into a few tests of will, smarts and physicality, Xander accepts the responsibility to infiltrate the mysterious Criminal Organization Anarchy 99, where he must stop their leader from making a deadly biological attack.The film is basically an MTV version of James Bond... rather than being suave, Xander's edgy... Rather than intricate gadgets, he's got a whole mess of guns and explosives... Rather than being charming, Xander is blunt but cool. Etc. Although it is hard not to notice the James Bond influence... Xander's got his own version of M, his own version of Q (in that he has a gadget-guy)... his own bond girl (in Argento's character, the presumable girlfriend of the villain). And the movie's very loose plot line is vaguely Bond-esquire.The acting is par for the most part. Diesel is a lot of fun to watch, and Argento and Jackson deliver decent performances. The supporting cast, mainly the villains, are very cliché but work.Rob Cohen's direction is really what elevates this film. While character development isn't really writer Rich Wilkes strong point here, he does supply Cohen and Diesel with enough spectacles to make this worth watching for the action alone. Cohen's guidance of the camera and actors in the many intricate action set-pieces and beats is impressive, and I'm willing to say that a scene involving a motorcycle chase during a drug-raid in Columbia is flat-out one of the best action-sequences I've ever seen.I guess it boils down to this... the film is a big, bloated silly piece of moronic fluff. But it is most certainly a very entertaining piece of big, bloated, silly, moronic fluff. I loved it when it first came out (when I was about 14) and I still enjoy watching it from time-to-time, at the age of 21. And I most certainly will see any new sequels involving Diesel's character in theaters. (I skipped the first sequel, xXx State of the Union, because it was the bad kind of fluff, where even the fluff went stale, and also most of the characters were replaced for no real reason.) Overall, I'm giving xXx a 7 out of 10. It's silly, but vastly entertaining. If you're in the mood for a light thrill-ride, then I'll guide you with our hero's catch-phrase- Welcome to the Xander-Zone! Aka, see xXx. ","genre":null},{"date":"20 September 2009","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" From director Rob Cohen (Dragon The Bruce Lee Story; The Fast and the Furious) comes the insane-o 2002 action spectacle xXx (triple x), staring Vin Diesel and the beautiful Asia Argento.Xander Cage (Diesel) is a daredevil who is wanted by the police for a number of charges, all relating to his awe-inspiring (but very illegal) stunt-work. A memorable introduction for the character involves him stealing a car from a mean spirited, uber-conservative sleaze and driving it off a bridge, while he leaps to safety with a parachute as friends record it from the sidelines.At the same time, NSA Agent Augustus Gibbons (my favorite actor of all time, Samuel L. Jackson) is dealing with the loss of an agent looking for a mysterious computer chip in the Czech Republic. He decides to try a new initiative- sending in a new kind of undercover agent, one who isn't a trained operative, but rather is a real civilian with real street-smarts. And so, he lands on Xander.After Gibbons abducts Xander and places him into a few tests of will, smarts and physicality, Xander accepts the responsibility to infiltrate the mysterious Criminal Organization Anarchy 99, where he must stop their leader from making a deadly biological attack.The film is basically an MTV version of James Bond... rather than being suave, Xander's edgy... Rather than intricate gadgets, he's got a whole mess of guns and explosives... Rather than being charming, Xander is blunt but cool. Etc. Although it is hard not to notice the James Bond influence... Xander's got his own version of M, his own version of Q (in that he has a gadget-guy)... his own bond girl (in Argento's character, the presumable girlfriend of the villain). And the movie's very loose plot line is vaguely Bond-esquire.The acting is par for the most part. Diesel is a lot of fun to watch, and Argento and Jackson deliver decent performances. The supporting cast, mainly the villains, are very cliché but work.Rob Cohen's direction is really what elevates this film. While character development isn't really writer Rich Wilkes strong point here, he does supply Cohen and Diesel with enough spectacles to make this worth watching for the action alone. Cohen's guidance of the camera and actors in the many intricate action set-pieces and beats is impressive, and I'm willing to say that a scene involving a motorcycle chase during a drug-raid in Columbia is flat-out one of the best action-sequences I've ever seen.I guess it boils down to this... the film is a big, bloated silly piece of moronic fluff. But it is most certainly a very entertaining piece of big, bloated, silly, moronic fluff. I loved it when it first came out (when I was about 14) and I still enjoy watching it from time-to-time, at the age of 21. And I most certainly will see any new sequels involving Diesel's character in theaters. (I skipped the first sequel, xXx State of the Union, because it was the bad kind of fluff, where even the fluff went stale, and also most of the characters were replaced for no real reason.) Overall, I'm giving xXx a 7 out of 10. It's silly, but vastly entertaining.

","genre":"Action, Adventure"},{"date":"20 September 2009","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" I can't say how this compares to other films in the Friday the Thirteenth franchise as I'd only seen one of them before and that was twenty years ago. Thankfully you don't really need to have seen previous instalments to understand what is going on. We are told several times that the hockey mask wearing Jason Vorhees is an unstoppable killer then we see him killing lots of people who's efforts to kill him barely slow him down.I don't know if it was deliberate but this film seemed to have elements of lots of other science fiction films including Alien (unstoppable killer in space), Demolition Man (Killer and person who knows what he is cryogenically frozen) and Aliens (gung-ho space soldiers killed easily and somebody trying to keep the danger alive for money). While this might make the film derivative it didn't spoil the entertainment for me.The film opens with Jason chained up in preparation for cryogenic imprisonment at a facility run by Rowan, a scientist played by Lexa Doig. Soon the military turn up to take Jason away for research but before one can say psycho killer Jason is out of his chains and they are dead. Rowan lures him to the cryogenic chamber and captures him, unfortunately for her he breaches the container and she is also frozen. Four hundred years later the Earth is uninhabitable and the facility is being examined by archaeologists who find Rowan and Jason and take them back to their spaceship. Once there they thaw Rowan and assure her that Jason is dead. Of course he is soon on his feet killing scantily clad students and soldiers in a variety of imaginative ways.While nobody was about to win any acting Oscars for this I thought Lexa Doig did a good enough job as Rowan, Lisa Ryder was OK as android Kay-Em 14 and Peter Mensah put in a decent performance as Sgt. Brodski, the rest of the cast were fairly forgettable, they were just there to look pretty and die. The special effects were pretty good for the most part, certainly better than I'd expected from part ten of a slasher franchise.Several people have said this will only appeal to fans of the series, I have to disagree with this as I thought it was fun... perhaps it only appeals to fans of the series or fans of second rate science fiction.
