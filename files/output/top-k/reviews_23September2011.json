With the rise of reality TV in the late 90's, loss of personal privacy was a hot subject and so it's quite legitimate for more then one movie to be made about it; and both movies treat the subject differently, Truman with a more philosophical angle and EdTV with a social one, and with a more comedic direction. And the story does bring its own message, one that's poignant and clear and aged well over the last decade of reality-reign.Unfortunately , none of that helps the fact that the movie just isn't very good. Ron Howard's directorial work, as it always is, is professional but hollow, using every trick of the trade ably and without soul.

The dialog may have been written specifically to sound everyday and authentic, but a lot of the lines would have sounded unrealistic if spoken on Big Brother. As for the acting - the horrible Matthew McConaughey actually pulls off a better-than-average performance for his abilities, but it's not enough to pull it together; Woody Harrelson is mediocre at best; much worse yet are two mediocre TV actresses - Jenna Elfman and Ellen DeGeneres - who told Ellen she could act? - who really fall short with very flat characters and very unconvincing deliveries. Some quality supporting actors - Martin Landau, Dennis Hopper and Rob Reiner in a terrific performance - and some nice cameos from Jay Leno, Bill Maher, Michael Moore and other prominent media men of the time, help it along but it's not enough.So for the story alone, it's worth a watch, and it makes some pretty interesting points about the role of the media in demolishing personal freedoms (and it's quite amazing that it was made before the Bush administration, because some direct connections could easily be made) and it's often enjoyable, but while The Truman Show and Pleasantville may be remembered for many years to come, EdTV is ultimately as forgettable as any middle-of-the-road American comedy.

If anything, it's more of a culmination of Allen's two preceding works - Love & Death and Annie Hall; an intentionally comedic Ingmar Bergman homage with dark undertones, and an intentionally dark comedy with dramatic undertones and Ingmar Bergman references. Interiors is a direct Bergman homage without the slightest bit of a sense of humor, which is something that cannot be said of any other Allen film in the 70's, not even Manhattan. And other than that important placement in Allen's career - first straight drama, and of course first film without a starring role - it's a strong film by its own right.It's not a masterpiece, no. Just like some of the dramas Woody directed in the 00's - Cassandra's Dream or Vicky Cristina Barcelona - his influences are a bit too transparent in Interiors, and the film is not self-aware enough for that to be a good thing. That is to say, it feels more like Allen shadowing Bergman than Allen saying something original and personal while referencing Bergman. And yet, at its best moments, Interiors does feel personal and quite poignant. Even when the script turns needlessly brainy in a way that makes the dialog feel unrealistic, every scene is shot beautifully - more beautifully than any Allen film before, and in that way the bridge to Manhattan is important - and the acting is so fantastic that the dialog somehow works, most of all Geraldine Page in one of the last and best performances in her career.Interiors is essential to Allen fans, and not just for biographical context, though they may be disappointed by not finding any of his trademarks.

On the field Stone does capture much of the excitement and passion which makes people love the sport. He also is probably reasonably accurate with much of his depiction of the off-field excesses of our modern-day gladiators. But both on and off the field he probably goes a little too far. He pushed it a little beyond the point of realism and believability. Modern professional football is a grand spectacle but perhaps Stone made it just a little too grand for this movie's good.With Stone laying bare some brutal truths the NFL was never going to have anything to do with this movie. So the story follows the fictional Miami Sharks of the fictional AFFA. Their veteran coach Tony D'Amato has had a distinguished career but has the game passed him by? The team's owner certainly thinks so. Oh, by the way that owner, Christina Pagniacci, is played by Cameron Diaz. Cameron Diaz owns a football team? OK then. Well, it turns out daddy died and left his daughter the team. And Christina is no shrinking violet. She is driven and determined. Which is a nice way of saying she's a bitch. When she isn't making her coach's life miserable she's trying to blackmail Miami's mayor for a new stadium. She thinks she's in control but does anyone really respect her? The answer to that question may well disappoint her. Meanwhile his raving shrew of an owner is far from Tony's only problem. In the first game we see the Sharks lose their star veteran quarterback to injury. And then lose his backup. Enter Willie Beamen. And all hell breaks loose.In no time at all Beamen goes from anonymous third-string quarterback to superstar. Really, I mean no time at all. Sorry Mr. Stone but I don't care how well you play you don't go from complete unknown to having your own rap video and your picture on the side of every bus in town in two weeks. Just one clear instance of the movie not really ringing true. Anyhow, Beamen's winning games and exciting fans but he's driving his coach and teammates nuts. He ignores the coach, makes up his own plays, does it all his way. And despite his success he ends up tearing his team apart. The coach sees this happening and tries to rein Beamen in but it's a futile effort. Especially when the owner doesn't back the coach. The Sharks are now winning games but there's conflict all over the place. Everyone's got their own agenda. The owner, the coach, the players, the doctors, everyone's pulling in their own direction. This seems destined for a spectacular blowup.Stone has a great ensemble cast but there are two roles clearly more important than the rest. The movie is at its heart about two men, Coach Tony D'Amato and Steamin Willie Beamen. Al Pacino plays the coach and is as good as you would expect. A little over the top in some moments but the whole movie goes a little over the top in many moments. And Pacino is very good in the quieter moments such as heart-to-hearts with his two quarterbacks, the aging star and the young hotshot. Speaking of that young hotshot Jamie Foxx plays Beamen and captures all the character's excesses wonderfully while also conveying the hurt and frustration of a guy who never felt he was given a fair shot in football or in life. It's Pacino and Foxx who really have to carry the movie and they do a very good job of it. But they have plenty of support. Diaz is surprisingly effective in a role which certainly does not seem tailor-made for her. Dennis Quaid, James Woods, Matthew Modine, Aaron Eckhart, Ann-Margret...the list goes on and on. Notable performers who all add something to the film. There's also room for real-life football stars. Jim Brown we already knew could act. Lawrence Taylor is a pleasant surprise. He plays an old, broken-down linebacker facing the end of his career and his own personal demons. So basically, LT's playing himself. And he handles that very well.So the cast is generally excellent and the story's entertaining enough so why is there the nagging sense that the movie's not quite as good as it could have been? One problem is the football action. Stone takes you right onto the field, capturing the sound and fury. But he goes too far. Realism takes a back seat as we're presented with a lot of rather cartoonish football, guys doing full-twisting double somersaults into the end zone and such. The game is exciting enough as is, Stone didn't need to crank it up past the point of truth. And a lot of the off the field stuff goes a little too far as well. There's a lot of craziness and excess. Our on-field warriors are wild men off the field. A little too wild at times to take the movie seriously. And then there's the central plot point, Beamen's rise to instant superstardom. The media makes stars quickly but not that quickly. It's just not really believable. Coach D'Amato tells us football is a game of grabbing that last inch. Any Given Sunday comes close but when we stretch out the chains it comes up just that inch short.

Well, it turns out daddy died and left his daughter the team. And Christina is no shrinking violet. She is driven and determined. Which is a nice way of saying she's a bitch. When she isn't making her coach's life miserable she's trying to blackmail Miami's mayor for a new stadium. She thinks she's in control but does anyone really respect her? The answer to that question may well disappoint her. Meanwhile his raving shrew of an owner is far from Tony's only problem. In the first game we see the Sharks lose their star veteran quarterback to injury. And then lose his backup. Enter Willie Beamen. And all hell breaks loose.In no time at all Beamen goes from anonymous third-string quarterback to superstar. Really, I mean no time at all. Sorry Mr. Stone but I don't care how well you play you don't go from complete unknown to having your own rap video and your picture on the side of every bus in town in two weeks. Just one clear instance of the movie not really ringing true. Anyhow, Beamen's winning games and exciting fans but he's driving his coach and teammates nuts. He ignores the coach, makes up his own plays, does it all his way. And despite his success he ends up tearing his team apart. The coach sees this happening and tries to rein Beamen in but it's a futile effort. Especially when the owner doesn't back the coach. The Sharks are now winning games but there's conflict all over the place. Everyone's got their own agenda. The owner, the coach, the players, the doctors, everyone's pulling in their own direction. This seems destined for a spectacular blowup.Stone has a great ensemble cast but there are two roles clearly more important than the rest. The movie is at its heart about two men, Coach Tony D'Amato and Steamin Willie Beamen. Al Pacino plays the coach and is as good as you would expect. A little over the top in some moments but the whole movie goes a little over the top in many moments. And Pacino is very good in the quieter moments such as heart-to-hearts with his two quarterbacks, the aging star and the young hotshot. Speaking of that young hotshot Jamie Foxx plays Beamen and captures all the character's excesses wonderfully while also conveying the hurt and frustration of a guy who never felt he was given a fair shot in football or in life. It's Pacino and Foxx who really have to carry the movie and they do a very good job of it. But they have plenty of support. Diaz is surprisingly effective in a role which certainly does not seem tailor-made for her. Dennis Quaid, James Woods, Matthew Modine, Aaron Eckhart, Ann-Margret...the list goes on and on. Notable performers who all add something to the film. There's also room for real-life football stars. Jim Brown we already knew could act. Lawrence Taylor is a pleasant surprise. He plays an old, broken-down linebacker facing the end of his career and his own personal demons. So basically, LT's playing himself. And he handles that very well.So the cast is generally excellent and the story's entertaining enough so why is there the nagging sense that the movie's not quite as good as it could have been? One problem is the football action. Stone takes you right onto the field, capturing the sound and fury. But he goes too far. Realism takes a back seat as we're presented with a lot of rather cartoonish football, guys doing full-twisting double somersaults into the end zone and such. The game is exciting enough as is, Stone didn't need to crank it up past the point of truth. And a lot of the off the field stuff goes a little too far as well. There's a lot of craziness and excess. Our on-field warriors are wild men off the field. A little too wild at times to take the movie seriously. And then there's the central plot point, Beamen's rise to instant superstardom. The media makes stars quickly but not that quickly. It's just not really believable. Coach D'Amato tells us football is a game of grabbing that last inch. Any Given Sunday comes close but when we stretch out the chains it comes up just that inch short.

The script is superb, one of the best courtroom dramas ever written, and Sidney Lumet could have done wonders with it, but it's in equally good hands with Rob Reiner - it's Reiner's last great film, and his only solid attempt at a straight drama. Reiner's skill is easily seen in the performances he drags out of his actors, both leads and small roles - A Few Good Men boasts a list of big-name decent actors, none of which is very versatile, but all are casted to perfection and do wonders with their parts Tom Cruise, Demi Moore, Kevin Bacon, Kiefer Sutherland, Kevin Pollack, J.T. Walsh, James Marshall (of Twin Peaks fame), Christopher Guest - all deliver perfectly. Also worthy of mention are as-of-yet unknown Noah Wyle and Cuba Gooding Jr.Then there's Jack Nicholson, whose role can be likened to that of Anthony Hopkins in Silence for the Lambs - with barely 15 minutes of actual screen time, he completely steals the show from everybody else. Nicholson gives a powerhouse of a performance, that renders the rest of the cast useless and pale. His scenes alone are reason enough to watch it - even if you despise courtroom dramas as a whole, and find the rest of the film utterly boring despite its slick and intelligent dialog and passionate, realistic acting, these few short minutes make A Few Good Men a cinema classic.

","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"23 September 2011","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Some movies just aren't as good as you remembered them when you were a kid. Others actually get better with age. The Lion King falls in the latter category.Based on the play Hamlet, The Lion King is the classic story of a young cub Simba, who is the son of the proud Mufasa. Simba eagerly wants to follow his father's footsteps and become a great king of the pride-lands like him - until tragedy strikes, which Simba blames himself for, and runs away from the pride-lands, where he befriends Timon and Pumba and follows their carefree Hakuna Matata way of life. However, he's about to learn that while you can't change the past, you can't run away run away from it either.If there is any animated film that could be considered epic, The Lion King would be a top contender. From start to finish, The Lion King is practically one great scene after another. The epic beginning, the trip to the elephant graveyard, Simba and his dad bonding, Scar's plan, the stampede, the tragedy, Nala finding Simba the romance between them, Simba confronting his father, his return to pride rock, his battle to reclaim the throne, and the ending; All of these could have been highlights of a lesser movie. Here, if I had to pick my favorite scene, I would just pick the whole movie.Not only that, but almost every aspect of the film is great. The story, as I said before, is classical with a great theme to it (face your responsibilities, don't run away from them) while the characters are just as good. I'm sure many kids can relate to the cub Simba, from him wanting to be just like his dad to him being so hyper active, waking up his parents before the sun even rises (something I used to recall doing when I was little) Even as an adult, Simba remains appealing (I'm sure deep down, a lot of us would just love to live a care and responsibility free life) Also, like the best of Disney's movies, we have a rich variety of supporting characters, from the prim and proper Zazu to the wise and kind of weird Rafiki the hilarious Timon and Pumba (normally, adding a warthog with a bad smell for humor would hurt such a dramatic story, and yet the filmmakers manage to get enough laughs out of Pumba without being too crude or hurting the story)The characters are helped by a great cast. Rather than simply going after big names, the filmmakers brought a talented cast that fit the characters perfectly.Matthew Broderick is extremely likable as Simba, while James Earl Jones gives off all the power, authority, fierceness, and occasional warmth as Mufasa, who is arguably one of the greatest dads in cinema. Too often, when making a tough fatherly figure, the filmmakers will give him a total lack of care or emotion, yet here, despite all his fierceness, Mufasa can still manage to feel like a big teddy bear when he plays with Simba. Jeremey Irons, meanwhile, is one seriously underrated actor, and here he shines as the cunning and conniving Scar. Whoopi Goldberg, Cheech Martin, Jim Cummings, Nathan Lane, Rowan Atkinson, and Robert Guillaume round off the rest of the incredible cast.The film is also incredibly heartfelt, with some truly touching scenes. Chief among them (those who don't want spoilers should skip to the next paragraph) is the tragic scene of the death of Mufasa. I've seen reviews that have compared that scene negatively to the death of the mother in Bambi, calling it secondhand compared to that scene. Personally, as a kid the death of Mufasa was much more upsetting to me than the death scene in Bambi. Nowawdays, I think both are powerful, but in two different ways. With Bambi, the tears comes from Bambi running through the forest calling for his mother, not even knowing she's dead. With The Lion King, the tears come from Simba seeing his dad lying there lifeless, and refusing to accept it. Him running around asking for someone to come help still brings tears to my eyes to this day.The score, meanwhile, is done by Hans Zimmer, who is one of my favorite composers, and the score for The Lion King is one of, if not his absolute best.

Others actually get better with age. The Lion King falls in the latter category.Based on the play Hamlet, The Lion King is the classic story of a young cub Simba, who is the son of the proud Mufasa. Simba eagerly wants to follow his father's footsteps and become a great king of the pride-lands like him - until tragedy strikes, which Simba blames himself for, and runs away from the pride-lands, where he befriends Timon and Pumba and follows their carefree Hakuna Matata way of life. However, he's about to learn that while you can't change the past, you can't run away run away from it either.If there is any animated film that could be considered epic, The Lion King would be a top contender. From start to finish, The Lion King is practically one great scene after another. The epic beginning, the trip to the elephant graveyard, Simba and his dad bonding, Scar's plan, the stampede, the tragedy, Nala finding Simba the romance between them, Simba confronting his father, his return to pride rock, his battle to reclaim the throne, and the ending; All of these could have been highlights of a lesser movie. Here, if I had to pick my favorite scene, I would just pick the whole movie.Not only that, but almost every aspect of the film is great. The story, as I said before, is classical with a great theme to it (face your responsibilities, don't run away from them) while the characters are just as good. I'm sure many kids can relate to the cub Simba, from him wanting to be just like his dad to him being so hyper active, waking up his parents before the sun even rises (something I used to recall doing when I was little) Even as an adult, Simba remains appealing (I'm sure deep down, a lot of us would just love to live a care and responsibility free life) Also, like the best of Disney's movies, we have a rich variety of supporting characters, from the prim and proper Zazu to the wise and kind of weird Rafiki the hilarious Timon and Pumba (normally, adding a warthog with a bad smell for humor would hurt such a dramatic story, and yet the filmmakers manage to get enough laughs out of Pumba without being too crude or hurting the story)The characters are helped by a great cast. Rather than simply going after big names, the filmmakers brought a talented cast that fit the characters perfectly.Matthew Broderick is extremely likable as Simba, while James Earl Jones gives off all the power, authority, fierceness, and occasional warmth as Mufasa, who is arguably one of the greatest dads in cinema. Too often, when making a tough fatherly figure, the filmmakers will give him a total lack of care or emotion, yet here, despite all his fierceness, Mufasa can still manage to feel like a big teddy bear when he plays with Simba. Jeremey Irons, meanwhile, is one seriously underrated actor, and here he shines as the cunning and conniving Scar. Whoopi Goldberg, Cheech Martin, Jim Cummings, Nathan Lane, Rowan Atkinson, and Robert Guillaume round off the rest of the incredible cast.The film is also incredibly heartfelt, with some truly touching scenes. Chief among them (those who don't want spoilers should skip to the next paragraph) is the tragic scene of the death of Mufasa. I've seen reviews that have compared that scene negatively to the death of the mother in Bambi, calling it secondhand compared to that scene. Personally, as a kid the death of Mufasa was much more upsetting to me than the death scene in Bambi. Nowawdays, I think both are powerful, but in two different ways. With Bambi, the tears comes from Bambi running through the forest calling for his mother, not even knowing she's dead. With The Lion King, the tears come from Simba seeing his dad lying there lifeless, and refusing to accept it. Him running around asking for someone to come help still brings tears to my eyes to this day.The score, meanwhile, is done by Hans Zimmer, who is one of my favorite composers, and the score for The Lion King is one of, if not his absolute best.

And to think that when I tried to watch it first, months ago, I gave up after a few minutes. But now I know better so I gave it another chance. This has to be one of the most philosophical flicks ever been shot, yet one which may lead you to confusion with its slick F\/X, superb settings & action packed scenes. The acting is appropriate by all involved. Fishburne and Weaving great in their parts and Reeves playing adequately low key his confused, doubtful, Neo. Moss great also, but I had trouble putting together her kick ass Amazon and her vulnerable, sensible girl. Now, Neo may be the hero here, the one around whom this whole universe turns, but from a tragic, pathetic POV there's one character more fascinating than him.Cypher is to me The Matrix most interesting character. He belongs to an exclusive club, which also includes JCS's Judas, Watchmen's Rorschach & Dark City's Shreber. He's Everyman, Average Joe. While Neo, Jesus, John, Jon, are stereotypes--good guys doing good--he's the one with the burden of having to make the hard choices--which may well be illusory after all. In JCS Judas follows Jesus until he realizes that Jesus has gone too far and then sets to stop him, even betraying him. It's only then that he realizes he is just a tool in God's hands. He never had the free will he thought he had. Rorschach fools himself when thinking that he chooses to die for ethical reasons when it's really for the horrors of the amorality in which he grew up. Cypher knows better; he knows that there's no such thing as free will (as many expert behaviorists believe too) but only instinctive reactions resulting from our environment, from genetic or cultural factors or from chemical reactions in our brains, etc. He takes Morpheus' teachings & turns them around. That's best shown in his scene with Smith, when the states who cares if the flavor of this steak is just a creation of the Matrix! All what I care about is having a tasty steak in my mouth. After all, it was Morpheus who said that there's no difference between a dream lasting a lifetime and reality. So it's all about searching for the pleasurable. Understandably so, Cypher hates him because he took him out of his state of ignorant bliss, his dream, and waked him up to an unpleasant reality. Horrible as it seems, if Morpheus had liberated all humans he'd have to face the wrath of many, or most, because we don't search for pure, freewill--filled reality in life but for simple happiness--even if everybody got their own interpretation for what than means, in many cases a twisted one--and that's what the Matrix was giving them, or something near. Neo, Morpheus may be the top guys here but it's Cypher the one reaching the heights of a truly Shakespearean hero.TM has a marvelous kaleidoscopic nature in it, as it can be matched with several constructs of human--or Western--culture. Everyone is aware of its Christian overtones, with humans having been banished to the Purgatory of their plastic cocoons after our original sin of destroying our natural environment--as Smith explains to M. Or it could be just Plato's cave. It may be also considered as a metaphorical attack on capitalism. Marx described it once as an economic system where all personal relations between its antagonist parts disappear--which wasn't even the case of slavery, feudalism. The capitalist exploits the worker just like any commodity, machine--he wrote. Smith says as much to M. we don't give a crap about you people; we just need your energy. Or you may prefer to see instead in it the old Zarathustrian theme of our search for our own inner Superman. Or perhaps it's just about rites of passage. Then again, maybe it's just the 7th art expressing our angst of seeing modern technology taking an increasingly dominant role in our lives--especially virtual simulations of reality.Greatly entertaining, whatever you may say about his numerous flaws--can you say 2nd Law of Thermodynamics? Still, the shocker for me was Neo waking up covered in plugs & tubes. That image gave me nightmares for days. No more space and anyway others have already delved on cinematography, FX and settings, all uber superb (but why everyone has gone green pale in their flicks lately?).In all, 8.0, mostly because I'm not quite sure it will stand the test of time.

He belongs to an exclusive club, which also includes JCS's Judas, Watchmen's Rorschach & Dark City's Shreber. He's Everyman, Average Joe. While Neo, Jesus, John, Jon, are stereotypes--good guys doing good--he's the one with the burden of having to make the hard choices--which may well be illusory after all. In JCS Judas follows Jesus until he realizes that Jesus has gone too far and then sets to stop him, even betraying him. It's only then that he realizes he is just a tool in God's hands. He never had the free will he thought he had. Rorschach fools himself when thinking that he chooses to die for ethical reasons when it's really for the horrors of the amorality in which he grew up. Cypher knows better; he knows that there's no such thing as free will (as many expert behaviorists believe too) but only instinctive reactions resulting from our environment, from genetic or cultural factors or from chemical reactions in our brains, etc. He takes Morpheus' teachings & turns them around. That's best shown in his scene with Smith, when the states who cares if the flavor of this steak is just a creation of the Matrix! All what I care about is having a tasty steak in my mouth. After all, it was Morpheus who said that there's no difference between a dream lasting a lifetime and reality. So it's all about searching for the pleasurable. Understandably so, Cypher hates him because he took him out of his state of ignorant bliss, his dream, and waked him up to an unpleasant reality. Horrible as it seems, if Morpheus had liberated all humans he'd have to face the wrath of many, or most, because we don't search for pure, freewill--filled reality in life but for simple happiness--even if everybody got their own interpretation for what than means, in many cases a twisted one--and that's what the Matrix was giving them, or something near. Neo, Morpheus may be the top guys here but it's Cypher the one reaching the heights of a truly Shakespearean hero.TM has a marvelous kaleidoscopic nature in it, as it can be matched with several constructs of human--or Western--culture. Everyone is aware of its Christian overtones, with humans having been banished to the Purgatory of their plastic cocoons after our original sin of destroying our natural environment--as Smith explains to M. Or it could be just Plato's cave. It may be also considered as a metaphorical attack on capitalism. Marx described it once as an economic system where all personal relations between its antagonist parts disappear--which wasn't even the case of slavery, feudalism. The capitalist exploits the worker just like any commodity, machine--he wrote. Smith says as much to M. we don't give a crap about you people; we just need your energy. Or you may prefer to see instead in it the old Zarathustrian theme of our search for our own inner Superman. Or perhaps it's just about rites of passage. Then again, maybe it's just the 7th art expressing our angst of seeing modern technology taking an increasingly dominant role in our lives--especially virtual simulations of reality.Greatly entertaining, whatever you may say about his numerous flaws--can you say 2nd Law of Thermodynamics? Still, the shocker for me was Neo waking up covered in plugs & tubes. That image gave me nightmares for days. No more space and anyway others have already delved on cinematography, FX and settings, all uber superb (but why everyone has gone green pale in their flicks lately?).In all, 8.0, mostly because I'm not quite sure it will stand the test of time.

And to think that when I tried to watch it first, months ago, I gave up after a few minutes. But now I know better so I gave it another chance. This has to be one of the most philosophical flicks ever been shot, yet one which may lead you to confusion with its slick F\/X, superb settings & action packed scenes. The acting is appropriate by all involved. Fishburne and Weaving great in their parts and Reeves playing adequately low key his confused, doubtful, Neo.

The film can now be appraised as what it is, an exercise in experimental filmmaking, and an interesting one at that. It takes a lesson from the true great classics of horror - in that the fear of the unknown, the anxiety and anticipation of violence are much more effective than explicit violence in itself - and indeed, it's scarier than almost any horror movie created in the last twenty years, although the teenagers who usually go for that kind of movie will probably disagree. The Blair Witch Project creates tension and anxiety, and draws the viewer into the characters' world. And it doesn't matter one bit whether or not you think it might be real - in fact it's more impressive when you know that it's not.Unfortunately, it doesn't achieve true greatness in that respect either. In its attempt to bridge between mainstream horror and experimental indie movie-making, the film reaches a sort of middle ground that isn't quite here nor there, not quite satisfying anybody.
