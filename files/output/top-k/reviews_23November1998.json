This is a low budget action film, I believe the budget was 8 million, and he makes it look like 60 million. I was never a big fan of Antonio Banderas until I saw him in this film. He has real screen power and it is fantastic to watch him use a gun. Rodriguez is as good as John Woo or Sam Peckinpah. This film is amazing. Salma Hayek alone is worth watching this movie.

While the movie may fall short on visual effects and treats, I realized that perhaps that is exactly what director Mimi Leder meant when she said this is not an action flick.When that idea finally registered in my mind, I focused on the characters. Though I can't really blame Leder for a somewhat inept script, surprisingly I give a lot of praise for the underrated Tea Leoni for her portrayal of the ambitious newsreporter Jenny.  By now you must know that this movie has quite a number of sub-plots, but I was drawn most to her character's disjointed relationship with her father.  I must admit that for me, the climax of the movie was when she met death face to face reunited with her father.  This brought an endless stream of tears into my eyes- knowing that the last words she said were simply, Daddy...This movie, when viewed at a certain frame of mind, certainly has the ability to hold a candle to its title. ","genre":null},{"date":"23 November 1998","score":"","review":"  If you are looking for a fast paced movie Meet Joe Black is not for you.  However, if you are looking for a good movie that is humorous and touching even though it deals realistically (even in farcial way) with the extremely serious subject of Death then this is the movie for you.  The movie takes its time and develops all the character well.  The dialogue is excellent and the supporting cast is very good, Mr. Pitt and Mr. Hopkins are great.  Mr. Pitt who plays Joe Black\/Death is the only actor I can think of who have played this part.  He is an excellent actor who plays the part of an attractive, both socially and physically with his boy next good looks, Death (Joe Black).  He is actually likeable in his innocence.  I can hardly say enough about him.  Mr. Hopkins who is certainly one of the best actors of 20th Century was excellent as well. The chemistry between the two is great, and I suspect that they like and respect each other off the set.  The movie is about three hours long but I did not notice until after.  If you like well written, well acted, good dialogue, and great characters then you will enjoy Meet Joe Black.  I would give this movie three plus stars and once again thank Mr. Pitt for an excellent performance.
