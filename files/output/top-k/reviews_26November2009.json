Seriously, thus this movie was horrible, the plot was weak and lame, and the movie is pointless. The actors also did a worthless job on their roles from start to finish thus the scripts too. The storyline is bad, the actors did dreadful, the animation was bad, but most of all, the script was a bad run-down groundhog. This is all like a bad rip-off or sequel to WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT that was definitely one of my most greatest movies as a child, it's like a WHO SOUGHT ROCKY AND BULLWINKLE. Watching this slut early in the morning was stupid, they're trying to make a rip-off of a good show and make it into a animation-life movie and it's just all stupid. Don't watch this Rocky & Bullwinkle, this one is bad. If you're bored and want to watch a true life and animated film, plan on and prepare to watch WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT, skip THE ADVENTURES OF ROCKY AND BULLWINKLE and move on.P^_^ ","genre":null},{"date":"26 November 2009","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Why does IMDb has a low rating too it, but everybody lies about they liked it?
