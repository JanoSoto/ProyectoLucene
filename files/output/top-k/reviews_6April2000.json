Billy Chapel (Kevin Costner) is a veteran pitcher with an accomplished career who is headed for the Hall of Fame.  On the day we meet him he has a lot on his mind.  He is informed that his team is being sold, he is being traded and the love of his life is moving to England.  Add to this the pain in his pitching arm, his impending decision on whether to retire and the fact that winning this game is critical in determining if the Yankees go to the playoffs, and you have a man with overloaded neurons.The story unfolds as an introspective retrospective.  As he is pitching this important game, he is thinking about his childhood, his relationship with Jane (Kelly Preston) and how he is going to get the next batter out.  He is so preoccupied that it doesn't even dawn on him until the eighth inning that there have been no Yankee hits and he has been pitching a perfect game. The flashback elements are expertly woven into the game, giving us a genuine feeling for his distraction.  This is a fresh perspective for a sports movie.  Instead of simply focusing on what the player is doing, the film focuses on what he is thinking while he is doing it.  It gives us an authentic look at how athletes get `in the zone', filtering out all the noise and concentrating totally on their performance.  Those who have been involved in athletic competition can identify with this state, although only the best can achieve it at will.Sam Raimi's direction on this film was excellent.  His direction of the love story was nothing special, but he did a superb job on the baseball scenes.  The combination of on the field action, commentary by Vin Scully and simulated TV telecast footage was so well done that it was impossible to differentiate it from a major league game in progress.The acting ranged from fair to excellent.  Kelly Preston was very good as Jane.  She brought a full range of emotional expression to the part, though she sometimes got a little shrill, like the scene in the hospital where she screams out `Is this America?  Is baseball still the national pastime.'  Overall though, she played the part of the torn lover very well.Kevin Costner is no great lead actor and it is hard to understand why he is so popular.  Perhaps it is his whiny lost boy charm that makes women want to mother him.  In the love story, he again presented as listless and uninspired.  But in the baseball scenes, he came alive.  In fact, in these scenes Costner was not acting so much as acting out.  He loves baseball and was obsessed with doing all his own baseball scenes.  He is a top notch athlete, so he really could throw a curveball and his fastball had plenty of pop.  His ability to portray a professional athlete in this instance was superlative, probably due to his having played the game scholastically.   So overall, I would have to rate his performance here as very good.John Reilly gets a very honorable mention as Chapel's catcher.  He was quietly supportive and unobtrusive, the way catchers usually are.  He portrayed intense desire in a demure and low key way without overacting.  It was a nice performance by an actor in a supporting role playing a baseball player in a supporting role.I love baseball and this was a great baseball movie so I rated it 8\/10.  Anyone who enjoys sports will probably enjoy this film.

Someone had to perform a complete HAMLET for posterity, and Branagh had the sense to fill it full of actors worth listening to.Shakespeare's plays were meant to be performed, not read. For modern performances, the plays are usually hacked to bits and truncated to fit contemporary attention-spans. Even his better plays, while wonderful, are not particularly cinematic unless they are handled by imaginative directors and actors who understand what they are saying.Branagh's greatest mistake was trying for epic grandeur.One reason HAMLET is superior to other plays is that it stays put. HAMLET is tightly confined to one place. In other Shakespeare plays characters wander lonely heaths, they gallivant through forests, they storm battlefields, they travel recklessly from town to town. The denizens of HAMLET are stuck in Elsinore. People come and go, but the play's only departure from the castle is to a graveyard.Branagh opens the play out somewhat by setting exteriors at the home of the Duke of Marlborough. For the most part, however, the play remains stage-bound. The famous mirror set is impressive at first, but it grows tiresome. It's like being stuck for four hours in a gaudy waiting-room. A few other little rooms exist in small scenes (Polonius' bedroom) but even the castle's nuthouse appears to be in the great, mirrored hall.Apart from his valiant attempt to make an epic out of non-epic material, Branagh does a creditable job. As with all his previous Shakespearean outings (notably HENRY V) Branagh had the sense to cast the movie with actors worth watching.Stand-out performances are by Derek Jacobi as Claudius (his and Branagh's acting styles are so similar they could be father and son rather than Hamlet's uncle. How long had Claudius been playing footsie with Gertrude?) The ghost requires a strong player, and Branagh plugged in Brian Blessed -- who, unfortunately, appears little-used since the ghost's part is vital but brief). Richard Briers plays Polonius as a smooth operator who has blundered into territory out of his ken. Always-reliable Charlton Heston plants his flag as the player king. Rufus Sewell is the first Fortinbras I've ever seen who actually seems integral to the plot. Nicholas Farrell set a new high mark for future Horatios.Though their parts seem almost unimportant in a four-hour version, Timothy Spall and Reece Dinsdale make a good team as Rosencrantz and Guildenstern -- two pleasant young men caught in an untenable squeeze between their king and a madman who can out-think them at every turn.Some of the casting choices are less than notable. Jack Lemmon, for instance. Didn't he used to be an *actor*? Has he ever heard of Shakespeare? The gravedigger, one of Shakespeare's clowns with nothing funny to actually say, requires a comedian; Billy Crystal is good enough, if a bit Bronx for Denmark. But Robin Williams' Osric is too far over the top. Branagh should have chosen an actor he could rein in.I will not quibble with Branagh's choice for notable actors in teensy parts. If he's going to show Reynaldo, Priam and Hecuba, he needs memorable actors. Gérard Depardieu can say Aye, my lord with the best of them. Ancient John Gielgud, unfortunately the last of the great actors of his generation (Olivier, Richardson, Redgrave, etc.) has no lines but he knows how to deliver a pratfall and die.As for Branagh himself, arguably the best actor of his generation, he twitches a little much. He seems to forget that, in film, less is more. His wonder at his father's ghost is a wee tad too pop-eyed, and all his other expressions are perhaps a trifle mannered. Like Fonda in Mister Roberts and Stewart in Harvey perhaps Branagh has played the part too many times to sustain any spontaneity. Still, he's a strong enough actor to hold one's attention for four hours, and the movie is dynamic so long as Branagh remains on-screen or only slightly off it.Where this movie fails is the curse suffered by every HAMLET. A ghostly murder story with intrigue within the castle and the threat of war from without, HAMLET the play builds to a frenzied climax -- and then Hamlet is packed off to England while the other characters carry on in Elsinore without him. Hamlet's departure knocks the play down and it never regains its energy. This is not Branagh's fault, but Shakespeare's. Not foreseeing movies, Shakespeare probably wrote this pause to give the actor playing Hamlet a well-earned breather.This means everything after Hamlet's confrontation with Claudius following The Mousetrap feels like denouement. The movie would have been better in two parts, HAMLET, and HAMLET II RETURN FOR VENGEANCE.In this HAMLET, Claudius slaps the prince. maybe Branagh should have altered the text to make Hamlet pull a shiv and dispatch Claudius there and then. It would have departed from fidelity to the play, but it would have improved the picture.If you're a fan of Shakespeare generally or HAMLET in particular, this movie is worth a viewing. If, like me, you are obsessed with HAMLET, it's a keeper you'll watch again and again. I'd like to say it's a movie where you'll discover something new every time you revisit it, but it's really a movie where you pretty much see everything worth seeing the first time around. Still, it's always lovely to hear so much Shakespeare recited by such a fine company of actors. Thank you, Kenneth, for making this possible.

In fact, I would say that it is among the best films ever made, in sci-fi, only second to 2001. The plot absolutely lacks contrivance. All the plot points develop how they would naturally. And there are great surprises throughout the film. Even if you haven't seen the film, you know about the chest-bursting scene. You probably saw it parodied dozens of times. But watch the scene where Ian Holm reveals his secret! That is one amazing scene! I actually saw the sequel first, so I kind of knew that secret, too, but it still shocked me. It was so well directed.Notice how the dialogue works. It never particularly draws attention to itself. It actually reminds me of Robert Altman, how he directed such movies as Nashville, where many characters are speaking at the same time, and nothing seems more or less important than anything else.

The Nostromo's design is so believable that I feel that I'm actually seeing a real space vehicle. The alien ship also beams with its spookiness.The characters are also extremely believable. They are so well written that even the first character who dies is completely developed. If you get the DVD, they actually created dossiers about each of the crew members. It also has extra scenes which round out the characters even more. I think Ripley is one of the most endearing characters in film history. Even in the last two sequels, which were visually interesting but not very well written or directed, Ripley held my interest. I teared up when she died at the end of 3. If they made a fifth one, I would go, no matter how terrible I knew it would be. The acting is also top-notch. Ian Holm, a great actor, gives one of his best performances here. I love the last scene that he is in. Truly a master. And of course Sigourney Weaver could have just as easily been nominated for an Oscar for her performance here as she was for Aliens. I wish she would make more movies. She's so talented.The most important part of a film, in my mind, is the mood. And boy, does Alien have one of the most genuinely spooky movies I've ever seen. Make sure you watch it after the sun has gone down. Also, watching it alone will help. The special effects are kind of cheap, but Scott knows this well enough. He only shows the alien for seconds at a time. Besides keeping us from seeing the shoddiness of those puppets, this technique makes the alien seem all the more creepy and mysterious. 10\/10, no doubt at all (BTW, the symbols all over the Nostromo are the same insignias as those of the Purina Dog Chow company) ","genre":"Horror, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"6 April 2000","score":"14 out of 17 people found the following review useful","review":"  There are a few effective concepts in action films which are used over and over again. Surviving the Game uses one which was over 60 years old when the movie was made and still works like a charm. Made in 1932, The Most Dangerous Game is a movie about a group of people who are hunted for sport. Over the years this concept has been successfully used in big films like John Woo's Hard Target (which premiered less than a year before this film) as well as in DTV-films like the Lorenzo Lamas-actioner Final Round.The formula works. Although these films rarely offer anything new (you pretty much know the ending before the film has even started), they are very entertaining if the hero is someone who you want to win and the villains are suitably evil. Surviving the Game fills this order and throws in some energetic action sequences directed by Ernest R. Dickerson (I also enjoyed his Bulletproof a lot).Ice-T is the hero here. When the film starts, he has no money, no family, no friends and is ready to kill himself. But when he receives a job as a hunting guide from a wealthy businessman (played by Rutger Hauer), he wants to put his life in order again. But after a good meal where Ice meets the rest of the hunters (including Gary Busey and Charles Dutton), the hunt begins and he suddenly realizes that he's the prey. Now, he must use all his strength and wit to survive.The cast is perfect. While there are no huge stars, these people know the genre and obviously had a great time filming this movie. And there isn't any fault in the production values either. There are beautiful sceneries, a good score by Stewart Copeland and some neat stunts. The script by Eric Bernt (Virtuosity, Romeo Must Die) creates some quite interesting villains and the dialogue, while not perfect, works reasonably well. Luckily Bernt knows that he's writing an action film and doesn't even try to include any deep relationships or hidden meanings in his script.At the end of the day, this is a good action film which is guaranteed to entertain a fan of this genre for 90 minutes. It's not the best action film ever but it's definitely above-average. This one gets an 8.

He used to be an action auteur (but I think he threw that completely away with Titanic). Aliens is a masterpiece of thrills. The set is so claustrophobic, it makes me shiver just thinking about it.

And the actress who plays Newt was one great child actor, every bit as good as Haley Joel Osment from The Sixth Sense.

Also, notice how every scene takes place from her point of view. In the special addition DVD, though, there is a scene added where we see the colony (actually, Newt's father) find the aliens. This is used to introduce the colony's situation and to introduce Newt, but it was an enormous mistake to reinsert this scene back into the film. It breaks the rhythym quite terribly. It is a particularly long and clunky scene in the first place. It was enough when Paul Reiser told us that there has been a colony on that asteroid for many years. The audience knows right away that something is going to happen there with the aliens which will make Ripley have to go there. Now, with this scene having been reinserted, when the soldiers enter the colony and find a single life-form moving around, we know it is Newt (since that first scene kept focusing in on her). There is no surprise as their used to be. It should have just been left as a supplemental scene. Bad, bad mistake. Of course, that scene could not ruin this great film.

Too old to remember what I once knew of Scottish history, and therefore entirely unaware of any historical inaccuracies which I've since heard others put forth, I saw only a long, lush, romantic, dramatic, cinematic war poem, the sort of thing that would have become required reading in English literature courses had it been created by a troubador a few centuries earlier.  It didn't even bother me that Mel Gibson, despite his usual exceptionally strong acting, was far too old for the hero's role.  I was enchanted and deeply moved.Let me also state my opinion that, no matter what, Braveheart is still a really good movie.  The sheer choreography of the battle scenes is superb and not to be missed.  Patrick McGoohan's performance is the best I've seen him do yet.  Most of the little glimpses we get of Sophie Marceau are lovely and memorable.  The only real criticisms I can make of this film rest on the length and on certain cliches which could have been avoided; there were a number of scenes that could have been trimmed to strengthen Braveheart's impact immensely, and the script was not always as strong as the point.  But these are small criticisms.  Watching Braveheart is like immersing yourself greedily in a thick historical novel.However, when I first saw Braveheart, I had never seen anything like it on film.  So over the course of the next few years, hungry for more rich widescreen epics spread over two cassettes, I watched and rewatched a lot of other films, as much David Lean and Akira Kurosawa as I could find.  The first movie I saw after Braveheart was Lawrence of Arabia, which I'd seen and loved before; then, at my boyfriend's instigation, I moved into Kurosawa with a vengeance, starting with Ran.  If my goal had been to keep loving Braveheart, this was probably my first mistake.Then my boyfriend, at my urging, bought the video of Braveheart, letterboxed and everything as all originally widescreen films should be.  A big Kurosawa fan, and someone who cannot seem to get enough of beautifully presented violent tragedy, I assumed my boyfriend would love Braveheart as much as I had.  This was my second mistake.  For had he not purchased this videotape, my third and most critical error of judgment would never have occurred.My third mistake took place a couple of weeks ago.  We held a little film party at our house, ostensibly to watch Monty Python movies with a bunch of our friends, ages ranging from early 20s to late 30s.  We first watched Monty Python and the Holy Grail, a brilliant and hilarious movie we all love dearly.  Then the people who don't like violent tragedies, even when beautifully presented, had to go home.  So the question arose, what should we watch next?For some reason, neither Monty Python's The Meaning of Life nor Life of Bryan, which we had rented just for the occasion, appealed to the remaining guests.  For some perverse reason which I can only attribute to too many margaritas, we all agreed to watch Braveheart.Like The Holy Grail, Braveheart attempts to portray life in medieval Britain as it might really have been, filth and all.  So the first time we snickered when we saw a dirty face, we suspected we were in trouble.  As soon as the first English soldier in a bullet-shaped helmet appeared to receive a thorough taunting, those of use who had seen Braveheart before knew at once that our love affair with the film was over.  It didn't take long for our small audience to begin screaming things at the screen such as, Come back and fight, you coward! or Not dead; in fact, I'm feeling a little better, or You don't frighten us, English pig dogs! or, worst of all, Naughty, naughty Zoot!I don't want to spoil Braveheart for others.  The purpose of this review is simply to put forth a warning.  And so I will not walk you through all the parallels we encountered, much to the detriment of Braveheart, from costume to character to event.  It would be unkind.  Nor will I go into a detailed analysis of the flaws of Braveheart versus the virtues of, say, Kagemusha.I would offer two warnings, though.  The first warning is that, if you love Braveheart and have not watched a lot of Kurosawa, go carefully into that rich domain.  Know that once you have seen Ran, with all its beautifully composed scenes, unique and perfect music, and careful, truly poetic editing, never again will you be able to look at Braveheart with the same respect. The second warning is much more obscure, probably a mistake others are not likely to make, but still...  If you love Braveheart, or if you want to love Braveheart, never ever screen it directly after screening Monty Python and the Holy Grail.

So over the course of the next few years, hungry for more rich widescreen epics spread over two cassettes, I watched and rewatched a lot of other films, as much David Lean and Akira Kurosawa as I could find.  The first movie I saw after Braveheart was Lawrence of Arabia, which I'd seen and loved before; then, at my boyfriend's instigation, I moved into Kurosawa with a vengeance, starting with Ran.  If my goal had been to keep loving Braveheart, this was probably my first mistake.Then my boyfriend, at my urging, bought the video of Braveheart, letterboxed and everything as all originally widescreen films should be.  A big Kurosawa fan, and someone who cannot seem to get enough of beautifully presented violent tragedy, I assumed my boyfriend would love Braveheart as much as I had.  This was my second mistake.  For had he not purchased this videotape, my third and most critical error of judgment would never have occurred.My third mistake took place a couple of weeks ago.  We held a little film party at our house, ostensibly to watch Monty Python movies with a bunch of our friends, ages ranging from early 20s to late 30s.  We first watched Monty Python and the Holy Grail, a brilliant and hilarious movie we all love dearly.  Then the people who don't like violent tragedies, even when beautifully presented, had to go home.  So the question arose, what should we watch next?For some reason, neither Monty Python's The Meaning of Life nor Life of Bryan, which we had rented just for the occasion, appealed to the remaining guests.  For some perverse reason which I can only attribute to too many margaritas, we all agreed to watch Braveheart.Like The Holy Grail, Braveheart attempts to portray life in medieval Britain as it might really have been, filth and all.  So the first time we snickered when we saw a dirty face, we suspected we were in trouble.  As soon as the first English soldier in a bullet-shaped helmet appeared to receive a thorough taunting, those of use who had seen Braveheart before knew at once that our love affair with the film was over.  It didn't take long for our small audience to begin screaming things at the screen such as, Come back and fight, you coward! or Not dead; in fact, I'm feeling a little better, or You don't frighten us, English pig dogs! or, worst of all, Naughty, naughty Zoot!I don't want to spoil Braveheart for others.  The purpose of this review is simply to put forth a warning.  And so I will not walk you through all the parallels we encountered, much to the detriment of Braveheart, from costume to character to event.  It would be unkind.  Nor will I go into a detailed analysis of the flaws of Braveheart versus the virtues of, say, Kagemusha.I would offer two warnings, though.  The first warning is that, if you love Braveheart and have not watched a lot of Kurosawa, go carefully into that rich domain.  Know that once you have seen Ran, with all its beautifully composed scenes, unique and perfect music, and careful, truly poetic editing, never again will you be able to look at Braveheart with the same respect. The second warning is much more obscure, probably a mistake others are not likely to make, but still...  If you love Braveheart, or if you want to love Braveheart, never ever screen it directly after screening Monty Python and the Holy Grail.  Oh, sure; should you disregard this warning, you will certainly have fun.  Rolling around on the floor and laughing until you hurt is generally enjoyable.

No matter how many times A STREET CAR NAMED DESIRE is remade it always goes back to the characters, not the actors who portrayed them.  Audiences will keep going back to the same play or film each time it is recast to see the subtle difference the recasting will change the role.  That is why film versions of hit Broadway plays can be so successful.  Remaking a TV sitcom is different.  The new cast is not portraying the characters as originally written, they are portraying the actors' characterizations.  So in films like THE BEVERLY HILLBILLIES we are treated to what is essentially a Saturday Night Live style parody.  Of course, some of the best SNL skits are parody and it is fun to watch when done well (impressions done well, and of course a good sense of poking fun at a beloved show).

Yes, I'd heard lots of times about how excellent and scary it was, but I had never rented it, I don't know why (Nor I have seen any of the sequels). Then, it popped up on TV and, of course, I wouldn't miss the oportunity.Sure, I knew that there had been lots and lots of imitations and ripoffs of the plot, and I'd seen some of them, but I was expecting to see the origin of the clichés, and if I wasn't surprised, I hoped to be entertained and pleased at least.What a big disappointment.Halloween, the highly acclaimed Halloween, turned to be, at least in my opinion, a dull and very little scary slasher flick (even if this is THE ORIGINAL slasher flick) with cardboard characters I didn't care for (even if I had always heard about how well-constructed Laurie and Dr. Loomis were), and a killer who has no motivation and is no understandable (unlike Freddy Krueger, who, at least, had a reason to kill, and I won't say anything else because I don't wanna spoil 'A Nightmare on Elm Street'. If you've seen it, you know what I mean). I have read that Michael has one reason to go after Laurie, and it will be known in the sequels, but what about the other people he kills? What about Annie and the others? That's not the best type of movie killer for me.Plus, this movie spawned evil. It invented the killer that won't die no matter how hard you kick him or how many times you shot him between his eyes. I'm FED UP with this kind of character, I don't remember the first time I saw it, but I always hated it.Now, you'll want to know If this guy doesn't like Halloween, what kind of horror does he like? Well, if you're thinking that I can like modern teenage horror, you can't be further from true. I really HATE modern day horror, beautiful teenagers being stabbed as should be the screenwriter, as in I Know What You Did... or the godawful Urban Legend. And all that stuff came from Halloween. The only modern horror movie I actually liked was The Blair Witch Project, and it's far from being a classic, but at least it's original (yes, I know, so was Halloween, but Blair Witch works better for me). The horror I really like is the psychological one (like The Shining) or the strongly suspenseful and atmospherical one (like Psycho), but I like most kinds of scary movies. I loved The Birds, The Changeling, The Exorcist, Carrie, and lots and lots of more or less well-known movies, while I didn't like others like Poltergeist or this one. About slasher, I'd pick the original Nightmare on Elm Street, which is no masterpiece in itself but it's great scary fun, as a way better slasher movie than this one. And in the filmography of John Carpenter there are way better examples of the horror genre. For example, the highly underrated The Fog, which I absolutely loved and most people despise for not being so scary as Halloween. And, about the music, Carpenter himself has made better scores, like 'Assault on Precinct 13' and my favorite, 'Escape from NY'. The Halloween score is too reiterative (if not nearly as bad as the 'They Live' one).Overall, I don't think Halloween is a total piece of junk, it had its moments if you don't ask for too much, but it's maybe the most overrated movie ever, even more than Star Wars. Maybe, like Star Wars, you had to be a kid or teenager in the 70s to love them. Don't know.

If you've seen it, you know what I mean). I have read that Michael has one reason to go after Laurie, and it will be known in the sequels, but what about the other people he kills? What about Annie and the others? That's not the best type of movie killer for me.Plus, this movie spawned evil. It invented the killer that won't die no matter how hard you kick him or how many times you shot him between his eyes. I'm FED UP with this kind of character, I don't remember the first time I saw it, but I always hated it.Now, you'll want to know If this guy doesn't like Halloween, what kind of horror does he like? Well, if you're thinking that I can like modern teenage horror, you can't be further from true. I really HATE modern day horror, beautiful teenagers being stabbed as should be the screenwriter, as in I Know What You Did... or the godawful Urban Legend. And all that stuff came from Halloween. The only modern horror movie I actually liked was The Blair Witch Project, and it's far from being a classic, but at least it's original (yes, I know, so was Halloween, but Blair Witch works better for me). The horror I really like is the psychological one (like The Shining) or the strongly suspenseful and atmospherical one (like Psycho), but I like most kinds of scary movies. I loved The Birds, The Changeling, The Exorcist, Carrie, and lots and lots of more or less well-known movies, while I didn't like others like Poltergeist or this one. About slasher, I'd pick the original Nightmare on Elm Street, which is no masterpiece in itself but it's great scary fun, as a way better slasher movie than this one. And in the filmography of John Carpenter there are way better examples of the horror genre. For example, the highly underrated The Fog, which I absolutely loved and most people despise for not being so scary as Halloween. And, about the music, Carpenter himself has made better scores, like 'Assault on Precinct 13' and my favorite, 'Escape from NY'. The Halloween score is too reiterative (if not nearly as bad as the 'They Live' one).Overall, I don't think Halloween is a total piece of junk, it had its moments if you don't ask for too much, but it's maybe the most overrated movie ever, even more than Star Wars. Maybe, like Star Wars, you had to be a kid or teenager in the 70s to love them. Don't know.

I bought it right away on VHS, and when I got DVD, it was the only VHS tape I replaced with a DVD.So why is it the best film ever made? Simply because it transcends narrative. No other film has really done that. Even surrealist films are rooted in narrative. Avant-guarde films sometimes do not use narrative, but they become only moving paintings. 2001 has narrative, but it never insists on it. It lovingly displays the amazing visuals. The narrative itself makes me feel that humanity could be so much more. Kubrick usually is kind of pessimistic, but at the end of 2001, he shows Dave's transcendence. And he is moving towards Earth to bring the rest of humanity with him. Although it shows the state of humanity as it exists now as violent and unsympathetic to the plight of others, it shows hope for our future. I have a rather large complaint about how some people look at this film, though. The introductory comment to this film on this site mentions understanding it more since that person has read the novel. This is all misinformation! Kubrick was inspired by the Clarke short story The Sentinal, which I have read. It is not really worth it. If you've ever seen Clarke on The Discovery Channel's Mysteries of the Unknown or whatever it's called, you know how pompous he is. The visions in 2001 are completely Kubrick's. Arthur C.

Well, I contend that not all sequels suck- in fact, a few even improve upon the originals, like the classic Evil Dead 2 Dead by Dawn. Technically, I suppose Evil Dead 2 is more of a remake of The Evil Dead than a real sequel, as it starts out from a fresh beginning with one returning character, the amazing Ash (as played by the amazing Bruce Campbell). Ash ends up trapped in the woods by an unseen demonic force that turns his traveling companions into laughing, maniacal ghouls. For most of the movie Campbell pulls off a one man show, fighting the possessed house, his girlfriend's severed head, even his own hand in an amazing performance full of slapstick and character. Eventually more characters show up, including a love interest for Ash who sports some of the ugliest socks I've ever seen. This is an amazing, one of a kind movie. It is relentlessly clever, throwing one great idea after another on screen (the only disappointment is the final, climactic appearance of the demon, which isn't very scary). It's got way more personality than the first one, as well as better make-up and a great sense of humor. The Ash character appeared in another movie after this, Army of Darkness which is a totally different kind of movie than this  (a comedy\/adventure set in medieval times), but still recommended.

It's got way more personality than the first one, as well as better make-up and a great sense of humor. The Ash character appeared in another movie after this, Army of Darkness which is a totally different kind of movie than this  (a comedy\/adventure set in medieval times), but still recommended.

Well, I contend that not all sequels suck- in fact, a few even improve upon the originals, like the classic Evil Dead 2 Dead by Dawn. Technically, I suppose Evil Dead 2 is more of a remake of The Evil Dead than a real sequel, as it starts out from a fresh beginning with one returning character, the amazing Ash (as played by the amazing Bruce Campbell). Ash ends up trapped in the woods by an unseen demonic force that turns his traveling companions into laughing, maniacal ghouls. For most of the movie Campbell pulls off a one man show, fighting the possessed house, his girlfriend's severed head, even his own hand in an amazing performance full of slapstick and character.

He along with his team of deputies filled the film with lots of action and suspense.  The close encounters between Gerard and Richard Kimball (Harrison Ford) kept you on the edge of your seat.  The crew of the film did an excellent job as well.
