One late night on the 4th of July, the teens are partying and driving recklessly along a cliff side near the ocean, when they accidentally hit a fisherman walking across the road. In fear and confusion, they dump the body off a secluded dock and vow to never speak of it again. But the following summer, they begin to get strange letters and people within the small ocean-side community begin to die. It seems that someone knows what happened that night one year ago. Their friendships torn apart after the gruesome accident, the distanced group of once-close friends come together to try and discover the killer's identity, before they become his victims.Honestly, I really enjoyed this movie. After Scream, a whole slew of mediocre to bad slasher movies were released in the '90s, and out of all of them, this is definitely one of the better ones. It's loosely based on Lois Duncan's novel (which I have read), and is much, much different than the actual book was. The writers obviously re-worked the story quite a bit, and while it's nothing like the original story, it is still pretty decent. The novel revolved around some teenagers who accidentally killed a young boy on a bicycle, so this film was quite loosely based on the book. The film has some surprisingly good performances from a slew of upcoming teen actors, including Jennifer Love Hewitt as our lead, Sarah Michelle Gellar as her best friend, and Ryan Phillippe and Freddy Prinze Jr. as their boyfriends. The acting was much better than you'd expect. I'd also like to make not of some great chase sequences that occur in this movie as well. The killer in this film wields a sharp fishing hook (which is a rather original choice for a murderer's weapon) and a creepy, black rain slicker topped with a hat that covers his face - a rather original but menacing costume for a horror villain. The violence isn't gratuitous either - this film does make an attempt to become more of a psychological slasher film than most of them. The New England fishing-town atmosphere works well here, too.Overall, I Know What You Did Last Summer is a pretty good slasher movie, considering when it was released and the slew of slashers that were put out during the '90s. It's clichéd in some instances and isn't nearly perfect, but in the world of slasher films, it's a class act. 7\/10.

The animation is outstanding, not only are the hand-drawn cartoons rich and detailed with the use of very striking colours but the CGI is incredible as well. The way the Beast has been created that guards the Cave of Wonders looks so real and sinister that it transported me into an entirely different world just sitting in my bedroom and watching it on the telly. It's surprising that it was never shown at IMAX cinemas, but then again, this was 1992 and I shouldn't think IMAX was around then. There is not a single sign of boredom, silliness, cruelty or any other bad points in a film, it's fantastic all over. The characters and the natures of the characters were very well considered and put into deep thought. Aladdin is a carefree young man who is poor and homeless who seems happy and perhaps the sort of boy who is up-to-no-good sometimes but deep down there is a feeling of insecurity and we are able to see how sad he really is. Jasmine has an incredibly strong mind (for a Disney Princess at least) and loses her temper quite easily but deep down she is sick and tired of having her life lived for her and with these two things, she is charming and rather funny. Jafar is quite different to ordinary Disney villains who'd normally yell I'll get you yet! Ha-ha-ha! He's dark and mysterious and witty with it, looking at him he looks like he's psychologically poorly when he plots evil schemes and people like that need medical help not being banged up in jail for god's sake! Think how hard it must be for them! I'm sure he's insecure too, at heart. The Genie has got to be the funniest supporting character Disney has ever come up with. Robin Williams, I have to say, was the perfect choice for this bundle of giant, hilarious fun. The Genie looked as if he'd gone a bit off his rocker in some scenes - but that's all the better. Irritating Aladdin, in one or two sequences, had me in hysterics, dressing up as pretty ladies and funny-looking men was side-splitting comedy and there are lots more gags from the Genie that'll always leave me giggling after the film. The Sultan is a rather eccentric, gullible character who tries to find Jasmine her perfect match but doesn't seem to be doing very well as she gets it clear to him that she wants to make her own choice of man, and he also, is very funny, especially when he pinches Aladdin's cheek and a slobbery kind of sound comes from out his mouth. The storyline is very interesting. A golden lamp is hidden in a mysterious cave but only one person may make their entrance and Jafar, to his dismay, is not that person. Who could it be? You guessed it! It's Aladdin! Jasmine escapes her Arabian palace so that she can lead her own life and then accidentally bumps into Aladdin, the man she truly loves. The palace guards arrest Aladdin and Jafar lies to a heartbroken Jasmine that he thought that the street-boy captured her against her will and he has already been put to death. Jafar dresses as an old beggar and takes Aladdin to the cave and promises him a grand reward if he fetched the magic lamp. Aladdin soon becomes trapped in the cave and now he has the chance to find out what is so special about this old, dented lamp - a big genie with a massive personality will answer that question! But despite the fact that his plan has failed Jafar is not going to give up getting his hands on the lamp! Soon enough Aladdin is powerless to put constant stops to Jafar's schemes. If Fantasia took you on a breathtaking adventure then you really ought to soar away from the normal world with this incredible film-experience. This is just too good to miss!

","genre":"Action, Crime, Drama"},{"date":"11 July 2006","score":"5 out of 7 people found the following review useful","review":" It might be sad to sit back nowadays and reflect on the decline of Kevin Costner's career, but back in the '80s and even the early '90s he was a personable leading man whose films were generally enjoyable. Take this sporting drama from John (WarGames) Badham, for instance. American Flyers is an enjoyable cycling drama from the pen of Steve Teisch, in which the gruelling hardships of professional cycle-racing is combined with a story about two brothers rediscovering each other. There's also a key plot point about a hereditary disease which may or may not affect one of the brothers. The story is never hugely engrossing, but it serves its purpose insofar that it gets the audience interested in the relationship between the two siblings, and provides a fairly exciting climax in which one of them has the chance to win a gruelling race.Lazy David Sommers (David Marshall Grant) lives in St. Louis and spends his days watching kung fu movies, dating girls, and riding his bike. His brother Marcus (Kevin Costner) is a more successful and motivated type, who works in a high-tech gym as a sports physician. The brothers lost their father to a hereditary illness, and Marcus is quite worried that David may have the same problem. Marcus persuades David to come into the gym and undergo some medical and physical tests. The results seem OK, and a relieved Marcus invites David to join him in competing in a gruelling bike race in the Rocky Mountains, aptly named Hell Of The West. The guys are joined by their respective girlfriends, in Marcus's case Sarah (Rae Dawn Chong) and in David's case Becky (Alexandra Paul).

The World is not Enough, the last Bond movie of the 90s certainly seemed to prove this point, being arguably one of the strongest installments of the franchise ever made. Director Michael Apted proves to be an inspired choice, as he brings out a darker, more emotional side to Bond while still maintaining the light hearted, underlyingly comical feel of the series... not an easy feat to balance the two, but Apted pulls it off with considerable skill and ease. Despite some story elements seeming like they should be too overtly fantastical (a villain impervious to pain) instead don't seem unbelievable at all, and only serve to give the story an added edge. The World is Not Enough also serves as much more of a thinker than the gratuitous action feel of the franchise, with more difficult ethical dilemmas, not to mention elements such as personality disorder Stalkholm syndrome for viewers to mull over. The notion that Bond is less of a superhero and more of a real man, with actual difficult decisions to make and real emotional consequences to suffer comes into play much more prominently than in any other 007 film, for which Apted and screenwriters Neil Purvis, Robert Wade and Bruce Feirstein should be commended for, as well as turning out one of the absolute best Bond scripts to date. Do not be deceived into thinking that the film suffers in the action department due to the more serious, emotional storyline - fear not, this is still, after all, a James Bond movie, so there are still explosions, gunfights, chases and romance aplenty. Apted has also shown his stripes as a superior action film director with such memorable setpieces as attack on a caviar factory by helicopters with giant sawblades dangling from them, a huge confrontation aboard a nuclear submarine, and an explosive ski chase down snowy mountainsides - more than enough to keep the most action sated viewer well entertained for their 2 hours. On the whole, The World is Not Enough also sports one of the most impressive rounds of acting ever seen in a James Bond movie. Brosnan gives arguably his finest performance as Bond here, and it shows well that rather than coasting along on the role, each performance he has been discovering new aspects to the character, and adding to it to improve his performance. His Bond is much less cavalier and more serious and realistic here, with more of a ruthless cruel streak than usual - an excellent performance for which he deserves far more credit than he is bound to be granted. Sophie Marceau also proves to be easily the most complex and intriguing Bond girl to date with her exquisite performance as Elektra King, the troubled daughter and heiress to an extensive oil pipeline. Robert Carlyle is also one of the most menacing and memorable villains of the Bond movies, and in recent action movies at all. His Renard is not merely a homicidal terrorist, but also a fractured and seriously disturbed and reflective man, balancing the menacing overtones with a philosophical streak, making him a truly compelling villain. The film also builds a much larger character for M, Bond's boss, and it gives Dame Judi Dench to show what an incredibly fine actress she is - her normally hard as rocks demeanor is shattered by wonderfully portrayed feelings of uncertainty and guilt, and Dench brings M to life with a passion never before seen. It's also great to see Scottish actor Robbie Coltrane reprise his Russian mobster character Valentin Zukovsky, and he gives yet another wonderful performance in the role, this time under the pretense of being a legitimate businessman. It is also unbearably tragic to see Desmond Llewelyn give his final performance as gadget guru Q, but his last time inhabiting the role proves to be one of his best performances on record, and John Cleese enters the scene in a brief cameo as Q's second in command, and proves to be a fine replacement for the beloved gadgetmaster. There is, in fact, only one real weakness to the film, and she answers to the name Denise Richards. While Richards may easily look the part of a Bond girl, however hard she tries, the poor woman simply cannot demonstrate acting talent anywhere close to matching her looks. At best she seemed to be reading her lines in a monotone off cue cards, sticking out embarrassingly in an otherwise incredibly quality film. Overall, the World is Not Enough is one of the strongest, and most complex Bond films to date, without sacrificing the entertainment value, which is there, strong as ever, as well as giving the viewer something genuine to think over... a rare feat for 007. For any Bond fans, or fans of well made, quality action movies with a little something more to think over, The World is Not Enough is one of the best films on the market - definitely worth a viewing.-9\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"11 July 2006","score":"5 out of 10 people found the following review useful","review":" The World is Not EnoughIt would seem that rather than slowly fading away over time, James Bond films only continued to improve in film-making quality and sheer entertainment value as time passed.

I have a ton of reviews and never got around to reviewing one of my very favorite films. While I know you can't really say which movie is best, I really can't think of another film off the top of my head that is better. I can easily see how it made the top 250 and think it would probably be rated a lot higher if it had come out recently--as the 250 is very much skewed towards newer films.I think the biggest reason I love the film is the casting. While Frederic March and Dana Andrews were genuine stars at the time, they were not huge names like Gable, Stewart or Grant. I love these three actors but think the film benefited from March (who was no longer the handsome matinée idol he'd been in the 30s) and Andrews (who played an everyman-type guy in most of his films). Plus, the genius of casting Harold Russell as the third returning serviceman cannot be minimized. While I hate movies that patronize the handicapped (I have a deaf daughter and cringe at patronizing), Russell's performance was anything but and was amazingly honest and powerful--earning him a very well-deserved special Oscar for his performance, not his disability. The family and friends of these men also worked out so very well. I just can't say enough positive about it.And, of course, the choice of actors and the type performance they gave was due in large part to William Wyler--my vote as the greatest director ever. Why he is not recognized as every bit the genius that Fellini, Bergman, Hitchcock, Kurosawa or Kubrick were, I don't know (actually, I think he was far better than all these directors with the exception of Kurosawa, but that's a discussion for another place). If you don't believe me about his genius, do an IMDb search on the films he made--no other director comes close in the sheer number of great films. Plus, watch the film at least two or three times and you'll notice all the fantastic scenes--wonderful camera shots (like the ones in the nosecone of the airplane) or scenes involving real people (such as the one with Harold Russell with his fiancé as she tucks him into bed--I am fighting off tears now just thinking about it).This film also has an unbelievable script--pure, real and captivating throughout! A film about returning war vets could have been trite or jingoistic, but this one maintains it dignity and humanity throughout. I challenge you to watch this and not be impressed. Unless you are a member or Al-Qaeda or a 100% America-hater, you will be hooked.

This is in reference to the hunt provided by the utterance of the word Rosebud by the lead character Charles Foster Kane that gushed forth the investigation of a group of journalists regarding the mystery behind this last word of his. This film is very rich in symbolisms. Some of which are the following 1)The sled which had the word Rosebud on it was the symbol of the great fortune that entered his life which he, on the other hand, greatly despised in the end. It also stood for the naivety he lost as a child and the joy that only his real family could've brought him. 2)The crystal ball that had a winter scene inside it which he dropped upon losing his very last breath, on the other hand, was the symbol of the poor yet happy life he was born into. 3)In the scene where he was told that he had lost his position, he was seen descending the spiral staircase. It was a great shot from the top of the stairs that symbolized his life or rather, his career spiraling downward. 4)In the scene where he was finally turning over his empire, he stood by a very tall window. It was shot from a distance accentuating how small Kane is compared to the grand height of the window. I thought it symbolized 2 things The tall window was his empire getting bigger than ever and him shrinking into this very small individual losing grip of the things he once had. 5)The film opened with a very dark and gloomy Xanadu which after seeing the whole film made me realize that it must have been a symbol of Kane's life at that point- nearing its end and extracted of the beautiful things it once had. 6)Lastly, one of the last few scenes of the film was a gliding shot from the top of his things (mostly in boxes) lined outside Xanadu ready for disposal. At first glance, I thought it was a view of NYC from the top. When I realized it was actually a shot of Kane's things ready for disposal, I thought that maybe it was another symbolism offered by this great film. Perhaps of the great city he thrived and succeeded in now already distant from his reach if not LOST from him already. Orson Welles being the producer, lead actor and director of this film proved to many that such great efforts are duly given great responses. This film, as what many of us might know already, is considered as one of the greatest if not THE greatest film ever made by seasoned movie critics and ordinary moviegoers alike. I, however, have not yet seen that many movies yet for me to make the same conclusion although I did witness for myself the greatness that this film is. The film enthusiast that I am, I am waiting to see more great films like Lawrence of Arabia, Gone with the Wind, Out of Africa, A Streetcar named Desire and many more of these great films tagged as such by movie critics all over the globe. Only after seeing these other films could I believe it right to finally make the conclusion regarding which is the best and perhaps, which also is the worst (that is, if there actually is one). As of the moment, I could only speak well of Citizen Kane which I was thankful to have finally seen. Aside from the great mystery and many symbolisms it offers, I second the motion that this film did break new grounds for storytelling in film as it started with the ending, told the story through a series of flashbacks and ended with where it started focusing, in particular, on the NO TRESPASSING sign on Xanadu's tall gate. I would say that this film requires deep thinking on and perhaps, appreciation of the subtexts and rich symbolisms it has for its viewers. Another merit that should be rightly given to this film are for its achievements in special visual effects- the mirror scene after Susan Alexander left Kane where the latter stood parallel to a life-sized mirror showcasing a fantastic shot of several Kanes, the ridiculously huge fireplace in the similarly ridiculously huge mansion and the many other eye-pleasuring scenes showcased through exceptional camera shots and angles. All in all, Citizen Kane is a truly astounding achievement in film-making and a thought-provoking masterpiece in the field of storytelling.

After assaulting a superior officer at a function where he is obviously drunk, he is demoted to a position where he is less able to inflate his ego, causing him to slip into late-stage addiction. Sunday's wife Gwen, played by Charlize Theron, is the more obvious drunk but, in recognition of more destructive behaviors, complains about his drinking on their anniversary. He's finally forced into rehab and, while still somewhat cocky and undergoing ego deflation (it doesn't happen overnight), ends up paying a heartfelt amends to Brashear.One review mentions alcoholism When his diving career is cut short, Sunday turns to drink and ends up in rehab. More accurately, When his diving career was cut short, Sunday could no longer effectively inflate his ego, resulting in a spiral down into more obvious late-stage alcoholism. Alcoholism is, in fact, the driving force behind the key obstacles Brashear encounters men who have a need to wield capricious power. Fortunately, Brashear succeeds against all odds. It's a pleasure to recommend Men of Honor not only as an inspiring motion picture with great acting by great actors, but also one that accurately represents alcoholism, a very rare event.

After Glen Or Glenda? failed to attract any offers of big-studio financing, Ed financed this entire film himself and filmed it entirely without oversight. The fact that he was clearly less than competent to do all of these tasks himself utterly failed to dissuade anyone involved from seeing the thing through to completion, and the result is that we have this cinematic turkey to laugh at for all time. Wood, bless him, was so enthusiastic about making films that he never bothered to try and learn his craft or test his ideas to see if they would work in the finished product. As a consequence, all of his effects are symbolic, and utterly laughable. When he wants a character to manipulate lab equipment, he will direct an actor to wildly gesticulate in front of a set that looks like a random collection of dials and lights stuck to a board. Making it all the funnier is that his actors are so clueless to his incompetence, or so captivated by his imagination, that they deliver a stupefyingly earnest performance.The plot of Bride Of The Monster is as ridiculous as anything else to have been written by Ed Wood, but in a sort of charming way, it works. The documentary Flying Saucers Over Hollywood explains in some segments that Wood's best-known work, Plan 9 From Outer Space, is widely watched because in addition to the reputation it has as a completely insane film, it also has a smattering of legitimately effective scenes or shots. That is definitely the case with Bride Of The Monster. Scenes like Bela Lugosi's I have no home speech, or Loretta King's quick chat with the file clerk, demonstrate a knack for composition and spacing that would have served Wood quite well if he had been able to reign in his apparent belief in shooting everything in one take, even if that take shows the set wobbling. Another quote about Plan 9 that definitely applies here is that no matter what time you watch Bride Of The Monster at, it always feels as if you are sitting in front of your television at four in the morning.Lugosi plays a mad scientist named Eric Vornoff, who is attempting to create a super-strength zombie through the use of a table, some straps, a powerful lamp, and some kind of electric play-toy. In the swamp around his mansion, people have been going missing with alarming regularity, prompting a detective to poke his nose into the area's goings-on. Contrary to the impression given by Tim Burton's biopic, Tony McCoy is not that bad an actor, although you will not be surprised to learn he only ever acted in one film and a TV episode after Bride Of The Monster. In fact, the acting in this particular film is much better than is usually the case for Wood productions, although that is not saying a lot. Loretta King speaks all of her lines as if she is reading from cue cards, and Dolores Fuller makes it plainly obvious she would rather be anywhere but on the office set. But the real prize for bad acting comes from George Becwar as Professor Vladimir Strowski, who has the apparent objective of taking Vornoff home by any means necessary. Whether Vornoff likes it or not. If one ever needed proof that Bela Lugosi was the most talented person to cross Ed Wood's path, this scene is it.Wood's enthusiasm for incorporating stock footage into his films both benefits and hinders him this time. The octopus stock footage is blended with his footage of what is clearly an octopus dummy to an effect that is both hilarious and rather sad. Watching Bela Lugosi battle with an octopus that he is clearly moving himself is enough to make one feel pretty sorry for the old guy. Exactly why producer Donald McCoy felt the need to end the film with a nuclear explosion is anyone's guess, but Wood obliges him with stock footage that not only doesn't come close to matching the rest of the film, but also raises the question of how our heroes survived. Wood's problem as a director was not so much that he was incompetent or had ambitions too great for his ability. No, his real problem was that he was utterly blind to when his stock footage or effects shots simply were not working. A good filmmaker like Verhoeven or Lucas would arrange their shots and editing to either cover their mistakes or let the audience's imagination take over. Wood just showed his blunders, warts and all.Amazingly, Bride Of The Monster achieved financial success when first released to theatres in 1955. Combined with Wood's documented excessive enthusiasm, this does a lot to explain why Wood was so enthusiastic to get another film in production. Although he made two short films between this and Plan 9, it took another two years for him to get what was then a feature-length film wrapped. That's another peculiarity of Wood's productions - none of them reached so much as a ninety minute length. In today's film-making world where studios will insert excessive scenes just to get a film up to an unspoken minimum length, nobody will ever accuse Wood's of outlasting their welcome. And that is probably one of the saddest things about Wood's story. Even though he never fit into the system in place during the 1950s, he would have even more difficulty fitting into the studio system of today. He dared to take on subjects that others considered taboo, and wasn't made creatively impotent by focus group meetings.I gave Bride Of The Monster a one out of ten. It is incompetent on every level, yet so endearing. Watch it with a group of friends, make it a MST-style night, and you will have a blast.

This movie is right up there with the very best and most entertaining adventurous WW II movies. The sentence; 'they don't make them like this anymore', certainly applies here.The movie has a wonderful adventurous and heroic story about a small group of Allied soldiers who are send on a mission to destroy two enormous guns at a small Greek island, in order to make the evacuation by sea of 2000 fellow Allied soldiers at a nearby island succeed. Of course lots of things go wrong and lots of action occurs. They get into some serious situations but often also manage to get out of it, thanks to some often unlikely but always entertaining occurrence. Yes, the story is certainly one of the biggest reasons why this movie is a very great and especially memorable one. The story is based on the novel by Alistair MacLean, who of course knew how to write an entertaining, adventurous WW II story.But probably the main reason why this movie is regarded as being an absolute classic, is due to the cast. There are some impressive and much respected names out of the business present in this movie. Gregory Peck was one of the best actors who ever lived and further more the movie has Anthony Quinn and David Niven in the most significant roles. Every actor in the movie plays an interesting character. The story is mainly set around the small group of 6 Allied soldiers whose mission it is to destroy the guns of Navarone. Every character is deliciously stereotypical and has his very own specialty. The characters suit in perfectly with the adventurous and entertaining story. The actors that portray them make their characters even more enjoyable and great to watch. Gregory Peck is a great leading man and he has some great chemistry with especially Anthony Quinn. David Niven plays the sort of comic relief and his character has got some of the best lines of the movie.It's sort of too bad that the movie had two prominent female characters in it. Nothing wrong with female emancipation in war movies but the characters need to serve a significant purpose. The movie could had easily done without the female characters and to be honest it makes the movie perhaps drag a little on at points, due to some needless slow sequences. Basically this movie is one of those typical ultimate man movies, in which female characters should have no part in. It just didn't feel fitting. No offense ladies, I still love you!The movie is long but the pace is high, thanks to the nimble editing and lots of action filled sequences that are present in the movie. It makes The Guns of Navarone a delightful 158 minutes that provides almost non-stop entertainment and action.The movie has some great looking settings and the action sequences are well directed and brought to the screen. It gives the movie a sort of an epic feeling overall.

The movie could had easily done without the female characters and to be honest it makes the movie perhaps drag a little on at points, due to some needless slow sequences.

No offense ladies, I still love you!The movie is long but the pace is high, thanks to the nimble editing and lots of action filled sequences that are present in the movie. It makes The Guns of Navarone a delightful 158 minutes that provides almost non-stop entertainment and action.The movie has some great looking settings and the action sequences are well directed and brought to the screen.

Movies such as Where Eagles Dare, Kelly's Heroes and The Eagle Has Landed. They were always carefully made with lots of eye for entertainment and had a star-filled cast, with wonderful actors. This movie is right up there with the very best and most entertaining adventurous WW II movies. The sentence; 'they don't make them like this anymore', certainly applies here.The movie has a wonderful adventurous and heroic story about a small group of Allied soldiers who are send on a mission to destroy two enormous guns at a small Greek island, in order to make the evacuation by sea of 2000 fellow Allied soldiers at a nearby island succeed. Of course lots of things go wrong and lots of action occurs. They get into some serious situations but often also manage to get out of it, thanks to some often unlikely but always entertaining occurrence. Yes, the story is certainly one of the biggest reasons why this movie is a very great and especially memorable one. The story is based on the novel by Alistair MacLean, who of course knew how to write an entertaining, adventurous WW II story.But probably the main reason why this movie is regarded as being an absolute classic, is due to the cast. There are some impressive and much respected names out of the business present in this movie. Gregory Peck was one of the best actors who ever lived and further more the movie has Anthony Quinn and David Niven in the most significant roles. Every actor in the movie plays an interesting character. The story is mainly set around the small group of 6 Allied soldiers whose mission it is to destroy the guns of Navarone. Every character is deliciously stereotypical and has his very own specialty. The characters suit in perfectly with the adventurous and entertaining story. The actors that portray them make their characters even more enjoyable and great to watch. Gregory Peck is a great leading man and he has some great chemistry with especially Anthony Quinn. David Niven plays the sort of comic relief and his character has got some of the best lines of the movie.It's sort of too bad that the movie had two prominent female characters in it.

Witty, intelligent, vulgar, happy, sad, The Big Lebowski runs through the gambit of emotions like few other films can match. Wrought with eccentric characters throughout the film, The Big Lebowski creates some of the most memorable characters on the Tinsel Town scene. Jeffery Lebowski (Jeff Bridges), who goes by the moniker 'The Dude', an unemployed burnout who enjoys driving around, bowling, and the occasional acid flash back. Walter Sobchak (John Goodman), a Vietnam veteran, converted Jew, who's still living in the past of both the Vietnam War and his former marriage with his ex-wife Cynthia. Theodore Donald Kerabatsos (Steve Buscemi), known as Donny, a California surfer who enjoys bowling, always seems a little lost, or at best a page behind the rest of the group. Jeffery Lebowski (David Huddleston), the real Jeffery Lebowski, the Big Lebowski, a paraplegic Korean War veteran supposed self made millionaire and head of the Little Lebowski Urban Achievers Foundation, who has a penchant for vanity, as evidenced by his choice of second wife, Bunny Lebowski (Tara Reid), a young, beautiful, porn star nymphomaniac. This is just a glimpse at a few of the movie's characters who inadvertently interact together and solidify one of the movie's greatest achievements the dialogue. The array of characters that the Cohen Brothers create, along with the brilliant casting of each character, allows them to script some of the wittiest dialogue of any movie ever written. Ranging from absurd and vulgar to intelligent and insightful, the dialogue flows so naturally and meshes so intricately throughout the movie that multiple viewings are necessary to completely appreciate the skilled craftsmanship of the syntactical and grammatical structure employed by the characters. The Dude enjoys life's simple pleasures and leads a normal dysfunctional unproductive life of drinking, causal drug use, driving around, and most importantly, league bowling. His apartment has a rug, a rug that really ties the room together. That is until his rug is mitterated upon by two of Jackie Treehorn's thugs in an attempt to recover a sum of money from The Big Lebowski. After a brilliantly crafted brainstorming dialogue session at the bowling alley with his eccentric bowling team, Walter Sobchak and Donny, the Dude decides to rectify his rug situation by going to the real Jeffery Lebowski, whose rug the thugs were really trying to mitterate upon, and recover another rug, hopefully one that can match the old rug's ability to really tie the room together. Meeting with contempt and hostility from the Big Lebowski, the Dude eventually finagles a rug from the real Jeffery Lebowski's house. This episode marks the beginning of a precarious relationship between the two Lebowskis. The Big Lebowski calls upon the Dude after the Big Lebowski receives a ransom note stating that the love of his life, Bunny Lebowski, has been kidnapped. From here, the movie takes twists and turns as the Dude acts as courier of the ransom money and finds himself center stage in the whole kidnapping fiasco, mainly because he is in a unique position to either confirm or deny the carpet pissers as the identity of the kidnappers. As the movie culminates, the two Lebowskis have a final bout, exposing the true nature of each. Without wasting millions of dollars on special effects to fill in for thin plot lines and fluff for weak scenes and content, the Cohen Brothers displayed their prowess through manipulating language and intelligently designing one of the best movies ever produced. Every time I watch this movie, I find something that I previously missed. The Big Lebowski firmly cements the Cohen Brothers as Hollywood stalwarts in the movie industry.

There's a good reason why this film doesn't have its praises sang very often too; as it's not very good. All I wanted from this film was an entertaining action feature; and after the first sequence, which takes place in a taxi cab, I really thought I was going to get what I wanted. The first sequence is clever and thrilling; but the film just can't keep that up, as after the initial sequence it descends into tedium and despite a few worthwhile moments, it never really gets out of it. The plot follows Robert Rath; a professional hit-man who wants out. His efforts to get out, however, are thwarted by the appearance of Miguel Bain; a younger assassin who has taken it upon himself to get rid of Rath himself. We then follow the hit-man as he teams up with a woman named Electra and tries to kill the younger man before he gets it himself.The Wachowski's clearly have a flair for scripting exciting action scenes, as their later opus showed; but aside from a couple of sequences, this film doesn't feature a great deal in the way of excitement. The Wachowski's also showed with The Matrix that they can handle a complex plot...so why can't they do a very good job with the simple one in this film? Much of the plot is very routine and predictable, while the ending comes out of nowhere with a plot twist that harks back to an idea that was never really a big thing earlier on in the film. The cast is fairly strong, with action icon Sylvester Stallone going through the motions in the lead role. He is joined by a charismatic Antonio Banderas, who's not bad as his opposite number; while the talented Julianne Moore is given a role way below her later standards. There are a number of good ideas in this film, but many of them would do better if the rest of the film was good also. The good cast never really gets a chance to shine, and overall, all I can rate this film as is a shame as considering all the elements and the people involved; it could have been decent example of the genre.

Despite deconstructing the hero and making him a bit of a dangerous loony, the film exudes quality throughout. The sets are incredible with their detail and darkness, the acting is top-notch and the script is generally great, except when they diverge into irrelevant flashback scenes that do NOTHING to improve the story.Bruce Wayne is a complicated guy. Yes, he's rich and fights crime, but he's on the edge. Vicki Vale is a hot reporter who is apparently not mentally ill but also has no real purpose in the movie but to get saved by Batman. The Joker is a total nut-case--but a fun to watch nut-case, as he struts and preens while he dispenses evil.He is by far the best character in the film, as Jack Nicholson seems to have a lot of fun. Some of the most awfully violent but amusing images were the Joker's joy buzzer as well as the effects of Joker Brand cosmetics on its victims (two dead ladies make postmortem appearances in one of the Joker's ads on TV endorsing the products!). In addition, I loved the scene where the Joker and his men trash an art museum--spray painting and smashing artwork with abandon. That is until they get to the painting The Scream--Joker tells his men to leave that one alone--Now that I like.Aside from the dumb back story, I liked all of the movie--even the violent things Joker did that I listed above. HOWEVER, I was appalled that the movie was marketed so strongly to kids, as this was NOT a kids' film. My wife and I saw a guy in the theater with his two year-old! The kid, naturally, screamed through much of the movie!! For adults, it's a wonderful film--but for kids under 12 or so, no way--it's just too dark and violent.
