But there really are more legitimate reasons to find the film, directed by Mark Goldblatt and written by Boaz Yakin, flawed and not satisfying some twenty years after its release. It still carries that 80's action feel and not always in a good way. Some of the story its just silly, even if it is based off the comics, such as Frank Castle having as his place of residence after his wife and son are killed being the sewers. Unless you're a Ninja Turtle, does it make much sense to squat in the sewers? Perhaps if you're into being naked and meditating before going out and killing whatever comes one's way.There's a lot of violence in this Punisher, but only a handful of instances where the action really connects on a YES! level. There's a shootout at at a harbor between lots of bad-guys (Castle looking on with a sniper's view) and it's competently staged and with some brutal blood, but its not really exciting. There's a scene where Frank Castle, on the look-out for the last BIG mob to kill (this being the Yakuza or whatever), finds the children of the mobsters that have been kidnapped by the Yakuza-whatevers, and gets them on a bus. There's a near-great chase here, kind of like the switcharoo of the climax of Dirty Harry. There's some decent acting (decent but only on-par with other action vehicles of the period) between Lou Gossett Jr and Lundgren when he is finally captured (for the moment) and is scolded for his form of vengeance.And there's the climax, but that starts to unravel and go between the silly pre-Kill Bill style theatrics of action staged rampantly among dojo-looking sets, and some legitimate drama involving the son of the BIG baddie who did such horrors onto Castle's family. A lot of the plot is very basic so it's not even worth repeating here, but worse is anything resembling decent acting. Lundgren does alright with his character, but rarely do we see any life put into him. In a seemingly daring scene where Lundgren is tied up and threatened with some weapon that might cut off his arm or other, there's not much drama because of how lax the actor looks in the scene. When he's over-the-top, Lundgren can do wonders. As a simple hero going through the beats, it's just...

What's also amazing is that although I am a huge cinemaniac, I am willing to dare to say that the god of cinema snobs, Stanley Kubrick, made a film that was far from perfect. The bottom line is that although the plot was very interesting, the film was simply too low energy, too long and too over-stylized.I must stop to make a horrible confession. Despite having now done over 9000 reviews for IMDb, I have very, very mixed feelings about Kubrick's films and the following are my insane opinions about many of his more famous films. Some are masterpieces--such as Dr. Strangelove, Paths of Glory and The Killing. Others, exceptional but flawed--Spartacus went on too long and should have ended at the 'I am Spartacus' scene (then it would have been perfect). Others, way, way, way overrated--2001 is is definitely so. And others are so long and dull it boggles the mind--Barry Lyndon made we want to scream it moved so slowly.As for Eyes Wide Shut, it is far from Kubrick's best work and it is painfully slow...but it does merit watching. The basic story idea is, at times, intriguing. There is a lot to like. But, the film shows a certain painfully obsessive quality--a need to show EVERYTHING--every emotion, every grimace...almost every breath! Considering that Mr. Kubrick was well-known for his OCD-like qualities (often shooting scenes again and again and again as well as going months or years past deadlines), this isn't too surprising. Plus, by the time he made the film he was a bit of a film guru--and adored so much that no one would dare question why this movie clocks in at almost 168 minutes--whereas another director might complete the film in less than 120.There is also one thing that boggled my mind about the movie. Although the film should have received an NC-17 rating (again, I assume this was withheld because it was a Kubrick film), even with gobs of full-frontal nudity, it managed to make sex boring! The way some of the sex scenes were so over-choreographed (especially at the party at the mansion where Cruise was the interloper) made me wish that despite the gorgeous women that they'd just cut much of it. As a result, while it's not a film I'd rush to show a teenager, it's almost sanitary enough that you could.As far as the performances go, the best in the film was by Sidney Pollack.

I sure wanted to see more acting like this--and perhaps, in a way, Pollack was directing himself a bit.So far, it really sounds like I disliked the film, though this isn't exactly true--I mostly just disliked the way it was directed (ahhh....I must be a heretic). As for the extremely sexy story, some of it was great. I liked how the film explored what might happen if couples are too open about their sexual fantasies and the irreparable harm it can cause. I liked the idea of a secret society made up of the rich and powerful. I liked the way that you never knew exactly whether or not Cruise might die. But, I also think I've seen much of this done better in John Frankenheimer's Seconds. I know that Frankenheimer is a very, very well-respected director but know few would say he was better than Kubrick--but in this particular case I think he did a better job mostly because his film was more direct, less self-indulgent and lacked the occasionally annoying soundtrack.

Though now it's considered to be a modern classic. American Psycho the film turns out to be much less controversial. That's because just about all the coarse language, sex and torture scenes weren't included. Instead director Mary Harron smartly focused on the novel's black comedy and character study. Christian Bale is fantastic in the lead role. Just watch his confession on the phone at the end of the film for proof. The looks he gives, the way he talks and moves, and his appearance are very good. In my opinion he's not quite the ideal Patrick Bateman but he comes very close. The murder chapters in the novel gave it an edge, made it more memorable. The exclusion of most of these murders from the film made the cinematic endeavour tamed in comparison. Let's face it, what's shown in the film isn't anything new for cinema. There are films that are much more disturbing and bloody than American Psycho. In any case the murders would have been hard and costly to film if they were included. With the film's minor budget and the controversy surrounding the novel these scenes weren't attempted. What surprised me most, however, was that fitting actors were cast in the supporting roles. They looked and acted the way they were supposed to. Reese Witherspoon played the role of Evelyn Williams. Very nice. Harron's direction turns out to be good as well. Most novel to film adaptations are junk, but here the results are quite good. Thankfully, Bateman's 1980s music reviews (Genesis, Whitney Houston, Huey Lewis & The News) were incorporated into a few scenes. Not in their entirety obviously but some of the best parts are there. The film's comedy is very fine. The story's horror elements are what's best though. Bateman has many characteristics of 1980s society and modern society in general. That's what makes him so important; he just represents the extremes of what people think and how they act nowadays. Even if they don't like to admit it many people resemble Bateman in some way. The soundtrack is, for the most part, upbeat. Cinematographer Andrzej Sekula captured the New York scenery that was necessary. It's not an ideal-looking film set in the 1980s but it's not bad. American Psycho the film is not a bad companion piece to the novel. It's an intellectual horror film; one of the best horror films of the last decade in fact. I recommend it.

Thankfully, Bateman's 1980s music reviews (Genesis, Whitney Houston, Huey Lewis & The News) were incorporated into a few scenes. Not in their entirety obviously but some of the best parts are there. The film's comedy is very fine. The story's horror elements are what's best though. Bateman has many characteristics of 1980s society and modern society in general. That's what makes him so important; he just represents the extremes of what people think and how they act nowadays. Even if they don't like to admit it many people resemble Bateman in some way. The soundtrack is, for the most part, upbeat. Cinematographer Andrzej Sekula captured the New York scenery that was necessary. It's not an ideal-looking film set in the 1980s but it's not bad. American Psycho the film is not a bad companion piece to the novel. It's an intellectual horror film; one of the best horror films of the last decade in fact. I recommend it. ","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"10 August 2010","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" American Psycho the novel remains a controversial piece of literature. Though now it's considered to be a modern classic. American Psycho the film turns out to be much less controversial. That's because just about all the coarse language, sex and torture scenes weren't included. Instead director Mary Harron smartly focused on the novel's black comedy and character study. Christian Bale is fantastic in the lead role. Just watch his confession on the phone at the end of the film for proof. The looks he gives, the way he talks and moves, and his appearance are very good. In my opinion he's not quite the ideal Patrick Bateman but he comes very close. The murder chapters in the novel gave it an edge, made it more memorable. The exclusion of most of these murders from the film made the cinematic endeavour tamed in comparison. Let's face it, what's shown in the film isn't anything new for cinema. There are films that are much more disturbing and bloody than American Psycho. In any case the murders would have been hard and costly to film if they were included. With the film's minor budget and the controversy surrounding the novel these scenes weren't attempted.

Everyone has their notion of what rock bottom means, but the general consensus is when your life just can't go any lower. This idea is subjective to the individual so take your own definition of rock bottom then multiply it by 10. Now you have the depravity and tragedy of Jim Carroll, the person who The Basketball Diaries is based on. This movie tells the story of Jim Carroll in his teenage years as he deals with rapidly growing drug addiction. It begins with him and his basketball team, one of the most important things in his life. He has some wild friends whose judgment might not be the best, another friend who is dying of leukemia, and a teacher who isn't very fond of him. Regardless, his future still looks promising. But as the story progresses, Jim and his friends sink deeper and deeper into addiction. His life falls to pieces around him as everyone he thought cared about him turn on him one by one. It makes for a depressing and brutal look at real life.The story here is a difficult one that only gets sadder as it progresses. Everything only gets worse and worse, with no uplifting catharsis anywhere along the line. The tone of the film can be represented by a line that slopes downward the entire length. Jim's life stoops to such depressing lows and his drug addiction puts him in situations I could never imagine being in. It is a different kind of life with so few boundaries and rules that he and his friends basically run rampant throughout the streets of New York. I wasn't entirely sure of the directors intentions with this film. I couldn't tell whether I was supposed to sympathize with Jim and his friends or not. The bleak look at this reality makes one feel sympathy and sorrow for these unfortunate characters, yet at the same time everything that happens to them was brought about by their own actions. It is here that I question just how much sympathy I can feel for a group of teenagers with such poor judgment. I can't help but think that they had it coming. But like I said, they live in a different world where their actions are not judged as harshly by the people around them and they must learn for themselves the difference between right and wrong, all through personal experience. It is human nature to make mistakes, and Jim Carroll and his friends make their fair share in The Basketball Diaries. It is a debate that will rage for centuries, but for now I'll have to move on.Looking past the emotional intentions of the film, it is technically well made and merits praise in many areas. The film is gritty and realistic, and the actors do a fine job at portraying these elements. My opinion of Leonardo DiCaprio has changed over the years. When he entered the Hollywood scene he was quickly type-casted as the romantic prettyboy, fulfilling this stereotype in films such as Titanic (1997) and Romeo + Juliet (1996). As he has grown older and matured, I have gained much more respect for him. His recent roles like Martin Scorsese's pictures The Departed (2006) and Shutter Island (2010) both amazed me. His most recent role in Inception (2010) was also exceptional. The Basketball Diaries was released in 1996, during his prettyboy phase. Yet this one stands out and he plays a much different character. In this film we see DiCaprio in a much different light than Titanic or Romeo + Juliet when we watch snot run down his face with tears in his eyes as he begs and begs for drugs. He fits the role very well, and it is almost because of his prettyboy reputation that it is so tragic to see him stoop so low. The supporting cast does a great job here as well, such as the flamboyantly angry Mark Wahlberg (Three Kings, Boogie Nights) filling his ever aggravated typecast role. The direction stands out in some scenes more than others but it is very good nonetheless. There are some odd dream sequences that break the flow of the film, yet I never found myself losing touch with it or getting overly distracted. There's nothing that truly holds The Basketball Diaries back from being a fine film.This movie provides a harsh look into reality, so be prepared to have one mans depression beat into you with one harrowing scene after another. The Basketball Diaries is not delivered without issues, but it is a well made and well acted film with its fair share of gritty insight into reality.

He is the brains behind films like Platoon, Born On The Fourth Of July, Natural Born Killers, Nixon, Wall Street, and JFK. He seldom fails, and apart from making the dismal Alexander a few years back, Stone is still one of America's most daring and influential filmmakers.JFK is the best picture Stone has ever made. There's little reason to believe he will ever surpass what he has accomplished for JFK. The film runs for more than three hours, and with the overwhelming amount of content and the humongous scope of the plot, it's unbelievable that Stone managed to complete the production of the film within two years. He expertly explains and explores the conspiracies that surround the assassination of President Kennedy back in the 1960s through spellbinding color and black-and-white images, and the recreation of the chain of sequences that lead to the assassination and its convoluted aftermath.Was he murdered by the lone shooter Lee Harvey Oswald? Or were there others involved? Did the US military, FBI, CIA conspire to kill their own President? What about the 'magic bullet' theory? Where's the Zapruder film kept? Was there a massive cover-up by the highest authorities of the American government, including its judiciary system? These are all aptly discussed in the film, providing crucial insights, and occasionally leaving more questions unanswered, challenging viewers to think and respond.Effective individual performances from A-listers like Kevin Costner, Tommy Lee Jones, Joe Pesci, Gary Oldman, Kevin Bacon, and Donald Sutherland combine flawlessly, resulting in one of the most extensive and well-assembled cast in the history of cinema. JFK won only two Oscars for best cinematography and film editing in a year dominated by Jonathan Demme's Silence Of The Lambs, a meager return for one of the best films of the century. The Academy owes Oliver Stone another best picture and director award.After critiquing hundreds of films over the last couple of years, JFK still remains rooted in the second spot of my Personal Top 100, only bettered by Steven Spielberg's Schindler's List. It is, in my opinion, the best edited film of all-time. The manner in which Oliver Stone filmed JFK through the use of disturbing flashback images, rapid-fire editing, and intertwining it with suspenseful pulsating rhythms by composer John Williams, and knowing it's all based on a terribly true event makes it one of the most chilling movie experiences ever. For students of film, JFK is a valuable source. For the rest of us, JFK is one of the greatest films we will ever see.SCORE 10\/10 (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved!

Or were there others involved? Did the US military, FBI, CIA conspire to kill their own President? What about the 'magic bullet' theory? Where's the Zapruder film kept?

These are all aptly discussed in the film, providing crucial insights, and occasionally leaving more questions unanswered, challenging viewers to think and respond.Effective individual performances from A-listers like Kevin Costner, Tommy Lee Jones, Joe Pesci, Gary Oldman, Kevin Bacon, and Donald Sutherland combine flawlessly, resulting in one of the most extensive and well-assembled cast in the history of cinema. JFK won only two Oscars for best cinematography and film editing in a year dominated by Jonathan Demme's Silence Of The Lambs, a meager return for one of the best films of the century. The Academy owes Oliver Stone another best picture and director award.After critiquing hundreds of films over the last couple of years, JFK still remains rooted in the second spot of my Personal Top 100, only bettered by Steven Spielberg's Schindler's List. It is, in my opinion, the best edited film of all-time. The manner in which Oliver Stone filmed JFK through the use of disturbing flashback images, rapid-fire editing, and intertwining it with suspenseful pulsating rhythms by composer John Williams, and knowing it's all based on a terribly true event makes it one of the most chilling movie experiences ever.

When a reporter sitting near him asks him the moral question along the lines of What would be the human responsibility when machines love us?, I thought absolutely nothing. End of movie.As the scene drew to a close, I knew this was not over. We had only seen 10 minutes of the film, and that sickening motorization of the female prototype as it put on makeup gave an eerie feeling. I had not realized that there was more to AI than just motor functions. Neither did the media covering Cybertronics. And that is what I figured would be attempted here.It turns out this is not a sci-fi horror. This is not I Robot or I Am Legend. The simple fact is that humans are not the I, but They. AI are the creations, which the movie shows us essentially evolve as the the story progresses. At first you have this box TV with legs saying 90 years ago he was the hit fashion on Sharper Image magazine or the likes. When it came to David, I had to question his authenticity.David is supposed to be a first-rate android. That means he is at the height of the evolutionary chain at the start of Professor Hobby's expansion into the unknown science of love robots. Before he receives his board chip, which puts a sort of finalization on his love schematics, he is completely a utilitarian robot designed for basic interaction. With the chip implanted, he becomes more lifelike and the mother likes him.Of course, as this is a fatalist film, something goes wrong. He shows incompetence to act as a normal human child and functions more as an alien life-form, putting the family he is assigned to in awkward positions and has the innate ability to harm. Inevitably, like Frankenstein, he is a freak. But not of nature, by manifestation of artificiality, which I believe to be one of the two main plots.Somewhere towards the end of the first act, his parents agree that he needs to thrown away. That is where this movie completely fails in its first plot, which is to somehow say that AI has an emotional connection with humans. For starters, they don't present the motive for Professor Hobby creating loving machines besides curiosity. The parents that buy the first love child don't even explain why they want him besides longing for their son's return. So they buy this fake child to replace their sick son? There are some extreme morality issues that are flat-out ignored by humans in this film.I would have given it a 4 out of 10 if that was all to be seen here. Instead, it gets better. Soon after, David is thrown out with Teddy the android bear(who I actually had a personal connection with), into an android landfill. To make things worse, this place turns androids into Public Enemy #1. There are actual android hunters like the one played by the scummy character of Brendan Gleeson. Now the story just took a sharp right turn into Nature vs Artificiality, which can explain about 2\/3 of the film.Man is trying to destroy artificiality before it consumes nature. It started with Greenhouse Gases. We saw what it did to New York City. It seems at this point in time there are alternate sources of energy for cars at least, as we seen people driving vehicles without exhaust pipes. We are continuously fooled into thinking there is going to be some co- harmony between AI and humans. But when Gigolo Joe says that humans are jealous of AI because they will outlive humans, we know where this film is going.Not too far ahead, we are reminded of this fantasy that is hope is nothing but a fairy tale in the form of the blue fairy. It leads us back to Professor Hobby, who we find out created robots out of his own selfishness. He couldn't live with the fact that his boy was dead forever. So he created a hundred Davids. The mastermind of greed attempts and does not falter in trying to convince us that he created something wonderful. In truth, he has created unvalued commodities, numbers on an assembly line.Lo and behold it DOES go down to the deep pits of the underworld, after a ridiculous encounter with a mannequin blue fairy at the bottom of the ocean where Manhattan used to be. Here is the prime example where the first plot fails at epic proportions. Due to his limitation in programming, there is no distinction as to whether there is a loop in his memory board, or he is THAT desperate for love that he asks the blue fairy to make him a real boy for 2000 years in the depths of the ocean.Eventually the movie ends with one of the worst movie endings of all time, or quite a good ending if you think about it symbolically, which leaves out the human condition. It involves a world where artificiality has won over nature, in which it looks like almost everything is mechanical or cybernetic, whatever is not considered natural. There is no organic life left on Earth, humans are extinct also. Essentially they do a reverse effect, having the AI be the Creators of artificial humans to bring back David's mommy.All-in-all a great fatalist piece, a terrible exploration into the why of creating AI humanoids, and a failure in making artificial life seem official.

With this film, we get a meta-presentation of the craft (Mulholland Drive comes to mind here).In the fiction portion, we have a student writing about a personal experience in a college writing class. The experience is explicitly shocking in its racial and sexual questioning, but even the 'shockingness' of it is questioned by Solondz. Unsurprisingly, Solondz beats us to the punch, already mapping our responses. The writing class responds to the story much like many of the reviewers here, using language like self-indulgent and shock with no substance. Solondz then brings up the question, how can this be if it really happened? What Solondz is depicting the grimy underbelly of suburbia, true in character, only appearing absurd and contrived when high in density. But once again, Solondz jabs us with the theory that once you begin writing it all becomes fiction.

In the film, we're introduced to the world of Andy's room when no one's around and the toys come to life. Woody (voiced by Tom Hanks) is a classic cowboy doll complete with a pull-string vocal box and reigns as young Andy's favorite toy. For his birthday, Andy receives a flashy new Buzz Lightyear action figure (voiced by Tim Allen) and Woody must cope with the fact that he may have been bumped from the top position. A botched attempt at lodging Buzz behind Andy's desk throws Buzz out into the real world and Woody must bring him back to regain the trust of the other toys.The fun of this kid's film lies in the characters. Allen is hilarious as Buzz and his inability to grasp that he's merely a child's toy and not an actual space ranger, spending half the film trying to return to Star Command; Hanks is a bit neurotic and totally high strung as Woody in his role as the toy-in-charge (going so far as to hold meetings on plastic erosion and establishing a buddy-system for moving day). The room is loaded with great supporting characters in the form of classic playthings from everyone's childhoods a Slinky dog, a Mr. Potato Head, a piggy bank&#x85;each with their own unique personalities. These characters are each fun enough to deserve their own movie and we're lucky to have been given the TOY STORY sequels to return to this world.I really enjoy the film overall (as do just about everyone I know who's seen it) and there is little to complain about. It's amazing to see how well the animation stands up after so many years. You can see that the computer graphics aren't as smooth as modern CG, but it's still near seamless.

Certainly darker and more violent than Superman IV when Zod was involved, but Terence Stamp made a truly dominant and intimidating villain--which is more than I can say for Lex Luthor in this version.On the other hand, the Lois and Clark scenes were campy and fun and I once again found myself wishing these two could be in a TV series. I liked Margot Kidder almost as much as Erica Durance. Almost. And Christopher Reeve was brilliant. Obviously that smile always seen after his accident was there before. The nerdy, clumsy Clark was almost as fun as in the fourth movie. On the other hand, Superman was a fine upstanding citizen who had a few more flaws here--though he still wasn't Tom Welling's more confused version of the character.

The acting in this show is what the modern movie crowd would call camp But, I just like to call it acting By that I mean the fun kind. No politically correct cultural pandering, and none of this twisted, misunderstood anti-hero nonsense. It's all wonderfully stereotypical chop socky goodness. Victor Wong and James Hong are both, IMHO, action movie legends and make this film a winner between just the two of them. Their respective characters, although mostly static, are instantly endearing and hilarious to watch. They pull it off with comedic talent alone. Kurt Russel, Dennis Dun and Kim Cattrall work well together and all give entertaining, memorable performances within their respective archetypes (Reluctant hero, sidekick, damsel in distress) The story itself? Well, just watch the movie. You'll pick it all up as it goes. It starts quickly and gets to the good parts without wasting your time with meaningless dialogue, side plots or back story. No hidden agendas, no bait-and-switch, no underlying social metaphors. It's just a story. A story where everybody gets beat up....a lot The special effects were....just that...effects. Nothing more. Crude by today's standards (obviously) but unlike 99.98% of contemporary action flicks, they weren't expected to support the entire show! They were special effects As in...not the entire budget! Wow! Even if you don't get a kick out of it, you can keep watching because there's an actual movie happening amidst it all! What a concept, huh?! The fights are all live action, with live extras who come in screaming, shooting and flailing like they really mean it. The hits come often and they don't stop until the the show ends.You will also notice a surprising lack of gore, profanity and overt sexuality\/nudity. A few cuts and scrapes, a couple rubber corpses here and there. A few cheap scares. Kurt Russell says shit a couple times. But, that's it. By today's standards, this show is almost family friendly and has the added bonus of not totally sucking.This movie is a rare gem compared to the endless list of ill conceived, overwrought, CG driven garbage that clutters up our screens.

A few cuts and scrapes, a couple rubber corpses here and there. A few cheap scares. Kurt Russell says shit a couple times. But, that's it.

I loved it when I was 6 years old and I love it now.Prepare to to be transported back in time to when not every film took itself so damned seriously. There's good guys, bad guys, minimal plot, cheesy dialogue and tons of good ol' kick, punch, gouge, slash and stab action! The acting in this show is what the modern movie crowd would call camp But, I just like to call it acting By that I mean the fun kind. No politically correct cultural pandering, and none of this twisted, misunderstood anti-hero nonsense. It's all wonderfully stereotypical chop socky goodness. Victor Wong and James Hong are both, IMHO, action movie legends and make this film a winner between just the two of them. Their respective characters, although mostly static, are instantly endearing and hilarious to watch. They pull it off with comedic talent alone.

Now that I've seen The Graduate in its entirety, I now see where that famous episode got its inspiration. Of course being that I'm only 24, that is perhaps the reason why I never quite caught on to the connection between this movie and that particular Simpsons episode, and plus I have an entire century of movies to pick up the references from!On the serious side, though, The Graduate is one of the best movies I've ever seen, and certainly one of the best movies ever made. Directed by Mike Nichols (who won an Oscar for Best Director) and adapted from the novel of the same name by Charles Webb, 21-year-old Benjamin Braddock (a then-30-year-old Dustin Hoffman in real life, in his film debut) is constantly on the verge of panic within the film's first 20 minutes. He's just graduated from college (hence the film's title), and has no clue about what he wants to do with his life. His upper-crust parents mistakenly think that he'll probably go to graduate school, after some much-needed rest & relaxation, of course. Instead, Ben just spends his days floating about aimlessly decked out in full scuba gear at the bottom of his parents' swimming pool.Ben does get some direction - or is it misdirection? - when Mrs. Robinson (the late Anne Bancroft), the wife of his father's business partner, tries to seduce him, and he eventually lets her, in private liaisons at an upscale downtown hotel. Ben's own youthful, post-college confusion and Mrs. Robinson's marital unhappiness is a match made in the hellish depths of suburban affluence. The affair continues on for a while with little problems, that is, until, Elaine Robinson (Katharine Ross), the Robinson's college-bound daughter, comes home from Berkeley and Ben suddenly finds some direction in his life because for the first in his life since he came home from college, he now knows what he wants because suddenly he's in love! This of course, causes all sorts of problems because he can't date Elaine while still carrying on a sordid affair with her mother!I've found yet another screen hero in Dustin Hoffman's portrayal of Benjamin Braddock. He's the character that defined a generation; not just for college kids circa-1967, but for college kids 43 years later in 2010! Any kid who goes to college for four years (in my case 5 1\/2) and comes out without a single clue as to their future, will instantly find something to like about Ben. (I know sometimes that I feel that I'm Ben; I'm out of college three months and working full-time and still questioning whether or not I made the right decision in my college career.) Ben is confused, desperate, alienated, and clueless. The world as he knows it is big, bad, and scary (hence why he finds solace at the bottom of his parents' swimming pool). His parents expect that he's going to go and make something big of himself, but one of the film's themes regards the cross-generational shift in values, and so some (if not all) of the norms & values of his parents' age may not fit in within the norms & values of his generation.And of course, Ben's generation's norms & values are perhaps quite radically different from mine. In my age- and sex-obsessed generation of 2010, you can bet that Ben's generation of baby boomers would have coronaries due to 2010 standards of right and wrong, what's cool and uncool. And it just seems to me, at least, that people in my generation only just seem to really want instant gratification without really having the will to work for it (which could be blamed on the older generations, each previous one working hard so that the next one has it a little bit easier - but my generation seems to me, to get bored pretty easily, lacks any real moral\/ethical foundations, and overall just seems to be pretty lazy); but again, this could be blamed on previous generations.At the end of the day, The Graduate is really all just about Ben, and his lack of direction. Only when he makes the mistake of falling for Elaine Robinson does his future become clear it's to marry her, with little pondering of what goes on after that, as demonstrated by this film's hilarious albeit appropriately awkward ending at a church. Anne Bancroft creates a sexy and fearsome, but ultimately tragic and sympathetic Mrs. Robinson. She's not a monster who really forces herself upon Our Poor Hero (a cougar as today's modern slang terminology would call her), but she's someone who has a chance to make herself happy for once while stuck in a loveless marriage and it seems that she will do anything to keep Ben all to herself, much to his kicking & screaming (heart's dismay). We were all saddened by her passing in 2005, but if she is remembered for any of her many iconic screen roles, it should be the beautiful and seductive, not-so-ordinary suburban housewife Mrs. Robinson.The Graduate is obviously dated by its '60s-era Simon & Garfunkel-performed soundtrack. And even if the dated soundtrack is a musical vocalization of Ben's (and to a greater extent, '60s-era college graduates) frustrations and anxieties, the movie itself still has great relevance today, and for that reason alone, The Graduate will never grow old, and will always receive top honors from movie-lovers everywhere, no matter what decade.10\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"10 August 2010","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Incredibly enough, the only reason I even had the slightest clue about this movie was due to an episode of The Simpsons a few years back.
