The one thing in her life that isn't perfect is that she can't match everyone up.

The second Star Trek movie is swift,droll,and adventurous,not to mention appealingly gadget-happy and outstanding special effects. It was everything the first one should have been,and wasn't. As the title suggests,Star Trek IIThe Wrath of Khan,has a much stronger plot than its predecessor with really helps and its an overall improvement. The film also has the gamesmanship that the first installment lacked,a quality that helped win the Star Trek television series its amazingly devoted following. Maybe its just that there are more special features aboard the Starship Enterprise this time,or that the costumes are so clever,or that the special effects are so eyepopping beyond belief that they don't call undue attention to themselves. Perhaps,its the directorial switch from Robert Wise(of The Andromeda Strain,The Hindenburg,and The Sound of Music)to Nicholas Meyer(Time after Time)that has brought the material more into view and into more pep with the original television series. In any case,this was in fact was the best and the most better installment of the series and perhaps way more better in plot and action than in all of the ten theatrical features that Star Trek has been based on. And Star Trek IIThe Wrath of Khan is the stylish out of them all.In addition to the unexpected twists and turn and not to mention feats of derring-do the film also has the quality of a sentimental journey. This time around by bringing back the original cast of the television series;William Shatner(Admiral Kirk),Leonard Nimoy(Mister Spock),DeForest Kelley(Dr. McCoy),Nichelle Nichols(Lt. Uhara),George Takei(Capt. Sulu),James Doohan(Scotty),Walter Koenig(Chekov),and the rest of the crew for another breathtaking adventure into the unknown. This time around Mr. Shatner's Captain Kirk is an admiral now,given to ribbing the young trainees and wistfully saying awkward things,as usual. Mr. Spock now has a pointy-eared protegee named Saavik(Kristie Alley) with whom he converses in their native tongue. This sequel may not make a new Trek devotee out of anyone,but will surely delight the older ones that have grown up with the original television series. Even the mambo-jumbo of this is not only fun,but absolutely hilarious especially with Shatner doing what he does best--over the top acting.But what makes this movie more intriguing and fun not to mention exciting to watch is Kirk's old nemesis-Khan as played by the classiest of comic strip villains by Ricardo Montalban(who was also played the same character in the television version Space Seed from the Star Trek series)who makes this movie jumped to life. With his fierce profile,long white hair,manful decolletage,and space age jewelry,Mr. Montalban looks like the world's oldest rock star or space Indian chief,but what makes his character some diabolically evil is something that really brings the film to life and its worth seeing why. Even so after 25 years of its release,the film still holds status as one of the greatest Trek sequels not to mention the greatest science-fiction films of the 1980's. Released in the summer of 1982,Star Trek IIThe Wrath of Khan came out right around the time Steven Spielburg's sci-fi fantasy ET,and Tobe Hooper's Poltergeist dominated the summer box office. Getting back to Star Trek II,it may lasts of long time(at a running length of 114 minutes),its worth seeing especially for the great space battle sequences and Kirk finally getting even with his long time evil nemesis. It may have been corny,but what can you expect for those who never have seen the original TV show or for matter veterans fans of the series.

I knew that it was an alien movie, and I knew that some people liked it, but I really didn't know anything else. To me, it was just that Spielberg alien movie he did before E.T. So coming into this with no expectations, I was very surprised to see such a well-crafted masterpiece play out before my eyes. That's right, a masterpiece. I have no bad things to say about this movie. Nit-picking, I'd say the movie runs a little long. But in all fairness, it doesn't really matter because it never feels like it. Sometimes there are scenes that could have been cut because they repeat the point over and over, but again, doesn't hurt the story really. This movie would not be nearly as fantastic without Richard Dreyfuss. He carries this entire thing on his back as a simple man who has an encounter with something extraordinary. I love the way Spielberg had shown what it was doing not only to him, but people who knew him. All he wanted was answers and there was no way he could get it as no one believes or supports his story. The rest of the cast did their jobs just as well. Some of the smaller roles I really enjoyed. Cary Guffey helped us see these events from a child's perspective, and he wasn't annoying or anything. Child actors that aren't annoying are hard to come by. Plus we get a cameo from Lance The Man Henriksen! This movie also excels in the story, which is paced greatly and spends time developing the characters and letting us get to know them, before a big finale that reveals the aliens after basically flashes of color. The score by John Williams is also superb. The special effects, as I've mentioned in the beginning still hold up today and are fantastic. The space ships are kept simple, yet still look good. Little tiny problems are present here and there, as I've mentioned. However, none of it really detracts from this movie. Steven Spielberg finally matures to the level we know him for with this movie after heading in the right direction with Jaws. I can't recommend this any more.Rating ****1\/2 of ***** ","genre":null},{"date":"17 July 2007","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" StarringRichard Dreyfuss as Roy Neary Francois Truffaut as Lacombe Melinda Dillon as Jillian GuilerPlot Strange events are occurring around the globe, such as planes and navy vessels thought lost in the 1940's sudden reappearing in deserts.

I thought it would be a horror film about a family who moves into a glass house and then a killer watches them through a window and goes on a killing spree for no reason. That idea is very stereotypical. But I rented it anyways because I thought it would be like any other horror film cheesy, stupid, and fun! But my plot guess was completely off. The real plot is totally different. The plot focuses on 16 year old Ruby Baker(Leelee Sobieski), whose parents, Dave and Grace, just recently died in a car accident. So her and her game obsessed brother, Rhett move in with their neighbors, Erin(Diane Lane) and Terry Glass(Stellan Skarsgård). They are all happy and everything is fine. But as things change, Ruby gets suspicious that Erin and Terry aren't all sweet and kind. She talks to a guidance counselor, Alvin Begleiter(Bruce Dem) and finds out that their parents left them 4 million dollars. Things get very strange in the house. Erin is seen injecting herself, Ruby thinks Terry was trying to rape her, and there are a lot of suspicious phone calls.ReviewActing 7\/10. The acting was all right throughout the film. Leelee Sobieski was a nice fit for the part of Ruby. Her acting was pretty good seeing this movie was more of a drama film than a thriller. Other cast members, Diane Lane and Stellan Skarsgård were pretty good but they weren't at their best. The one performance that stands out was Trevor Morgan's character. He played Rhett and he played him well. Overall the acting was decent.Story 6\/10. The story wasn't bad. But the whole car accident scenario has been used before. But I think it is an interesting twist on it and the story won't be what you think.Entertaining 7\/10. This movie wasn't the most entertaining thriller I have ever seen. It was more of a drama than a thriller because it let more dramatic than thrilling scenes in the film. Some of it could be boring while some of it was suspenseful.Humor 3\/10. Well, it wasn't funny. But that's okay. It wasn't supposed to be funny. It was meant to be about Ruby and Rhett's time with Glasses and all their problems. So humor wasn't really necessary.Pros of The Film -It was interesting. -It showed Ruby's troubles and grief after her parent's deaths very well. -Rhett was awesome. -The acting was above averageCons of the Film -A bit too long -Boring sometimesOverall I thought the film was enjoyable and a little corny, but fun none the less. And a message for guys, if you want your girlfriend to hug your arm in fright while watching a horror film, I don't recommend the Glass House because it is more of a drama then a horror. I would recommend the new horror flick, 1408. That one is scary. But watch this film for a little fun.

The same goes for William Goldman, a hard, cynical bastard if ever there was one. So why is this movie dripping in so much sentimental goo that it feels like an explosion at a candy floss factory? It doesn't help that there isn't much plot to go around. Boy meets weird old lodger, weird old lodger turns out to be wanted by... well, some bunch of nasties, anyway, for some reason. Several baddies get the old man, another of them rapes the boy's mother. And all this somehow helps the kid grow up - which makes everything all right, I guess.Let's say one thing straight out Scott Hicks is a great man when it comes to composing a shot. Some of the scenes here are pure artistry, and they look beautiful. And there are good moments, too, most notably the scene with Alan Tudyk's 3-card monte man, and the opening scenes with David Morse. Those scenes set me up for thinking that this film was going to be a near-classic, but as soon as Morse goes away, the whole thing doesn't so much slide downhill as crash off a cliff. It starts with a couple of scenes of kids playing in an idyllic parkland setting, then a scene with Hannibal Lecter, than a couple more scenes of the kids playing, then a couple more, until you're just about screaming at the director to get on with it, already.A lot of the problems centre around Anthony Hopkins. Oh, he has his moments - the football story was outstanding, and he fills the character well. But he can't seem to get the accent right, or even know which accent he's attempting for most of the movie. Worse still, just about half his dialogue consists of wise-old-man homilies that make him sound like a Welsh version of Yoda. The other performances are actually worse, and I don't take any joy in saying that the kids simply weren't up to the demands of their roles. Twenty years ago we had another King adaptation called Stand By Me, with four child actors who gave probably the best performances of that year. This year... well, these kids ain't in that class, and that's a shame.Then there are some startling plot holes. Hopkins, we are told, can foresee events by touching people. So how come he doesn't foresee that his landlady is going to get assaulted by her sleazy date, when I could predict that without any psychic powers? Or is it that he does foresee it, and just doesn't care? Why does Bobby's mother overreact to such an absurd extent when she finds Hopkins curing the little girl? Why doesn't the girl stick up for Hopkins? Why, for that matter, are we led to believe that she is on the verge of death when it turns out she's got nothing worse than a broken arm? Hopkins calls her a lion-heart, but the way she was screaming and hollering, I assumed she must have a fractured skull or maybe a tree-branch sticking out of her guts. And if it was her ARM that was broken, how come she couldn't walk away from the scene of her attack, but had to get Bobby to carry her? The scene was written to be a major crisis, so everyone had to play it as though it was, even though her injury was actually pretty minor - the result was that everyone ended up looking like ridiculous drama queens.That sounds picky, I know, but I'm not even asking for the movie to make sense. I just want characters that behave in realistic, human ways, instead of like cyphers written by someone who doesn't know how real people behave. William Goldman can do better than this. In fact, everyone involved can do better.Update I actually couldn't believe that Stephen King would write anything as gooey as this, so I went out and bought the book. And you know what? He didn't write anything as gooey as this. The book of Hearts in Atlantis is a strange, lyrical and tragic story (or set of stories - it's kinda complicated) - which carries a stark message about the way the opportunities of the Sixties were thrown away in a haze of drugs and consumer durables.

It may depart from the story in some respects, but the changes are effective for a film.The excellent Miguel Ferrer, who often pops up in King-based films, stars here as a tabloid reporter, Richard Dees. He seems to have lost his touch, or at least his boss thinks so, but he gets a chance to cover a juicy new story a pilot who lands at small, obscure airports and kills the people vampire-style. His victims seem to be entranced by him and, in the case of one woman, infatuated by him, and despite warnings posted throughout the country, no one has reported seeing his plane or turned him in. He calls himself Dwight Renfield, an homage to both the character Renfield and the actor, Dwight Frye, who played him in the Lugosi version of Dracula.But there's also a new reporter in town, Katherine Blair (Julie Entwistle). She is young, perky, enthusiastic . . . everything the jaded, emotionally numb Dees is not. It's a case of hate at first sight. Dees turns down this story at first, but when Renfield claims another victim, he decides to start following the case. There follows a period of Dees simultaneously stalking and being stalked by his prey, Renfield, as he interviews friends of victims and witnesses. In the course of this, he dubbs his subject The Night Flier.And, in case we should wonder just how low he's willing to sink for a good tabloid story, we see him vandalizing a victim's grave by decorating it with dead flowers and smearing his own blood on it. He receives warnings to stop his pursuit of the story, including, in one darkly humorous scene, a Bloody Mary that he did not order for himself. When he inquires, it turns out that the man who ordered the drink for him has disappeared. When he looks at the napkin under the glass, he sees a simple note Stop now. Our killer, you see, does not want to have to kill Dees, for reasons that become more clear later. Meanwhile, Dees's more-than-slightly-devious boss has encouraged Katherine to pursue the story herself, and laughs delightedly when he learns that the two are staying at the same motel and are therefore bound to bump into each other . . . and butt heads.They do, in fact, meet up, and Dees convinces Katherine that he wants to join forces. The two start working together and eventually come up with a hot lead Dees talks to a supervisor at an airport who is clearly lying when he claims not to have seen Renfield or his plane.The two plan to go to said airport together, but Dees pushes Katherine into a closet in his motel room and locks her in, intent on keeping the story for himself (Renfield has become something of an obsession for him). He arrives at the airport and finds himself surrounded by Renfield's freshly-killed victims. Any doubt that he had actually been tracking a real vampire goes out the window. He begins taking pictures, but soon is unable to remain his usual stoic self and becomes physically ill. Enter Renfield, who we cannot see at first, as we are looking into a mirror in Dees's POV, but who we hear in the form of footsteps and see in the form of smashing mirrors and stream of blood instead of urine going into a urinal.Here follows the ultimate, final confrontation between journalist and subject, in what is possibly one of the most intensely frightening scenes I've ever seen. After demanding that Dees open his camera and destroying the undeveloped film, Renfield explains why he does not want to kill Dees. You see, Dees, in his own way, is a vampire . . . a tabloid journalist who feeds on human depravity and tragedy by making his living on the stories he covers. Renfield sees him as a kindred spirit, but still threatens to swallow Dees whole if Dees continues to track him.As Renfield is making his escape, Dees chases after him, demanding to see his face . . . which we, the audience, have not seen, either, at least not in its entirety. Renfield complies, and we get our first real glimpse of an absolutely wonderful mask made by KNB. Again, one of the creepiest things I've ever seen.Renfield decides to feed Dees his blood, and there follows a hallucinatory, black-and-white, Night-Of-The-Living-Dead only with Vampires scene that comes to a head when Dees decides to use an axe to defend himself against this horde of undead creatures.Then, as the police enter, we transition to color again, and we wonder . . . was there really a Renfield, or did Dees actually do the killing to begin with? Was it really him all along? That question is answered for us, however, when Katherine, who has escaped the motel room and is on the scene, looks out a window and catches a glimpse of our vampire as his human-looking self. (We also know from a glimpse of pictures in an album he keeps inside his plane that Katherine looks very much like a woman he loved before becoming what he now is . . . was she with him in a past life? Does she feel an emotional connection to him because of that? We'll never know). The police are forced to shoot Dees when he comes at Katherine with the axe, and when one of them asks who he is, Katherine answers, His name is Richard Dees . . . we call him the Night Flier. Dees is dead . . . long live Katherine.A definite must see if you're a fan of King, Vampires, or both. Cheers.

Renfield complies, and we get our first real glimpse of an absolutely wonderful mask made by KNB. Again, one of the creepiest things I've ever seen.Renfield decides to feed Dees his blood, and there follows a hallucinatory, black-and-white, Night-Of-The-Living-Dead only with Vampires scene that comes to a head when Dees decides to use an axe to defend himself against this horde of undead creatures.Then, as the police enter, we transition to color again, and we wonder . . . was there really a Renfield, or did Dees actually do the killing to begin with? Was it really him all along? That question is answered for us, however, when Katherine, who has escaped the motel room and is on the scene, looks out a window and catches a glimpse of our vampire as his human-looking self. (We also know from a glimpse of pictures in an album he keeps inside his plane that Katherine looks very much like a woman he loved before becoming what he now is . . . was she with him in a past life? Does she feel an emotional connection to him because of that? We'll never know). The police are forced to shoot Dees when he comes at Katherine with the axe, and when one of them asks who he is, Katherine answers, His name is Richard Dees . . . we call him the Night Flier. Dees is dead . . . long live Katherine.A definite must see if you're a fan of King, Vampires, or both. Cheers.

He's actually quite vulnerable, if you look at his romantic relationship with Lt. Gwen Harper. And his mother is coming from Newark for a visit. This time, she didn't answer the phone, figuring it would be Joe telling her why she couldn't come.So when Joe arrives at the airport to pick her up, everyone is laughing at him. Even flight attendants. They've all seen the photos and heard the embarrassing stories. And on the way to his house, Joe has to help a man who is threatening to jump from a tall building. Don't worry--one of the classic moments in the history of comedy movies guarantees a happy outcome here.And Joe's mom witnesses a murder. This is after she has cleaned his apartment, pleaded with him not to do anything dangerous, and done everything else possible to make him feel like a second-grader. But she won't let anyone work on the case except her son--which also means she has to be his partner! How is this possible? She's so tough she won't let anyone scare her with threats of arrest for providing false information to the police. And Joe's mom can do it all! Watch her drive the car in a chase scene. And the movie's title is a line spoken by her son to a suspect.The amazing thing is that when he was 13, Joe was the strong one when his father died. So his mom knows what he is capable of. Her explanation of how he handled the situation gives the movie one of its several tender moments.I shouldn't have listened when people said this film was bad. I would have seen it so much sooner. Estelle Getty was great, and while Sylvester Stallone didn't seem quite suited to this type of role, he was good enough. I liked the character. But, yes, he can do comedy. Remember Oscar? I remember I liked him in that.I liked several other performances. Dennis Burkley as the big tough gun salesman (the one with the van), and Nicholas Sadler as the man on the ledge (I thought he was one of the Lawrence brothers!). And as always, Gailard Sartain as a big buffoon of a bad guy. And JoBeth Williams as Gwen.

You don't have to have an IQ of 75 to just relax and take it easy. Gump may have been smarter than most of his normal contemporaries. Contrary to what Jeanie said to him, he knows better than most people what love is. His loyalty to her in spite of the way she crapped on him until she was almost dead is a testament to that. Until the end, she was a dingbat.Forrest first lost his best friend Bubba in Viet Nam. Then, he lost his mother. Then, he lost his Jeanie. Through it all, he remained stoic. There is something very noble in that. Intellectually challenged or not, he was still a human being with feelings. He was smart enough to know what dead is, what right and wrong are.

This is an absolutely terrible movie from one of the worst directors of all time, Tobe Hooper. The plot, well, there is none. Hooper just throws in every plot device from every horror and scifi movie in a complete mess. Nothing makes sense at all. We have space ships (which are the cheesiest ones I've ever seen in a film) vampires, walking dead, telepathy, graveyards, an insane asylum, explosions, car wrecks, the military, stupid looking aliens; all that he left out was werewolves, Frankenstein, The Creature From the Black Lagoon and the kitchen sink. What a schizophrenic mess this is. Spoilers may follow There isn't any cohesive plot but I'll try to summarize what happens. The movie starts in space on one of the most ridiculous looking ships I've ever seen in a film. The ship picks up three bodies from an alien planet and they are brought back to earth. Three guesses what's going to happen next. The bodies are space vampires who travel into people by riding on a blue light (another totally cheesy special effect) and turn them into prunes by sucking all the lifeforce from them. The main vampire is a chick who appears nude in most of the film. It seems she has the hots for Steve Railsback who was one of the astronauts. She wants to mate with him for some reason because of destiny or some such crap. The film suddenly jumps to Patrick Stewart in an insane asylum for no reason at all. He is an alien too but they manage to kill him. Don't ask me how the film got from space to the insane asylum.

The ending shows a black alien spaceship that appears for no reason and disappears accompanied by swelling music. The End. The effects are cheesy, the main one being a blue stream of light accompanied by swelling music on a warbling soundtrack which is supposed to be the lifeforce as it travels into and out of bodies.

Again as always the world's greatest actor Jack Nichoslon holds true to form with another brilliant performance that's over the top he never holds anything back. The story is interesting, entertaining, and emotional Nichoslon is Robert Dupea a man who's gone against the grain and set out on his own with his only pleasure he finds is working as an oil rig, and on the side he loves to have fun and romance sleazy women. Karen Black portrays his girlfriend Ray and her character is just so pitiful and bad always, in a depressed and emotional mood you as a viewer get tired of her whining despite her sexy looks. Then after about thirty to forty minutes the film takes a change as we find out that Bobby left a family behind who were all musicians, that's found out during the scene when he meets his sister in the recording studio.

Really all in all the movie is beautiful from the scenes of Jack the way his character is so direct, and his screen time with both Black and Anspach are nice treats.

His previous movies had stories of course, but they were all so similar that they were hard to distinguish. Usually him getting revenge or something. This one features him as a cook with a secret (he is a butt kicking chef). The other factor that makes this better than his usual movie is the villains. You have Tommy Lee Jones and Gary Busey, both portray great villains here. It is nice to see a Segal movie that has some good actors in it. Well these villains proceed to take over this ship and of course our hero is not accounted for and fights to take it back with the help of a stripper who pops out of a cake in a rather sexy scene. Yes, this does sound a bit like Die Hard doesn't it? So that is that, a good action flick for the most part. Not that it doesn't contain any flaws, the final fight is particularly bad as it is very one sided, and we are talking about Steven Segal here, he is not incredibly bad, but he is not the best actor in the world either.

His previous movies had stories of course, but they were all so similar that they were hard to distinguish. Usually him getting revenge or something. This one features him as a cook with a secret (he is a butt kicking chef). The other factor that makes this better than his usual movie is the villains. You have Tommy Lee Jones and Gary Busey, both portray great villains here. It is nice to see a Segal movie that has some good actors in it. Well these villains proceed to take over this ship and of course our hero is not accounted for and fights to take it back with the help of a stripper who pops out of a cake in a rather sexy scene. Yes, this does sound a bit like Die Hard doesn't it? So that is that, a good action flick for the most part.

People who normally wouldn't read this sort of thing were not only reading it but quoting it. You could say that for some people it held the kind of camp appeal that bad books sometimes do for the so-called intelligentsia. Personally, I am inclined to think that its tale of middle-aged romance struck a cord. It may not have been well-written but many people recognized in its two central characters a reflection of themselves. It spoke of a great passion and a great loss; a Brief Encounter for the nineties. Still, it never quite seemed like a vehicle for Clint Eastwood; (once upon a time you might have envisaged Arthur Hiller doing it), yet here it is, larger than life on the big screen and utterly lovely, utterly heart-breaking.Perhaps Eastwood chose to film it as a vehicle for himself. He wears the mantle of the ageing Lothario perfectly at an age when most romantic leads are played by much younger men, (or are simply non-existent), yet who blanched when Gary Cooper or Cary Grant were wooing Audrey Hepburn well into their old age. Admittedly Eastwood isn't entirely comfortable in this sort of role. He's not a versatile actor. His best performances have been as tortured losers or just old-fashioned tough guys but under his own direction he blossoms here. Of course, the 'romantic' in Eastwood has never been hard to find. You need look only to the scores he has composed. (He has written the main love theme here and his use of classic jazz standards by the likes of Dinah Washington and Johnny Hartman adds considerably to the film's beating heart).What is remarkable is that essentially Eastwood's film is really something of a chamber piece for two players. A few other characters flit into the frame but for most of the time there is no one on screen but Eastwood and co-star Meryl Streep and this is one of Streep's great performances. As Francesca, the woman who finds in Eastwood's photographer Robert the one great passion in her life albeit briefly and at a time when the likelihood of such a thing happening was remote indeed, Streep is extraordinary. Sometimes Streep can overwhelm a project; her versatility doesn't always work in favour of lesser material. But here she seems to have tapped quite effortlessly, not just into the consciousness of her character, but into her very soul as well. And if that sounds cheesy, let me assure you it isn't. Cheesiness isn't in Streep's vocabulary, even if it is in mine! Perhaps Eastwood was able to discern in Robert James Waller's novel the seeds of a great love story or perhaps he just felt he could bring his artistry to bear on some unlikely source material. Whatever, it's paid off. On screen The Bridges of Madison County is a great love story; there won't be a dry eye in the house.
