Along the way, they meet many different characters each who have their own way of making funny stuff happen.The cast is great. There are numerous cameos by many great stars, Kenan Thompson, Kel Mitchell, Randy Quaid, James Rebhorn, John Goodman, Whoopi Goldberg and David Alan Grier all have their part to play in this witty satire.If you were a fan of the original TV show, then this movie is for you. It is also a good rent if you are looking for something refreshing and different or you are in a tight spot and need a kids movie.The acting is pretty hokey, but it is allowed because it only got itself up to a PG rating (because of one use of the word damn from the film's narrarator). This is a good movie, not anything like Oscar material, that's for sure. But it makes for a good change of pace. THE ADVENTURES OF ROCKY AND BULLWINKLE gets 3\/5.
