So i waited for the big Day .And went to the Theater ...Alone of course. And the Star Wars Title started rolling up along with the Great Fanfare of John. Williams..i didn't know what to expect,cause i had avoided every star wars trailer poster or whatever had to o with the Film. So the beginning was great a usually pan down and i space ship flying by.The first 20 minutes or so its all lighsaber battles ,you see obi wan young with his master and its very exiting.The visuals are great and all is fine.Than the movie starts to slow down when our heroes meet jar jar and save the princess.We finally meet r2 d2 for the first time and he saves the day.By this time i was still very exited about the whole thing.Enter anakin...well this was i guess my first moment when i started to say ,wait a minute...the acting of this little boy was not convincing,his tatooine accent was terrible American,compared to watto's.By the way i love watto's voice and Animation.I had thought that we would meet anakin way older and i was hoping for a little more Acting skills...i cant believe that over thousand's they choose this little kid.Well tha pod race really blew me away.but overall there was no character development ,obi wan had a couple of lines only...and thats like the main guy here.If it wasn't for Obi Wan ,Anakin never would have become so powerful nor Darth Vader.So i expected more story on Obi Wan.Not why jar jar was banished and nonsense talk like this. Well the movie went on and i got a little frustrated..i really was missing the old folks..and the Final Battle was exactly as the first and that sucked!!! Anakin destroying the Federation Comandship by accident was just to lame if you compare it to how hard it was to take out both death stars.Every time i watch episode 4 i still get nervous in the trench.So the day was saved by anakin this time.And he got accepted for being trained by obi wan.The Duel against Darth Maul is the best lighsaber duel ever!!! Even better that Ep3.When i went out of the Theater i was sad and confused..OK it was alright and it was star wars !! But not what i had dreamed about for years. Its a good movie for younger audiences and new star wars fan's but for people that grew up in 1981 like me it was a disappointment.

I love how Polanski lets his camera roam and linger about the massive apartment complex that is the film's central setting, making it the literal eye of the audience. I think maybe my favorite shot in the whole movie is when Rosemary (Mia Farrow) and Minnie Castevet (Ruth Gordon) are talking and she glances at the room where her husband, the appropriately named Guy (John Cassavetes) and Roman Castevet (Sidney Blackmer) are talking and we see only the vaguely sinister smoke drifting through the open doorway. I have a feeling that doorways and hallways in general have a symbolic significance in this film tied to its paranormal ruminations on pregnancy, but I'd have to rewatch it to analyze that aspect of the film.The story takes a little while to get going, but once we're into Rosemary's pregnancy the stakes begin to rise and suspense is unrelenting. There's also some great macabre humor thrown into the mix which reaches its apex in the film's famous shocker ending. It's a very atmospheric horror without any gore and with only minimal scares, to the extent that it reminds me of Jacques Tourneur's horror films (indeed given Polanski's status as a Francophile it's almost certain he had seen and been inspired by his films).The music is also very memorable; I was already familiar with the tune from the album by Fantomas with Mike Patton where they did a heavy metal cover of it, recommended for fans of this movie.But best of all are the performances from all 4 of the leads. Gordon and Blackmer are the highlight of the film for me with their wicked subversion of normal nice old neighbor type performances. Gordon of course was herself a brilliant writer and probably recognized the high quality of the material she was working with here. She's a fussy old lady who hides her true evil intent behind a blustering annoying façade of the old lady who's just a little bit too helpful. Blackmer is a good tonic to her high energy performing, projecting a reassuring feeling that greatly helps in the final scene when he gently rocks the cradle. The implication of that scene, that the maternal instinct will win out over all other reasoning, is powerful and ironic. Cassavetes isn't perfect but he is suitable in the role, the only one of the villains who actually had me guessing during much of the film's running time. And Farrow is a visual of gaunt helplessness, her eyes conveying fear and loss of control throughout the second half of the film. It's interesting that Polanksi says he initially envisioned a more corn-fed starlet in the role, specifically Tuesday Weld. In my opinion Tuesday Weld was a better actress than Mia Farrow and probably would have provided the film with an even more powerful feeling. It's true that Farrow looks perfect in the early phases of her pregnancy when she's losing weight and becoming paler, but she's already so thin in the first place that I think it would have been even more shocking to see Weld in the same situation. But I really can't fault Farrow's performance besides just the physical aspects of her screen presence which she isn't in control of. It's obvious that she and Polanski were on the same wavelength, and it's extraordinary how the male director and female star were able to make the character such a strong cipher for the audience.

Others praise Star Wars, living by it and its ideas that it garnished to do with 'The Force'. I never had any hostility towards Star Wars but I did toward the genre. Science Fiction has never been my favourite genre of film and likewise, blockbusters usually leave me underwhelmed and confused more often than not. The fact that Star Wars compelled me, kept me interested and above all entertained me then, is a fantastic achievement in itself.I just mentioned the word 'compelling' because that's exactly what the film is. Star Wars may be look upon as a 'fad.' or just one of those things where someone has come up with an idea that no one else has done before and then got rich off it through money and fans (Tarantino's Pulp Fiction may be a good recent example) but Star Wars is something more than that; it's a lesson in good and engaging story telling, interesting characters and fantastic settings. I remember seeing the recent prequels several months ago because they were available to me with the logic that if I watch Star Wars in chronological order, maybe I'll like the more critically bashed recent efforts more. Alas, Episode 1 was pretty good in my opinion but the second and third episodes stunk in terms of story telling, good characters and general interest. Seeing Star Wars now, I have come to really appreciate and acknowledge what this must've been when it first came out, what it must have been like to see something like this and be a part of it.It is clear Lucas had an idea in his head from the beginning which gives you an idea of the scope of his vision. There are numerous references to the previous episodes in the opening half an hour and it must've been both perplexing and fascinating for filmgoers to predict what it all meant at the time &#150; I felt spoilt watching and knowing what it all meant with audiences from 1977 in mind not knowing at all - when was the last time I felt spoilt during a film? This is all part of Star Wars' effectiveness. Whilst I don't think Lucas has achieved auteur status, I feel that his accomplishment as a filmmaker is more that cemented. Lucas has come up with these various types of alien species; he's shown us brief glimpses of them throughout the film, leaving us wanting more; he's given us the special effects that we want to see more and more of and he's taken everything to do with modernity of the time and contaminated it on screen with robots, laserguns and the now famous space Katanas (lightsabres to most people).But the films scope doesn't stop there.

But it's about more than Vietnam The Deer Hunter chronicles the effects of violence upon ALL people, not just those whom participate in it. I will be careful not to spoil or expose the crucial elements that truly make this film greater than the sum of its parts. We are pulled delicately by both the head and the heart to not merely watch but actually experience the normal, even mundane lives of steel workers as their relationships and the story unfold in a small Pennsylvania town. And maybe it all plays slowly at first - granted the film is not densely plotted - but that's precisely the point, because it's about the people, and not anything else. Amidst the awesome beauty of the Cascade mountains (a more than comparable filming substitution for the Appalachians) the iconic parable of the hunter poetically emerges, unifying the narrative and the roles these men play in each other's lives, and in the world. Then Vietnam. Three go in, and are irrevocably changed by 24 hours at a riverside POW camp...and you will be too. You will never be the same after these few scenes. This is by far the most psychologically intense sequence I have ever seen played out on film. Back home in small town PA the effect is much the same. The cold of late fall underscored by a haunting virtuoso guitar solo encapsulates the loss of innocence and the guilt of living in a world that seems broken. Relationships bloom and wither out of season, and again the hunter, the deer, and the bullet find solace and unexpected reckoning with one another. As the story again shifts to Vietnam, we discover that true insanity is not war or violence, but fulfilling a promise of love in the face of it. Beginning with a wedding and ending with a funeral, you will be devastated by The Deer Hunter. It has been said that the movie is about many things war, patriotism, violence, friendship, Nixon, religion...far too many topics to list here. And even if it is about any or all of those things, what makes this picture overwhelmingly moving and disturbing is the fabric of love woven through every frame. Although lauded by many technical awards, many of the more superficial, aesthetic characteristics such as cinematography, editing, and sound dubbing are either hit or miss (usually in equal shares). But this movie excels far above and beyond almost every other film made in the past 50 years solely by the strength of the material and the powerful performances. DeNiro for once is simply life-like (as opposed to typically being larger-than-life). Streep is complex and yet pleasantly provincial in this her second film.

Walken transforms from a character into a person...and through all of it, we can't help living inside their skin for three hours, because we all know people just like them...we ARE just like them.

But then it just got really corny and almost unbearably slow. Danes looks like a really rotten actress (maybe she is) and Hans Matheson as Marius is too weird. I remember seeing him in a pitiful remake of 'Doctor Zhivago' and laughing about how ugly he was. Looks aside, he still isn't great in the part. Cosette and Marius are very bland, their relationship doesn't make any sense to me. I see you, I kiss you, I love you sort of thing. Five second romance. Unfortunately, it dominates the latter half of the film. Val Jean and Javert kind of get lost. I couldn't make sense of anyone's characters, relationships or motivations.

It has now been over 7 ½ decades since it was first seen by the public, but it is one of those films that is still regarded as a classic. I must confess that I have never read the novel, so I don't know how this adaptation compares to it (some will compare this movie unfavourably, and it is apparently a lot different), but regardless, it has not failed to impress me.Dr. Henry Frankenstein is a scientist who is determined to create new life! He and his assistant, Fritz go to a graveyard and steal a corpse for the experiment, but Frankenstein discovers that they will have to find a useful brain elsewhere. So, the two go to a medical college, and after the class is dismissed and nobody is in the room, Fritz sneaks in and steals one of the brains. Unfortunately, Frankenstein is unaware of the fact that this is a criminal brain! Meanwhile, several people, including Frankenstein's fiancée, are concerned about the scientist and his experiments, so they go to his castle laboratory, where they witness the finishing of his latest project! Sadly, Frankenstein has just created a dangerous monster! As a horror movie, one would probably expect to find this movie scary. I'm sure it was considered very scary back in the day, but today, many could be disappointed to find that it is not so much so. This is understandable, as times have changed, and this film is obviously a bit tame compared to what is expected from contemporary horror films. However, I have now seen this version of Frankenstein three times, and although I have never found it very scary, I have still found a lot of it, well, intense, which is good enough for me.

However, you have to remember the fact that it took a long time for film-making to get where it is today (it has obviously been a gradual process), and this movie obviously can't do the same for today's viewers as it did for its original audience.

","genre":"Crime, Drama, Thriller"},{"date":"2 November 2007","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Despite what critics think, this is a Tarantino masterpiece with unforgettable characters, smooth and cool dialogue, and a shocking finale.Since this is a crime flick, the plot and storyline isn't that complex or deep, and there is no reason for it to be. It's pretty simple. Perfect strangers plan the perfect crime, but end up in a bloody set-up. With only four of them left alive, they must uncover the rat in the house. But which one is it? That is something they must find out before the cops get a hold of them in this unforgiving and spectacular crime\/noir movie.The writing is off the hook. Tarantino is a master when it comes to dialogue. Why? Because the characters talk like real people. In ordinary movies, all the characters ever talk about it the plot or scheme. In THIS movie, they talk about everyday normal things that we would talk about, which makes them seem more realistic and convincing. His writing reminds me a lot of Raymond Carver, except with more humour.The cast is terrific. Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Michael Madsen, Chris Penn, Lawrence Tierney, and Steve Buscemi all did their roles justice. Michael Madsen is awesome and cool as Mr. Blonde, who will always be remembered for that very particular role. Buscemi is hilarious, and your eyes never leave his sight when he's on screen.

Patrick Bergin is tolerable, but everyone else is seemingly doing the cue card shuffle. Matt Frewer does a Jim Carrey impression with a character that should, by all means be serious. People accuse Star Wars of wooden acting, yet this makes all the star wars films actors look like scholars. Next, on a movie that should be touted for special effects, this movie has none. When you can clearly see cardboard burning and made to look like a hallway you have a problem. Speaking of train wrecks, this film has one, and it looks terrible. There are plot holes galore as this movie's main focus is on this Cairon chip (whatever that is) which is never fully explained. Somehow the main character, Jobe, is able to coexist in both the real world and cyberspace at the same time. If anyone can find anything positive to say about this movie I would love to hear it. I will then gladly put that person into an insane asylum. ","genre":null},{"date":"2 November 2007","score":"2 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" Where to begin?

But it turned out to be on of the biggest flops I have ever seen. Unlike Becket the dialogue was filled up with imaterial and seemed to repeat itself. For example throughout the movie it seems that O'toole and Hepburn are in engaged in a major argument when suddenly it turns around into a love scene. I can recall of this happening at least 5 times throughout the movie. A second aspect to the dialogue was the relationships. The brothers were all forming alliances with each other King Henry II, Eleanor of Aquitaine, and King Philip of France. At one point of the movie I had no idea who was supporting who. For example there is a scene were all three brothers are conversing with King Philip, but each time one walks in the other starts to hide. Even King Henry the II walks in and suddnely it turns into a huge argument. Even in the ending provides no resolve to the movie when suddenly Eleanor of Aquitane and King Henry II resolve their relationship. I have no idea how this movie could win an Oscar for best screenplay.Another disappointing part of the movie was the acting. The brothers other than Richard (Anthony Hopkins) seemed to be out of character and did not show enough expression. King Philip (Timothy Dalton) seemed to be over the top. But that I could with stand. The performance that disappointed me the most was Katherine Hepburn as Eleanor of Aquitaine (especially after winning an Oscar for it). She seemed to struggle with her British accent. She also was very much over the top and wasn't very convincing as a Queen. She was a serious mis-cast. The two acting performances that held this movie together was Peter O'toole as King Henry II (who probably deserved the Oscar) who probably played better than he did in Becket because he was required to and Anthony Hopkins as Richard who played vet good as the son with a true desire of becoming king. Other than these two great performances, this great story was turned into a inconclusive and enigmatic spectacle.
