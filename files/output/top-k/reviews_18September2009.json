I don't know but before Tootsie, apparently. One of the most honest exchanges happens between Ron and Dorothy which might have ended differently if Dorothy\/Michael hadn't been dressed as a woman and hadn't been in love with Julie Ron Look at it from my side. See, if a woman wants me to seduce her, well, I usually do. But then she starts pretending like I promised her something- then I start pretending like I promised her something but, in the end, I'm the one that's exploited. Is truth a question of character-likability? If an ass speaks the truth does that make the truth untrue? Answer No. Ron is speaking TRUTH here.Dorothy Bullshit, Ron.Except that it isn't. In the deleted Chicken Soup scene, we see the same dynamic repeated with Teri Garr as the exploited victim and Michael as the exploiter. The idea is that they had sex and now Michael owes her a relationship. Why didn't Michael say it was just sex? Because if he did, he might have lost a friend over it. Should he have been honest RIGHT AFTER SEX and said it was just sex? Yes, but Sandy places the burden of that statement on him when Sandy could have made it just as easily herself. Typically, she's putting the burden on him to be honest because honesty is difficult. If it was easy, everyone would do it.Because why DOES Julie date Ron? He's a dick, he's insensitive, he's not sexy. Why is she seeing him? Why date a dick? If she's not exploiting him because she thinks he has power\/$$, why IS she with him? Because she's lonely? Fear of commitment? Job security? Opportunism? Stupidity? Someone to help support her kid? Yes, she's exploiting him and he knows it.At the cornball end of this pleasant film, Michael begs Julie to forgive him and she relents after making him beg a little. Boring. He's kissing her ass but more on that later.The other aspect of this film that I didn't love was Dustin's revelations about women. The only revelations he was entitled to were those pertaining to what it was like to be an ugly woman. Gina Davis and Jessica Lange are sexy women who have the power that go with that. Dorothy wasn't sexy so she had to find her power in a more honest place. Also, if it's a lot of work for women to be sexy, it's 72 times harder for a man pretending to be a woman to pull it off, so Dustin's appraisals weren't relevant there, either.Julie's problem in the film is that Dorothy is teaching her to be honest and not take the easy path of dating a bastard. What do you call a woman who dates a bastard because he has power? I don't know but the answer isn't a victim unless she's the victim of her own exploitation as Ron suggests. That, while she's exploiting Ron, she's also exploiting herself.Bill Murray is at his casual, comic best in this film with everything coming out of his mouth beautifully and easily. Not as easy as it looks, I bet.Teri Garr is sexy, cute and conflicted and my favorite exchange is when she's going in to audition and says to Michael, who is there to enrage her, wish me luck and he responds fuck you like the excellent actor\/enrager friend he is. He's not there to kiss her ass and wipe her tears, he's there to get her to a place where she can be an adult and not a whining baby\/wannabe.That's the kind of scene I like to see, the kind without a lot of counter-productive ass-kissing.Charles Durning had a great and important line re feminism that I'm too lazy to verify, to the end that all men aren't equal either which is in direct contradiction to the preamble to the Constitution.

Despite the violent content, the movie is not about violence. It's about feeling disenfranchised, cut off from society and a god you do not feel relevant to. Hell, it's about looking around you one day and realising that your surroundings all came from the same stylish catalogue. It's also very, very, very funny.Norton and Pitt are superb in their main roles, with Pitt having rarely been any cooler, and while Helena Bonham Carter has a tougher time her character's actions are explained more clearly by the time the final minutes pass by.

Then there's Jared Leto, not really doing too much on screen but everything he does makes quite an impact, whether being scarily compliant and subservient or being the brunt of Edward Norton's growing frustration.Utilising some fantastic CGI, featuring a great soundtrack by The Dust Brothers and with a sharp, witty script this all comes together sublimely thanks to Fincher's assured direction.

Are these crocodile tears? Does he have some second personality that does care? We'll never know. -I love the scene when Dorothy eats the rock cakes and melted silver, the gravity in her voice when, talking about Jack, says with little hope Maybe he'll be lucky, and the intimate moment she shares with Tik Tok as she winds his thinking. -I love the creepy bewilderment felt in the ornament room, Tik Tok's green tears, and the moment she hugs him. -I love the restoration of Oz, when she tells the crowd they're the best friends anyone could have, and when they say they understand, I love the pure heartbreak in her voice as she asks Do you? -I love and feel infinitely sad for Dorothy as she rushes to say goodbye to her friends, not able to fully do so as the screen turns white, then we see shots of the clouds, and finally the camera pulls back on Fairuza's gorgeous eye, already open, as her voice, filled with melancholy, murmurs a quiet Goodbye. -Finally, I love the final scene, as Dorothy sees Ozma in the mirror, her reflection, so she can finally live in both worlds, and finally she runs outside with Toto, and David Shire's score reaches its crescendo.This is how Return To Oz has touched me, and why it will always be one of my favorite films.

Their second film, Help!, made a year later by the same director, Richard Lester, was more ambitious, being made in colour and involving shooting in exotic foreign locations.

There is also a sub-plot about a mad scientist attempting to obtain the ring in his quest for world domination.Although as individuals the Beatles, especially John Lennon, all appear to have been witty and amusing, there is a big difference between being a wit and being a successful comedian, and an even bigger one between being a wit and being a successful comic actor. On the basis of this film the Beatles were not great comic actors, and there is no reason why they should have been. Those who are highly accomplished in one field are not always equally accomplished in others, and to expect the Beatles to have been a great comedy team is rather like expecting the Pythons to have been a great rock band, or like expecting George Best to have taken on Rod Laver in the Wimbledon final.The film also serves as a reminder (along with the Black and White Minstrel Show and TV comedies like Love Thy Neighbour and Mind Your Language) of just how politically incorrect the British entertainment industry could be in the sixties and seventies. Leo McKern's turn as the head of the cult, the great Swami Clang, makes Peter Sellers' performance in The Millionairess look like a model of cultural sensitivity. Like Sellers, McKern seems to assume that the main characteristic of Indian English (apart from an odd accent) is the tendency to exclaim Oh my goodness! at regular intervals. Although the Thugs were suppressed in the early nineteenth century, this film, together with Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, serves to keep alive the utterly mistaken idea that human sacrifice forms part of Hindu ritual. I suspect that if this film had been made a couple of years later, during the Beatles' Transcendental Meditation period, they might have been more respectful about Indian religion.A Hard Day's Night was a mediocre comedy, redeemed by its great music. The comedy in Help! fails even to rise to the level of the mediocre; it is unremittingly feeble and had this film been made by anyone other than the Beatles it would probably be ranked among the worst British comedies of the sixties. (Those comparisons with the Marx Brothers, the Goons and even Monty Python strike me as being very wide of the mark).

It is also at times visually inventive; the winter sports scene in the Austrian Alps, to the strains of Ticket to Ride, seems to anticipate the modern pop video. Nevertheless, the film has fewer great songs than its predecessor and contains some of the group's lesser-known items.

There is always a popular girl whose popularity derives from her beauty and her family's wealth rather from her personality, which is generally an obnoxious one. (The characters played by Charisma Carpenter in Buffy, Sarah Michelle Gellar in Cruel Intentions and Megan Fox in Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen are all good examples). The male equivalent is the jock, whose popularity derives from his good looks and sporting prowess and from his total lack of academic prowess, an intellect being a positive disadvantage in the popularity stakes. Those who possess the unwanted distinction of a high IQ are all bespectacled, physically unattractive nerds. There may also be a farouche, rebellious male outsider, cut off from the school mainstream but often attractive to a certain type of girl. Heathers is a black comedy which makes satirical use of all these clichés. It is set in Westerburg High School in the fictional town of Sherwood, Ohio, and features a clique of four popular girls known as The Heathers because three of them share this particular Christian name. (The fourth is named Veronica). Although the girls are notoriously arrogant, bitchy and snobbish, their beauty and their families' wealth means that the rest of the school look up to them. As their leader Heather Chandler puts it everyone in this school wants me either as a friend or as a sexual partner. (I bowdlerise somewhat).The clique's hold on the school is shaken by the arrival of a new boy, Jason Dean. Jason, who wears a leather jacket and drives a powerful motorbike, is the archetypal rebel, modelled on Marlon Brando's character in The Wild One (or perhaps on Aidan Quinn in Reckless). His name is an obvious reference to James Dean, the original rebel without a cause. Veronica, who is marginally more sensitive than the three Heathers, and from a slightly less elevated social background, finds herself powerfully drawn to the newcomer, and they begin a relationship.Unfortunately for Veronica, Jason turns out to be not just a rebel but also a psychopath, whose goal it is to murder all the most popular students in the school, making their deaths look like suicide. He starts with Heather Chandler and moves on to Kurt and Ram, two thoroughly unpleasant jocks, who are supposed to have died in a gay suicide pact. These deaths, however, have an unexpected side effect. Because it is associated with popular students, suicide becomes seen as cool and hip, and there are a number of copycat suicide attempts. Veronica now has to prevent Jason from pulling off his greatest coup- blowing up the entire school and making it look lie a mass suicide.There is something of a convention in American films of this type that the teenage characters are played by actors in their twenties or even thirties, but in Heathers most of the actors are around the same age as the characters they are playing. Perhaps this explains why the acting is rather more convincing than in a number of high school films; in Reckless, for example, I could never bring myself to accept Quinn as a schoolboy. This is the first film which revealed to me what a great actress Winona Ryder can be, and there are also splendidly over-the-top performances from Christian Slater as Jason and from Shannen Doherty, Kim Walker and Lisanne Falk as the three Heathers.Black comedy can be a difficult genre to get right; there are too many films which set out to be tasteless but hilarious but end up as simply tasteless. Heathers, however, which is funny, fast-moving and with a witty script, is one of those which gets the balance right, managing to deal with topics like teen suicide without ever seeming too crude. It reminded me of some of John Waters' films such as Serial Mom, another satirical black comedy about affluent American suburbia. (I note that the scriptwriter for Heathers is named Daniel Waters; are they by any chance related?) Another link between the two films is that both feature sermons in dubious taste given by manic preachers.Heathers does for the traditional high school movie what Blazing Saddles did for the traditional Western, and satirises the stereotypical way in which teenage life is portrayed by the American entertainment industry. It satire, however, is also aimed at wider targets. Westerburg High School is, to coin a cliché, a microcosm of society, and the Heathers can be seen as symbolic of all those who are admired not for what they are or for what they have achieved but for what they appear to be or for what they represent. When I saw this film again recently, for the first time in many years, I was surprised by just how fresh and relevant it still seems; it is hard to credit that it was made while Ronald Reagan was still President. With the empty-headed cult of celebrity even stronger now than it was twenty years ago, in fact, the film looks even more relevant now than it did then. If the likes of Heather Duke and Heather Chandler were real individuals they would today be featuring in glossy articles in Hello! magazine or appearing on Celebrity Big Brother. 8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"18 September 2009","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" American films and television programmes set in high schools seem to revolve around a few stock characters.

All the while, George (Sinise) tries to put himself between Lenny and those around him to protect his traveling companion.Based on the John Steinbeck book, of which I did not read, this is actually a pretty good movie with some pretty strong performances.In fact, the performances are the only reason to watch this movie. The entire cast is near perfect. Malkovich and Sinise has pretty good chemistry as the two lead characters. Personally, I liked Sinise better than Malkovich, neither of which are my favorite actors.There are also some strong performances from various members of the supporting cast. However, it appears that many of them were not given a lot to work with.If you have not read the book, you may not think that the supporting cast was given much. I didn't think so either since I've never read the book. Personally, I would have liked to have seen a few of the supporting characters more.There is some good chemistry with this cast, some better than others. You can really see where the chemistry was best by the scenes with the strongest performances.The soundtrack is completely lacking in this film. In fact, I think I remember only one piece of music near the end of this film. And it sounded like they turned the volume down on that little piece of music that is completely forgettable.The wardrobes, and other period pieces seen in this film, looks very authentic. It didn't appear that they tried to make it look like period clothing, it looked pretty authentic. They even went as far as making the clothing look like they were worn for some time, with little washing.There is no spectacular camera work in this film. There are a couple of foot chases in here with some quick editing. The lighting is used well, and the angles are done nicely. There's just nothing memorable in any of the shots.If you are looking for action, there isn't any worth looking for. This is pure drama, with no explosions or gun play.Maybe because I never read the book, I kept looking away from my computer screen (I watched it on Hulu) because I was getting bored.

In fact the character who is fond of making these utterances is the real-life Fritz Lang ( played by himself ). They are not Hallmark trifles but quotes from playwrights and he utters them not from a little book but from memory! Indeed, I don't think such a little book of quotations appears in the movie even once! Clearly the reviewer in question didn't know which character was which, what it was they were doing, or what in actuality ( rather than their imagining ) was happening on the screen.Several viewers refer to the alleged significance to the psychological play of one character leaving a second alone with a third. Yet in fact, the true weight of this is not demonstrable upon the basis of what we actually see. It is, on the contrary, only one of several conjectures uttered by one of the characters and is neither confirmed nor denied. Similarly, in another comment here we are told that one character despises another because he is selling-out rather than pursuing his dream. And yet in the actual movie ( as opposed to the version in that viewers imagination ) it is this character himself who declares this, not having it echoed or endorsed by any of the others.On the contrary, every clue as to the psychology of the relationships shown is carefully balanced with others in such a way that we are denied any so simple an explanation for what transpires. Just as the characters ponder and conjecture the psychology of Homers characters in the film they are making we are left to wonder which of any number of possibilities explains the relationships in this story! Which raises the alleged auxiliary narrative of the making of the film itself. Despite what at least one person writing here states, this tells us virtually nothing about the practical experience of the movie-making process. Rather, the movie-making process acts as a framework or scaffolding defining an abstract space within which the relationships unfold. Similarly, this sense of an abstract space, a virtual proscenium as it were, is made boldly and visually in the scenes that take place on the rectangular, flat sun-blasted roof of a building. It is so like a stage. It is accessed by the characters via a tiled flank that steps down in a broad stair-like manner reminiscent of the pedestal of a Greek temple. Echoing the Homeric themes of the movie the characters are working on.That so many reviewers can be so factually mistaken about what they think takes place in the movie, to the extent of confusing characters and conflating events, yet nonetheless resoundingly endorse it as a masterpiece poses very basic questions about the objectivity of their judgement.Had none of them been primed by the reputation of the Great Godard to expect it to be a masterpiece, perhaps they would either have thought otherwise of it, or perhaps even have watched it more closely. Dare I say, more appreciative of its genuine attributes.For this is a little recognised problem with the ready flow of hyperbole in praise of an Emperors Fine Robes. It actually deprives the artist of a fair assessment. I, among many, find myself encouraged by the all too abundant flow of automatic accolade by those who are keen to be seen as sophisticated by their appreciation, to be unduly hostile of the actual work even before seeing it.So I have to pause to take stock of the actual merits of this movie, rather than be provoked by the reactions of they who are blind to all but reputation.The principle strength of the film is in the very denial of an explicit narrative interpretation such as some writers here have referred to. The movie is visually flat. Most strikingly in the scenes in the apartment which uses the architecture of the interior to compartmentalise the characters into different boxes in a flat plane. Entirely consonant with concepts being explored in painting contemporaneous with the making of this movie. But the story is also rendered flat by the way in which insights into the psychology of the characters are offered and yet at once contradicted or withdrawn. Thereby creating an impenetrable cryptic surface of Human affairs that may seem to be an artistic conceit yet is on reflection, true to real life. In Hollywood's version of reality there is always one final narrative. In real life there never is. Nor is there in this movie. Watch it with an open mind as to what happens in those relationships, taking into account all of the evidence rather than just what fits your preconceived notions, and you will be forced to come to an open verdict. A position of irresolvable enigma rendered final by the tragic event near the end.At first my reaction to this, and its occurrence off screen was to think it a cheap shot. But it indeed serves this function of rendering the mystery of the story as to why one character reacts to another, irrevocable by removing one of those characters forever from the prospect of revealing that truth. As the character in question actually says in almost the preceding scene Not even death will force me to tell you.Overall, the film is of academic interest like a challenging piece of art in a gallery.

Echoing the Homeric themes of the movie the characters are working on.That so many reviewers can be so factually mistaken about what they think takes place in the movie, to the extent of confusing characters and conflating events, yet nonetheless resoundingly endorse it as a masterpiece poses very basic questions about the objectivity of their judgement.Had none of them been primed by the reputation of the Great Godard to expect it to be a masterpiece, perhaps they would either have thought otherwise of it, or perhaps even have watched it more closely. Dare I say, more appreciative of its genuine attributes.For this is a little recognised problem with the ready flow of hyperbole in praise of an Emperors Fine Robes. It actually deprives the artist of a fair assessment. I, among many, find myself encouraged by the all too abundant flow of automatic accolade by those who are keen to be seen as sophisticated by their appreciation, to be unduly hostile of the actual work even before seeing it.So I have to pause to take stock of the actual merits of this movie, rather than be provoked by the reactions of they who are blind to all but reputation.The principle strength of the film is in the very denial of an explicit narrative interpretation such as some writers here have referred to. The movie is visually flat. Most strikingly in the scenes in the apartment which uses the architecture of the interior to compartmentalise the characters into different boxes in a flat plane. Entirely consonant with concepts being explored in painting contemporaneous with the making of this movie. But the story is also rendered flat by the way in which insights into the psychology of the characters are offered and yet at once contradicted or withdrawn. Thereby creating an impenetrable cryptic surface of Human affairs that may seem to be an artistic conceit yet is on reflection, true to real life. In Hollywood's version of reality there is always one final narrative. In real life there never is. Nor is there in this movie. Watch it with an open mind as to what happens in those relationships, taking into account all of the evidence rather than just what fits your preconceived notions, and you will be forced to come to an open verdict. A position of irresolvable enigma rendered final by the tragic event near the end.At first my reaction to this, and its occurrence off screen was to think it a cheap shot. But it indeed serves this function of rendering the mystery of the story as to why one character reacts to another, irrevocable by removing one of those characters forever from the prospect of revealing that truth. As the character in question actually says in almost the preceding scene Not even death will force me to tell you.Overall, the film is of academic interest like a challenging piece of art in a gallery. So it might be thought of as part of Godards work in progress at that time. It has zero value as entertainment.

On the surface it may seem like an action movie, but when looked into more closely what can be seen is a deeply philosophical allegory on the concept of life. It's a gripping story of 'Blade Runner' detective Rick Deckard, hunting Replicants; robot slaves who have gone AWOL and returned to earth seeking one thing a longer life after being designed with a four year life span. The setting, a rain soaked, neon hazed futuristic 2019 LA oozes an overpopulated, multi cultured, crime ridden world, thus giving the film a more dangerous and seedy feel. It's a world that looks like it's been lived in for a long long time, and for a film made in 1982 was way ahead of it's time and still looks impressive today. The casting is pitch perfect, with Ford giving a strong, tough yet vulnerable presence as the uncertain Deckard, torn between killing Replicants yet falling in love with one. Rutger Hauer gives one of the best performances I have ever seen as the violent Roy Batty, who, though may seem frightening, evokes a sense of pity as the audience discover all this man really wants is more life. Rachael, the Replicant Deckard falls for, is played by Sean Young and she both succeeds in being absolutely beautiful yet giving off a robotic aura as she interacts with Deckard. The rest of the cast all put in amazing performances, notable mentions including Edward James Olmos as Gaff, Joe Turkel as Tyrell and the other Replicants.Vangelis' soundtrack fits perfectly with the setting created in Blade Runner, whether showing swooping dazzling cityscape shots, or dim close-ups inside Deckard's shadowy apartment. It's tones, ranging from mellow, jazzy piano and horns to tender electrical synthesisers complement all the scenes perfectly, evoking the dark urban world on display. Overall, for many Blade Runner is not only one of the best in science fiction but also one of the best films of all time. Considering it's difficult creation and eventful history, all the cast and crew, particularly director Ridley Scott, excelled themselves to bring us this wonderful piece of film-making that today still makes audiences question what it is to be human. I've seen things you people wouldn't believe. Roy's famous quote could indeed be repeated when describing what Blade Runner is and has become.

Kirsten Arnesen (Lee Remick) is a teetotaling secretary for one of Clay's clients. They meet, get married, have a daughter...and soon Kirsten is a hopeless drinker, just like her husband Joe.

This film is fantastic. While the overall plot is not very realistic, events which occur in the movie are. Many attractive affluent people DO get the breaks while the ones who work hard and are not 'the standard of beauty' get passed over. But 'Nerds' shows us that superficiality does not always prevail.But sadly, it does a lot of times. Just not in this movie, which is a good thing!And not just the 'superficial' aspect not just 'I'm hot'. There's this kind of violent attitude towards that which is different, and that has been going on in society forever. Plus the Alpha-Betas lying about various situations and 'playing the victim card'.All that said, I haven't read anything about how Lewis and Betty had become husband and wife for future sequels. But I may have just not paid attention. While I feel how Betty fell for Lewis was crazy, crazier things have happened. I did like how she pointed out how they fixed up their home to Stan.Now, is it just me or is 'Stanley' a pretty nerdy name?The Nerds also showed us how three-dimensional they were. The Alpha-Betas were one-dimensional and just liked to party and workout. The Nerds ended up being somewhat athletic, drank, had sex, got high, pulled pranks, and still had time to be brainiacs. And, as I said above, could be handymen.Remember, people The Nerds were the type of guys who ended up being successful and getting married. The Alpha Betas were the guys who after college were still hitting up on 18 year old girls and wondering why they're single 'because they're so awesome.Great flick, got mine at walmart for $5 and it's in my DVD player as I type this.Best characters were Lamar, U.N., and the Japanese guy whose name I can pronounce but cannot spell. Not an intellectually stimulating film but one of my top ten fave movies ever. I apologize for typos, butchering of the English Language, and the fact I do not professionally write reviews.

This film is fantastic. While the overall plot is not very realistic, events which occur in the movie are. Many attractive affluent people DO get the breaks while the ones who work hard and are not 'the standard of beauty' get passed over. But 'Nerds' shows us that superficiality does not always prevail.But sadly, it does a lot of times. Just not in this movie, which is a good thing!And not just the 'superficial' aspect not just 'I'm hot'. There's this kind of violent attitude towards that which is different, and that has been going on in society forever. Plus the Alpha-Betas lying about various situations and 'playing the victim card'.All that said, I haven't read anything about how Lewis and Betty had become husband and wife for future sequels. But I may have just not paid attention. While I feel how Betty fell for Lewis was crazy, crazier things have happened. I did like how she pointed out how they fixed up their home to Stan.Now, is it just me or is 'Stanley' a pretty nerdy name?The Nerds also showed us how three-dimensional they were. The Alpha-Betas were one-dimensional and just liked to party and workout. The Nerds ended up being somewhat athletic, drank, had sex, got high, pulled pranks, and still had time to be brainiacs.

The noise was coming from a favourite commercial radio station I was listening too at the time. Foolishly I thought OK I will go and watch it and shortly afterwards that was the last time I listened to this particular radio station. In short Muriels Wedding was the biggest waste of time and money I have ever suffered, well as far as films go, I did rashly back my football team at the time to win a trophy one year and unsurprisingly lost the modest bet I had made. This film is not funny, in fact for me it doesn't work on any level. The whole experience of watching this film was just embarrassing. I am perfectly aware that the people who put the money into the pot to get this film made were well intentioned and I am also sure that the film itself was made with the enthusiastic assistance of all of its professionals but the result is a turkey. By all means rent this film if you must but prepare yourself for a potential early pressing of the eject button. I genuinely cannot think of anything positive to say about this film.
