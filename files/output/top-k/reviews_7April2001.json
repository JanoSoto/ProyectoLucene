The music is particularly effective, and the look has a certain ominous feel even in the scenes where characters would normally be at peace with nature.This movie was so riveting and engrossing because it kept building up by revealing more about the mysterious main characters. It goes about doing this in a manner that makes the film more interesting by opening up possibilities instead of closing them. As we get more of an idea of who these people are, the tension mounts because we can see the movie is leading to a major disaster, but we aren't sure what and when.The flashbacks and transitions between the two main characters are so effective. The flashbacks slowly reveal what caused the characters current traumatized state (their main similarity is it's one parent, but they don't know of this similarity), while the transitions emphasize comparisons between the two. Hoskins performance is really the key because he has most of the lines. He does an exceptional job, changing a little bit with each revelation about his character. By the end of the story, he's nothing like the guy that you thought he was at the very beginning, but the changes are totally credible. Although I mentioned he has most of the lines, the most impressive thing about his performance is the believability of the emotions he's portraying throughout this dialogue because his character is one that generally doesn't say what he's really thinking and feeling. On some occasions, his intense feeling is really obvious. In a lot of others though, it's buried beneath the skin as the point is the topic of conversation or the other persons actions have caused something to stew inside of him but his character is trying his best not to boil over. Cassidy is highly impressive because she's able to convey the all the emotions without many lines, especially since all her lines are purposely delivered with the same unassuming nature and low key tone. As is one of the trademarks of characters in Egoyan's movies, she also has a dualism in her actions and words where we kind of believe more toward the opposite is actually true. We aren't really sure, but we can see that something is beneath the surface. It's hidden just enough so that the person she's with doesn't see it. Depth, subtlety, and what lies beneath are definitely the strengths of this movie and Egoyan's cinema in general.The movie really stands out because you could see how easily it would have been another boring and predictable thriller had it been made in Hollywood. Hoskins would have been much more narrowly defined so he could be a clear-cut villain. The narrative would have been dumbed down and told in a more conventional style. The director would feel he had to insert some happy or comical moments that would only water down the intensity and weaken the portrayals of these characters. The temptation to totally leave the psychological level and have Hoskins chase Cassidy around his house with a sharp object at the end would have been too great. Luckily, it wasn't made in the land of the rehash, so it was a somewhat challenging movie that stayed true to its roots from start to finish.Aside from leaving Canada, I don't see why people think this is so different from Egoyan's other famous films, Exotica & The Sweet Hereafter. The core ideas, style, and presentation are all here. Like those other two, this is an excellent film that's one of the years 10 best. 9\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"7 April 2001","score":"3 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":"  Egoyan's presentation really sets the mood for the film.

Everything was fine, until his estranged son showed up. He disregarded everything his father believed in he was a serious young man who lead a modern life, and considered bath houses to be passe. When Erming gets lost in town one day, he realizes how much his father and even himself, love him and rediscovers the importance of family.He also realizes that the bath house is not solely for relaxation it is the refuge for several lonely men. One is a portly man who constantly belts out Oh Sole Mio every time he enters the shower (who's voice constantly delights Erming). However, he is unable to sing them in public. Erming's constant approval eventually allows him to do so. Another prime example is a man who is unsatisfied with his marriage. He is told that there is an additive to one of the baths that will cure his impotency... instead, he finds his wife.Soon after, their father takes a turn for the worse, and suddenly dies.

Because a man that doesn't spend time with his family can never be a real man,' remarked Vito Corleone, played by Marlon Brando. By reading that quote, one might have thought that Vito was a virtuous and wonderful family man. However, he was the Godfather to the most powerful crime family in New York who dealt with murder every day. Little by little throughout the film, the viewer easily bought into the myth of the mafia the family togetherness and their rich traditional background. But, director Francis Ford Coppola also exposed the viewer to what actually goes on in the mafia death, blood, and calculated murders. Coppola used the elements such as camera angles, lighting, editing and dialogue to compare and contrast the myth versus the reality if the mafia in the scenes in the film, which were the events during Connie Corleone's (Talia Shire) wedding, the baptism of her child and the confrontation between Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) and his abusive brother-in-law, Carlo (Gianni Russo). Before the Corleone family lures the viewer in, they should take into consideration what is actually going on. \tA drastic difference between the reality and the myth of the mafia was blatantly expressed during the scene in which Connie Corleone got married. While everyone gathered around outside for a traditional, family oriented Italian wedding, the inside of their Corleone compound hosted crime negotiations between Don Vito Corleone and various members of his crime family. Outside of the compound, the Corleone family members gathered together to sing traditional Italian songs, wore traditional and classic wedding attire, danced joyously and took the family picture. Meanwhile, indoors, Don Corleone granted favors for the wedding guests, these favors often involving murder. To contrast the two scenes, Coppola implemented them with camera angles. Outdoors, the camera angle represented an onlooker and followed the festivities during the day. This gave a sense of belonging to the audience, and helped them `buy into' the myth of the mafia. Simultaneously, during the negotiations indoors, the camera angle represented Don Corleone's point of view. This made the viewer realize the intensity of the mafia and the importance of the role of the `Godfather' because everyone gathered around Vito and was humbled by his presence. Also, Coppola contrasted the scenes by the use of lighting. For example, outdoors, the lighting was very bright and there were barely any shadows. This created an air of happiness and showed the audience how the family made each other happy. In contrast, indoors, everyone and everything was cast in dark shadows to show the dark underworld of what was actually occurring in the mafia.  \tAnother scene that showed a comparison of the myth versus the reality of the mafia was the baptism montage. Coppola ensured that this scene was implemented by using an editing technique called parallel action, in which two scenes are shifted back and forth to compare and contrast. In this example, the parts of the scene undergoing parallel action were when Michael was witnessing his godson's baptism and when the murders of all of the Dons that Michael had planned were being executed. At the baptism, the Corleone's proved their family togetherness and showed their belief in God. Michael even renounced the devil and pledged his allegiance to the church. However, he knew that as he as saying this, the murders he had planned were taking place. The brutal murders obviously showed how fiercely protective the mafia is and also served as irony, considering that Michael was renouncing Satan as people he ordered to die were being slain. In the order that the scenes were placed proved how both aspects of the mafia were considered to be alike in some ways to Michael. For example, the dripping of holy water off the baby's head and the dripping of the blood of the victims and the crying of the baby and the murders blended together to show how they were perceived as being quite mixed up and distorted in the heads of the mafia. \tLastly, a scene that contrasts and compares the myth versus the reality of the mafia was the confrontation between Michael and Carlo after his child's baptism. Coppola accomplished this comparison chiefly by the use of dialogue. Michael explained to him how he knew of his beating Connie and his plan to kill Sonny. After Carlo obviously feared for his life, Michael gently explained that he would only banish him off to Las Vegas and that he wasn't allowed to partake in the `family business'. He then said that he would never make his sister a widow, rather kill the father of his godchild. This showed that Michael had family values and prioritized his family over his `family business'. Then, Carlo was escorted to a car, and then strangled. The reality of the mafia, in this case, was that they would deceive anyone to achieve revenge and wouldn't let anyone stand in their way, even their families. \tI believe that the mafia isn't all about killing and crime. The people involved truly believed that they were doing the best they possibly could to protect their families, even if that meant murdering people along the way. However, I admitted that while watching The Godfather, I bought into the myth of the mafia. I found myself legitimizing the terrible events that Michael had orchestrated because his was trying to carry on his father's legacy and to protect his beloved family. This was a product of Coppola's intent to create almost a `home video' from the Corleone family the frequent murders were as essential to them as their lavish weddings and their family dinners.

He then said that he would never make his sister a widow, rather kill the father of his godchild. This showed that Michael had family values and prioritized his family over his `family business'. Then, Carlo was escorted to a car, and then strangled. The reality of the mafia, in this case, was that they would deceive anyone to achieve revenge and wouldn't let anyone stand in their way, even their families. \tI believe that the mafia isn't all about killing and crime. The people involved truly believed that they were doing the best they possibly could to protect their families, even if that meant murdering people along the way. However, I admitted that while watching The Godfather, I bought into the myth of the mafia. I found myself legitimizing the terrible events that Michael had orchestrated because his was trying to carry on his father's legacy and to protect his beloved family. This was a product of Coppola's intent to create almost a `home video' from the Corleone family the frequent murders were as essential to them as their lavish weddings and their family dinners. So, if a viewer heard the quote, `&#133;a man that doesn't spend time with his family can never be a real man' might think that Vito Corleone is incredibly enraptured with his family&#133; but which one?

Mel Gibson plays a colonel who has decided that fighting a war is not the best way to gain something, but then changes his mind when the British kill some of his family members and are rather brutal in their methods.  To me this was a confusing film because it's not about Patriotism, it's not a history lesson about the civil war, but rather a way of putting a revenge movie in a different setting.  We are never given enough time or information as to why Gibson doesn't want to fight until after he starts fighting again. I believe the picture was trying to show that love for family should be greater than love for a cause, but I honestly don't think it did a very good job at this either.  Emmerich seems to have a hit or miss directing style and this one for me was a miss.  More dramatic than most of his efforts, but after this he probably needs to go back to mindless effects-filled action.

Even the title is a dead giveaway that we are about to be subjected to one of those unforgettable moral lessons that should be cast in bronze for the future generations to behold.  Which is too bad because I like the gentle quirkiness that Tom Hanks and Robert Zemeckis bring to the movies they do together.  One can almost feel the love they pour into their work well-thought-out, carefully crafted, professionally done pieces of entertainment.  Humble fables on a grand scale.  They consciously try not to insult the audience's intelligence or offend them in any way.  But the operative word I'm using here is consciously.  And, once we finally recognize what the moral of the fable MEANS, what it is is deeply disturbing.    Chuck Noland (Tom Hanks) is a time-obsessed overseas manager for Fed Ex whose plane crashes and gets stranded alone in a deserted island in the Pacific Ocean and, when he gets back, he finds that he has lost everything that mattered for him and helped him survive his ordeal.  Now, totally lost and alone, he must decide what road to take to go on with his life.  Not a bad idea for an adventure movie, even if they turned it into a silly no-brainer, which this movie clearly isn't.  Being that so, what happened? For starters, there is not one moment in Cast Away where I felt that anything was at stake.  Not once.  Since we know that at some point he will get back home (those fat exposition scenes at the beginning are ripe for some neat payoffs), we at least expect for something terrifying to happen to him while he is in the island.  And so we sit back and wait for those moments of transcendence to happen, those shocking instants when he suddenly realizes that he is alone, that he is mortal, that he will never be rescued, that he does not want to die.  We just don't want to watch him as he buries a dead body, opens coconuts, makes a fire, knocks out an abscessed tooth, or builds a raft.  We in the audience want to FEEL what is going on inside this man.  Those moments never do come.  Perhaps the most significant episode, where he tries to take his own life, is never actually shown (but rather explained later in the most naked, and weakest, scene of the movie).  What we end up getting is a gleam in his eye, a volleyball, and the sound of falling coconuts, and that last one is played for a couple of startlers and a laugh.  Hanks works very hard.  Harder than on any other thing he has done up to this point (production was shut for one year until he lost fifty pounds), and he IS impressive (he is a gifted actor); but he is (still) a lightweight actor, and he is paralyzed by the too-worked-out conception, this goddamned control-freak mania among filmmakers to tie every single loose filament together until there is nothing, not a single open space for us to walk into and rightfully reclaim as ours.  There is something else simmering under the surface of this movie.  Cast Away?  What it is being casted away?  Is it doubts?  Hopes?  Fear?  Jealousy?  Love?  Chuck Noland hated that island and returned to the white middle-class values he was violently torn off; he has ice in a glass again; his work; he lost his girl but still has another chance. At the end, we get our moment of transcendence, the conception this movie was working towards from the beginning Noland, alone in the intersection where the movie started, looks around at the four roads he has to choose from.  His brow is clean.  No words come out of his mouth.  What decision is he going to make?  Music.  Fade to black.  End credits. My guess is he doesn't need to make any decision he is Everyman we are meant to decide for him.  We witnessed his decency, concern, bravery, toughness, tenacity, and self-reliance.  He didn't really need anyone to survive.  We can do.  If Tom Hanks doesn't hurry up and cleans up his act he will turn into the favorite poster boy for the ultra conservative right. Book burnings and Nazi flags should be the next step.
