[{"date":"17 May 2000","score":"","review":"       Woody Allen has some good movies, and some odd movies.  The good ones will appeal to anyone watching them (SLEEPER, EVERYTHING YOU ALWAYS WANTED TO KNOW ABOUT SEX, and BULLETS OVER BROADWAY).  Then there are the films that people west of the Hudson River won't understand (MANHATTAN, CRIMES & MISDEMEANORS, and BROADWAY DANNY ROSE).  I'm kinda happy to say that Allen's new film, SMALL TIME CROOKS, will appeal to everyone, on both sides of the Hudson River.      SMALL TIME CROOKS has Allen playing a aging former criminal who wants to go back into bank robbing.  His wife (Tracey Ullman) who is a manicurist, thinks it's a bad idea. But that doesn't stop him, he gets his two friends (Michael Rapaport and Tony Darrow) to help him out.  They're going to buy a vacant building two stores down from the city bank, and sell cookies.  While they sell cookies as a cover up, they plan on digging to the bank and break in from the ground into the vault.  But when they want to buy the vacant space, it's already been bought by man who is a arsonist, (Jon Lovitz) so he can collect the insurance money.  So what could they do but include him on the deal.  Then the other problem arises, the cookies that the wife is making and selling, are a huge hit! Something that they didn't expect, and from there on it's a typical screwball Allen comedy.      SMALL TIME CROOKS is a decent Allen movie, the first half is Allen returning to his screwball comedy.  And that's the great part, it's so funny that I couldn't stop laughing.  It's similar to Allen's eariler comedies like BANNANAS, and SLEEPER. There are lots of physical and dialogue gags that are light weight.  Then by the second half, it sort of wears thin as it shows the difference between the high class societies.  But for a Woody Allen film, it's decent.      Woody Allen and Tracey Ullman both do respectable jobs in thier acting.  But Elaine May and Jon Lovitz steal the show in this film.  May is very funny as the ditzy relitive of Ullman who is a few cards short of a full deck.  And Lovitz is alsovery funny as the man who is included in on the deal at the last minute.  Plus kudos goes out to Michael Rapaport who tries to make robbing a cool image.     This is a film that most people over the age of fourty would enjoy, or those into movies.  But for those who enjoy their comedy with slapstick or sophmoric humor won't enjoy this. It's no AMERICAN PIE or ROAD TRIP style of humor, it's more intellectual.  Plus I don't know many people who can sit through Allen complaining throughout his films.     But this is lightweight comedy that does work most of the time, at least the first half.  Then like all of Allen's films the story takes a u-turn into something totally different than it began with.  This is a film to see if you're a Woody Allen fan or if you enjoy his films.  But if one too many New York City accents bother you, then see something else.  But since I'm kinda a Allen fan, it's enjoyable and one of his better films.  ***1\/2 (out of five)  ","genre":null},{"date":"17 May 2000","score":"","review":"       Woody Allen has some good movies, and some odd movies.
