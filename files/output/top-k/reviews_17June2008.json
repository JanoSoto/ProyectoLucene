Let me start off with how I came upon it; I remember it perfectly. I was staying the night at my sister's house one night, and it was after she and my nephew had fallen asleep that I had watched a few films already and still really had nothing better to do, but was not going to sleep any time soon. I was sorting through her DVD collection, searching for films I had not seen before, and luckily enough stumbled onto this film. I had never heard of it, and though this might sound crazy, I felt drawn to the film. I mean, I really loved the cover, and I really love a lot of Asian themed films, and so I read the brief description on the back of the case and decided it sounded decent enough to pass the time. Since it had Claire Danes, who I love in every movie she has been in, except maybe Romeo + Juliet which I had not seen at the time, I decided it would be entertaining. Giving this movie a chance was one of the best decisions I have ever made in my life, and I am not exaggerating. It is simply perfect, flawless, in my opinion, in every way possible and fully deserves any positive recognition it receives, plus all the other recognition it should have received and should be receiving now.First of all, it is executed so much better than any other film I have ever seen, and was so beautifully crafted and put together with perfect performances and poignancy that it makes my head spin. I was so entranced in the story and I am amazed at how perfect I believe this movie to be. It is sheer brilliance from beginning to end. It has the perfect atmosphere of intensity and brilliance that keeps me entranced in it from the get-go. The performances are perfect. Claire Danes does wonderfully as Alice, and her splendid portrayal was perfect with enough sincerity and an amazing climax scene that goes down as my favorite scene in cinema history. Kate Beckinsale is perfect, and her character, while annoying some reviewers, did not annoy me one bit. Bill Pullman is perfect, and I have never really cared for him at all. Jacqueline Kim is perfect. Lou Diamond Phillips is perfect. I could list the entire cast, but I am sure you get the point I am trying to prove by now.It has an excellent plot with authenticity and pain, rending the viewer helpless to submit to every kind of emotion they intend you to submit to. I love how it unfolds; them wanting to have a more memorable vacation by going somewhere exotic, meeting and becoming infatuated with Nick Parks or Skip, and then how they are thrown in jail for heroin that neither of them claims to know how it got into their luggage, and their lives are slowly turned upside down on a vacation that was supposed to be their last great time together. It is so achingly beautiful. I love the whole backstory at the beginning, and it immediately clicks with me and I know these two girls' lives and traits, which is why I care for them so much throughout the entire remainder of the film. It inspires sympathy in the utmost manner for them. Nothing is superficial or played out about it, because the way it is told is like everything is fresh and new to our senses. It is grotesque without being violent, it is heartbreaking without being depressing, and all the material you think is irrelevant is revealed as being important pieces of the puzzle little by little.All the troubles and faults that go on in the prison make me pull my hair out and grit my teeth. The cruel inmate that causes Alice to be punished, the failed escape, the cockroach in Darlene's ear. Those poor girls; I wish I could help them. It is not as violent as it could be, but it did not need to be to berelevant. I know this is sometimes compared to A Midnight Express and Return to Paradise, and a few other drug-smuggling in foreign regions films, but I can assure you, in my honest opinion, none compare to the brilliant execution and poignancy of this magnificent work of art. The soundtrack is even perfect as well. I love Rock the Casbah, Silence, Damaged, Party and then Deliver Me is positively beautiful, and a perfect song choice to an absolutely wonderful ending, which brings me to my next appraise. I am baffled by the movies last minutes. The best climax\/ending in cinematic history, and the most effective, in my honest opinion. The movie's ending made me cry my eyes out, but the song just added on to the tears. There is the cliffhanger that just makes this movie even more amazing. You never know if Alice did it or if she didn't, you just know she did what she had to do set her friend free in the end, and after all, that's all the matters, is it not? All of this does not even begin to explain how perfect I think it is. It is extremely underrated, not winning one award and is hardly conversed about in today's film society, and a hidden gem for anyone who has seen it and loved it. It is a beautiful, perfect movie with a powerful message and incredible entertainment value. It has been my favorite movie for awhile now, and I believe that I might not find another movie that I love as much as it anytime soon.

When I first saw this film several years ago I thought it was the greatest film I have ever seen, and I still believe that now.Goodfellas is the chronicling of the life and times of Henry Hill (Liotta) and his seedy underworld dealings with his dubious associates Jimmy Conway (De Niro) and Tommy De Vito (Pesci). It begins with with his entanglement with the mob, follows his rise to power and riches, then allows you to watch, as his whole carefully balanced life comes crashing down around him in spectacular fashion.What stands out for me about this film is that it does not rely on flashy special effects, extravagant pyrotechnics or a spot of the good old ultra violence (that said this film is by no means without violence), but it simply uses extraordinary story telling, a skill lost all too easily on most of modern cinema. It will suck you in right from the get go and grasp you to its greasy, mozzarella scented bosom right until the closing minutes when you are allowed to un-immerse yourself from the captivating portrayal of the life of a goodfella.Scorsese has without doubt been one of the best and most consistent directors and film makers of all time, everything he touches seems to turn to wonderfully gritty, seedy, gold, but I believe this to be his Magnum Opus above all of his other films and accolades throughout his career. He has a method of presenting the gangster genre I have yet to see be surpassed in terms of sheer entertainment value and depth. He also brings out truly top drawer performances from some undoubtedly great actors across the whole spectrum of the cast. Only this truly great combination of this directing, acting, and not to mention the realistic and natural scripting, could culminate to make the viewer feel some sympathy (mixed with a small degree of satisfaction at Hills retribution) towards a murdering, coke snorting, cheating mobster and all round scum bag.This film also boasts the infamous You think I'm funny? scene with Pesci providing a truly incredible performance here in particular. In a matter of minutes Tommy's character is encapsulated in emphatic style providing a brilliantly suspenseful and humorous peek into his psyche.I would recommend this film to anyone that has not seen it already, and if you haven't, why the hell not?! It's been out for 18 bloody years go and buy the DVD now!

I had not even seen Raiders Of The Lost Ark, i missed that at the cinema which was a shame. But seeing Indiana Jones And The Temple Of Doom in the cinema was a childhood pleasure that i will remember until the day i die. This film is amazing, even watching this on DVD doesn't quite capture its true entertainment value where it really belongs-the cinema. As I've stated in my review for Raiders, they should have re-released the Indiana Jones Trilogy worldwide just like George Lucas did with Star Wars in 1997. It would have made seeing the later fourth film even more mouth watering.Temple Of Doom has been accused of being 'very dark'. I'm sorry but so was Raiders Of The Lost Ark. ALL the Indiana Jones films have a true element of Darkness running through them. Raiders had the scene where Marion Ravenwood falls into a lair tomb of rotting corpses with snakes coming out of their mouths and The Last Crusade has Elisa Schneider looking on in horror as German Nazis burn every book they can that does not pertain to their Idealogy. Temple Of Doom also has a tremendous sense of humour that has you laughing at the disturbing bits-witness the terror in Indy's face as hes about to be stabbed and squashed by that sinking cave ceiling (one of this films funniest moments) You want to complain about the gore? So was the climax of Raiders! Certain bits of Last Crusade weren't for the faint hearted either. Why don't the Doom merchants (ho ho) just chill out and enjoy this masterpiece? Harrison Ford is fantastic in this. Hes also much more pumped up here in muscle than he was in Raiders. I always loved it how he had that long fight with the huge Thugee supervisor on that Rock conveyor belt, and ended up battered and bruised, shirt torn and looking 100% heroic in the process. When he shouts at Mola Ram (an excellent performance from Amirish Puri) to let Willie and Short Round go, he looks every inch the action hero. The set pieces in this film look real and are absolutely convincing to this day, The Temple Of Doom itself is also one of the most impressive cinematic studio locations i have ever seen.Special mention must go to John Williams for another memorable score. Temple Of Doom also has its own authentic theme just like Raiders and Last Crusade (with Indy's theme tune present in all three films) and its all about fun and adventure. The music playing throughout the Mine cart chase and the suspension bridge helps to thrill the audience even more. This is not only a classic film, it is also one of the greatest films of the 1980s, end of story!

But seeing Indiana Jones And The Temple Of Doom in the cinema was a childhood pleasure that i will remember until the day i die. This film is amazing, even watching this on DVD doesn't quite capture its true entertainment value where it really belongs-the cinema. As I've stated in my review for Raiders, they should have re-released the Indiana Jones Trilogy worldwide just like George Lucas did with Star Wars in 1997. It would have made seeing the later fourth film even more mouth watering.Temple Of Doom has been accused of being 'very dark'. I'm sorry but so was Raiders Of The Lost Ark. ALL the Indiana Jones films have a true element of Darkness running through them. Raiders had the scene where Marion Ravenwood falls into a lair tomb of rotting corpses with snakes coming out of their mouths and The Last Crusade has Elisa Schneider looking on in horror as German Nazis burn every book they can that does not pertain to their Idealogy. Temple Of Doom also has a tremendous sense of humour that has you laughing at the disturbing bits-witness the terror in Indy's face as hes about to be stabbed and squashed by that sinking cave ceiling (one of this films funniest moments) You want to complain about the gore? So was the climax of Raiders! Certain bits of Last Crusade weren't for the faint hearted either. Why don't the Doom merchants (ho ho) just chill out and enjoy this masterpiece? Harrison Ford is fantastic in this. Hes also much more pumped up here in muscle than he was in Raiders. I always loved it how he had that long fight with the huge Thugee supervisor on that Rock conveyor belt, and ended up battered and bruised, shirt torn and looking 100% heroic in the process. When he shouts at Mola Ram (an excellent performance from Amirish Puri) to let Willie and Short Round go, he looks every inch the action hero. The set pieces in this film look real and are absolutely convincing to this day, The Temple Of Doom itself is also one of the most impressive cinematic studio locations i have ever seen.Special mention must go to John Williams for another memorable score. Temple Of Doom also has its own authentic theme just like Raiders and Last Crusade (with Indy's theme tune present in all three films) and its all about fun and adventure. The music playing throughout the Mine cart chase and the suspension bridge helps to thrill the audience even more. This is not only a classic film, it is also one of the greatest films of the 1980s, end of story!

Taking his father's advice to work harder, we flash forward many years and Rodney opens up his own clothing store business called Tall and Fat. (Some very funny lines in this part of the film, when we see the ad commercial!) Meanwhile, Rodney discovers that his no-good wife is unfaithful at a party, and Rodney's son, played by Keith Gordon, is having problems fitting in at his college.Eager to help his son, and to instill confidence in himself, Rodney decides to visit him at college, and discovers that they can both help and learn from each other, so Rodney decides to enroll as well!!! He pulls a few strings by using the company funds from his Tall and Fat store to donate a new business building for the school. After being accepted by Dean Martin, (LOL!) Rodney's antics don't suit well with one particular professor, who intends on making life as miserable for him as possible. Meanwhile, he falls in love with the beautiful English professor who is not only teaching his Literature class, but also happens to be dating the business professor who hates him! Dangerfield struggles because all through life, the movie shows that he has been somewhat of a slacker himself. Using his business background, he bribes professional people to do his son's and his homework for him while rapidly becoming the campus party guy. His son Jason has trouble making the diving team, until Rodney pulls a few strings with the coach. Eventually, Jason becomes fed-up, because the entire campus learns what Rodney is doing. Jason wants to do his own work. Father and son have a big blow up fight about this, and the college administrator's determine that in order to prove evidence that Rodney did not plagiarize his work, he has to take oral final exams in all of his subjects.What I like most about Back to School, is that Dangerfield finally shows that he can be funny, without being obscene. There is a soft, sympathetic side to him in this movie that I don't see from him in other films. All of the supporting roles of Rodney's professors are very good. Rodney's jokes about his classroom and exam experiences, are well related from college students, especially if college was\/is a trying time for them.The only downside is the song Twist and Shout.

However, when I saw it on a large screen with a group of people ... wow! It was pretty awesome. Suddenly what seemed like a corny old musical for a different generation became lively, engrossing, fun and kind of magical.The overall story is about a film studio in 1927 that is in trouble because their big new film, their first talkie (sound) movie, sounds terrible. Their biggest problem is that the star actress (from silent pictures) has a voice that's pretty painful to hear. However, they find an innovative way to solve the problem ... but it's not without its own problems! At the heart of the movie is a romance between the studio's lead actor (Gene Kelly) and a new actress (Debbie Reynolds). It's complicated by quite a few things, but like the rest of the film, it's lighthearted and funny. I'm not really a fan of musicals or dance movies, but I thoroughly enjoyed both in this movie. The music is tuneful and is kind of a substitute for talking and self-expression; it's not done just to insert singing.As for the dancing ... well, I never appreciated Gene Kelly's remarkable physical prowess until I saw this movie. As mentioned earlier, one really should see this movie on a large screen to appreciate how intense his and his sidekick (the character Cosmo) physical movements are. Their dancing was spectacular and fun to watch. Like the singing, it was also nicely integrated into the movie.This movie was a lot of fun to watch and should appeal to just about everyone.

The terminator's job is then to hunt down the mother of the leader, Sarah Connor. But then, sent by John Connor, Kyle Reese. His mission is to protect Sarah from danger.The film is relatively exciting, but somehow i lost the tense and the excitement when i got deeper into the movie. People have been talking about it and said it's really good, so i actually thought i was about to watch a masterpiece.In my opinion, The Terminator is far from a masterpiece, but it's far from bad too. I mean Arnold did some decent acting, but then again he does play a robot. And the movie had 'some' Special FX that would even look good today. When i said 'some' i really mean it. Because most of the Special FX looks pretty lousy today, but i'm not going to judge the movie from that.So to conclude this whole review, if you like. I didn't really feel the movie.

Now I saw the chronicles of Riddick before seeing this one so I learnt the story backwards which was interesting. so I couldn't say I was too excited to watch it but I was given it for Christmas and thought I'd give it try. And it was nothing like I imagined it in fact it was the almost the complete opposite. I had a rough idea of the plot or so i thought, my idea of the plot was that a small crew along with Riddick himself were stuck on a planet with a bunch of man eating aliens and it would roughly be quite simular to Riddick 2. Oh how I was wrong in stead it turned out to be a Sci-fi horror! with a crew that gets nearly all picked off! Brilliant i thought and as soon as I got over the stunning opening scene i knew i was about to watch something completely different to Riddick 2 and overall and greater film. Vin Diesel's performance as Riddick is better than the second film but only just.

I got the DVD for my collection only because of Mr Lance Henriksen. This actor is terrific in the role of Bishop. Everybody else in this movie is so-so. Hollywood makes a simple shoot-'em-all action out of a freaking sci-fi concept. We have too little left to our imagination. The aliens are not so frightening any more. I'm sure it is a solemn result of Mr Giger's absence and the absence of Mr Ridley Scott. These two guys should have done it in a much more depressing manner. Aliens should have been depressing and shocking to the core.How would I improve the production? I would 1. diminish chat-chat jokes of the marines considerably (come on, it's no Renegade Justice); 2. not include aliens crowd scenes (many creatures don't necessarily mean more fear); 3. by no means show the scene with the queen laying eggs and a hundred of aliens running about (the viewer has been robbed and treated as a low-grade loser who has no imagination); 4. keep a few shouts away from the final product (cf. the one in the beginning when the astronaut is shown with a face-hugger attached to him and the kids start to yell); 5. make a more complex script with fewer real people and more androids to face aliens (sending a bunch of flesh-and-blood marines to fight the unknown beasts looks a bit lame and scientifically not justified).Bishop saves the production. Otherwise it would have turned into a cheap popcorn flick. Well, yes, it's damn near that category but Mr Lance Henriksen pulls it to a more decent level. You are the Man.7 out of 10.

I mean Robocop 3 lost the benefit of being an eighties action film so granted the violence and foul language would be toned down because suddenly the political correctness of the 90's was in full swing. So that meant making Robocop more family friendly. They also lost Peter Weller from the lead which I didn't realize how great he was as Robocop until he wasn't him anymore. I have to wonder if screenplay writer Frank Miller was angry at the creators of Robocop so he spun this tale as a cruel prank because Miller is no slouch at writing, he is a legendary comic writer (300, Sin City, X-Men, etc.) and the story for Robocop 3 borders on ridiculous. All of the dark gritty atmosphere is pretty much gone from the original film, the tongue in cheek political humor is gone as well despite some off attempts to do exactly that. And it is true what reviewers have said that Robocop has suddenly become a complete weakling. He spends so much of the film repeatedly falling on his robo butt and trying to get back up. He's lost all of his cool factor, all of his heavy hitting super hero instincts.Robert John Burke takes over the robo suit as Robocop and Alex Murphy. He just doesn't seem to have a handle on the character and doesn't give as much effort as Peter Weller did. Maybe it's because the first two films were so much better but Burke just isn't cut out for Robocop and spends most of his time trying to get back up on his feet. Rip Torn takes the helm away from The Old Man as head of OCP. Torn is a decent actor but he doesn't seem to have near the screen presence that Dan O'Herlihy had in the original films. They do mention The Old Man several times so to close his portion of the story. John Castle is one of the villains in the story as McDaggett, yet another corrupt OCP Officer working to rid the city of Robocop. He's okay, a little strung out and insane but decent enough. He doesn't hold a candle to previous villains in the series. Nancy Allen returns thankfully as Robocop's partner Lewis and the film does give her character something of closure so I give them kudos for that. Robert DoQui also returns for his third go around as Sergeant Reed and for the first time in the three films he really gets into the action which is terrific. Jill Hennessy joins the cast as Dr. Marie Lazarus who personally takes care of Robocop. Her performance is a little bland as she often is in her roles. It's a big cast with some decently memorable faces but I can't cover them all here.So here is why Robocop 3 is NOT the disastrously horrendous film that some make it out to be. First of all it ends the trilogy with a final big battle between OCP and the Detroit Police Department which essentially brings OCP down. It also brings back some of the familiar faces from the series and gives closure to the story on Lewis although her and Burke just don't have the chemistry that her and Weller had as partners. The story is decent enough and simple enough to follow but it just doesn't hold up to the previous two films. The entire aspect of Robocop flying is so ridiculous and they surely had to know that it was ridiculous. If it ain't broke don't fix it and they do fix the unbroken recipe which essentially ruins the series. It is true that Robocop 3 was a fall from grace and this film felt like the quality of a TV Movie which is maybe why all future Robocop installments hit Television.

But someone thought it would be a good idea to continue the hit series with a second sequel, something rarely seen in those days. Both Carpenter and Hill were uninterested in continuing the story of parts I & II and wanted to start fresh, which was the only way they'd be involved. Both acting only as producers this time, the film was written by not one but two writers, one of which wanted his name off it, and the other directed what is one of, if not the most hated film in the series. Why? Well many say because it has nothing to do with the rest of the series beyond title and genre, but do these alone make it a bad movie? Not at all. In fact, if you ignore those details and view III on it's own you may be pleasantly surprised. I know I was.Pros A cool opening title sequence. A scary and original concept. Good performances all around. Dean Cundey did a bang-up job on the cinematography for I & II and this one is no exception. Some truly disturbing scenes and images.

Sure none of their films, besides 'Halloween,' had been box office smashes, but they were successful critically and had many devoted fans. Like it's predecessor, 'Halloween II' did well for itself, but at the end it seemed that killer Michael Myers had met his maker. But someone thought it would be a good idea to continue the hit series with a second sequel, something rarely seen in those days. Both Carpenter and Hill were uninterested in continuing the story of parts I & II and wanted to start fresh, which was the only way they'd be involved. Both acting only as producers this time, the film was written by not one but two writers, one of which wanted his name off it, and the other directed what is one of, if not the most hated film in the series. Why? Well many say because it has nothing to do with the rest of the series beyond title and genre, but do these alone make it a bad movie? Not at all. In fact, if you ignore those details and view III on it's own you may be pleasantly surprised. I know I was.Pros A cool opening title sequence. A scary and original concept. Good performances all around. Dean Cundey did a bang-up job on the cinematography for I & II and this one is no exception. Some truly disturbing scenes and images. A different, but still very memorable score from collaborating composers John Carpenter and Alan Howarth. Writer\/director Tommy Lee Wallace does a good job of keeping things from getting too predictable. Good effects that have held up pretty well. A slow, but steady pace.

By a complete fluke machinist Eddie Kasalivich (Keanu Reeves) discovers the solution to make the process work, Dr. Barclay is an idealist & works for the good of mankind wanting the new process to benefit everyone. Unfortunately not everyone shares his views & a saboteur within the team organises an explosion which destroys all their work, Eddie & English physicist Lily Sinclair (Rachel Weisz) are blamed for the explosion & hunted by the FBI, the police & the evil organisation who set them up in the first place & want the secret of the process for themselves...Co-produced & directed by Andrew Davis one has to say that I was slightly disappointed by this rather routine & uninspiring big budget action thriller. The potential for a great film is there, a huge budget, several A-list Hollywood stars (at the time anyway), an experienced action film director & a fun central premise that had the potential to be an intelligent action thriller with a sound moral message about the need for clean efficient energy. Unfortunately what Chain Reaction actually is is a rather lacklustre instantly forgettable by-the-numbers thriller that doesn't even make for a particularly good popcorn action flick. The script by J.F. Lawton & Michael Bortman is also rather messy, there are several issues which aren't tied up to any great satisfaction as far as I was concerned. For instance it's never really made that clear who is behind the explosion & sabotage, sure there's this guy in a suit behind a desk but who is he? Why didn't these people just hire the team themselves under the pretence that they were developing the process for the good of mankind? Surely then after the process is perfected they could have killed them all off? Why did they think that blowing up all their hard work & killing their friends would convince the remaining team members to continue the research? There are too many scenes of supposedly sinister people in business suits trying to out evil each other, please do me a favour. The notion that machinist Reeves manages to solve the problems with the hydrogen energy process all on his own that an entire team of scientists can't by a complete fluke is also stretching the credibility a bit too far. Then the script puts the blame on big business, yet again it's the big businesses & the people who run them that are responsible for everything wrong in our society, seen it all before haven't we? The actual science in Chain Reaction is total nonsense although it does try to present an interesting reason as to why a cheap clean energy source may not be good in that the economy might crash but the idea is not developed beyond a single conversation between two people.Director Davis is more or less remaking his own earlier film The Fugitive (1992) as both feature a leading Hollywood actor on the run from a larger conspiracy & having to prove his innocence while at the same time avoiding capture, sounds familiar right? Here in Chain Reaction the one big difference is that there are two people on the run instead of one, unfortunately Rachel Weisz's character is given virtually nothing to do & apart from look good is totally surplus to requirements. Another disappointment were the action scenes, sure the explosion in the opening fifteen minutes is impressive but there after there's very little here to get excited about, there are a few dull chases which amount to nothing, there's a few fight scenes & another explosion at the end. The most notable aspects of these sequences are the settings which are impressive, from a huge frozen lake to a science museum & it's exhibits to an underground silo to a good looking scene set on a huge split bridge.With a supposed budget of about $55,000,000 Chain Reaction flopped big time at the box-office taking less than $8,000,000 during it's opening weekend. To be fair it is well made with impressive production values & has that glossy Hollywood feel about it. The acting is alright from a cast that is wasted on this, Reeves is OK, I have always liked Rachel Weisz who replaced Mira Sorvino when she pulled out but she looks uninterested & bored here, Morgan Freeman deserves better than this while Fred Ward is miscast as a tough FBI agent & Brian Cox has a terrible accent as the bland bad guy who was originally going to be played by Tommy Lee Jones until he was replaced.Chain Reaction is a throughly average action thriller, it has one or two decent moments & a much, much better cast than it deserves but even that can't lift it above mediocre at best with some poor plotting, unclear motives & a typical absence of logic.

This shouldn't be a surprise; the guy's been making them this way for most of his career, save for when he can't not have some semblance of a story (i.e. 1900 and Last Emperor, which were epics). It's got some purely luscious cinematography- thanks, in part, to the equally luscious and vibrant locations out in these Tuscan fields and villas and vineyards and homes, all secluded like in an over-elaborate dream- and some brilliant moments, though in the end it's almost something of a minor work for the director. The most admirable aspect is that he's able, in short, to make a contemporary movie that doesn't feel stuck in time.It's a 90's movie, with a hot-young-talent in her first role (I think it's her first), Liv Tyler, and in a way it works that she's not all that great in the part. Her awkwardness, her moments of sadness over her character's loss of her mother and the confusion over who her father really is, and the girlish and nearly overrated conundrum of still being a virgin, works to her ability as a 'first-timer', so to speak. And, luckily, she's surrounded by much better actors, people like Jeremy Irons who has a presence that is immense and cool even when bed-ridden for much of the film (thankfully it doesn't turn out how I originally thought the set-up would be with him wooing Tyler), and Rachel Weisz in one of her early roles as a woman who has reasonable suspicion her self-absorbed American husband is a lying\/cheating louse. There are others as well, like the one who plays the old Frenchman (I forget his name), who's incredible as the old crank who can't bear to be where he's at.If it does feel like a minor work, as I mentioned, it's that Bertolucci- working from his original concept with a screenwriter- doesn't give very much depth to the situation, or to some of the characters, until a little more than halfway through the movie. For a while it feels like a shallow enterprise, the kind of will she or won't she attitude towards sex that should be above him. But at some point there's something that opens up a little bit, then a little more, and all the while as Tyler's Lucy becomes more aware of what matters the central conceit starts to become less and less like some big hurdle and something more natural. As well as this, Bertolucci does litter his film, which is uncharacteristically good in the present setting (he blends musical choices very well, from alternative rock to old R&B and classical and jazz) and has a couple of really tremendous scenes. The bit at the party where Tyler and a possible-father dance and the dancers all choreographed and strange come in, it's enthralling.Fans of the director should check it out, as should for those of the actors, but this being said it's almost kind of a light work.

I earlier watched David Leans other creation Lawrence of Arabia and I must admit I didn't really like it that much as other critics have praised it. The difference in these movies for me is LOA being an epic story of a single man with run time of over 3 hours which at times make you feel bored whereas DZ is an epic story of not just a man (although he is a central figure); it is a depiction of a tumultuous history of Russia in early 20th century while revolving around the life of Dr. Zhivago in it, which makes you excited all the time as you are not following one man but following a country through different times. In a nutshell, the story is that Dr. Zhivago is a poet, an efficient doctor, very respectful among the countrymen, and although happily married is in love with another woman who was once married to another man. Story takes us from the early beginning of Russian revolution to the WW I, to the death of Tsar, and to the rise of Stalin in power. All that period in Russia was one of the most bloody one and extremely troublesome for the people in it. All this is shown in a flashback as Zhivago's brother (an army officer) tells all this to one woman who he thinks is a lost daughter of his brother with the woman he was in love with and wrote poetry about, Lara. Coming to acting Omar Sharif as Dr. Zhivago is very well cast, he does good justice to his role, Julie Christie as Lara is wonderful, and she looked amazingly beautiful throughout the movie and now I know why Al Pacino called her as the 'most poetic of all actresses'.

Other recommendations from me if you liked this movie and which also deals with some characters in the movie but takes us through certain period of time of that country, and they are 1. Siberiade and 2. Andrei Rublyov.

That's because this film succeeds completely remove the image of the mythical west full of ruthless murderers and men that were seeking how to impose justice ... and only shows us a reality where good and evil coexist within each person. There isn't a character who is not worth its appearance in this story, from the group of prostitutes who seek revenge claiming their status through the mythical murderers incapable of doing harm, bad guys converted into good ones and a sheriff whose sense of justice in his magnanimity. This whole gallery of characters are combined in a story that is spectacularly well told through an accurate direction and editing that combines all the elements for an ending that gives rise to a legend. But the value of Unforgiven is that from that moment we can consider Eastwood as a major film director, which unlike other actors-directors (Costner, Gibson, etc.) this is the only one who really has proved been prolific in his career and today stands as an artisan of the best dramas of recent years in Hollywood. So in Unforgiven we realize that the years not spend on free to Munny but we also see that on the contrary, thanks to those same years, this great actor has become one of the best icons of what is cinema by excellence. I can't say anything else that this is the best and unbeatable western of all times.
