Imagine having a tune halfway through the film, after which role of the detective chasing Murdoch was now played by another person (Murdoch's wife?). I think such variations would have offered greater insight into Murdoch's position and would have afforded the audience greater empathy with the characters.

It's made for those who already know the stories, the characters, and the universe.As such, it is an absolute joy not just to learn more of the beginnings but to actually SEE them. To see so many different worlds, different creatures and different situations is an absolute dream. To me, this is the first Star Wars movie that allows us to get a true scope of Lucas' vision of this far, far away galaxy.To those who criticise the dialogue, I can't argue. There are no snappy one-liners -- thankfully so. Jar Jar's lines can be annoying, but that is his character. Hell, C-3PO always annoyed me too, I never liked his dialogue. Young Anakin's dialogue is weak, but perhaps that's because it's written as a 9-year old (Jedi or not) would actually speak. Trust me, listening to all those yapping kids in line gave me insight as to how idiotic they'd sound while flying pod racers around.As for the plot of this movie and the pace of the storyline, I don't need dialogue or specific action to help me with this. The perfection and beauty of the visuals -- effects, costumes, paintings, sets and CGI -- are so remarkable they are a story onto themselves.And since when did Star Wars have a human element in it? The core of the series -- The Force -- is something that transcends species, that has both good and evil. Like the immersive audiovisual experience of this film, it's the thing that surrounds us and binds everything together.If you're a Star Wars fan this movie is nothing short of a joyous experience.

GODZILLA was horrible, ARMAGEDDON was only o.k., LOST WORLD was different, INDEPENDENCE DAY was silly, TWISTER was sillier, and BATMAN FOREVER was just plain stupid. Not since the original JURASSIC PARK as finally a summer hyped up film worth it.  And it had to take the brilliance and genius of George Lucas to save the summer movies with his latest installment of the famous STAR WARS films, THE PHANTOM MENACE. I'm guessing that some people aren't liking this film because they are either, A.) expecting to see something phenomenal and different  or B.) the greatest movie of all time.  I for one wanted to see something entertaining. And thank god I got entertainment! First of all, don't expect THE PHANTOM MENACE to be a full blown action\/adventure picture.  Like EPISODE IV, (the original STAR WARS to you and me) there wasn't much action.  It was more of a character and plot development film.  It took EMPIRE and JEDI to show the trilogy had plenty of action.  And I think George Lucas is going to have tons of action in EPISODES II & III. But we're talking about EPISODE I, and it's a very well done film. Lucas proves his imagination is still strong with the different planets and creatures.  Hs has some very spectacular action scenes, the pod race is a STAR TOURS style fun race, and the fight scene between Qun-Gon-Jin, Obi-Won, and Darth Maul is very tense and exciting!  By the way I forgot to mention that Darth Maul is one vicious S.O.B. Liam Nesson, Ewan McGregor, and Natlie Portman are all very good in their performances.  Yeah, they are kinda cardboard characters, but they try their hardest to make them real.  Jar-Jar Binks (the computer generated creature) is cute and funny (sometimes he's annoying).  And Jake Lloyd as Anakin is decent. However, sad to say, Lloyd is the flaw of the film.  I mean, Lloyd did a decent job playing Anakin, but he's too young!  Lucas should have a 15 or 16 year old play Anakin, not a 8 year old.  I can't believe an 8 year old boy, who hasn't gone through puberty yet, fall in love with a 16 year old beauty. That seemed a little unreal to me. Otherwise, is it worth the wait?  Is it as good as the other STAR WARS films?  Is it worth paying $7-$10 for?  Yes, yes, and yes.  It's well worth it.  It's not my personal favorite film of the year, but it comes close.  It is very entertaining, and that is all you should ask for.  I know some critics will say that they didn't like it, and they have that right.  I didn't like THE CRYING GAME, ENGLISH PATIENT, and USUAL SUSPECTS, and that's my American right.  Overall, EPISODE I is a delighful prequal to the classic trilogy, and I can't wait for 2002, for EPISODE II.  Is it a surprise that I give this film ***** (out of five)............. I guess not.

These two personas shift wildly back and forth throughout the movie -- in one scene, Ben is the consummate professional; in the next, he's a raving psychopath.  And let's not even mention the fact that he has Mafia ties.  A serial killer... with Mafia ties?The truth is, Man Bites Dog is not well thought-out.

It has stunning visuals, excellant acting by its major and minor characters and has an entertaining plot. Its poor critical response is due I think to the fact that this is the first Star Wars film that assumes Star Wars knowledge by those watching it.  Some of the best non-effect scenes in the film (read anything with Ian McDiarmid) are lost on those who don't understand that we are watching Palpatine's ascent to power--and that he, not the much-licensed Darth Maul, is the real villain of the piece. I don't want to put in to many spoilers to my review but it has been a long times since I've seen anything as droll and understated as Palpatine's last comment to Anakin.On the whole the acting is excellant--this is the best ensemble ever in a Star Wars movie.  Liam Nesson matches Alec Guinness' standout performance in the original Star Wars and Ewan McGregor and Natalie Portman are both likable and exciting to see on screen. In smaller roles Pernilla August, Hugh Quarshie, and Brian Blessed all give wonderful performances. The scene-stealer award must go, though, to the already mentioned Ian McDiarmid as Palpatine. His performance alone is worth the price of the show. If Mr. McDiarmid fails to at least get a Supporting Actor Oscar Nomination it will be a crime against great bad villains everywhere. Ray Park, Terence Stamp, Frank Oz and Samuel L. Jackson are all fine in what are basically cameo roles. I think I speak for the vast majority of the film audience in wishing for a few more moments of Mr. Park and a few more audio selections from Peter Serafinowicz (voice of D.M). A great secondary villain that we see too little of.This is not to say the film is perfect--I think Mr. Lucas miscalculated slightly by setting Anakin's age as 8\/9 and not a more suitible 12\/13. Jake Lloyd is in fine form when piloting a pod or ship and suitably stone faced while centerstage at the jedi council chambers but he can not (could any 8 or 9 year old?) make us believe that an emotional attachment could arise between an 8 yr old and a 14-year old. Natalie Portman tries her best to meet Mr. Lloyd halfway but for her too the premise will not work. At most her affection for young Ani comes accross as some form of misplaced maternal instinct. Indeed part of Ms. Portman's inability to make us believe a romantic attachment is that she plays her role (that of a young but smart and saavy Queen) so well. I personally found the much-maligned Jar-Jar Binks less irritating than I anticipated, but still irritating, thankfully he practically disappears during the second half of the movie.  One suspects that even George tired of his antics--Memo to George Please limit Jar Jar to a cameo in the next film--or if you have to have a Gungan as a main character use the vastly amusing Boss Nass.The above quibbles aside, The Phantom Menace ranks among the best of its genre and deserves a solid overall 8. I gave it one extra point because, with the exception of Roger Ebert, none of the major critics appeared to review the movie for what it was, but rather what they though it should have been. Lastly I gave it a final extra point (bringing it to a magic 10) for that amazing last reel--arguably the best last reel of any of the Star Wars films to date.

","genre":"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"},{"date":"20 May 1999","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" While TPM will not, in the fullness of time, be considered the best Star Wars film (ESB still holds that lofty position) it is certainly a peer of ESB and ANH and, IMHO, better than RotJ. It has stunning visuals, excellant acting by its major and minor characters and has an entertaining plot. Its poor critical response is due I think to the fact that this is the first Star Wars film that assumes Star Wars knowledge by those watching it.  Some of the best non-effect scenes in the film (read anything with Ian McDiarmid) are lost on those who don't understand that we are watching Palpatine's ascent to power--and that he, not the much-licensed Darth Maul, is the real villain of the piece. I don't want to put in to many spoilers to my review but it has been a long times since I've seen anything as droll and understated as Palpatine's last comment to Anakin.On the whole the acting is excellant--this is the best ensemble ever in a Star Wars movie.  Liam Nesson matches Alec Guinness' standout performance in the original Star Wars and Ewan McGregor and Natalie Portman are both likable and exciting to see on screen. In smaller roles Pernilla August, Hugh Quarshie, and Brian Blessed all give wonderful performances. The scene-stealer award must go, though, to the already mentioned Ian McDiarmid as Palpatine. His performance alone is worth the price of the show. If Mr. McDiarmid fails to at least get a Supporting Actor Oscar Nomination it will be a crime against great bad villains everywhere. Ray Park, Terence Stamp, Frank Oz and Samuel L. Jackson are all fine in what are basically cameo roles. I think I speak for the vast majority of the film audience in wishing for a few more moments of Mr. Park and a few more audio selections from Peter Serafinowicz (voice of D.M). A great secondary villain that we see too little of.This is not to say the film is perfect--I think Mr. Lucas miscalculated slightly by setting Anakin's age as 8\/9 and not a more suitible 12\/13. Jake Lloyd is in fine form when piloting a pod or ship and suitably stone faced while centerstage at the jedi council chambers but he can not (could any 8 or 9 year old?) make us believe that an emotional attachment could arise between an 8 yr old and a 14-year old. Natalie Portman tries her best to meet Mr. Lloyd halfway but for her too the premise will not work. At most her affection for young Ani comes accross as some form of misplaced maternal instinct. Indeed part of Ms. Portman's inability to make us believe a romantic attachment is that she plays her role (that of a young but smart and saavy Queen) so well. I personally found the much-maligned Jar-Jar Binks less irritating than I anticipated, but still irritating, thankfully he practically disappears during the second half of the movie.

I'll go briefly over what I didn't like about it, trying to avoid any spoilers along the way.Jar Jar Binks. This character was perhaps the single worst creation in movie history. I don't know WHAT George Lucas was thinking about here. Everyone I talked to after the movie couldn't STAND this guy. I've heard complaints about him even before the movie and well, once he appeared on the screen, the movie became nothing more than a cheese-ball festival. His manner of speech bordered on Jamaican and Chinese, and the accent was so indiscernible you couldn't even understand about 75% of the words coming out of his ugly mouth. He didn't single-handedly ruin the movie, but he certainly contributed to its failure.The plot. As opposed to what the critics say, this is NOT a children's film, based on the plot. It was muddled, confusing, and if I were a child I'd be sitting there without a clue of what was going on. Trade embargoes, taxation disputes, political fodder...it was all a mess. I don't know who Lucas was targeting with this movie. Little kids? No, they wouldn't understand the story. Adults? No, the action and humor were too immature and childish. It was like watching a cartoon, but mixed in with political wish-wash.The action. This movie tried way too hard to capture the magic of Return of the Jedi. It shifted to several parallel battles, just as ROTJ often shifted from Lando's raid on the Death Star to the Ewok's battle to Luke's confrontation with Darth Vader. Unfortunately for Phantom Menace, none of the battles were very captivating or interesting. OK, maybe the lightsaber duel with Darth Maul was ultra-cool, but all the other stuff was just there to fill screen time. In all, the film moved VERY slowly. They tried associating everything too much with the latter films and I felt as if they were trying to desperately CONVINCE me that this mess was somehow connected to the whole Star Wars universe.About the only redeeming quality the movie had were its actors. Liam Neeson was a great Jedi Knight and Ewan McGregor nailed his performace of Obi-Wan Kenobi. But extra special kudos to Natalie Portman who absolutely stole the show! Man, is she a little hottie or what??!! Little Annakin Skywalker also did a formidable job and Samuel Jackson was fun to watch as Jedi Councilmember, Mace Windu. But despite the good casting, the acting in this movie did not do a single thing to save the mess of a movie this was.The bad guys. Darth Maul was a menacing figure, alright. But we don't really hate him at all. His character is so incomplete we have no real opinion of him. He has one or two lines the entire movie! The rest of his scenes are comprised of him wielding his lightsaber lance (which was pretty damned cool, but that's not the point). The Viceroys were VERY VERY annoying. They couldn't speak a word of coherent English and we're left to try and decipher their mutterings as the muddled plot speeds on by. In all, the character designs in this movie were horrible. Besides Darth Maul, there were no interesting new creations whatsoever.So without getting into the plot or spoiling the film for anyone, this is the most complete review I can do with this movie. Perhaps I'll get into it more when people have actually seen the movie, but for now, just know that this movie was perhaps the single greatest disappointment in my movie-going career.

I was, because it could and never will live up to the lofty expectations that many, including myself, have placed upon it.However, it was a lavishly and meticulously crafted film made by auteur George Lucas and his creative teams. It features truly spectacular special effects and production values, incorporating stark and beautiful settings and incrediblly seamless computer generated images, including characters such as Jar Jar Binks, junk dealer Watto, and entire armies of Gungans and Battle Droids.There are great performances abounding throughout the picture, especially by Liam Neeson, as the rogue Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn, Pernilla August as the earnest and loving Shmi Skywalker, mother of the Darth Vader-to-be, and Ian McDiarmid as the charming, albeit scheming, Senator Palpatine.

I'm glad I waited to write this review until seeing it the second time. After the first I watched the movie I was going to give it a 3 or 4 out of 10, after seeing it again it looks like a low 6. The big question is did it live up to the hype? The answer is simply, NO.For fifteen years I waited for this movie and created an almost perfect movie in my imagination, so I guess I should have expected a let down. I have been spending the last few weeks trying to prepare for the let down, did it help. Yea, I guess it did.  I would have walked out if I haven't read all of those negative reviews. Why, you ask I felt disappointed, well for starters it is a movie intended for males 8 to 10 years old. Lucas is a brilliant businessman, luring in a new generation into his universe. But, what about the fan base of 20 something's that put him on the map? His thought, screw them.... That is what is seems. What does Lucas think? That we grew up to be mindless idiots. I'm sorry if I'm sounding harsh, but, waiting fifteen years for a 6 out of ten movie, I don't think so.If I had to guess I would have to say that Lucas never even saw the original movie before he wrote this movie. The pieces just don't fit.  Lucas will probably just try to mash them together in the next two films. I was hoping that when he sat down to write Star Wars, A New Hope, that he had some kind of outline put together. It seems apparent that he didn't. So why did he make A New Hope episode 4? I don't know. Will we ever know? May be we should call Mulder and Scully. Looking back at Empire and Return of the Muppets, I'm really curious if he had any idea of what he was doing. Don't get me wrong, Empire is one of my favorite movies. When he was writing Empire and Jedi, did he think to himself, I will make Darth Vader, Luke's dad and Leia, Luke's sister.  Did he realize the repercussions of this? I think that plays a major role in the Episode I. Anakin shows NO evidence of the dark side, other than Yoda's little speech about fear leading to the darkside.  At least in Empire, Luke had his confrontation with Vader on Dagobah, which show us the darkside of Luke.Another think about Anakin is that when he is reviewed by the Jedi Counsel, they say that he is too old to become a Jedi.  What about Luke? He is only like 10 years older than Anakin, and according to Episode I it takes YEARS to become a Jedi, and Luke does it in a few months!Some other question I have about the story line of Star Wars. What about Uncle Owen? What about the relationship between R2, C3, Anakin\/Vader, and Obi-Wan? Don't you think that the droids would have remembered Tatooine and Anakin when they met Luke? Lucas sure has original ideas, not. I like how Anakin was an Immaculate Conception. Cant' get any ideas?  Just take some from the bible.Enough about the story line. Time to pick on something else.  What about the direction? Okay, I understand that the last movie Lucas directed was Star Wars so he was probably a little rusty, but none the less the direction sucked. So did much of the acting. If I were a director of a large production movie I would have pushed my actors to do better. It seemed through most of the movie that the actors were reading their lines off a script they have never seen before. Did Lucas shoot the rehearsal and forgot about the movie? The scene and characters just felt empty. In Star Wars, the scene and characters jumped out at you and had a life of their own. In Phantom, you never really get attached to anyone. I think Lucas paid too much attention to his special effect and forgot to shoot half the real movie. There were very few well-made transitions in the movie. They would just jump around from scene to scene with out any real closer. I also felt that the special effects were OVERDONE. I like what he did with the background environment and some of the characters but there were some scenes that were just hokey. In comparing this film's quality of special effects to say the Matrix, I feel that the Matrix blew right on by. Using special effects to enhance a stunt is great. The Matrix did a great job at this, but Phantom, failed miserably. A lot of the jumping and falling looked fake. Didn't any of the animators take a physics class? Objects don't fall with a constant velocity. I could go on and on about other things, but I think I will stop here and go on to the stuff I did like. Oh, by the way they should have killed JarJar in the first 10 seconds of the movie.It was nice to see Jedi in their prime fighting. I thought most of the Jedi fight scenes were done well. I haven't seen good sword fighting like that since Highlander.  This excludes whenever they fight droids, which seemed to be a practice exercise and was not a real treat. It is worth the money to see the fight between Qui-Gon, Obi-Wan, and Darth Maul. I liked how they showed how the Emperor came to power and who he was before becoming the Emperor. That is all of the good stuff I can think of. Sorry it was so short.The second time I saw the movie I was able to ignore some of the flaws and enjoy the film. That is why I ended up giving it a 6 out of 10. If you ask me where I rate Phantom along with the others, first would be Empire (10 out of 10), A New Hope (8 out of 10), Phantom (6 out of 10), and Return of the Muppets (5 out of 10).
