[{"date":"1 September 2015","score":"","review":" Teaching Mrs. Tingle (1999) Dir Kevin Williamson \/ Cast Helen Mirren, Katie Holmes, Barry Watson, Marisa Coughlan, Jeffrey Tambor Dreadful horror film meant to represent dislike for unpleasant teachers. What is really being taught here? That revenge and blackmail are humorous comebacks that pays off? Mrs. Tingle is a cruel minded teacher bent on failing students and how she caught the smartest girl in the class with a cheat paper, which was planted on her. Three students travel to her home in hopes of reasoning but it all ends with tingle being tied to a bed in a lame scene involving a crossbow. It is crude, vile and hopelessly dumb. Lame idea brought down by predictable and juvenile storytelling. The concept worked in Nine to Five where three office secretaries kidnap their boss, but that film had wit and characters to root for. Not so in this junk. Kevin Williamson directs as if spoofing from experience. Helen Mirren is much too talented to be playing a woman as unsympathetic as Mrs. Tingle. The roll is about as broad as most slasher film villains. Katie Holmes, Barry Watson and Marisa Coughlan are despicable as the three students who give viewers no reason to believe that they should have ever left grade school let alone graduate. Jeffrey Tambor is a gifted comedian stranded in this cruddy garbage as Coach Richard. Message misfires thanks to complete idiocy.

His friends include a rabbit named Thumper and a skunk named Flower and all is fun and games until the reality of adulthood set in. Intriguing social commentary symbolizing the risks of raising children. Forest fires indicate carelessness, and hunters represent uncertainty of death as with Bambi's mother. Sexuality merges when Bambi battles a stag for a mate. Directed by David Hand who previously made the first Disney animation Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. Here he provides a greater achievement with harsh realism. Voice talents include Bobby Stewart as Bambi while Stan Alexander voices Flower, and Peter Behn voices Thumper. Cammie King provides the voice of Bambi's future mate Faline. Paula Winslowe provides the pivotal role of Bambi's mother whose fate is long past being a plot spoiler. It is a teaching tool but not for the intended audience. Parents may wish to view this film with their children since its adult themes are solid. It regards growth and adulthood and the unpredictable future. It is also about youth and adulthood with hints of romance. Top notch animation whisking viewers into the carefree forest of untold dangers.

But instead, each scene contains several dramatic pauses interrupting exchanges full of blatant plot-explaining dialogue which leaves much to be desired in terms of chemistry.The execution in making this movie clearly just sucked. The essential premise of death being led around to explore the mortal world doesn't end up teaching us anything about life and death other than how much we apparently undervalue the taste of peanut butter in our world (I wish I were joking).Watch this movie only if you feel like cringing.
