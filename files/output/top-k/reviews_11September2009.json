[{"date":"11 September 2009","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" 'Hideous Kinky' initially gives the impression of being a movie about a woman's adventurous and spiritual journey when it is actually about her journey to self-discovery. MacKinnon captures the landscape of Marrakech beautifully. The wild exotic culture looks authentic. The cinematography and music blend superbly with the overall mood of the film. The director makes the viewer feel like a silent observer and travelling companion of Julia and her children. I loved how her relationship with Bilal was portrayed as a beautiful friendship based on love, compassion, kindness and in the end, sacrifice. Kate Winslet does a phenomenal job once again. Said Taghmaoui does an equally convincing job but unfortunately, he still remains an underrated actor typecast in terrorist roles. It's a pity that Hollywood does not offer this actor much else to do. Child actors Bella Riza and Carrie Mullan deliver some of the better performances by child actors. 'Hideous Kinky' is an adventurous movie in the true sense of the genre. It's not an 'Indiana Jones' or 'Pirates of the Caribbean' type experience but rather something more layered, subtle and profound. Think of a kinky summer holiday about self examination somewhere exotic and less known.
