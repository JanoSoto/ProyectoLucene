Unfortunately, rarely - if ever - does Braindead get the serious attention it deserves.More than just blood and guts, the theme of this film is trying to control something that has gone totally wild and which is unaccepted in normal society, to the point where it becomes a shameful taboo. The solution that Lionel, the main character, finds for this problem is by facing up to this overwhelming danger, and by doing so, freeing himself from his fears.The zombies act as metaphors in this. They are monsters, but they still resemble people. Only when Lionel sees them for what they truly are, is he able to release himself from their iron grip. His mother is the most obvious example when he has to poison her, he can't do it, because to her she is still his mother.The frantic way in which everything is filmed, and the over-the-top quality of the violence, reflect this subject matter. The viewer has to look the frenzy right in the eye.I can hear you thinking come on, this movie is so outrageous, how can you even begin to find something serious in it? True, this is a really outrageous film. Outrageousness is its main ingredient, to be exploited and enjoyed for its own sake, just like the stereotypes (the mother, uncle Les, the priest - who, by the way, reminded me very much of Terry Jones' Monty Python character The Bishop).

I know nearly nothing about making movies and know even less about drugs. So instead of singing praises for how well this film portrays a certain kind of lifestyle, or for discussing its artistic merit, I'll restrict my comments to experience watching the film. In short, it was boring.The film has very little plot. It's quite evident from the beginning that it sets up a parallel between drug abuse by the mother of the main character, the main character himself, and his friends. The film makes it quite clear that it'll track their comings and goings as they sink further into addiction and watch the substance of their lives slip away. It tries to weave these parallel stories together in a way that dramatizes their experience. It turns out that this is not a really engaging way to arrange the events of an film. It's kind of, well, boring.The film uses lots of dizzying imagery to, I suppose, express what the drug-influenced characters may be feeling. These effects irritate the senses. There's nothing interesting about watching a character on screen act kinda crazy and see his fridge come to life. Similarly, it's not fun to be subjected to erratic camera movement or any of the film's other visual effects. When time is condensed and the camera moves about the scene swiftly, the viewer is often left remembering why he or she doesn't spin in offices chairs for fun because being dizzy is not enlightening or interesting, it just makes one feel sick.Let me close by saying that I really don't understand the drug film genre.

Or I never forget a face... Especially when I've sat on it. (also Turner) These are the kinds of lines we get to hear in this movie. It's yet more sexual lunacy from the most sex-obsessed director of the last three decades (not counting Russ Meyer). Russell presents a bizarre combination between wacky sexual-situation comedy, family drama, and psycho-thriller. The movie goes in all sorts of directions, and seems to be about a lot of things - with sex (what else?) being the unifying theme in all the issues. There is both intentional and unintentional humour, though with Russell you can't always tell which is which, but most of the film is a sort of eccentric drama.The characters of Turner and Perkins are absurd and over-the-top, respectively; Turner is a career woman who works as a prostitute during the night, while Perkins is a deranged wanna-be minister with mania written all over his face. At the beginning, Perkins so overdoes his part (as is typical of this incompetent over-actor) that you can't help but laugh. Turner, though playing a far-fetched character, is quite convincing, and very charismatic, as usual. Turner's character is the writer's idea of what a woman, who has been emotionally hurt by a failed relationshit, might do to deal with her disappointment in male-kind (i.e. mankind) she turns to fulfilling (male) fantasies as a prostitute. That'll happen... The idea that Turner - who has sex all the time with various men - would suddenly get emotionally aroused with a customer (Laughlin) just because he feels for her or whatever, is preposterous, though not annoying. In fact, nothing seems to be annoying in the film, in spite of it being Russell's.Well, almost; Russell took one or two themes from Dvorak's New World Symphony and milked them for all they're worth. These melodies are played over and over and over, in varying styles. Strange, because this music doesn't in any way suit this film. Some dialog sounds unnatural, some is silly\/comical and loaded with sexual word-play, and some is right out of a TV soap-opera.Perhaps the funniest moment was when Turner, while rummaging through Perkins's bag, finds a powerful-looking metal dildo and asks him whether it's a cruise-missile.

It's yet more sexual lunacy from the most sex-obsessed director of the last three decades (not counting Russ Meyer). Russell presents a bizarre combination between wacky sexual-situation comedy, family drama, and psycho-thriller. The movie goes in all sorts of directions, and seems to be about a lot of things - with sex (what else?) being the unifying theme in all the issues. There is both intentional and unintentional humour, though with Russell you can't always tell which is which, but most of the film is a sort of eccentric drama.The characters of Turner and Perkins are absurd and over-the-top, respectively; Turner is a career woman who works as a prostitute during the night, while Perkins is a deranged wanna-be minister with mania written all over his face. At the beginning, Perkins so overdoes his part (as is typical of this incompetent over-actor) that you can't help but laugh. Turner, though playing a far-fetched character, is quite convincing, and very charismatic, as usual.

That'll happen... The idea that Turner - who has sex all the time with various men - would suddenly get emotionally aroused with a customer (Laughlin) just because he feels for her or whatever, is preposterous, though not annoying.

Some dialog sounds unnatural, some is silly\/comical and loaded with sexual word-play, and some is right out of a TV soap-opera.Perhaps the funniest moment was when Turner, while rummaging through Perkins's bag, finds a powerful-looking metal dildo and asks him whether it's a cruise-missile.

Some commentators seem to suggest that's necessarily a bad thing. Nothing says films have to be linear, straight line things - and you can bet that anything Tarantino is involved in probably won't be.I was a little surprised when what started out to be a taut and thought-provoking brutal crime film noir turned into a comedy vampire flick, I'll admit. Didn't see it coming at all. But, was I offended or feel cheated? No. Both 'halves' of the film were enjoyable in their deferent ways. Tell you the truth, Tarantino's character in the first half was SO evil I was actually wondering if I could sit through another forty or fifty minutes of such tautness waiting for him to harm Juliette Lewis in some way. That is, of course, just a tip of the hat to Tarantino's writing skill.Not that the film didn't try to at least tie in the vampire slash-fest at the end with the thriller at the beginning. For example, Tarantino's evil, sex-crime, murderer was at least killed, in his turn, by a woman (a sex crime in itself) and so there is a measure of poetic justice (well, a lot of it if you think out how each of the characters dies I guess) in all of this.This is definitely one to just kick back and enjoy, though. Too much introspection will ruin it for sure. The music is terrific and Clooney is possibly the best I've ever seen him. Don't slag Tarantino off of for acting either, he's pretty good in this - more for what he doesn't say than what he does.In short, halfway through this film you think you're watching something special and are going to get value for money and, in the end you do but maybe not for the reasons you think at the halfway mark. It's a film that is ultra serious and, in fact frighteningly horrifying, at first and then just laughs the crap out of itself and the horror genre for the rest of the time. I think (and I'm no expert) that Tarantino and Rodriguez are saying here that REAL LIFE is far more terrifying than HORROR. If so, they hit the nail on the head perfectly.Very hard not to like.PS Cheech Marin (of Cheech and Chong) plays three parts and they are all a hoot.

For full effect, despite the tales of of praise and greatness the film has attracted, it's still far more rewarding to enter the experience with a relatively open mind - to simply sit back, and let the story, characters and each little intricacy wash over you, making your own assessments. Fear not - you will not be disappointed. At first glance, American Beauty might appear to be just another one of those realistic and touching portrait of an average family films which continually seem to coax far more awards out of the Academy than they are worth. No. Stop that train of thought right there. Because American Beauty may be a portrait of a family, yes, but it keeps up no pretenses of normalcy - rather how normalcy is a quality only represented through elaborate fronts to hide how excessively abnormal most families are, and how, quite frankly, it makes them far more interesting and compelling. The film's tagline ...look closer for once manages to overcome the pretentious glitz of most promotional material, and actually serves as a suggestion when viewing the film. At first, the characters may seem mere archetypes, simply passed off as messed up or weird, but honestly, such a judgement can never truthfully be made until this simply masterful portrayal has reached its conclusion, as new lights are shone on this incredibly elaborate and painfully genuine web of characters. Each character in the film, without exception, appears noticeably flawed, yes, but out of their flaws, real people emerge, complete with the depth and personal intricacies which movies are so seldom able to capture. Never once does the film ring of anything except absolute truth - these are real people we are watching here, and that is what makes them so compelling, unsavoury qualities and all. Director Sam Mendes (winner of the best director Oscar) kick started his now stellar career with this one of a kind masterpiece. Working with screenwriter Alan Ball (who also won an Oscar), who allegedly wrote the script as a play first (the influence shows throughout) Mendes is able to show remarkable depth, and rather than passing judgement on any of the players, simply presents them as they are, making stereotyping and assumptions impossible. But apart from the remarkable truth Mendes is able to retain from his actors, he also demonstrates a wonderfully artistic touch, and an almost unparalleled flair for innovative cinematography, which justifiably also took home an Academy Award. The recurring motive of roses is simply unforgettable, and although it may seem bizarre at first, there is no denying the unquestionable beauty - much like the rest of the film, in effect. Perhaps the one of the best and most truthful ensemble casts to grace the screen in ages, we never once see actors on-screen but merely the characters they inhabit so completely. Kevin Spacey gives the performance of his career, perfectly essaying every inch of Lester Burnham, and turning what might have been passed off as a typical mid-life crisis into something extraordinarily vivid, his usual charisma glinting between nearly closed eyes. It's unlikely that halfway through the film a single viewer will have not had the urge to strangle Annette Benning's Carolyn Burnham, which is a testament to how well she inhabited the role of the superficial, possessive wife. Yet by the end of the film, once again, judgement is reserved as she, as well as the rest of the characters, instigates a complete change in our opinions - the film culminates with no real villains, Carolyn included. Thora Birch gives a subdued yet charismatic performance as the family's troubled daughter, and Wes Bently is simply superb as the offbeat next-door neighbour, with a twisted yet genuine appreciation for beauty. Mena Suvari of American Pie fame is a noteworthy presence as the young girl who attracts Lester's attention, and Chris Cooper truly shines, there is no better word for it, as the painfully uptight and traditional military father of Wes Bently's character. All in all, American Beauty is one of the strongest character studies to grace the screen in recent memory, and arguably in film history, deserving every Oscar and award it achieved. Still, the enormous amounts of praise the movie has attracted aside, it's still surprising how affecting the movie actually is, and how incessantly it sticks with you, days, weeks, months after its initial viewing. Safe to say, this is one for the ages, and if you have yet to experience American Beauty - don't be afraid to.

It is very well made and won 11 Oscars. It is far better than the old films about the disaster. The acting is excellent and the effects take your breath away. It wouldn't have been any more realistic if James Cameron had commissioned a shipyard to build a full-scale working replica of the ship. The film is very authentic with just one minor lapse, namely the American locomotive and rolling stock on the dockside railway seen in front of the Titanic in the view from the pub. Unlike previous films about the Titanic there is no sense of impending doom throughout the film. There is a good feeling in the first half of the film, with scenes like Jack and Fabrizio at the bow watching the dolphins while Captain Smith looks on paternalistically and the ceilidh in steerage that Jack takes Rose to. James Cameron conveys the sheer size and stability of the ship very well and the audience is drawn into the very deep security that the passengers felt. Everybody on board is very friendly apart from certain individuals in First Class. Cal Hockley is a violent overgrown spoiled brat monster child. In a lot of scenes, particularly where he shoots at Jack with a handgun, he is reminiscent of the caddish upper class villain in a silent film. Jack has been criticised for being too 1990s but the rest of the cast look and act right for the period. The crew talk authentic sounding Edwardian English. James Cameron has caught the feel of the period very well and he has said that the people in the film are in many ways not that different from us today.

Kate Winslet, with her full curvy figure which has got her a lot of period roles and the nickname Corset Kate is spot on as Rose. The scene where Jack sketches her nude is very touching and the piano music that accompanies it is lovely. When they run past the stokers one can feel the scorching heat of the furnaces. After the ship strikes the iceberg the audience has much the same incredulity as the passengers and most of the crew that there is a possibility of the ship sinking.

One really feels the freezing cold when Jack and Rose are in the water and I felt sad when I saw the dead baby in its mother's arms. When I saw the film in the cinema I can remember hearing a couple of girls crying during and after the sinking. James Cameron says he deliberately made the ending ambiguous and his answer to the question of whether Rose dies or is dreaming at the end is You decide. I think she died and went to Heaven and was reunited with all these people she'd known on the ship. It is a beautiful scene where she's reunited in Jack and she's all in white like a bride. Hey!

The sinking, as it was in real life, starts very gradually and becomes progressively more terrifying. Although there is no blood or gore shown it still is horrifying. The only blood during the sinking are the scenes where the stewards get punched. There are some really sad scenes during the sinking such as the drowned woman floating in the water and the Irish mother telling her children the old Celtic story of Ossian and Niamh. It is sad when Fabrizio is killed by the collapsing funnel and when Tommy Ryan is shot by First Officer Murdoch in the heat of the moment. Incidentally, 20th Century Fox sent one of their executives over to Scotland to apologise to the people of Dalbeattie, Murdoch's home town, about the way he was portrayed in the film. One really feels the freezing cold when Jack and Rose are in the water and I felt sad when I saw the dead baby in its mother's arms. When I saw the film in the cinema I can remember hearing a couple of girls crying during and after the sinking. James Cameron says he deliberately made the ending ambiguous and his answer to the question of whether Rose dies or is dreaming at the end is You decide. I think she died and went to Heaven and was reunited with all these people she'd known on the ship. It is a beautiful scene where she's reunited in Jack and she's all in white like a bride. Hey! I'm going against my own principles. I'm one of the most unromantic guys in the world! I'm not supposed to like these scenes!

A dork, by definition is a polar opposite of a nerd, someone so afraid of being uncool that every decision is based upon what other people think, which of course makes them the most uncool of characters. This movie centers on characters that would fit right in with Barney Fife and Ted Baxter. A young guy, who we learn later is the dork of dorks, has a map to a supposed Paradise on an Asian island, and he goes there with a Frenchman and the Frenchman's girlfriend. The Frenchmand, by the way is one of the only two characters with an IQ over 10. The other one is an unsavory sort who warns the dorks (an unheeded warning) that just because the super dork killed a five foot shark, don't take his goofy babble, about being one with nature and commanding all sharkdom, seriously. The three young people take a high dive into water they don't know the depth of. In real life a best case scenario would be instant death, but more likely hitting a rock, being paralyzed, and dying in anguish. This reason alone would make this movie unwatchable. Before that, they go bananas over a marijuana field in such a way that you see many people do, the kind of people who worship Cheeck and Chong, the kind you never really believe are that excited, but merely hide their true emotions with goofy babble. Then they find the field is guarded by gun toting locals. After the dive they come across some of the ugliest people you ever saw. Just physically repulsive. Island life does not show well on most Caucasians. The ugliest woman in the world is the leader. She's almost as mean as she is ugly. She has no leadership qualities, no charisma, nothing. Yet people attack on her command. The trio isn't there twenty seconds before the rut gut ugly woman tells them they can't leave. Of course, that is kidnapping, and an older guy would immediately slit her throat and the throats of everyone else who kept him from leaving, because this place is clearly some kind of Hell, and there is no saving grace to it. None! No appeal at all, unless you were to run off the dorks. Its hard to imagine even kids accepting this, but maybe that's the way the filthy rich spoiled types think. And these are all filthy rich spoiled types, richer than anyone you probably ever met. (They had the money to gallivant across the globe nonchalantly.) One of the trio thinks he is forced to make love to Miss Super Ugly, and you'd feel sorry for him if it wasn't for the fact that her blackmail didn't make sense. Add to this the fact that the marijuana growers know this group of pompous pot smokers is there smoking up their profits, and are undoubtedly thinking of a way to control the business for themselves, and you have a laughable scenario. They might let some vagabonds stay there, or some poor locals, or some retired people, or anyone who has no interest in the marijuana. But to believe they'd let the people most likely to snitch, crowd them out, and take over their business, is impossible to believe under any circumstances. These dorks would have been eliminated from the game of life two seconds after they were discovered. The only saving grace is that the movie does show that the kids are dorks, and the place is a Hell. Still, the plot lacks any semblance of credibility, even in the world of Fantasy.

De Palma's unique illogical style has, evidently, also come from Hitchcock. I suppose that Hitchcock is analyzed to death and over-praised in film courses at universities, but the opposite should be done they ought to explain to film students just how bad an influence this fat little Englishman can be. Hitchcock is clearly a director without vision. By this cliché term I am referring to a concrete picture of what shape and form a movie is going to take. For example, Kubrick's films never drift into side-streets they always remain on course and on target. Hitchcock, on the other hand, can't even decide if he wants to make a spy thriller or a comedy. This film starts off as a mystery, and a half hour later we are faced with a fight scene in the train's luggage compartment which is pure 100% slapstick! This meandering between thriller and silly comedy never gels - simply because it can't. Comedy thrillers do exist - but movies which switch from one genre to the other come off all wrong.But the film's main flaw is the afore-mentioned illogicality. Plus the absurdity, far-fetchedness, and some silly coincidences. When Lockwood sees Froy written on the window she hastily tries to draw the disbelieving Redgrave to it; but, alas, the train - just at that moment - passes through a tunnel, and somehow the writing on the window disappears when they exit the tunnel (damn predictable, too). (Apparently this is a ghost story as well as a comedy\/thriller\/slapstick comedy.) Then there are the absurd reasons given to us why all the passengers who are not involved in the conspiracy won't testify that they did indeed see the old lady before she vanished; the male couple refuses to co-operate with Lockwood because they want the train to come on time, in time for a cricket match! (This is meant to be hysterically funny. Ha ha.) The other couple (man\/woman) refuses to involve themselves; the man does not want to be a witness and appear in the newspapers (for some very tiresome movie reasons). The woman (in this couple) later decides to testify in spite of not seeing the old woman herself, and then lies about the wrong woman, and, and, and... bla bla bla - a whole lot of nonsense ensues (I don't have to get into it).Just the fact that the whole thing is a conspiracy says everything; conspiracies almost always lack credibility and are rarely handled intelligently in movies. Then comes another dumb-as-dirt event the nun - who is in on the conspiracy - turns against her fellow conspirators when she finds out that the old lady is English. Well that certainly makes a lot of sense, now doesn't it!!! This nun is willing to work against her country's government, but just because the foreigners want to kill the old English lady she switches sides - in a jiffy! She'll sell her homeland, but she won't take part in the killing of one single solitary British citizen! Hitchcock seems to think his audiences checked their brains at the door of the cinema. (Then again, Chubby's movies are so popular that he perhaps wasn't so far off the mark with that assumption. Treating your viewers as morons has paid off for a number of film-makers.) And so the nonsense continues... The last twenty or so minutes are just a muddle of partly predictable, partly unpredictable - but always silly - plot twists, silly dialog, absurd situations, etc. Basically, the last twenty minutes are a bit of a mess. Just a couple of examples (out of many) the cricket fan gets shot into the hand and doesn't so much as blink! (Apparently the bullets used in the 30s just stung a bit.) Another one the rich guy (who refused to support Lockwood's claim of the old lady's existence) then decides not to tolerate the ensuing shoot-out between train passengers and the foreigners, so he marches out of the train, carrying a white piece sign - and very predictably gets shot. As predictable as the shooting of the nun (yes, that's right the nun who inexplicably switched sides, just for the fun of it.) In this last part of the film the typical 30s machine-gun-style dialog sounds particularly silly.The film is by no means bad; it's fairly entertaining (up until the last part), and has some charm, I suppose. But I simply cannot stand it when the parts of my brain, the ones in charge of logic, get continually hammered, over and over.

The plot jumped from drama to romance to suspense and so on, not giving you too many threads or clues as to what's really going on. Thing is, if you lack the proper patience, you lack the tools to fully realize the masterpiece that director Cameron Crowe has created for us here. Vanilla Sky chronicles the strange events that occur to one David Aames (portrayed accurately by the ever so talented Tom Cruise), a 33 year-old New York playboy, who's lavish lifestyle and reckless behavior is about to take a sudden and extremely violent twist. Aames is the sole inheritor of a publishing company and a real lady's man. After encountering the beautiful Sofia at a party (Penelope Cruz, who also became Cruise's real-life partner for a while at the time this movie hit theaters), David seemingly has a reason to finally settle down and let go of his hectic manners. Unfortunately, that's exactly when reality comes around in the shape of Julie, a hurt and neglected ex-lover who's determined to settle the score with him once and for all &#150; thus denying him the chance of love and happiness he took away from her so abruptly. The jaded lover (Cameron Diaz, in an eccentric and unconventional role) takes David on a highway to hell, driving them both into a tragic car accident. When David wakes up, his face is deformed, his ownership of the company is at risk, and he's haunted by whatever has happened to Julie. Our hero has to grow up and adjust to the harsh reality quickly, or else he'll lose what little he has left. However, adapting to the new status isn't as easy as it may seem. Something has changed in his post-accident life, and he can't quite put his finger on it. Whatever it is, it all comes down to the choices he made after the accident, those turns of fate that now come back to haunt him, thrusting his life into a nightmarish reality &#150; if, indeed, you can call his existence a reality&#133;Throughout the film, Tom Cruise plays the tormented David with such accuracy, you really believe he's going through all these highly surreal events. In the end, without spoiling the film entirely, it's all about the way we handle the choices we make in life, and our never ending pursuit after the things we want the most. It's that bittersweet feeling you can always open your eyes and take the other path in life, that also made me return to this film and watch it over and over again throughout the course of the 5.5 years that went by since I first watched it in theaters. In time, I found many comparisons between the film and the general feel of this decade &#150; which Vanilla Sky captures best. When Cruise's David loses his looks and becomes old real fast, it's the filmmaker foreshadowing our need, as a society, to wake up and face our problems instead of running away from them. The mixture of genres also blends well into this theory, as none of us really know how to approach the historical shifts all around us. When David runs through the empty streets and passes the abandoned Times Square, I saw our whole generation seeking for something familiar amidst the cold and aggressive present. Bottom line - after watching hundreds and hundreds of Hollywood products from the 2000's, Vanilla Sky remains one of the most compelling and brilliant films I am yet to have seen this decade. It's an intense and intriguing story from A to Z, which really only makes you understand it completely towards the final quarter of the film, when it shifts into yet another genre - Science Fiction. P.S. Watch out for one of the most bizarre uses of a Beach Boys song toward the end of the movie, when all things truly go berserk.

Thing is, if you lack the proper patience, you lack the tools to fully realize the masterpiece that director Cameron Crowe has created for us here. Vanilla Sky chronicles the strange events that occur to one David Aames (portrayed accurately by the ever so talented Tom Cruise), a 33 year-old New York playboy, who's lavish lifestyle and reckless behavior is about to take a sudden and extremely violent twist. Aames is the sole inheritor of a publishing company and a real lady's man. After encountering the beautiful Sofia at a party (Penelope Cruz, who also became Cruise's real-life partner for a while at the time this movie hit theaters), David seemingly has a reason to finally settle down and let go of his hectic manners. Unfortunately, that's exactly when reality comes around in the shape of Julie, a hurt and neglected ex-lover who's determined to settle the score with him once and for all &#150; thus denying him the chance of love and happiness he took away from her so abruptly. The jaded lover (Cameron Diaz, in an eccentric and unconventional role) takes David on a highway to hell, driving them both into a tragic car accident. When David wakes up, his face is deformed, his ownership of the company is at risk, and he's haunted by whatever has happened to Julie. Our hero has to grow up and adjust to the harsh reality quickly, or else he'll lose what little he has left. However, adapting to the new status isn't as easy as it may seem. Something has changed in his post-accident life, and he can't quite put his finger on it. Whatever it is, it all comes down to the choices he made after the accident, those turns of fate that now come back to haunt him, thrusting his life into a nightmarish reality &#150; if, indeed, you can call his existence a reality&#133;Throughout the film, Tom Cruise plays the tormented David with such accuracy, you really believe he's going through all these highly surreal events. In the end, without spoiling the film entirely, it's all about the way we handle the choices we make in life, and our never ending pursuit after the things we want the most. It's that bittersweet feeling you can always open your eyes and take the other path in life, that also made me return to this film and watch it over and over again throughout the course of the 5.5 years that went by since I first watched it in theaters. In time, I found many comparisons between the film and the general feel of this decade &#150; which Vanilla Sky captures best. When Cruise's David loses his looks and becomes old real fast, it's the filmmaker foreshadowing our need, as a society, to wake up and face our problems instead of running away from them. The mixture of genres also blends well into this theory, as none of us really know how to approach the historical shifts all around us. When David runs through the empty streets and passes the abandoned Times Square, I saw our whole generation seeking for something familiar amidst the cold and aggressive present. Bottom line - after watching hundreds and hundreds of Hollywood products from the 2000's, Vanilla Sky remains one of the most compelling and brilliant films I am yet to have seen this decade. It's an intense and intriguing story from A to Z, which really only makes you understand it completely towards the final quarter of the film, when it shifts into yet another genre - Science Fiction. P.S. Watch out for one of the most bizarre uses of a Beach Boys song toward the end of the movie, when all things truly go berserk.

But who wasn't overwhelmed when Bond leaped off that dam? I sure was - it felt like one of those Sky adverts we get in cinemas nowadays. But despite the fact this film was a financial success, it is far from perfect. The script isn't great - certain scenes feel more important than the plot as a whole, and though the tank chase through the Russian city was good, it had no real use in the plot. Even though the film has a nice dark side and it is improved by a shocking revelation and betrayal, the plot is ultimately derived and the Goldeneye isn't exactly a very original idea. And the quality of the outer space shots of Earth wasn't hot. The film's most beautiful lady, Xenia Onatopp, was an interesting character but not a complex one - merely eye candy and nothing else. I may be an avid hater of romance in any form, but Elektra King's seductive torture of Bond in The World Is Not Enough was far more effective than Onatopp's constant grunting and groaning in dark settings. It makes for a laugh, but also a pointless femme fatale character. And the villains aren't great either. I hardly even knew who Colonel Ourumov was, and Boris must be one of the least menacing villains either - he defines the word geek in every way. His death may be interesting and his character is somewhat amusing, but he is no Bond villain. This film managed to bring Bond out of the Cold War well and proved that the ending of this long, hard conflict didn't mean the end for 007 - the action scenes are great and won't be feeling dated for years now. Bits of paper flying through the air in the indoor battle before the tank chase show great attention to detail which all films should strive for. And the stunts are also good. Abandoning cr*p CG for great real action is what makes the Bond films great - and Goldeneye is no exception. But it comes with its problems as well. 7\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"20 January 2007","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Goldeneye was a better Bond outing - the opening scenes of the film certainly deliver on the epic scale and action, even if the dialogue between Alec and Bond was dull at best and cr*p at worst.

I still haven't seen the original, and when I recently went into this 2001 version, I expected a rather superficial romantic comedy about a girl who changes boyfriends every month. Unsuspectedly, I got much more out of it (even on a personal level). The movie begins fairly light-hearted, but near the end you'll have to endure some pretty heavy-weight drama. The good thing is None of it all ever becomes cheap. But if you're an emotional human being, it's almost a 100% sure that at one point or another you will feel the urge to shed a tear. Although the ending itself is the most obvious part that will cause viewers to swallow or make their eyes go all watery, my moment of feebleness was when Keanu Reeves brought back the little puppy to Charlize Thereon as a surprise gift.I'd describe this film as a moving romantic drama with touches of comedy. The screenplay itself is like a softly rippling stream that takes you on a gentle ride. And it never changes its ways... No storm will take you by surprise... No whirlpool will suddenly drag you down... But slowly, dark and ominous clouds will darken the sky above you. So, indeed, Nelson Moss inevitably discovers the real reason why Sara Deever wanted him to be her November boyfriend. My idea is that most people will see this coming from miles away (for one thing because of several subtle hints, both in the screenplay and visuals, are being given). And I also believe that the movie intended it that way. But what probably wasn't the intention, was me figuring out at the 36 minutes mark exactly what was wrong with Sara Deever, even down to the exact nature of her condition. It was in the scene where Sara was making eggs for breakfast, after their first night together, it suddenly hit me. So, that was sort of a little bummer there, me knowing it from then on. Instead of fully enjoying all the romantic stuff between them, and witnessing how they grew towards each other, a part of me was constantly waiting for the 'signs' to reveal themselves.Still, it didn't spoil too much. However, there was one big 'party-pooper'-scene. I won't go into it, but... how the hell did Nelson manage to walk out of a hospital unseen, carrying a terminally ill patient (who was on a heart-monitoring machine) in his arms without one single person of the medical staff noticing him? It was the one and only moment that I 'went out of the movie' and just shook my head going Yeah, right.... But gladly, I quickly got over it and enjoyed the rest of the movie. The ending is just damn good. Even though some part of me didn't want it to end that way, it still was the only way I wanted it to end. And I'm aware that saying this might make me sound like as if I'm a barrel full of contradictions, but just see the movie and you'll understand it.I have absolutely nothing bad to say about the performances of the whole cast. Charlize Theron especially shone in this one and even Keanu Reeves was enjoyable in every way (from the go-getter he was in the beginning of the movie to the likable and caring person he became at the end). As far as the comedy aspects go in SWEET November, that scene where he explained his new hot dog campaign during the meeting was simply hilarious. I even re-watched that one scene the next day and was grinning all the way through it.So yep, I think this is a very good movie and it sure was a pleasant surprise for me. I'd probably be rating it even higher if it wasn't for those one or two little fun-spoilers I mentioned earlier... Hmmm... and maybe I also missed one truly hot and steamy sex-scene between Keanu and Charlize there. But still, SWEET November is a movie for all to enjoy, except maybe for those of you who have this way too cynical look on life and love. To them I can only say Lighten up, you're deteriorating the quality of your life and the lives of people close to you.Have a nice day!*** Thanx to this special person (who wanders around on this site often) for recommending this movie to me.

It was the one and only moment that I 'went out of the movie' and just shook my head going Yeah, right.... But gladly, I quickly got over it and enjoyed the rest of the movie. The ending is just damn good. Even though some part of me didn't want it to end that way, it still was the only way I wanted it to end. And I'm aware that saying this might make me sound like as if I'm a barrel full of contradictions, but just see the movie and you'll understand it.I have absolutely nothing bad to say about the performances of the whole cast. Charlize Theron especially shone in this one and even Keanu Reeves was enjoyable in every way (from the go-getter he was in the beginning of the movie to the likable and caring person he became at the end). As far as the comedy aspects go in SWEET November, that scene where he explained his new hot dog campaign during the meeting was simply hilarious. I even re-watched that one scene the next day and was grinning all the way through it.So yep, I think this is a very good movie and it sure was a pleasant surprise for me. I'd probably be rating it even higher if it wasn't for those one or two little fun-spoilers I mentioned earlier... Hmmm... and maybe I also missed one truly hot and steamy sex-scene between Keanu and Charlize there. But still, SWEET November is a movie for all to enjoy, except maybe for those of you who have this way too cynical look on life and love. To them I can only say Lighten up, you're deteriorating the quality of your life and the lives of people close to you.Have a nice day!*** Thanx to this special person (who wanders around on this site often) for recommending this movie to me.

I still haven't seen the original, and when I recently went into this 2001 version, I expected a rather superficial romantic comedy about a girl who changes boyfriends every month. Unsuspectedly, I got much more out of it (even on a personal level). The movie begins fairly light-hearted, but near the end you'll have to endure some pretty heavy-weight drama. The good thing is None of it all ever becomes cheap. But if you're an emotional human being, it's almost a 100% sure that at one point or another you will feel the urge to shed a tear. Although the ending itself is the most obvious part that will cause viewers to swallow or make their eyes go all watery, my moment of feebleness was when Keanu Reeves brought back the little puppy to Charlize Thereon as a surprise gift.I'd describe this film as a moving romantic drama with touches of comedy. The screenplay itself is like a softly rippling stream that takes you on a gentle ride. And it never changes its ways... No storm will take you by surprise... No whirlpool will suddenly drag you down... But slowly, dark and ominous clouds will darken the sky above you. So, indeed, Nelson Moss inevitably discovers the real reason why Sara Deever wanted him to be her November boyfriend. My idea is that most people will see this coming from miles away (for one thing because of several subtle hints, both in the screenplay and visuals, are being given). And I also believe that the movie intended it that way. But what probably wasn't the intention, was me figuring out at the 36 minutes mark exactly what was wrong with Sara Deever, even down to the exact nature of her condition. It was in the scene where Sara was making eggs for breakfast, after their first night together, it suddenly hit me. So, that was sort of a little bummer there, me knowing it from then on. Instead of fully enjoying all the romantic stuff between them, and witnessing how they grew towards each other, a part of me was constantly waiting for the 'signs' to reveal themselves.Still, it didn't spoil too much. However, there was one big 'party-pooper'-scene. I won't go into it, but... how the hell did Nelson manage to walk out of a hospital unseen, carrying a terminally ill patient (who was on a heart-monitoring machine) in his arms without one single person of the medical staff noticing him?

Still, it's hard to see the good guy, the little guy, beaten up by the big guys. Here's one story where Goliath beats David. Anyway, this was an interesting supposedly- true-life story of how Preston Tucker got a raw deal form the Big Three car-makers of the day, and by the government after he built a much better automobile in 1948. The film details how the big boys made sure Tucker's company never sold any of those cars.As mentioned, it's maddening to watch at times, to hear lies and false charges brought against a man who had the right ideas about car safety and engineering and was way ahead of his time.The 1940s atmosphere in this film is very good and the old music is fun to hear, too. The cinematography is great, too, with some tinted vintage-type color at times. It looks wonderful on DVD.The car is super to look at and admire. Jeff Bridges does a solid job of portraying Tucker, an upbeat, positive-thinking inventor. It also was refreshing to see a nice, supportive family, too.

David Lean is the past, long live Minghella. Or something like that. Or not. The movie's strong point is that it remains interesting in spite of its length, even though there are some moments of tedium around the middle. The fact that the movie isn't too dull makes up for its weaknesses.The movie's weakest point is the casting of the doomed lovers. Scott Thomas and Fiennes have no chemistry going. He is as cold and distant as ever; he can't help it - that aloof English exterior is his trademark, whether he likes it or not. But the bigger problem is Thomas. She is far too unattractive to play the part, and when she takes her clothes off we are shocked to see that her body is in even worse shape than her face. She is a mess. A movie of such ambition and scope HAS to have a stunningly beautiful, charismatic leading lady, and a passionate, charismatic leading man. Just picture this movie with Gable and de Havilland. Or, since it's a 90s movie and the choice for such a film is slim, how about McGregor and Collette. Or Pitt and&#133; Oh, hell, almost ANY actress is better-looking than Thomas! I'll never understand why Minghella chose to show Thomas entirely nude, while we get only brief glimpses of the far better-looking (which isn't saying much), better built Binoche. The worst thing about it all is that Thomas is sold to the viewer as some kind of beauty. Well, you have to be gay, mad or blind to buy into that.The story is well-constructed, but contains an incredibly stupid plot-device the allies arresting Fiennes - who has a British accent - just because his name is unusual is very dumb and unconvincing, indeed. It wouldn't matter so much were it not crucial to the tragic outcome. Minghella had to think of a way why Fiennes would betray his country in order to save his girl, but he couldn't think of anything good so he came up with this nonsense. I also think that he overdid it with the predictable tragedies; it is okay to have one suicide in a movie, but two?? One guy kills himself after finding out about Fiennes's betrayal. The other guy, Firth, dives like a kamikaze pilot into Fiennes. It's all just a bit much. The same can be said of the surprising vertical-sex scene; I am used to Michael Douglas screwing his female co-stars on the wall or furniture, but to have non-horizontal sex of this kind in a wanna-be Lean movie is too much.I don't understand why Thomas attacks Fiennes when she appears in his suite just before they bonk for the first(?) time. And I was not at all impressed by that scene where the Indian entertains Binoche with some rope-fresco-spotting nonsense that kind of pretentious stuff is right out of one of those dull arty European movies.
