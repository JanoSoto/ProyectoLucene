I always like it when a writer(s) thinks everything through far enough to make three movies.  Scream 3, however, was a huge disappointment.  It certainly didn't deserve the 35 million it grossed last weekend; the movie is a prime example of the return client idea.  None of the genres you'd think this movie would be a member of really fit.  Instead of the Suspense, Thriller, or Horror genres, it became more of a who-done-it mystery than a boo-ahh crowd pleaser.\tHorror movies (which this is supposed to be) more than any other require a certain amount of willing suspension of disbelief.  The idea is that as a viewer, you know what is happening on the screen wouldn't or couldn't happen in real life, but it's on the screen so you cut a little slack and keep watching.  There is a point where something becomes just so unbelievable that nobody could cut enough slack to momentarily believe what is happening.  Wes Craven and company stepped about 5 feet across this line.  There were some clever ties to the other movies, particularly the first.  You have to really look for some of the references - almost to the point where I wonder if it was done on purpose or if I'm just reaching for a trilogy tie.  The character Randy from the previous films has a short-lived but vital appearance that I really liked, and there was this hilarious part when the killer (garbed in the traditional Stab outfit) throws a knife at Dewey, played by David Arquette.  Overall I'd have to say the acting was below par, but I don't think anyone was in the delusion that Scream 3 was up for the Oscars.   The audience jumped maybe 2 or 3 times, and laughed half a dozen.  I don't think anyone was really on the edge of their seat.  The story did tie up some loose ends, and brought a little closure for the trilogy.  I said this movie was a disappointment, but it wasn't horrible. It just had something to live up to and didn't meet the standards.  Scream 3 was better than the second, but doesn't hold a candle to the original.

The end is kind of sad but the tone of the whole movie is uplifting. The first time I finished this movie, I had no idea that 3 hours had passed. In my opinion, the length is needed to develop the complex plot and the character. I am especially impressed with Brad Pitt's performance. When he first appeared as death, he was quite stiff in his movement, expression, and conversation. In the end during William Parrish's confrontation with Drew, he was quite sophisticated and humorous.This movie is simply beautiful to watch. The cinematography is wonderful.

Here was a film that rejuvenated the genre.  It was directed by horror master Wes Craven and it was written by a guy that obviously grew up liking the same films that we did as youngsters.  Kevin Williamson wrote a brilliant screenplay that showed us how much he loved horror films, and not just by writing a scary film but by including all of the horror insider stuff that only true horror fans would know about.  He threw in a line right from Halloween at the beginning of Scream.  He gave one of his characters the same last name as the doctor in Halloween and a character in Psycho.  He knew of the non harmonious split between Craven and Robert Shaye after the original Nightmare On Elm Street was turned into a comedy for its sequels.  He was smart enough to trick his audience into falling for the question that asks who is the killer in Friday the 13th.  We all think it is Jason but of course he doesn't come around until the sequel, in the first one it was Mrs. Voorhees.  He had Fred Krueger references in the film, he had brilliant and witty dialogue about the horror movie rules for survival and he even had subtle moments of genius when he wrote lines like  you're starting to sound like a Wes Carpenter film.  and  what's the werewolf movie with E.T.'s mom in it?   Kevin Williamson cares about Scream and he cares about horror films.  That is evident in the awesome Scream and even the quite good Scream 2.  But Scream 3 is terrible.  I won't go so far as to say it is an abomination but it is pretty bad.  It alienates its core audience, maybe not the teens that love it for all that it is but the audience of 20 and 30 somethings that know the roots of Scream.  This is not really a true sequel to Scream, it is nothing but a cheap standard horror film that a 90's audience has gotten used to.  There were no real scares, there was no great movie references to it that we could all feel proud that we understood and there was no great ending to sum it up.  Straight up, this film is quite a disappointment, and that is too bad considering who is involved and who they got to take over for Kevin.Ehren Krueger penned this copy of Scream and when I learned that this guy was doing it I was excited.  He wrote one of the best films to come out of 1999 with Arlington Road.  It was smart and frenzied so I had high hopes for his version of Scream 3.  But it was a letdown.  And it goes to show you that no matter how good a writer you are, it is not necessarily easy to take over in a series that already has a certain style of writing.  If this was the first in a series of films, it might not be that bad, but it is the final showing in the great and epic series that had a generation of people scared and another generation of horror geeks ( like myself ) excited that someone had written almost a tribute to us, the horror generation from the late 70's and early 80's.  Ehren Krueger, although he has a great horror last name, is just a cheap and blasphemous copy of the original writer.The film itself suffers from lack of logic.  The killer should have been someone that we know and by giving us a brand new character that somehow ties into to our familiar family of characters really jeapordizes the credibility of the film.  Maybe this is just me but I think a great way to sum up the film would have been to either bring Stu and\/or Billy back somehow and\/or to have maybe Duey be one of the killers as well.  That would have been good and it would have also explained Duey's behavior in the first one and why he never got killed in the films.  Now I know that is just my opinion but it needed more shock than what it had in the film.  It was a terribly unsatisfactory ending and with the film being just okay up until that point, it left me with a terrible taste in my mouth.  It's too bad really because this was such a good series.  They say this is the last one, well they said that about the Friday the 13th series in 1984.  But just a year later Paramount realized that they could still make money off the name and they made another and another and another and.... well you get the point.  I just don't think this is the last of them.  The very last shot left way too much to be interpreted.  I do think there will be a fourth.  Maybe it will be better than this one is.  Then again, any film may be better than this was.It always seems that horror sequels, and maybe just sequels in general don't know when to quit.  Halloween, Friday the 13th, First Blood, Rocky and so on, they all suffer at one point or another from bad sequelitis.

There were no real scares, there was no great movie references to it that we could all feel proud that we understood and there was no great ending to sum it up.  Straight up, this film is quite a disappointment, and that is too bad considering who is involved and who they got to take over for Kevin.Ehren Krueger penned this copy of Scream and when I learned that this guy was doing it I was excited.  He wrote one of the best films to come out of 1999 with Arlington Road.  It was smart and frenzied so I had high hopes for his version of Scream 3.  But it was a letdown.  And it goes to show you that no matter how good a writer you are, it is not necessarily easy to take over in a series that already has a certain style of writing.  If this was the first in a series of films, it might not be that bad, but it is the final showing in the great and epic series that had a generation of people scared and another generation of horror geeks ( like myself ) excited that someone had written almost a tribute to us, the horror generation from the late 70's and early 80's.  Ehren Krueger, although he has a great horror last name, is just a cheap and blasphemous copy of the original writer.The film itself suffers from lack of logic.  The killer should have been someone that we know and by giving us a brand new character that somehow ties into to our familiar family of characters really jeapordizes the credibility of the film.  Maybe this is just me but I think a great way to sum up the film would have been to either bring Stu and\/or Billy back somehow and\/or to have maybe Duey be one of the killers as well.  That would have been good and it would have also explained Duey's behavior in the first one and why he never got killed in the films.  Now I know that is just my opinion but it needed more shock than what it had in the film.  It was a terribly unsatisfactory ending and with the film being just okay up until that point, it left me with a terrible taste in my mouth.  It's too bad really because this was such a good series.  They say this is the last one, well they said that about the Friday the 13th series in 1984.  But just a year later Paramount realized that they could still make money off the name and they made another and another and another and.... well you get the point.  I just don't think this is the last of them.  The very last shot left way too much to be interpreted.  I do think there will be a fourth.  Maybe it will be better than this one is.  Then again, any film may be better than this was.It always seems that horror sequels, and maybe just sequels in general don't know when to quit.  Halloween, Friday the 13th, First Blood, Rocky and so on, they all suffer at one point or another from bad sequelitis.  Now you can add Scream to that unfortunate list.  5 out of 10 ","genre":"Horror, Mystery"},{"date":"9 February 2000","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" I had read some of the poor reviews for this film prior to watching it so I knew what to expect.  This film has a really good (though far from original) plot involving two astronauts whose bodies are taken over while on a space mission.  The aliens (occupying the bodies of the astronauts) return to earth and proceed to impregnate their wives with alien sperm. The women both become pregnant with twins, who are expected to become pilots for an alien designed spacecraft (This was all only vaguely explained in the movie).  The wives, of course, do not know this initially.  The movie is really quite similar in many ways to Rosemary's baby in that the alien occupied astronauts are protective of their host wives who were chosen to have their offspring.  It also takes place in New York to add to the similarities.  The real problem with this movie is that the the sense of menace is not sufficiently built up in the three quarters of the movie.  When Johnny Depp returns from space, he does not seem any different then when he left. Towards the end of the film, he finally starts showing his colors, but there should have been some signs early on.  It is almost as if the Director forgot to tell Mr. Depp that he was supposed to be an alien, and then noticed the problem after it was too late. In summary,  I could not recommend this film, even as a video rental.  It lacks an adequate build up in suspense, and the rational behind the aliens motives was not fully explained in the film.

Goldfinger may be the movie which made Bond a social phenomenon, but it was Thunderball that gave it real legs and assured Jimbo would outlive his '60s milieu.I can't give the picture more than a 7, however. On its own merits, apart from what it did for Bond, Thunderball not a great movie, or even an especially good one. The opening half-hour, as many have said, is very confusing and not a little dull. There are logic holes throughout, none fatal but increasingly annoying with later viewings. The underwater sequences are overlong and not particularly interesting to watch despite the wonderful score and the beautiful underwater scenery. I like Adolfo Celi as the lead villain, and Luciana Paluzzi was as good as bad Bond girls ever got, but I never felt Bond was truly menaced in this one, apart from the great Junkeroo sequence, which is really the highlight of the entire film.Yet I still find myself watching this film and enjoying it again and again. Yes those questions still pop up, like How come Largo has about a dozen henchmen swimming with him and the bombs, yet we see 007 kill more than 20 of them? And If Bond really attached himself to a floating line that was suddenly scooped up by a B-17, wouldn't it rip his torso in two?

For example in Jurassic Park sure, you saw dinosaurs right away, but not the raptors or the T-Rex, they were given a frightful build up that slowly made your heart race with anticipation. Once you had seen a full screen shot of Godzilla it was like the cat was out of the bag. As you watch you know what is going to happen at every turn, nothing was unexpected. It was worth the price of the video rental, but at the box office you got ripped off. I felt like I was. The end threatens a sequel, so be weary and wait for the video.

The answer is no, because you only have to observe the characters faces during sex to understand this....Cronenberg has portrayed sex as a meaningless, everyday act by which brings no satisfaction. This is also the reason why both Ballard and Catherine are trying out other people, in hope that something can come of a poor sexlife.Do the character's become perverts? No again, it is sexual frustration that forces them to explore other sexual acts, a perfect scenario for the director who brought the first properly edited exploding head, mutated Jeff Goldblum into a Fly, had parasitic humans turn the world into an apocalypse and make James Wood stick a gun into a vaginal wound in his stomach! ..but what these new cravings become merely is an eye-opener, nothing they do truly satisfies them.

To me the characters seem meaningless and insignificant in there existence of life, yet they are the foundations of society once you get past everything that is fun and happy, and that is what makes Crash so dark and disturbing, how far will people go for the things they crave so much!Crash is a deeply harrowing film, agreed not for the many, but to purely deem Crash 'rubbish' or 'porno' is ridiculous and without thought.
