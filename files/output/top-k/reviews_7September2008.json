As much as I love fantasy, this franchise is unoriginal and rivals the theft that is Eragon.The acting in this film is the worst of the decade by far. Jeremy Irons is in his thousandth role as a villain, with a hoarse and over the top voice performance. The secondary characters, like the purple guy and various market people are unbelievable and horribly portrayed -- trying too hard to resemble the bar scene in Star Wars. Marlon Wayans is a complete misfire in casting, as well as the main character guy, whose name escapes me. The girl that plays the queen or princess can deliver the lines verbally, but has no idea what body language is and how to move her lips when she's talking; she's stiff as a board.The special effects are terrible, rivaling the highest budget Sci-Fi Channel Original Movie. The dragon at the beginning is so phony looking, how people could continue on believing in this garbage is beyond me. The maze and portals are ridiculous, and there's about 10 minutes of film where we get sweeping shots of tall buildings as a segue into the next scene. Just all a redundant mess this is. The final battle with all the dragons can be summed up in one word LAME.The screenplay is hogwash. Awful dialogue and terrible action scenes. The directing by Courtney Solomon (a dude, if you can believe it) is just as wretched, and I can only hope we don't see more of his work in the years to come.As far as music goes, this is a train wreck. Not one concise theme to drive the film. Just one huge mess. Avoid this at all costs when presented with the task.All in all, there's no way in Heaven or Hell that I could recommend this to anyone.

Christopher Reeve stars as the 'Man of Steel' who, as an infant, is sent to earth by his father in order to escape the imminent peril of his homeworld. From his adoptive home Superman eventually grows into his destiny as a champion of justice and must match wits with self-proclaimed criminal mastermind Lex Luthor (Gene Hackman).One of the reasons why this film is better than the usual superhero fare is the acting. Brando may have been in it solely for the money but he didn't just phone in his performance by any means. Gene Hackman, the other major star at the time, gives a fine performance that hits the perfect tone for the character; equal parts vanity, insanity & camp, without overdoing either. Christopher Reeve is excellent in the challenging dual role of Clark Kent\/Superman. As Kent you believe him as a meek, awkward reporter and as Superman you (as the tagline says) 'believe a man can fly'. The other performances are solid as well, particularly Margot Kidder's charming turn as Superman's love interest Lois Lane.The script is good but every once in a while it descends into cornball territory. For the most part, though, the story has a successful balance of seriousness and lightheartedness. Also, it should be obvious that the more fantastic elements of the story will require considerable suspension of disbelief.Donner's direction is well done and treats the story and characters with a dignity that elevates them above the level of camp. The film's special effects were ambitious but today look unconvincing in a number of scenes. For me, this is the main detraction from the film since the believability of the visual effects is central to the story. On the other hand, one of the major benefits to the film is the score by John Williams, which is among his most memorable in a career that has spawned several immortal movie themes.All in all, this film is worth watching for fans of a wide variety of genres; science fiction, fantasy, adventure, action, etc... This is one of those films that literally has something for everyone. However, you're going to have to accept the fact that the Academy Award-winning special effects of thirty years ago can't hold a candle to today's best efforts.

I think it's fair to say that Fun and Fancy Free is exactly what it says on the tin. It opens with a lively chorus singing the title song and I love how when the animations begins to start up the song follows onto Jiminy Cricket (voiced by Cliff Edwards, died 1971, (I think) at 76) singing his own verses, a laid-back, cheerful happy fellow riding on a large leaf in what soon appears to be a vase. In order to cheer up a sad doll missing her mama and a moody teddy Jiminy puts on a vinyl record telling a story... BONGO The expressive, vivacious and energetic enthusiasm of narrator Dinah Shore is just unbelievable! Bongo, a former circus bear who had been mistreated by the ring-master, longs to be free and eventually gets his dream! He is befriended by all the forest animals and also falls in love - but will things go smoothly? Give you a clue; Every deer and every dove has a way of making love but a bear likes to say it with a SLAPMICKEY AND THE BEANSTALK Jiminy finds an invitation to a party across the way and here's who was there; Luana Patten (died 1996, just 57) the hilariously cheeky Charlie McCarthy, the dazed and absent-minded Mortimer Snerd and the man who threw the party Edgar Bergen (died 1978, 75). Edgar Bergen tries to tell a story (in spite of his frustration at Charlie's frequent interruptions and criticisms) of Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck and Goofy living in poverty leaving Mickey and Goofy miserable and Donald having some violent fits of psychotic rage. Bergen defends him to the end. What about the others? Mickey and Goofy went through it too and they didn't try to murder the family cow! The only way to bring happiness to their home is to fetch an enchanted harp from the castle of a selfish giant but it's an not easy mission because if you can fool Willie the giant you can fool anyone! Can they do it? Mortimer becomes upset at when finally became of the giant and as Edgar tries to comfort him the roof is suddenly torn off by... the giant. Not to eat them but to just pop in. This cartoon musical extravaganza truly did make history in animation; that eye-popping blend of art and live action has been done practically throughout the entire movie. And there's neither bad language nor sex scenes nor violence - just full of Fun and Fancy Free!

It opens with a lively chorus singing the title song and I love how when the animations begins to start up the song follows onto Jiminy Cricket (voiced by Cliff Edwards, died 1971, (I think) at 76) singing his own verses, a laid-back, cheerful happy fellow riding on a large leaf in what soon appears to be a vase.

Unfortunately, as commentator 'Bob The Moo' has mentioned, clichés begin erupting faster than the lava bombs. We really do get the lot. Stressed-out single parent dad, authority figures who look the other way, authority figures who pull rank and try to shout each other down, experts who get ignored, predictably crass acts of heroism, 'buddy' issues, trapped pet issues; trust me, you've seen 'em all, just never all in one movie. The action ebbs and flows like the magma, and is propped-up at flagging moments by silly little insertions of drama.

A fallen and burning palm has cut off their escape. Instead of simply turning a hose-pipe on the trunk and wetting a few feet so they can just hop over, the fire-truck ladder has to be swung round and lowered so they can grab onto it and dangle over the advancing lava - like you do. Unfortunately, the ladder is made out of chocolate or something else so ductile that it melts in the heat and buckles, yet our heroes who are dangling from it suffer no more than scorched shoes.

Even then, it is clear that the movie makers have never seen the inside of an iron foundry. If they had they would know that nobody could stand next to a great pond of white hot magma for more than a few seconds, let alone treat it as little more than a barbie.This is really one of those inferior disaster movies that passed muster in the 1970's but with slightly updated special-effects. In terms of script, acting, directing, and general believability it is about on a par with 'Earthquake'. 'The Towering Inferno', on the other hand, knocks it into a cocked hat.Worth a first watch, but certainly not a second. I found myself muting all of the tiresome, predictable dialogue.

Donald Sutherland and Jaime Lee Curtis pretty much had nothing to do one afternoon, so they set sail on a tugboat with one of the many Baldwin brothers. Also on board are a group of unknown actors playing doomed red-shirt sailors who play dummies that have some dumb comic relief lines and then eventually get croaked.Finding the Mary Celeste-type Russian science vessel was pretty cool, and actually done well. Some of the ghost-like events while the crew tries to salvage the vessel (for millions of dollars, they estimate), not done too bad but much of the material is recognizable from similar ghost ship movies. Most of the acting is up to par, but Sutherland's agent needs to get him a role where he doesn't play a demented nut for once. Here he's a captain trying to make evil deals with the menace, once it's been uncovered what it is.The monster itself is a comedy of contradictions that are really a series of thriller flick clichés woven together loosely and sloppily. There is no consistency in the thing's actions throughout the story.

Modern action flicks tend to be so crammed with special effects and characters capable of super-human feats that 'The Guns Of Navarone' seems pedestrian by comparison. The good news is that although this movie entails a team of 'experts', we can still identify with them all. They're still ordinary, just good at their jobs in a way almost anyone might be.If you can overlook the preposterous crash-landing at the outset and the bombers hanging motionless above the airfield, then the rest is child's play. Gregory Peck is asked to lead a team through treacherous waters, to an equally treacherous cliff. As a mountaineer, his job is to get the rest of the team on top. After that, Anthony Quayle will lead the assault on two lethal guns mounted in a massive and impenetrable bunker on the Greek island of Navarone. It's impossible, of course. It's Alistair MacClean.Action comes thick and fast. From every quarter they're up against it. And they need to get a move on too. A couple of thousand British soldiers will be slaughtered if they fail. That, and a flotilla of destroyers sent to rescue them will be sunk by the guns. Although, as I say, the story moves at a pedestrian pace by modern action movie standards, it is skilfully timed for all that. There are sufficient quiet interludes too, enabling a more detailed character study to be offered. Still; a German E-boat vanishes in moments. A 'tidal' wave wrecks their fishing boat. They lose half their kit and Quayle's character gets a broken leg, leaving Peck to take charge. And of course; there's a traitor in their midst. they are harried by Stukas, and captured by the Gestapo.There's the usual wartime clichés of the period. Germans are as daft as brushes. They are slaughtered without mercy. What is different is that the Germans themselves are generally depicted as less brutal than the British team.There are one or two cheesy bits and plot inconsistencies. For example, Germans are killed by knife despite a silenced handgun providing a much quicker and risk-free solution. There are also one or two subtle, atmospheric moments. Most of the camera-work is excellent, as is the lighting. Darkness actually looks genuine. Sets are believable, with plenty of location work. The cliff looks bogus at times, and there are one or two evidently 'studio' takes in the mountains. Otherwise there is a genuine sense of place. Sound effects are also adequate for its age. A sub-woofer certainly pays dividends.A top-drawer cast of the period includes Gregory Peck, David Niven - uncharacteristically playing a cynic, Anthony Quayle, Anthony Quinn, Stanley Baker & James Robertson-Justice. They lend gravitas to what is otherwise a routine McClean script.The ending includes a reprise of all the characters to a romantic theme which is needless and cheesy, but otherwise this plot is Maclean's second-best actioner, surpassed only by 'Where Eagles Dare'. Even then it's a lot more straightforward and believable.Still highly recommended.

A mute pianist Ada (Holly Hunter) has been arranged to marry Alisdair Stewart (Sam Neill). With her daughter Flora (Anna Paquin) and her piano they travel to New Zealand. Shortly after they arrive, Stewart sells her piano to his neighbor George Baines (Harvey Keitel). Tormented with grief over the loss of her piano, she would do anything to get it back. She soon learns that she can get back from Baines through lessons that have some unpleasant attachments to it. After much gross sexual conduct, he gives it back to her, but inevitably, Ada falls in love with him, which sets them up with emotional and sometimes violent consequences.The Piano is a very well-made film. Director Jane Campion captures every scene with great care. The work of the photography and music is captivating, blending the film into a beautiful, yet creepy artistic value.As with the performances, they are some of the best I've seen. Holly Hunter is very unique in her role. Unlike some other great actresses who rely on bold speeches to give them Oscars, she relies on her face that expresses so many emotions that it's almost heartbreaking to watch due to all the torture and hell her character goes through. Anna Paquin, who I know most for Rogue in the X-Men Trilogy, is young, cute, and adorable as Flora, however, she adds power and a little bit of humor that goes a long way for an actress at her age. Sam Neill and Harvey Keitel also add some diligence to their roles.But the reason why I give this movie a 7 instead of a 10 is because of the subject matter. I felt antagonized by the explicit scenes of gross sexuality and related material. Of course, I have no problem with nudity, but not the sexual fantasies of Harvey Keitel's character.

There's good girl Mariel Hemingway who is auditioning in real life for a part on Candy's soap opera and she shows up in the fantasy as well.

I'll never understand why action movies and horror movies&#151;two genres that are meant to thrill you&#151;always seem to think they have to throw in yet another overdone woman's channel drama, and that is one cliché Scream doesn't break out of, sadly. The drama takes up way too much screen time and dulled the amazing intro and secondary kill scenes. This would have been a near perfect movie if they would have just stuck to the horror.The blood is pretty minimal, and not really even up to the bar set by the older slashers mentioned in the movie. However, some of the kills were more intense than normal slashers.As all of you should already know, the main point to have made Scream is to show that movies were cliché and predictable without turning into one of those movies itself. I think it does that wonderfully, but a little bit more on the subject would have made it more solid, because some people didn't even catch that was the point of the movie.In the end, Scream is just another typical slasher played out on a anti-cliché soapbox.
