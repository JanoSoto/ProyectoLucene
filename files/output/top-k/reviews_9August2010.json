Those movies ore episode are simply over the top. But it is still a movie that is more intense, intelligent and surprising than most of the other so called psycho thrillers and is worth a ten star vote.A little advice You must also watch Lost highway, because this movie is like a twin of this unique masterpiece! Now, let us begin with the bad points, because there aren't very much. This movie is not as twisted, surreal and surprising than Lost highway. That doesn't mean that you might be able to understand it when you have just watched it once, but your not that literally lost as in Lost highway. I also think that this movie copies the structure of Lost highway a lot and is less innovating. There is also a slow paced beginning, then a key event, the looking for the truth beyond dream and reality, the sudden change and the twisted ending connecting the end of the movie with its beginning. With the scenes of the house party in the ending, Lynch gives a lot of possible solutions and keys to the viewer and doesn't let him or her just stunning and without any clue like in his previous work. But if you think by now that this movie is easy to understand than David Lynch gives you such a strange element in the last scene of the movie that makes you desperate and that makes you think that you are back in Eraserhead. But why should Lynch change his style after he had created a true masterpiece a few years ago? We should just see those points as minor critic points. It is not an ten plus extra star masterpiece but just an excellent ten star movie.Now, there is another negative point that I have to mention in a more general way David Lynch wanted to start a new series around Mulholland Drive and this would have been such a great experience as Twin Peaks was or even better and David Lynch put all his creative imagination and dedicated a part of himself to the project - but Americas blockbuster-minded, easy-watching-commercialized Hollywood bosses didn't believe in a success and didn't accord the necessary amounts to one of their genius - the series might not have been popular and a good sell. That's why David Lynch was never able to finish his dream of a new series and we might have never seen parts of his filming if some French investors wouldn't have supported him and convinced him to make at least a movie out of his filming. David Lynch got financial support and an open-minded entourage and that's why he turned some new scenes, worked out a slightly new screenplay and created this new movie. A big thank you to the French supporters and thumps down towards the American film industry which let fall one of their best talents. And maybe all those complicated circumstances are the reason why Lynch made cartoons and worked as a producer in the next years and we had to wait seven years before he came back with the low-budget semi-masterpiece Inland Empire, it's a really sad thing.Now, let's talk about the very positive parts of the movie. It has a little bit less dark atmosphere in the beginning than Lost highway, but there is a key event and some action right after the introduction that make this movie easier to watch - the accident on the Mulholland Drive. But after this happen some really strange scenes that create a really thrilled atmosphere and that make the viewer of that movie think, guess and analyze - the strange old couple, the guy who has strange nightmares, the killer who's doing some stupid mistakes... There are many interesting details in this movie, even more than in Lost highway and the viewer becomes somehow an analyzer or detective. This movie requests multiple viewings and personally, I discover new elements after each viewing and I have seen the movie at least three or four times by now and it wasn't the last time. You really see that Lynch was supposed to do a series with this one because of all the well thought details.Mulholland Drive lives also from the great acting of the two feminine main actors, especially the really charming Naomi Watts who does the job of her life. Every character is unique in this movie even the smaller roles like the nightmare guy and this point is even done better and more intense than in Lost highway. Only the role of the cowboy has a lot of similarities to the role of the mystery man in Lost highway, it is just a pity that he has not much space in this movie.And there is the same advice that I gave for Lost highway expect the unexpected! That may not be as clear in the first three quarters of the movie, it is less disturbing that other works of Lynch, but in the last one, you should better be prepared for some weird stuff that was worth the wait. I agree with critics who say that this movie has a certain Lynchian routine - but his routine is far away from being boring and especially the final thirty minutes should convince you! So, if you want to see a movie that makes work your mind and feelings, a movie you must concentrate on and that may request multiple viewings to understand, you will really appreciate this one. If you're looking for an easy movie for a DVD night with some friends - go for something else, because your party people might get frightened!

It has all the angst and adolescent turmoil of the former and the emotional desolation and individual isolation of the former. Toss in the work of a fine cast and the star power of Jennifer Aniston and you've got yourself a funny, touching movie.Justine Last (Jennifer Aniston) is a 30 year old woman who got married too soon and has found herself trapped in a boring job and to a pot-headed house painter. Stewing in her own misanthropy, Justine is only roused from her self-pity and self-destructive anger by a young man who gets a job at the Retail Rodeo where Justine works. The 22 year old (played by Jake Gyllenhall) calls himself Holden, after the J.D. Salinger character, and refers to the name his parents gave him as his slave name. Those two things tell you pretty much everything there is to know about him. Justine begins an affair with Holden, if you can call sex in a motel after work an affair, and it seems to brighten up Justine's miserable existence. But Justine soon realizes that Holden, for all his overly-sensitive pretensions, is just an angry and unstable boy who has fixated on her as the answer to all his dreams. Then her husband's best friend uncovers her infidelity, touching off a chain of events that forces Justine to choose between the life she thinks she hates and another existence she can't even imagine.I quite liked this film. It's smart and honest and has just a bit of snark, while acknowledging how immature such snark usually is. The Good Girl makes you think about personal unhappiness and the choices and attitudes that create it. The main characters of Justine and Holden are terribly discontented with their lives, yet as the story goes along it makes you understand that probably none of the characters are living the lives of their dreams. The difference is they aren't torturing themselves and everyone else over it. Most movies that focus on the quiet desperation of ordinary life either embrace too completely the idea that normal, unexceptional lives are awful things or they are too viciously judgmental of such common angst. The Good Girl takes a more mature and measured perspective. It validates Justine's unhappiness with the life she chose by marrying the first man she really loved but holds her accountable for not making the best of that life. Her actual problem isn't her circumstances. It's her own lack of ambition or imagination to do anything to improve them.As the story unfolds, you can see that the other characters have found ways to deal with their individually unsatisfying lives. Justine's husband smokes pot to escape. The security guard at the Retail Rodeo has his religious faith. An older co-worker of Justine's has a stoic determination to make the best of things and a disdain for those who don't. A younger co-worker uses snide sarcasm to lash out at a world that doesn't meet her standards. But they all do something, while Justine and Holden just wallow in their anger and resentments.Now, there's a subplot in the story involving the best friend of Justine's husband that's much more over-the-top and overtly self-aware than the rest of the movie. It explicitly details some of the themes that remain under the surface of the rest of the film and you might find it either bracing or off putting. I suppose it depends on your tolerance for a smart script hitting you over the head a few times to make sure you get its point.Jennifer Aniston got a lot of praise when this movie first came out and it was deserved. She's able to convey the subtle nature of Justine's passivity so that you can empathize with the character, even when she's not all that sympathetic. Jake Gyllenhall is also very good with the dual nature of Holden. On the one hand you can see how Justine was attracted to him as a kindred spirit, but on the other hand Gyllenhall always keeps the stunted emotional side of Holden in view of both Justine and the audience. John C. Reilly as Justine's husband does some nice work as well. He takes a character that is supposed to be dumber and shallower than either Justine or Holden and makes him into a person and not a plot device.There have been a lot of independent films made about the ordinary lives or ordinary people. Most of them suck because they're made by filmmakers who either hate such ordinary people or see their lives as nothing more than metaphors to be exploited.

There are about a million things that Besson does to make this movie so one-of-a-kind that you may not notice until the second or third time around. The plot is fantastic in that it continually takes turns towards less desirable paths, which makes the movie all the more intriguing. Rarely does a film successfully walk the tightrope of mildly disturbing without falling into the pit of immorality and pervertedness, but Besson manages to make both Mathilda and Leon likable and peculiar without crossing the line of dementia.Watching this movie the first time through, I cringed at the sight of Mathilda in any type of adult situation, especially sexually. After watching it time after time, her mannerisms began to captivate me, as she is no more a girl than a woman trapped in the body of a twelve year old. Besson is brilliant in his direction of Portman, as Natalie is incredible in her execution of her character. There are countless moments where her words or facial expressions send chills down my spine. The way the camera is placed on Mathilda is so captivating that it is impossible to look away, as much as you feel like you should. This movie almost makes me feel guilty for watching it, but there is nothing else like it; the emotional tensions are so high that it is impossible to resist. Never in my life have I seen such a young star so devoted to her character that it disturbs me; everything about their relationship feels real.The deeper meanings in this movie are also prominent, where love is the major contributor. Not only are there no boundaries to love, but the way Leon acts with Mathilda vs. without her accentuates the fact that without love, he has become nothing, just mere existence. The back-story of his lover and the Russian Roulette scene are key in portraying this theme and Portman performs near perfect to get this point across, which makes the full length version of the film a necessity if not only for those two scenes.This film is not only a film-making masterpiece, but the actors feel so realistic that it's chilling. I have never some across an experience like this before and doubt I will again; this movie is undoubtedly one of the most important love stories I have ever seen, and it makes me think how necessary love is to life.

Rarely does a film successfully walk the tightrope of mildly disturbing without falling into the pit of immorality and pervertedness, but Besson manages to make both Mathilda and Leon likable and peculiar without crossing the line of dementia.Watching this movie the first time through, I cringed at the sight of Mathilda in any type of adult situation, especially sexually. After watching it time after time, her mannerisms began to captivate me, as she is no more a girl than a woman trapped in the body of a twelve year old. Besson is brilliant in his direction of Portman, as Natalie is incredible in her execution of her character. There are countless moments where her words or facial expressions send chills down my spine. The way the camera is placed on Mathilda is so captivating that it is impossible to look away, as much as you feel like you should. This movie almost makes me feel guilty for watching it, but there is nothing else like it; the emotional tensions are so high that it is impossible to resist. Never in my life have I seen such a young star so devoted to her character that it disturbs me; everything about their relationship feels real.The deeper meanings in this movie are also prominent, where love is the major contributor. Not only are there no boundaries to love, but the way Leon acts with Mathilda vs. without her accentuates the fact that without love, he has become nothing, just mere existence. The back-story of his lover and the Russian Roulette scene are key in portraying this theme and Portman performs near perfect to get this point across, which makes the full length version of the film a necessity if not only for those two scenes.This film is not only a film-making masterpiece, but the actors feel so realistic that it's chilling. I have never some across an experience like this before and doubt I will again; this movie is undoubtedly one of the most important love stories I have ever seen, and it makes me think how necessary love is to life.

Everything I've seen with him Im a fan of and I like. Somethings I don't like as much, but Im so into him a Front Row Steve will be made for him in this month. Chasing Amy is the third masterpiece in a row that Kevin Smith did right after the poorly received Mallrats and the acclaimed Clerks. Both movies I enjoy and are on my list of favorites and so is this one. This movie has Clerks style dialogue, a brilliant cast, and an excellent story. Only shot with an advanced 16mm called Super16 than blown up to 35mm, it may not look better than newer films, but sure is way better than a lot of them. A classic Comedy and a fine Romantic love story.Kevin Smith has blown my mind with dialogue. Hes a genius when it comes to large conversations in movies. Wheter dirty or just plain out of the ordinary, he can do it. Give him two or more characters, a setting, and a topic, and he'll turn it into a five minute talk about whatever the hell comes up. Clerks of all his films has the funniest dialogue. To date and since 2006, Clerks has been my favorite movie and Im willing to bet it will stay my favorite forever. One of the first R rated films I watched and whenever I watch it back I pick something up I never caught before. Its a kind of movie I watch it at least two times a year and never get tired of it. Its that kind of movie.Chasing Amy's plot is different from Kevin Smith's previous work it's a serious love story and sort of turns away from the buddies goofing around at the same time stays with it has a romantic story brings into play. Holden and Banky (Affleck and Lee) are two comic book writers whose friendship is effected when Alyssa Jones (Adams) walks into Holden's life and the two develop a close bond. Holden is crushed when Alyssa reveals she is a lesbian, but its not stopping him from still trying to maintain a relationship. But when Holden uncovers secret nicknames and such from Alyssa's past. His relationship is on the rocks. Not only with Alyssa, but his friendship with Banky is also starting to fade as all Holden starts talking and caring about is Alyssa.Not only having a great concept. Chasing Amy does a brilliant keeping in sync with the View Askew storyline. Alyssa Jones is the sister of Heather Jones who walked in the Quick Stop in Clerks when Dante is getting fined. As well as Rick Derris being brought up numerous times who was in the Quick Stop at the same time with Heather. Caitlin Bree from Clerks is mentioned as well by Alyssa when they had an encounter which I wont get into.Some dialogue in the movie, is very interesting and can almost span sometimes for half an hour which is why I like Smith's early work. Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back is referenced by a lot of people as their favorite KS movie. Not mine. Though still appreciating it, I feel that it was too Hollywood and that Vulgar was the last great KS movie. Nowadays I feel he does what he thinks would sell rather than his first movies he did with a rock bottom budget where he was working independently and had more freedom. This movie disappoints in no way and having the DVD be from Criterion Collection adds to the fun of the entire film all around.Starring Ben Affleck, Joey Lauren Adams, Jason Lee, Dwight Ewell, Jason Mewes, Kevin Smith, Brian O'Halloran, and Matt Damon.

It ranks right up there with The Spy Who Loved Me, The Living Daylights, Thunderball, Octopussy. But the strenght in TWINE was that the pre credit sequence had a strong relationship with the main movie.Judi Dench as usual gives her riveting performance as M, sometimes eclipsing even the indomitable Bernard Lee. Here, she was given a more active part as she actually was compelled to go into the active field with Bond. One of the best moves by the Bond producers post Pierce Brosnan was to retain her as M.I hope she still appears in more Bond movies.The surprise here was Sophie Marcue who is the main villain, the first for a woman (that is if you discount the chilling Rosa Klebb of From Russia With Love). The woman is breathlessly beautiful. I could see why Bond would fall in love with her even though he does not hesitate to kill her.Why she has not yet become a major star is what I don't understand.Supporting roles by John Cleese, and the Russian broker(Can't remember his name) were top notch.

In spite of its detractors, who have quite rightly been relegated to the bottom of this enormous pile of contributions, it has come to be regarded by so many as the crowning glory of the Hitchcock oeuvre. As one who would not quite rank it so highly, I could possibly dispute this at length but it hardly seems worth the effort from one whose prime motive for these reviews is to impart enthusiasms rather than dissatisfactions. In any case there is so much that I admire about the film. I only raise my eyebrows with incredulity when a critic such as Michael Wilmington places it on a level with Augelopoulos's Landscape in the Mist (Foreign Affairs pub Mercury House inc.) or Donald Spoto's rating it as one of the four or five most profound and beautiful films the cinema has given us (The Art of Alfred Hitchcock pub. W.H.Allen). For what it's worth, I consider Vertigo a tremendous entertainment, but not quite on the same level as The Birds or The Wrong Man which say so much more about the human condition. My only reason for writing anything that could be considered worthwhile about Vertigo is to mention something that I remember as completely puzzling from several viewings over the years. It is a mystery that on a reshowing this week still doesn't become any clearer. Remember the scene where Scotty (James Stewart) follows Madeleine (Kim Novak) to the McKittrick Hotel. When he asks the receptionist about her he is told that although Madeleine is a frequent visitor she is not there at the moment. When he is taken to the room where he had seen her looking out of a window only a few minutes earlier, she is not there. When he looks out of the window for her car, even that has disappeared. For a director of earthbound plots that never venture into the supernatural this is the only sequence in the whole of Hitchcock that makes no sense. I rushed to Spoto whose excellent analysis of Vertigo would surely offer enlightenment but even he seems at a loss to explain it, implying that the sighting of Madeleine at the window could be a figment of Scotty's imagination. He then rather wriggles out of it by citing another critic as saying it is an example of Hitchcock's knot in the narrative which people may ponder at home after the movie. As I cannot think of any other such knots in Hitchcock films I rather think this could be bunkum. So there it is, an enigma for which there must be some explanation, or am I missing the point?

When he is taken to the room where he had seen her looking out of a window only a few minutes earlier, she is not there. When he looks out of the window for her car, even that has disappeared. For a director of earthbound plots that never venture into the supernatural this is the only sequence in the whole of Hitchcock that makes no sense. I rushed to Spoto whose excellent analysis of Vertigo would surely offer enlightenment but even he seems at a loss to explain it, implying that the sighting of Madeleine at the window could be a figment of Scotty's imagination. He then rather wriggles out of it by citing another critic as saying it is an example of Hitchcock's knot in the narrative which people may ponder at home after the movie.

In spite of its detractors, who have quite rightly been relegated to the bottom of this enormous pile of contributions, it has come to be regarded by so many as the crowning glory of the Hitchcock oeuvre. As one who would not quite rank it so highly, I could possibly dispute this at length but it hardly seems worth the effort from one whose prime motive for these reviews is to impart enthusiasms rather than dissatisfactions. In any case there is so much that I admire about the film. I only raise my eyebrows with incredulity when a critic such as Michael Wilmington places it on a level with Augelopoulos's Landscape in the Mist (Foreign Affairs pub Mercury House inc.) or Donald Spoto's rating it as one of the four or five most profound and beautiful films the cinema has given us (The Art of Alfred Hitchcock pub. W.H.Allen). For what it's worth, I consider Vertigo a tremendous entertainment, but not quite on the same level as The Birds or The Wrong Man which say so much more about the human condition. My only reason for writing anything that could be considered worthwhile about Vertigo is to mention something that I remember as completely puzzling from several viewings over the years.

The first was the temporary backlash against Robin Williams at the time for his performance in the manipulative Patch Adams. The second was the onslaught of reviews that called it schmaltzy and overly-sentimental. Well, I never found it to be that way. If you want to watch a horribly manipulative and sentimental emotional rape then check-out the other Columbus\/Williams movie Mrs. Doubtfire. I'd rather throw myself into the path of an oncoming combine harvester than watch that again.The film opens in 2005 (the near future at the time) as Mr. Martin (Sam Neill), a wealthy businessman has a robot servant delivered to his luxurious home. As soon as the robot is powered up he seems to be...different. His name is Andrew (which means man or manly) and while his body may be robotic, his personality is not. In fact he very slowly develops and learns human characteristics as he interacts and responds to the world around him.Mr. Martin is astonished by Andrew's ability to understand art and music. He treats him like a member of the family and educates him by the fire every night on the customs and history of mankind. As the years pass and lives fade away Andrew sets-off on a decades-long journey to find other robots like him. The quest ends when he meets Rupert Burns (Oliver Platt), a robotics engineer who turns Andrew from a simple robot into a life-like android. Upon returning home with his new appearance he falls in love with his old master's great-granddaughter, who is an exact double of her grandmother. They want to be with each other so badly but know they will never be accepted by society unless Andrew can become fully human. Which is impossible.Or is it? It's a question for the atheists and religious zealots to fight over. At what point does Andrew develop a soul? Why is he different from other robots? Did God give him the gift of human emotion? It is a cosmic selection or is it up to the World Council to declare Andrew human? It all builds to a heartbreaking ending, that is honestly one of the toughest movie endings I have ever had to sit through. I can't even write about it so I'll end my description here.This is familiar territory for Williams though. His performance as Mork learning about Earth and marrying a human woman is rather close to Andrew Martin's journey to become a man. And although I wouldn't call it a kid's film, or even a comedy, there are still a lot of laughs. But not in the usual anarchic Williams style. Andrew's curiosity of the world is a much more refined and quieter performance. It's a shame that most people can't see that it's Williams inside the suit for the first hour of the film as it makes us forget he's there on the screen and perhaps appreciate his acting ability less.James Horner's score is also simply wonderful. It's hard to believe the man who gave us the storming action sound of Commando and Aliens could also be capable of something so warm and beautiful. I guess they didn't give him the award for Titanic for nothing. For this movie he again teamed-up with Celine Dion to record the song Then You Look At Me, which is the perfect tune to roll the credits to. I don't care what you think about me, I love it. Even if the lyrics make that ending even more harrowing.Despite going as far ahead as the year 2205, there's no utopia or dystopia subtext to distract us from the story of Andrew's life. The evolution of technology and architecture is handled subtly and is unobtrusive. It's a quirky irony though, that Andrew's inventions and discoveries help save lives and forward the human race despite not being fully human himself.Bicentennial Man is certainly the most mature and subversive film of Chris Columbus' career as a director.

There is no doubt that the film was an extra-ordinary masterpiece of special effects and philosophical predictions and messages. The aspect of the film im having trouble comprehending is the entertainment value. The slow moving scenes seemed to drag on and on with very little happening. The dialogue was stagnant while the acting wasn't anything extra-ordinary. There were points in the film where i felt bored. Maybe it was because you cannot appreciate fine art by looking at it from a distance. The confusion of the symbolic references and subliminal messages left the viewer trying to comprehend every little detail in the film. Apart from the slow dialogue there was not much else negative about the film. The occasional pointless scene popped up every now and then and the hidden clues left me feeling frustrated at times but the story line and messages the film portrays more than makes up for this. The attention to detail in the film is amazing. The lack of CGI during that time means this film was made by models. This to me is incredible. The graphic quality on the DVD means this film looks by no means outdated. The costumes were excellent. The prediction of the changes in fashion is almost spot on. The language that is spoken is also unique as it is a combination of many different dialects spoken today. Steering away from the graphic and entertainment side of the movie leaves us with meaning of the film. What is the meaning of the film you ask? What is the meaning of existence... So what is the meaning of existence? It is a question that can never be truly answered but this film is a sort of gateway into which the viewer can be taken into and given a reason to think about this question. The film gives very little assistance in this great dilemma but it gives plenty of opportunity to explore this concept through its many sub themes. The creation's triumph over its creator- This was very graphically depicted in the film. As Roy Batty's thumbs penetrated the brain of his creator he effectively eliminated the only thing that had control over him. The reason he killed JS Sebastian in such a brutal way leaves one to question Roy's morals and ethics. If he was truly human, would he have done such a violent act? Maybe thats not such an important fact but it leads to the freedom that Roy had been searching for. Personal Identity- The reason the replicants kill ruthlessly is to find out more about their own identity. The memories they have been given do not adequately fufilll their emotional needs. They have a burning desire to survive and the security of knowing where they come from will aid their mission. So what is life? Blade Runner makes you think about what is the true definition of life. Without a greater being determining what your meaning is, are you not pointless? There is no right or wrong answer but the important thing is that this films saves us from our ignorance and makes our grey matter work. My verdict of the film is... It is a masterpiece.

Basically the film opens once again with the winning kick in the face by Daniel LaRusso (Razzie nominated Ralph Macchio), and the little squabble between bitter trainer John Kreese (Martin Kove) and Mr. Kesuke Miyagi (Razzie nominated Noriyuki 'Pat' Morita) in the second film, before it moves on. Kreese has lost students and business since Daniel won the fight against his student, and he wants to get revenge by pitting a new high class karate student against him. Kreese goes on vacation and gets his Vietnam comrade Terry Silver (Thomas Ian Griffith) to take care of it for him, by getting deadly karate student Mike Barnes (Sean Kanan) ready for the up and coming tournament Daniel won a year earlier. Daniel and Mr. Miyagi meanwhile have returned from Japan, and Daniel helps his old friend achieve his dream of opening his own bonsai tree store. Daniel has met and hanging out with pottery shop across the street from their shop worker Jessica Andrews (Robyn Lively), but is being hounded by Mike, in town demanding he sign the tournament form. Of course this is part of Silver's plan, first to get Daniel in the tournament, and then meet him as a new trainer to make him a ruthless fighter and get away from Mr. Miyagi, maybe even split their friendship. Daniel gives in and signs the form to take part when rock climbing gets in the way, and he agrees to let Silver train him to become much more aggressive than he normally would be, and Mr. Miyagi and Jessica both get this new attitude. Daniel realises his change in attitude, and goes to Silver to stop training with him, and that is when Kreese, who Silver told him was dead, comes up behind him, with Mike, and they all reveal their plan. Mr. Miyagi didn't want him to compete for the glory, but to keep his honour, and of course seeing this thing too gives him the confidence to allow the fight. In the final fight, Mike is told to fight rough, but keep the score even until the point they announce sudden death, Daniel is weak and scared, but Mr. Miyagi gives him the confidence back, and he does win like he should. Also starring Jonathan Avildsen as Snake and Glenn Medeiros. This film is the most despised of the original films, I didn't think it was as bad as they make it sound, obviously the first film is the best, but there were small parts of this martial arts adventure to like, only small.

Avildsen (Rocky). Basically the film opens once again with the winning kick in the face by Daniel LaRusso (Razzie nominated Ralph Macchio), and the little squabble between bitter trainer John Kreese (Martin Kove) and Mr. Kesuke Miyagi (Razzie nominated Noriyuki 'Pat' Morita) in the second film, before it moves on. Kreese has lost students and business since Daniel won the fight against his student, and he wants to get revenge by pitting a new high class karate student against him. Kreese goes on vacation and gets his Vietnam comrade Terry Silver (Thomas Ian Griffith) to take care of it for him, by getting deadly karate student Mike Barnes (Sean Kanan) ready for the up and coming tournament Daniel won a year earlier. Daniel and Mr. Miyagi meanwhile have returned from Japan, and Daniel helps his old friend achieve his dream of opening his own bonsai tree store. Daniel has met and hanging out with pottery shop across the street from their shop worker Jessica Andrews (Robyn Lively), but is being hounded by Mike, in town demanding he sign the tournament form. Of course this is part of Silver's plan, first to get Daniel in the tournament, and then meet him as a new trainer to make him a ruthless fighter and get away from Mr. Miyagi, maybe even split their friendship. Daniel gives in and signs the form to take part when rock climbing gets in the way, and he agrees to let Silver train him to become much more aggressive than he normally would be, and Mr. Miyagi and Jessica both get this new attitude. Daniel realises his change in attitude, and goes to Silver to stop training with him, and that is when Kreese, who Silver told him was dead, comes up behind him, with Mike, and they all reveal their plan.

Unlike his scientifically designed younger brother Anton, Vincent has DNA remarkable only for his high chance of dying young from a bad heart. That unenhanced genetic code is an anchor on Vincent's life. In this new world, they don't judge you by your ambition or even your achievements. All that matters is the biological potential built in to your genes. Without the right DNA, Vincent is lucky to get a job as a janitor. But still he studies and trains and dreams of getting a job at the Gattaca corporation and getting on one of their rocketships and flying into space.Vincent, however, will never be able to do that as long as he remains Vincent. So instead, he has to become Jerome Morrow. Vincent enters a black market world where people assumed the genetic identities of others. Jerome (Jude Law) is a artificially conceived superman who lacked the will and the drive to live up to his physical and intellectual gifts. Then he was crippled and became the perfect match for Vincent. Jerome will provide Vincent with his identity and physical samples of his blood, hair, urine and skin cells, so Vincent can use Jerome's DNA as his passport to Gattaca and the stars. In return, Vincent will support Jerome in the style to which he's become accustomed.It almost works, until a mission controller at Gattaca is murdered. The police investigate and find some of Vincent's inferior DNA, making him the prime suspect. But will they be able to figure out that the Jerome who works at Gattaca and is about to leave Earth for a trip to one of Saturn's moons is really the de-gene-erate named Vincent?This is a visually subdued but very good looking movie. It very much follows the future sensibility of 2001 A Space Odyssey, where the world-to-come is clean and cold and unadorned. Gattaca's look is more corporate than antiseptic, however, and isn't too concerned with trying to realistically represent a possible future. It's more stylized, which I think that makes the imagery of Gattaca striking and memorable in a way most sci-fi films are not.The cast features some fine work by the fairly young Ethan Hawke, Uma Thurman and Jude Law. Thurman, as the woman who falls in love with Vincent, feels trapped by the limitations of her genes. Law is excellent as a man burdened and tortured by the expectations of his own genetic perfection. Hawke takes on the most challenging role and pulls it off almost without flaw. As Vincent playing Jerome, he has to show the audience emotions and thoughts while making us believe no one around Jerome can see them. Ernest Borgnine shines in his few moments on screen and Loren Dean, as the cop investigating Vincent, manages to embody what the audience is suppose to dislike about this future world without ever becoming a two-dimensional pawn of the script.This story takes a very dim view of trying to build better human beings and creates a frighteningly possible future culture of genetic entitlement, but writer\/director Andrew Niccol didn't just make a piece of propaganda. What he did was imagine a world of DNA prejudice that is no different from the petty bigotries that have swayed the minds of Men since the very beginning. He does suggest that a bigotry backed by the most advanced science may be more pernicious and hard to challenge than any other.Gattaca is a wonderful movie that might not click with everyone because it keeps its emotions hidden and restrained. It's very powerful message is more interested in engaging your mind than in tugging on your heartstrings.

It is gone and good riddance. And what if we were confronted to that kind of gangsterism again in our suburban sprawl?

Not spaghetti in the least and not parading à la John Wayne in the even slightest least. Real tough, dirty, hateful. Two lazy and absolutely zilch young men who do not want to do anything, learn anything, even swimming, and yet want the money other people are making so that they both with their common lady love can have high life on the frontier. Just marginal and incompetent young men who do not have any sense of time, of the past and the future, of what was possible before and what is leading to no future, but who cares about the future since we have good money, good food, good wine and good bourbon right now. Tomorrow is another day and we have to spend the night somewhere before we reach that tomorrow. And they don't learn. First they do not see that trains are finished and that train companies are going to set up the real tracking teams they need to capture them, dead if possible. When they finally realize trains are out just like banks are finished, they go to New York and board a boat to Bolivia. And there they discover banks are not paying, local bandits are both more numerous, better organized and tolerated, but also not quite fast enough for two Yankee outlaws. But they also will find out that no one is going to close their eyes and they will report everything. They won't wait or be afraid. Let's tell the local police that is quite plentiful, and they will in their turn call the cavalry and then dying will no longer be an option. It will be the only bottleneck way out, shot by hundred of bullets and not two or three. Beautiful film that tries to give the real smell and feel of the frontier in those days, dirty, smelly, dusty, potent with filth and total lack of courage, but economically enterprising and trusting the best trackers and the best professional shooters to do the job.

If you've ever seen The Room, you will understand. The fight scenes are hilariously bad. Everyone has seen fight scenes that are obviously choreographed. This was worse. Not only were these obviously choreographed, they are extremely badly choreographed. I cracked a different rib laughing during every sword fight. I have no ribs left.The music was probably the most disappointing part of the movie. Every note was completely out of place an had nothing to do with the scene playing. In the final battle scene, they start playing victory music halfway through the fight. Really?? Yes, we have known the entire movie that the main character is going to win. BUT DO YOU HAVE TO INSULT YOUR AUDIENCE!!!!????? It was disgusting.The only redeeming quality is that Highlander is so bad it's funny. It insults its audience at every turn. The lines range from cheesy to ridiculous. Don't see this movie unless you're looking for a cheap laugh at the filmmakers' expense.

A fairly gripping saga, gorgeously photographed and sumptuously produced, with marvelous performances from Malmsjö and Wållgren... but mostly a more artistic gem to admirably behold rather than be moved by and involved in. Considered a masterpiece by many, not by me. Why?Well, I caught the 188 min' version, and many bits - although enjoyable on their own, such as Kulle's monologues and erotic shenanigans - seem to be from completely different films altogether in tone, patched up to a big quilt with unfitting seams, in contrasting the children's ghastly torment of their stepfather (Alexander's head-to-head battles of will with him IS a highlight), with the unrelated, more easy-going content from the family's head estate. The relatives fates from the first act are unresolved and completely detached from the remaining main story Emilie, her failed re-marriage and the children's struggle. They all honestly don't evoke terribly much emotional sympathy because we don't really get to know them; for example, Alexander misses his dead father and hates his stepfather... and that's basically all. And we also really have no other sign of the family's togetherness than their spoken confirmations, which contribute to this film's most disjointed, highly inconsistent feel with quite a few leaps in the storyline. Perhaps the TV-series version is more cohesive?Bergman's love for the theater is of course ubiquitous, both in establishing the family's relation to it, as well as much of the overly theatrical acting\/line delivery, heavily metaphysical & religious symbolism and solemn theme presentation (with a nod to August Strindberg at the end). That style blend is of course a matter of preference, and I'm not a huge fan of it, presented this way (NOTE this is my third Bergman altogether). And one major question truly arises where the hell is Fanny in this movie? A character with her name in the title, has no impact on anything whatsoever in a story spanning 3 hours... how can that be? 6 out of 10 from Ozjeppe ","genre":null},{"date":"9 August 2010","score":"13 out of 22 people found the following review useful","review":" This is Ingmar Bergman's semi-autobiographical Life and Times of wealthy theater family Ekdahl in 1907 Uppsala, mainly told from the eyes of young Alexander as his mother is widowed, remarries a harsh bishop, and moves into his church estate with both the children.
