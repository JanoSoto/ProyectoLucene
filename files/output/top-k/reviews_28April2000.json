This was a career leap that puts Travolta's '94 resurrection in the dust.  Saarsgard and Sexton gave great performances as well and I like the way their characters were portrayed.  I was prejudiced towards them by knowing the outcome of the story and what their actions would eventually be but when I saw them in the film they were actually likeable, IN THE BEGINNING. Saarsgard even made John Lotter seem creepily gentle before revealing his darker side and finally turning into a monster at the end. I have a suspicion that Matthew Shepard's murderers came across like that when he first met them.Parts of the film bothered me though, particularly the trippy scenes like the power lines and the fast-motion shots of the factory and the landscape.  It was too reminiscent of Oliver Stone's Natural Born Killers\/U-Turn phase when the drugs were directing the movies instead of him.  Not that that's a bad thing per se, I just think it was unnecessary and distracting from this film.  The landscape, characters and story could certainly speak for themselves without the technical touch-ups. And I questioned why certain dramatizations were made and others weren't.  From what I've read about the actual story, Teena was murdered in his sleep and Tisdal wasn't present.  That was altered for dramatic purposes, fine.  But the rape occurred during the Christmas season and the murder on New Year's. That was certainly dramatic and wouldn't have required a stretching of the facts.  Other than that, 8 out of 10.
