She is outstanding, as is everyone, especially Chris Cooper, in his portrayal of a ex-military soldier, sure of keeping his eighteen year old son in line.While the film tackles a lot of issues that some might find, offensive or grosse, I find the movie to always be genuinely entertaining and thoughtful. It's an interesting film that will always keep you waiting for the next scene, surprise and line.Annette Benning, rightly nominated for her role as the wife of a man who's gone completely numb from living with her for two decades, is at her very best in this movie. She is so convincing that there are times when it's hard to remember it's only a film that we're viewing. However, this being said, that almost all of the actors in this piece were phenomenal, the one person I think is almost out of place was Thora Birtch. Her role as the daughter of Kevin Spacey and Annette Benning, isn't as convincing as some of the other characters, and quite frankly could have been played better by another actress.Allison Janney was remarkable as the wife of Chris Cooper, and it always disappoints me that she has such a small role in the film. She usually is casted in comedies, and is a hilarious comedianne, however, in this piece she plays an almost mental case, hardly ever talking and when she does it's done brilliantly.The direction is outstanding, and the writing very precise.

He finds an Italian family with four daughters who he sets his sights on, gradually discovering that they have not been as virtuous as they have led on.Firstly there is some good comedy, Draculas' coffin on top of his car is a great image.

Udo Kier is actually not too bad, he looks ill enough for the role and has piercing eyes. There are some hilariously stupid parts, such as the 100 year old waitress in the hotel, the really stupid game that Polanski plays with Dracula's aide, the accents are all over the place and so varied it is like a UN meeting.There are no special effects, apart from the ending with an hilarious dismemberment scene and dual staking. There is also a Marxist undertone from the gardener and general hero Mario, who is so heroic he has sex with the youngest daughter very quickly so that Dracula will not be interested in her! The sporadic nudity keeps the viewer interested throughout, as there are very long pieces of dialogue that go nowhere at all.That's it really, not a very good film, but there are laughs to be had and it gives us all hope to become actors one day.

This is certainly not true of 'Quest for Fire' but the comment from your user, 'Evolvest' from Texas, (It really looks like we are seeing through a window of time 80,000 years ago, in all its beauty and ugliness) seems to say almost all that is necessary in just 20 words. My comments here relate to what we can expect to see when we look through this window. If we are perceptive enough to observe what is shown, but never blatantly displayed, it can be surprisingly rewarding. The first thing we might comment on is the remarkably effective communication achieved, not only between the actors themselves but also between the actors and the moviegoers, simply through body language (thanks here go to Desmond Morris). The next is the clever field work and camera work which mean we are relatively unaware of whether the sequence concerned was filmed in Iceland, Scotland, Canada or Kenya; and regardless of which is shown we accept all these scenarios as one true contiguous wilderness unmarked by civilization. For achieving both this and the credibility of the various scenes in the movie, Annaud deserved some special award - not many directors can have faced comparable problems. Soon after this we begin to appreciate how closely fire and life were linked for the people of this age, without fire they will either be killed in their caves by wild beasts or die of starvation or cold. We think of our well heated dry homes with well stocked larders, and then of what it must really have been like to have lived under the conditions shown. We recognise that these were very early men, but men just like ourselves and just as capable of appreciating and using the benefits of technology. Instead they faced many more centuries of existence before achieving even the primitive level of technological competence required by the earliest civilization.When their source of fire was lost we appreciate the heroism shown by the three tribesmen who undertake to search for a replacement, and on their travels we share with them their immense surprise when they encountered other tribes with slightly different levels of technological development., we note that some of these tribes were friendly but that, even at this early time, others only wanted to hunt, kill, and perhaps eat them. This leads us to ponder on the origin of human aggressiveness and on how it can ever be brought under control. We watch fascinated as their mutual quest alone together brings the three tribesmen closer with mutual bonding which would probably never have taken place if they had stayed in their community. We may even think we can detect the origins of human love as distinct from lust (although this is perhaps a little fanciful). We also see a dawning ability to accept and adapt to the concept of technological change, which is suddenly dramatically enhanced when they discover from a more advanced tribe that fire can be produced artificially. In essence, during the few days hunting for fire we can see the results of many centuries of normal evolution taking place. This is a truly great film because few viewers will watch all this and not develop a better understanding of themselves and their place in the present world.The film wisely leaves open the question of whether the Ulam tribe our heroes belonged to would benefit enough from these traumas to catch up with their more advanced rivals who had already mastered the art of creating fire, or whether they would eventually encounter another crisis that they could not surmount and would become extinct. However all the tribes shown are at similar stages of development, and are genetically compatible. Intermarriage can be a quick way to play catch-up, and the film hints at this when Ika joins our three heroes and is taken back to the Ulam tribe with them.This film is virtually unique, but it reminds me strongly of a book Before Adam written by Jack London which I read in my teens. The theme is very similar - it is in autobiographical form and takes the form of unusually dramatic and vivid dreams experienced and reported by a modern man. In these dreams, which he attributes to some genetic quirk, he becomes 'Big Tooth' one of the primitive 'tree people' whose territory lies quite close to that of a more advanced tribe - the 'fire people'. Big Tooth comes into contact with a female he calls the 'Swift One' who has fled from her own tribe and is afraid to live in any community. They set up a cave home together shortly before the fire people attack his tribe and kill almost all of them. The book ends with the modern man recognising that 'Big Tooth' and his mate must have survived to have offspring that passed on the genetic quirk which eventually resurfaced in him and led to these autobiographical dreams. The point of interest here is that the novel recognises different tribes may all be more advanced in different and specific ways. Big Tooth had no means for creating fire but had trained a dog to help in hunting. Although more advanced in this respect, survival was most closely associated with weapon development, and different tribes had no qualms in wiping out possible rivals to their territories. This must have been essentially how it was for many thousands of years, although probably many of the women survived and contributed genes to the gene pool of the conquerors so advancing the evolutionary process. I would recommend this book to the consideration of any daring and creative film-maker prepared to produce another serious film about prehistoric man.

This is a truly great film because few viewers will watch all this and not develop a better understanding of themselves and their place in the present world.The film wisely leaves open the question of whether the Ulam tribe our heroes belonged to would benefit enough from these traumas to catch up with their more advanced rivals who had already mastered the art of creating fire, or whether they would eventually encounter another crisis that they could not surmount and would become extinct. However all the tribes shown are at similar stages of development, and are genetically compatible. Intermarriage can be a quick way to play catch-up, and the film hints at this when Ika joins our three heroes and is taken back to the Ulam tribe with them.This film is virtually unique, but it reminds me strongly of a book Before Adam written by Jack London which I read in my teens. The theme is very similar - it is in autobiographical form and takes the form of unusually dramatic and vivid dreams experienced and reported by a modern man. In these dreams, which he attributes to some genetic quirk, he becomes 'Big Tooth' one of the primitive 'tree people' whose territory lies quite close to that of a more advanced tribe - the 'fire people'. Big Tooth comes into contact with a female he calls the 'Swift One' who has fled from her own tribe and is afraid to live in any community. They set up a cave home together shortly before the fire people attack his tribe and kill almost all of them. The book ends with the modern man recognising that 'Big Tooth' and his mate must have survived to have offspring that passed on the genetic quirk which eventually resurfaced in him and led to these autobiographical dreams. The point of interest here is that the novel recognises different tribes may all be more advanced in different and specific ways. Big Tooth had no means for creating fire but had trained a dog to help in hunting. Although more advanced in this respect, survival was most closely associated with weapon development, and different tribes had no qualms in wiping out possible rivals to their territories. This must have been essentially how it was for many thousands of years, although probably many of the women survived and contributed genes to the gene pool of the conquerors so advancing the evolutionary process. I would recommend this book to the consideration of any daring and creative film-maker prepared to produce another serious film about prehistoric man.

This is certainly not true of 'Quest for Fire' but the comment from your user, 'Evolvest' from Texas, (It really looks like we are seeing through a window of time 80,000 years ago, in all its beauty and ugliness) seems to say almost all that is necessary in just 20 words. My comments here relate to what we can expect to see when we look through this window. If we are perceptive enough to observe what is shown, but never blatantly displayed, it can be surprisingly rewarding. The first thing we might comment on is the remarkably effective communication achieved, not only between the actors themselves but also between the actors and the moviegoers, simply through body language (thanks here go to Desmond Morris). The next is the clever field work and camera work which mean we are relatively unaware of whether the sequence concerned was filmed in Iceland, Scotland, Canada or Kenya; and regardless of which is shown we accept all these scenarios as one true contiguous wilderness unmarked by civilization. For achieving both this and the credibility of the various scenes in the movie, Annaud deserved some special award - not many directors can have faced comparable problems. Soon after this we begin to appreciate how closely fire and life were linked for the people of this age, without fire they will either be killed in their caves by wild beasts or die of starvation or cold. We think of our well heated dry homes with well stocked larders, and then of what it must really have been like to have lived under the conditions shown. We recognise that these were very early men, but men just like ourselves and just as capable of appreciating and using the benefits of technology. Instead they faced many more centuries of existence before achieving even the primitive level of technological competence required by the earliest civilization.When their source of fire was lost we appreciate the heroism shown by the three tribesmen who undertake to search for a replacement, and on their travels we share with them their immense surprise when they encountered other tribes with slightly different levels of technological development., we note that some of these tribes were friendly but that, even at this early time, others only wanted to hunt, kill, and perhaps eat them. This leads us to ponder on the origin of human aggressiveness and on how it can ever be brought under control. We watch fascinated as their mutual quest alone together brings the three tribesmen closer with mutual bonding which would probably never have taken place if they had stayed in their community. We may even think we can detect the origins of human love as distinct from lust (although this is perhaps a little fanciful). We also see a dawning ability to accept and adapt to the concept of technological change, which is suddenly dramatically enhanced when they discover from a more advanced tribe that fire can be produced artificially.

All the minor characters are played by top drawer British talent, and cannot be faulted.Unfortunately, the production values are a good deal less impressive, with the sets, costumes and make-up looking adequate for a television movie, but falling well short of the standards expected of a major cinematic feature.The biggest problem with Wilde however, is the script. The pacing seems all wrong the trial scenes which ought to have been the centrepiece are just thrown away. The device of using The Selfish Giant as a unifying conceit just doesn't work, and the fans of the story will be disappointed by the omission of the story's conclusion.

It is when all the characters in a movie seem to talk and sound and act alike, like in the old Disney cartoons where Goofy played every single character. Even when it is done well, like in a Robert Altman movie where everyone usually natters in a similar semi-low voiced chatter about trivial things or in a Woody Allen movie where everyone tends to expound with the sophisticated cynical wit of a New Yorker arts review, it can get to be just a little bit annoying. It's not so bad in those films, because it usually underscores the comic intent of the dialogue. However, too often it is used to reinforce a cultural stereotype (southern bigots, poor blacks, middle-class Jews, etc.) even when such a stereotype isn't necessarily real.In JOHNS, a film about street level male prostitutes, everyone speaks with a Hey man, how's it hangin', man? What the f---'s happen, you m.....f....., man? And so on. Well, some of them add a little bit of swishy oh-so homosexual lisp to the pronunciation, but basically it is as though all the hustlers took the same Berlitz course on how to sound like you are savvy to the sounds of the lean streets of Los Angeles. It would seem to me that the story would be better told by stressing just how different these guys are. Instead, the point of the film seems to be that they are awfully alike. Even the man character played by David Arquette is named John and he keeps running into other characters named John, some of whom are his johns.Other than to deny the characters any sort of complexity, it is difficult to see just what the point of JOHNS is. I can't say the film has any great sympathy for the characters, even as it rather smugly traps them all in an atmosphere of impending doom. Resolutely downbeat, JOHNS not-so-subtly makes it clear that someone is going to die by the end of the film and the only suspense springs from trying to guess who. Is it Arquette as the optimistically foolish John or Lukas Haas as his foolishly optimistic friend, Donner? Let's just say that as soon as one of the characters starts talking about scoring one last john before he retires from prostitution forever, he might as well just crawl into a body bag because his fate is sealed.Arquette's John spends Christmas Eve trying to hustle up or steal enough money to pay back $300 he has stolen from a drug dealer and to get quite a bit more so that he can spend Christmas Day, his birthday, in a luxury hotel. The Christmas angle and the suggestion that John is some sort of a Jesus figure hangs uneasily over the story like the pretentious subtext of a bad play. Indeed, the film's theatrical nature never quite jibes with its desire to seem street wise, leaving it all seemingly artificial and empty. And despite the milieu, the film isn't explicit on any level, having no nudity, only implied sex and even the violence is off screen. It is a remarkably timid film about a remarkably lurid subject.As dull wittedly predictable as the film is, it is worth seeing just for the actors. Elliott Gould, John C. McGinley and Arliss Howard have their moments as various customers who pass through, and Haas' geeky charm serves him well as a teen whose been kicked out by his father for announcing that he is gay.

Though he is the central character, we learn very little about John, other than that he is homeless, he identifies himself as being straight, he's not too bright and, well, that's about it.

I hated Ralph Fiennes as Oscar, wanting to jump into the film and cut his hair or give him a new hat and wardrobe. He plays a kind of holy fool, a sweet man overwhelmed by his own skinny limbs and awkward movements and tendency to have strange, non-epileptic fits. I appreciate the chances Fiennes takes here in playing such a character, but I'm afraid I prefer him as a romantic lead. Watching him in this role was as painful as it would be to watch, say, Brad Pitt play Lenny in Of Mice and Men--rather frustrating, and seemingly a waste of talent and good looks. Lucinda (Cate Blanchette) is a more sympathetic character, a tomboy shortening her skirts for greater freedom in an era of female repression. Still, why on earth would a business woman like Lucinda back the idea of making and transporting a solid glass church for some outback town in Australia, especially after several of her advisers point out that the congregation would surely be burned by the sun through the panes? Apparently, love of Oscar has blinded her to all reality. Or else it is her desperation to gamble that drives her do so despite all reason in this case.And the gambling! We know that respectable Christians at that time disapproved of gambling; and even today, gambling is perceived of as a dangerous addiction. Yet it still seems strange to see the social stigma Oscar and Lucinda face for their obsession. If these two characters kept losing, say, the rent money or food for their families, the social approbation might be more understandable. But they both win all the time. Besides, neither has a family, Lucinda is already rich, and Oscar gives his winnings to charity, so who is hurt by their betting?

I hated Ralph Fiennes as Oscar, wanting to jump into the film and cut his hair or give him a new hat and wardrobe.

Lucinda (Cate Blanchette) is a more sympathetic character, a tomboy shortening her skirts for greater freedom in an era of female repression. Still, why on earth would a business woman like Lucinda back the idea of making and transporting a solid glass church for some outback town in Australia, especially after several of her advisers point out that the congregation would surely be burned by the sun through the panes?

It's about Amelie, a shy, day-dreaming, waitress who enjoys life's simple pleasures. One day, Amelie finds a small tin box in her house, and decides to return it to it's owner, the first in a long line of people who's lives she will make better (and worse) over the course of the film. On the surface, this could be just another quirky film popular with the more art-house types, but Amelie has a great emotional depth in it's central character that is unparallelled in any other film. Amelie is the poster girl for lonely, shy, weirdos everywhere who struggles to find love herself because she can't face reality. It's this subtle, quite distressing subtext that makes Amelie the great film it is and will surely be missed by those who don't make the connection with the character. Elsewhere, Amelie has great cinematography, script, acting, score and whether you notice or not, brilliant direction from the back on form Jean-Pierre Jenuet. On first viewing the film comes across a bit of a mystery. How is that gnome going all over the world? Who is the mysterious character who keeps getting his photo taken and throwing it away? But unlike some one-twist films, where once the mystery or twist is revealed there is no need for a repeat viewing, Amelie reveals depth in the characters within the main plot, and entertains with exchanges between the more minor characters, and a few very subtle sight gags. Right, problems... being this should be an impartial, critical review and all that, the one complaint I would have is that JPJ pushed the green a little too much on the DVD.

Once again, such paeans of praise for this good but by no means extraordinary work go beyond me. A lot of viewers seemed to have been conquered by this story which is basically a novel penned by Henri-Pierre Roché. The former reviewer at the Cahiers Du Cinéma who once lambasted major French filmmakers of the forties and the fifties was struck by the mix of improper and purity which suffused in the novel. This is what galvanized him to film this unique story, at least for him and for the supporters of the film.The first thing to bear in mind is that the starting point (two men and a women living together for a long period of their lives) isn't new. In 1933, Ernst Lubitsch had signed a work called Design for Living. This sparkling comedy already sheltered a menage à Trois and was much more enjoyable and accessible than Truffaut's arty work. Jules et Jim was also celebrated for its innovative directing and its stunning camera work. Okay, it's a bonus for the film but once again I could argue that there is nothing astounding about it. On the same year the movie opened in 1962, John Frankenheimer cranked out the mind-boggling the Mandchurian Candidate. It's not the same kind of film at all but I was much more very taken with the filmmaker's camera work which worked wonders to serve a far-fetched but thoroughly riveting story. Frankenheimer's magnum opus did better since it heralded the political thriller which had its hour or rather decade glory in the seventies with works like Alan J. Pakula's the Parallax View (1974). In Jules et Jim, the creative liberties dear to the New Wave clique are well present and enhanced to try to reflect the mood a sequence could convey, especially in the first half (before the war) which brims with happiness and lightness. The whole dovetailed to establish a good dose of escape and dream to the audience. Actually, Truffaut's movie is half successful in the way the first part (before the war) makes sense in my eyes. There is none disadvantage in watching a threesome of two men and a woman leading a freewheeling life without any major problems (financial or other). But after the war, the second part veers to a somber direction and things go wrong because their demeanors are elusive to my mind. I don't understand their actions, their motivations, especially Jules'. If he is so unfortunate with Catherine, then why doesn't he go away? Catherine's character seems to be dangerous because she jeopardizes Jules and Jim's friendship. Catherine's behavior and persona leave me baffled. What doesn't facilitate things is that she pronounces one cue which can infuriate the ones who aren't touched by this story I don't want to be understood. Besides, I do think that Truffaut's film is peppered with lines which seem ludicrous to me such as it's twenty to one, an angel is passing it's normal, angels pass at twenty of every hour.Jules et Jim is the Nouvelle Vague in all its splendor and its pretensions with an emphasis on the form rather than the content which remains unfathomable to me. Storytelling is not Truffaut's forte or otherwise it obeys to a form of logic which is out of reach to me. That's what I want to gently laugh at his contention that a film is a story and a story has to be told. Even in the cinema. But in spite of his tricks and devices to tell the steps of this story and make the characters likable (use of neutral voice-over), I'm not touched at all. What to say about the cast?

As someone pointed out at the time, no one was going to jump on Warren Beatty's even-more costly and dark Reds, because Beatty was one of us, while Michael Cimino had not achieved that status.But Heaven's Gate was also affected by a cultural change taking place at that time, the political move rightwards and toward a more unquestioning patriotism and enshrinement of the myth of the West (and the Western). A few years earlier, Cimino's demythologizing of the frontier might have seemed timely, fresh, and a necessary corrective. But by 1980, in the wake of the Reagan Revolution, it was thought of as nearly un-American.Which is a shame, because the film, seen from the vantage point of several decades away, is a fascinating and thought-provoking look at that particular time and place as a world where life was, in Hobbes's words, nasty, brutish, and short. Kristofferson plays James Averill, an upper-class Easterner who, in search of adventure, becomes a sheriff in Wyoming, where he finds himself having to lead a resistance by the settlers and squatters against an attack by a mercenary death-squad hired by wealthy landowners, including Averill's lifelong best friend. In a more innocent time, Averill and his rag-tag army of poor farmers would emerge triumphant; but this is anything but a traditional Western, and when the U.S. Cavalry joins the fight here, it isn't on the side of the good guys.Much like The Deer Hunter, Cimino's previous film, Heaven's Gate spends a great deal of time building up the details of the lives of its principals, giving the film an at-times leisurely pace that nevertheless leads to a gripping conclusion. With excellent acting, a fine musical score, and the visual texture that makes one believe one is actually seeing the Old West through new eyes, Heaven's Gate is a film that rewards repeat viewings. I only wish that MGM would put out a new DVD, with an improved transfer and a commentary by Cimino. Nonetheless, the current version is satisfactory enough to let viewers see what critics in 1980, possibly blinded by the film's cultural subtexts, managed to miss...that Heaven's Gate is a great film.

The story revolves around a bold, daring, and overconfident navy fighter pilot, Lieutenant Pete Mitchell (call name 'Maverick'), who is sent to the Top Gun Naval Flying School along with his close pal, Goose. Maverick strives to prove himself the best pilot in this demanding course, but faces both stiff competition from a fellow pilot named Iceman as well as personal conflict dealing with his own haunting demons following the mysterious death of his father, also an air ace pilot. Meanwhile, he falls for a lovely civilian astrophysics instructor, Charlotte (Charlie) Blackwood.Tom Cruise is well cast in the role of the hotshot pilot...the cocky, audacious, fearless, but ultimately conflicted and anguished Maverick. Kelly McGillis portrays his often antagonistic love interest, Charlie, who's as smart as she is pretty. Other stars include Tom Skerrit as a real top gun flight instructor, Commander Metcalf (Viper), who proves to be both a skilled and professional pilot but also a compassionate individual. Meg Ryan appears in her screen debut as Goose's perky, fun loving young wife, Carole Bradshaw, a minor role and one which I personally found rather irritating.I half expected that I'd find this movie just all too macho, but it's actually quite engaging to watch. Maverick's personal story, his inner strife, and his romance with Charlie prove less riveting than the incredible airborne stunts with these jets. Yes, they have to be among the best aerial shots ever. This film was made during the Cold War era with its USSR enmity so there are appearances by enemy Russian MiG fighters, naturally cast as the intrusive villains of the piece. The film also does a great job at depicting all the male bonding between these pilots...the camaraderie, rivalry, banter, inter dependency, and genuine close friendship.Maverick is a fighter pilot who, according to Charlie, is only happy when he's 'going Mach Two with his hair on fire'. He's heard to remark just prior to climbing into the cockpit, 'I feel the need for speed'. He also takes great delight in unexpected and forbidden fly byes next to the control tower, scaring the living daylights out of his colleagues and causing them to spill their coffee.

People who are uptight have trouble with his 'Jerk' humor; much like the other great jerk, Jerry Lewis. Second, the film deliberately breaks the invisible barrier between 'them' on the stage or in the movie & us; the watchers. Things like switching to the sound stage hokey set for the camp scene are calculated to rub a sore spot on those who must have total continuity of style & no bending of the illusion of a real life experience. We call these people unsophisticated (there are other less kind terms). All these 'change-ups' in style, back references to the fact that this is only a movie & bending of the rules of continuity\/ suspension of dis-belief are tailor made to get under the skin of those who cannot separate themselves from the work itself.

Believe me, the world-class LOS ANGELES TIMES could have played a much bigger role of notifying the world on this pandemic. There were so many causes to identify when it was finally decided it was a virus, I was further shocked to discover how public officials were so unconcerned, that it would only infect gays. THAT made me think that the common cold is also a virus does it infect only a certain segment of society? Get real !! Because I made my living for so many decades as an entertainer talking face-to-face with people, I talk a lot. I did just that, for about 15 years. I couldn't fathom that scientists could be so dumb, so I started from scratch - not knowing which way to turn - to expose those who were making take-it-for-granted statements.Some way or other, I got my foot in the door - you'd be surprised how many scientists and high-office politicians helped. I learned a lot, right quick. I went to public symposiums held by the doctor who discovered how a certain group of gay men were all infected by a single individual. I particularly remember a symposium I attended - in the then newly-created city of West Hollywood - for nurses and health-care providers. The main topic it was discussing was what do gay people do, sexually? In the city of Boys Town and heavy hustling on most of its streets? You can be certain I shocked them all by stating the same things you and your sexual partners do, sexually, but aren't talking about it here. I eventually gave-up - I was writing to scientists all over the world; I had contacts in CDC, WHO, Institut Pasteur (where the virus was originally discovered); Congress; state legislatures - I just had too much data to comprehend.....and knew that by the time I was ready to do the exposure, it would be years down the road, and too late. FINALLY, THE LOST ANGELES TIMES has printed an article about Dr. Tony Fauci at NIH that advises EVERYONE under 64 be tested - 250,000 Americans do not know they are infected. I know people who have been infected for 25 years......still healthy....I agree that Philadelphia came too late in the pandemic, also, but knew millions of people STILL are ignorant about it - denial ! I've read every comment. I am going to watch the film again tonight, although it is vivid in my mind. Tom Hanks deserved the Oscar simply by having the courage - or being paid so much money - to do the role; not too much acting going-on, but effective. Can you believe that Banderas, today, isn't even listed in the cast of IMDb.com? I thought he was excellent in the film, as was Joanne Woodward playing the stalwart mother - the whole family was played so well. Those family-members who disown a member simply because he's gay need to see a shrink. How could Scubergmu definitely know that gays don't have supporting families ? On comments on Washington, many of them got his character right as being homophobic. However, they missed the point of the library scene - after hiding behind books and seeing Beckett being harassed by a librarian - did you find a lawyer? - I'm a lawyer. He became hooked to take the case by the brilliant understanding Beckett had of the legal data. He didn't suddenly become friendly - he may have even determined this would be a big case and he wouldn't have to spend so much money on TV-ads. His character developed from that point, with the compassionate help of his wife. Washington was superb.Demme's direction was right-on. Is anyone so naive to not know that Hollywood is well-versed in homosexuality ?....after all their cover-ups ? No matter how late in the pandemic this film appeared, it's still a powerful story. That this group of people finally found the gumption to release it deserves whatever awards it earned. Someone wrote the party scene had no drag-queens did you miss Mona Lisa ?I could write forever about this film, but feel everyone should get it and study it. One viewing can't give you an enlightened viewpoint. I give it 15-out-10 - so frightening this scourge is spreading, rather-than being defeated. Watch this movie with an open heart.

You can be certain I shocked them all by stating the same things you and your sexual partners do, sexually, but aren't talking about it here. I eventually gave-up - I was writing to scientists all over the world; I had contacts in CDC, WHO, Institut Pasteur (where the virus was originally discovered); Congress; state legislatures - I just had too much data to comprehend.....and knew that by the time I was ready to do the exposure, it would be years down the road, and too late. FINALLY, THE LOST ANGELES TIMES has printed an article about Dr. Tony Fauci at NIH that advises EVERYONE under 64 be tested - 250,000 Americans do not know they are infected. I know people who have been infected for 25 years......still healthy....I agree that Philadelphia came too late in the pandemic, also, but knew millions of people STILL are ignorant about it - denial ! I've read every comment. I am going to watch the film again tonight, although it is vivid in my mind. Tom Hanks deserved the Oscar simply by having the courage - or being paid so much money - to do the role; not too much acting going-on, but effective. Can you believe that Banderas, today, isn't even listed in the cast of IMDb.com? I thought he was excellent in the film, as was Joanne Woodward playing the stalwart mother - the whole family was played so well. Those family-members who disown a member simply because he's gay need to see a shrink. How could Scubergmu definitely know that gays don't have supporting families ? On comments on Washington, many of them got his character right as being homophobic. However, they missed the point of the library scene - after hiding behind books and seeing Beckett being harassed by a librarian - did you find a lawyer? - I'm a lawyer. He became hooked to take the case by the brilliant understanding Beckett had of the legal data. He didn't suddenly become friendly - he may have even determined this would be a big case and he wouldn't have to spend so much money on TV-ads. His character developed from that point, with the compassionate help of his wife. Washington was superb.Demme's direction was right-on. Is anyone so naive to not know that Hollywood is well-versed in homosexuality ?....after all their cover-ups ? No matter how late in the pandemic this film appeared, it's still a powerful story. That this group of people finally found the gumption to release it deserves whatever awards it earned. Someone wrote the party scene had no drag-queens did you miss Mona Lisa ?I could write forever about this film, but feel everyone should get it and study it.

Believe me, the world-class LOS ANGELES TIMES could have played a much bigger role of notifying the world on this pandemic. There were so many causes to identify when it was finally decided it was a virus, I was further shocked to discover how public officials were so unconcerned, that it would only infect gays. THAT made me think that the common cold is also a virus does it infect only a certain segment of society? Get real !! Because I made my living for so many decades as an entertainer talking face-to-face with people, I talk a lot. I did just that, for about 15 years. I couldn't fathom that scientists could be so dumb, so I started from scratch - not knowing which way to turn - to expose those who were making take-it-for-granted statements.Some way or other, I got my foot in the door - you'd be surprised how many scientists and high-office politicians helped. I learned a lot, right quick. I went to public symposiums held by the doctor who discovered how a certain group of gay men were all infected by a single individual.

The citizens of the film's dystopian society are beautiful on the outside, but in contrast to the aesthetic societal standards of today, beauty on the surface is not enough here. Humans have been genetically engineered to be perfect, right down to the very cells of which they are made. This adds an additional layer to the outside\/inside conflict with which we are all faced in 2006; today, there is beauty on two levels the bodily level and the spiritual level (i.e., the person inside, as a simplified description). In Gattaca, these layers still exist, but the third is perhaps most important -- beauty on a cellular level.Vincent Freeman, played by Ethan Hawke in a nuanced and moving performance, is a testament to the fallibility of genetic engineering. At birth, he was never given a chance, his parents having been told with 99% certainty that he would develop a heart condition and die by age 30. He has always dreamed of leaving the world that is so prejudiced against the naturally born, the flawed, and finding his place in the infinite realm of space. However, the hotshot scientists at Gattaca -- the preeminent aerospace institute of the era -- let him in only to be a common janitor. Why invest in someone so certain to fail?Vincent is not content to watch, day after day, as manned rockets are sent into space to do the research and exploration for which he so desperately craves. He knows that despite what geneticists and doctors have said, he is as good as all, better than most. With the help of a shady underground businessman (Shalhoub), Vincent takes on a new identity Jerome Morrow. The real Jerome (Law) had been a world-class swimmer before an accident left him paralyzed, confined to a wheelchair. Vincent changes his hair, gets colored corrective lenses, and follows an austere daily regimen to eliminate traces of his own in-valid DNA, to be replaced by conspicuously placed samples from the genetically flawless Jerome. When the narrative picks up, Vincent, posing as Jerome, has a prominent place at Gattaca and is one week away from taking a year-long voyage to Titan, one of Saturn's moons. With the murder of a director at Gattaca, however, his secret identity is thrown in jeopardy; crime scene investigators are determined to find the culprit, and a rogue eyelash leads them to the in- valid Vincent Freeman, whom nobody connects to the Jerome Morrow they know and respect.From this premise, which is created subtly and smoothly by Niccol, Gattaca truly takes off. Thurman's performance as Vincent's love interest, Irene, is pitch-perfect; she plays the character with a coolly detached elegance appropriate for the futuristic dystopia while maintaining a sympathetic air of humanity. The relationship between Hawke's and Thurman's characters feels genuine (as it should, considering the actors' subsequent marriage), and that between Vincent and his cellularly perfect brother Anton (Dean) is complex but easily understood on a basic, universal level. Many moments between the brothers are among the most poignant captured on film, especially in the science fiction genre (of which I am not normally a huge fan, but this movie is just remarkable).I have watched this film several times and have yet to tire of it. Though many pictures have been able to pull off sleek, futuristic looks, few of these have anything below the surface. Gattaca does, and it packs an emotional punch. There is a remarkably small number of movies that feel nearly perfect to me; Gattaca is one of them. I would not change a single thing about it even if I could. The characters are fully developed, the plot is intriguing and compelling, the cinematography and sets are beautiful. What is truly amazing about Gattaca, however, is its ability to develop and show its viewers something absolutely vital what it means to be human.

This film just drips quality throughout with its terrific direction, acting, singing, writing and production. While not the best MGM film ever made, it certainly is among the best musicals they made. That's because not only are there a modest number of songs, but those in the film are awfully enjoyable--particularly the final song, HAVE YOURSELF A MERRY LITTLE Christmas. It was pure magic and is probably Judy Garland's best adult performance--she is radiant and on the top of her game.I think another reason I love this movie so is that it is not just a bunch of songs thrown at the audience, but a very enjoyable slice of life film about a wonderful family filled with great characters. From the tough but loving father to the bratty littlest child (played by Margaret O'Brien in her best performance), they all are special and sweet without being too saccharine.This makes a wonderful Christmas movie and is best viewed on Christmas Eve with the lights turned low.FYI--If you have a chance, get a hold of the wonderful two-disk set. The second disk has an amazing set of extras--enough to keep you very busy and very happy.
