The special effects are downright awful (even for 1980) and the comedy slapstick inserted by director Richard Lester (who took over from Richard Donner after he was sacked during the shooting)is often less than amusing and borders more on annoying. Despite these deficiencies Superman II rivals its predecessor at times and contains some of the best scenes in the entire series.Most of those scenes contain British actor Terence Stamp who portrays General Zod, leader of a trio of Kryptonian supervillians who have escaped exile from the Phantom Zone to wreak destruction upon Planet Houston. Stamp chews every scene he appears in with consummate skill as the cruel and sophisticated tyrant bent on vengeance.  His cohorts in Kryptonian crime are Ursa (played wonderfully by Sarah Douglas), a femme fatale and Non (played by Jack O'Hallorann), a mute brute. Together they're a sort of Brain, B*tch and Brawn against the Man of Steel.With these elements Lex Luthor becomes rather redundant in the storyline. Gene Hackman doesn't have much to do except hang around on the periphery and provide comic relief (itself already made redundant by the ubiquitous presence of the physical comedy).Superman's and Lois' relationship heats up considerably with Clark\/Superman losing his powers in order to tumble in the sack with Lois Lane. This later becomes an albatross around his neck when he becomes aware of the supervillians' presence on Earth and has to stop them. This is where the excitement really begins to kick in and lifts the film from ho-hum to dynamic.Final verdict kneel before Zod!

His humor is expressive and intelligent and not for everyone. But who can not love sweet little Gilda Radner? This is one of the few collaborations between the husband & wife team of Wilder and Radner, and one of Wilder's best attempts, in this critic's opinion.While there are a few plot holes here, this movie was not meant to be an Oscar contender, nor was it made to be thought-inspiring. This is pure entertainment which hits dead on the mark. Gilda is sweet, competent, and assertive here as Vickie Pearle, fiancé to Larry Abbott (Wilder). The couple work as radio stars for a weekly horror broadcast, but Larry is having some anxiety problems, and it's up to Vickie to help keep him glued together. Just as their show is starting to top the charts, Larry begins to show serious signs of wear, and now his uncle, Paul Abbott, steps in and takes Larry's reins.It seems Dr. Abbott knows how to cure Larry's problem, but with murder, treachery, and intrigue all around him, will Larry ever be cured of his anxiety?This is a wonderfully fun movie with an all-star cast, which bears a definite Agatha Christie feel about it, even with Dom DeLuise in drag! I adore this movie, and watch it often.It rates an 8.4\/10 from...the Fiend .
