I was thinking about it for a long time after and when I got to catch it recently on TV it made me think about it all over again and it this time raises some questions and.I didn't find it as good the second time round. I have watched it many times since I first saw but the recent viewing I was paying more attention than ever. I still think Keanu Reeves was maybe not right as Kevin Lomax. He has great moments but I think he has to many moments where he is trying to act is ass off and making it look obvious. Is it me or in some scenes where Keanu is talking he sounds like Elvis with his accent. Just a thought. Al Pacino was perfect as John Milton but again he was a bit over the top but makes up for it in his charm and charisma which he tackles head on easily through the movie. The best acting we get here is from Charlize Theron which is no surprise to me considering how well she has done since in films like Monster. The story doesn't really kick off till the very end where everything unfolds very fast to a massive climax which without this film would have failed badly. I don't know much about Taylor Hackford's previous work but I am impressed with how he handled The Devils Advocate and if he directs an y others films of this caliber then he might be poised to win an huge award of sort. The film is just not about paranormal goings on with Satan, it is also a law film which actually makes being a lawyer look like a lot of fun with a lot of tension thrown in. If any adrenaline junkie wanted to go for a mainstream job then a lawyer would be his cup of tea as Kevin Lomax will show you.The direction, music, cinematography and nearly everything about this film is perfect. The story is quite close but towards the end there is just to many revelations that happen all to quick and it gives you this feeling that the film is getting a bit silly and that's how I feel about it now. If you haven't seen it before and you are wanting to see it for yourself then you should see it without a doubt. Don't let any review including mine put you off as this as the movie is one hell of a ride but it may raise questions of how much they tried to cram inside the movie in the time it had. It does run for nearly two and a half hours but they run quicker than you can imagine and as soon as the film finishes you will be wanting to watch it all over again so you can see where everything makes sense.Al Pacino does pack a punching performance to the very end and is as crazy as ever if a little over the top at times but without him we wouldn't be talking about this film as much.

I managed to return the DVD so I don't feel so bad about it now, but I haven't felt so p*ssed off in ages as I did after watching this piece of trash. I've seen a lot of bad movies in my time, but while I laughed at the likes of Skyscraper and Extreme Limits I actually felt physically ill after seeing this.The front cover of the DVD shows The Exterminator with a flamethrower, and on the back it said it was a video classic and had some awe inspiring car chase. All I really expected was an action movie. But this has no real action, the apparent car chase was virtually non existent and everything is handled in such a sloppy manner that it fails on all counts. It fails as an action flick as it's far too slow, and is far too stupid to pass as a crime drama.Let's start with the lead. Robert Ginty ranks beside Michael Dudikoff as one of the least effective action heroes I've ever seen. He only has one facial expression, one tone of voice and delivers all his lines so flatly and it doesn't help that at no point does he even look tough or menacing at all, which makes him rather hard to accept as a Vietnam vet. With the exception of Steve James, nobody looks the slightest bit interested in the material which hardly comes off as much of a surprise. Now Steve James would have made a far more interesting lead as he actually has genuine charisma, knows martial arts and above all has the looks of an action hero. All three of which Ginty completely lacks.All this could be forgiven if there was good action, right? Well it would be impossible for me to accept Robert Ginty as an action hero but even if we were to overlook that, the only action there is handled terribly. Ginty kills the gang who attacked Steve James very early on, and really that should be the movie over. But no, he needlessly decides to go around killing several criminals who were completely unrelated to this in the most gruesome of ways. He lowers a mobster into a meat grinder not because he felt like getting him off the streets, but for the money. Yes, the money. What sickened me so much about that was that the guy was completely helpless suspended over that meat grinder, but Ginty lowers him into it anyway. Some hero. And we knew very little about this character anyway so how were we meant to feel he deserved that? The plot is largely driven by coincidence and moves very slowly. By the halfway mark he has only killed a few people so if you're expecting a fast paced over the top bodycount actioner like the Death Wish sequels, think again. I could barely call this a vigilante flick at all.We are treated to some gruesome images of burnt corpses and a hooker with her breasts burnt. Also, at the start we are treated with a poorly done but gruesome all the same beheading which is included for no reason at all. Don't get me wrong, I'm not against violence in movies at all, but with a movie where everything is handled so incompetently and the only thing that makes it stand out is some needlessly gruesome graphic violence, I really do think that is wrong. Not to mention the lack of any suspense or tension the movie has. The action scenes that surround it are incredibly flat, usually missing key shots and mostly not accompanied by any musical score, they could hardly be less exciting. And the highlight car chase which was mentioned on the back of the box is short, and handled just as poorly as the rest of the action scenes. Basically, this is a cheap, derivative movie which relies on brutally gruesome graphic violence as an attempt to cover up a horribly wretched and poorly made movie. The only things I found remotely interesting were the somewhat novel way the cop cooks his hot dog and some nice aerial views of New York at the start and finish. When one of the best parts of the whole movie is at the closing credits, you know you're in trouble. Unless you want to punish yourself, then avoid like the plague.

The family now lives happily ever after, with both parents now getting along marvelously (with lots of kissing, too!) and the young, impressionable son agrees to not talk to strangers anymore.The plot is fiendishly predictable and boring, and the characters are ones that are often used as well the athletic, courageous, intelligent, protective, and pretty much flawless mother (Meryl Streep), her loser husband (David Strathairn) who later on in the film gets to show that he does have some good qualities as well!

Nobody else's performance stood out that much, although nobody did that bad of a job; just nothing spectacular. Personally, I would have expected Meryl Streep to have done a better job; she's renowned for being an excellent actress, but I wasn't particularly swept away by her performance.The setting was perfect, and the scenery was beautiful - it really complimented the movie, and the camera work showed it off perfectly, with lots of zooming out to demonstrate the whole scene, then zooming back in to focus on the actors again. Definitely a high point. Unfortunately, this was ruined by the theme song to the movie, which although started out beautiful, was terribly overused, and started to really grate on the viewer's nerves after it was replayed (sometimes by different instruments, which didn't really do much) for the 50th time, or so. It would have been much better, (and more successful at keeping the audience awake) had they varied the music a little bit.Overall, it wasn't a bad movie, and it was handled well enough, but they were stuck with a storyline that had been used way too many times before which flattened the mood.

For some reason, I must have blocked out any evidence of this movie's existence from my mind as soon as I heard of it four years ago. I say this because as I cannot remember this major movie's release at all.It might as well have stayed that way, because this is a horrible movie. One might look at a trailer for a cheerleader movie and go, What a boring concept. This is probably going to be a boring, flat movie. Well, that person would be completely correct.To sum up the plot of Bring It On, I would have to say there isn't much of one. The primary story revolves around a cheer competition, and apparently the cheer team's old leader stole all of their routines from an inner city school. This means they have to come up with a new routine from scratch with the competition right around the corner, or suffer humiliation.As gripping as that sounds, it's pretty hard to feel compassion for the protagonists. There isn't anything riding on the idea that they must win, and the characters seem cliché at best. Kirsten Dunst plays the new head cheerleader with a strong sense of justice, Eliza Dushku is the new recruit bad girl, and the rest have typical valley girl accents and attitudes. The friction between Eliza and the rest of the girls seems to disappear quickly into the movie for no reason, and after that, the whole team is pretty uniformly uninteresting.The worst part of the movie would have to be the rival cheer team that they had stolen all their dance routines from. I am shamed at the women who played those roles, because they've set back minorities 30 years at least. The wise-talking, street-fighting, finger-snapping group of African Americans and other minorities are a walking satire of hip-hop culture.The biggest surprise of the movie is when I found out that it's a comedy. The reason that's a surprise is because it's not funny. There are a few cute moments, but I wouldn't say there were any guffaw-worthy scenes. A few jokes I concede that I enjoyed. Those aren't spirit fingers. THESE are spirit fingers.There is a bright side to this movie, though shallow it very much is. In every single scene, they somehow manage to get Kirsten Dunst in very telling and alluring outfits. They somehow manage to accentuate her breasts in every part of the movie without having to show cleavage most of the time. That being said, the highlight of the movie for me was the carwash scene where Eliza and Kirsten both were covered in soap-lather while wearing small bikinis. Honestly, moments like that were the only thing that kept me awake through the movie.

This is the what the movie is actually about and the lesbian aspect of it is actually almost secondary. Think about it ... replace the girl falling in love with girl concept and replace it with some other socially challenging category (perhaps a cross-culture or cross-religion love story), and it would still work. In fact, ironically, the director\/writer eventually married a guy, much to some people's chagrin! lolThe movie is rough as many an indie film is and the actors are young (this was Nicole Ari Parker's first film) or somewhat amateurish. Still, the basic relationships hold true. The girls and their mom\/aunt, the other romances that don't quite work out, and their friends all are believable, though some match up better than others. How Randy and Evie connect through Leaves of Grass might be a bit trite, but I believed it -- imagine, a film that respected the power of poetry! And, I did accept them as a couple. Young love is pretty well portrayed, and in fact, how many films these days really portray it? Not too many really -- the films are often more concerned with stereotypical plot complications than the romance, and even those come far and long inbetween. This alone makes the film a pleasure, though the lesbian aspect supplies an additional layer. And as to that layer, this is probably one of the superior films of the genre. To compare, for instance, this is better than Better Than Chocolate. Again, it can very well be a matter of taste (lol). The ending is a bit silly though, but the scene before the final reel (the mom freaking out) is priceless. Still, the ending suggests that this is first love, not necessarily forever. A good thing too.-jPS It was suggested that this was eye candy for men or just for lesbians. I beg to differ in both respects.

It's one of those reasons why, for all its skimpy production values, 'the Cat from Outer Space' is now such a refreshing blast from the past &#150; in an era swamped by crude, flashy animal movies made exclusively for the under-12 market, this is comes across as quite a pleasant piece of nostalgia, harking back to the good old days when the humour was always clean, and any critter who wanted to wrap their tongue around the English language did so the conveniently telepathic way. (Yikes, I'm starting to sound like a right old whinger here, which really I'm not, but that's just how jaded I am).As a stand-alone film, TCFOS is very much a cheesy but warm-hearted affair and, for fans of all things sublime n' feline like myself, this was a childhood classic growing up in the 1980s. Back then, it always qualified as my runner-up pick for Disney's coolest live action feature, second only to the original 'Incredible Journey' (yeah, I *did* watch Mary Poppins', but never really got much further than the animated sequences &#150; it just got boring after that). I happened to come across it on my shelves recently, having left it undisturbed for several years, and decided it was time for a revisit.The worst thing about it is inevitably the title (which just screams 'B Movie!', don't it?), only just managing to pip some of the flat and, quite frankly, irritating human characters on display to the post, who've more-or-less accepted that churning out even Oscar-worthy performances ain't gonna spare them from being upstaged by the four-legged favourite. Sandy Duncan in particular portrays a bimbo so staggering it'll make your jaw drop that she even made it into the paranormal research department (plus, she believes all of Frank's lame excuses &#150; yikes, how dumb is she?). Then there's that spy character who insists on speaking with such loathsome smarminess not seen since 'the Shop Around the Corner', you could break your TV screen trying to sock him one in the mouth.The best things about TCFOS, oddly enough, owe a lot to the retrospectives we have after 26 years. Jake is definitely entitled to feel smug that he was getting himself stranded on planet Earth, amongst all the typically hostile folks, and making his human ally's bicycle fly *four freakin' years* before ET showed up on the scene (is that uncanny or what?). Not to mention the casually conniving fashion in which Jake goes about trying to secure his way back home, somehow managing to involve rigged sports games along the way; ethics so dodgy by today's standards that really you gotta love it. And the special effects are now so crude and outdated that, well, they're cute! Jake is undeniably the star of this vehicle, churning out all the better lines of dialogue, and this is such an endearing story deep down that it's all too bad that the script never delves particularly deeply into his friendship with Frank (after all, ET's major trump card was always his lump-in-the-throat relationship with Elliot), choosing instead to skim through the character interactions at such a pace that the film never really has the chance to deliver any true emotional wallop.I did also get a kick out of reading the previous comment concerning the body language of the feline double act playing Jake, and will verify it all the way &#150; pay close attention to the climax in particular, and note that the poor kitty currently on the scene looks positively bewildered!Sure, it's imperfect and now that I'm older I can see where the faults lie a lot more than I used to &#150; but still, it's a likable and evocative romp, and personally I'd much rather be subject to this than to recent animal conspiracy theory trash like 'Cats and Dogs' or 'Good Boy!', any day.

Sure, the only thing we can attribute this merit to is its age &#150; as others round here have already pointed out, were this movie shot in this day and age the overused and overplayed technique would have undoubtedly been employed. I also imagine that, at some point during the running time, they'd have Jake spit up a big slimy hairball, mark his territory over some sucker's flowerbed, and stick a leg in the air so he can lick at his crotch &#150; along with any other animal bodily function they could swipe a gag out of. It's one of those reasons why, for all its skimpy production values, 'the Cat from Outer Space' is now such a refreshing blast from the past &#150; in an era swamped by crude, flashy animal movies made exclusively for the under-12 market, this is comes across as quite a pleasant piece of nostalgia, harking back to the good old days when the humour was always clean, and any critter who wanted to wrap their tongue around the English language did so the conveniently telepathic way. (Yikes, I'm starting to sound like a right old whinger here, which really I'm not, but that's just how jaded I am).As a stand-alone film, TCFOS is very much a cheesy but warm-hearted affair and, for fans of all things sublime n' feline like myself, this was a childhood classic growing up in the 1980s. Back then, it always qualified as my runner-up pick for Disney's coolest live action feature, second only to the original 'Incredible Journey' (yeah, I *did* watch Mary Poppins', but never really got much further than the animated sequences &#150; it just got boring after that). I happened to come across it on my shelves recently, having left it undisturbed for several years, and decided it was time for a revisit.The worst thing about it is inevitably the title (which just screams 'B Movie!', don't it?), only just managing to pip some of the flat and, quite frankly, irritating human characters on display to the post, who've more-or-less accepted that churning out even Oscar-worthy performances ain't gonna spare them from being upstaged by the four-legged favourite. Sandy Duncan in particular portrays a bimbo so staggering it'll make your jaw drop that she even made it into the paranormal research department (plus, she believes all of Frank's lame excuses &#150; yikes, how dumb is she?).

I had nearly forgotten about this movie for some reason, although there's enough memorable about it to tell a friend about it.The story of a Southern governor's rise from obscure democratic primary candidate to president of the United States is shown in this amalgam of a movie. I'm still not quite sure how to classify it. It has too many heavy moments to be a pure comedy. It's too silly and light-hearted at moments to be a straight drama. It's not insulting enough to be a satire, and it's not self-promoting enough to be a propaganda piece.It encorporates many elements, yet it somehow all flows brilliantly together. All the actors give above-average performances, especially Kathy Bates, the over-the-top, aging, lesbian, hippie cowgirl who digs the dirt for her friend Jack Stanton. Bates steals every scene she's in, and brings us the highest and lowest points of the movie, emotionally.One thing I will say is this movie is best if you don't think about it too hard. If you go into the movie, thinking, I heard this was based on Clinton, then you're going to be confused and disappointed. There are parallels between Stanton and Clinton, from the voice and appearance, to their Southern governor origins, to sex allogations, but it's not a biographical piece in the slightest. It's a story all its own, and this movie and the book it's based on deserve to be treated as such.

It is not a comedy but rather a dramedy that explores marriages and relationships of four main characters. It has several funny moments and dialogs (it is Allen after all) but it has disturbing and sad scenes, too.When Jack and Sally (Sidney Pollack and Judy Davis) announce that they're separating, this comes as a shock to their best friends Gabe and Judy (Allen and Farrow). They start to reevaluate their own marriage only to find out that it is not as perfect as they thought. Very soon Jack and Sally, and then Gabe and Judy start to meet new people - young, bright, and attractive. They all hope that new is better, and for some of them it is true while the others come to understanding that true love involves loving another's imperfections even when very well aware of them. This film is for all husbands and wives, lovers, and partners around the world. It is for couples who've been in a relationship for a month, a year, or decades. It is for singles who are ready or who think they want to enter a relationship. It is also for people who don't. All of us have been or may find ourselves in a situation or relationship or having a conversation like the ones in the Allen's film. All of us think and talk about love, trust, understanding, fidelity, sex, and yes - marriage. The best scenes of the film belong to Allen and Farrow. Some of their conversations in the movie probably reflect the situation in their own relationship that ended soon after the film was made. It is the last film Allen made with Farrow. Judy Davis played the role of her carrier practically stealing the film. I was shocked to find out that she received all possible Critics Awards that year and lost Best Supporting Oscar to Marisa Tomei. I love Tomei's performance in My Cousin Vinny (1992) but nomination itself would've been enough. Davis was the Best Supporting actress (I saw all films with nominated performances). Sidney Pollack (The Oscar winning director of Out of Africa and two times nominee for Tootsie and They Shoot Horses, Don't They?) and Liam Nisson were wonderful. I did not like Juliet Lewis at all.

It is not a comedy but rather a dramedy that explores marriages and relationships of four main characters. It has several funny moments and dialogs (it is Allen after all) but it has disturbing and sad scenes, too.When Jack and Sally (Sidney Pollack and Judy Davis) announce that they're separating, this comes as a shock to their best friends Gabe and Judy (Allen and Farrow). They start to reevaluate their own marriage only to find out that it is not as perfect as they thought. Very soon Jack and Sally, and then Gabe and Judy start to meet new people - young, bright, and attractive. They all hope that new is better, and for some of them it is true while the others come to understanding that true love involves loving another's imperfections even when very well aware of them. This film is for all husbands and wives, lovers, and partners around the world. It is for couples who've been in a relationship for a month, a year, or decades. It is for singles who are ready or who think they want to enter a relationship. It is also for people who don't. All of us have been or may find ourselves in a situation or relationship or having a conversation like the ones in the Allen's film. All of us think and talk about love, trust, understanding, fidelity, sex, and yes - marriage. The best scenes of the film belong to Allen and Farrow. Some of their conversations in the movie probably reflect the situation in their own relationship that ended soon after the film was made. It is the last film Allen made with Farrow. Judy Davis played the role of her carrier practically stealing the film. I was shocked to find out that she received all possible Critics Awards that year and lost Best Supporting Oscar to Marisa Tomei. I love Tomei's performance in My Cousin Vinny (1992) but nomination itself would've been enough. Davis was the Best Supporting actress (I saw all films with nominated performances). Sidney Pollack (The Oscar winning director of Out of Africa and two times nominee for Tootsie and They Shoot Horses, Don't They?) and Liam Nisson were wonderful. I did not like Juliet Lewis at all.

Many critics judged the film quite harshly, groaning about how it is inappropriate for a film to mix jokes and war. But in truth, Kelly's Heroes never pretends to be a serious wartime account - and the humorous undercurrent helps the film rather than hampering it.A bunch of American GIs are given a few days away from the battlefront during WWII. However, they are not overly impressed with the quiet, excessively peaceful and boozeless village where they've been told to relax. One member of the group, Kelly (Eastwood), has learned of a fortune in Nazi gold bullion hidden away in a bank in a German-occupied town some thirty or more miles behind enemy lines. He tells the other guys about it, and they decide to risk their lives to get hold of the hoard. Of course, pulling off a bank robbery is no easy task at the best of times, but when the bank is so far into enemy territory......Eastwood is suitably laid-back here, but the real stars of the show are Telly Savalas (dynamic and hilarious as Big Joe) and Donald Sutherland (a hippy tank driver so chilled-out he's happy to eat cheese, drink wine and sunbathe in the middle of a chaotic battle!) The pyrotechnics are well-orchestrated, and Troy Kennedy Martin invests the script with the kind of amusing banter and thrilling set pieces that he gave to The Italian Job a year earlier.

Films set in a bleak future are not. And yet Robocop effectively combines those two sub-genres and ends up being what is quoted to be the best science-fiction film since Metropolis. Although I haven't seen Metropolis, I know that Robocop is not the greatest science-fiction film in the last 50 years. Merely, it is a mediocre film, with cliché characters, a confusing plot with generic evil corporate bosses with basic names...the list goes on and on. What saves Robocop is just that-Robocop. He's probably the coolest fictional character ever created (well, either him or Grimace from McDonald's). Either way, it's the pure cool factor of Robocop that puts the movie from mediocrity to something to be remembered.Police officer Alex Murphy (Peter Weller) is brutally shot to death by thugs in a not-to-distant future Detroit, where a company's going to provide the police force with robots for cops. The prototype that's brought out screws up, so they decide to make Murphy into the title character. He's now Robocop, a cop that kicks ass and takes names, but has memories of his demise still lodged into his head. He decides to go out for revenge, as the company tries to kill him so they can put their robot on the market.As I said before, the action's just mediocre. There's some shooting and everything, but done generically. The best part isn't the action, thankfully. It's when there's stuff happening outside the action with Robocop. When he goes out to stop crime. He stops a rape by shooting a man in the genitals, which basically goes THROUGH the woman's dress. No human could do that, only the epitome of cool could Robocop. And Weller does a great job as the stone-faced cop, with just the little bit of emotion. Nancy Allen is the token hard-assed female on the force, who acts like she's in an 80's movie, so I guess that's OK. The film as a whole is never boring-Paul Verhoeven keeps everything rolling for it's short-but-sweet runtime, and I liked all of the pre-Starship Troopers attacks on America-Get them before they get you! I also liked what Verhoeven did with portraying Robocop as a modern day Jesus-it worked effectively. So the movie works for the most part-any time where Robocop is on the screen. If you can get past the generic feel of the rest of the movie, and just watch for Robocop, you'll love it.My rating 7\/10Rated R for strong violence and language.

His poor little brother was trying to make sense of everything that was going on in his world, and just when he was starting to understand it and learn how to change it, he was killed. If you do not like gruesome acts of violence, then this movie is not for you because there is one part, the part that shows you why the lead character goes to jail, that is unbelievably gruesome, you will think about it before you sleep, and probably during.

I'm a Persian myself and I've never come across meeting or even heard of such a family. I think this movie gives a completely wrong and distorted picture of what a Persian family is like.I live in Denmark, and a lot of my friends asked me after watching this movie, is it really like this in Iran. And of course I said 'NO'. Because it isn't. It's not Paradise either, but it's not that bad, as we see it here in this picture. I've noticed how this movie has affected people's vision of Iran in a wrong way.Third, it doesn't make sense to me at all.
