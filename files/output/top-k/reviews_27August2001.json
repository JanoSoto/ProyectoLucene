So the negative reviews for Three Kings don't surprise me at all, because I thought this movie was absolutely magnificent.Probably the best thing Three Kings has going for it is the low expectations one has prior to seeing it. It was promoted as an action\/comedy, and while it won't disappoint fans of that genre, it has a much deeper message that very few action or comedy films manage to get across. In fact I thought it was perhaps surprising that Hollywood produced a film which tackles a rather touchy topic (for Americans) in such a head on fashion.The movie starts with plenty of naivety and lighthearted humour. The American soldiers complain of being bored and are have no idea about the politics of the Gulf War. The battle is over, the war is won, and all that's left to do is to take a few POWs, be interviewed on CNN and go home. Which is fine as long as they stay in base camp, but when a few sneak out of camp to pinch some of Saddam's gold, they are confronted by the realities of the war for the Iraqi people and start to suspect that the US might not be the good samaritans they had hitherto believed.  The characterisations and the transition which takes place in all the characters over the course of the film is remarkably well done.Contrary to a couple of the reviews below, the movie is not anti-American and does not take Saddam's side but instead encourages the viewer to consider other perspectives of the Gulf War and points out that the US's approach to the war may have done more harm than good.  It's a point that has been made by plenty of commentators, but not many inside the US, and never in such an audience-friendly format. Three Kings is not only a jolly good film, but you may just learn something about US foreign policy. And if not, you can at least enjoy the exploding cow scene.

So if you don't want to know even minor details about the plot, do NOT read on... (but judging how much money the film made over the weekend, most of you have already seen this film...twice.)I went in to Tim Burton's PLANET OF THE APES really expecting to see one of the worst films ever. This was a surprise since I love every Tim Burton film I've ever seen (definitely not counting Batman 3 & 4 which he produced, but had no other evolvement and it shows). From his first big screen film Pee Wee's Big Adventure, to my favorite Ed Wood, to the recent Sleepy Hollow, I've admired his style and direction...though most of his films seem to have been edited overnight in some parts.His latest is a more faithful to the original book adaptation of the french book; Planet Of The Apes...and just so you don't get upset while watching the film, the book is NOT set on Earth like the original was. In case you were born in the eighties and never knew the joys of playing with the Mego toys of the same name back in the 70s, I'll explain the basic story. A guy gets trapped in a space-storm that flings him to a world where monkeys rule and people don't. Yep, that about sums it up.The book was adapted to film in the 70s starring Charlton Heston and a bunch of similar guys with beards. I believe that the original's sequel Return To The Planet Of The Apes won a special achievement award for Best Beard in a Speaking Role. Not much is known about what happened to those beards after the 70s. I'm sure we'll see an E True Hollywood Story about those beards one day, but I digress...Actually one of the first things that sticks out in this new version of Planet Of The Apes is the lack of beards on most of the human characters. Mark Whalberg (of Boogie Nights) plays beardless human astronaut Leo who trains geneticly engineered monkeys to fly spaceships. When one of his monkeys gets lost, he follows it into a space-storm that hurls him to the planet below. This is where the story most of you all know kicks in. Leo is hunted down by human-like bearded apes. Soon he meets a human woman named Daena, her father, a chimpanzee woman who believes in Human Rights, and an orangutan slave trader who deals in humans.So basically we get a peek into Ape society and meet General Thade played by Reservoir Dog star Tim Roth who hates all humans, but loves to jump around and make monkey noises.I won't give any more story away, but lets just say that man and monkey fight and surprisingly the Apes do NOT throw poo. If there is one way to catch a human off guard it would be to throw monkeypoo (which, by the way, is my 1 word review of the film Monkeybone) at them. Actually, if they did throw copies of the movie Monkeybone at the humans they would have surly been destroyed much like our own society almost was when it was released.Ok so I liked this movie... There were a few things that bugged me like the make-up on the female apes and all the wired jumping and, of course, some of the dialogue. But in the end it's a movie about a planet where apes rule and people don't (see 3rd paragraph above). It's campy and yet interesting.Mark Wahlberg continues to bury his Marky Marc image in a role in which Keanu Reaves would have said Whoa a lot like in all his films.Helena Bonham Carter's Ari character is actually interesting unlike Estella Warren's Daena character who stands around gape-mouthed for most of the film.The make-up is excellent. Can't get much better `cept for the female apes that I mentioned already.And, YES, there is a twist...just not the one you remember. Check it out. Also look for cameos by Danny DeVito and George Clooney. If you blink, you'll miss them.

The psychology of Hanks character is quite shallow and traditional, I wanted to know more, about his thoughts and dreams beyond merely wanting to return to civilization.

She was quite a straight arrow for all intents and purposes.  However, she still had to indulge herself with a little fling on the side, with her boss, a rather lifeless office drone played by Dan Akroyd.  Hunt's character-Fitzgerald-reminded me of Hot Lips Hoolahan on M*A*S*H.  On that show she was the high priestess of morality and decency; except when she and Frank engaged in a fairly torrid affair.  Helen Hunt carries off the role extremely well.  She is a very restrained actress.  She knows that less is more and she doesn't belabor points.I found the first half hour or so of the film quite slow, but after that, the film's conceit-that CW and Fitzgerald acted differently in the wake of their hypnotization-took hold and I found it quite funny.   The plot turns on the idea that CW and Fitzgerald have been hypnotized by a man, initially at a party for a co-worker, and then in phone calls.  They rob houses when he requests them to, and then can remember none of it the next day.  And, as investigators, they have to try to solve the crimes. Therefore of course, the trail is cold to them, although they will be viewed suspiciously due to various items that point to them.  They are investigating themselves but don't even know it.  They honestly deny having committed the crimes and are shocked to be accused.  Eventually of course, the scheme is unravelled. Woody Allen played a very unusual character for him.  Well, not really, he played himself once again.  If you haven't enjoyed his films before, you probably won't enjoy this one.  But his writing is as glib and witty as always.On another MASH related note, David Ogden Stiers portrays the man who hypnotizes Woody and Helen for his own ends.  He didn't have quite the same blueblood accent as he did in MASH but the eyes and the voice were fairly unmistakeable.  Dan Akroyd's acting was excellent as a rather dull office manager.  Charlize Theron was all legs and breasts as a spoiled rich girl, and Shannon Elizabeth had nothing much to do except tease her helpless co-workers.  One can never tell why Woody casts these parts.  Is he interested in creating that role due to its importance to the film, or does he just like working with young pretty actresses?Nevertheless, the film is very enjoyable and I would implore you not to fear the bite of the Scorpion.

It's a pretty universal one. I certainly know a lot of people that have dealt with it or are dealing with it right now. The scenery of Cornwall was gorgeous. So was a very young looking Catherine Zeta Jones. The movie is beautifully shot. It was also very humorous, especially when you know lots of people like the characters in this film. It struck me as very true to life. Ewan McGregor really made me laugh as a drug dealing hippy dude who secretly just wants to be respected. I kept thinking didn't I see that guy at a Dead show once? The whole film kind of reminded me of Santa Cruz with an English accent.

It's ranked 21st so please, the vast majority of people love this movie. The rating is a much better indicator than the reviews are on how people like a movie. I write reviews because I want to express my opinion, not because I have an unusually high ego. Now to the movie. It has a great story, fantastic beautiful art direction and cinamatography, and some of the best fight scenes ever on film. No performances in particular are spectacular, but they still all do a great job and the atmosphere is so great  that just their presense seems spectacular. The best movie of 2000 no question in my mind and by far the best martial arts movie ever made.

Marry an Australian were served with a natural self-depreciating humourI found Meg Ryan's performance a bit sketchy, but as I'm not a true fan of her's I don't pretend to say it didn't measure up to any of her other works.Peter Morse seemed quite convincing to me, although the way he provoked his kidnappers at some times seemed a bit weird.Australian by birth, it was a nice change to hear several different accents over the movie instead of the standard all-American or all-British, and the fact that this movie was designed and cast to handle this was refreshing.Probably one of the best 'real' movies I've seen. Well done to the cast and crew, especially those who had to work so hard up in the forest.

He has directed 5 films in a row, that have been in my mind all funny, often though provoking and just really good movies.  This is the fifth movie, the last of his New Jersey series with his always present Jay and Silent Bob, is not the best of his series but it is still possibly the funniest film I have seen this summer.  A consistently silly yet laugh out loud fest of jokes and usual one liners from Smith that scores well, even if it doesn't score as well as Dogma or Clerks.Here, the dynamic stoner duo find out through a weird new invention known as the internet (a place to bitch about movies and swap pornography) that a movie is being made about them, er, they're comic book alter egos from Chasing Amy known as Bluntman and Chronic.  They get so steamed they head for Miramax studios in Hollywood to stop the movie.  This starts the odyssey that brings up cameos including George Carlin (sick, but still funny), Carrie Fisher, Mark Hammil, and basically most of the stars from the past Smith movies.  This film is like a big inside joke, and if you get it, you'll like it more than others I guess.  But it is still funny for anyone who wants a good laugh and is tired of some of the really lame comedies of late.  It's a nice, if sometimes a little obscene (not in a bad way), gem.  One more note, not only does the movie bring mack many of the past stars of the view askew movies, but it also answers a question what happened to Jay and Silent Bob after the end of Mallrats.  Kudos to Smith and the whole cast.
