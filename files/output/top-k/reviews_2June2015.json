At the same time, they must defend themselves against an all-out attack from the Decepticons.Yeah, I grew up in the 1980s. I recall the Transformers before Michael bay got his grubby little hands on them. Sure, I was more into Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, He-Man and the Ghost Busters, but I knew the Transformers... especially the big names (like Bumblebee).These were great cartoons and a great time for them. No computer animation, nothing fancy, just great artwork and a story. For some reason this film also has rocking music (and a Weird Al song called Dare to be Stupid that makes no sense in the movie or anywhere else).
