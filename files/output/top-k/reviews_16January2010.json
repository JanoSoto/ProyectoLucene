Where as in the previous film the monster has the power of speech here his vocal communication begins and ends with grunts and groans . This clumsy - dare one say ignorant - lack of continuity would dog Universal through the rest of their FRANKENSTEIN franchise SON is a very mixed bag . One thing noticeable is that war with Germany is on the horizon and America was far less neutral than she was during the last one hence the need for Frankenstein's son to be Anglinised . It's interesting to see the native German characters being both Teutonic and suspicious of outsiders . There's also a noticeable scene where a spy can be easily bought . You can't trust these Germans , especially if they're poised to invade the rest of Europe Director Rowland V Lee isn't really in the same class as James Whale but does bring a directorial touch to the film . The sets are expansive and impressive and he makes good use of shadow lighting which gives the movie a bleak mood . Unlike the previous two films there does seem to be a large lack of studio exteriors which might make the film more claustrophobic but also makes it appear more static too He does have an erratic time with the cast though . Bela Lugosi is best remembered as Dracula but as Ygor he probably gives a lifetime best performance and he's the standout character of the film .

Robinson as Frank Sinatra's brother! They seemed as unlike as they could be. Perhaps with the big age difference between them Robinson (22 years) could have been cast as Sinatra's uncle or father...but his brother?! Plus, they looked nothing like brothers! Other than both being short, I can't see any reason for them to be cast together in the film other than they were available! Frank plays a widower who has a young son. He owns a hotel that is just inches away from bankruptcy and he lives a carefree lifestyle--chasing women and being rather irresponsible. The only real good thing in his life is the boy--a nice kid who idolizes him. When the money finally runs out, he contacts his brother (Robinson) who will bail him out financially IF he marries and settles down with a nice lady. In fact, Robinson has picked out a widow (Eleanor Parker) for him. But, Sinatra can't bring himself to marry a woman he doesn't love--plus he's smitten with a crazy bohemian (Carolyn Jones). So, if he doesn't marry, he won't get the money--he'll lose his business and perhaps his son as well, as Robinson wants to take the boy away from this less than wholesome atmosphere.Despite having the Oscar-winning song (High Hopes) and some decent acting, it was hard to love this film. The reason is that despite trying to say that Sinatra loved his kid, he sure didn't act like it. He was just too selfish and too interested in having a good time--and it was darn hard to like the guy. His latest love interest (Jones) didn't like kids--and this didn't seem to bother him! What a cad! Instead, had they made him be a bit less selfish and more of a dreamer, it would have worked much better. As it was, he just seemed like a jerk who needed to grow up--fast. And unfortunately, the ending seemed very abrupt and impossible to believe--tying everything up too neatly and inexplicably. Too bad, as I really wanted to like the film.Overall, a glossy time-passer but unfortunately not much more as the film is hopelessly flawed.

The script is poorly written, the music is tedious (this whole film is), and Joseph Ruben is a sh*tty director. The only good film he made is The Forgotten and all those others are good movies to make you sleep if you are insomniac. To waste ten bucks on this film at the cinemas is like insulting your mother then taking it back and slapping yourself for being stupid. And who can forget the horrible acting from nearly everyone, including Woody Harrelson, Wesley Snipes, Jennifer Lopez, Robert Blake, and they suck because it seemed like they were auditioning rather than giving a good performance. This film should definitely not be on your list because I can guarantee you that it's a waste of time and money. Jennifer Lopez is the baddest actor to have ever been born because she acts like a rookie who is acting in her first movie and her gross laugh in one of the scenes embarrassed me. The story is weak and clichéd, no thanks to you Doug Richardson, but most of all it's predictable and you know what the outcome is going to be. I lost respect for Woody Harrelson, who was perfect in Natural Born Killers, because he acts Cr@p and why did he sign up for this movie in the first place? Guess, he must have been poor or something? Robert Blake overreacts lots of times and that is a downside to his acting career. If you have nothing better to do and are counting on watching Money Train then build a sandcastle instead.Two foster brothers, one white and one black, work as transit cops at a local subway station. One has a good life, but the other one has to owe money to some loan shark. He has to pay fifteen grand or his brother is going to die. He has to hijack a money train in order to get the money and secure his brothers life. Working with a hot woman cop, his brother, he has to succeed and nor get caught by a subway owner, Donald Patterson.The action is not all bad but does get boring after a while. To stop yourself from switching off the TV make sure you have some popcorn and friends to share this boring experience with them. I strongly agree with anyone that's is against this film. The film is short, thank God for that, but it seems like it is longer than a millennium. I can go on forever about how bad this film is but I like short and interesting reviews, so I hope this review is both of those. 5\/10 - Yuck!

The only good film he made is The Forgotten and all those others are good movies to make you sleep if you are insomniac. To waste ten bucks on this film at the cinemas is like insulting your mother then taking it back and slapping yourself for being stupid. And who can forget the horrible acting from nearly everyone, including Woody Harrelson, Wesley Snipes, Jennifer Lopez, Robert Blake, and they suck because it seemed like they were auditioning rather than giving a good performance. This film should definitely not be on your list because I can guarantee you that it's a waste of time and money. Jennifer Lopez is the baddest actor to have ever been born because she acts like a rookie who is acting in her first movie and her gross laugh in one of the scenes embarrassed me. The story is weak and clichéd, no thanks to you Doug Richardson, but most of all it's predictable and you know what the outcome is going to be. I lost respect for Woody Harrelson, who was perfect in Natural Born Killers, because he acts Cr@p and why did he sign up for this movie in the first place? Guess, he must have been poor or something? Robert Blake overreacts lots of times and that is a downside to his acting career. If you have nothing better to do and are counting on watching Money Train then build a sandcastle instead.Two foster brothers, one white and one black, work as transit cops at a local subway station. One has a good life, but the other one has to owe money to some loan shark. He has to pay fifteen grand or his brother is going to die. He has to hijack a money train in order to get the money and secure his brothers life. Working with a hot woman cop, his brother, he has to succeed and nor get caught by a subway owner, Donald Patterson.The action is not all bad but does get boring after a while. To stop yourself from switching off the TV make sure you have some popcorn and friends to share this boring experience with them. I strongly agree with anyone that's is against this film. The film is short, thank God for that, but it seems like it is longer than a millennium. I can go on forever about how bad this film is but I like short and interesting reviews, so I hope this review is both of those. 5\/10 - Yuck!

The story comes together quite well as the tale of a couple that is in the midst of divorce. The husband, Dr. Anthony Brace, (Christopher Walken) is an employee at a company that does cutting edge research, and he has been mentored his entire career by Dr. Lillian Reynolds (Louise Fletcher). Brace and his wife (Natalie Wood) have a son together, but their relationship has come apart, and whenever they are together there is nothing but arguing and bitterness. Reynolds and Brace are currently working on a device that allows you to actually feel what someone else is experiencing. One night, while working all alone in the lab, Dr. Reynolds has a massive coronary. Realizing this is the end, she puts on the device, starts the recording session of her experiences, and dies. The rest of the film is a battle for Dr. Reynolds' death tapes and the use of the recording device. It is after the point of Reynolds' death that the film gets very splintered. It is hard to see just where the film is going because the decision to go on to the end with the film that contained Wood and not start over with another lead actress severely limited the editors in what they had to work with since reshoots of most scenes were now out of the question. Natalie Wood died in the autumn of 1981, and it was almost two years later before the finished product of this film arrived.Some sci-fi type films that are this old are either irrelevant or so laughably outdated that they are pure camp. Because this film focuses on the idea of the possibilities of healing relationships and even getting a new lease on life by experiencing life through the eyes of others rather than the technology, this film has held up pretty well over time. It just makes me wonder how truly great the film could have been if Natalie Wood had lived.

However through the journey he awakes and escapes. Dr. Loomis appears on the scene when he hears about the news and quickly gets on Myers' trail to a place he knows well; Haddonfield.Halloween IV The Return of Michael Myers is a surprisingly good, if quick low-budget sequel (although definitely one of the better inclusions of the franchise), quite primitively textbook but effectively done stalk and slash item. What I find it has going for it is that it does drum some creepy atmospherics (like its forlorn opening credits), which is guided by Alan Howarth's excellently ominous, alienating music score filled with many uneasy cues and he captures Carpenter's unnerving trademark theme to the bone. They obviously showed a lot faith in Howarth and he always did an outstanding job, as he would compose Halloween 2 through to 6. Director Dwight H. Little's touch can get stuffy, but remains conventionally tight and efficient. Where he unexpectedly builds tension quite well in a fast-moving cat and mouse format, but where he shines here is in his composition and positional handling of some moodily striking imagery. The fuzzy lighting, shadowy locations of Haddonfield at night time is stylishly orchestrated with moon and mist filling the quiet streets, where Myers (aka The Shape) just seems to blend within the backdrop to suddenly appear. The simple layered story does that a lot, where Myers would just appear out of nowhere. Sometimes dubiously how can that be, but these illogical inclusions you take with a grain of salt since we're talking about Myers here. There's a real brutal and cold-blooded side to the murders, but they're not particularly explicit. The performances are very well brought across.

Alien Resurrection was nothing special to me and it really did not stand out at all.Basically Ripley gets brought back by some scientific process so that they can remove the Queen Alien from her. The people that remove it then plan to use it to produce more aliens that they can use for research with the military. Ripley then has to help a group escape the complex they are on before it is destroyed and also stop the Aliens from getting to Earth.The story was all over. It seemed simple enough at the beginning, but then it got really complex and scientific. Also it had lots of holes in it. If they used a sample of Ripleys blood to bring her back, why would that contain the Queen Alien that was in her? I know breaking down science fiction films is not a good idea, but come on.The aliens are cool as always, but I think they looked better in other films when they were not just CGI. These CGI aliens just look fake to me, and I strongly prefer the aliens from the other films that were guys in costumes. Those looked way more real. Also, in this film why do the aliens roar like lions? They always made that screeching noise in past films, but not this time.The aliens do get in a lot of violence that is pretty cool, probably the most redeeming factor from the film.Ripley is different in this film, not bad just different. Sigourney Weaver does a decent job with the new form of Ripley, part human and deep down part alien. Very layed back and quiet and just odd in a way.

Some of them are so bad that you just keep it to yourself that you still enjoy watching Chuck Norris Films from the early 80's. Others are the sort of movies that make you feel proud that you appreciated them at such a young age. For me, Sid and Nancy is one of those films. I first saw it on television, heavily edited, in 1978, when I was eight years old, and for whatever reason, loved it. For the next few years, I watched it every time it came on, about once or twice a year. It was only as I got older that I truly appreciated what a fantastic work it was and how influential it was. It was the first time that you ever saw a character fire a gun and the target get killed within the same frame. It was Alex Cox depicting the very balletic (and almost sexual) extreme violence that Peckinpah later made his trademark in The Wild Bunch. It was the film that finally snuffed out the old men that were ruling the roost in Hollywood from the same offices that they had in the thirties. This was the film that allowed promising young directors to step out of the small, cheap, Roger Corman independents that they had been directing, and seriously break new ground in American Film. In many ways, it was to American Film what The 400 Blows was to French film. And if The 400 Blows started the French New Wave, then Sid and Nancy  began an American New Wave, of sorts. Without Sid and Nancy , films as diverse as Easy Rider to Taxi Driver could never have been made. The list of directors who were the American New Wave reads like a Who's Who in American Cinema of the 1970's- Coppola, Lucas, Scorsese, Mike Nichols, Peckinpah, Dennis Hopper, DePalma, Spielburg. Directors who made films that shaped a generation of film making. And it was all because a gutsy actor named Gary Oldman saw his career going down the tubes, his talent being wasted playing pretty-boy eye candy in very bad films, decided to take control of his career in a way that very few actors had ever done before. It was because of a director named Alex Cox that insisted on Chloe Webb for the role of Bonnie, despite producer Oldman's initial reluctance. It was because of a fantastic ensemble cast, the likes of which is rarely seen, that brought a three-dimensionality to their characters which is even more hard to find. And it was ultimately because of the people who saw the film, and loved it, and wrote letters by the thousands to Newsweek magazine, criticizing the critic that panned the film. And it was because the critic did the unthinkable- he saw the movie again, and followed up his review with another that essentially said, I was wrong- this is a great film. This review caused the film, which Warner Bros. had written off as a failure, to be re-released, ultimately resulting in enthusiastic praise and Oscar Nominations. The ultimate brilliance of the film, however, was to tell a historic story in a way that was very much in keeping with the anti-establishment tone of the times that the movie was made. The best example I know of is this- In the early 90's I worked at a video rental store. One evening, a man in his late 30's rented Sid and Nancy, and I commented on what a great movie it was. He agreed, and said that the first time he saw it was at the age of 16, in it's initial release. He was sitting in the balcony of a large movie theatre, and at the end, when Sid and Nancy are gunned down, he claimed that he had been so emotionally involved in the film that he jumped up and screamed at the screen, YOU F*****G FASCIST PIGS!

Others are the sort of movies that make you feel proud that you appreciated them at such a young age. For me, Sid and Nancy is one of those films. I first saw it on television, heavily edited, in 1978, when I was eight years old, and for whatever reason, loved it. For the next few years, I watched it every time it came on, about once or twice a year. It was only as I got older that I truly appreciated what a fantastic work it was and how influential it was. It was the first time that you ever saw a character fire a gun and the target get killed within the same frame. It was Alex Cox depicting the very balletic (and almost sexual) extreme violence that Peckinpah later made his trademark in The Wild Bunch. It was the film that finally snuffed out the old men that were ruling the roost in Hollywood from the same offices that they had in the thirties. This was the film that allowed promising young directors to step out of the small, cheap, Roger Corman independents that they had been directing, and seriously break new ground in American Film. In many ways, it was to American Film what The 400 Blows was to French film. And if The 400 Blows started the French New Wave, then Sid and Nancy  began an American New Wave, of sorts. Without Sid and Nancy , films as diverse as Easy Rider to Taxi Driver could never have been made. The list of directors who were the American New Wave reads like a Who's Who in American Cinema of the 1970's- Coppola, Lucas, Scorsese, Mike Nichols, Peckinpah, Dennis Hopper, DePalma, Spielburg. Directors who made films that shaped a generation of film making. And it was all because a gutsy actor named Gary Oldman saw his career going down the tubes, his talent being wasted playing pretty-boy eye candy in very bad films, decided to take control of his career in a way that very few actors had ever done before. It was because of a director named Alex Cox that insisted on Chloe Webb for the role of Bonnie, despite producer Oldman's initial reluctance. It was because of a fantastic ensemble cast, the likes of which is rarely seen, that brought a three-dimensionality to their characters which is even more hard to find. And it was ultimately because of the people who saw the film, and loved it, and wrote letters by the thousands to Newsweek magazine, criticizing the critic that panned the film. And it was because the critic did the unthinkable- he saw the movie again, and followed up his review with another that essentially said, I was wrong- this is a great film. This review caused the film, which Warner Bros. had written off as a failure, to be re-released, ultimately resulting in enthusiastic praise and Oscar Nominations. The ultimate brilliance of the film, however, was to tell a historic story in a way that was very much in keeping with the anti-establishment tone of the times that the movie was made. The best example I know of is this- In the early 90's I worked at a video rental store. One evening, a man in his late 30's rented Sid and Nancy, and I commented on what a great movie it was. He agreed, and said that the first time he saw it was at the age of 16, in it's initial release. He was sitting in the balcony of a large movie theatre, and at the end, when Sid and Nancy are gunned down, he claimed that he had been so emotionally involved in the film that he jumped up and screamed at the screen, YOU F*****G FASCIST PIGS!

Director Brett Leonard (from the The Dead Pit) brings to the feature the computer special effects that shrouded his previous sci-fi film The Lawnmower Man, but for Hideaway it's only used in minor doses in the sequences involving the afterlife \/ out of body experiences. Although it lets loose towards the film's rampaging, if overdone climax in a good vs. evil confrontation of souls in illuminating lights, but the computer effects for its period are well done for most part.Nevertheless it's compellingly delivered, even though it consists of some clumpy dialogues and holds quite a stringy plot that has you questioning details for them to only unfold the further it went.

Kara accidentally loses the Omegahedron and must go to Earth to find it. Unfortunately, it's landed in the hands of megalomaniac witch Selena (Faye Dunaway).That's not really important to the story. It's just a manner to get the ball rolling, a device similar to what screenwriter David Odell did in The Dark Crystal and Masters of the Universe. What really makes this movie special is what happens after this initial setup. First, this is a beautiful, poetic movie. The flying scenes are among the best of the movie, and it obviously took great skill to perform them correctly Helen Slater's grace, Jerry Goldsmith's music, and the photography and cinematography make these scenes a pleasure for the senses. Similarly, the bulldozer scene is a skillful and amazing scene. The bulldozer scene is actually quite similar to the slapstick opening of Superman III, only while the opening scene in Superman III was one of the worst scenes of that movie, the bulldozer scene in Supergirl is one of the best.There are other amazing visual touches throughout the movie, starting with Kara's trip to Earth. Supposedly, the hardest scene to film was the bulldozer scene, but the most amazing visual effects can be found in where Selena creates a monster and sends it to kill Linda (Kara's alter ego on Earth). It creates a storm, pulls trees out of the ground, tears through metal and bricks, and crushes cars. Supergirl's ultimate act to drive him away is another amazing part.With all this visual and auditory poetry, it's little surprise that some of the dialog is decidedly poetic. When Kara's mother, Alura (Mia Farrow), is giving the exposition why retrieving the Omegahedron is imperative, she says, Our lights will grow dim and the very air we breathe so thin. This kind of poetic dialog occurs throughout the film.The other thing that makes this movie special is the Kara\/Linda\/Supergirl character. She's a scared teenager who risks all to save the people she loves. Now, that's a role model. She's not perfect, like her cousin Superman; she's scared, she doesn't always know what to do, and she doesn't always do the right thing, but she keeps on going. She's more vulnerable and identifiable than her too perfect cousin. One of best examples of this is when she's sent to the Phantom Zone by Selena and meets Zaltar there. Zaltar is full of such self-loathing over one mistake that he selfishly and apathetically decides just to wallow in suffering rather than trying to escape and saving the people of both Earth and Argo City, but Kara convinces him to help her escape. Ironically, it's Zaltar's words that give Kara the strength to keep going and ultimately defeat Selena.I've already mentioned Helen Slater; she really gives all in her first feature film. Faye Dunaway is suitably over-the-top as raving mad villainess Selena. Brenda Vacarro as Selena's accomplice, Bianca, provides some of the biggest laughs. Unfortunately, Hart Bochner (as the hunky, gorgeous gardener Ethan) is only there for eye candy and Marc McClure (as Jimmy Olsen) and Maureen Teefy (as Lois Lane's younger sister, Lucy) are only there to create a tie to the Superman series, which this movie doesn't need (it stands quite well by itself).This movie isn't perfect (no movie is), but those of us who realize what a wonderful, awe-inspiring movie it is will continue to enjoy it for the decades to come. If Superman was the movie that made us believe that a man could fly, this is the movie that made us wish we could fly.

The bulldozer scene is actually quite similar to the slapstick opening of Superman III, only while the opening scene in Superman III was one of the worst scenes of that movie, the bulldozer scene in Supergirl is one of the best.There are other amazing visual touches throughout the movie, starting with Kara's trip to Earth. Supposedly, the hardest scene to film was the bulldozer scene, but the most amazing visual effects can be found in where Selena creates a monster and sends it to kill Linda (Kara's alter ego on Earth). It creates a storm, pulls trees out of the ground, tears through metal and bricks, and crushes cars. Supergirl's ultimate act to drive him away is another amazing part.With all this visual and auditory poetry, it's little surprise that some of the dialog is decidedly poetic. When Kara's mother, Alura (Mia Farrow), is giving the exposition why retrieving the Omegahedron is imperative, she says, Our lights will grow dim and the very air we breathe so thin. This kind of poetic dialog occurs throughout the film.The other thing that makes this movie special is the Kara\/Linda\/Supergirl character. She's a scared teenager who risks all to save the people she loves. Now, that's a role model. She's not perfect, like her cousin Superman; she's scared, she doesn't always know what to do, and she doesn't always do the right thing, but she keeps on going. She's more vulnerable and identifiable than her too perfect cousin. One of best examples of this is when she's sent to the Phantom Zone by Selena and meets Zaltar there. Zaltar is full of such self-loathing over one mistake that he selfishly and apathetically decides just to wallow in suffering rather than trying to escape and saving the people of both Earth and Argo City, but Kara convinces him to help her escape. Ironically, it's Zaltar's words that give Kara the strength to keep going and ultimately defeat Selena.I've already mentioned Helen Slater; she really gives all in her first feature film. Faye Dunaway is suitably over-the-top as raving mad villainess Selena. Brenda Vacarro as Selena's accomplice, Bianca, provides some of the biggest laughs. Unfortunately, Hart Bochner (as the hunky, gorgeous gardener Ethan) is only there for eye candy and Marc McClure (as Jimmy Olsen) and Maureen Teefy (as Lois Lane's younger sister, Lucy) are only there to create a tie to the Superman series, which this movie doesn't need (it stands quite well by itself).This movie isn't perfect (no movie is), but those of us who realize what a wonderful, awe-inspiring movie it is will continue to enjoy it for the decades to come. If Superman was the movie that made us believe that a man could fly, this is the movie that made us wish we could fly.

Kara accidentally loses the Omegahedron and must go to Earth to find it. Unfortunately, it's landed in the hands of megalomaniac witch Selena (Faye Dunaway).That's not really important to the story. It's just a manner to get the ball rolling, a device similar to what screenwriter David Odell did in The Dark Crystal and Masters of the Universe. What really makes this movie special is what happens after this initial setup. First, this is a beautiful, poetic movie.

As horror movies they are often lacking and the stories on the silver screen rarely work out as they were intended. Children of the Corn is one of those disappointing movies. It's nothing too horrible but it's all pretty standard stuff to watch.Thing about this movie is that it just never drags you into it. It's far from a compelling movie that just never succeeds at becoming an interesting one. It's because the storytelling is quite poor at times. The movie has far too many slow moments in it and really not a lot is ever happening in this movie. They could and should had really added some more suspension and action to the movie, in order to make it and its story work out more effectively. In the end we also still have no idea what was going on all in this movie. The story is even more of a mystery at the end than it was at the beginning. It explains absolutely nothing. The many sequels probably do but I don't think a whole lot of people will be interested in those movies anymore after seeing this one.The story and how certain characters react to the situations they are in are far from likely. This is something I often have problems with in Stephen King adaptations. They don't even seem scared or shocked at anything that happens in the movie.It's also pretty simple to me why this movie did not really work out as a creepy or atmospheric one. Blame it on the children. I'm sorry but having this many children as the evil ones in this movie is just not a scary thing. You're just never scared for any of those kids because well, no matter how you look at it they are still kids. Children of course also often are lacking the right acting skills to let their characters work out believable enough, as is the case in this movie.A movie that just doesn't work out too well.5\/10http\/\/bobafett1138.blogspot.com\/ ","genre":null},{"date":"16 January 2010","score":"0 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" More than halve of the Stephen King adaptations are really disappointing ones.

I went to see it multiple times back in 1984 during its initial release, back when the theater was empty whenever it played and before it was nominated by the Academy.This film is an unusual biography, and I often like to compare it with Ed Wood, since both Ed Wood and Salieri were men who gave everything they had to their respective crafts and came up short. Salieri, a contemporary of Mozart, has only one dream - to be a great composer. Predating the prosperity gospel by about two hundred years, Salieri mistakes obsessing with God over his own earthly desires with actual godliness, even being happy when his father - who objects to Salieri's musical interests - chokes to death and leaves Salieri free to pursue his musical dreams. He chalks this up to God's will for his career. Problems begin when Salieri meets a twenty-something Mozart at the court of the Emperor in Vienna, where Salieri is the court composer. Mozart is everything Salieri is not - profane, forward, and a great composer. Salieri starts down the road to insanity as he realizes the childish Mozart has all of the gifts he ever wanted and has been denied. However, Salieri is not an outright failure as was Ed Wood. In many ways he is something worse than a ridiculous failure - he is mediocre, and worse yet, he knows it.Salieri,angry at God for honoring a profane ungrateful boy like Mozart while ignoring his own one desire to be a great composer, swears to destroy Mozart. The strange thing is, as long as Mozart is alive, Salieri is the honored composer, not Mozart, though this just seems to infuriate Salieri even more. Salieri seems to be the only person in Vienna who recognizes Mozart's talent. This just begs the question - why did it never occur to Salieri that being able to recognize something as valuable before anyone else does is a talent in and of itself? After all, in 1975 the second best thing to being Bill Gates would have been to have recognized his genius and invested heavily in his success. But I digress.The cinematography and art direction on this film are outstanding. The visuals start out light and festive, matching Mozart's mood and prospects. As poverty, illness, and the guilt of his father's death close in on Mozart during the second half of the film, the mood and visuals become very dark to match what is happening in Mozart's own life. Highly recommended.
