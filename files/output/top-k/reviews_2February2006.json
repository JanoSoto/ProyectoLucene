From the dreamy beginning of this bland final chapter, until the ending cliché moments, there were probably a million different themes and elements that were utterly pathetic. In fact, I believe that this may be the first film that I have watched which had no redeeming values surrounding it. For any of you that have watched, like myself, the House Party trilogy, there is a level of expectation that follows these films. The first movie set the groundwork. Kid & Play need to get to a party and express themselves lyrically. The sequel finished the shabby generic walls of the house by repeating a similar diagram, while the third film was the demolition team to tear it down. Everything set up from the beginning of this series was destroyed, demolished, decayed, disemboweled by the time that the third installment arrived. We were missing key characters, Kid & Play seemed less excited by this film, and apparently continuity from the second film was not a top priority for director Eric Meza. This film is nothing but trash left in the house for too long. House Party 3 smells, it is attracting too many flies, and mold is the only form of life willing to adapt to it. Sad to see the potentials of a trilogy die because the final film didn't pay respect to its beginnings.I would like to say that the acting was to blame for such a disappointing ending, but that means I would have to admit to there actually being acting in this film. That is something I am not willing to acknowledge at this time. As our story developed, you could easily see the relief behind Kid & Play's eyes knowing that this was going to be their final jaunt in the House Party line. In fact, you could see the excitement melt away from their characters as the film progressed. It was a headache to watch. Kid was not his typical expression-esquire self, but instead, older and more tired? Play was just annoying in this film. Meza decided to completely disregard their passions in the first two films and make them managers instead of performers in this final one. This is what hurt the most, to witness two characters that we have seen grow over time from young idealistic teens ready to lyrically express themselves and go to parties, to old, tired, and boring actors caring less about the music, more about the money, and have the lamest parties imaginable. I thought I would never find myself saying this, but I missed Pops from the original. I didn't miss him in the second film, but now seeing this final chapter I missed some of the old faces. This may be the only time you hear me say this, but I missed Martin Lawrence. While I hated his character in the first two films, he was an element missing House Party 3. They tried to cover this by employing Bernie Mac as the annoying Uncle, but it just didn't seem to work. Screaming is not a substitute for acting. Chris Tucker makes a small cameo, and honestly, I could have used more of him. He was a shining bit of light in this dark, damp, disgusting film.As you read this review, you may find yourself saying, Andy, you hated the other two films, what made you think this would be any different? I don't think I was hoping for Oscar nominations, but I did want a strong finale to this trilogy. I worked my way through it, I felt I deserved it. I wanted to see familiar faces, as much as I hated them, I wanted to see a familiar plot (however generic and repetitive it was to be), and I wanted to see a union between two familiar characters, instead of throwing in a random stranger at the end. I feel as if these are very reasonable requests considering nothing lead me to believe this film would end up to be the tragedy it was. After watching this film, no matter how bad it was going to be, I wanted to be able to flip through the channels on TV and see House Party on TBS and find myself reminiscing of the future that I knew. Now, that is never going to happen. If there is one trilogy that I want to put behind me, it is the House Party films. For nearly an hour and a half, we watch unmotivated characters force themselves through cliché urban hip-hop cinema motions. Where were the bad guys? Where were the familiarities of the original films? I hated the first films, but I detested House Party 3. Why bother building a fan base if you are just going to tear it down with the finale. It is somewhat like changing characters midway through a television series. It just doesn't work, and it didn't work in this film.Overall, this movie was a disaster. While the other two films were never much to write home about, I did want a conclusion. I wanted to finish this series without worrying that there may be more coming around the bend. That was, before I noticed House Party 4 as another sequel. This series should have ended after the first one. House Party is a classic example of what happens when Hollywood notices that small budget films can continue to make money even after they loose their appeal. Take a look at Scary Movie 4 being released soon. Honestly, is it necessary? I do not suggest this film or this entire series. The first one, if you are forced to watch, than watch. Otherwise, don't waste your brain space!

She knows she may die, and would have been safe on the lifeboat, but she doesn't care.

From time to time-although,sadly,increasingly rarely as the years pass-I see groups of elderly men,often wearing windcheaters or old flying jackets,walking slowly but determinedly past King's College towards The Eagle,a town centre pub much favoured by aircrew during World War 2.These men,of an age group so often the target for disrespect and abuse in this country,are the rapidly dwindling survivors of the Mighty Eighth.Their tormentors neither know nor care that if it was not for them and many others like them they would in all probability be speaking German or Russian,depending on which of those two former allies ended up lording it over Europe.The English language would certainly have been verboten or speaking it a Niet - niet. After Pearl Harbour very few young Americans felt the European War had much to do with them.It had already been going on for over two years and Europe was notoriously unstable even in peacetime.The Pacific War,now that was a matter of national pride,why not let the English take care of the Nazis?But still these brave men set off for a cold damp impoverished country half a world away and flew across some of the most heavily-defended parts of Europe in broad daylight,a task the RAF had found far too dangerous day after day,suffering huge losses to be swindled in shops and laughed at in the country pubs.Their story deserves to be told and in Twelve o'clock high it is told magnificently. Nobody goes out and shoots down 6 Messerschmidts before breakfast,there are no idiots flying their planes under bridges,silk scarves trailing in the slipstream,bombing was a dirty,dangerous business and the men who flew the bombers were deadly serious about their business. With frightening casualty rates it was essential to maintain morale at the airbases,get the reputation as an Unlucky squadron and it could easily become a self-fulfilling prophecy. The responsibility for improving and maintaining morale rested on the shoulders of the C.O.In this case General Savage(Mr Gregory Peck).

Surely enough the unequipped police station is soon under siege by huge masses of street gang members and this is when the small handful of police must join forces with the few convicts to defend themselves from these continuous waves of attacks in one huge stand for survival.After hearing how great this flick is for so long and that they're never make these types of flicks again, I finally gotta around to seeing this highly regarded if slightly under the radar Carpenters' b-grade exploitation flick. And yep, it lived up to the hype quite impressively. I would actually hold it right up there with 'The Thing' that's for sure! Whenever somebody hears the name John Carpenter, most likely 'Halloween' or 'The Thing' pops in mind, but sadly this one seems to be an overlooked gem, although definitely not for those who get a kick out of his work. Especially from his earlier stuff, before he started his decline in the late 80's. After the very odd 'Dark Star, 'John Carpenters' second feature film was the stunner Assault on Precinct 13 (1976). What Carpenter had to work with was next to nothing, but hell he came up with an exciting, on-the-edge action-thriller that never lets up. You can only do with what you got and Carpenter makes the most of it here. The film's story is primly primitive and wears its influences on its sleeve. It could've turned out to be an satire really, but he steers clear away from it and delivers the action, suspense and dry humour in a nice balance. With those things only on mind. You can also see Carpenter's love for the western genre here by setting a traditional western in a modern environment, and Howard Hawks' 'Rio Bravo' is definitely a blueprint for it, but also a horror classic comes to mind and that's Romero's 'Night of the Living Dead'. The fruitful similarities are priceless, but don't think that it's a knock off that lacks ideas. The plot is hardly bullet proof with some holes appearing and silly situations occurring, but what really sets the film apart from the basic story is that of Carpenter's lively and articulated direction. He builds a real desperation and claustrophobic feel that really tightens up with such full throttle pacing and explosively raw action. All of this gets the juices pumping and hits you like a tonne of bricks. That really goes for the advancing synthesiser score that gets you really worked up and unrelentingly pays off. A great composed piece by Carpenter and I say it tops the 'Halloween' theme&#133; gasp. It also doesn't hold back on the brutal violence and there's one shocking scene that sticks in your head soon after the flick has finished. Backing all this up is the fast-cutting camera work and kinetic editing that makes the movie's pace swiftly taut, but fly right by without bump. The sound effects have huge impact too with the hissing gunshots adding to the intensity that bellows from out of the speakers and screen. One of the films weaknesses would be the performances, they're rather stiff, but it didn't seem to bother me at all. That's because there were some charming if memorizing characters like Austin Stoker as the hard eyed police officer Ethan Bishop and Darwin Joston as the wisecracking jailbird Napoleon Wilson. The rest were pretty uneventful. Though Nancy Loomis and Charles Cyphers have small roles too. The acting might not be that of high standards, but they seem to work off each other rather neatly and click together, after the clashing personalities to begin with. The tight script is incredibly tense and it throws in enough revelations and sharp and tough dialog. You can call it a stretch at times, but Carpenter who wrote, composed and directed this shoestring picture with enough style and brute that tests the boundaries for its time. By today's standards it has dated considerably, but the finished product and results we get are plain hard to knock and the films' goals are fulfilling.In the ever-increasing remakes flooding Hollywood today it was no surprise that this flick got a reworking. Sure it doesn't match the impact of the original, but the remake has enough surprises of its own and makes for an entertaining watch nonetheless. I wasn't really that interested in it in the first place, but my friend made me change my mind from seeing 'The Ring Two'. Phew, that was a close one! For such a simple plot and miniature budget it packs enough wallop then that of most action movies who have a budget twice the size!

That's because there were some charming if memorizing characters like Austin Stoker as the hard eyed police officer Ethan Bishop and Darwin Joston as the wisecracking jailbird Napoleon Wilson. The rest were pretty uneventful. Though Nancy Loomis and Charles Cyphers have small roles too. The acting might not be that of high standards, but they seem to work off each other rather neatly and click together, after the clashing personalities to begin with. The tight script is incredibly tense and it throws in enough revelations and sharp and tough dialog. You can call it a stretch at times, but Carpenter who wrote, composed and directed this shoestring picture with enough style and brute that tests the boundaries for its time. By today's standards it has dated considerably, but the finished product and results we get are plain hard to knock and the films' goals are fulfilling.In the ever-increasing remakes flooding Hollywood today it was no surprise that this flick got a reworking. Sure it doesn't match the impact of the original, but the remake has enough surprises of its own and makes for an entertaining watch nonetheless. I wasn't really that interested in it in the first place, but my friend made me change my mind from seeing 'The Ring Two'. Phew, that was a close one! For such a simple plot and miniature budget it packs enough wallop then that of most action movies who have a budget twice the size! For me it's exceptional film making that truly lives up to its rep.

It's true that the movie does contain scenes from both books, but that's not so bad.

Then it is reformed into a New York stage show (more real) and similarly gets out of control. There are other folds involved, but this is why he came to the project and how he saw it.Heavenly Creatures is about an obsessive relationship that switches between the reality of the characters in the movie and a sort of fantasy movieworld populated by Orson Welles figures (made of clay). All of his movies have similar folds, and so does this one.This is a show about a guy who puts on a show with collaborative ghosts. He somehow gets the control of the larger ghostworld tied up in this so the inner show gets out of control. See how similar this is to King King?

The direction is flawed in a very similar way, but he at least has some idea of where to put the camera and the actors. The Art Direction is amazing as is the score but now I will get to the really good part of the movie. The performances. William Hurt is one of the greatest actors to live and although this is not his greatest performance it is very, very close and still truly amazing. Marlee Matlin is also amazing as the deaf woman he falls in love with. Her character is disabled in tow big ways. Being deaf of course but also the worse of the two.

There was such turmoil, violence and uncertainty in the air. This movie serves as a barometer to the threatening mood. Wyatt (Wyatt Earp) and Billy (Billy the Kid) are two self-adorned modern cowboys. The scene in which they need to pull over and fix a wheel is paralleled by the two gentlemen applying a horse shoe to one of their horses while Billy and Wyatt are attaching a new wheel to their bike. Instead of their trusty steeds, they live a life of loneliness and seclusion on the open road as they take their motorcycles on a journey from Los Angeles to Louisiana with more than a few encounters in between. It is an attempt to recapture the old west. However, as is the theme of almost all of the westerns of moving east to west, the theme in Easy Rider is a migration from west to east.The journey they set off take is sparked by a drug transaction they had just completed and are now on their way to live a life of simplicity in the Florida orange groves. While en route to this idealized utopia, they also take in what the great country of America has to offer them. However, as they get deeper and deeper into unfamiliar territory, the idea of America is getting farther and farther away. The first few scenes of the movie are majestic panoramas of the beautiful south west of America with awe inspiring sunsets. When picking up a hitch hiker, they happen upon a self sustaining commune is which the inhabitants live a simple and joyous. Billy, the hot headed high tempered friend of Wyatt (also known as captain America) has a bad experience and wants to leave, which sparks Wyatt's reluctant departure. This is where their idea of America begins to deteriorate.They continue on and get deeper and deeper into the south. When joining a parade they see that life is not as easy going down in that part of country and realize that their kind of people is even less welcome. They are put in jail where they meet George (jack Nicholson). George is somewhat of an innocent alcoholic. He asks to see their amazing machines, referring to their motorcycles, and barely knows that marijuana exists. The men form a bond and soon roll into a back country town where they and their ideals are not readily accepted. The locals, played by actual people rather actors, immediately begin to toss slurs at them and judge them by the way they are dressed and there is a constant attack, silly as it seems now, on their haircuts. They start to get the idea that this United States is far different from what they believed it to be. After being verbally coerced into leaving the men set up camp and are attacked by the anti hippie generation because of their fear, as George puts it, of what they represent to them. And the group represents true freedom. I believe this to be the most telling line of the movie as it speaks to what the country was going through in a very delicate time in its maturation.Throughout the rest of the movie, the two protagonists', Wyatt and Bill, moods are changed. They don't what they've gotten themselves into. They reach one of their goals, which is Mardi Gras, but realize that maybe this isn't what they wanted. A well filmed LSD scene is incorporated into the script in which chaos ensues which symbolizes the turmoil of a nation. Upon reaching Florida, Wyatt questions whether this is what they really wanted. Did they really want to see the ugly side that their home had to offer. They would have been better off staying at the hippie commune because in the end, their ideals and life styles catch up with them when two rednecks shoot and kill them only because they didn't like the looks of them. The end of the movie is a haunting image of the disharmony of a country in disarray.

Free-wheeling, adventurous and marauding, these gangs tore up pavement of Southern California (for the most part). The Hells Angels Motorcycle Club was founded in San Bernardino, CA in 1948, but it was not until 1965 that the club erupted into the national spotlight following the allege rape of two young women in Monterey. And with the growing demographic of delinquent youths as movie go-ers, the studios started to cater to their lust for action and lawless-ness. An event in 1947 set the plot for the Marlon Brando film The Wild One (1953, László Benedek) but the movie eventually faded from the lime light. As the '60s got going, the Angels, and other gangs such as The Diablos and The Bandidos and The Gypsy Jokers, started to rev their engines and start to go out into public more often in formation. With their colors flying and their numbers in full swing, the gangs (or clubs) would sweep into a town for a weekend of debauchery and good ol' fashioned fun. The public started to take notice. Hunter S. Thompson, noted Gonzo journalist, went on the road for one year with the Hells Angels and released the book recounting their story, Hell's Angels The strange and terrible saga of the outlaw motorcycle gangs in 1966. '66 also saw the release of The Wild Angels (Roger Corman). California Senators hurriedly put together investigations into these motorcycle clubs (MC) and the findings were published and quoted in newspapers, Newsweek, and even ever skeptical Time. It was clear that the motorcycle gangs were going to be the media sensation of the late 1960s.With the studios paying closer attention to the fragmenting demographics of movie go-ers, films started to cater to this lust for action. And Peter Fonda was right on top of things when it came to making MC films. He starred in The Wild Angels as Heavenly Blues and according to J Hoberman, Fonda cooked up the idea for Easy Rider while smoking dope in his hotel room at 3 am. It dawned on Fonda, allegedly, that the modern cowboy was the motorcycle outlaw. (There is another story explaining the origin of Easy Rider which actually includes a Hells Angel as told by Peter Coyote in his memoir.) (J. Hoberman. The Dream Life. p.191) With the idea revving and some accidental funding, Fonda and a very paranoid Dennis Hopper embarked on relaying the life of the motorcycle outlaw to the drooling public.Although the film was a low-budget exploitation of the lust for MC debauchery in the theatres, it succeeded in capturing some of the essence of the time period. The desire to find a lost freedom in the vast expanses of paved California and across the States was real. The communes and reliance on rice as a food source, hospitality as a way of surviving day to day, and the necessity of drugs were all well known to the youths watching the film premier in '69. Some people, now in their 50s, glance back and the film with a sentimental eye, but realize how cliché some of the devices and characters were. All in all the film was a huge success because it played off a national hype surrounding the outlaw MCs of the period and represented the very real struggle to find America despite America.
