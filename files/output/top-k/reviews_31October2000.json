Of course, it helps if they're planned that way, and usually trilogies are the best example of this. Take Krzysztof Kieslowski's Trois couleurs trio of films, or the unofficial Tarantino trilogy of Dogs, True Romance and Pulp Fiction. Some franchises succeed because they operate in a series of self-contained movies, such as James Bond. Yet extending what is essentially the same story past a third instalment rarely succeeds. And does anyone know of a fifth film in an on-going set that manages to rise above rank? The Final Frontier may be underrated, but Battle for the Planet of the Apes was thoroughly lousy.And so it was a pleasant surprise to find out that The Revenge of Michael Myers is by far the best of all the Halloween sequels. Maybe not the best in terms of quality, but certainly in terms of fun. For it seems that by this stage in the series the production team were starting to realise that the somewhat predictable A to B dynamic of the plot was becoming tired. Basically, Myers comes back to his hometown, kills a few people, gets shot by Donald Pleasence and then disappears ready for the sequel. So for the fifth time round, they threw in everything but the proverbial kitchen sink.Two of the best elements of this sequel are the direction (which is the best, and least mainstream, since the original) and the theme tune, once more toned-down after the funked-up disco anthems that constituted the theme from parts 2 to 4. It's only really in the last half an hour where Myers goes into full killing spree mode, so the main thrust of the film keeps it's shocks going through misnomers. Friends tap each other on the back with a short stab of music, or kittens will jump out unexpectedly. In the midst of all this, since the departure of top screamer Jamie Lee Curtis (her character was killed off between films, which makes it odd that she comes back for the seventh), we get lots of fun-loving, sexed-up teenagers, throwing parties and expressing an urge to go skinny-dipping. It could almost be subtitled Horny High-Jinx. Yet in a series where girls find all manner of reasons to take their top off and fall over, this is the only film in the series (apart from H20) not to feature nudity. This despite the fact that it hints at it, with carefully shot shower scenes and a sex romp where they keep their clothes on. It's also one of only three sequels that reach a 90 minute duration.Perhaps what may detract is that of Danielle Harris (who has somehow learnt to act between this and the previous year's Return) sharing a telepathic link with Uncle Mike. Okay, it is daft, and it does conveniently gloss over the fourth's shock ending, but at this stage of the series Myers has now survived over forty bullets, being hit around the head with rifles, run over by a high-speed truck and a major gas explosion. So having a psychic link with your niece seems quite tame by comparison. Taking this full-on tack to its logical extension, Pleasence's Dr. Loomis is now completely barking. Mind you, it would get you down if you predicted Myers' actions three films running and no one took a blind bit of notice. Then again, Myers doesn't exactly help matters by always attacking on Halloween &#150; couldn't he do it on Shrove Tuesday or something, just to vary his schedule?There are some nice moments where Loomis tries to reason with Myers, and he even shows his face (the audience don't get to see it, however) to Jamie. This brings up the question of the rage, which at least tries to give him some motivation. This has always been the major stumbling block of the Halloween films for me; there being no justification for Myer's actions. Okay, so he's killing his sister, in his mind, (And in a Return of the Jedi-style revelation, Curtis turned out to be his literal sister in the second), but the question remains &#150; why did he kill his sister in the first place?This doesn't, of course, match the original Halloween (1978, 6), which was itself still a rather average tale. Other than the honourable Curtis it isn't terribly well acted, and not quite the art house work it's often purported to be. Halloween II (1981, 4) took the somewhat unusual step of opening with a jolly, upbeat rendition of Mr.Sandman, ideal music for a horror film, before taking us through a prologue reprise and into the titles where even the pumpkin looked cuddly. It was a straight retread of the first, though lacked it's skill, and the silly third entry (Season of the Witch, 1982, 3) discarded all references to Myers and came up with it's own pointless story. By all accounts, this temporarily killed off the series, with Halloween 4 The Return of Michael Myers (1988, 4) not emerging until six long years later. This was saddled with the necessary exposition that a franchise resurrecting a seven-year-old storyline would inevitably face. It looked tired, choresome, and was the most mainstream entry of them all.All of which paved the way for a segment that knew Myers was no longer scary and instead opted for randy teens and a comedy police double-act (Fortunately, we're lousy cops!). And even though it does tone down the slasher quotient, when Myers does finally appear, the ending proves to be suitably claustrophobic, and a little unnerving. 5\/10.
