Almost everyone on earth has been captured as a slave to Artificial Intelligence (AI). Everyone lives and works and carries on with life, not even knowing what they experience every day is more of a dream world, similar to living on a planet-sized Star Trek holodeck. While everyone thinks they are living in the real world, reality is flipped and everyone is really being held captive in suspended animation submerged in slimy womb-like coffins. In a plot more sinister than the classic sci-fi movie Soylent Green, both the AI and humans (unknowingly) feed off harvested human babies. There is only one city left on earth, hidden deep within the core, which knows the truth of the Matrix and lives free from slavery. A small band of these survivors are tasked with finding a chosen one who will eventually free everyone from this slavery, and show them the truth of the Matrix. They find this person as one whom all his life has been struggling with the big questions in life and has attempted to understand the meaning of the Matrix. They offer him the pill of truth or a pill to go back into his non-reality of dream life in 1999. He takes the pill of truth. Why does this movie resonate all over the world, from people many economic levels and walks of life, after a worldwide release of only a few weeks?How does this movie speak to postmodern relativity in values, morals, and truth? Myths and symbols (Incidentally, neo means new.) Neo is then trained and prepared to fight the AI. Then, through a series of events, he gives up control and accepts his fate. He fights the AI. The Matrix is a movie that for the first time in recent memory displays such astute visual brilliance within a story that tickles the mind with a vivd array of complex, thought-provoking twists and turns, all of which leaves its viewers befuddled in such fiendishly gleeful ways. Then we're introduced to Thomas Anderson (Keanu Reeves), a computer software engineer who happens to be a nighttime hacker. More events too complex to describe come to pass before he is introduced to Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne), a man of one tone of voice who reveals to him a secret The Matrix is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth. The Matrix is the first science fiction movie in years to weave these intricacies amongst a vast arsenal of blistering visual effects that transport us into a world that becomes utterly real and truly frightening. In a genre where movies like Virus and Deep Rising are dominated by weak plots that serve as outlets for effects work and routine action (not that there's anything wrong with that), this film takes a different path. One of the most memorable shots of the film showcases a damaged helicoptor slamming into the side of a skyscraper in the Matrix the impact causes a ripple effect before the fantastic explosion, as if the fabric of the program is being ripped at the seams. There is one scene in which Morpheus remarks, Throughout human history, we have been dependent on machines to survive. Could it be that man's advancements in the world of computer technology went overboard? This calls into question just how exactly Neo came to question his reality. Had Morpheus been trying to make contact with him in times before the film's opening? If Neo begins to ponder his world, are there others like him who spend their lives waiting to wake from their dream? Could there be a bug in the Matrix program that provides such an outlet?For me, The Matrix is a movie that doesn't really need a concrete ending. That the Wachowski Brothers have chosen to avert any solid answers or clues only serves to enhance the overall meaning and quality of their work, and it remains the most intelligent and immersive factor of the film. The Matrix exploded onto the Sci-Fi scene. It redefined special effects, and more importantly to its fans, it combined its action\/sci-fi plot with that of a very complex story with well-developed characters. Morpheus (Fishburn) is an elusive legend among hackers. One night Neo (Reeves) receives a mysterious message on his computer, meets one of his companions - Trinity (Moss), and receives a call from the man himself. Something didn't feel right with the world. Morpheus believes Neo is The One. In order to show Neo what he believes to be true, he must show him the door. The Door out of the Matrix.You take the red pill - you stay in Wonderland, and I show you just how deep the rabbit hole goes.The world as he knows it is an illusion. Neo joins up with Morpheus and his crew to find out about the real world, and who he really is. The Matrix is a computer generated world used in the future to keep humans alive and mentally stimulated - because they are living in a perpetual state of sleep where machines are growing them to use as energy. Once awoken, Neo is in for the shock of his life as he realizes his entire life was a simulated lie. Spoon boy Do not try and bend the spoon. Neo What truth? Spoon boy There is no spoon.

The Stunt Man is one of the best films  ever made.  Period.  If anyone out there doesn't agree, I feel sorry for you,  because you just don't get it.  Are we clear on this now?Like many films that aren't always easy to categorize, Richard Rush'smasterpiece has apparently gone straight over the heads of some people --from the clueless studio clods who refused to release it, to some of the viewers  posting user ratings.  Ironically, I've read several criticisms here of thephotography.  What the hell are these people talking about?  The camerawork is  just one of the masterful elements of the film, featuring Rush's trademarktelephoto rack focuses, split-diopter 2-shots, mirror\/window reflectioncompositions and long, tracking\/Steadicam shots.  I consider Mario Tosi one of  the best DPs ever (check out Report to the Commissioner sometime if youwant to see one of the best lit films ever made), and his collaboration with Rush  could not have been a more creative one.But the cinematography, of course, is just one of the key components of thisunique movie.  Dominic Frontiere's alternately lively and melancholy score, Jack  Hofstra and Caroline Ferriol's (Biggerstaff's) frenetic, perfectly-paced editing  together with Richard Rush's and Larry Marcus's brilliant, textbook screenplay  all work in perfect harmony to make this a one of a kind, tour-de-force cinematic  experience.  Nothing like it has been made before or since.  It's funny,suspenseful, and terrifying.  And never before has the circus-like atmosphere of  a film crew on location been so perfectly captured; never has the craziness and  danger of stunt work (and movie-making in general) been so effectivelyportrayed.  Truffaut's Day For Night is a fine film, no question about it -- but with  all due respect to the great Francois, comparing the relatively simple Day For  Night to the sophisticated, multi-layered Stunt Man is like comparing a silent  student film to Citizen Kane. The passionate and colorful performances are of course the glue that hold all  this expert technique together.  Steve Railsback is perfectly cast as the paranoid  and frightened would-be stunt man, while Peter O'Toole has never been betteras his opponent -- the ambiguous, possibly dangerous and always- megalomaniacal director Eli Cross, who is put in the odd position of trying to  create the illusion of World War I with the reality of a Vietnam veteran.  Barbara  Hershey gives a highly-charged performance as emotional starlet Nina Franklin,  while Allen Garfield, Chuck Bail and Alex Rocco are all superb in keysupporting roles.But without question, the most dazzling talent on display here is director Richard  Rush.  From start to finish, he magnificently captures the crazy, surreal world of  filmmaking by dropping an unsuspecting participant into the mix and befuddling  him at every turn.  We, the layman, see the eccentric Hollywood smoke-and- mirror world just as Cameron perceives it -- with a combination of delight and  suspicion.  Just as Cameron is seduced by this world, he is also terrified by it,  and knows enough to suspect control freak Cross of absolutely anything --including murder -- to get his personal vision onto film.  It is this dichotomy -- the  obsession to create illusion, and the bizarre, often ugly reality that sometimes  rears its head along the way that makes filmmaking such a bizarre art, anddirectors such a fascinating species.  As some perceptive viewers have noted, there are many interesting details that  can be picked up on subsequent viewings -- but I wonder, how many of you outthere have noticed the subliminal?

Steve Railsback is perfectly cast as the paranoid  and frightened would-be stunt man, while Peter O'Toole has never been betteras his opponent -- the ambiguous, possibly dangerous and always- megalomaniacal director Eli Cross, who is put in the odd position of trying to  create the illusion of World War I with the reality of a Vietnam veteran.  Barbara  Hershey gives a highly-charged performance as emotional starlet Nina Franklin,  while Allen Garfield, Chuck Bail and Alex Rocco are all superb in keysupporting roles.But without question, the most dazzling talent on display here is director Richard  Rush.  From start to finish, he magnificently captures the crazy, surreal world of  filmmaking by dropping an unsuspecting participant into the mix and befuddling  him at every turn.  We, the layman, see the eccentric Hollywood smoke-and- mirror world just as Cameron perceives it -- with a combination of delight and  suspicion.  Just as Cameron is seduced by this world, he is also terrified by it,  and knows enough to suspect control freak Cross of absolutely anything --including murder -- to get his personal vision onto film.  It is this dichotomy -- the  obsession to create illusion, and the bizarre, often ugly reality that sometimes  rears its head along the way that makes filmmaking such a bizarre art, anddirectors such a fascinating species.  As some perceptive viewers have noted, there are many interesting details that  can be picked up on subsequent viewings -- but I wonder, how many of you outthere have noticed the subliminal?  I won't say where it is, but I will say what it is  a one-frame closeup of Steve Railsback, that could not be in a more perfectspot.

At least the old movies had much more love in them...I must be getting very old.But, if this would have been the only negative element about it, I wouldn't consider it a total disaster yet.

Well, I'm sorry to say this if you were stunned by seeing the ending but you can actually see it coming from a mile away...

Christian Bale on the other hand rarely gives away a bad performance. He really broke through with American Psycho but also his earlier films are surely worth a look.

In TV they use a technique called a one shot, one shot, two shot (I may be a little off on the title here. I don't work in TV). Anywho, this is basically a description of how to film a conversation. Film one person's face, then the other person's face, then them talking together. Its a formula. Its an EASY formula. The director of Bats thought, hey! I can use that! And he does...for a conversation of 6+ people. It is the most disorienting thing I have ever watched. There is all of this quick cutting around the circle of people in an attempt to give them all their screen time. And just when I started to feel like I was going to yak, they did what should have been done in the first place film all of them standing and talking together (the two shot) in a semi-circle that is diguised to not look like a semi-circle (Hollywood does this so well). Why didn't they just do this in the first place? Were all of the actors clamering to get their close ups?  We may never know. What we do know is that that technique should never be employed for conversations greater that 2 maybe 3 people and each person should have a few lines before the camera is cut away, not just No.There next filming mistake was the attack scenes that go on for a few minutes, but you still never know what is happening, or what happened until you see the corpses. Again to much fast cutting, and now blurry images as well.Now to step away from the camera stuff, we will examine the Bats themselves. I'm sorry, did you say Kermit was your father?

This time we also can see Rowan Atkinson in a small part, you will love it, I promise you, either you will laugh or you will think its idiotic, either way you'll think its entertaining! As when Topper starts shooting down people and a timer starts counting down records sat before, as Predator and Terminator. The first time you see Topper Harley is fine, he's fighting a brutal battle against a crazy Asian guy, and he glues iron stuff on his hands, Topper Harley glues gummy bears and chocolate on them. See it, but I recommend the first, that's even better.

If you've listened to the Made commentary, I'm paraphrasing his own words.  He was smart enough to know that most people who went to see this very small release would be the die hard Swingers fans.  We went, and we were thrilled to hear the Dean Martin opening song, and see the Double Down 11 license plate. So, playing on those Swingers expectations, I spent the movie thinking that Vince Vaughn's character would end up being the complete opposite of Swingers.  He was going to be a hapless loser throughout the whole movie and then save the day at the end.  One of the reasons I don't consider this a great movie is because that doesn't happen.  In fact, the ending of this movie was the most dissatisfying ending since The French Connection.  There is a scene towards the end of the movie where Bobby is in the back of the limo, and he's questioning where Ricky is.  I have a question for writer Jon Favreau.  WHERE THE HELL IS HE?  Faizon Love's character tells Bobby that Ricky is being taken care of.  So either he's dead, or he's gonna rescue Bobby, right?  Nope, he's just not there.  They set it up for a big ending, and then nothing happens.  Ricky just shows up on his own and screws things up even more. Again, I don't consider this a great movie because of the ending.  However, the thing to take away from this movie is the performance from Vince Vaughn.  The way he captures the subtle differences between Ricky and Trent is just phenomenal.  I've read other reviewers talking about how utterly annoying Ricky is in this movie.  I wonder if those same people loved Trent in Swingers.  I ask that because Ricky and Trent say a lot of the same things, and have the same mannerisms.  I would guess that if you read the two scripts on paper, Ricky and Trent come off very similar.  If you listen to the Swingers commentary, they talk about people reading the script and thinking who would like this character, referring to Trent.  Turns out everybody loved Trent, and everybody hates Ricky.So, the bottom line is, I don't think this was that good of a movie as a whole.  However, the performance from Vaughn, the homages to Swingers, and of course the Screech cameo make this movie worth a look...but probably just one look unless you're a huge fan of Swingers and\/or Vince Vaughn.

And the movie was for the most part entertaining enough, though I wouldn't rate the acting capabilities of Cruise, Cruz or Diaz very highly.I normally like films where you have to make sense of a seemingly jumbled chain of events and figure out the significance of what you're seeing (good recent examples being Memento and Mulholland Dr.). The quality I appreciate the most in these films is that they require you to think for yourself to work out a valid interpretation of the film (or at the very least piece everything together in the right order). The biggest flaw in VS is therefore the last half hour, where everything is laid out for you in excruciating detail.As I said, I don't know if this is just a carbon copy of the original Spanish ending but either way I see it as an insult to the viewer. It's basically the director saying I'm sorry for having let you watch 2 hours of something that might seem confusing.

A nice analogy can be made with the movie. Because of the half biographical, half fictional nature of the story it is impossible not to compare it to Milos Forman's Amadeus. And where Beethoven (in my opinion) surpassed Mozart later in his career, Immortal Beloved does not. I'm not saying that Immortal Beloved attempts to mimic Amadeus, but the comparison is certainly unavoidable.If, however, we judge Immortal Beloved in it's own right, it comes out quite well. Gary Oldman's performance is spectacular to say the least and carries this movie. Since I am dutch, Krabbé's accent, for me, was rather annoying, which blinded me somewhat to his acting. When I, at times forgot this, it seemed that his acting was honest and better than his average. The third performer that needs individual mentioning is Isabella Rossellini, who is at the same (high) level as the rest of the crew. So, overall, the acting was very good. It seemed like all members of the cast were enthusiastic about the film and put all their energy into the project.The story is very well constructed, although it is sometimes snowed under by psychological complexity. It seems to want to focus on to many aspects of Beethoven's personality, life, and surroundings at once. A little more simplicity might have served this movie well. The plot, though historically probably inaccurate, has enough impact to satisfy all the mystery and questions that arise in the plot. And though (as said) it very probably didn't happen that way, it serves very well to explain Beethoven's psychological problem (those of the movie-Beethoven that is), and, in all fairness it could have happened. All this makes the script one of the more well-constructed scripts in the past 10 years.So if all this is so right, what's wrong with it? The flaws of this movie, I feel, lie mostly in the often unjustly ignored facets of cinematography. The (visual) composition though never irritating also never stand out. The same goes for the colors. They are always good enough, but are never as power a reflection of the emotions in the scene as they could be. This applies to the editing and use of music as well. And it is in these respects especially that Immortal Beloved does not reach the greatness of Amadeus.All in all A very good movie with several amazing aspects. Tons of praise to Gary Oldman in one of the best performances of his career. The movie is very well researched and epic in it's ambition. That these ambitions aren't completely fulfilled is, tragic though it might be, only natural.For those who are interested what parts of the movie are historically correct (which one tends to wonder when watching a biopic like this), all major characters are correct, as are the basic relations between them. the letter around which the movie revolves actually exists, and most anecdotes truly happened. Historians and music scholars are still unsure about the identity of the immortal beloved.
