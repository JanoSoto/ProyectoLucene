Faust quickly caught my attention. After Murnau made Nosferatu, he was given the opportunity to do whatever film he wanted..and they gave him the huge budget to do it. The result was an impressive, visually stunning, supernatural film.God and the Devil are fighting for who gets to control humanity. They do a wager, they decide that if Satan (aka as Mephisto) can corrupt Faust then all of humanity would belong to Mephisto. After the wager is on, Mephisto spreads the plague throughout Fausts town and people start dying. He decides to call upon the powers of darkness to help people out.First off, more then anything, this movie is a true visual feast. How Murnau made this movie with the limited resources he had at the time is a true testament to his talent as a filmmaker. Heck, it was 1926, before make up fx, before stan winston, before blue screens and CGI, before anything! Yet, he managed to create an incredibly rich film. Heck this guy even managed to do a crane shot in the movie! In a scene where Faust and Mephisto are flying through the sky's...the camera swoops over a landscape filled with waterfalls, mountains and cliffs...all in one shot! I was actually amazed how with their limited technological resources Murnau managed to do this type of shot back in those days.The imagery is amazing...starting with Mephisto spreading his gigantic black wings over Fausts small town. I kid you not when I say that, that image is one of the coolest images I have ever seen on any movie. Images of the horsemen of the apocalypse riding the sky's....angels with swords, Faust conjuring up Mephisto by reading from his book...man this movie was really something to behold. Its all wrapped around that black and white aura that gives the film that eerie feel. Kinda like the same feeling I got when I watched White Zombie. I love black and white horror visuals. And Faust was full of them.Of special interest to me was that scene where Faust conjures up Mephisto by reading some words from a book, its truly a great movie moment with an incredible supernatural feel. The visuals of those circles of light emanating from the ground up towards the sky...that was amazing. And actually I think that scene influenced Francis Ford Copolla in Bram Stokers Dracula because he uses the exact same image of circles of light emerging from the ground.Faust fantastical imagery truly demonstrates that Murnau had complete and total control over everything that he showed on the screen. The snow, the wind, the shadows, the lights...all perfectly handled to create the exact mood and feel that was required at them moment. Its quite obvious as well that this movies benefited from a much much bigger budget then Murnaus previous films. The sets look a lot like those on Caligari at times, the detailed miniatures are very well achieved and the extras are plentiful.The performances are great, better then in Nosferatu. They are sometimes a bit exaggerated, but not as much as in other silent films I've seen before. On this one, the performances seemed just right to me. Of special mention is Emil Jannings as Mephisto. This guy played Beelzebub with some real relish. The character comes off as evil, treacherous, calculating...and he does it all with this smirk on his face. Great character. The make up on him is great and he kinda reminded me at times of Bela Lugosi as Dracula. But overall, hes performance was the best in the film. I also really enjoyed Camilla Horn as Gretchen, her scenes with her baby in the snow were great not only in the acting department but visually as well.Overall, Id recommend this movie to those of you interested in German silent cinema. Its really something to see how even in those days, the imagination and creativity was there. And even the limited technological resources couldn't hold them back from creating a truly beautiful, haunting, spooky, supernatural film. For those of you who enjoyed films like Murnaus Nosferatu or Robert Wienes The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari then you will most certainly love Faust.I would certainly say it is far superior to the films mentioned before, yet for some reason doesn't get as much recognition.

Christopher Nolan is a director with an impressive but very short CV and I confess, I had doubts. So I figured a little research was needed before I cough up the cash to go to the cinema and what better than his critically acclaimed smash Memento? I was a little concerned about not being able to follow the famously non-linear plot but all concerns evaporated quickly as I was soon absorbed in this original and intriguing thriller.Guy Pearce plays Leonard, the victim of a vicious assault where he was attacked and his wife was raped and murdered. As a result, Leonard has no short-term memory - he remembers everything before the attack but he is incapable of forming new memories, meaning he has to write down every important detail or tattoo it onto his body. Determined to find his wife's killer, Leonard soon finds himself assisted by waitress Natalie (Carrie-Anne Moss) and garrulous individual Teddy (Joe Pantoliano). But can he conquer his condition to bring the killer to justice? Memento is a very strange movie, filmed backwards but interspersed with the present, filmed in black and white. As a consequence, you quickly discover who the killer is and the clues reveal themselves instead of being formed. They just pop up in Leonard's pocket - a photo of a person or a new tattoo on his chest - but the film follows the reasons behind the clues rather than what the clues lead to. Once you've got your head around this unusual complication, Memento is a simply stunning film and a remarkable achievement. In terms of writing, editing, directing and acting, this is one of the best films that I have seen for many years. It is utterly captivating, drawing you into it's myriad story lines from the first frame. I can think of few other films with a better opening and due to its nature, it refuses to let go of your attention. Things like toilet breaks and food don't matter all of a sudden! Guy Pearce has done a fantastic job of bringing Leonard to life, surely the role of a lifetime and proves that LA Confidential was no fluke. Pantoliano is typically brilliant but Moss is a real surprise, providing depth and mystery to a character that would just be another love interest role in the hands of a lesser story-teller. Almost enough to banish memories of a certain cat-suit! The only thing I could criticise is the number of plot-holes but seeing as that universal plot-discrepancy device (a dodgy memory) is used, you could say that this isn't really a great point. The other thing is deciding how far back do you go - I still had questions at the end of the film but then again, so would Leonard. Memento demands your concentration and admiration in equal measures. It is a wonderfully complex and interesting thriller and offers some hope that Mr Nolan can resurrect the Dark Knight once again like Tim Burton did before him.

I was a little concerned about not being able to follow the famously non-linear plot but all concerns evaporated quickly as I was soon absorbed in this original and intriguing thriller.Guy Pearce plays Leonard, the victim of a vicious assault where he was attacked and his wife was raped and murdered. As a result, Leonard has no short-term memory - he remembers everything before the attack but he is incapable of forming new memories, meaning he has to write down every important detail or tattoo it onto his body. Determined to find his wife's killer, Leonard soon finds himself assisted by waitress Natalie (Carrie-Anne Moss) and garrulous individual Teddy (Joe Pantoliano). But can he conquer his condition to bring the killer to justice? Memento is a very strange movie, filmed backwards but interspersed with the present, filmed in black and white. As a consequence, you quickly discover who the killer is and the clues reveal themselves instead of being formed. They just pop up in Leonard's pocket - a photo of a person or a new tattoo on his chest - but the film follows the reasons behind the clues rather than what the clues lead to. Once you've got your head around this unusual complication, Memento is a simply stunning film and a remarkable achievement. In terms of writing, editing, directing and acting, this is one of the best films that I have seen for many years. It is utterly captivating, drawing you into it's myriad story lines from the first frame. I can think of few other films with a better opening and due to its nature, it refuses to let go of your attention. Things like toilet breaks and food don't matter all of a sudden! Guy Pearce has done a fantastic job of bringing Leonard to life, surely the role of a lifetime and proves that LA Confidential was no fluke. Pantoliano is typically brilliant but Moss is a real surprise, providing depth and mystery to a character that would just be another love interest role in the hands of a lesser story-teller. Almost enough to banish memories of a certain cat-suit! The only thing I could criticise is the number of plot-holes but seeing as that universal plot-discrepancy device (a dodgy memory) is used, you could say that this isn't really a great point. The other thing is deciding how far back do you go - I still had questions at the end of the film but then again, so would Leonard. Memento demands your concentration and admiration in equal measures. It is a wonderfully complex and interesting thriller and offers some hope that Mr Nolan can resurrect the Dark Knight once again like Tim Burton did before him.

Now, it might be a little violent in places but that doesn't mean it can't be good too. All the violence is completely necessary to the plot and character development and in fact it gives an impression of containing far more violence than it really has - surely one sign of a good movie already.The dialogue and the voice over is clever and witty e.g. I still can't think of anything to say. Ah, flashback humour. as the film catches up with itself and EN has a gun in his mouth.The editing is all neat and slick.The screen play and directing is outstanding. I was going to site an example or two but as I sit here, so many little scenes or parts of scenes suggest themselves that it impossible to pick one or two out, it's like trying to pick the best Beatles songs.The acting is monumental. Brad Pitt is somewhat larger than life but in fact he *is* larger than life. Edward Norton is ideal and it is so right that he isn't a hunk of meat like just about every other leading man these days.

To paraphrase his IMDb biography, his works are often metaphors for larger social questions that are left up to the viewer to answer. Hence, this in no way makes his work easy to grasp or understand; it may take repeated viewings, but the pieces will eventually fall into place.Let's reflect Videodrome (1983) explored the notion of reality-morphing television and technology and its fusion with human flesh - as witnessed by a man whose obsession with a strange television signal warps his perceptions of reality and he literally becomes a media assassin, as well as a human VCR with a vagina-like slit in his stomach to which a video cassette could be inserted; The Fly (1986) displayed the agonizing process of slow death and the effect it has on those involved - showcased by a woman having to watch her lover, a brilliant scientist whose DNA is mixed with that of a common housefly, waste away into something more terrifying; Cronenberg's third work of genius at this time, 1988's Dead Ringers, dissected duality, that two separate minds can possibly equal one whole body or personality. Cronenberg explored each of these with graphic special effects and detailed and imaginative storytelling, both of which earned him the love and following of many fans and essayists.Here, in Dead Ringers, Cronenberg explores this issue of duality, and the possibility that two individual personalities, twin gynecologists Elliot and Beverly Mantle (Jeremy Irons, in a hefty and confusing performance), are actually halves of a whole. Elliot is the smooth ladies man - confident, bright, highly sexual. Beverly is the more secretive one - confused, lonely, desperate.Based on supposedly true events and a book called Twins by Bari Wood and Jack Geasland, both men share each other's secrets, lives, patients, and sexual conquests of women. Sex comes up a lot in Cronenberg's film, and he uses it as a joke between the two twins You'd still be a virgin if it weren't for me, quips the extrovert Elliot to the introvert Beverly. Elliot and Beverly live together, but live as each other and can't live without each other; they would rather die than be separate.Things become complicated for them both when Beverly begins romancing a desperate actress named Claire Niveau (Genevieve Bujold), and for once he begins to come out of his shell when he finds that he's falling madly in love with her. She eventually discovers that Elliot and Beverly are twins. Beverly attempts to win her back when she calls it quits to their relationship and eventually does, but where does this leave Elliot, the smoother of the Mantle Brothers?It's not enough that Beverly is also hounded by a rather ghastly dream and he eventually begins down a tragic spiral of drug addiction, as does Elliot, who says that they share the same body and mind. The two brothers then begin attempts to separate, which will have tragic consequences for both of them.Cronenberg has a knack for getting commanding performances from his players and Dead Ringers is no exception. Irons puts on a confusing and masterful performance as both Mantle twins, as the film really makes you believe you're watching two men (when it's actually one man interacting with himself). Cronenberg utilizes extraordinary split-screen technology, body doubles, and editing to make you think Irons has a twin that nobody's ever seen before.

Obviously the last thing Carpenter was interested in was anything resembling accurate sociology; the bad guys are closer to the zombies from George Romero movies than to any real gang- they're completely emotionless, care nothing about their own lives, have an apparently limitless number of members, and have an almost supernatural ability to appear out of nowhere. The movie gets off to a shaky start as cops ambush several gang members (in a very 60s touch that's typical of Carpenter, the police shoot them down in cold blood). This scene is disconcertingly amateurish, and with its shaky camera movements, grainy photography, and unconvincing stunts, looked more like something I might see as a class project than as a John Carpenter-directed action scene. Luckily, the movie improves dramatically on from here, leading me to suspect that the movie was shot at least roughly in sequence and that Carpenter may have been still feeling his strengths. In the scenes that follow, Carpenter shows his usual skill at building up suspense, as the gang prowls the streets looking for a target on which to vent their rage and the usual varied group of characters assemble at a police station that's about to be shut down. As I also found of his later Escape from New York, Carpenter's action scenes are solid but somewhat lacking in punch, though here that's probably due as much to constraints of money and financing as it is of talent. Since none of the gang members seem to have any fear of death, their attacks mainly consist of charging armed defenders and quickly getting shot. The acting is a mixed bag, ranging from poor to solid, but luckily the leading actors generally fall into this category. Like the film school graduate that he is, Carpenter makes plenty of movie references and in-jokes- the basic premise is modeled on Rio Bravo and Night of the Living Dead. One of the two heroes, a black cop, tells a story about his childhood taken right from an anecdote that Hitchcock liked to tell about himself, while the other hero, a white convict, uses lines lifted right from Once Upon a Time in the West. All in all, Assault is a nice reminder of a time when enterprising filmmakers could make low budget genre flicks that were lean and unpretentious, instead of the solemn and bloated big budget efforts that now seem to be coming out very other week (painful memories of Man on Fire spring to mind).

It is long, expansive, filled with scenic and interesting changes of locales, and it is I suggest always an exciting cinema noir color adventure. The story was Hitchcock's, written as a film at his request by Ernest Lehman, and then extensively rewritten before production; at every point, I can attest, Hitchcock was increasing the realism of the treatment. The story, apart from its 'epic' feel and large number of characters, is another case of theRear Window, Man Who Knew Too Much genre that Hitchcock mined so extensively but did not discover. The ordinary man drawn into a web of adventure, intrigue and danger in this case is Roger O.Thornhill, Madison Avenue advertising executive. Mistaken for a government spy, he is kidnapped and taken to meet a mysterious master criminal. What follows is a succession of scenes logically developing from this premise, and one more--the fact that the spy for whom he was mistaken never existed...The scenes for which this film is famous for comprise more than almost any other suspense film can boast--the Long Island estate series, the United Nations series, the Chicago train station series, the 20th Century Limited series, the Four Corners highway series, the hotel series, the auction gallery series, the Rapid City series and the safe house series. The acting is also above average, especially Eva Marie Sant as Eve Kendall and James Mason as Philip Van Damm. Others in the cast include Martin Landau, Leo G. Carroll, Jessie Royce Landis and Josephine Hutchinson. But the understated achievement of this masterpiece of music (Bernard Herrmann), art direction, lighting, sound, costumes and settings is the dialogue. Hitchcock often used dialogue whose purpose was aimed at something other than the main purpose of the ongoing scene. The great scene where Van Damm tries to get Thornhill to confess what he doesn't know, the dinner scene between Eva Marie Saint and Cary Grant as Thornhill on a train escaping west, the hotel and auction house scenes and those involving the Leo G. Carroll as the devious Professor make possible much of the film's unusual power. Then there is the sheer physicality of the production's legendary action sequences--the car pursuit of an inebriated Grant, the crop-duster plane strafing sequence, and the final two scenes of Grant invading the enemy's house and then Grant and Saint escaping down the Mt. Rushmore monument have never been bettered. As Thornhill, Grant is more-than-adequate, since the director turned the story toward touches of comedy to relieve the tension he was building, though not ideal. The dozens of others in the large cast seldom have more than a few lines, save for Les Tremayne, Olin Soule, Patrick McVey and Ken Lynch in the auction scene and its aftermath. There are small errors in pacing several during the two sequences in the house used by Van Damm and elsewhere; and the line of development followed, though highly imaginative, was not always the strongest possible. But the artistry of this film is so well-realized that every scene, even the slightly imperfect, come near to being perfectly achieved, reinforcing their memorability. The love story involved incidentally is among the most interesting this side of Rear Window. It is to be regretted that Hitchcock never again attempted a film as important, long or impressively mounted as this one, although Topaze comes the closest. I confess to watching even half this film every time that I can; from the opening allegory of city life--in the form of levels of human traffic involvement--to the final allegory of sex in a train entering a tunnel, I find this film to be masterfully presented and vastly entertaining on many levels.

Its evil genius. Se7en opens with a homicide where a fatso is killed in a very strange manner. We meet Detective Somerset(Freeman) who is about to take off and detective David Mills(Pitt) has just fought to get assigned there. Somerset is calm, mature and has achieved mastery over his job. He probably seen so much that now he badly wants to go far away from this bloodshed. David appears cocky first but turns out amiable character of the film.

But all the while he's hiding something unsettling that you can't ever quite figure out. In Hearts in Atlantis, the latest of what by now must be a truly massive box set of Stephen King film adaptations, Sir Anthony finds a writer perfectly suited to these unique talents. What we see is a movie eerie and enchanting, both in mood and in style -- a story that holds onto its cards throughout, letting you see each of them slowly, one by one, and only when absolutely necessary. In the end we find we have been held captive by a stunningly memorable and powerful film.The story begins as a retrospective Robert Morse plays the older version of Bobby Garfield, the central character of this reminiscent story. It takes a recent tragedy to send the older Bobby unwittingly in the mind to his days as an 11-year-old in 1960. There we go to a place common to almost all of King's stories rural New England, where Bobby lives with his mother (Hope Davis), and spends his innocent, aimless days with his two friends Sully (Will Rothhaar) and Carol (Mika Boorem). His father died when Bobby was only five, and his mother is so busy hopefully tending to a real estate career that she has little time to tend to her only child. To this point nothing is out of the ordinary; this childhood is deliberately portrayed with hazy, warm undertones, akin to the sense of youth so familiar to many who look back upon it. Fairly early on we meet Ted Brautigan (Hopkins), a boarder who shows up quite suddenly on their porch, his belongings in grocery bags. He is clean, well-spoken, unobtrusive and generally a placid sort. But he is also an instant enigma he is of unknown origin, means, and intent, and Bobby's mother quickly decides this is a man to be viewed with caution. Bobby, on the other hand, innocently curious --and most likely desperate for anything that could spell the boredom of his uneventful summer-- decides this a man worth knowing. They become close, Brautigan dispersing kennels of wisdom and even offering young Bobby a dollar a week and cold root beers to read him the newspaper daily. But Brautigan clearly has a special quality about him he can sense things and see things that are not readily apparent to most others. Bobby seems to have this gift as well, though in a lees pronounced way, and through this they form a bond, one Bobby's mother slowly and begrudgingly affords him. She's suspicious of this man still, while we the viewers begin gradually to glean some of the mysteries of his past. I don't dare say what they are, but they do involve the Low Men, people, Brautigan warns Bobby, who may some day come looking for him. He tells Bobby what signs to look for about town, gently using the boy as a scout of imminent danger. Bobby does not know who they are or what they represent. Neither do we, for a long time, but the key instrument of this story is to make it intentionally vague. We are not to be concerned about these details, but rather to know that Brautigan has experienced them, and will do whatever he can to shield Bobby and his youth from the corrupting darkness looming behind them. Stephen King has been widely read as an author of horror and suspense, but his best works --like this one-- work on a much more insidious level, evoking a sense of foreboding and unknown that manages to inform everything that happens within. The makers of this film find great success emphasizing the shady murkiness of the story, and they still manage to keep things centered. The mysteries of Ted Brautigan find parallels in the wonders of youth Bobby experiences his first kiss, naturally, encounters a menacing bully, and learns to view his mother in evolving ways...grown-up ways. This is really a story of innocence and maturity, of youth's purity and the dangers that lurk at its end. Bobby finds that end to a certain degree, but along the way finds friendship, knowledge, and a sense of the mysteries of adulthood that await him. Ted Brautigan is really more than a friend to Bobby; he is a guide, a protector, and a teacher. These two actors provide real, natural on screen chemistry in this film, and there is one delightful scene early on where Brautigan intensely relives for Bobby a glory day of Chicago Bears football lore. This is an actor who can take any available strengths of writing and magnify them for us viewers who watch him say them aloud. As a result Anthony Hopkins anchors this infectious little film to the ground while still allowing it to soar skyward when needed.

In this attractive, rousing and well-acted compilation of two of the novels, the screenwriter, Aeneas Mackenzie, has taken liberties of course. But what we have, substituting U.S. accents for some upper class British types, is I assert a faithful and exciting realization of the Forester vision. Having read the series more than once, I suggest that Gregory Peck was almost a perfect choice for the hero's part apart from not being British. Others in the cast include Robert Beatty, virile as Mr. Bush, First Mate and Terence Morgan. As Lady Barbara Wellesley, pretty Virginia Mayo is equally un-Britannic and acquits herself with beauty and understanding of her role. The central character of these adventures is given in this film his most difficult assignment. He sails around the Cape of Good Hope and by use of a sextant alone contacts England's ally in the Pacific; only by the time he arrives, Don Julio Alavarado has renamed himself El Supremo and is demanding divine honors, while setting up a reign of terror. Obtaining the supplies he needs from the madman, Hornblower proceeds to capture a French ship much larger than his own; then when peace is declared between France and England and her allies, he has to attack El Supremo, in that larger vessel, to whom he delivered the vessel as his orders read; he Mundt do this to avert having made an enemy of England's new friend, France, into a dangerous force. What happens then, how he falls--hopelessly--in love with the Duke of Wellington's sister and what happens when he is captured, escapes the guillotine in France and brings home a lost ship and many impressed English seamen forms the bulk of the film. The direction by action film legend Raoul Walsh is often splendid; so are the battle scenes. The music, sets, costumes and lighting all deserve mention; the art director for the film was excellent also. This is a very intelligent film, with wonderful Forester dialogue, a triumph for all concerned. The climax actually takes place at the Admiralty when Hornblower reports to his superiors; the ending is satisfying and memorable. The only shame is no sequel was ever made. The underplot of Hornblower being a lower-class servant of upper-class masters and hiding his fears in battle by simply fighting through them is handled here in subtle fashion; but the idea of being a captain in the Royal Navy of the Empire poorly paid, without personal wealth and at the whim of fortune and Admiralty enemies adds to the goings-on enormously. This is splendid adventure film-making by any standard.

Superman is fondly remembered as one of the greatest films of all time. And Batman by Tim Burton is remembered as one of the most Gothic, and grim blockbusters of all time.This film is not an origin story in the truer sense of the word.

Batman scares a couple of punks into submission before Keaton delivers the epic line, that practically torpedoed all memories of television shows starring Adam West What are you? I'm BATMAN! The film's plot is quite thin and is more based around the rivalry of Batman and his arch-nemesis The Joker (played to perfection by Jack Nicholson) but the visual aspect of the film makes up for it.The only true downfall of this film is that Batman is not the main character. That right belongs to Jack Nicholson. This annoyed me somewhat, what with Keaton's scenes being so breathtaking (especially considering that there's such a small, slight man underneath all of that rubber!).

I expected the film to be another boring, dry comedy of the 90's featuring an out-of-place cast (minus Cyrstal). But as soon as I watched the first few scenes I felt something about this movie that made me feel good. Pretty much the story goes like this.Mitch Robbins (Billy Crystal) is going through a mid-life crisis and is yearning to just get away from the family and work and go away with some friends. Mitch finally is able to find a get away out west on the plains, a cattle drive vacation. Mitch would help drive cattle from new Mexico to Colorado. Accompanying Mitch are his two friends, Phil and Ed (Daniel Stern and Bruno Kirby) who are also down on there luck. Things don't go well at first, the cattle leader, Curly (Jack Palance) isn't well-liked by most of the other cattle drivers but Mitch establishes an unlikely relationship with him. As the group drives cattle, with probably the strangest group of people you could imagine, more issues and morals are presented such as friendship, respect, and family. The movie brings forth a lot of comedy, my personal favorite being th Shalowitz brothers who seem to now everything about ice cream and have competitions among themselves about what flavor goes best with each meal. Along with the comedy comes some fine acting by Cyrstal, Palance (Oscar Win), and Stern. The issues and morals presented are strong and easy to relate too. Palance finally won an Oscar for his role. He holds the base of the drama with Crystal helping at a few scenes.City Slickers utterly surprised me to be a well-written, well-acted, and above all else well-presented comedy\/adventure\/drama. It is easily one of the best comedies of the 90's and will remain in my book as a great film.City Slickers.
