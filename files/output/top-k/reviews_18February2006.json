Nobody knew who was going to win the big one, and I believe that is the reason Casablanca became so popular and has remained so popular ever since. This film is about sacrifice--about doing the right thing even if it is at the expense of one's own happiness. Casablanca takes place in Morocco towards the beginning of WWII. At this time the Nazis had captured France, but Morocco, a French colony, was still considered to be free; however, Nazi influence over the nation was growing ever more. In fact, it could easily be said that Morocco had become a Nazi puppet nation. It is in this atmosphere that we meet Rick (Bogart in his greatest role), a cynical night club owner who doesn't give a damn about anyone or anything. We soon learn that his miserable outlook on life was caused by a woman named Ilsa (played brilliantly by Bergman) who had jaded him long ago. It is here in Casablanca that Rick plans on spending the rest of his days in isolation--his love of life has been sucked right out of him. However, Rick's world soon comes crashing down when Ilsa comes walking into his gin joint with her husband Victor (Paul Henreid). Victor is a part of the French Underground and is on the run from the Nazis; his escape route led him directly to Casablanca where he is now searching for two visas to America one for him and one for Ilsa. In an ironic twist of fate, Rick happens to come across two visas when a friend of his, played by Peter Lorre, gives them to him to hide. Lorre's character was supposed to sell these very visas to Victor and Ilsa, and had arranged for a meeting at Rick's bar. Unfortunately, Lorre's character is arrested and thus Rick gets the visas. However Rick does not realize that these visas are for Ilsa and her husband, and Ilsa does not realize that the bar belongs to Rick, so when they meet it is by complete chance. Soon enough, Victor and Ilsa learn that it is Rick who has the visas and thus they try to persuade him to sell the visas to them. Rick is still bitter about being jaded by Ilsa long ago and therefore refuses to give them any such pleasure--Rick wants revenge. However Ilsa plans to persuade Rick, and in doing so she falls back in love with him--she is prepared to leave Victor for Rick, so long as Rick agrees to give Victor the visa. Rick agrees to the terms, and we soon have an uneasy feeling about the whole situation. This good man, Victor, may be getting a visa, but he is loosing a wife, and we know from Rick's experience that when people suddenly loose lovers they also loose their interest in life, and Victor cannot afford to give up his fight against the Nazis. It is here we see Rick's true character shine through all the cynicism; he engineers a plot that ensures that both Victor AND Ilsa get on that plane to America. Rick not only gives up any chance of getting out of Casablanca, but he also gives up Ilsa so that Victor may have her and that the both of them may continue their valiant underground fight against the Nazis. Rick also realizes that Casablanca has become too dangerous a place for Ilsa, and at the same time too dangerous a place for him as he is going to be punished for helping Victor, who is an enemy of the Nazis. Rick is prepared to sacrifice everything for a cause larger than himself, and that is why this film was so appropriate for the time in which it was made. Casablanca reminded America that they were now in a war and that sacrifice was going to be necessary of everyone--even those who wanted nothing to do with the world. Rick is the kind of person that we should all regard as a hero, for he puts aside his bitterness and even his own happiness for the sake of something vastly more important. Rick ensures that one of the underground movement's most valuable figures escapes the Nazis grip. However, Rick needed some inspiration in order to perform this valiant act. I believe that he was inspired by Victor, and came to realize that this man was an incredible human being. I also believe that Rick comes to realize that true love is doing what is best for a person, and not what is best for one's self, and thus he gives Ilsa up in order to ensure her safety. Rick was inspired by both patriotism and his devout love to Ilsa. Although Rick's actions may have been the result of some inspiration, they too would come to affect someone else the chief of the French police in Casablanca (played wonderfully by Claude Rains). Here is a man who hates the Nazis but obeys their commands because it is in his best interest. However, when Claude's character sees the valiant actions of Rick, he too decides to denounce the Nazis. Besides the wonderful message and a host of intriguing characters such as Rick, Casablanca offers so much more wonderful lighting, cinematography and acting, suspense, drama, romance, and some of the best lines ever written. Even the end of the movie is more than just a message; it also leaves us with a bitter-sweet taste, as Rick receives nothing and gives up everything. As stated, this was the kind of sacrificial attitude needed during WWII, and it is an attitude that continues to ring loud and clear throughout all desperate times. Casablanca deserves and receives 5 out of 5 stars.Copyright 2006 Imaginist ","genre":null},{"date":"18 February 2006","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Casablanca is a film that came out in 1942--a time of war and uncertainty.

The star, writer, director Cyril Collard has Aids and knows he is dying when making the film. He storms and rages against the forces of negativity and affirms life in ways that seem obscene to many, but really focus on the basics of life, love and the willingness to actually live your life, even knowing that you are about to die. To quote Dylan Thomas, He rages against the dying of the night. This is not a gloomy film, except for the immense talent that Collard has in a number of areas, not the least writing and directing. The tragedy is that his libertine life of reckless homosexuality killed him (and many others). Unlike Philadelphia, an artifice of politically correct, maudlin nonsense, this film has Aids sometimes right in your face and sometimes in the background, but it is always there. Hedonism killed many and still does in the Aids epidemic and in the U.S.A., this film would attract few positive reviews and almost no distribution because Collard refuses to play the victim game. Over 80% of Aids deaths have been caused by homosexual behavior. In the film Collard can't control his impulses and because of Aids he wants to squeeze as much out of life as he can. The love story with Laura, beautifully played by Romane Bohringer, is tragic in and of itself, but their love is fatally compromised by his disease. Collard desperately wanted to live his life with Aids and not have Aids run his life. Unfortunately, that is impossible, although he gives it a mighty effort to free himself from thoughts of death, which never really leave him. He continues to have grimy homosexual encounters, supposedly not involving dangerous sex (at least in the film); my surmise is that in real life he lived dangerously right up to the end. When he has sex with Laura the first time, he doesn't use a condom and doesn't tell her he has Aids--a classic kind of denial, an attempt to conquer the disease through action , which is selfish. Many homosexuals will see this film, which other scenes do not really show them in a positive light, as a film to suppress. Reckless behavior has volcanoed in the last few years, but gets no publicity because of the left-wing press who refuses to see Aids victims as anything but victims, who didn't really cause their disease. Collard's film slaps the faces of hypocrisy and lying about Aids again and again in this film. It is a testimony to his will to live and to make a film that doesn't cover up the reality of how Aids is spread and how little impulse control many gays have. Drugs will not stop Aids deaths, safe sex and sometimes no sex will. Also, and very important, Collard wants to show that the heterosexual relationship with a loving woman is the way to live your life, but for him his refusal to control his impulses and perhaps his genetic inability to control them (though that is difficult to infer), keeps him from what would have saved him. Hedonism is not spat on in this movie, but its terrible results in many cases are exemplified in the tragic death of such a talented and lovely man.

The great thing about him was that he didn't seem like your typical heroic figure and that puts him right at home in the seedy environment of film noir where everybody seems kind of crooked, even the police.Though he played kind of heroic figures there was always a sinister quality to him and this is played out beautifully in this movie where he seems to be most comfortable with the villains rather than the more straight-laced characters.The plot of The Big Sleep is so complicated that you are often thinking that you are being put on. Names and events are hurled at you every 2 seconds so if you only watch this movie once you will be totally lost. The most complicated character belongs to Lauren Bacall's Vivian. Marlowe is in the dark about her role up until the last 20 minutes or so and therefore it was really unbelievable that the role is played so well by Bacall (this was only her second movie).The whole movie is quite good but a little bit slow for my taste. If you have seen The Maltese Falcon it was definitely the better of the two. Still, there are those priceless moments when Marlowe goes into the Geiger bookstore and is met with the absolute hilarious line by the clerk What do they look like - grapefruits? The director, Howard Hawks, was certainly an actor's director and he gave some of the best roles to among others, John Wayne, Cary Grant, Gary Cooper and of course Bogie himself. This was as far as I can remember the last time that Bogie and Hawks worked together and I think that anything that they would have done afterwards could not live up to this, so maybe it was a good choice.

The great thing about him was that he didn't seem like your typical heroic figure and that puts him right at home in the seedy environment of film noir where everybody seems kind of crooked, even the police.Though he played kind of heroic figures there was always a sinister quality to him and this is played out beautifully in this movie where he seems to be most comfortable with the villains rather than the more straight-laced characters.The plot of The Big Sleep is so complicated that you are often thinking that you are being put on. Names and events are hurled at you every 2 seconds so if you only watch this movie once you will be totally lost. The most complicated character belongs to Lauren Bacall's Vivian. Marlowe is in the dark about her role up until the last 20 minutes or so and therefore it was really unbelievable that the role is played so well by Bacall (this was only her second movie).The whole movie is quite good but a little bit slow for my taste.

This all begins with the acting.John Cusack and Ione Skye give fantastic performances, and bring these characters of Lloyd Dobler, and Diane Court to life. Many women still believe in finding a guy like Lloyd Dobler, and that's because John Cusack and Cameron Crowe created a character filled with depth and sensitivity. A character that has his flaws, but still believes in finding something, something that will give him direction and a place in this world, and that something is Diane Court, played by Ione Skye. Although, her character makes questionable decisions at times and the fashion choices show all the big hats we dread to think of today, as ever wearing, the character still isn't one dimensional. She is conflicted not knowing how to break away from her overprotective father and create a life for her own. A father, that is played by John Mahoney, who creates a great portrayal of a man who wants to be everything to his daughter, because he fears that in any moment, she could stop being his, and he would be left alone. Although, the character does not always act honorably, well neither does anyone else in this world. The Boombox scene is infamous by now, being parodied constantly, and spoofed in random unfunny comedies. Although,considered a stalking type of behavior now, watching Lloyd Dobler hold a boom box up to Diane Court's room is easily one of the best romantic moments of all time. It could have easily been cheesy and stupid, but the facial expressions by John Cusack, made us feel for Lloyd and want him to hold that boom box playing Peter Gabriel's In your eyes, one more second Say Anything is a movie for the ages. When Lloyd's friends tell him not to be a guy to be a man, in that moment it was clear that this movie would stay throughout time as a classic '80s movie.

Everyone sees some different things in the story and characters. I think this also was what writer Paul Schrader and director Martin Scorsese had in mind, while making this movie. The story takes us into the world of Travis Bickle. We begin to see society through his eyes and we more and more begin to understand the character as the movie progresses. It makes his character not only a understandable one but also a very realistic one. Nothing in this movie is overdone or made to look better or worser than it is in real life.The movie is made extra powerful through the performances of the cast. Robert De Niro is a sensational main lead and the supporting cast is also real great. Some well known actors that were still unknown at the time of this movie make an appearance, such as a very young Jodie Foster, Albert Brooks, Victor Argo and an almost unrecognizable young Harvey Keitel.The entire movie is sensational- and with lots of style directed by Martin Scorsese, who knows how to set the right mood and atmosphere. The simple- but effective and realistic from Michael Chapman and the musical score by Bernard Herrmann (his last) also add to the atmosphere. Also of course the fact that New York City serves as the backdrop for this movie, gives the movie a typical dark and gritty feeling and atmosphere. Everything is slowly but powerfully build up in the movie and every sequences plays a significant role. A result of this is that the movie is filled with some unforgettable sequences, of which the famous 'You talking' to me?' sequence is the best known.

It's almost as if I felt Sam's pain. Michelle Pfeiffer's character was excellently portrayed as the self-centered, careless and wealthy lawyer. Even Dakota, who in her latest films has been a bit whiny, pulled a stellar performance. The father-and-daughter chemistry was perfectly maintained through-out the movie. The most touching scene in my 'heart of hearts' (bad pun, I know), was when Sam visits Lucy and she yells at him and he reads her the letter. I cried like a baby.

He sets up Truly, Madly, Deeply as a 3 hankie weeper as Juliet Stevenson mourns the death of her young husband, inadvertently asphyxiated by an endo tube after getting a sore throat. She isolates herself from her friends, gets snappy with well meaning relatives, bawls at the first cords of an overheard cello (hubby played one and she accompanied him on the piano), and winds up on a therapist's couch. Ah, she had such a sweet, caring, satisfying relationship with this talented, intelligent, good looking man. How tragic that his unfulfilled life should be cut so callously short leaving this truly wonderful woman bereft and in despair. So, here we are, the audience, blowing our noses, wiping our eyes, feeling her loss and wondering ourselves how we would handle such a dreadful event. We think of the lovers, spouses, children in our lives. How close and intimate we are with them and how close all of us are to being summoned by the Grim Reaper without notice. Our sympathies are totally with this grieving young woman. Imagine our glee when out of nowhere the decedent appears, back from the beyond, in the flesh. Amazing. We vicariously feel the thrill the wife feels as she leaps into his arms, madly embracing the man she thought she'd lost forever. He's back. All of him... and there's Minghella's rub. It soon becomes evident that the husband has returned, not to haunt her or torment her, but only to be himself and with a totally unexpected agenda. He returns with his good habits (they play the word games they always used to pass the time with, they frolic, they joke and laugh and look deep into each other's eyes) but he also brings along his bad traits, and it's difficult accommodating oneself to his pushy, egotistic behavior, even if he is a ghost. Patrick Sweazy made a back-from-the-dead flick (Ghost) where he hovered over Demi Moore and made her widowhood bearable. She always knew he was there. And what a wonderful guy he was. Sweetness and light. But TMD is no Ghost. Menghella says, instead, wait a minute. The one we grieve for was a multi-dimensional person. How soon we forget the bad and glorify the good. After the honeymoon is over, the widow in his movie begins to feel a bit crowded. Her husband's always complaining about how cold the flat is, turning up the heat, sneezing from the drafts, shoving up against her in bed with his clammy body. He's learned Spanish but his accent is atrocious. He brings back some friends with him, a motley crew, all polite, but given to watching videos (I Vitelloni, Hannah and Her Sisters) at all hours of the day and night. The husband rearranges the furniture. Then, she meets a wonderful man in a restaurant. He works with the disabled and does magic tricks. He wants to date her. She's attracted to him. But what does she do with the living dead hubby at home? How can she entertain anyone? Must her life now accommodate his death? Her therapist is noncomittal. The denouement is absolutely spot on.

She isolates herself from her friends, gets snappy with well meaning relatives, bawls at the first cords of an overheard cello (hubby played one and she accompanied him on the piano), and winds up on a therapist's couch. Ah, she had such a sweet, caring, satisfying relationship with this talented, intelligent, good looking man. How tragic that his unfulfilled life should be cut so callously short leaving this truly wonderful woman bereft and in despair. So, here we are, the audience, blowing our noses, wiping our eyes, feeling her loss and wondering ourselves how we would handle such a dreadful event. We think of the lovers, spouses, children in our lives. How close and intimate we are with them and how close all of us are to being summoned by the Grim Reaper without notice. Our sympathies are totally with this grieving young woman. Imagine our glee when out of nowhere the decedent appears, back from the beyond, in the flesh. Amazing. We vicariously feel the thrill the wife feels as she leaps into his arms, madly embracing the man she thought she'd lost forever. He's back. All of him... and there's Minghella's rub. It soon becomes evident that the husband has returned, not to haunt her or torment her, but only to be himself and with a totally unexpected agenda. He returns with his good habits (they play the word games they always used to pass the time with, they frolic, they joke and laugh and look deep into each other's eyes) but he also brings along his bad traits, and it's difficult accommodating oneself to his pushy, egotistic behavior, even if he is a ghost. Patrick Sweazy made a back-from-the-dead flick (Ghost) where he hovered over Demi Moore and made her widowhood bearable. She always knew he was there. And what a wonderful guy he was. Sweetness and light. But TMD is no Ghost. Menghella says, instead, wait a minute. The one we grieve for was a multi-dimensional person. How soon we forget the bad and glorify the good. After the honeymoon is over, the widow in his movie begins to feel a bit crowded. Her husband's always complaining about how cold the flat is, turning up the heat, sneezing from the drafts, shoving up against her in bed with his clammy body. He's learned Spanish but his accent is atrocious. He brings back some friends with him, a motley crew, all polite, but given to watching videos (I Vitelloni, Hannah and Her Sisters) at all hours of the day and night. The husband rearranges the furniture. Then, she meets a wonderful man in a restaurant. He works with the disabled and does magic tricks. He wants to date her. She's attracted to him. But what does she do with the living dead hubby at home? How can she entertain anyone? Must her life now accommodate his death? Her therapist is noncomittal. The denouement is absolutely spot on.

Eastwood is one of my favorite actors and directors although I haven't seen a lot of his work on Westerns so it was with high expectations I watched Pale Rider, a brilliant, beautifully made Western that continues to establish Eastwood as one of the most talented men in film history. Pale Rider has a deep story line, gritty, real characters and still hammers home the essential Western recipe necessary to make it great. One thing about Westerns is I don't think it necessarily has to have any great actors or characters. Westerns really are all about the setting. The gun fights, the lonely small towns, the evil gangs, the saloons and so forth so when you get a Western that still keeps those necessities alive and then provides incredible characters it's a very important film and Pale Rider does that!! Clint Eastwood takes on his usual role as the hero...a mysterious rider only known as The Preacher. Eastwood does what he does best, he's macho and dark and gritty although I thought his performance as The Preacher had a little more depth than some of his previous Western characters. He has a past, he's mysterious and mystical and it all shows in his body language. Even his voice was a little less raspy. Nonetheless it's a stellar performance. Michael Moriarty gives a stand out performance as Hull Barret, the leader of a small camp of pan miners looking for gold. They and their families are constantly being harassed by a local big shot rich man and his family in an attempt to drive them off the land. During an unfortunate run in with some members of the LaHood family Barrett is saved from a brutal beating by the preacher. Moriarty shows some real strength and depth to his character and is a great hero that shows real emotions. Carrie Snodgress plays Barrett's love interest\/fiancé Sarah Wheeler who unintentionally falls for The Preacher. Her role is rather drab and doesn't carry a lot of weight. I thought her character was more annoying than anything. Sydney Penny plays Sarah's daughter Megan. Her performance is quite well done and she too falls in love with The Preacher. She shows a lot of emotion and does well for a young actress. The late Chris Penn plays the bad guy Josh LaHood. He looks very young, and thin and a little green around the edges but he still has a scowl and way about him that makes him a mean bad guy. He doesn't stand a chance against Eastwood but very few actually do. John Russell plays Stockburn, the lawman hired to get rid of The Preacher and get the rest of them off the land. He's only in it briefly but his facial expressions and quiet tone makes you wish the battle between him and Eastwood lasted longer. The rest of the supporting cast are worthy and fit in well and everyone does a decent job.Eastwood as director is a perfect fit and by the time he made Pale Rider, he was an old pro. And Eastwood and Westerns are like Coffee and cream...a perfect match. The story is well done and interesting, the usual Western stereotypes are downplayed a little in order to provide a different sort of style that really draws you in. But it never deviates too much from what everyone loves about a Western. You have to be a fan of Westerns to appreciate them so if you are than Pale Rider is an absolute classic that must be seen. I only wish there had been a sequel or prequel to follow up on the entire back story because there was plenty there. Another Eastwood classic for sure!! 9\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"18 February 2006","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Now it's true it's been years since I've seen Unforgiven and I will see it again soon I hope but I remember thinking it was one of Eastwood worst films (entirely in my opinion.)

It features Michael Douglas as pot-smoking* literature teacher Grady Tripp, about to go on a voyage of self-discovery. Looking back on it, Tobey Maguire's character James Leer was a sort of precursor to Spiderman, the way he was looking for his place in life (as it was, he played similar characters in The Ice Storm and The Cider House Rules). Probably the most effective scene in the movie is when the book gets destroyed; it shows how Grady manages to start over in life. All in all, I would consider this part of Curtis Hanson's troika of masterpieces, along with LA Confidential and 8 Mile. Also starring Robert Downey Jr, Frances McDormand, Katie Holmes, and Rip Torn. And of course Bob Dylan sings the Oscar-winning song Things Have Changed (and he looked like Vincent Price at the Oscars).*Ironically, later that year Michael Douglas played a drug czar in Traffic.
