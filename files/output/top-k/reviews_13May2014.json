[{"date":"13 May 2014","score":"","review":" Shrek is a charming tale about a lovable green ogre (played by Mike Myers, famous for his acting in the Austin Powers series) who wants to be alone in his swamp. One day, however, an evil lord named Farquaad (played by John Lithgow) enforced a law that bans all fairytale creatures. The now homeless creatures seek refuge in Shrek's swamp, which as you might expect, irritates our hero. Shrek teams up with a talking donkey (played by the always amazing Eddie Murphy) to confront Farquaad. Farquaad agrees to give Shrek his swamp back on one condition that he bring Princess Fiona (played by Cameron Diaz) to him so he can wed her. Shrek agrees and he and Donkey are off to the tower to save the princess, but encounter a dangerous fire-breathing dragon! Donkey uses his suave looks and personality to woo the dragon. Shrek rescues Fiona, and over the course of the movie, they begin to bond and grow closer to each other. But all seems ruined when Shrek misinterprets Fiona and Donkey's conversation about not wanting to marry a beast, as its revealed that Fiona is actually an ogre herself! Shrek heroically sacrifices his home and current life to gain a new, better one with Fiona in an amazing adventure.The movie is hilarious, full of humor for both the children and the parents, and all around a jolly good time. The cast is fantastic and I'm glad they all returned for the sequels, which are all just as good as this masterpiece. Shrek is clearly a force to be reckoned with. I can't recommend it enough.11\/10. Go get it now.
