Love him or hate him, he's undeniably an original. Fans will enjoy his work because his name is attached to it. Haters will condemn it for reasons of same. He's an auteur. He's a brand name. He's a filmmaker of repute, an award-winner, and a Hollywood self-starter free from the reins of studio interference. he's not just some guy putting his fantasies onscreen, an important disctinction. 3) The film adds up. Maybe not on a first viewing. Maybe not to the degree of more narratively simplistic, plot-driven movies. Not even in the way that ostensibly alternative films like Memento or Fight Club add up -- with enough clear exposition to connect the dots for the viewer. There's nothing wrong with that kind of surprise wrap-up that's just not Lynch's path here. Those who pay close attention may be the most frustrated; those who guess the meaning halfway through as a joke may be correct. But there is logic. It is not a random assemblage of memorable vignettes, although it does work that way, too. It's a tightly constructed, evocative work, and it can be figured out. It begs to be figured out, actually. This last fact is the one in greatest debate. Some posters have already unravelled the film's plot and meaning -- good summaries, actually, and exactly what I arrived at after multiple viewings -- but that's not the measure of this film. As far as I'm concerned, it could make zero sense and still warrant praise based simply on its brilliantly atmospheric direction, the quality of its performances, the chill generated by its score or the nasty humour that unerlies even its most surreal moments. It would be a classic just for the way the camera prowls around corners and creates an expectation of real horror, just for Naomi Watts' audition scene, just for the performance of Crying by the Spanish nightclub singer.The other ten best films of 2001 put together fall short of the combined impact of these few moments, even if you think they make no sense.   But to me, it does make sense, and not, as some negative writers have suggested in their messages, because I want it to. (I'm pretty sure I speak for the film's fans in explaining that difference.)  I didn't put it together until the third time, and the four times I've watched it since only confirm my reading. I'm happy with it, I like it, and I really don't think that makes me a simpering art film snob or a condescending Lynchophile. I was entertained by a movie and wanted to keep watching it. Good for me, I guess, and good for the movie in question.    It's no one person's place to hold the comments of others in contempt. The negative posts about this film are accurate to those who made them. I wish they'd enjoyed the film like I did, but they didn't...too bad. I hope they liked something else, but I'm not wrong, either. To me, Mullholland Drive is a movie that is definitely not like leaving the TV on it challenges, frustrates and ultimately rewards. It's also so, so entertaining, so lush and sensual, so perfectly pitched in its film noir references, so funny, so original, so damned good, so Lynchian. OK fine, I'll give a little hint as to what I think is going on, but only for people who've watched it, thought about it, and need a little push in the right direction. *** SPOILER ***  Coco reallly IS Adam's mom. Which means the party at the end(?) really is happening, and everyone there is who they say they are at that point, including Diane, Camilla, Adam, and even the Cowboy. Then remember the second shot of the film (Diane's pillow in close-up) and the Cowboy's line after Rita\/Camilla opens the blue box time to wake up now, pretty girl.

No, although it does reuse, recycle and remix key plot points and storylines from the super-hero films that precede it. Spider-man never fully takes off, and rather is content on being a fluff introduction to its title hero, filled with some campy style, dead-end dialogue, and matinee drama.The film does stay true to most of the origin of Spider-man from the original Stan Lee comic (in a blink and you'll miss cameo). Peter Parker, a teenager that is picked on by his classmates and who has in fact been in love with his next door neighbor Mary-Jane for the longest time, is suddenly endowed with spider-like powers as a result of being bitten by a radioactive spider while on a class field trip. As he discovers the powers, his best friend Harry's dad, Norman Osborn, a brilliant scientist who's experimental project to create a new weapon for the army is in financial trouble and thus decides to test it out on himself, but in result becomes the villain dubbed as Green Goblin.Tobey Maguire is a nice choice for Peter Parker, as are most of the casting choices for the film. By far the most entertaining role belonged to J.K. Simmons who plays the cigar-smoking J. Jonah Jameson from the Daily Bugle, a paper which Peter Parker sells photos of Spider-man to. Those scenes made me smile and remember some moments from the early cartoon. In fact Sam Raimi kindly inserts nostalgic elements from the early 'toons and comics throughout the movie, perhaps to satisfy the purist of Spidey fans. Now I don't know about you, but I would much rather watch a great Spider-man story told on screen rather then a few live-action recreations. In that respect the script had a lot to do with why this film just didn't deliver as well as it could.I always wonder why it is in super-hero movies that the unstoppable villain is always created at the same time as the all mighty hero. Now I understand that the film may need a villain otherwise this just leaves Spider-Man discovering his powers the whole movie while fighting `regular' criminals (then again would that have been such a bad thing? This is a movie about Spider-man). I think about movies like `Unbreakable', `Batman' and even `Batman Returns', where the villains are handled much better in the storyline, and I feel as though they have a reason to be there, more than just to be part of the movie.This is big budget pop-corn film not unlike any you've seen before. It drags to make up for what should be story-telling and the special effects come up short many times throughout, and that's unbelievable when you figure they had a 120 million dollar budget for this thing. I just didn't see the value on screen. They should have cut some of those out and made room for more character development, after all they do set up a sort of love triangle between Peter, Harry and Mary-Jane. I would have loved to actually feel some tension in those scenes instead of just having them involved because the script called for it.If by now your thinking this thing is filled with plot-holes, then your right! And please don't say that it's just a comic film and that it's ok. Sure, some of the hero stuff you just have to let slide, but I know that this story could have been told much better than it was, but this is not why I gave it 2 out of 4 stars. I actually found myself getting annoyed when scenes between characters we're cut short by some lame explosion and\/or action sequence. Enough already! I want to know more about these people. Willem Dafoe actually managed to have a great scene, where he argues in front of the mirror with his Goblin counterpart. Well done, but scenes like this we're way to few and far between.The ending of this movie, especially the battle scene between Spider-man and Green Goblin, is near laughable and goes by so quickly it makes you wonder what we'd been building up to exactly. I would love to openly say the problems and plot holes they leave at the end, but as always I attempt to keep my reviews spoiler free. Just know that I was in complete shock by the behaviors of these characters in reaction to each other based on the way they'd been behaving the whole time. And Green Goblin's dialogue is pure recycled garbage villain dialogue from a million other films before. Sheesh!Basically there is some nostalgia involved when seeing a comic hero I read, drew, and role played in my early years growing up, finally make it onto the big screen. It's larger than life itself. The medium of film has perfectly evolved to make a character like Spider-man shine, and knowing that adds to the disappointment of watching the end result. This could have been an instant classic, but here and now it is happy with simply being the flavor of the month.Extra Note I actually liked the fact that they made the webbing come out of Spider-man's wrists, seemed much more logical than him creating those incredible web-shooters and fluid like in the original comic. But I wonder; since they filled this film with so much ridiculous stuff, why not just leave them in. They could have been used to put him in all kinds of other dangerous situations, like he could be in a situation where he runs out of webbing, so on.

Spider-man never fully takes off, and rather is content on being a fluff introduction to its title hero, filled with some campy style, dead-end dialogue, and matinee drama.The film does stay true to most of the origin of Spider-man from the original Stan Lee comic (in a blink and you'll miss cameo). Peter Parker, a teenager that is picked on by his classmates and who has in fact been in love with his next door neighbor Mary-Jane for the longest time, is suddenly endowed with spider-like powers as a result of being bitten by a radioactive spider while on a class field trip. As he discovers the powers, his best friend Harry's dad, Norman Osborn, a brilliant scientist who's experimental project to create a new weapon for the army is in financial trouble and thus decides to test it out on himself, but in result becomes the villain dubbed as Green Goblin.Tobey Maguire is a nice choice for Peter Parker, as are most of the casting choices for the film. By far the most entertaining role belonged to J.K. Simmons who plays the cigar-smoking J. Jonah Jameson from the Daily Bugle, a paper which Peter Parker sells photos of Spider-man to. Those scenes made me smile and remember some moments from the early cartoon. In fact Sam Raimi kindly inserts nostalgic elements from the early 'toons and comics throughout the movie, perhaps to satisfy the purist of Spidey fans. Now I don't know about you, but I would much rather watch a great Spider-man story told on screen rather then a few live-action recreations. In that respect the script had a lot to do with why this film just didn't deliver as well as it could.I always wonder why it is in super-hero movies that the unstoppable villain is always created at the same time as the all mighty hero. Now I understand that the film may need a villain otherwise this just leaves Spider-Man discovering his powers the whole movie while fighting `regular' criminals (then again would that have been such a bad thing? This is a movie about Spider-man). I think about movies like `Unbreakable', `Batman' and even `Batman Returns', where the villains are handled much better in the storyline, and I feel as though they have a reason to be there, more than just to be part of the movie.This is big budget pop-corn film not unlike any you've seen before. It drags to make up for what should be story-telling and the special effects come up short many times throughout, and that's unbelievable when you figure they had a 120 million dollar budget for this thing. I just didn't see the value on screen. They should have cut some of those out and made room for more character development, after all they do set up a sort of love triangle between Peter, Harry and Mary-Jane. I would have loved to actually feel some tension in those scenes instead of just having them involved because the script called for it.If by now your thinking this thing is filled with plot-holes, then your right! And please don't say that it's just a comic film and that it's ok. Sure, some of the hero stuff you just have to let slide, but I know that this story could have been told much better than it was, but this is not why I gave it 2 out of 4 stars. I actually found myself getting annoyed when scenes between characters we're cut short by some lame explosion and\/or action sequence. Enough already! I want to know more about these people. Willem Dafoe actually managed to have a great scene, where he argues in front of the mirror with his Goblin counterpart. Well done, but scenes like this we're way to few and far between.The ending of this movie, especially the battle scene between Spider-man and Green Goblin, is near laughable and goes by so quickly it makes you wonder what we'd been building up to exactly. I would love to openly say the problems and plot holes they leave at the end, but as always I attempt to keep my reviews spoiler free. Just know that I was in complete shock by the behaviors of these characters in reaction to each other based on the way they'd been behaving the whole time. And Green Goblin's dialogue is pure recycled garbage villain dialogue from a million other films before. Sheesh!Basically there is some nostalgia involved when seeing a comic hero I read, drew, and role played in my early years growing up, finally make it onto the big screen. It's larger than life itself. The medium of film has perfectly evolved to make a character like Spider-man shine, and knowing that adds to the disappointment of watching the end result. This could have been an instant classic, but here and now it is happy with simply being the flavor of the month.Extra Note I actually liked the fact that they made the webbing come out of Spider-man's wrists, seemed much more logical than him creating those incredible web-shooters and fluid like in the original comic. But I wonder; since they filled this film with so much ridiculous stuff, why not just leave them in. They could have been used to put him in all kinds of other dangerous situations, like he could be in a situation where he runs out of webbing, so on. Ah I can go on forever, but this isn't relevant to the film.

Fine acting, good direction, first class production values.  But in the end, it falls victim to what sinks most American films these days, an under written script.The film tells the tale of Connie Sumner, a well off East Coast housewife who is another one of those movie versions of the woman who has it all --  loving husband, nice kid and a very comfortable existence. (American movies, caught up in materialism, play on the fear factor, showing audiences how much they have to lose. Don't let them take it away is the number one theme.)  But one fine day while on a shopping trip to Manhattan, she gets caught up in a movie wind storm second only to the one that sucked up Dorothy and she lands in the arms of Paul Martel,a French-born book dealer.  They start a torrid love affair.That's the story, or at least about 75 percent of it. With no subplot, the movie focuses on the affair and little else and while the couplings are fun to watch, it is a remarkably bland affair with few bumps along the way on the road to orgasmville.That's the problem.  We get way too little from this movie in terms of who, what, when, where and why.  Diane Lane does a first class job as Connie, Richard Gere is also excellent as her husband, Edward.  Oliver Martinez would seem to be just right as the sexy foreigner.But the movie never answers the question, what is this affair all about?  Lane is depicted as a woman with a very nice life.  She has money and security. Her husband is handsome, successful, attentive to her and a great dad.  Connie herself does not seem unhappy. We never learn why she is willing to risk everything. Diane Lane's character remains an enigma throughout the film.In the late seventies, a French film, called After Sex in America, dealt with the same topic.  But there, actress\/director Brigette Rouan at least gave us a hint as to why she strayed from a good marriage.  It was because she saw the handwriting on the wall, or rather in the mirror.  She was getting older and soon, the chances for finding an exciting romance would be few and far between.  She needed that kind of excitement in her life, if only one last time.That may be Lane's motivation, too, but if so, it doesn't really wash.  The film goes to no small lengths to prove to us that Lane herself is drop dead gorgeous.  That wind in the beginning practically tears her skirt off her, giving us the best shot of a pair of great gams since Rita Hayworth. She must have had many other opportunities, and she might have them for another ten years to come. She is that handsome of a woman. And Martinez doesn't exactly go out of his way to court her.  She comes to him, over and over again, so it is not the thrill of just getting some attention.American movies often skip over the motivation part to get to the action part, and that is what director Lyne seems to have done, perhaps afraid that showing motivation would make his film too intellectual.But I kept wanting Lane to spill the beans to somebody about why she was doing all this.  Publicity accompanying this film has indicated Lane is supposed to be having the best sex of her life.  Maybe true, but press releases don't count.  You're supposed to put the story up there on the screen.  Maybe we were just supposed to get it --that she liked having orgasms.  Ok, but there's no reason to believe she wasn't having them with her husband.  In the end, I get the feeling logic and motivation took a back seat to gee whiz movie making here.  Getting a chance to watch Diane Lane get her panties ripped off her, then turn around and bend over to receive her lover was supposed to make us forget that not many women with as much to lose as she had would have done that in the hallway of an apartment building. Not many would have had hot sex in a bathroom stall in a restaurant, while her two girlfriends were waiting for her at the table.Was it the thrill? The danger?  If so, why did she want danger?In the end, this was movie making that went for the cheap thrill over solid plotting, which makes the highly ambiguous, art house ending all that much harder to understand.  This was movie making that could have said a lot more, but chose to follow the Hollywood formula instead.  I can give this only a tepid endorsement.

And fans on Seagal, Damme and other action kickers\/fighters should also like the often nihilistic attitude of The Hunted.6\/10 and I recommend this to action film fanatics especially!

Lawton) who wrote us the first Under Siege movie with Steven Seagal, directed by Andrew Davis. The Hunted stars Christopher Lambert who was OK in Highlander by Russell Mulcahy and who is not too bad action star. The Hunted is not a great movie but it should satisfy action fans, especially mainstream action fans.Chris is an American businessman visiting Japan and he sees the secret face of a masterful assassin, somekind of a yakuza cult member\/leader. Soon Christopher finds himself in the middle of bloody and fastly edited swordfights and understands that his life is what they want. He gets some help from a rival gang and now they must destroy the evil clan that is on their tail..There is one extremely suspenceful sequence in a train, which is filled with evil ninjas and so no passenger is safe. The train goes fast and there's no way to escape. That sequence is a highlight of this film and proves that the director can direct great action scenes if he wants to.

I'd seen various excellent reviews, marvelled at the online trailer and walked past many posters and a stall at the recent Duxford airshow consequently my expectations were high.It wasn't a bad film but it was no where near as good as the reviews imply. I'd hoped for a film about WW2 flying that had a minor love story component and regrettably encountered the reverse. I'm not adverse to love storys and emotional content (I enjoyed 'Titanic', 'Truly Madly Deeply' and 'Cyrano De Bergerac' amongst many others) but this seemed bolted on as a plot device.The much vaunted flying sequences comprise a tiny fraction of the whole and are largely in the trailer. They are also not that impressive, much to my surprise. I had a real problem with the so called English airbase; surrounded by mountains and fir-trees. OK, so the crew had to film in Europe but they could have found somewhere a bit more realistic surely?! There's an implausibly lucky escape from a crashing Spitfire too a bit of plot worthy of Neighbours not Tolstoy!The real problem with 'Dark Blue World' is lack of emotional intensity. It tries hard to give an air of brooding menace and betrayal but achieves neither. I never felt engaged with the characters and was totally ambivalent when cast members were shot down.This would have made a reasonable ITV drama production and that about sums up the production values and impact. A shame because I'd wished for more.
