The people who make it great are director Hal Ashby for creating a quiet atmosphere with a little help from cinematographer Caleb Deschanel's gray skies and maroon -shades-lighting, and especially Peter Sellers, whose performance mixes HAL 9000 with Rain Man or Forrest Gump. Peter Sellers is Chance, a TV-watching gardener who spends his whole life just being there. In a scene whereShirley MacLaine is crying, he says I understand. We know that he just says that because that would be the typical thing to say, but Shirley MacLaine thinks he really understands. When Chance gets asked about a subject he knows nothing about, he starts talking about gardening, which is mistaken for metaphoric speech.  At the end, he has appeared on national TV and is famous. He doesn't understand why, or even what it means to be famous, or wise, or anything at all. He just does whatever he somehow  (probably by the TV) has been trained to do. Being There is one of the few movies that says a lot by being quiet. There is never more emphasis on some scenes or lines of dialogue than others, and almost like Chance the Gardener, it doesn't seem to notice its poignancy.(The Truman Show is an example of the opposite of this.)It just tells a story that's poignant. Being There does have some flaws, though. The closing scene and the scenes where people mistake Chance's talk about the garden for profundity seem a little bit awkward, but they still don't spoil an otherwise great movie.

I thought it was confusing, but maybe I'll just have to see the movie again to sort things out. Chinatown's tragic ending, one of the highlights of the script has been considered one of the greatest movie endings of all time. It should be known that it was written not by Robert Towne, but by Roman Polanski. I thought the ending was good, but the only scene set in the film's title location went by too quickly. Roman Polanski with help from cinematographer John A. Alonzo created an excellent atmosphere with some scenes in  darkness, and some in blinding sunlight. The acting of Jack Nicholson, Faye Dunaway and John Huston is also very good, but they're not 5 star performances.  And Jerry Goldsmith's musical score is one of the best I've ever heard. I have no trouble at all with Chinatown ranking #19 on the AFI's Top 100.

The trailer was good, it looked like a great thriller.  It fell quite short of being great however.  Cage's portrayal of Rick Santoro was excellent.  Brian DePalma made this one visually memorable as usual.  But the end was a major letdown.  Few people know that there was originally a tidal wave scene that was cut out of  the movie because DePalma feared Snake Eyes would look like a disaster movie.  However, very short parts of this sequence were left in the previews seen on TV.  Including, if i'm not mistaken, Cage's line I'm not going to let you kill her. In short, I was expecting a water filled ending that never comes.  It was the most obvious case of a scene being omitted that I've ever witnessed.  DePalma took out the wave scene and put nothing in its place causing the film to end quite ubruptly.  This was the only disapointment to an otherwise good thriller.
