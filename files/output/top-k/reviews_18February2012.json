[{"date":"18 February 2012","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Michael is a college professor. His son is trying to deal with his girlfriend. You see, his wife died a few years ago, in a tragically contrived flashback. One day, he spots a child walking down the street. Just before he can yell at the kid to get out of his way, he notices that he's bleeding(and, you know, if he'd have had a cell, he wouldn't have had to just walk, you know... I'm just saying, mom), and rushes him to the ER. While he's disappointed he doesn't get to see Clooney smile and nod, the big moment in this opening comes when he, prompted by a nurse, after tasting his lips very thoroughly, admits that he doesn't know the boy's name! Because do you really know your suburban neighbour(no, I mean, *really*? Are you sure they aren't trying to detonate government buildings?)? He meets the parents, who live next door. They develop a friendship. However, not long after, he begins to suspect them of being domestic terrorists(what, you've never done that?). One thing that permeates this is that it is a piece of Hollywood propaganda. It wants you *terrified*. Sure, they do admit that not everything that looks like it could be a case of it actually is, still, this point is eventually completely lost near the time the end credits roll by. Extremists with explosives is no small matter, but this blows it out of proportion(...pun not intended, I swear). The bad guys are ridiculously competent(and not characterized beyond being ruthless... can you say superficiality?) and everyone who could help Mike is more in his way than at his side. It is funny to see the wannabe spy stuff. You know, around the block, and done by, well, a friggin' teacher. Anyway, with that out of the way, this is produced quite skillfully. The acting, except for our lead's offspring(whose role I would personally grant a name change), is rather good. Those who need to be, are pretty creepy. For being directed by someone who came from music videos(hey, those can go either way... remember, I can say McG faster than you can say Brett Ratner), it's remarkably effective. It's tense and exciting, and builds nicely to its memorable climax(some refer to the very ending as a twist... I don't know, I suppose it qualifies, and it certainly is clever, and surprising). The pacing is relatively solid, it's not boring(mind you, I'm not sure it needed to be 110 minutes), if it is predictable and clichéd(if you do not see most of what happens in this coming from almost right away, you must be new to this medium). It's filmed and edited well. The use of slow-motion is on the verge of being excessive, though it comes out on the right side. There is a bit of bloody, disturbing violence and a little strong language in this. I recommend this to fans of thrillers. 7\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"18 February 2012","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Michael is a college professor.

As the poster of the movie tells, this movie stars Tom Hanks as Paul Edgecomb, senior prison guard of the mile, and as always he performs very well indeed. Yet the cast around him is even more spectacular, perhaps partially due to them being relatively unknown. With a face you know, one inevitably remembers previous performances, and the new role is coloured by this. Doug Hutchison as Percy Wetmore, a mean spirited prison guard was particularly impressive, yet his character could have been given more depth. The most captivating was the performance of Michael Duncan.It is hard to find a flaw in this movie. The camera-work is superb, cast wonderful and direction flawless. The movie's considerable length, a bit over three hours, is something that had me worried. Yet the marvellous cast and the peaceful yet firm pace of the movie held my attention progressively through the three hours right to the touching culmination. Many will find this movie to be too long, but I for one was delighted of the style, combination of simplicity of events and depth of characters and conversation.All in all the The Green Mile is a very touching drama, with the joys and sorrows of the life pictured with great skill, if not the best movie of the year.

This film has an amazing ensemble cast where everybody is working at the top of their game. However, Benicio Del Toro definitely stands out with the breakthrough performance. I don't think it's accidental that the movie begins and ends with shots of him. He plays Javier Rodriguez, a Mexican police officer caught in a futile and corrupt system, and it's as compelling of a character as Michael Corleone. Del Toro is exceptionally relaxed and subtle, keeping his thoughts and feelings private from the other characters in the films, but sharing it with the camera. Del Toro navigates the audience through a world of impossible choices and moral corruption, quietly simmering with intense conflict just beneath the surface. Benicio's been an indie stalwart for years, but this film should shoot his stock through the roof. If there's justice in this world, he'll be rewarded with Best Actor Awards aplenty.Michael Douglas is also terrific, adding another strong performance to his gallery of flawed men in power. He shows genuine fear and vulnerability in a harrowing scene in which he searches for his daughter in a drug dealer's den. I've never seen Erika Christensen before, but she makes an impressive debut. Don Cheadle and Luis Guzman (they should star as a team in every movie!) are as loose, limber and spontaneous as ever, providing plenty of comic relief as well as keeping it real. Catherine Zeta-Jones takes a complete 180 from her past roles and admirably plays against her looks, appearing very pregnant while thrown into gritty surroundings. Dennis Quaid is appropriately slimy as a corrupt lawyer.Anyway, film geeks and anybody else starved for a genuine piece of filmmaking should breathe a sigh of relief and give thanks that Soderbergh has come to save the day.
