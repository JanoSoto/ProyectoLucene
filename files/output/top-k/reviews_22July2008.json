It had new and innovative cinematography techniques and a very complex plot line. It was no doubt one of a kind and is still unrivaled by any other thriller because it is impossible to copy it. Psycho is the exact opposite. Psycho was the first true slasher film, but even more, it was the first thriller\/horror blockbuster. Sure their had been others before it, The cabinet of Dr. Caligari and Frankenstein for example, but none of them hit home the same way that Psycho did. Psycho is a triumph for the common movie watcher. It is a movie that any one can enjoy because it is deceptively simple. Even more than that, however, it is probably one of, if not the, most influential films ever. Many films have tried, unsuccessfully of course, to imitate its one of a kind plot and execution. Any slasher film about a family going to a secluded place and being stalked by an invisible killer can be traced back to psycho. But even with the endless copies and even one remake, no movie has ever captured the horror of Psycho. The Exorcist was a text book grossout film, Jaws was scary for frequent beach goers, and Alien was a horrific movie about our friends from outer space. All three of these don't approach psycho for one reason and one reason alone The Shower Scene. It is hard to still get the full efect of the shower scene because there is so little blood. It is nothing compared to some of the brutal murders from movies such as Last House on the Left. It, however, taps a nerve that no one else has, and that is not from too little effort. No, it is great for one reason and one reason alone, it is a SHOWER scene. This is the reason it is so scary. I could not take a shower with the curtain closed for a week after I saw this movie. The reason it is so scary is because most people in America take a shower at least once a day. Sure Jaws is scary, but some people go there whole life time without going to beach. Everyone takes showers. It is also hard for the average person to realize just how vulnerable they are in the shower. This is the reason why this scene is so powerful. It uses an event that happens in many households every day. This is what sets psycho apart and this is why it is so unique. So, in conclusion, My advise to any slasher film fans is to watch Psycho, love Psycho, worship Psycho.

It was very reminiscent of Three Days of the Condor's, another thriller from Pollack that featured a man on the run from several organizations trying to figure out what's going on. My only complaints are that it feels a little bit too long and it gets pretty convoluted about halfway through.

I had very defined expectations of this film and turned out I was completely wrong in some ways. I had expectations that it would be cheesy, poor quality, bad editing, with monsters and characters that looked like the old dinosaurs from 50's movies and the original King Kong. So as I started to watch it I suddenly realized within the first few minutes that this was much more than I had expected. This was actually a big release in it's time with a decent budget and big backing behind it. The quality of the film was not gritty or poor at all, and the editing (particularly the sound) was as good as any film made during that time. The special effects were actually very well done and the pure violence and power of the film is really quite astounding. There are some great performance that hold the film together, a terrific epic story about vengeance and power, and the film is truly watchable not as an eighties cult classic, but as an actual medieval action flick comparable to anything in it's time. I am however blown away by the amount of IMDb reviewers that talk about this being there favorite film as a kid considering the sheer violence, nudity, and content of the film.Story has it that Arnold Schwarzenegger was still barely stumbling through English sentences when this was made. His dialog is practically non existent and if you're a Schwarzenegger fan from other action films you're going to want to hear that infamous voice more. Still he manages to create a powerful, royal-like character in Conan with sheer strength, body language and look. He's a better actor than people give him credit for and he really tries to show off his stuff in this role. He is heroic but in an almost anti hero way as Conan. Gerry Lopez is terrific as Conan's sidekick Subotai. The two make a great team without every really establishing a bond between them. They work great together and Lopez is terrific as Subotai. Mako adds a little flair to the cast as the Narrator for the first half and then the strange little Wizard from the second half. His character is fun and adds a little something different to the quiet, brooding, muscle ridden cast. Sandahl Bergman is apparently idolized for this role as well as her role in Red Sonja later on. I just think what I read about her kind of over hypes her as this graceful brilliant action heroine and maybe she was for her time because we hadn't seen the likes of Angelina Jolie, Demi Moore, Jody Foster, Xena...and so on who play strong, kick ass woman unapologetically. Bergman is tough and can wield a sword but she still has no problem peeling her clothes off to succumb to her man. Still her character adds the element of a deep romance which is good for the film. The mighty James Earl Jones is magnificent as the downright creepy, disturbing and demented Thulsa Doom. First of all he looks the part and makes you shudder just to see him and that voice and presence commands such a power house performance against Schwarzenegger. He is brilliant and possibly a top movie villain in my opinion.I have to give special mention to director John Milius who seems to really have a knack for writing and directing particularly bleak and powerful worlds (Conan, Red Dawn, Rome) that you are taken aback by the gritty feel to everything around it. I think that the way Conan is described and kept as a classic by people makes one think it's some sort of Indie low budget production when it actually cost as much as any big film during that time...Return of The Jedi, Blade Runner, etc. There are definitely classic moments in the film that you will remember forever including Conan's crucifixion, his battle with the enormous snake, and his battle with Doom himself. There are downsides to the film I think including the lack of character development with Conan and Subotai, the lack of dialog, and the poor choreography on some of the fights that has swords missing their mark by literally feet (ironically saying that Bergman lost her finger during filming by a sword that got too close.)

That too a Non-Hollywood film&#133;&#133;..this curiosity made me choose this film in the middle zone of a sleepless night.As film progress I came to know that how the inferences of the jury become an unanimous one. Let me tell, the story explores the power of laughter to lift the human spirit even in the face of extreme tragedy .No such piece of art has ever before combined laughter and tears of sadness in me before, and that is the miracle of the movie. Thanks to Roberto Beningi(director, main actor and co-writer), who makes me realize that Life is truly Beautiful and that we should be thankful for all that we have through his entirely different and spectacular piece of work . Beningi initially accesses the emotions of his audience through simple comedy and a serious second half. A markable plot in front of me regarding the genocide of Jews before watching this film was the diary of Annie Frank. The story begins in 1939 Italy, where a simple guy who bothers about nothing Jew Guido (Beningi) and his poet friend Ferrucio (Sergio Bini Bustic) have dreams of owning their own bookstore,; . he is continuing the life as a waiter in his Uncle's hotel .Benigni's character is introduced with Dora(Nicoletta Braschi, Benigni's real-life wife) whom he calls Princess following some fast pure comedy tricks, including a school inspecting incident in Dora's school and speaks about racial superiority in front of students and teachers. Guido falls hardly in love with Dora; daughter of a wealthy family Though Dora is engaged to a fascist official, the approach and attitude of Guido wins Dora's heart Guido's approach retrieves her from being the wife of that Fascist official. Through a sequence of dramatic incidents Guido marries Dora. All of the action is so neatly contrived that the film essentially ends when it's over, and then begins again after a few years In 1945, which is the second half of the movieA lovely and charming household atmosphere, Yes Guido's house Now Guido and Dora have a young son; 5 year old Joshua (Giorgio Cantarini) who is bright, loved, and doesn't like to take baths. Guido is now running a book shop everything doing well and fine but things are shattered soon. Nazis take Guido, with little Giosue and his old uncle (Giustino Durano) to an unidentified concentration camp... Though Dora was not picked up for deportation, she chooses to be with her family. When the train unloads at a camp, Guido and Joshua are separated from Dora. Even here, Guido tries to hide the truth from his son. But the truth is plain to the audience - you cry, because you know what is really happening and yet smile through your tears at the stressful effort Guido is making to hide his own fears and tears to make his son charmIt is at this camp that Guido wants protect his son from the nightmare of the place, for that he convinces Joshua by telling that they are here to play a game. The game consists of 1,000 points and the winner gets a real military tank. The rules are made up as time goes on. At one point of time Joshua tells that he is feeling hungry and wants to take food, Guido convinces Joshua telling that taking food in this time may cut short our points and fades our aim of winning the military tank. Hunger was nothing in front of Joshua's urge to win the tank. Guido manages to transform Joshua or deal into what seems like a vacation the only one that is fooled is Joshua, not the audience or Guido. The jokes still come, but the laughs are hardDora is in a separate building and spending the days by reminiscing the sweet past things. Guido used to play a song for his wife while doing the servant life in the camp It was like that; music was their ONLY language then.Guido is a man just trying to cope--to survive, and to protect the life of his son.

I can't really remember anything from that viewing other than the suck-cut part. It wasn't until about three years ago when I finally watched the whole thing for the first time, and while it may not have been as entertaining as I had hoped, it was still fairly amusing. I watched the entire movie for the second time just last night, and I think it was pretty much the same this time.Wayne Campbell is a headbanger who still lives with his parents in Aurora, Illinois and has a whole collection of name tags and hair nets, obviously from previous jobs he has failed to keep. However, he does host a popular public access TV show called Wayne's World from his basement with his best friend, Garth Algar. Their show has been seen by Ben Oliver, a TV executive, who knows how popular it is, and wants to have it on his network. So, Wayne and Garth soon find themselves doing Wayne's World professionally, now on a basement set in a TV station, and it looks like they'll be making a lot of money doing this. However, the two headbanger friends are headed for trouble! They don't realize how sleazy Oliver is at first, and conflict between Wayne and Garth soon arises. In addition to that, Wayne has trouble with his girlfriend, Cassandra (lead singer and bass player of a local band), who may end up with Oliver instead of him if he's not the one who gets her musical career off the ground! Make no mistake, this is a very silly and rather juvenile movie, but silly and juvenile certainly doesn't necessarily mean not funny. Personally, I can't remember exactly how much I laughed the first time, but the second time, I definitely got a good number of laughs, even though it stumbles a bit at times. Wayne and Garth (played by Mike Myers and Dana Carvey) may have trouble staying consistently funny throughout the film's entire runtime (it's obviously harder in a movie than in brief sketches), but for the most part, they succeed, sometimes reasonably funny and sometimes VERY funny, saying some bizarre things. If lines like Turn it off man, turn it off! It's sucking my will to live! Oh, the humanity! amuse you, this could be your kind of movie. Certain minor characters sometimes add humour to the film as well, such as the freaky doughnut shop manager, Glen, played by Ed O'Neill. I also can't forget the beautiful Tia Carrere as Cassandra. With this role, she got to show both her acting and singing skills. Overall, this 1992 hit comedy's highlights are not exactly enough to make it a classic, but if you want silliness and rock music, you'll find plenty of that here.

Taking place in medieval Japan, it is the story of a cursed and exiled young prince involving himself in a war between man and the spirits of nature. The iron-producing town led by the strong Lady Eboshi is pitted against a mysterious young woman running with the wolves. Other cynical players enter the conflict for their own gain.The virtues of this movie are many A largely credible set of ambiguous characters, a grand plot wrapped in a dramatic and moving story, a stunning soundtrack by Joe Hisaishi, an ecological message, as well as Miyazaki's famous attention to detail, which contributes to main as well as back story.The movie has a serious problem, however, which prevents this reviewer from ranking it among their top Studio Ghibli. The protagonist, in sharp contrast to the rest of this movie's ambiguous world, is completely faultless. Prince Ashitaka has got to be one of the most boring characters ever encountered in storytelling. Despite all his trials, he is never more angry than required, always courageous, kind, and ready to help. This deprives the story vastly of its sophistication.It is, nevertheless, possible to interpret this as another virtue. By seeing San and Lady Eboshi as the real protagonists, you can say Ashitaka is really a metaphor for new and progressive thought, the emergence of which makes it possible to mitigate deep conflicts. But whether or not Miyazaki intended it this way, it is hard to say whether such an interpretation is shared by the fanbase. Also, the movie strongly pushes Ashitaka as the protagonist, not encouraging the alternative interpretation.Also, keep some distance from the English dub. There are two reasons. First, Neil Gaiman, writer of the dub script, obviously saw Miyazaki's own sense of humour as insufficient, and decided to add some dialogue jokes on his own where the animation allows it - rather poor jokes. Second, Claire Danes' rendition of San is a painful experience. She makes the brave warrior princess sound like a whiny teenage girl, so much like those familiar to readers of Robert Jordan. Billy Crudup is not really helping either - his temperless voice adds to Ashitaka's infuriating lack of character.In short Whether this is a good or a great movie really depends on your interpretation.

It is, rather, a movie that you might say that wasn't that scary upon finishing it, but you won't want to think about for very long after you turn out the lights and attempt to go to sleep. It is easy to watch but sets a very creepy mood and may make you wonder what's really outside your tent next time you go camping.Overall I thought it was a pretty good movie. On one hand they could have made it a little scarier but on the other, had they made the scares less subtle it might have come off as cheesy or corny, and I'm pretty satisfied with the way it is.

Instead, it was very subtle with the scares, yet creepy and suspenseful, and has you thinking (along with the characters) what the hell is going on? The film builds fairly slowly, but it's interesting. They set up the plot-line with some back story\/myths about the blair witch, enough that you can figure out what's happening later on in the movie when you think back on it.The actors, I felt, gave very good and believable performances, as tensions built up throughout the movie.The movie culminates in a climax that is not terrifying, but is suspenseful and creepy, and leaves you with an overall movie experience that I would consider to be chilling.This is not a movie that you will watch and say That was so scary! It is, rather, a movie that you might say that wasn't that scary upon finishing it, but you won't want to think about for very long after you turn out the lights and attempt to go to sleep. It is easy to watch but sets a very creepy mood and may make you wonder what's really outside your tent next time you go camping.Overall I thought it was a pretty good movie. On one hand they could have made it a little scarier but on the other, had they made the scares less subtle it might have come off as cheesy or corny, and I'm pretty satisfied with the way it is. It's a fun movie to watch with your buddies when you're just hanging out and feel like watching a movie in the dark (it helps if you're sleeping in a camper as me and my friend were last night). I give it an 8\/10.

It is my all time favorite movie and the newer remake will never replace it, even if the remake is just OK. The movie is about when the crazy candy maker, Willy Wonka sends out 5 Golden Tickets for a chance to win a tour through his amazing candy factory, run by the mysterious green-haired, orange-faced Oompa Loompa elves, and also win a lifetime supply of chocolate. The children who find them are a spoiled brat named Veruca Salt, a loudmouthed TV addict named Mike Teevee, gumchewer Violet Beauregard, gluttonous Augustus Gloop, and Charlie Bucket--a poor boy who lives with his mom and 4 bedridden grandparents in small house. 4 of the children get their demise thanks to their usual behavior, except for Charlie, and is promised to win a lifetime supply of chocolate, but is almost not given it because he and his Grandpa Joe broke one of Wonka's rules by drinking Fizzy lifting drinks and almost getting chopped to bits by a fan on the ceiling and dirtying it when they bumped into it. However, after Wonka dismisses Charlie and Grandpa Joe, Charlie gives back the Everlasting Gobstopper candy that he gave each of the kids earlier. The gobstopper was Wonka's most secret recipe and he finds out that he passed Mr. Wonka's test of honesty and is given the factory because Mr. Wonka couldn't work there forever, and he wanted to find an honest loving child who can be told all of Wonka's most precious candymaking secrets, and take care of the Oompa Loompas. My favorite parts are when Grandpa Joe does his victory dance I've Got a Golden Ticket, surprisingly after being bedridden for 20 years, when Charlie finds the ticket and runs home, the psychedelic boat trip, Augustus Gloop falling into the chocolate river, Violet Beauregarde turning into a blueberry thanks to some very special gum, the group first seeing the Chocolate Room, (while Mr. Wonka sings Pure Imagination) when Mr. Wonka leads the group through the beginning of the factory (MR. SALT--Is this some kind of funhouse? WONKA Why, having fun?) the Wonkawash scene and the very end, when Charlie, Grandpa Joe, and Willy are in the Wonkavator. I know I have more but that's all I can think of. All I can say is, this movie is pure magic, and full of pure imagination, for young and old. So what if it doesn't have fancy computer effects like the 2005 remake? This movie is all real. The 1971 version will always be the best to me, because it's simple, fantastic, magic, funny, and Gene Wilder IS Willy Wonka. Maybe this version isn't true to the book like the 2005 version but this version is special in it's own way. It will remain my favorite movie of all time, with The Muppet Movie probably being second on my list. To end my review, I will say my favorite(and final) line from this movie. Don't forget what happened to the man who suddenly got everything he always wanted&#151;he lived happily ever after. That line sums up the sheer brilliance and innocence (OK maybe a few parts are a little dark and scary) of Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.

I am a huge Superman fan and to have a movie like this representing my favorite superhero is astounding.This is a great movie because of the great mix of fantasy, drama, action and the care taken in presenting this classic story with what Richard Donner called Verisimilitude--the appearance of being true or real; likeness or resemblance of the truth. Even though this is a fictional story they treat it with a sense of reality and truth. They respect this American Icon that has been a part of our culture for many years and will continue to endure.As a kid I was astounded at seeing my hero flying freely through the air--catching Lois Lane as she falls from the helicopter, watching him rescue Air Force One from crashing, chasing rockets, saving California from falling into the ocean and even taking the time to do the little things like rescuing a cat from a tree. I remember the excitement as Clark Kent first appeared as Superman, running across the street and ripping open his shirt to reveal that famous S. It was my comic book fantasy brought to life.When I got older, I still feel those things but I noticed so much more. Chris Reeve totally embodies this character with such grace and charisma that I don't see an actor in a blue suit and red cape, I see Superman and Clark Kent. The way he portrays both characters is totally distinct. Watch the scene after Superman drops Lois Lane off at her balcony and then Clark Kent arrives to take her out. When he takes off his glasses and almost reveals himself to her as the dashing superhero you can see the change take place and believe why no one can penetrate his disguise. Look at the reactions of people as they see Superman in action, the awe he inspires. Chris made that believable--he is Superman.The movie itself is a masterpiece; the script is well written and conceived. Richard Donner brings us movie that sparks the imagination and makes you enjoy the ride from start to finish. Mario Puzo gave him a great script to work with and Tom Mankiewicz added the final touches to make it the best it could be. All the actors brought their characters to life in a way that makes you care and believe. Great care was taken in each of the 3 acts of this movie from Krypton to Smallville to Metropolis. Each world has a unique look and feel of their own and help to bring the story to life and build Kal-El into Clark Kent and finally to Superman. The world of Krypton is beautiful and majestic, we get a great yet brief look into the home world of the Man of Steel and learn of the destruction that brought him to Earth. In Smallville we see where Clark's humanity and compassion come from in the form of Jonathan and Martha Kent, his adoptive parents and where Clark learns that his destiny begins to call him to something greater. After his journey to the frozen north and his tutelage in the Fortress of Solitude from Jor-El he learns to embrace his destiny and become the greatest hero the world has ever known. Then we hit Metropolis, BAM, comic book come to life. From there we follow the adventures of Clark and his new found alter ego as he brings his amazing powers to the aid of the people of Earth.Marlon Brando was a perfect choice for Jor-El. He fit the role like a glove and had a very commanding presence without being overpowering. He was a great father figure and role model for Kal-El. He instilled the qualities that would allow Kal-El to embrace his heritage and become the symbol of hope for Earth, the light to show the way. Phyllis Thaxter and Glenn Ford were terrific as Clark's adoptive parents. They gave him humanity and always made him feel loved and accepted no matter how different their son felt. They didn't care where he came from they loved him and knew that he would be a great influence on his adopted home world.Margot Kidder was brilliant as Lois. She captured the tenacity and toughness of the character as well as the googly-eyed, love struck girl she becomes around Superman so well. She was tough and smart and took charge. Around Clark she is very confident and a bit constructively critical. Around Superman she loses all of that and becomes a lovesick little kid who dreams of the shining knight in a red cape. Plus, she has the absolutely brilliant knack of getting into situations that only Superman can pull her out of.Lex Luthor, brought to life in the most astounding way by Gene Hackman. Brilliant, menacing, criminal genius bent on committing the biggest real estate scam on Earth and not caring who he hurts along the way. He is menacing without being scary, he's confidant yet bored with the ease he can outwit and outdo anyone he comes across. Then comes Superman, the adversary he's been waiting for. It's not an obstacle for him, it's a challenge.As far as musical scores go, you can't get any better than John Williams. His theme for Superman still gives me chills as I hear it during the main titles or while Superman is in action. It fits the character perfectly and gives the greatest hero his greatest theme that is exciting and inspiring.Visually, emotionally, and fantasy fulfilling this movie has it all. It's a magical, cinematic journey for young and old alike and will endure the test of time. It's inspirational, it helps us to believe that Superman is out there in some fashion to help us.

","genre":"Action, Adventure, Drama"},{"date":"22 July 2008","score":"","review":" Creepshow should be heralded, if for no other reason, that it does precisely what the film makers wanted it to do. It's an incredibly dark, comical, violent, blood soaked disturbing collection of horror shorts that you would expect from two writers like the incomparable Stephen King (the greatest writer of the 21st century in my opinion) and zombie legend George A. Romero who directs the whole thing. Creepshow is the furthest thing from serious you could possibly get. The entire thing is a complete lark and yet is so disturbing at the same time. All five stories are the type of stories you would kill to hear around the campfire. Bring in a cast of really terrific actors and you've got 2 hours of a good time watching these stories unfold. Being the early eighties the film pulls no punches when it comes to gut wrenching horror and blood splattering like crazy and profanity spewing from their mouths. That being said the stories do get better as they go and by the last story (which is one of the best) you are chilled to the bone. Since I don't usually review anthologies like this I will break them down into sections.Father's Day---Not the best story but kind of sets up the type of situation you're in for. No particularly stand out performances in the crowd but a really creepy zombie in the form of the father back to exact revenge for not getting his cake. Also check for a young Ed Harris as well who looks great! The Lonesome Death of Jordy Verrill---This one is kind of becoming one of my favorites and most of that is due to the one man show that is the master of horror himself Stephen King. His performance is deliciously over the top, hilarious and disturbing, and just the entire skit is him dealing with touching some sort of meteor juice and waiting for his impending death. King holds this one together all by himself and it's a classic not to be missed!! Something To Tide You Over---One of the more serious skits of the film and one of the best acted too. Leslie Nielsen in a...deadly...serious role as a scorned rich husband who seeks to exact revenge on his wife and her lover. Nielsen is brilliant and devilishly disturbing. His final words of the film still ring out I can hold my breath a long, long time. Ted Danson is also terrific as the lover Harry Wentworth who looks awesome back from the dead as a zombie. Same with his co-star Gaylen Ross even though she gets very little lines as an actual person. A classic segment!! The Crate---I thought this portion was more Stephen King than any of the other ones. It felt so much like a creation of his mind. It's tense and disturbing and although I thought the monster from this segment was the poorest of all the effects in the film, there was some great performances. Hal Holbrook is terrific as day dreaming tired husband Henry who is at the end of his rope with his drunken, annoying, screechy wife Wilma played with terrific satire by legendary actress Adrienne Barbeau. Fritz Weaver is also really great, one of the best performances as Dexter Stanley, the crazed finder of the monster in the crate. Out of all of them The Crate is Stephen King at his best.Finally you'll be left feeling creeped out and brushing yourself off with They're Creeping Up On You---This is the shortest of all the films I believe but really hits home and closes the series very well. Veteran actor E.G. Marshall is amazing as germophobe and business tycoon\/monster Upson Pratt. He lives in a disturbing apartment of solitude, sealed, and protected from any germ or bug as he rules his companies with an iron first via an electronic phone panel. Basically as you might guess this segment is about bugs, so many bugs that Pratt will be completely taken by them. Now whether or not the bugs exist or they are a figment of his disturbed mind is for you to decide but even if bugs don't bother you...you'll get a shudder.Horror fans can't not see this classic collection of stories. I mean everything just sort of ends like a good ghost story novel but the brilliant hand made special effects, the truly terrific cast, the direction of a master and the writing of the King of Horror (not to mention an amazing performance) will leave you begging for more Creepshow.

The darkest comical film I've ever seen possibly. 8\/10 ","genre":"Comedy, Fantasy, Horror"},{"date":"22 July 2008","score":"","review":" Creepshow should be heralded, if for no other reason, that it does precisely what the film makers wanted it to do. It's an incredibly dark, comical, violent, blood soaked disturbing collection of horror shorts that you would expect from two writers like the incomparable Stephen King (the greatest writer of the 21st century in my opinion) and zombie legend George A. Romero who directs the whole thing. Creepshow is the furthest thing from serious you could possibly get. The entire thing is a complete lark and yet is so disturbing at the same time. All five stories are the type of stories you would kill to hear around the campfire. Bring in a cast of really terrific actors and you've got 2 hours of a good time watching these stories unfold. Being the early eighties the film pulls no punches when it comes to gut wrenching horror and blood splattering like crazy and profanity spewing from their mouths. That being said the stories do get better as they go and by the last story (which is one of the best) you are chilled to the bone. Since I don't usually review anthologies like this I will break them down into sections.Father's Day---Not the best story but kind of sets up the type of situation you're in for. No particularly stand out performances in the crowd but a really creepy zombie in the form of the father back to exact revenge for not getting his cake. Also check for a young Ed Harris as well who looks great! The Lonesome Death of Jordy Verrill---This one is kind of becoming one of my favorites and most of that is due to the one man show that is the master of horror himself Stephen King. His performance is deliciously over the top, hilarious and disturbing, and just the entire skit is him dealing with touching some sort of meteor juice and waiting for his impending death. King holds this one together all by himself and it's a classic not to be missed!! Something To Tide You Over---One of the more serious skits of the film and one of the best acted too. Leslie Nielsen in a...deadly...serious role as a scorned rich husband who seeks to exact revenge on his wife and her lover. Nielsen is brilliant and devilishly disturbing. His final words of the film still ring out I can hold my breath a long, long time. Ted Danson is also terrific as the lover Harry Wentworth who looks awesome back from the dead as a zombie. Same with his co-star Gaylen Ross even though she gets very little lines as an actual person. A classic segment!! The Crate---I thought this portion was more Stephen King than any of the other ones. It felt so much like a creation of his mind. It's tense and disturbing and although I thought the monster from this segment was the poorest of all the effects in the film, there was some great performances.

It has everything I like in it. Great plot, characters, action, acting, script, cinematography, direction and of course the locations. This film has combined all these aspects into a monster of a movie.The plot is great as it has narrative but only gives you what Sam (De Niro) knows about what he's doing. The audience is purposefully being kept at arms length so that they are constantly thinking about what is coming next? What does this mean? And of course the most important question, what is in the case? The plot itself is not overly complex. An Irish separatist group want a case which is being sold to the Russian Mafia and they hire spies, who no longer have jobs since the Cold War, ended to get it for them. However the relationships between characters and the plot twists make for a movie that is filled with intrigue and themes. So the plot ranks at 8\/10.The script is very solid. It is a no nonsense script which contains good lines from different cultures. It has American sayings, British phrases, Irish mannerisms, French touches and even a little bit of a German directness for the appropriate characters. It has some good interactions in it. Vincent and Sam have some of the best exchanges, as do Sam and Spence (Bean). Script gets a rating of 9\/10.The characters don't seem complex at first but they are very different and very three-dimensional. Each character seems to have am untold back story that has made them who they are. The relationship between the characters counts for a lot especially the ones between Sam, Deirdre (McElhorne) and Vincent (Reno). So the characters rate at 8\/10 as well.It has a unique cast the likes of which rivals 'Heat'. De Niro, Reno, Skarsgard, Bean, McElhorne, Price and Lonsdale are some of the best in the business and they are all on the top of their game in this picture. To give you an idea of what to expect I regard the scenes where it is just Reno and De Niro to be ten times better than Paccino and De Niro in 'Heat' (which is arguably the greatest Thriller\/action movie ever made). Lonsdale is the icing on the cake of this films cast, Reno, De Niro and Skarsgard provide most of the cake ingredients, but Lonsdale is just class. So the Cast is 10\/10 Frankenheimer achieved perfect acting with his cast as well as brilliantly composed shots done with Robert Fraisse and a good challenging narrative. The car chases surpass the racing scenes from his 'Grand Prix' and there is some of the best acting we have seen from one of his casts in this film. 10\/10 for him as well.Each shot in this film is a work of art. The smooth steady-cam shots, the perfect composition of the close ups when introducing the characters and the various shots achieved during the car chase scenes all look fantastic. The cinematographer Robert Fraisse did a fantastic job working with the very visual John Frankenheimer, who never received the plaudits he deserved. 10\/10 for the photography.The action is immense. The gunfights and car chases all look sublime. No CGI in the action sequences either it's either stunt men or the actors and its looks so fluid. The car chases make ever other car chase seem obsolete and the gunfights aren't half bad either. But the car chases are the high point of the action of the film and must be seen to be believed. The action gets a 10\/10 rating from me. The locations in Paris, Nice and Arles add a subliminal beauty to the film. The helicopter shots give the audience a nice view of the brilliant architecture and charm of French cities. The layout of the cities also makes the car chases interesting, as the streets are very narrow and filled with sharp turns. The look of the buildings does the most for the films look though. The stone buildings give a sense of age that goes along with the retired intelligence officers. This is the first Hollywood action movie to be shot in France and special rights were given to the crew so that the film industry in France would boom. The locations collect a solid 10\/10.Due to all these factors Ronin becomes a classic espionage film that will be difficult to surpass. The car chases are truly phenomenal. This is a must see film.

At first it seems that the medicines alter Alice's perception, but only in her mind. Spoiler Alert! If you don't want to know what happens stop reading now. But as the events progress we begin to get the impression that perhaps the magic is not just in her mind. In one particularly funny office Xmas Party scene, Alice is spying on her cheating husband (William Hurt) who is entwined with one of his romances. His girl friend says it feels as if they are being watched. Then Alice, who has used some herbal medicine that made her invisible, becomes visible and the paramour screams. Her husband's biggest concern at that point seems to be how Alice was able to sneak into the office. Another funny moment is the Xmas party at her sister's home. A love potion that Alice puts down temporarily because she hasn't yet decided on whether to use it on her unfaithful husband or on her divorced boy friend who wants to return to his ex-wife. After all the men at the party begin declaring their love for Alice, she finds out that a servant had added it to the eggnog thinking it was nutmeg. Maybe this is a somewhat stale situation-comedy bit, but Woody does it so much better than the others. In every Woody Allen film that I remember, with the possible exception of Purple Rose of Cairo, if Woody is not part of the cast then one of the characters has neurotic mannerisms that imitate Woody's screen persona. But those actors somehow miss what make those mannerisms funny. In Alice, Mia Farrow is given those Woodyish lines. She makes it work! She plays a female Woody Allen neurotic perfectly!

At first it seems that the medicines alter Alice's perception, but only in her mind. Spoiler Alert! If you don't want to know what happens stop reading now. But as the events progress we begin to get the impression that perhaps the magic is not just in her mind. In one particularly funny office Xmas Party scene, Alice is spying on her cheating husband (William Hurt) who is entwined with one of his romances. His girl friend says it feels as if they are being watched. Then Alice, who has used some herbal medicine that made her invisible, becomes visible and the paramour screams. Her husband's biggest concern at that point seems to be how Alice was able to sneak into the office. Another funny moment is the Xmas party at her sister's home. A love potion that Alice puts down temporarily because she hasn't yet decided on whether to use it on her unfaithful husband or on her divorced boy friend who wants to return to his ex-wife. After all the men at the party begin declaring their love for Alice, she finds out that a servant had added it to the eggnog thinking it was nutmeg. Maybe this is a somewhat stale situation-comedy bit, but Woody does it so much better than the others. In every Woody Allen film that I remember, with the possible exception of Purple Rose of Cairo, if Woody is not part of the cast then one of the characters has neurotic mannerisms that imitate Woody's screen persona. But those actors somehow miss what make those mannerisms funny. In Alice, Mia Farrow is given those Woodyish lines. She makes it work! She plays a female Woody Allen neurotic perfectly!

The story centers upon a bright, intelligent man Derek Vinyard, played by Edward Norton, who unyieldingly displays his hate and disgust for other races. He and his group of friends repeatedly make life difficult for other races living in the area. Their actions finally climax when Derek goes too far and has to serve time in prison, leaving his younger brother, Danny Vinyard, played by Edward Furlong, to the will of the Neo-Nazi group. The story is powerful and features ups and downs in the characters that add an air of humanity to these otherwise inhumane Neo-Nazi racists. The characters, for the most part, are grotesque and in certain cases, utmost embodiments of our own insecurities towards different cultures and lifestyles, initiating inner turmoil sometimes. The film sometimes plays off these fears a little too much and does not offer them in a more objective and subtle way.The film takes place in a surreal setting where there is constant conflict between differing races. The focus here is on tensions between the Neo-Nazis and African-Americans living in the same neighborhood, and at times the film tends to become a little one-sided. It feels like some of the targets of Derek's horrific actions are simply victims, when in the grand scheme of things, they likely harbor similar feelings towards Derek's group and commit similar actions in retribution. Moreover, Derek's transformation in prison is brushed over rather quickly and uses one or two powerful scenes to imply a lifetime of change. It doesn't really work honestly and the film loses a lot of its credibility there.The acting here is decent with Edward Norton standing head and shoulders above the rest of the cast. Danny Vinyard, despite arguably being the main character, seems like he's missing in certain scenes when Norton simply takes over. Edward Furlong does look the part but he doesn't act the part extremely well. Having said that, he does a decent enough job to propel the film forward, even with his annoying monologues that lack any spirit. The rest of the cast does well with what its given with Ethan Suplee playing Derek's leach-like and terrifying friend. Even William Russ makes a strong guest appearance in a flashback sequence that explains many of the present scenarios.The visual style is interesting here with color scenes meant to represent Derek's changed lifestyle in the present, and stark black-and-white shots used in flashback sequences to juxtapose the two races against one another. The idea, while pretty good on paper, ends up coming on a little too strong in the film, and does end up hurting the film, even though it tries to add depth. There are several haunting scenes here that the camera crew has taken from the script and captured well in film. The score is mostly two-sided, using dark and low notes for the past, and higher pitched notes to indicate a possible, brighter future. It works pretty well but like the difference in color and black-and-white, it sometimes goes for too much, especially towards the end of the film.American History X is a film about racism that is meant to inspire disgust for those portrayed on screen but also perhaps in ourselves when we sometimes shelter similar feelings. The film is literally a little too black and white, offering little gray space between, on the topic of racism. Unfortunately, certain things aren't always as simple as the film makes them out to be and Derek's transformation is both too unrealistic and short. Edward Norton does an incredible job here but the rest of the cast members, with a few exceptions, suffer greatly, and consequently, so does the film. Overall, the film sends out a powerful message, using powerful camera shots and characters to deliver it to the audience. It is grisly and gritty at times, giving us an extreme and bitter taste of Neo-Nazi racism. However, the film has too many flaws in its execution for it to be considered a classic of 90's cinema.
