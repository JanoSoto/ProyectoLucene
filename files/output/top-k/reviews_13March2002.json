Once in a while there are screenwriters and\/or directors who really want to do something extraordinary to impress the viewers of their production. As an example, Groundhog Day had the main character relive the same day over and over again for ages until he finally got the girl of his dreams in the end, and it worked. Fight Club also gave you an intense story where two very different characters slowly evolved to a movie climax rarely seen, because to most people the answer to all the story's conflicts is to unimaginable. A closer example to Memento is The Usual Suspects from 1994, which gave you a very exciting story set in the criminal underworld run by Kayzer Zose, a man everybody fears but no one knows who he is...a lot like the main character in Memento.The story is about insurance investigator Leonard, who suffers from short-term memory loss. Leonard got injured after intervening on his wife's murder. The murderer was still there when Leonard walked in on them, thus the main character ended up with a cracked skull (figuratively speaking).The movie's opening scene is where most crime stories would end; the main character gets his wife's murderer. The rest of the movie is built upon the fragments of memories that led Leonard getting his guy, in other words this movie is kind of told backwards, starting from the mentioned opening scene and ending where the whole situation actually begun... sound confusing? Well, I was confused for about fifteen minutes but once I understood what was going on the rest was just pure genius. At one point I asked myself How can a story told backwards actually get more exciting by the minute? As much as I would give you some information about this, you really have to see the movie for yourself to actually understand what a gem this really is. The tension curve is always rising, with an ending so surprisingly good that this movie is up there with stunners like aforementioned The Usual Suspects and Fight Club.This is a totally unmissable movie for lovers of the crime\/mystery genre.

This is a romance film about two individuals who, whilst both in perfectly-good-but-not-quite-perfect relationships with other people, take a fancy to a random stranger they meet in a department store one evening and so spend the rest of the night flirting outrageously like a cheap tart with them.This done, off they both go to continue their extant relationships. Unfortunately, instead of realising that they could do better and bringing the relationships to a neat end, they only decide to make a run for it on the eves of their coincident weddings. How serendipitous.We then have the pleasure of watching them each drag their best friends (one of whom's marriage is destroyed in the process) across the planet in order to try and find their once-potential philanderer, whilst their nice bride\/groom stands rather forlornly alone at the altar. As any plot line following the jilted spouses is abandoned at this point, I am surmising that they were stood up. Perhaps they died. Who cares.Man finds girl, some snow falls, some kissing ensues and our happy couple realise that the forty-five minutes they spent together in a restaurant six months ago are more than enough to base their everlasting happiness on. Audience feel warm and fuzzy inside. Speaking for myself, I was certainlyclose to tears.The idea that this film could be billed as a romantic comedy is quite extraordinary. Certainly, the leading characters appear to share the moral outlook of a badger on heat and in that respect I'm very glad they managed to find a like-minded mate.

Its all about the getting there, and then when it does get there the gotten only serves to compliment the getting. Yes, there is a        mystery, and yes it is solved, but this only further complicates the characters and their relationships to one another. The revelation of the mystery only affords a greater mystery. So, in all actuality, the ending is only the place where the movie ends and the credits begin. How Gosford Park is all this and still manages to be satisfying is, perhaps, the greatest mystery of all.The plot of Gosford Park is entirely to complex to be neatly tidied up here, besides anything less than a full script would be superficial. I will say, however, that it concerns a massive group of impossibly rich characters, invited to a          party circa November 1932. Nearly all of these are restricted to the upstairs (aristocrats) and downstairs (servants). The first half of the film would seem to show the differences between these, but then, ironically, someone is       ed and the film takes the opposite turn. Suddenly, each of these people are all just people, and the only thing dividing them is a set of stairs and musty ideals. Each group is, after all, made up of individuals put in their place solely by chance. In the end everyone has their own specific problems and concerns, that may or may not relate to their class, and are often either paralleled or mingled with the opposite class.Do these themes resolve the movie? Well, yes and no. In the end the        is irrelevant, and could have been substituted by any similar scandal or tragedy. It is the characters that matter. We never really find out just who everyone is, but that, the mystery left unsolved, may be the point of the movie. Gosford Park is at first all about surfaces, every character begins a caricature. However, gradually we realize that there is something never completely disclosed going on beneath the surface. Sure there are little revelations throughout, but all they really tell us is that each character is more than meets the eye. In an exact reversal of typical narrative, the characters start out simple and accessible, but end complex and mysterious. So their plights are never really resolved, they may still come away a little bit wiser for their visit.All of this is made rich by cunning direction, lush photography, and impossibly wonderful performances. That director Robert Altman (M*A*S*H, Nashville) manages to drag a brilliant performance out every every member of his whopping 23-character cast is, well, like I said... impossible. But then again Altman really doesn't seem to give a damn. He is one of the most talented directors of our age, and he puts that talent to good use here. He knows the tricks of his trade very well. He can make any character an         , a suspect, and all with the angle of his camera. And how he handles that cast...!Speaking of which, it would take entirely to much text to detail the performances of each main character, as there are so many of them. However, there are two female performances that stand out, and seem to be garnering special attention. Maggie Smith is a show-stealer. She is so wonderfully bitchy and disdainful in her role, really giddy to behold. She manages to teeter perfectly between being a part of her class, and absolutely contemptuous of it. Then, in the opposite light is Helen Mirren. A servant, her performance is composed of subtle glances which tell us just enough of her bitterness, cynicism, and ultimate love, without completely revealing her. She is ultimately very sad, and she suppresses and reveals that sadness in just the right way. Altman openly claimed his film to be greatly influenced by the classic French film, La Regle Du Jeu, a very similar study of social classes. Does this detract from the film's originality? Not really. Upstairs-Downstairs movies are really a genre all their own. Antiwar films, interracial love stories, teen angst dramas and other specific types of movies all may express very similar themes, but they can also be very unique. Gosford Park expresses the universal ideas of La Regle, but in a different manner. It lifts the themes and settings of the earlier film, and populates them with many different characters, and situations. The tone is different as well...In Gosford Park Altman takes a very sly, farcical approach to his material. When watching it I got the feeling that he was like a kid throwing rocks into a busy anthill. His        is his greatest rock, and one the ants spend a great deal of time figuring out how to approach. Should they swarm all over it, stand aside and laugh scornfully, hide away, or blame each other? Altman's ants all take a different approach.

And while it's nice to see a film that doesn't milk its gags for more than they're worth, at least that would be a fault on the right side.  Some of the comic ideas are just begging to be WALLOWED in.  For example (I'm going to end up recommending this film, so if you don't want its best sight gag ruined, for God's sake skip the next paragraph)...One of the radio serials is about an aristocratic English explorer and his native jungle sidekick.  We hear the former saying things like `What ho, I mean to say, steady on, old chap', while the latter is going, `Ooga booga - me mongo mongo man' - then we see that the African is being played by a dopey-looking white man, and the Englishman is being played by a black (in a tuxedo).

A couple of weeks ago I bought it on DVD and couldn't stop telling myself that it is probably one of the best movies I've ever seen.First of all, the story. Although it's rather simple (The search for a kidnapped girl by bounty hunters) it is still well worked in various aspects such as amalgamating the classical vampire story with a post-Apocalyptic future, two plot lines very difficult to combine, yet it has been done in a marvelous way.Then the characters. Since it's an anime, the entire work of giving life to a character is entirely at the hands of the director and the artists, while a lesser weight is put by the dubbing cast. I am not trying to take credit from the dubbing cast since their work is very, very good (I can't stop laughing every time I hear the voice of the Old Barbaroi while the expression put into Leila's and Left Hand's voice is not even voice but PURE FEELING). As I said, the work done by the crew in everything that involved CHARACTER AND PSYCHOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT is the best I've ever seen in any animes, sadly even better than the great Lupin III. By the end of the film you won't have any doubts on the characters and it will seem to you as if you've known them for your whole life.The animation....by far the best I've experienced. I cannot describe it with words, since nothing would make justice to it, but in case you have had the luck to see the film I'm sure that scenes such as the attack to the Barbarois by Grove and the SUPERB arrow sequence (This I believe to be the finest scene I've ever seen on an anime feature) of the graveyard have been stuck in your head since then.Again, the characters are extremely done. The idea of inserting Left Hand's character (Although the parasite has been there since the first Vampire Hunter D) is excellent since it gives someone the chance to say certain phrases (She's out of her mind!, The spirit of Carmilla!) without which lots of tension and action would be inevitably lost.And finally, the soundtrack. Mr D'Ambrosio with few simple notes has given a soundtrack to the anime like few I'd ever listened to before a march as the Markus Borther's theme, Carmilla's Theme (Regina della Notte) and a few trumpets to introduce the grandia of D to the public are few examples of the magnificiency of this composer, who, if he has the luck and keeps it up will become the next John Williams or Ennio Morricone.I suppose the best words that can describe this film are the ones by Derek Elley for Variety, who says ...a visual poetry that's refreshing.This film is in fact, pure poetry.

It would better have stayed on the shelves, for later revision or for eventual placement into the dustbin. Recently I read that the script had been re-written several times and that most of the movie was re-made because Disney was not happy with it. So what what we see now is the second or third trial, that for one reason or another was released.  The main problem with this movie is -as said- that there simply is no strong story line. It is a collection of events, some of which are funny but most not funny at all. Nowadays Disney makes two or three movies a year, whereas in the past he made one in every two or three years. Maybe that is the main problem. The show must go on and on, with more and more output. So see it, if you are a Disney fan, but don't buy it.

For me this is John Travolta's best movie by far. He is perfect. I grew up in Brooklyn and have had many experiences with people who were in the mob. Many people have played very good tough guys in the movies, but Travolta's performance was the best I have ever seen. Gene Hackman was great. Without him this would have been a good movie, but he made it a great movie. Harry Zimm is one of the all time great movie characters and he fit like a glove with Travolta. Rene Russo and Danny DeVito also gave great performances but Dennis Farina, Delroy Lindo, and James Gandolfini gave the best performances of their lives. Watching these people having fun with this gem of a movie was one of the best movie experiences I ever had. Like the film Player this movie has fun with the Hollywood condition, but the actors in Get Shorty make it something really special. If you ever wanted to be in film or if you like great acting, look at me, see Get Shorty.

For me this is John Travolta's best movie by far. He is perfect. I grew up in Brooklyn and have had many experiences with people who were in the mob. Many people have played very good tough guys in the movies, but Travolta's performance was the best I have ever seen. Gene Hackman was great. Without him this would have been a good movie, but he made it a great movie. Harry Zimm is one of the all time great movie characters and he fit like a glove with Travolta. Rene Russo and Danny DeVito also gave great performances but Dennis Farina, Delroy Lindo, and James Gandolfini gave the best performances of their lives.

Being a big fan of the original POA film & TV series (& cartoons), I was looking forward to this film, though with some apprehension. I kind of enjoyed the parallels to the originals Get your stinking paws off me, you damn, dirty human! My favorite was C. Heston Damn them...Damn them all to Hell! and of course, he had a gun in his room.While watching this film, I had a problem with almost everything. From the gigantic halls of the space craft to the pathetic sound stage of Ape City. Don't you think that by the 22nd century, people who work with primates would figure out the difference between apes & monkeys? How many USAF captains would disobey a direct order from a 4-star general by flying out into danger? Probably half of the ape actors really walked correctly (as an ape's pelvis would allow). It sure was great that the spaceship worked after so many thousand years. Boy, they don't make 'em like that anymore. At least the apes bungee jumping around didn't look as pathetic as Crouching Tiger.I still can't tell if this was supposed to be a serious sci-fi drama or a spoof on the original. I guess I should have guessed what was in store when I saw in the opening credits Based on A novel by Pierre Boule and not Based on THE novel by Pierre Boule.On the plus side, Helena Carter was excellent, the ape costumes were fantastic and the cinematography was very good. However, they didn't save the movie or the world. Avoid this film unless you are a hopeless Apes fan...like me.
