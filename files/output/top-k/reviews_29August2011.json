Musician Manny Balestrero (Henry Fonda) gets picked up on armed robbery charges but he's innocent of the crime. Some strange evidence, including a couple eye witnesses, ends him up on trial without much hope for any type of acquittal while his wife (Vera Miles) slowly cracks under the pressure. When people talk about the classic Alfred Hitchcock movies they mention stuff like VERTIGO, REAR WINDOW, PSYCHO and of course NORTH BY NORTHWEST. It seems that the director simply has so many classics that many of his other films simply get lost in the crowd and that's certainly the case with THE WRONG MAN. This is such a good film with some really great performances and a rather scary situation that it's hard to believe that it's been overlooked since it was first released. I think what works so well is the way Hitchcock films it as if it was a documentary. The director makes his cameo right at the start of the film when he addresses the viewers and lets them know that this film is based on a real event. Having the director address the viewer this way brings a very serious tone to the film and this corrupt atmosphere hangs over the film from start to finish. Fonda was the perfect choice to play this role because, needless to say, the actor was always terrific at playing your everyday man and someone that the audience could connect with. Fonda really does a remarkable job in the role and just check out the scene where the innocent man sees what it's like behind bars for the first time. Just watch Fonda's eyes as the door opens and it finally hits him that he's in some major trouble. Miles is also quite good in her role but I think the screenplay let her down in a way but more on that later. Anthony Quayle is wonderful as Fonda's attorney and Harold J. Stone is also very good in his role as the lead detective. Bernard Herrmann offers up a terrific score that really puts you in the mind frame of the Fonda character and the director perfectly uses it to build up tension as the film goes along. It was well known that Hitchcock had a fear of the police and you have to think that he wanted to make this film because he could feel the terror of being falsely accused of something and even though you're innocent there's simply no way to prove it other than you're a good person. Hitchcock really nails this from start to finish and one can't help but get caught up in the story. I think the one weak thing is what ends up happening to the wife as she has a nervous breakdown from all the stress. This happened in real life but I think this could have been one of the changes that Hollywood made to the story. The stuff with the wife happens in a short period of time and it's not given enough attention to be believable and what little screen time it does get just takes the focus away from the main story. With that said, it's a shame that THE WRONG MAN has been overlooked for all these years because it shows the director and the star at the top of their games.

There should probably be a list somewhere for underrated films. This would be on it. It has a good cast, good plot and some clever direction. It's not perfect, and could have done with a little bit extra here and there, but it's certainly worth your time if you're a fan of slow-burning thrillers. Detective John Hobbs (Denzel Washington) has caught a killer. That killer has been sentenced to death. Before dying, the killer warns Hobbs that he'll be watching him. The killer is executed. Hobbs gets on with his life. That is, until another murder is committed - one that is a copycat, one that suggests the original serial killer had an accomplice, or a fan. Hobbs starts to battle the killer, but finds evidence that suggests the killer isn't human, but is a demon that possesses humans and kills to bring about the fall of civilization. Hobbs and the demon begin a game of cat and mouse that leads to Hobbs being suspected of murder himself, and a final, chilling and clever climax.This film is an effective thriller, because it has a good story to begin with. It's not one that's entirely original(demonic possessions have been done before), but Nicholas Kazan's script has enough in it to make it solid and interesting. There is some very credible dialogue, some good plot twists and some good characterization. There is also a solid twist at the end. To build upon the good script, there is also some good acting. Donald Sutherland gives a good, credible performance as the 'couldn't care less' boss who is trying only to cover himself. He in turn is upstaged by John Goodman, who gives a very strong performance as Jonesy, Hobbs' faithful partner. Finally, the direction is strong and sometimes inventive. You get a real feel for the streets of Philadelphia and the countryside around it. More importantly, you get a real feel for the demon because of the good techniques used to portray it. There are some downsides, unfortunately, which do prevent this from being a notch higher. At times, the pace of the film is a little too slow. And because it's just a little too slow, it's easy to lose track of what's happening and why. I feel certainly towards the hour mark, that this needed a little more power and pace behind it. It also could have done with a bit more in terms of the supernatural side - sometimes the demon was underused. I also think that this doesn't represent Denzel Washington at his best. He never seems to really get into this role as much as he could have done. He normally steals a film when he's in it - but this time he's upstaged by Donald Sutherland and John Goodman, who are far more credible in their roles. Finally, the use of the Rolling Stones music detracts from the supernatural element. I am a Stones fan - but their music wasn't right for this movie.

While it's rated R, it's a 'hard R'--and I could almost see it getting an NC-17 if shown today--especially when much more benign films like A Dirty Shame was recently given the NC-17 distinction. In the film, you'll see closeups of a guy peeing, lots of blood, a kid on toilet, lots of teen sex, a very, very explicit rape, and a closeup of a guy getting shot in the eye. This is not necessarily meant as a criticism (after all, this is a gangster film) but you cannot ignore this when you discuss the film.This film is a long and VERY deliberately paced epic film about a small group of men in the Jewish mob. I say deliberately paced, as the famed director, Sergio Leone, took a very, very slow approach to the film. To me, this was a good and bad thing. On one hand, it was beautiful-- the camera-work was great and the look of the film was striking. On the other, the film was nearly four hours long YET most of the characters seemed underdeveloped and vague. In many ways, this makes it reminiscent of Leone's Once Upon a Time in the West--but I think West had a tighter story and more clearly understood characters. The film also was much like this earlier Leone film due to its musical score by Ennio Morricone--though the extensive use of Zamfir's panpipes did set the film apart. For me, I loved and disliked the film at the same time. I sure can respect it--but also was depressed that the film never seemed to completely gel.One aspect of the film I would like to talk about and that is the rape scene. If you see the film, you'll know exactly which scene I am talking about. Part of me liked it because it tended to say that although DiNero's character seemed nice compared to the other thugs, he STILL was a vile thug down deep. And, making the rape so intensely realistic further clarified that this was NOT a sex act or sexy--it was violent and vile. On the other hand, I sure felt uneasy seeing such a super-violent scene begin portrayed THIS vividly--it could easily shake you up or cause strong reactions in rape victims viewing the film.By the way, early in the film, Jennifer Connelly says 'Pesach'. This is the Jewish word for 'Passover'.Also by the way, the makeup was often brilliant. DiNero was aged magnificently by the makeup artists. On the other hand, Elizabeth McGovern's makeup late in the film was pathetic--especially when they slapped on harlequin-like makeup to try to hide the fact that she STILL looked very young. This was sad--especially because in this same scene, DiNero looked 30 years older than her.Overall, I think there's a lot to like and a bit not to like about the film. I think that it is a bit overrated--and reviewers that say it's just as good or better than The Godfather should maybe back off a bit on the hyperbole. It is NOT another Godfather....and the only film that MIGHT get away with that claim is The Godfather II.

","genre":"Crime, Drama"},{"date":"29 August 2011","score":"","review":" Sergio Leone is most definitely the face of the modern western. Leone revolutionized the genre with his raw, brutal, and visceral films that matured and revitalized the spaghetti western and made it into something so much more grand. Once Upon a Time in the West is arguably his most ambitious film, and the biggest production he has ever tackled. It's almost three hours long and boasts an all star cast and very impressive sets. The film is about an assassin working for a massive railroad conglomerate who is out to get a beautiful widow. A mysterious harmonica playing stranger joins forces with a notorious bandit in order to protect this widow and stop this madman. The story is one of epic proportions that spans many large set pieces and an all around epic scale production. But along with all that, it is also one of Leone's most passionate homages to the spaghetti western genre that inspired him to make the classic films he did.Once Upon a Time in the West is slick, cool, stylish, and at times painfully overdrawn. However, it all plays up to the kind of film this is. Sergio Leone is obviously trying to do something so specific with this film and he may have overshot that, but it doesn't detract from the fact that this is such a wicked film. You can easily strip the film down to hard boiled men staring at each other for extended periods of time, but Leone has a way about him to where he can capture those long stares and make them intense, invigorating, and all too captivating. After the first two hours of this you begin to realize how over the top and extraneous these moments are, but a part of you doesn't care because it's the absurdity of these situations that make the film as a whole so much fun.It is in no way a poorly made film, in fact it is quite the opposite. Leone directs with a suave nuance that pulls you into the intensity of the moment and makes you never want to look away. Leone proves his status as one of the greatest directors in history with this epic saga. He couldn't frame his shots any more perfectly. He couldn't capture the heightened emotion and rigorous sincerity any better. He couldn't bring out any more talent in his already incredibly talented lineup of actors even if he tried. There is an elegant purity to the style of this film that is never overbearing to the story, but always remains an incredibly significant element in making this film as epic and as ingenious as possible.I'm not going to say that this is a particularly easy film to sit through. It's not. It is very long and it drags out every scene possible, squeezing every drop of sincerity and intensity out of the story. I would go as far to call it grueling at some points when you just wish the film would move on. But somehow it all pays off in the end and I still managed to love this film. It is what it is, and Leone captured exactly what he wanted with this epic scale production, and I have a lot of respect for that. Under the right circumstances I might sit through this film again, because it is incredibly good despite anything negative I can say about it. But, love it or hate it, there is no denying that Sergio Leone did things for the western genre no other director did during the latter half of the 20th century. And for that, my admiration of Sergio Leone grows exponentially, and it brings me around to having undying respect and love for Once Upon a Time in the West.

However, it is not without it's flaws. It is, at the end of the day, too long. Some scenes are just not necessary (the random 'lady of the woods' scene comes to mind) and I can't see why they weren't cut from the final edit. Other problems include Orlando Bloom, who always looks as if he's about to start laughing throughout the film, and Gimley, who's lines desperately try to inject humour but badly and in all the wrong places. Also I'm struggling to see why Gimley is even there, as he always seems to be more of a hindrance than a help.However, these things do not bring this movie down far enough to be any less than excellent. Sir Ian McKellen is a good Gandalf, wise, knowing and suitably grey. The visual effects are stunning even today, and as I say the hobbits are extremely well done, as how they look so much smaller than everyone else. Sean Bean is brilliant as the good, but weak minded Boromir and does, in my opinion, the best performance in the whole trilogy. But the best thing about this film is the direction. The fight scenes are well orchestrated, with sword shwinging and axe flinging all round, but not in a distasteful way. The landscapes are beautiful, the jaw- dropping shots of characters galloping across huge open planes on horseback are outstanding and the orcs are definitely gruesome enough to deserve more than a PG rating (in my opinion). The scenes with the baddies are dark, the scenes with the goodies are noble, and the overall feel of Middle Earth is achieved well thanks to Peter Jackson's direction and Andrew Lesnie's cinematography.Overall, it is certainly an excellent film, even if it is not perfect, and I hold it as the best LOTR of the trilogy.

Not that Thunderdome is a terrible movie by any means, it's just an average Saturday night popcorn piece that doesn't really push cinema's boundaries like the Director is easily capable off.Once again, we are thrown straight into it from the beginning. Max, now scraggy haired and older is knocked from his camel led cart, by a well filmed ariel assault. His transport and belongings taken to be auctioned at the nearby dwelling of Bartertown. Ran on methane from pig excrement, anything can be bartered here, including 24 hrs of your life, which Max gives to get his camels back. Here we find a few interesting individuals. One being Auntie Eternity, played by Tina Turner. dressed from head to toe in futuristic garb, she looks pure Amazonian. Another being Master-Blaster. A seven foot simpleton with his 3ft Boss played by Angelo Rossito strapped to his enormous shoulders. The Thunderdome, a futurist semi-globe of welded iron where people of Barertown do battle, is only shown for a single fight scene, making the movies title a cool sounding yet redundant choice.The second part of the movie, does get stranger. We are introduced to a tribe of Children, not to far away from those of Lord Of The Flies or The Emerald Forest. The pace then seems to drag and although intriguing, it just doesn't fit with what was an interesting first act. A big problem with Miller's third movie, is that the tone is completely different. Therefore it's more of a standalone piece. Max could have really been portrayed as any drifter passing through an unruly part of the world. We presume Max is still in Australia, yet the accents are largely American, with a few native and even some English. Just where on earth are we? Gone is the apocalyptic high octane horror and action of earlier. Here are vehicles ran on pig crap. The violence is more comical, with lots of slapstick, and you never really feel Max is under threat from the bizzaro bunch of Henchman. More comedy than cannibal culinary. What I would have given to see a Wez-like predator or another Lord Humungus of the wastelands. The picture is peppered with rehashed moments from the others, which does hint that George was sticking with what has worked in the past on an older, more exclusive audience. Repackaged, toned down and offered on a plate as a popcorn flick. Bruce Spence, The Giro Captain from Road Warrior appears to play a similar if not the same character, we are never quite sure. There seems to be a moment of recognition from Max, but not mutually. Credited as Jeradiah this time, but then again he's not flying a Giro-Copter. His son, a chip off the old block sporting a shaggy mop of blonde hair, a similar shade to the target off Giro's affections from the oil compound? -possibly. Another being the Tribe of children, like fifty Emil Mintys, but less Ferrel like. The big one though has to be the ending of Thunderdome, without giving away any spoilers you will have seen a similar chase before, whilst it entertains, it's nowhere near as brutal or as exciting.

A seven foot simpleton with his 3ft Boss played by Angelo Rossito strapped to his enormous shoulders. The Thunderdome, a futurist semi-globe of welded iron where people of Barertown do battle, is only shown for a single fight scene, making the movies title a cool sounding yet redundant choice.The second part of the movie, does get stranger. We are introduced to a tribe of Children, not to far away from those of Lord Of The Flies or The Emerald Forest. The pace then seems to drag and although intriguing, it just doesn't fit with what was an interesting first act. A big problem with Miller's third movie, is that the tone is completely different. Therefore it's more of a standalone piece. Max could have really been portrayed as any drifter passing through an unruly part of the world. We presume Max is still in Australia, yet the accents are largely American, with a few native and even some English. Just where on earth are we? Gone is the apocalyptic high octane horror and action of earlier. Here are vehicles ran on pig crap. The violence is more comical, with lots of slapstick, and you never really feel Max is under threat from the bizzaro bunch of Henchman. More comedy than cannibal culinary. What I would have given to see a Wez-like predator or another Lord Humungus of the wastelands. The picture is peppered with rehashed moments from the others, which does hint that George was sticking with what has worked in the past on an older, more exclusive audience. Repackaged, toned down and offered on a plate as a popcorn flick. Bruce Spence, The Giro Captain from Road Warrior appears to play a similar if not the same character, we are never quite sure. There seems to be a moment of recognition from Max, but not mutually. Credited as Jeradiah this time, but then again he's not flying a Giro-Copter. His son, a chip off the old block sporting a shaggy mop of blonde hair, a similar shade to the target off Giro's affections from the oil compound? -possibly. Another being the Tribe of children, like fifty Emil Mintys, but less Ferrel like.

It, however, was in 1994 that Wes Craven came up with the radical idea of bringing Freddy back for another nightmare a New Nightmare. Gone was funny Freddy and the fresh looking 80\u2032s MTV teenagers and in was a concept so unique and groundbreaking that it just couldn't work? Or could it But..let us start back at the beginning. In 1984, horror director Wes Craven created A Nightmare on Elm Street. It was acclaimed as one of the scariest movies ever made and made unknowns like Robert Englund, Johnny Depp, and Heather Langenkamp huge stars. Ten years later, Heather is living happily with her husband, Chase, and her son, Dylan. But her life has now been turned upside down because she is being stalked by a person who sounds like Nightmare villain Freddy Krueger. Chase has just been killed in a car accident after he accidentally fell asleep behind the wheel. Dylan refuses to sleep any more, and New Line Cinema has just offered her a part in the ultimate Nightmare. But some other strange things have been happening, including earthquakes and Craven being tight-lipped about the script. The ultimate truth is that Freddy Krueger is actually an ancient demon breaking out into our world, but in order to do that, he must go through Heather. And he knows he can get out by harming those near her.Sound convoluted? Pretentious? Overly meta? Shockingly, no. New Nightmare is that rare horror film in which everything works. The performances are pitch perfect, lead by a tour-de-force performance by the amazing Langenkamp. The script is full of twists and turns and the movie is quite possibly the best looking of the entire series. What starts out as a maze of mirrors becomes something much more than your typical nightmare. The film examines the role film plays on those who watch it. Something that Wes Craven's Scream would play out to great effect two years later. I really can't say enough about this film and homages to the original are expertly placed. It is one of my all time favorite horror films and a modern classic.

I have heard many good things about 'The Devil's Backbone' over the years, but this is my first viewing. I must say I'm impressed with what I saw, despite the subtitles; it's quite an engaging tale. I'll tell you more after this brief summary.Set during the Spanish civil war, the story surrounds the goings on at a remote orphanage. Carlos has been left there after his father is killed at the front and, under the care of the people who run the orphanage, principally Dr. Casares and Carmen; he is assigned a bed and introduced to the other boys. Other people at the orphanage include the surly Jacinto, and the young maid, Conchita. One of the boys, Jaime, is slightly bigger than Carlos and, at first bullies him a bit, but they eventually become friends. On his first night, Carlos hears a noise that turns out to the ghost of a boy who was murdered at the orphanage. This boy, Santi, knows a secret, the place where they are hiding some gold. Unfortunately, Jacinto also knows the secret and is already looking for a way to get it. I'll leave it there or the Spoiler Police will be putting me in that water-filled pit in the basement again.This is, again, a beautifully made film, filled with the little nuances I've found del Toro puts in many of his films. It's very much a character-driven piece and they are, for the most part interesting and well rounded. As usual, it's quite hard to judge performances in a foreign language, but I could find no fault with any of them. Marisa Paredes did a great job as Carmen, as did Eduardo Noriega as Jacinto and Federico Luppi, who bears a striking resemblance to Christopher Lee, as Dr. Casares. Fernando Tielve was great as Carlos, as was Íñigo Garcés as Jaime. Finally, I thought Irene Visedo was good as Conchita, although I thought her character was a little under used.As I've already said, this is very much a character-driven piece, where the interrelationships between the various characters are very much to the fore. Some are quite surprising and, at times shocking. Quite a complicated plot, but well worth sticking with as it all ties up in the end quite neatly. It did, unfortunately fall a little flat in the middle, but I feel further viewings will probably iron out any problems I found there.

Brooks (Terms of Endearment, Broadcast News) directed this $50 million-plus romantic comedy, set in Manhattan. Dysfunctional, acid- tongued romance novelist Melvin Udall (Jack Nicholson), who suffers from an obsessive-compulsive disorder, takes pride in his ability to offend. At a nearby cafe, the only waitress willing to stand up to his sarcastic tirades is Carol Connelly (Helen Hunt), a single mother struggling to raise her chronically asthmatic son. In Melvin's West Village apartment building, talented contemporary artist Simon Nye (Greg Kinnear) lives across the hall from Melvin. Simon is the current darling of the New York art world, reason enough to draw Melvin's verbal fire, but Simon's gay lifestyle is further grist for the novelist's malicious mill. These three New Yorkers, none of whom appears to have a chance in hell at finding true happiness, discover their fates intertwined because of the fourth complicated character in the piece, Verdell, a tiny Brussels Griffon dog (played by newcomer Jill, after a 15-week training program). Melvin seems to have no friends or family, and he lives alone, working on his 62nd book. When Simon goes into the hospital after a brutal mugging, Melvin has to take care of Verdell, and the dog actually warms Melvin's cold heart -- to the degree that he sets up unsolicited medical care for Carol's son. Eventually, Melvin is cornered into driving Simon and Carol to Baltimore, and during a hotel stopover, Melvin confesses to Carol, You make me want to be a better man. The trip becomes an odyssey of self-realization for all three.Starring, Jack Nicholson, Helen Hunt, Greg Kinnear, Cuba Gooding Jr., Skeet Ulrich , Shirley Knight , Yeardley Smith , Lupe Ontiveros , Jesse James , Harold Ramis , Jamie Kennedy , Leslie Stefanson , Wood Harris.Directed by the superb director, James L.

With the weapon, the ape kills the leader of the opposing tribe, creating the multiple allusion to the invention as killer the monster in Frankenstein or Hal9000 later in the movie. To rejoice in the kill, he tosses the weapon into the air, and the cut jumps directly into the future the world of 2001 in outer space.Amidst the vastness, we quickly learn the future world. There are harmless creations, like video conferencing, where a man communicates with his family back home. Then we have a computer that talks called Hal9000. Going off the theme of man as creator, we can assume that in the world of 2001 that invention is the future.Mankind as creator makes Hal9000, a super computer with the ability to read lips. To make the invention more personable, we call the supercomputer Hal for short. He even has a personality. He is our friend that we can talk to.I can just imagine the thrill one would get viewing this on its release date in theaters.

It's got everything a good comedy needs, Whoopi Goldberg and nuns. It's incredibly funny, well-acted and also has a fantastic beat. This a film I could watch again and again, I must've seen it about 12 times now and it doesn't get any more boring than the last.Whoopi Goldberg is really fun as Delores Van Cartier who's on the run from her mob boyfriend, and so has hide-out in a convent and so becomes a temporary nun, Sister Mary-Clarence. From here on we're treated to incredibly funny sequences about poor Delores absolutely hating her time as a nun. However she's then asked to teach the nun's choir (who are really awful, in a hilarious way) and gives them a modern-day twist to the disapproval of the stern Mother Superior, played brilliantly by Dame Maggie Smith who seems to have great fun in her role. However, the choir attracts hundreds of locals, making the church a packed-out showroom.Sister Act is one of the funniest films I have ever seen. Whoopi Goldberg is absolutely hilarious like she was in Ghost and it's also brilliantly written with such a sharp and friendly wit that's sure not to offend anyone, which is a rarity in comedies we see nowadays. Also the plump one from Hocus Pocus is on another funny turn as the big friendly nun. She lights up the screen whenever she's on and t's wonderful to see.Never dull, always fun with a toe-tapping beat. My only complaint is that they didn't sing enough songs! They're so much fun and you really get into them. It's also great to see such humorously written characters. Each nun is individually funny which is great to see. If you haven't seen Sister Act yet then you're missing out big time. It's smart, fresh and funny and I can't sing enough praise for this gloriously uplifting film! Best moment When Delores strokes a dog ","genre":null},{"date":"29 August 2011","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Sister Act is a highly underrated film, to me it's a classic and should be more appreciated. It's got everything a good comedy needs, Whoopi Goldberg and nuns. It's incredibly funny, well-acted and also has a fantastic beat. This a film I could watch again and again, I must've seen it about 12 times now and it doesn't get any more boring than the last.Whoopi Goldberg is really fun as Delores Van Cartier who's on the run from her mob boyfriend, and so has hide-out in a convent and so becomes a temporary nun, Sister Mary-Clarence. From here on we're treated to incredibly funny sequences about poor Delores absolutely hating her time as a nun. However she's then asked to teach the nun's choir (who are really awful, in a hilarious way) and gives them a modern-day twist to the disapproval of the stern Mother Superior, played brilliantly by Dame Maggie Smith who seems to have great fun in her role. However, the choir attracts hundreds of locals, making the church a packed-out showroom.Sister Act is one of the funniest films I have ever seen. Whoopi Goldberg is absolutely hilarious like she was in Ghost and it's also brilliantly written with such a sharp and friendly wit that's sure not to offend anyone, which is a rarity in comedies we see nowadays. Also the plump one from Hocus Pocus is on another funny turn as the big friendly nun. She lights up the screen whenever she's on and t's wonderful to see.Never dull, always fun with a toe-tapping beat. My only complaint is that they didn't sing enough songs!

What he did in remaking a 50's science fiction movie into a super horror movie was just genius. The story has these guys (and it is all males, not a female to be seen) at some sort of research facility in Antarctica, I think. They discover something that has been removed from the ice at another facility, having been led there after witnessing a helicopter chasing after a dog with the purpose of killing it. Well they explore the base and take said dog back to their base, which in turn leads to some thing moving about the facility. It seems to infect or take on properties of those it kills, it is kind of hard to say, but when you find it out it goes all out to defend itself making for some of the most gruesome special effects you have ever seen. I love the scene with the shock pads and the head, who can forget the head? The movie also has such tense moments as you do not know who could be the thing and the group of dwindling survivors gets more and more nervous and paranoid as their numbers go down. The monster effects would inspire a lot of horror movies and games, just look at the recent Dead Space video game for things that look like they came straight out of this movie. This movie would also be Carpenter's greatest movie, looking at this one wonder's how he could have made a movie as bad as Ghosts of Mars. This is also one of Kurt Russell's best roles as well, he and Carpenter always make a good team and this movie makes for a good night of fear, suspicion and gore. The thing could be anywhere...or be anyone!

And for 2 hours and 11 minutes it's most certainly not true. 'Northwest' is an essential thriller, and one of Hitchcock's best.Cary Grant stars as a Mad Man (advertising agent) who is mistaken for a spy. Things don't go his way, and he becomes wanted for murder too. He goes on the run to find out what's going on, aided by Eve Kendall. Unlike many other thrillers, even Hitchcock's own quintessential 'Psycho', events are set into motion right away. And then you can't let go. There are many twists, some small, some large, but right until the abrupt end, a viewer cannot call this film boring.It starts with the leading man. Cary Grant looks the part of a New York businessman. His surprised expression isn't the most convincing, but his charm is. His chemistry with Eve Marie Saint chemistry makes the dialogue-laden scenes, namely the remarkable train scene, interesting and charming to watch. They're a great couple.Speaking of scenes, Northwest has several notable and famous ones. The aforementioned train sequence, the art auction, and the lunchroom are cute, funny and shocking, but two steal the show. The very famous plains with the cropduster, and the chase on Mount Rushmore. The duster is just so out there it's fantastic, and the most iconic part of the film, and the chase is grand and nailbiting.Worth noting, the title sequence is really cool, and the musical score is fitting. On another note, two things bugged me *mild spoilers* why Thornhill would pull the knife out and turn to a camera is beyond me and unbelievable- I understand it moved the plot, but Hitchcock's a smart guy, he could've thought of a more reasonable scenario. Also the ending, while involving everything necessary, was very abrupt. We went from danger to 'The End' in less than 10 seconds. But these are acceptable issues in an otherwise outstanding film that as stood the test of time and aged very well. 8.7\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"29 August 2011","score":"","review":" IMDb Top 250 39 They said I lived a dull life. says Roger Thornhill, hero of the Hitchcock classic, 'North by Northwest'.
