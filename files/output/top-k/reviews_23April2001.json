I don't think that's an understatement, and I'm not just saying it cause I'm a Bill Murray fan and he happens to be in it.  Granted, he brings to the movie his usual subtle quirkiness, but that humor isn't out of line with the general mood of the film.  The whole thing is seriously funny and somehow seriously real, but at the same time doesn't always take itself seriously.  Seriously.  The idea of the movie doesn't come off sounding like a very captivating plot high school geek and middle-aged millionaire fall in love with the same first grade teacher.  Not exactly material for a high-grossing box office hit.  But I don't think plot necessarily matters when it comes to making a quality film.  It has a fantastic script, believable character development, and top-notch acting, and that's what counts in making a memorable film.  Why do we love Rushmore? Max and Mr. Blume are the same person, Mr. Blume is just older and wealthier.  They are both creative, romantic characters whose motives are ultimately selfish.  My guess is if you appreciate this film, it's probably because you're the same way.  This movie is about us.  We are the boys who do everything we want to and nothing we're supposed to.  The ones who go to college and get by on as little effort as possible, but somehow still pull through.  At one point or another we all believed we could make our fantasies a reality, and watching this film makes us optimistic about those things again.Also, I don't think a soundtrack makes a film, but it can certainly help set the mood.  Yes, I have to agree with the other commenters for Rushmore great soundtrack.  But you already know that and it's been said a hundred times, so I think I'll just leave it at that and not beat it into the ground any more than it already has.Right.  Good movie, watch it if you haven't yet. ","genre":null},{"date":"23 April 2001","score":"149 out of 201 people found the following review useful","review":"  One of the greatest films ever?

Anthony Hopkins delivers a performance that truly deserved his Oscar nomination. His acting is amazing. There are so many scenes where he is able to connect with the viewer. I only wish I could say the same about the rest of the cast. Here's a movie that has an all star cast; Joan Allen, James Woods, Bob Hoskins, E.G. Marshall, Paul Sorvino, and Ed Harris. And among all of them, not one of them stand out! Was Stone really that unaware of the talent he had in this movie. Lets take Joan Allen for example. Here's a great actress and she was given such an awful, bland role! There were no memorable moments. The same thing is true with James Woods. I would go as far as to say that James Woods is one of the best actor we have alive today. But, what's the good of it?! Everyone in this movie is mildly or barely used. Another bad thing about this movie is it was filmmed so low key. And by that I mean, there are moments were the film carries no energy. It's just so dull! There were many scenes were I sat there bored. The only other good thing I can say about this movie is I like the way the film doesn't take sides. It doesn't try to lean towards the left by saying that Nixon was a bad President. That he didn't end the war soon enough. And, it doesn't try to lean towards the right. By stating that he was a great President who was misunderstood or wasn't giving a chance. Even though the ending does seem a bit sentimental. The movie doesn't try to be preachy. It lets us decide for our own how we want to look at what Nixon did while in office. It merely trys to state the facts. For people who are young and know little about Nixon the movie can be informative. You will learn about the him and what happened durning his Presidency. For those who were around when it actually happened, there's nothing here that's new for you to see. Overall I can't help feel that this movie is way too long. It a little bit over the 3 hour mark. But, it feels so much longer! It's low key, and has no energy. ** out of **** ","genre":null},{"date":"23 April 2001","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  One of the best arguments that can be made to defend this movie is that Oliver Stone and Anthony Hopkins went at this movie with the intention to take on the material with a lot of care.

The story concerns a soulless press-agent who seeks to curry favor with a powerful, corrupt Walter Winchell-like gossip columnist. Every twist and turn of the plot is telegraphed well in advance, and the machinations of the various players are out of a Victorian melodrama. What makes the movie wretched is that it, or rather those responsible for it, are so damned pleased with themselves. The atmosphere is fifties-edgy; everyone seems to be either on speed or caffeine overload. Most of the people speak to each other in little arias, expressing either self-interest, a contempt for others, or both, these always underlined by a sense of moral irony inconsistent with the characters in question. The movie is like a tabloid, always ripping the lid off this or that, telling us either what we already know or don't care to find out about various hot topics of the time. As a character study it doesn't work because the bad guy is so amoral that he is a monster pure and simple. We never get to know him because there's only one thing about him that matters, his willingness to destroy and humiliate those who won't do his bidding. If he has friends or a personal life they are not shown. He does not seem like a human being and Burt Lancaster plays him as not like a human being. Tony Curtis, as the toady of the moment, is more credible, but all we learn about him is how ambitious he is and how much he wants to be like his idol and chief torturer. No one else, not even Lancaster's (much) younger sister, really matters. In comparison one can imagine the Nazi high command as vastly more charming and magnanimous than the characters in this picture. The film barrels along at about 200 mph and is certainly never boring, but it isn't moving, either. New York at night never looked more menacing. Nor is it ever, for an instant, attractive, as it is strangely unseductive, and overall disgusting, like a bad piece of corned beef stuck in the back of the throat. In the end the picture itself seems sleazier than those people whose souls, or lack thereof, it is purporting to expose, and it left a bad taste.

Wee see a beautiful eye, but even though of its beauty, is filled with sorrow, and that's because its dreams just went away and with them, its freedom and happiness. We see the ocean at the back reminding us how dreams come and go like waves, and how they shatter when they hit the shore just like dreams do when they hit reality.This film is like a bucket full of ice and acid thrown at your face while you were sleeping and having the most beautiful dream you've ever had. It's like waking up to the real world after being distracted from it all your life by a silk curtain that suddenly falls and the truth is discovered in the most brutal manner.What are dreams? Can you live your whole life based on dreams and never realize the truth even if it is just in front of you? How hard is to lose those dreams and begin to live life, as it is, brutal, rude and fast? All this questions are answered in this film. A film that stands up from all the films of its kind I've ever seen in my whole life.Notwithstanding of its crudeness, is filled with beauty, color and hope. Hope is the last you lose at times of adversity, and this is proven by the characters of the film, who are incredibly well portrayed by Ellen Byrstein, Jared Leto, Jennifer Connelly, and one of the Wayans Bros.This film is a complete new experience, but not a very pleasant one, is one of those films that you love or hate, but nothing in between. A film that I don't think I would ever see again for what it made me feel, but that I would certainly recommend to anyone.

The story is so simple, but I've never seen or heard of another movie like it -- a document of two people meeting on a train in Europe, deciding to spend the day with each other and falling in love.  There's a line in the movie which goesI believe if there's any kind of God, it wouldn't be in any of us.  Not you, or me... but just this little space in between. If there's any kind of magic in this world, it must be in the attempt of understanding someone, sharing something. I know, its almost impossible to succeed, but... who cares, really? The answer must be in the attempt.The movie is filled with intelligent lines like this between two intelligent, likable, complicated, confused people, just contemplating life and each other, which just hit me with their truth and beauty.  It sounds cornball, I know.  Ultimately, Before Sunrise may be nothing if not a test of how sappily romantic you are.  But I think objectively it succeeds because it walks the line so artfully between realism and romanticism, and I think you have to be a little bit of both to like it  knowing how unlikely it is for a stranger on a train to change your life, but allowing for the possibility, and rooting for people who take it when it comes.There's a voyeuristic element to the film, like My Dinner With Andres, or a documentary, where you're just listening to people talking, and it wouldn't be anything worth mentioning if it weren't so beautifully written, and completely believable.

Turns out I was right in the end. However, be warned that this isn't what all the hype will lead you to expect. Seeing trailers full of men in small slips, and video boxes smeared with award-winning super comedy bla bla bla all over them is rather misleading. It's not the kind of comedy where you spend the entire film in a fit of hysterical giggles. The Full Monty makes you smile rather than laugh out loud (unless you happen to find the idea of men with no clothes on so wildly exotic that it makes you laugh insanely). It's more gentle approach will probably disappoint a few, but there's a lot to like in return.The characters, for instance were surprisingly likeable. The type of a bad boy inept father who does try his best and cares for his offspring underneath is something that's been done to death, but it's rarely worked better than with Gary's character. Dave's insecurity about his weight was also something that made his character very sympathetic. Touches like these made me take to the characters, their weaknesses made them likeable, and their portrayal never seems all too cliché. A very pleasant surprise was how the number 1 cutest blokey and the number 3 cutest blokey fall in love (ranking based on my own personal standards, so it's not too much of a spoiler, I hope ^^).

It's a pirate movie, plain and simple. A pirate movie is supposed to be unrealistic, campy fun. After all, Errol Flynn is classic, and he portrays PIRATES as romantic heroes--so, first off, if you want realism, consider the genre. Okay, now into the film. As a moviegoer, film student and someone with a brain, I can safely say that this is a fine film! To break it down The score is absolutely fantastic, and I know this will sound sacreligious to some, but on par with Star Wars. Lust listen to the CD sometime. The film is beautifully photographed, the costumes are exquisite, the sets marvelous to behold, and believe it or not it's probably the most accurate pirate movie technically speaking (no rapiers here, but brutal, no-skill cutlass brawling, pirate terminology, dress, and even the way they open rum bottles!). But, if it's so good, why did it bomb? Unfortunately, there is one thing wrong with this movie--it's own production values. With the actors surrounded by such lavish sets and special effects, you feel you ARE IN the Caribbean, and so you want to it be realistic, but, as I said, it's a pirate movie, and stays campy. Now, this uneasy feeling you have when watching it gets compounded by the slightest slip-up, and, like any movie, there are many. However, if you can just keep in mind that it's supposed to be fun, free-spirited adventure, you'll have a great time! But I must, in all honesty, point out some really bad parts of the film First, the monkey and the cabin boy are way too Disneyesque, and in fact never contribute to the plot, but rather than try to look cute, and come off as annoying (heck, the monkey in Raiders of the Lost Ark did more than most villains ever do). There are a few no brainers that subtly but powerfully make you want to dislike the movie (like when they leave the cliffs so as not to be seen and thus not let Morgan be found but leave the ropes there anyway, or when they all hide in a bush ten feet away from a guy and aren't seen). But what it all comes down to is that this was still an enjoyable film, and would have done very well if the critics didn't program people into believing it was bad to begin with. This film is proof that critics have finally succeeded in deluding peoples' minds so much that they have no opinion of their own, and simply go with the popular concensus (usually made from heresay more than experience). The pirate genre is relatively new to this generation, so people didn't know what to expect, and so, rather than giving the film a fair shake, the critics assaulted it (I guess they had to meet their quota of negativity and dirt, and Cutthroat was their scapegoat). Well, you know, Disney's Fantsia flopped when it came out to, no studio wanted Forrest Gump, and Star Wars was made almost on an accident, so, who is to say what is quality and what isn't?

Yi Yi is the most beautiful film I have seen. It deals with issues revolving around a typical Chinese family in Taiwan, focusing on the father, his daughter and son. All of this is revolve around a grandmother who is in a coma.The father (NJ) was a family man, who had to deal with pass relationship and his opportunist business partners. He as Ota (his Japanese associate) puts it A good guy. He is also a rather reserve person, holding onto his opinion without making the other person loose face. Finally I felt NJ was loyal both towards his partners and family. To me NJ represented typical Chinese composure and emotion compare to Westerners, such as not hugging his wife when she was distraught or not being blunt with his thoughts.Ting-Ting, the daughter had to deal with relationship and friendship issues, at the same time she seemed to blame herself for her grandmother's condition. I felt Ting-Ting expressed the most emotion in the film due to her role as a teenager growing up.The gem of the film was NJ's 8 year old son. The youngster IMHO sums up what were in other's mind. He was naive, determine, playful and thoughtful and such a natural in front of the camera! His letter towards the grandmother's funeral at the end well, bought tears to my eye. *sniff*I also like the performance by Ota, I love his ways of explaining things. Could this be the Japanese way of doing business? )I love the subtle camera work such as focusing on NJ's wife's confession via the table mirror.

Certainly, there have been those films which I have enjoyed, but so few and far between were they that as a whole, I had little hope of ever finding a REAL film amongst them. then, this came along. A classicly styled fantasy epic, so vividly brought to life that it almost makes you cry at the commitment its creators have demonstrated. And it was animated, which was the perfect choice for this story. The music, sound effects, the direction, which honestly I have never been able to detect in an animated feature before, the story-it all boiled down to one of the greatest viewing pleasures I have ever had.     Now, if there is a complaint to be made, it is that there are sequences which seem a little overdone, or bits of dialogue that somehow seem out of place, or at least badly performed, which is surprising being that the voice casting of the English dub for the film is extraordinary. Aside from that, EVERYTHING else is pitch perfect.     This is a film where you can usually count the digits on a hand, and come up with the right number. Where when the breeze sweeps through a persons hair, not only do you see it, but you can nearly feel it yourself. A film that has the courage to show its audience something profound in a format which, in the United States, is sorely lacking. In this country, the creatures would all be cute, not menacing. Here, even the most docile of creatures has a realistic edge. It would have none of the philosophy this contains, and most heartbreaking of all, it would be overlooked entirely, all for the simple fact that it was animated. This proves the point that animation is an art form. CARTOON does not apply in this case.          The film isn't for children, & I would never recommend this to anyone under 13. Not because of excessive violence, foul language or nudity, but rather because the tone and the complexities of the story will probably not keep the interest of most under the aforementioned age, or even interest them in the first place.     This is a film, which, when compared to live action features such as Excalibur, Gawian and the Green Knight, Dragonslayer, Conan, Beastmaster-it has only one difference the freeing majesty afforded it by virtue of being animated. I mention these films as they are similar in tone and texture to this, yet, somehow, this surpasses them all. Not just the greatest animated film of all time, but perhaps the greatest fantasy film in cinema history.

In fact, most of the changes made to the movie improve on the original, and while original films are almost always more appealing than their descendants, I preferred Tortilla Soup in almost every way (the movie misses the pristine visual composition of the original, but this is a small tradeoff, and more than made up for by the handsome production design).  It's often said that comedy is much more difficult to translate than drama, but a movie as enjoyable as Tortilla Soup doesn't need to justify it's existence as a remake.  The cast is filled with actors that have proven their capability time and time again, and they interact here with a low-key assurance that radiates throughout the production and fills the screen with warmth and festive good spirit.Standing out from the rest of the excellent cast is Hector Elizondo, whose portrayal of a man whose life consists, in about equal measures, of running the kitchen of a highly successful restaurant and the lives of his three daughters.  Mr. Elizondo projects calm, complete authority in every scene he is in; even in the cooking scenes, he moves through the kitchen, handles the food, checks the army of bubbling pots with the assurance of the master chef.  Throughout his career, Mr. Elizondo has combined his dignified appearance with a precise comic timing that has led to many scene-stealing supporting roles as a slow-burning straight man.  Between his perfectly manicured goatee and his gleaming bald head, he has given his characters a look that simultaneously penetrates his co-actors and twinkles just enough to let the audiences members know that he is not just in on the joke, but knows it better than the stars themselves.  In this movie, he is the star, and it is wonderful to see him use that cultivated persona in new and enriching ways.  He finds perfect credibility as a man who uses the strength of his will to make food transform itself according to his wishes, and yet finds himself baffled when the same approach fails with his daughters.The movie itself finds comic moments throughout based on the confusion generated when men and women try to interact with each other and the inability of one side to understand how the other works.  Fortunately, though, they do (work, that is), and it's a relief to see a comedy that's equally as perceptive of both men and women, and while the plot of the film hinges on the clashes between the members of the family, the characters themselves remain wholly, delightfully functional.
