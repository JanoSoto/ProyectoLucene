The Matrix is one of those complex and sometimes uncomprehending to some sci-fi thrillers that is so visually entertaining that you might get lost from it's original story. Pay attention to this! Thomas A. Anderson (Keanu Reeves) is a computer programmer and hacker known as Neo. Neo has always questioned his reality, but the truth is far beyond his imagination. Neo finds himself targeted by the police when he is contacted by Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne), a legendary computer hacker outlawed by the government. Morpheus awakens Neo to the real world, a devastating world where humanity has been controlled by a race of machines that live off of the humans' body heat and energy and manipulate their minds within an artificial reality known as the Matrix. As a rebel against the machines, Neo must return to the Matrix and confront the agents. The plot is very science related but is a little confusing. That doesn't prevent pure cinematic entertainment from being replaced. The visual content The Matrix' contains is historical. Intense shootouts and bizarre production designs make this not only fun to watch, but more and more intriguing and interesting as the film carries on. This film is a Wachowski brothers film, as they wrote and directed it. The ideas they capture are very nerdy but none the less awesome. They allow an incredibly complex science film relate to some of the coolest action films that take place in normal time period by adding elements like shootouts and cheesy dialogue to make it popcorny and not all complex. The legendary costumes with the suits, classes and capes all make the film's setting unique and fun. The film can also bring up interesting ideas about protecting humanity. rising up against corruption and enjoying simple life-styles. The differences are very different in the Matrix world than in the real world, but we find many interesting similarities to our world that this electric and kinetic world has to offer. Visual films that make you think a little are the perfect combination of fun and intelligence. Adding them up is a tough process, so we'll see which side you end up on Thinking, enjoying the action, or both?

Forrest Gump is a unique type of film that is a narrative\/flashback\/current time style film about one man named Forrest Gump, one of the biggest cinematic character icons of all time from legendary actor Tom Hanks. Forrest is mentally challenged. He doesn't suffer from mental retardation, but it can be implied he is slightly autistic. Forrest Gump has had an incredible life. After being bullied as a child for having braces on his legs and being autistic in Georgia, he went on to be an all American football player due to his tremendous speed and ended up meeting JFK. He was a war hero in Vietnam where he lost his friend Bubba but later took care of his family financially due to becoming very successful in Bubba's shrimp business. To add on to Forrest's talent, he became an international ping pong player after becoming skilled in the war hospital and makes a national news landmark by leading many others to go for a run around the country. But the events that shape Forrest's life are not by his achievements but from his relationships. His childhood lover Jenny (Robin Wright) has always been Forrest's main motivation. After a fun childhood and having an abusive father, jenny ends up making mistakes. She became a model for an inappropriate magazine, became a singer at a sex club, joined the hippie movement while Forrest was ironically fighting the war where she became a drug addict, and became highly depressed. Forrest also met his friend Lieutenant Dan, his war leader who lost his legs in Vietnam before Forest saved his life. The two have a fascinating relationship. Forrest and his mother are also very close and encourages Forrest commonly. Forrest Gump tells his story to various people on a bench while sitting on the bus station. What writer Eric Roth does to this adapted story is show us how the simplest people can be inspirations and even heroes. I bet 10\/10 people 9\/10 times would ignore whoever is next to them and find no interest what so ever. Forrest Gump is a man of amazement and can teach us that no matter one's disability mentally or physically, they can be important people. Director Robert Zemmeckis takes us throughout American History and shows how one man's life related to some of the most crucial times our country faced. He uses great time change and uses the shift between flashbacks, narration, and modern time beautifully. We get great film aspects to show this inspiration come to life. The different types of locations are designed beautifully, from Vietnam to the white house, we see amazing settings to portray the life around one simple man. The beautiful character development and classic text allow us to be wrapped around in pure movie magic and experience world class cinema from a talented team. Tom Hanks as Forrest Gump is genius and fun to watch as we see this man be brought to life by one of the greatest actors we will ever see. The supporting cast is terrific and everyone in this picture gives tremendous effort to give us a classic film. It isn't recognized this widely for no reason. The most famous quote from this film is Life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what your going to get. Well, with Forrest Gump you definitely know what your gonna get... an amazing film that is inspiring and reflecting on how each person is beautiful.

Unless you are some sort of a weirdo cinema fan who spends all his time watching every single movie under the sun, the chances are you have never heard of any of those movies. If you do know about any of them, I tip my imaginary hat to your awesomeness.All of the above movies have two things in common. They are terrible. So terrible that every year hipsters around the world gather to watch and pay tribute to them. And they were made by a guy named Ed Wood. You have never heard of him either. Ed Wood has the dishonor of being considered the worst director of all time. Why would anyone make a movie about him? I asked myself the same question until I watched Ed Wood. Johnny Depp gives a heartfelt and hilarious performance as wide eyed talent-less but passionate and endlessly optimistic young man who believes in himself and harbors great hopes of one day making it as big as his idol Orson Wells. Sarah Jessica Parker plays Dolores Fuller his long suffering girlfriend and star of most of his movies and Martin landau as the washed up drug addict real life actor Bella Lugosi, a roll which deservedly won him a best supporting actor Oscar.Other supporting cast includes the always wonderful Bill Murray, Patricia Arquette and Jeffery jones as his band of misfit cast and crew. The film follows the adventures of the titular character and his weird set of friends as the stumbles across Hollywood struggling to make some of his most famous movies. Tim Burton is the perfect choice of director for this movie. His own fascination with freaks and outsiders works wonderfully well here. Shot in black and white, the set designs are perfect.

When Harry Saltzman and Cubby Broccoli produced their series of James Bond films, they made the Bond character into someone more suave and charming. But in the late 1980's, the producers decided to go back to the dark grittiness of the original novels in their films, resulting in possibly the most polarizing and underrated (in my view) film in the entire James Bond canon, Licence to Kill. I understand why a lot of people don't like the film. Many don't like darkness in their Bond films, and they don't like seeing Bond as a brutal killer. When it comes to the Bond films, I myself love the Bond campfest outings (Goldfinger being my favorite action film of all time), but I also love the darkness of some of the later series entries. Licence to Kill is sleek, cold, violent, brutal, and real. Sometimes it's a bit too much of these things to the point where the film is sort of alienating, but I still see it as a wonderful piece of cinema. While the earlier James Bond films were the pique of escapist action cinema, Licence to Kill is a realistic brutal crime thriller. It showcases Bond as a brutal cold agent, more gory violence, a slower pace, and a more realistic and frightening villain than showcased in earlier films. Bond (played powerfully by Timothy Dalton) goes on a vengeful private vendetta against drug lord Sanchez (played by Robert Davi) after his best friend American agent Felix Leiter is left close to death on his wedding day, and after Leiter's bride is killed. Bond is instructed by Bond to abandon his vendetta as it could badly effect the British government. But Bond refuses, resigns, renounces his license to kill, and goes on the run after Sanchez anyway. In this film, Bond is more human as he has ever been up to this point. He's passionate, cold, angry, reckless, and bitter. He is obsessed with avenging Leiter and his wife on Sanchez, and because of this obsession and anger makes terrible decisions. His choices ultimately endanger himself, his career, people around him, and even gets some people killed. His passion, which we can all relate to is taken too far and placed on the wrong things, which we can all relate to. For once, James Bond takes down his enemy by penetrating his organization, much like a real spy. Rather than outright attacking the villain, Bond slowly sews the seeds of doubt in Sanchez's organization and takes him down from the inside. Licence to Kill is obviously not for everyone. It's darker and more violent than earlier Bond films, much to the disdain of some people (understandably). Sometimes the darkness and violence become alienating, and the film could have used some more fire and passion, but I still see Licence to Kill as a marvelous film and even one of the best films in the James Bond canon.

With his performance(s), he creates two very different characters, making it easy to understand why people could actually believe that they were different people.

If lesser actors had been cast in these roles, the film would still have been brilliant in terms of special effects, writing, etc. but its emotional core would have been lost. I have nothing but praise for the rest of the cast as well. The effects were remarkable and groundbreaking for their time and still look great 36 years later in spite of all the advances in that time. The design of the sets was beautiful, particularly during the early sequences on Krypton. At 145 minutes, this is the longest film that I have watched all year but it's also one of the best paced. It never drags, in part due to its epic scale and unusual structure the Krypton scenes are made in the style of a Shakespearean play or Biblical epic, the Smallville scenes present us with a very cosy, Rockwellian slice of Americana and the Metropolis scenes (which form the bulk of the film, obviously!) are essentially a comedy drama. I would say that the Smallville scenes are the weakest but in the sense of being the least good as opposed to awful. In spite of that and one or two other very minor issues such as the film's occasionally contradictory timeline, I'm giving this a perfect score.This is the best depiction of Superman that I've seen in any medium outside of the very best comics as well as the best superhero film that I've seen.

When the victims step into the compound of the wax figures, they get transported into the time of the wax figures and have to play out the scene, but generally that ends in their deaths and they end up as wax figures in the display.

Chaplin directed and starred in this film about his famous tramp character taking care of a young child abandoned by his mother. And thus Chaplin's typical slapstick humor ensues. I know some people could argue that this film isn't edgy enough because it's just Chaplin running around being Charlie Chaplin. And although that's true I do sense a lot more heart in this film, especially during the opening scene, where I legitimately felt bad for the mother getting rid of her child. Life can be cruel sometimes. That being said because this is a Charlie Chaplin film, and to me the comedy and drama didn't blend that well. And keep in mind this is the only problem I have with the film. Because it's a Chaplin film and because it's about his tramp character, you sometimes can't tell the difference between comedy and drama. Like seriously your son being taken away now is not the time for comedy! Other than that I absolutely adored this film. And it looks like audience members did to.
