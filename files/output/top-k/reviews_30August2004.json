Sometimes the twist is unexpected because it is so completely idiotic, that it has no right to be expected at all... like in, well, Frailty.This story about a deranged man who claims to be commanded by God to kill certain people on the basis that they are 'demons' could have had any possible ending, but no, no, no, that the deranged guy is right and that God is actually behind the crimes. Only a complete bigot can reach this repellent conclusion or approve of it. Unfortunately, the movie conclusion is quite literally what it seems to be. You can suppose that the whole thing may be attributed to the unbalanced imagination of the self-appointed Angel of Death, but there is the thing about the video that denies this theory. However, if they insist on the supernatural there is an alternative hypothesis that the makers of this movie do not seem to take into account. Mind you, I don't believe this any more than I believe that God made them do it, but, if someone ordered the crimes, how do they know that the crimes were actually ordered by God and not by the Other Guy? Wouldn't it be very much like he who is, after all, the Father of Lies, to appear before his dupes under the disguise of God, in order to make them commit acts which are, after all, evil and foul? Oh-ho.It is a pity that the ending ruins it, because Frailty is, all in all, very competently done. It keeps the suspense and manages to be quite gruesome and horrifying without any display of gore.

It takes a patient and focused Director to recognize what that kind of actor can do in the right setting.  Most Directors seem to steam roller through their vision of the script and force actors to conform to an abstract idea (they make the poor sprinter sprint anyway instead of giving them a long quiet run to excel at).  High Art isn't about Ally Sheedy showing she's an unappreciated powerhouse, it's about Director Lisa Cholodenko giving Ally the room and role to do the kind of acting she's never been allowed to do.  Fellow distance runner\/lousy sprinter Radha Mitchell is also perfectly placed in every scene.  These two are the narrower players, they're like bold colors you can't use to excess and can't water down without ruining the whole painting.  Then like a good painter Cholodenko does bring in a powerhouse in someone like Patricia Clarkson.  Unlike Sheedy and Mitchell, Clarkson is spread thin and applied liberally.  And I don't mean screen time.  Clarkson's pull on the plot between Sheedy and Mitchell makes their specialized boldness stand out.  It gives them weight and dissolves into itself.  The painting analogies are cheesy, but that's what the grace of this film is to me.  Clarkson is definitely a deeper actor than Sheedy or Mitchell, but instead of upstaging them her role in this film elevates them.  If you were to paint two small but boldly colored flowers on a canvas you would need a more universal, softer backdrop to make the two flowers take form (in a realistic painting at least).  This movie is not about a plotline, not really.  Like a painting it suggests something with a seemingly straight ahead depiction of, well drugs and sexual awakenings, career ambition, disillusionment that follows great success.

These two have proved this fact time and time again and there is no disputing it. In this film, the latter directs the former who plays mercenary book dealer; Dean Corso. Corso is hired by a mysterious book collector to find the last two copies of 'The Nine Gates of the Kingdom of Shadows', a book reportedly co-written by the devil. What follows is a film-noir style mystery, fleshed out by a generous helping of Polanksi's trademark offbeat characters and general weirdness.The euro-Gothic style of the movie, which is reminiscent of such horror classics as Suspiria and Inferno, lends this movie a great style and one that you don't see too often in the more recent horror movies. Roman Polanski is well known for creating the more off-the-cuff type of movie, and this one firmly fits into that mould. Polanski gets to show his wicked sense of humour a few times in this movie too, which is always good to see. The more obvious humour is shown when the truck driver gives Depp a hand signal, but the more absurd humour is at it's best with the fire and wheelchair sequence, which is absolutely delicious and maybe even the best scene in the movie. As mentioned, the movie plays out much like a film-noir mystery. Like other films of this ilk, such as Angel Heart, The Ninth Gate draws you into it's mystery, and is a mystery film first and a horror movie second. This is definitely true of this film, as despite a few scenes of horror; such as the scenes with dead bodies, the film stays in mystery mode for a lot of it's duration and rarely goes over the top, which is much to it's credit.Johnny Depp takes the lead role in this movie. I am a big fan of Johnny Depp; he's a great actor, and he has more than enough about him to totally carry a movie on his own. This is without a doubt Depp's movie, but he is lent support courtesy of a great support cast which includes Emmanuelle Seigner (Polanski's wife and the actress that starred in Frantic and Bitter Moon, two other Polanski films), Frank Langella; who is delightfully creepy, although a little camp in his role as the mysterious collector that hires Depp and Lena Olin, a fine actress that starred alongside Depp in Chocolat.The characters in The Ninth Gate don't undergo that much of a change. This is true for all except Johnny Depp's character. Like any good film-noir, the focus is firmly on the lead and the film is mostly about him being lead deeper and deeper into the film's dark underbelly. The fact that the other characters don't develop much, hardly matters; the story and central character are more than interesting enough to keep the audience interested. The supporting characters that don't develop are already given a defined character anyway, and therefore don't need to develop in order to develop the story. The story is most definitely the most important aspect of this film; it meanders and is as unpredictable as you would expect a Polanski story to be. For the most part, the film stays much within the realms of reality, and it only really ventures out of the realm of logical possibility towards the end.The ending of the movie features a sex scene that doesn't quite fit in with the rest of the movie, and it is never really explained exactly why it's there. By then, however, you will have already spent two hours enjoying your ride through Polanski's twisted mind, and this won't be enough to spoil it, but I do feel that this scene should have been cut from the film as it is unneeded. However, towards the end, the film does feature a deliciously over the top ceremony. Although this also goes against the flow of the movie, it does do it justice as it shows us, basically, what we have wanted to see all along. It is a shame about the very end, as it is rather anti-climatic; but when I think about it, it's the only way that the film could have ended without becoming really silly.

Although this also goes against the flow of the movie, it does do it justice as it shows us, basically, what we have wanted to see all along. It is a shame about the very end, as it is rather anti-climatic; but when I think about it, it's the only way that the film could have ended without becoming really silly.

Watch it with minimal expectations, watch it without the Friday the 13th title and you could enjoy an entertaining horror movie. If you have seen other Jason movies and didn't like them, trust me, JASON LIVES could be the exception as it's not the typical slasher flick. There's black humor, violence, a good score, high quality direction, and a story (something that most slasher flicks lack of).***SPOILERS*** (PLOT, HIGHLIGHTS)**PLOT** Jason Voorhees returns to Camp Crystal Lake (now called Camp Forrest Green) after he is resurrected by accident by Tommy Jarvis, the boy that killed him years before. Jason's resurrection is spectacular, arguably, the best opening sequence in the series. Tommy Jarvis sticks a pole in Jason's corpse when suddenly a thunder strikes it, giving life to Jason by lightning. After raising from his grave, he takes and puts his hockey mask on, and heads his way to Camp Crystal Lake (now officially named Camp Forrest Green to ignore the events of Camp Blood). Tommy after watching Jason's resurrection goes to Sheriff Garrett's office looking for help but the Sheriff withdraws his version and recognizes him as the boy traumatized by Jason and resident of the mental institution.Tommy insists on his story but only ends incarcerated in the sheriff's office. Sheriff Garrett's daughter shows interest on Tommy and later helps him escape and get things in order to face Jason. Meanwhile Jason starts his killing spree and this time his victims are child counselors, plush a gravedigger, a horny couple, and a group of ultra geek explorers. After a series of events including the Sheriff and his officers' deaths and a massacre at Camp Forrest Green, Tommy with the aid of a book of the occult (where he learns that Jason has to be killed in the place where he originally died), chains, gasoline, and a boat; faces Jason in the middle of Crystal Lake. Finally Tommy manages to tie a huge rock with a chain to Jason's neck making him drown (once again)in the bottom of Crystal Lake. Jason chokes Tommy and believes he killed him, while he gets used to his underwater grave, tied to a rock.**HIGHLIGHTS** The opening scene is unique, it has great f\/x, a creepy atmosphere, a scary environment, and black humor surrounding it. The James Bond spoof is excellent! it's stuff for legend. That's a touch of genius with a lot of black humor.The deaths are a bit of disappointing. Many fans of the series think about Jason Lives as the PG-13 Friday the 13th movie. There are still the well known Friday the 13th elements such as gore, sex, violence, sex related jokes, etc. but in a low tone. There are good death scenes like Elizabeth (stabbed in the face), Hawes (has his heart ripped!), Sheriff Garrett (gets his back broken), and Cort (stabbed in the temple) among others. Jason's death in this movie is very well done. The whole scene with the lake in flames, the scared children watching, Megan watching how she could help, Tommy fighting Jason in the middle of the lake; is one of the best elaborated scenes in the whole series. Jason's death should please fans of the series, as Jason is defeated not that easily as in part 2, 3, The Final Chapter, Thew New Blood, and Jason Takes Manhattan.What I love about JASON LIVES is the clever black humor that surrounds it. There's spoof of other movies where everything surrounds the main character (Frankenstein, 007, Evil Dead), it also spoofs horror clichés in a delightful way. JASON LIVES stands alone in the Friday the 13th series because it has elements that are nowhere to be found in the other movies. For example this is the only movie where there's black humor, not explicit death scenes, scary moments, the tense music often used in the series, and an interesting and well crafted story that supports the events. The acting is great for a slasher movie. Thom Mathews (from Return Of The Living Dead fame) delivers an insane and mature performance as the haunted and obsessed with Jason Tommy Jarvis. His performance is believable. What can I say about Megan? (Jennifer Cooke) I think she's the best lead female in the series. She's super hot, sexy, tender, and also brave. She's not the typical Friday the 13th lead female. She even knocks off Jason in the final scene. Great actress, I wonder why she didn't continue in the genre.The other cast members are very good; you can't get much better acting in other slasher movies. The score is great! totally new stuff in the series. You still got the trademark ki ki ki ma ma ma plush a very 80's metal soundtrack, and a great score specially made for the movie. A score that good that was used by The New Blood and House II.Director Tom McLoughin did a great job by giving this touch of quality to the Friday the 13th series. He did a quality horror movie that stands alone from HUNDREDS of 80's cheesiness in horror.JASON LIVES is not a simple slasher movie, it's a horror movie with a story to support it. In other words it's a good horror movie. Probably the best in the series and one of the best horror movies with black comedy. Believe it or not, even with the Friday the 13th part VI title it's a good horror movie that totally deserves a watch by any horror fan.10\/10 in the Friday the 13th scale.

Jason chokes Tommy and believes he killed him, while he gets used to his underwater grave, tied to a rock.**HIGHLIGHTS** The opening scene is unique, it has great f\/x, a creepy atmosphere, a scary environment, and black humor surrounding it. The James Bond spoof is excellent! it's stuff for legend. That's a touch of genius with a lot of black humor.The deaths are a bit of disappointing. Many fans of the series think about Jason Lives as the PG-13 Friday the 13th movie. There are still the well known Friday the 13th elements such as gore, sex, violence, sex related jokes, etc. but in a low tone. There are good death scenes like Elizabeth (stabbed in the face), Hawes (has his heart ripped!), Sheriff Garrett (gets his back broken), and Cort (stabbed in the temple) among others. Jason's death in this movie is very well done. The whole scene with the lake in flames, the scared children watching, Megan watching how she could help, Tommy fighting Jason in the middle of the lake; is one of the best elaborated scenes in the whole series. Jason's death should please fans of the series, as Jason is defeated not that easily as in part 2, 3, The Final Chapter, Thew New Blood, and Jason Takes Manhattan.What I love about JASON LIVES is the clever black humor that surrounds it. There's spoof of other movies where everything surrounds the main character (Frankenstein, 007, Evil Dead), it also spoofs horror clichés in a delightful way. JASON LIVES stands alone in the Friday the 13th series because it has elements that are nowhere to be found in the other movies. For example this is the only movie where there's black humor, not explicit death scenes, scary moments, the tense music often used in the series, and an interesting and well crafted story that supports the events. The acting is great for a slasher movie. Thom Mathews (from Return Of The Living Dead fame) delivers an insane and mature performance as the haunted and obsessed with Jason Tommy Jarvis. His performance is believable. What can I say about Megan? (Jennifer Cooke) I think she's the best lead female in the series. She's super hot, sexy, tender, and also brave. She's not the typical Friday the 13th lead female. She even knocks off Jason in the final scene. Great actress, I wonder why she didn't continue in the genre.The other cast members are very good; you can't get much better acting in other slasher movies. The score is great! totally new stuff in the series. You still got the trademark ki ki ki ma ma ma plush a very 80's metal soundtrack, and a great score specially made for the movie. A score that good that was used by The New Blood and House II.Director Tom McLoughin did a great job by giving this touch of quality to the Friday the 13th series. He did a quality horror movie that stands alone from HUNDREDS of 80's cheesiness in horror.JASON LIVES is not a simple slasher movie, it's a horror movie with a story to support it. In other words it's a good horror movie. Probably the best in the series and one of the best horror movies with black comedy. Believe it or not, even with the Friday the 13th part VI title it's a good horror movie that totally deserves a watch by any horror fan.10\/10 in the Friday the 13th scale.

Can a sequel of the infamous Friday the 13th movies be that good that it should be considered a decent horror movie? The answer is a surprising yes. Watch it with minimal expectations, watch it without the Friday the 13th title and you could enjoy an entertaining horror movie. If you have seen other Jason movies and didn't like them, trust me, JASON LIVES could be the exception as it's not the typical slasher flick. There's black humor, violence, a good score, high quality direction, and a story (something that most slasher flicks lack of).***SPOILERS*** (PLOT, HIGHLIGHTS)**PLOT** Jason Voorhees returns to Camp Crystal Lake (now called Camp Forrest Green) after he is resurrected by accident by Tommy Jarvis, the boy that killed him years before. Jason's resurrection is spectacular, arguably, the best opening sequence in the series. Tommy Jarvis sticks a pole in Jason's corpse when suddenly a thunder strikes it, giving life to Jason by lightning. After raising from his grave, he takes and puts his hockey mask on, and heads his way to Camp Crystal Lake (now officially named Camp Forrest Green to ignore the events of Camp Blood). Tommy after watching Jason's resurrection goes to Sheriff Garrett's office looking for help but the Sheriff withdraws his version and recognizes him as the boy traumatized by Jason and resident of the mental institution.Tommy insists on his story but only ends incarcerated in the sheriff's office. Sheriff Garrett's daughter shows interest on Tommy and later helps him escape and get things in order to face Jason. Meanwhile Jason starts his killing spree and this time his victims are child counselors, plush a gravedigger, a horny couple, and a group of ultra geek explorers. After a series of events including the Sheriff and his officers' deaths and a massacre at Camp Forrest Green, Tommy with the aid of a book of the occult (where he learns that Jason has to be killed in the place where he originally died), chains, gasoline, and a boat; faces Jason in the middle of Crystal Lake.

This movie is also interesting because while Klaatu and his robot come to preserve the peace, they invoke more violence. Also rather than Klaatu and his robot killing just the people who are in charge and are creating this problem they threaten to kill everyone and everything on earth. Later, Klaatu says that the matters on our planet are ours to deal with, but if we continue to show aggression and threaten the other planets that they would destroy us. This doesn't make much sense because while we might be capable of making nuclear bombs, we still didn't have the power to send a nuke into space or anything else of that matter. Klaatu and his robot were truly violating our rights. We had no intentions of going to another planet to start an intergalactic war or such, Klaatu and his robot were really just making attempts to control Earth.

On the other hand we have Klaatu and his robot that are abusing their knowledge of space to control other races that might not agree with their way of living. This film has only aged in the form of movie making and the way the information would have gotten out to people.

This is Edward Norton's finest performance along with Primal Fear and probably American History X.  This is also one of Brad Pitt's best moments, he played the alter ego perfectly.  David Fincher has a knack for the disjointed, dark feel, and he uses it to perfection here.Fight Club is a much deeper film than one would think, seeing how it was marketed and advertised.

Three kings isn't a war movie, at least not in the typical sense. It's more of an action movie charged with intelligent satire. It doesn't pull any punches when it comes to portraying the U.S. government's attitude in the first Iraq war, or even when it shows the half-stupid, half-innocent ignorance of the average U.S. soldier. It manages to make you feel sorry and sympathies for both the American heroes and the Iraqi characters. Which is exactly what war's all about - everybody that's fighting it is a victim of something.This movie is not about acting, not about lengthy dialogues. It's about the story, shot in a frenetic pace, in wonderful, sometimes colourful, sometimes greyish tones, full of great action sequences. But these sequences never are there just for being there, they're truly a part of the story.The acting is competent and the actors were really well picked. The dialogues are sharp, funny, and to the point. Thanks to them, and to the story, with its political content that rings very true today, and has some haunting premonitions ( What do you want us to do? Invade Iraq and have another Vietnam? ), this is not just a guy's movie. It's a movie for anyone who enjoys having a blast at the movies and at the same time leaving them with some food for thought.The only flaw is the ending, which is too quick, and doesn't really leave you feeling like there was a strong climax.

It's yet another in the long line of failed Joseph Conrad adaptations, and quite possibly the very worst. This German-British co-production was an infamously troubled picture that spent a long time on the shelf before being barely released, and it's easy to speculate that much of that time was spent in re-editing. If that was the case, it certainly didn't improve the end product.Conrad is an incredibly cinematic writer at times, but for some reason the film adaptations have all too often been staid, lifeless and overly verbose, and this is certainly a classic example. Where Ridley Scott gave a visual feast to represent the failure of the Napoleonic dream in The Duellists and Richard Brooks managed an intimate epic with Lord Jim, Hampton merely manages a way below average Masterpiece Theater TV adaptation that is short on real cinematic flourish, opening and closing shots aside. The script never comes to grips with the web of daily betrayals on the domestic front that are mirrored by political and official ones, nor does it ever reflect the self-loathing with which Conrad filled the novel (the Verloc family is a grotesque parody of his own). In fact, all it does is hit story points while leaving character and subtext barely touched.Hampton's direction is even worse. Despite paring down the narrative and losing whole characters, he never builds up a sense of momentum. Shots seem awkwardly timed - not disastrously so, but just never quite right - and his handling of what should have been an impressive cast (bar the typically disastrous Patricia Arquette) extremely poor. The three performances are particularly anodyne. Hoskins is invisible in ball the wrong ways as Verloc in an utterly inconsequential performance, Christian Bale never once convinces as the retarded Stevie and the bafflingly prolific Arquette once again proves that while she may have worked with some of the top directors in the business, she's managed to learn absolutely nothing from the experience. To be fair, the performance is not her usually utterly inept zombie impersonation she has actually risen to the level of merely being very bad, her passable cockney accent almost giving the vague illusion that there might be vague signs of life somewhere under her clumsy line readings. But as a tragic heroine, she is indeed, as Cliveowensucks puts it in his review, pitiful in all the wrong ways.Robin Williams is almost successful in his dialogue scenes as the Professor, the one part of the film where Conrad's nihilistic vision of the impossibility of combating political violence remains. His scenes in the restaurant with a gaunt Gerard Depardieu (a long way from his best here) have real power, but this is dissipated by those scenes that require more that stillness. When he moves through the streets of Soho with his hand on a bomb trigger, his stern demeanor frankly looks comical. Nor is he helped by his alleyway encounter with Inspector Heat, played all too broadly by Jim Broadbent in full 'allo, 'allo, 'allo, and what do we 'ave 'ere? mode. Comparisons with his corrupt copper Slater in the Britcom Only Fools and Horses are sadly unavoidable. Nor does Hampton's obsession for casting comedians end there, with Eddie Izzard's naturally hesitant demeanor making him an awkward presence as the ambassador who triggers the plot (Germanic in the novel, Russian here). He almost manages, but menacing bureaucracy is beyond him.Making matters worse is a typical Phillip Glass score. On its own musical terms, it is fine, but allied to the images it does the picture no end of damage. It smothers the performances, draws constant attention to itself and doesn't fit the milieu at all. Only in the impressive opening and closing themes does it add anything elsewhere it just adds the final nail to the coffin.A complete misfire on every level.

Shots seem awkwardly timed - not disastrously so, but just never quite right - and his handling of what should have been an impressive cast (bar the typically disastrous Patricia Arquette) extremely poor. The three performances are particularly anodyne. Hoskins is invisible in ball the wrong ways as Verloc in an utterly inconsequential performance, Christian Bale never once convinces as the retarded Stevie and the bafflingly prolific Arquette once again proves that while she may have worked with some of the top directors in the business, she's managed to learn absolutely nothing from the experience. To be fair, the performance is not her usually utterly inept zombie impersonation she has actually risen to the level of merely being very bad, her passable cockney accent almost giving the vague illusion that there might be vague signs of life somewhere under her clumsy line readings. But as a tragic heroine, she is indeed, as Cliveowensucks puts it in his review, pitiful in all the wrong ways.Robin Williams is almost successful in his dialogue scenes as the Professor, the one part of the film where Conrad's nihilistic vision of the impossibility of combating political violence remains. His scenes in the restaurant with a gaunt Gerard Depardieu (a long way from his best here) have real power, but this is dissipated by those scenes that require more that stillness. When he moves through the streets of Soho with his hand on a bomb trigger, his stern demeanor frankly looks comical. Nor is he helped by his alleyway encounter with Inspector Heat, played all too broadly by Jim Broadbent in full 'allo, 'allo, 'allo, and what do we 'ave 'ere? mode. Comparisons with his corrupt copper Slater in the Britcom Only Fools and Horses are sadly unavoidable. Nor does Hampton's obsession for casting comedians end there, with Eddie Izzard's naturally hesitant demeanor making him an awkward presence as the ambassador who triggers the plot (Germanic in the novel, Russian here). He almost manages, but menacing bureaucracy is beyond him.Making matters worse is a typical Phillip Glass score. On its own musical terms, it is fine, but allied to the images it does the picture no end of damage. It smothers the performances, draws constant attention to itself and doesn't fit the milieu at all. Only in the impressive opening and closing themes does it add anything elsewhere it just adds the final nail to the coffin.A complete misfire on every level. ","genre":"Drama, Thriller"},{"date":"30 August 2004","score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":"  `Halloween II' is a more than adequate sequel to one of the greatest horror films of all time.**SPOILERS**After Laurie (Jamie Lee Curtis) has been removed from the Myer's house and hauled away to a hospital, Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasance) and Sheriff Brackett (Charles Cyphers) scour the neighborhood for Michael after he disappeared. Michael recovers, finds a new knife and discovers where Laurie is staying. He storms off after her as Loomis finds a young teen that resembles Michael and accidentally allows his death. At the hospital, the staff is anxiously awaiting Laurie's arrival as it has been a slow night. They don't anticipate all the other bodies that arrive with hers, and find any excuse to not work on her. As Michael stalks through the hospital dispatching everyone who works there systematically, no one wonders why everyone is missing. Loomis is ordered out of the city and back to the psychiatric hospital, and while being escorted away by the Marshal (John Zenda), he makes a startling realization about Laurie and her relationship with Michael. He returns to the hospital with the Marshal and his assistant (Nancy Stephens) to find the hospital deserted off personal and only Laurie left alive. After a series of skillful escapes, they trap Michael in the gas room and blow up the hospital. The Good News This is the most graphic of the sequels, partly because there are so many kills in here. We have a nice shot of a melted face, a hammer-smashed skull, a needle sticking out of an eye, and shrapnel fragments embedded in the face. Michael also gets his eyes shot out, but only the blood flow from it is seen. He also slashes a throat, but that is a moot point considering the other kills. While I'm thinking of it, I would like to comment on the needle scene. We never see the needle thrust in, just the after-affect, but that whole sequence is a prime example of how true horror films use mood to get scares. A nurse wanders into a doctors' office to call him in for duty, but his back is turned and he doesn't respond to his name. The nurse walks up to him and turns the chair around to see him dead. She silently staggers back out of the room, but behind her in the dark, Michael's mask slowly forms above her head. He lunges at her and plants another needle in her face. It is a brilliant sequence that has quickly become one of my favorites because of three classic elements The low lighting in the room, the innocent victim, and the killer's appearance in the scene. These three elements come together to form the scene. With the low lighting in the room, shadows are cast around, allowing for Michael to easily hide in. the helpless victim is his target, and the slow formation of his mask behind her are very chilling upon first watch. This scene alone is worth the price of admission, but what guarantees it is the nude scenes of the nurse played by Pamela Susan Shoop. She has a very nice body for that time, and the scene is pretty tasteful, without it being done simply for the sake of showing nudity. Following a classic slasher rule, she is immediately killed for doing so, and her death is another highlight. I don't want to give too much away, but it is a great scene that is very eerie. After dispatching her companion, Michael secretly turns up the temperature in the therapeutic pool where they are, and comes out to Shoop, who believes it is her companion. She talks to him for several seconds, then asks him a question, and when he doesn't respond, she looks up at him and sees that it isn't Michael, who promptly dispatches her as well. Another great highlight, as it continues on, is the discovery of Laurie and Michael's relationship. For the three of us left who don't know, Laurie is revealed to be Michael's brother who was hid from him after he was sent to prison. This is the storyline that set up `Halloween H2O' and it is discovered her. Of the entire competent cast, Pleasance as always does a respectable job as Loomis. I think he has finally come to terms with the role, and he has a lot of fun with it.         The Bad News Despite getting a top billing, Jamie is essentially wasted in the movie. She lies in her hospital bed for most of the movie, and when the staff starts disappearing, she finally wanders out and finds Michael. It wasn't a great decision to do so, as it left her out of action for most of the movie. This really is my only gripe against the movie.The Final Verdict Following such a successful film like `Halloween' is a tough act for any film, but this one manages to pull it off in strides. It is thoroughly entertaining all the way through, it isn't as graphic as it could've been, and it has a high re-watch ability factor. This is definitely the best of the sequels and is tied with part 4 as the most entertaining of the sequels. It is highly recommended to all fans of the original and slasher fans of any kind.    Rated R Graphic Violence, Graphic Language, and Nudity.

It is not a very dated film, it was unpredictable, and was and still is relevant in society. It is done very well and carries an important message. Although there is a political point involved, it is not a boring movie and it is fun to watch.Despite the fact that the movie was written and filmed more than half a century ago, many of the events that occur in it are ageless. For instance, when the spaceship lands there is an intense curiosity from everyone in the world, and everyone wants to know who or what is inside and where they come from. A huge crowd gathers around the ship and every radio and television station across the world is busy trying to get the latest scoop from the government about what is happening. Many viewers scoff at the foolishness of the crowd thoughtlessly gathering around a potentially dangerous area, even though if the same situation occurred in the present day the very same viewers who laughed at the people gathered around the spaceship would be in the same type of group avidly awaiting a sign of life from the shuttle. When the space shuttle comes speeding around the world and finally stops in Washington D.C., the viewer does not know what would step out or if anything is going to happen. And when the alien escapes from the hospital and goes wandering around the city, it is not apparent what he wanted or where he was going. When Klaatu dies, the viewer does not know whether it was the end of the story, and it is hard to guess what Ms. Benson saying the words to Gort will do. I also like the fact that the ending is not obvious from the beginning. When the alien flies off in his space ship he leaves the world with a serious choice, 'stop fighting or be obliterated'. This is not a decision that can be put off or ignored. The ending does not clarify which choice the world will make and the end is a cliffhanger of sorts. The political significance of this movie was relevant when it was made and is still applicable today. The movie portrays a very important idea, the concept of a world in which there were no weapons, wars, or acts of aggression. The idea is still relevant today, but it is hard to fathom. The idea of the whole world staying peaceful forever is very idealistic, but still a good idea. It would weed out the superpower countries that lead by fear and the threat of violence, and those that lead by setting a strong example and helping other countries would become more powerful. It would be hard to realize that dream, even if the whole world began working very hard towards that purpose. Every country would want the other to destroy their weapons before they would, and no country would ever volunteer to go first. Also, a conflict between countries would eventually arise. Then the world would have to find another way to resolve its issues, which would undoubtedly be a problem, because it seems to be the only quick and effective way the many leaders of the world have come up with to solve problems permanently so far. 'The Day the Earth Stood Still' is a great science fiction movie today, even after many years of existence. The events that occurred in the movie were unrealistic, yet still portrayed in a believable fashion. The actions of the people in the movie were not dated and still what people would do today, the plot is not a generic plot like many movies made today, and the points and ideas expressed in the movie, although pertaining to politics that happened at that time, are still pertinent today. The film was well thought out and enjoyable to watch. Even when the viewer is enjoying watching, the important messages are still being put forth, leading the viewer to think instead of just lazily watching the movie.

This proves to be an interesting problem for the script to resolve which I think it does with style by the end of the movie.The characters are a little predictable and one dimensional except for the lead pair who are introduced at the start of the movie, but that's perhaps the only flaw. What I really like about this movie is that, whilst not entirely a gorefest, it still manages to kick-ass because of the flawless plot. By this I mean that there a few scenarios where you find yourself saying that's just dumb or they'd never do that etc, which is very rare nowadays in the horror\/sci-fi genre. Dramas & thrillers etc get an easy job of it because all they have to do is convince us that their reality is real-life. Horror on the other hand needs to convince that the unreality it portrays is what is real-life, and that's not always an easy task.ROTLD is funny, sick, clever and above all entertaining if you can stomache some pretty twisted content. Personally, I love it.
