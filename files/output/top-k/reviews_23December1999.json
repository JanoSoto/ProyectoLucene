But we swear, they're not really big ones. We promise. So, please read on. Thank you very much.....As the Universal logo appears, Kaufman fans enjoy the sounds of Andy's wrestling theme. The weird introduction will have the entire audiences scratching their heads, then laughing them off. Man on the Moon delivers Kaufman act after Kaufman act after Kaufman act again. Jim Carrey executes them flawlessly. The movie has spills, chills, twists, sists, fits, and telephones(you thought I was going to say something that rhymes with fits, huh?). Besides the humor aspect, Man on the Moon shows a great portrayal of a man slowly loosing his world. If you're a Kaufman fan, you know the ending; all I will say is that it was so wonderfully done, that I was fighting back a tear or two. I'm not sure how Andy's life really was, but if his family supports it, it can't be too fake. The movie is excellent.....Except for that Tony Clifton guy. What a jerk!!!

He is definitely a filmmaker worth watching. What especially liked about this movie, aside from the great cast and great music, is the way that Anderson subtly inserted objects that can only be seen if attention is paid. One example is the painting of the magnolia in Philip Baker Hall's character's house, under which it states the movie's theme, revealed during the climax Things like this have happened or something like that. No one would have been able to catch that, had attention not been paid. Also, I had difficulty trying to figure out what Jason Robard's character, Earl Partridge, and the rest of his family had to do with the game show What Do Kids Know?, until I saw the end credits of the t.v. show where it said that it was a Big Earl Partridge production in big letters. That's the only way to actually link all the character's stories together. I saw the movie with three people and I was the only one to catch that. The last thing I would like to say is to all the people who say that when it started raining frogs, it didn't make any sense. If you think that, then you didn't understand any of the movie and you wasted three hours of your life that could've been spent on an absolutely amazing movie-going experience.
