[{"date":"21 December 2012","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Dumbo (1941) **** (out of 4)One of Disney's greatest and cutest films centers on the elephant Dumbo, a small elephant with incredibly large ears. The large ears cause him to be picked on by many but with the help of his only friend, a mouse, he starts to be praised for what he can do. DUMBO is without question one of the studios greatest films and I think I'd say that it's also their very cutest. I think the characters here are among some of the best ever done for the studio and the screenplay is quite simple but it milks ever bit of emotion it can from the viewer. The most noticeable thing about watching this film today is how mean everyone in it is towards Dumbo. I'm sure most parents will be turned off by the behavior and I'm sure kids will be able to connect with Dumbo. There's no question that there's a message to be learned here and it's hard to believe that anyone could see this movie and not feel bad if they're the person picking on someone or get courage if they're the person being picked on. The story itself is quite simple and predictable but the characters from the leads to the supporting elephants to the crows are just so memorable and perfectly written. The songs here aren't quite as impressive as some of the other Disney films of this era but they're still pretty good. The animation is also quite simple but I thought this approach added for some beautiful scenes. DUMBO is clearly a film that works on so many levels and it remains one of the best of its kind.
