I will never forget the kid falling off the jungle gym and that blank (pardon my french) Meryl Streep using it against Dustin Hoffman in court. I think it is great that the two stars from this movie are still relevant today more than 30 years later. This is a classic. I think what spoke to me most about this movie was how it mirrored in subtle and not so subtle tones the changing landscape in America that really gained momentum in the 1970's. How women are more than just the roles men assign them, how men can make caring fathers, that women can and sometimes should make more money than men, how not all marriages are going to last forever, and finally how that can affect a small child. I can't say for sure but because of those struggles not so long ago, I think kids today are better prepared for divorce today. Its all around them, and there are support systems both private and public. We learned a lot from struggles that seemingly occurred ages ago. That is what I liked about Kramer vs. Kramer, it made me think as well as entertain. I am not sure that was the purpose behind this Robert Benton creation, but I think just like movies such as inherit the wind paint a picture from another time in American History and how we have changed as a people since, this movie does that as well. In that sense it also shows how much we have not changed at our core. If you haven't seen this film yet I don't think you can go wrong, and if you haven't seen it for several years check it out again, you might just find yourself thinking about this American life as well. if you like concise reviews of interesting films please read my other reviews at http\/\/raouldukeatthemovies.blogspot.com\/ ","genre":null},{"date":"20 August 2011","score":"","review":" So one of my earliest memories from childhood is seeing this movie from 1979 with my parents in the theater.

Renoir emphasizes the men being pals and patriotic, eating well, joking, and dancing, which is what Renoir as a humanist understands men wish to do instead of fight, but the lack of any substantial sense of horror and suffering makes for an unbalanced film. The suffering is almost all psychological (life away from home and wife, loneliness) but it is hardly felt, except in the part of the story with the German woman, which is very successfully told.

Every movie with creatures and monsters look like a drawing done by a juvenile using windows movie maker if you compared it with the Spielberg hit JURRASIC PARK. So let not compare shall we?In the small town Maine, there has been a horrific accident. Sheriff Hank (Brendon Gleeson) pulls out his friend out of the waters of a lake (Supposedly called Lake Placid but it's not since the name is already taken) completely devoured waist down. Chief Jack Wells (Bill Pullman) of Maine Fish and Game is called in to take a look to find out what is in the waters. Far from main in the city of New York in a museum paleontologist Kelly (Bridget Fonda) has been replaced by her boyfriend aka dropped like its hot! She is then sent out to main to examine a tooth that looks pre historic which is pulled out from the lake victim mentioned before. Kelly confirms the tooth is not a fossil and whatever creature the tooth belonged to is live and very much swimming in the Lake. Heated arguments with Sheriff Hank and Chief Jack and as usual the woman wins! She ends up heading out with them to camp in the forest for 2 days in an expedition to find the cause of all the deaths. Camping for New Yorker even in the late 90s meant a hotel or an inn with a toilet and most certainly not tents. The entire party is soon joined by rich man Hector (Oliver Platt) who has a thing to swim with the crocodiles!Evenly distributed between scary and hilarious LAKE PLACID is a sure fire hour and a half of entertainment.

There is not a chance in hell that a viewer would walk away on this movie disappointed. Please respect that this was done in 1999 with the technology available over the decade. Comparison to it with the times of today would of course make it look a shame if not.

I love animation, I love dogs and I felt sorry to hear that this film wasn't very popular when it was released, so I decided to watch it on DVD. What I got was an amazing, inspiring and heart warming animated film which turned out to be one of the best I've ever seen.I was surprised about how much I was connected to the main character Balto. Because he is portrayed as a husky-wolf hybrid, the people of Nome fear of him for being part-wolf, the wolf packs reject him for being part-husky and the other dogs make fun of him for it. As a result, he is an outcast who doesn't know where he belongs, and only relying on Boris, a goose who is afraid of heights to take care of him. I showed a lot of sympathy towards Balto because I've been in similar situations and seeing him being left out was very emotive.The story is loosely based on the true 1925 serum run in Alaska. A disease spreads onto the children of Nome and a snow storm cuts all transport from delivering medicine, so a team sled dogs are sent to pick it up. But poor Balto isn't allowed to help out because of his wolf heritage. When the team is reported missing, Balto sets off on a daring quest to rescue them and get them home safely. This shows how courageous and determined he is to get the medicine to the sick children. That said, he is a very caring character and thats another reason why I really liked him.There's a bit of peril and emotional moments in this film, but plenty of comic relief is present to ease them, mostly involving Boris and Muk and Luk (the two polar bears). I personally liked the recurring gag when Kaltag hits Star in the head for saying something random. It gave me a smile each time. And the romantic moments of Balto and his girlfriend Jenna are extremely sweet indeed. Again, I found it sympathetic when Steele (the films ruthless antagonist) tries to spoil things for Balto by bullying him and trying to take Jenna from him.I found the animation to be very well done. With nice character designs and detailed Alaskan backdrops, all of which are well-drawn and gently animated, it allows to show how much work and effort Amblimation put into this traditionally animated masterpiece. James Horner's music is very atmospheric and dramatic and I liked how there were no random musical numbers to interrupt its flow.The voice acting is just as great. Bob Hoskins (as Boris) and Bridget Fonda (as Jenna) do a good job while Phil Collins voices Muk and Luk adorably and Jim Cummings is great as evil Steele. However, I would have to commend Kevin Bacon's performance for Balto. He voiced Balto sensibly. Not overacting, bland or hip, but he gave the character a more of a calm, humble, shy and likable personality similar to mine. Its another similarity me and Balto have.In conclusion, I would have to say that I absolutely adored Balto, and thats because of its great animation, story, casting and a protagonist who I could really relate to. I'm glad that I found out about this underrated classic and its a good thing others have too. If you like animation or dogs and you haven't seen it already, then I believe that Balto well deserves your attention. You will fall in love with it just like I did.Grade A ","genre":null},{"date":"20 August 2011","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" I was only one year old when Balto got released in theaters, but I didn't even hear about its existence until recently.

I love animation, I love dogs and I felt sorry to hear that this film wasn't very popular when it was released, so I decided to watch it on DVD. What I got was an amazing, inspiring and heart warming animated film which turned out to be one of the best I've ever seen.I was surprised about how much I was connected to the main character Balto. Because he is portrayed as a husky-wolf hybrid, the people of Nome fear of him for being part-wolf, the wolf packs reject him for being part-husky and the other dogs make fun of him for it. As a result, he is an outcast who doesn't know where he belongs, and only relying on Boris, a goose who is afraid of heights to take care of him. I showed a lot of sympathy towards Balto because I've been in similar situations and seeing him being left out was very emotive.The story is loosely based on the true 1925 serum run in Alaska. A disease spreads onto the children of Nome and a snow storm cuts all transport from delivering medicine, so a team sled dogs are sent to pick it up. But poor Balto isn't allowed to help out because of his wolf heritage. When the team is reported missing, Balto sets off on a daring quest to rescue them and get them home safely. This shows how courageous and determined he is to get the medicine to the sick children. That said, he is a very caring character and thats another reason why I really liked him.There's a bit of peril and emotional moments in this film, but plenty of comic relief is present to ease them, mostly involving Boris and Muk and Luk (the two polar bears). I personally liked the recurring gag when Kaltag hits Star in the head for saying something random. It gave me a smile each time. And the romantic moments of Balto and his girlfriend Jenna are extremely sweet indeed. Again, I found it sympathetic when Steele (the films ruthless antagonist) tries to spoil things for Balto by bullying him and trying to take Jenna from him.I found the animation to be very well done.

He was a police detective who upheld the law in any situation as he chased down criminals and became the love interest of many a dame. In the film, Warren Beatty plays Tracy as he runs around the city trying to catch Big Boy Caprice, played by Al Pacino, and bring him and his vast gang of crooks to justice. Madonna plays Breatless Mahoney, a night club singer who is involved with Big Boy and constantly vies for Tracy's love, promising him information about the gang if she gets what she wants. This plot might not seem very original, and that's because it's not. But there is something strange and unique about Dick Tracy that, in a way, actually makes it work.Like I said, I'm not familiar with the character or the comic strip he is from, but I feel like Warren Beatty was trying to capture an extremely specific look with this film. This is obvious through the camera angles and the colors which they accentuate. Also, the look of the buildings is very cartoonish and the villains of the film are exaggerated in a very cartoonish manner. There are lots of prosthetics in the film for each and every gangster that gives all of them a very specific look. I found this annoying and stupid at first, but it eventually grew on me as I saw the direction that this film was going. This is in no way a dark film. It's very upbeat and plays up a very specific cartoon atmosphere. I think that the film really did, in the end, capture the look it was going for.Now, if there's one word to describe Dick Tracy, it's campy. This film is one big tongue-in-cheek camp adventure. Again, it was something I wasn't terribly fond of at first, but it eventually grew on me and by the end of the film I was pretty amused by the way the film worked. Overall this is really just a very strange film. It shoots for a very specific atmosphere with its look, its humor, and the level of its campiness. It isn't something that I'm going to be terribly fond of and overall this film doesn't do much for me.

The innocent townspeople suffered at the hands and gun of the outlaw until the heroic lawman confiscated his gun, cuffed his hands, or in some cases shot him dead, not unlike the young knight saving the Princess from the villain in a Chivalric Romance. Instead of swords the characters wield 6-shooters. But High Noon is different. Here good and evil are more blurred, and the issue of indifference in the face of danger becomes the all-encompassing theme. Instead of a chivalric heroism, High Noon is a morality tale which has more in common with Shakespeare and even Greek tragedy than with knighthood romance. The script also served as a metaphor for the Hollywood Red Scare\/Blacklisting which was a result of McCarthyism during that time. High Noon, one of the few films regarded as both a classic and a masterpiece, inspired many later films and television, such as the morally ambiguous Sergio Leone Westerns of the 1960's, which would also star Lee van Cleef, who finally gets to talk! It would also inspire the television series 24 which is also based on the idea of real time.Despite popular misconception, the term High Noon meaning either the pinnacle\/peak or the climax of a confrontation existed long before this film. The term itself dates from the late Middle Ages, and quotes from American Civil War primary sources (circa 1860's) use the phrase in the same way that it is treated in this film. The first audiences would have understood what the term meant in this context. The innovative concept which permeates the cinematic experience is having the events unfold in real time up until Noon. The first 90 minutes, from 1030am to 1200pm, are more or less 90 minutes of activity, and the audience is continually aware of the time with shots of different clocks and timepieces through this period which takes up about 75% of the movie.The plot is deceptively simple which paves the way for much more complex thematic and even psychological underpinnings. Will Kane, played by Gary Cooper in an Oscar-winning tour-de-force performance, learns on his wedding day about the return of a bona fide killer, Frank Miller, recently released from prison. Kane had apparently incarcerated him, and Frank Miller is now on a train scheduled to arrive in town where his three associates are waiting for him at the depot. (One of his associates, who remains silent the entire time except for a harmonica, is played by a very young Lee van Cleef!) Kane had been the town Marshall but upon his wedding decided to voluntarily retire. However, the new Marshall was not scheduled to arrive until the next day. Kane resolves he must stay in the town and confront Miller, despite the protests of the townspeople. He solicits volunteer deputies for the task but the townspeople appear indifferent to the plight.One of the most intriguing aspects of this film is the ambiguity. Although most of the town agrees that Frank Miller is a killer and outlaw, a few thrived under the anarchy of Miller, such as the owner of the local hotel who complains his business suffered when Kane moved in and stopped Miller. Which points to another interesting innovation the film gradually reveals back-story but only as much as the characters decide to disclose. Only by the time Noon arrives has the audience put together the pieces of the larger puzzle. Even when we the audience first learn of the coming confrontation, there is much which remains concealed.The main reasons the film works as well it does is because of the outstanding script, the believability of all the actors, and the compelling camera work which paints a very different image on its cinematic canvas. The scenes are shot rather starkly in front of a seeming cloudless sky. Periodically, we see the railroad tracks going off into the distance, knowing only that it is from these tracks something menacing will arrive. Cooper is absolutely outstanding, his performance so subtle and underplayed it appears effortless but simultaneously absolutely believable. The dialog is for the most part right on the money, never lapsing into cliché. Characters talk very little about the dilemma and are often reluctant to tell what they know. The Mexican woman who had been involved with both Miller and later Kane as part of the back-story is asked about what she knows from Kane's bride but refuses. High Noon is a suspense film rather than a straightforward Western, which was one of its criticism early on but has over time become its strength. The subject could have been easily a film noir set in the 1940's with a killer arriving on a train into a city. But I think the starkness of a Midwestern American town circa 1870 gives the whole story a feeling of unease. Because the story relies more on drama and anticipation than pure action, High Noon rises above the fray and into the realm of drama which explores the tragic human condition. In this case, the tragedy is not one of unjustified death but the inability of humans to act courageously in the face of evil.

Kane had been the town Marshall but upon his wedding decided to voluntarily retire. However, the new Marshall was not scheduled to arrive until the next day. Kane resolves he must stay in the town and confront Miller, despite the protests of the townspeople. He solicits volunteer deputies for the task but the townspeople appear indifferent to the plight.One of the most intriguing aspects of this film is the ambiguity. Although most of the town agrees that Frank Miller is a killer and outlaw, a few thrived under the anarchy of Miller, such as the owner of the local hotel who complains his business suffered when Kane moved in and stopped Miller. Which points to another interesting innovation the film gradually reveals back-story but only as much as the characters decide to disclose. Only by the time Noon arrives has the audience put together the pieces of the larger puzzle. Even when we the audience first learn of the coming confrontation, there is much which remains concealed.The main reasons the film works as well it does is because of the outstanding script, the believability of all the actors, and the compelling camera work which paints a very different image on its cinematic canvas. The scenes are shot rather starkly in front of a seeming cloudless sky. Periodically, we see the railroad tracks going off into the distance, knowing only that it is from these tracks something menacing will arrive. Cooper is absolutely outstanding, his performance so subtle and underplayed it appears effortless but simultaneously absolutely believable. The dialog is for the most part right on the money, never lapsing into cliché. Characters talk very little about the dilemma and are often reluctant to tell what they know. The Mexican woman who had been involved with both Miller and later Kane as part of the back-story is asked about what she knows from Kane's bride but refuses. High Noon is a suspense film rather than a straightforward Western, which was one of its criticism early on but has over time become its strength. The subject could have been easily a film noir set in the 1940's with a killer arriving on a train into a city. But I think the starkness of a Midwestern American town circa 1870 gives the whole story a feeling of unease. Because the story relies more on drama and anticipation than pure action, High Noon rises above the fray and into the realm of drama which explores the tragic human condition. In this case, the tragedy is not one of unjustified death but the inability of humans to act courageously in the face of evil. ","genre":"Western"},{"date":"20 August 2011","score":"3 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" During the 1940's and early 1950's, the typical film Western was a cookie-cutter escapist story, usually involving a bad guy in a black hat, and a heroic good guy in a white hat. The innocent townspeople suffered at the hands and gun of the outlaw until the heroic lawman confiscated his gun, cuffed his hands, or in some cases shot him dead, not unlike the young knight saving the Princess from the villain in a Chivalric Romance. Instead of swords the characters wield 6-shooters. But High Noon is different. Here good and evil are more blurred, and the issue of indifference in the face of danger becomes the all-encompassing theme. Instead of a chivalric heroism, High Noon is a morality tale which has more in common with Shakespeare and even Greek tragedy than with knighthood romance. The script also served as a metaphor for the Hollywood Red Scare\/Blacklisting which was a result of McCarthyism during that time. High Noon, one of the few films regarded as both a classic and a masterpiece, inspired many later films and television, such as the morally ambiguous Sergio Leone Westerns of the 1960's, which would also star Lee van Cleef, who finally gets to talk! It would also inspire the television series 24 which is also based on the idea of real time.Despite popular misconception, the term High Noon meaning either the pinnacle\/peak or the climax of a confrontation existed long before this film. The term itself dates from the late Middle Ages, and quotes from American Civil War primary sources (circa 1860's) use the phrase in the same way that it is treated in this film. The first audiences would have understood what the term meant in this context. The innovative concept which permeates the cinematic experience is having the events unfold in real time up until Noon. The first 90 minutes, from 1030am to 1200pm, are more or less 90 minutes of activity, and the audience is continually aware of the time with shots of different clocks and timepieces through this period which takes up about 75% of the movie.The plot is deceptively simple which paves the way for much more complex thematic and even psychological underpinnings. Will Kane, played by Gary Cooper in an Oscar-winning tour-de-force performance, learns on his wedding day about the return of a bona fide killer, Frank Miller, recently released from prison. Kane had apparently incarcerated him, and Frank Miller is now on a train scheduled to arrive in town where his three associates are waiting for him at the depot. (One of his associates, who remains silent the entire time except for a harmonica, is played by a very young Lee van Cleef!) Kane had been the town Marshall but upon his wedding decided to voluntarily retire. However, the new Marshall was not scheduled to arrive until the next day.
