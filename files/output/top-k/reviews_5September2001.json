Among all the themes which possibly is launched onto this film, the most prominent one from viewers' point is that of lesbian triangle relationship (whether this was intended or not is another matter).  You do not need me to tell this.  As far as this love triangle theme is concerned, there's little we don't know about.  You even wonder, Did it really have to be lesbians?The acting, as I am not a professional critic, I hesitate to comment.  But I must say, Ally Sheedy and Patricia Clarkson were quite convincing, while  Radha Mitchell was not. As for the rest (Lucy's friends and Syd's colleague at FRAME), no harm done (far from impressive but not much to complain).  They probably were loyal to the script.  This leads to my next point.The script could have been a bit more interesting.  The tension, struggle, strong feelings, all of these were no more than a normal soap opera dialog.  I won't complain about the predictability of the whole story, as I don't think the it was supposed to be unpredictable. Everyone knows right from the beginning that Batman will sort out the trouble at the end, and we won't complain, do we?  But the dialog! Please be more artistic!As for the adult content aspect well probably it deserves a R for drug scenes, but for sexuality, it's no more than PG (but would not help your kid by any means).  So if you ever think you're in for a soft porn type of treatment, you can forget it.Whether this is art, whether this film is beautiful in any ways, well this is an extremely subjective matter.  I would not call this art in a conventional way (i.e. no creativity), neither would I call this beautiful.  The setting it depicts is ugly, and yet the film does not want to make it look ugly.  Put it another way, the feminine touch enabled dirty scenes to be tolerable.  Put it yet another way, it's quite boring.Over an hour and a half was too long to go through.  I would not encourage you to see this if you had other options.  Neither would I recommend this to you if you were expecting something sexually intriguing.  Don't be tricked by the cover of the video and the rating!  If you were looking for something intellectually challenging, this not for you.

I believe this to be true because although it seems any moron with a camera can stalk a would be victim and try to psyche the audience out by shaking a few trees, then flagitiously embellish the film with blood instead of atmosphere, true fear is difficult to capture on film.  I think we have all seen films that lay it on pretty thick but ultimately fail.  I truly believe you can hire someone to make a dummy and stuff it with blood and even some rudimentary designs of intestines and hearts and various other functioning organs that have the ability to make the squeamish cover their eyes.  But if you remember some of the greats, some of the icons of the trade, you will see that a good horror film is more about minacious shadows, the vicissitudes of lights, the ominous and foreboding music and finally the brilliant sagaciousness of the story.  I think many people overlook the relevance of a story in the horror movie genre.  Many inferior films like I Know What You Did Last Summer and Idle Hands and such will present us with a half-assed story and then try to build on it by bombastically insulting us with the banalities of gore and other not so shocking elements.  But what they forget is most horror films that either succeed or develop a cult following are films that somewhere along the way hit a nerve in the collective mindset of their viewers.  Friday the 13th's attack the very foundation of one of adolescent's unadulterated joys, that being camping.  Halloween invaded our trick or treaters and Nightmare On Elm Street surreptitiously alienated our dreams.  In short, we were not safe from these abominations on any front. Angel Heart follows that trend.Spoilers Ahead... if you have not seen this film, do not read from here on out.The basic premise of Angel Heart is a detective story at heart.  This is a 40's style film noir complete with rain soaked streets, seedy detectives and lots of questionable characters.  We meet Harry Angel ( Roarke) as he is taking a phone call from a stranger.  This stranger is from the law firm Winesap and MacIntosh ( any similarities here?  think about it).  They would like to meet with him as they have a client that is familiar with his work. The client's name is Monsieur Louis Cypher.Is your client foreign?  Is he a foreign gentleman?Harry then travels to a church ( strange enough place to meet a client who wants to hire a detective) where he enters the room and is first greeted by Winesap (who looks a lot like Stephen Tobolwolski), and then he sees his client.  But what we see first is long, perfectly manicured finger nails, a strange cane, a ring that has either the star of David in the middle of it or a strange cult like pointed symbol, you decide.  Also, the client's hair is put up in a bun and the man dressed impeccably.  The man does not rise to shake Harry's hand.  But he smiles with a diabolical, factitious grin that seems warm and inviting but reeks with deceit.Harry then gets the facts of the case and is told that he will be searching for a crooner that owed Louis some money but disappeared during the war. So in essence, all Louis wants from Harry is to find out if this crooner is alive or dead.  Cypher offers him a lot of money to find the guy and so Harry accepts.You must want this guy pretty bad, Harry says with a chuckle.I don't like messy accounts, Cypher replies dead-seriously.And then just before the meeting concludes, Louis says to Harry,I've got a funny feeling we've met before.  Harry has no recollection of ever meeting the man, and he would remember seeing how Cypher sticks out like a sore thumb.From here Harry goes on a labyrinthine journey to find out what happened to this crooner.  It takes him from Coney Island to New Orleans.  And along the way, dead bodies begin to show up.  First he interviews a doctor that had something to do with the case.  He shows up dead in the next scene.  Next we see an old guitar player named Toot Sweet and then he shows up dead, strangled with a part of the body meant for pissing with.  Now Harry is a suspect in two murders and it just keeps getting worse.Every 20 minutes Louis Cypher shows up to check on his progress.  And every time he does, more strange religion seems to get introduced to the plot. This French gentleman is obviously a fanatical, devout, religious iconoclast.  He is not just seeking this missing person for personal accounts, it seems more like a reckoning.  And the further Harry gets into the mystery, the more liable he is to be implicated in things that he had nothing to do with.  To make matters worse, Cypher tells him that he has old fashioned and bucolic ideas about justice, You know, an eye for an eye, that sort of thing.  Finally Harry, in desperation, asks him in one of their sittings, Who the @^&* are you Cypher?  Cypher's reply, Watch your language, this is a church.By now the film has us both intrigued with it's eccentric and neurotic characters, and confused in some ways by the abstruse manner in which the story is unfolding.  This apparent confusion is by design, because this film takes pride in laying the foundation out for us but not the glue.  We have to use our heads to figure things out and that is rare in many films, especially the horror genre.  That may sound contradictory to what we are all lead to believe about most horror, but it is true.  Horror, true horror has gone the way of the do-do bird.  It is all but extinct.  Angel Heart however, is more of a heterodoxy than one might think.  It takes all that is good with the genre and makes it even better.  Every scene in this film seems to quietly show us another piece to the puzzle.  Every twist and turn seems to unravel the story like the layers of an onion.  Without giving away the plot and the secrets to the film, here are a few scenes to digest and think about.Take for instance the not so subliminal use fans in the film.  Every time Louis Cypher is in the room, fans are first shown.  This is relevant in some scenes because of the heat, but what about on a cold blustery day in the Bronx?Also examine some of the intriguing lines that slither out of DeNiro's mouth.  Lines like, They say there is just enough religion in the world to make man hate one another, but not enough to make them love. Or Would you like an egg Mr. Angel?  After Harry says no, Cypher replies, you know, they say the egg represents the soul.  He then bites into the egg and chews it with perfect equanimity.  You can never tell if Cypher is mad or satisfied.  All we know is this man is here to find a missing person. Some of the time he cracks a smile but what he is really smiling about is just somewhere underneath the surface.There are also a few times when Harry catches a glimpse of himself in the mirror but he sees two images of himself, the mirror is cracked or split or mangled in some way.  And he always looks pensive and confused when he looks into the mirror as though he sees something.... but then forgets it.We are also privy to scenes that are ripe with contradictions.  Bullets are stored in a Bible, a nun is cleaning blood off the wall, a priest wants to drive in a Rolls Royce, a heart is cut out, almost like a butcher did it and took pride in his work and a few other images that confuse yet enlighten you at the same time.  Angel Heart is the true working of a paradox in progress.The climax of Angel Heart is one that will have you shell shocked.  I wasn't prepared for it when I saw this film as a 17 year-old and even now when I am pushing 30 and have seen the film over 100 times, I am still in awe when I watch Harry and Louis banter about as Louis tells him of his ultimate fate.Alas.  How terrible is wisdom when it brings no profit to the wise Johnny.My name's not Johnny.I know who I am.  Cypher I know who I am!When all is about to be revealed, Louis tells Johnny to take a good look in the mirror because no matter how cleverly you sneak up on a mirror, you reflection always looks you straight in the eye.  And when he does, all that we didn't know but may have suspected, is now revealed to us.Angel Heart is not the type of horror film that will scare you every five minutes with ghosts that bounce balls down stairs or with pumpkin candles that flicker coyly enough to see a shadow float across the ceiling.  But what it will do is turn your insides upside down with the promise that something pernicious and final is about to take place.  Angel Heart is opulent with undertones of doom and sumptuous with forbidden overtones. Just as Blair Witch attacked us with what could be there, Angel Heart admonishes us to stay away from things that should not be there.  Harry Angel has entered into an inchoate project and it is one that he will wish he never sought out in the first place.This is one of the best films I have ever seen, and along with Halloween and Jaws, not only does this film rank highly on the horror charts, it cross polinates into the top films ever made.  I am not sure where I would put this film because to compare a film like JFK and Raiders of the Lost Ark with an atmospheric, spine tingling film like this is like comparing a top of the line BMW to a top of the line Jaguar.  Where do you start and how do you stipulate which is better.  All I know is that this film made me fear what it warns us about.  And it made me interested to read the Bible again. That has to count for something.  After all, the Bible is filled with stories of fire, brimstone, people turning to stone and burning bushes and deceit and betrayal.  Sounds like fun, doesn't it?10 out of 10-- This is the epitome of horror and if you have not seen this film, I urge you to find it and watch it this weekend.  Mickey Roarke and Robert Deniro are priceless and keep in mind, this is brought to you by the same team that gave us films like T-2, First Blood and Basic Instinct. This was a different kind of film for Kassar and Vajna and I am thankful they decided to take a chance on a dark film like this.

Cypher offers him a lot of money to find the guy and so Harry accepts.You must want this guy pretty bad, Harry says with a chuckle.I don't like messy accounts, Cypher replies dead-seriously.And then just before the meeting concludes, Louis says to Harry,I've got a funny feeling we've met before.  Harry has no recollection of ever meeting the man, and he would remember seeing how Cypher sticks out like a sore thumb.From here Harry goes on a labyrinthine journey to find out what happened to this crooner.  It takes him from Coney Island to New Orleans.  And along the way, dead bodies begin to show up.  First he interviews a doctor that had something to do with the case.  He shows up dead in the next scene.  Next we see an old guitar player named Toot Sweet and then he shows up dead, strangled with a part of the body meant for pissing with.  Now Harry is a suspect in two murders and it just keeps getting worse.Every 20 minutes Louis Cypher shows up to check on his progress.  And every time he does, more strange religion seems to get introduced to the plot. This French gentleman is obviously a fanatical, devout, religious iconoclast.  He is not just seeking this missing person for personal accounts, it seems more like a reckoning.  And the further Harry gets into the mystery, the more liable he is to be implicated in things that he had nothing to do with.  To make matters worse, Cypher tells him that he has old fashioned and bucolic ideas about justice, You know, an eye for an eye, that sort of thing.  Finally Harry, in desperation, asks him in one of their sittings, Who the @^&* are you Cypher?  Cypher's reply, Watch your language, this is a church.By now the film has us both intrigued with it's eccentric and neurotic characters, and confused in some ways by the abstruse manner in which the story is unfolding.  This apparent confusion is by design, because this film takes pride in laying the foundation out for us but not the glue.  We have to use our heads to figure things out and that is rare in many films, especially the horror genre.  That may sound contradictory to what we are all lead to believe about most horror, but it is true.  Horror, true horror has gone the way of the do-do bird.  It is all but extinct.  Angel Heart however, is more of a heterodoxy than one might think.  It takes all that is good with the genre and makes it even better.  Every scene in this film seems to quietly show us another piece to the puzzle.  Every twist and turn seems to unravel the story like the layers of an onion.  Without giving away the plot and the secrets to the film, here are a few scenes to digest and think about.Take for instance the not so subliminal use fans in the film.  Every time Louis Cypher is in the room, fans are first shown.  This is relevant in some scenes because of the heat, but what about on a cold blustery day in the Bronx?Also examine some of the intriguing lines that slither out of DeNiro's mouth.  Lines like, They say there is just enough religion in the world to make man hate one another, but not enough to make them love. Or Would you like an egg Mr. Angel?  After Harry says no, Cypher replies, you know, they say the egg represents the soul.  He then bites into the egg and chews it with perfect equanimity.  You can never tell if Cypher is mad or satisfied.  All we know is this man is here to find a missing person. Some of the time he cracks a smile but what he is really smiling about is just somewhere underneath the surface.There are also a few times when Harry catches a glimpse of himself in the mirror but he sees two images of himself, the mirror is cracked or split or mangled in some way.  And he always looks pensive and confused when he looks into the mirror as though he sees something.... but then forgets it.We are also privy to scenes that are ripe with contradictions.  Bullets are stored in a Bible, a nun is cleaning blood off the wall, a priest wants to drive in a Rolls Royce, a heart is cut out, almost like a butcher did it and took pride in his work and a few other images that confuse yet enlighten you at the same time.  Angel Heart is the true working of a paradox in progress.The climax of Angel Heart is one that will have you shell shocked.  I wasn't prepared for it when I saw this film as a 17 year-old and even now when I am pushing 30 and have seen the film over 100 times, I am still in awe when I watch Harry and Louis banter about as Louis tells him of his ultimate fate.Alas.  How terrible is wisdom when it brings no profit to the wise Johnny.My name's not Johnny.I know who I am.  Cypher I know who I am!When all is about to be revealed, Louis tells Johnny to take a good look in the mirror because no matter how cleverly you sneak up on a mirror, you reflection always looks you straight in the eye.  And when he does, all that we didn't know but may have suspected, is now revealed to us.Angel Heart is not the type of horror film that will scare you every five minutes with ghosts that bounce balls down stairs or with pumpkin candles that flicker coyly enough to see a shadow float across the ceiling.  But what it will do is turn your insides upside down with the promise that something pernicious and final is about to take place.  Angel Heart is opulent with undertones of doom and sumptuous with forbidden overtones. Just as Blair Witch attacked us with what could be there, Angel Heart admonishes us to stay away from things that should not be there.  Harry Angel has entered into an inchoate project and it is one that he will wish he never sought out in the first place.This is one of the best films I have ever seen, and along with Halloween and Jaws, not only does this film rank highly on the horror charts, it cross polinates into the top films ever made.  I am not sure where I would put this film because to compare a film like JFK and Raiders of the Lost Ark with an atmospheric, spine tingling film like this is like comparing a top of the line BMW to a top of the line Jaguar.  Where do you start and how do you stipulate which is better.  All I know is that this film made me fear what it warns us about.  And it made me interested to read the Bible again. That has to count for something.  After all, the Bible is filled with stories of fire, brimstone, people turning to stone and burning bushes and deceit and betrayal.  Sounds like fun, doesn't it?10 out of 10-- This is the epitome of horror and if you have not seen this film, I urge you to find it and watch it this weekend.  Mickey Roarke and Robert Deniro are priceless and keep in mind, this is brought to you by the same team that gave us films like T-2, First Blood and Basic Instinct. This was a different kind of film for Kassar and Vajna and I am thankful they decided to take a chance on a dark film like this.  Add Alan Parker to this brilliant behind the scenes team and you have all the ingredients for one hell of a ride.

This is his first commercial film (still was small, independent, and low budget). While Matewan or others may have been better films, I think this is a good second place offering from such a talented director. I'm so excited that this film is finally out on DVD. I can see the facial expressions on Joe Mortons face so much clearer, it reminds me of when I saw it in the theatre over 15 years ago. This is definitely one of my favorite movies of all time (out of many thousands)! It has so much in it of commentaries about American life, including of course race and cultures. But it goes much deeper than that. Wildly entertaining and funny, while also being a tense thriller at times about someone on the run from the bad authorities. The story is about a run-away slave or convict who has escaped in a spaceship and crash landed on earth, arriving on Ellis Island. A new twist on the meaning of illegal alien. He sneaks on the boat to shore and begins exploring New York City, learning fast this strange but wonderful culture (that of mid-1980s New York City- which was a wonderfully rich culture). He ends up spending some of his extra time in a run-down bar in Harlem, where the regular clientele expound the wisdom of the ages while they try to figure out who this guy is that can't talk. (Joe Morton's character has no speech capability, but manages to communicate at least as well with his facial and body gestures.) Meanwhile, the bounty hunters from space are on his trail in NYC, just missing him sometimes, but getting ever closer.Speaking of characters- this film is full of more talent than any other film I can recall. That they did all this on a low budget just amazes me, because ALL the actors do such good acting. There is a lot of dialog in this film, and a large cast. Most of them have been in many films since, and got their start in this one. In addition to being in many of John Sayles' other films, David Strathairn has been in dozens of other recent films, and is a well-recognized face. Joe Morton played two of his most outstanding roles in this film, and in the cult movie Trouble in Mind. After that he has been in hot demand in Hollywood to this day. I just keep seeing him in movies, and he really deserves it- he is such a great actor! And the list goes on. Finally, the music sound track is just gorgeous- mostly light reggae, dub, and light jazz. Just wonderful, and now it is back in print too- on CD. Marvelous! ","genre":null},{"date":"5 September 2001","score":"","review":"  I think John Sayles is one of the greatest directors in America.

And, if anything, the film was overlong. If you were to ask me for a list of films that emphatically did NOT need to be any longer, Apocalypse Now would be at the very top.But what was particularly interesting at the time was that lack of cohesiveness in the first half of the movie. Coppolla had made his name in his earlier films from his ability to sketch in characters economically and well, and that was completely missing here.

With some small additions and re-structuring, the first half to two-thirds of this really are the great movie Coppolla so desperately wanted it to be, which feels and moves infinitely better than its original cut. The feeling of traveling up the river to a more grimly primordial world is palpable, and almost wholly lacking earlier.For example, the stealing of Kilgore's surfboard gives a greater sense of Willard's character, because it's a reaction to Kilgore. In the original cut, it's all passive. You never see Willard reacting to what he's experiencing, he just observes, and the portentous narration tells us what he's thinking.Unfortunately, it's still a grand failure.

The film skids to a stop in the famous French plantation scene, and the utter dramatic failure of Brando as Kurtz makes the end of this cut as unmoving, embarrassing, and boring now as it was 20 years ago. The tremendous improvement of the first two acts of the film throw into high relief how badly the last act doesn't work.I suspect Coppolla knows this, in his heart. He did lots of subtle restructuring and re-editing of the first two-thirds of the film, but virtually none in the last third. There, he just threw in the French plantation scene and an extra scene with Kurtz, and called it good.Maybe what we need is a Phantom Edit version. Maybe Willard should get up the river to a vast anti-climax, with Kurtz already dead (Mistah Kurtz, he dead), and nothing to show for the journey. That would leave a version of the film with the good bits kept and the bad bits discarded, and an ending that would work, as opposed to the one it's got, which still doesn't, and which detracts from the parts that are worthwhile.

It's often the little things that make a film work. Here are a few examplesa.) The absolute realism of the first twenty minutes of so, which are so true to life that they might have come from a documentary on how people lived in America forty years ago. There isn't a false note,--or a missed one--as each vocal inflection and raised eyebrow carries great meaning even if, on the surface, not much appears to be happening.b.) Marion and the motorcycle cop. The cop is dark and sinister in appearance, due mostly to the bright desert sun, and never takes off his sunglasses. His conduct is at all times professional; he never raises his voice, and comes across as calm and rather perceptive; and he seems truly concerned over Marion Crane's fate, though he is unaware of her actual predicament. Marion is, alas, a bad actress, and the cop sees through this, if not to the heart of the matter, yet we don't want him to follow her. Despite his appearance the cop is not the angel of death but rather Marion's last chance. Had she confessed to her crime she would have escaped the fate that awaited her; and if she had just been a little less clever, and driven more slowly, and the skies remained clear, he might have followed her to the motel and intervened on her behalf.c.) California Charlie. John Anderson is wonderful as the fast-talking, semi-streetwise small town used car salesman. At the end of almost every other line of dialogue he seems on the verge of discovering who Marion really is, then pulls back or comes to the wrong conclusion. He senses that she is being watched by the cop; but he also wants to make a sale. The scenes at the used car lot are both highly realistic,--and perfectly acted and timed--and also a little frightening, from the opening, I'm in no mood for trouble, to the final hey! just before Marion drives away. We know that something isn't right, but the problem isn't with the car lot; it's Marion's plight casts a dark shadow over all her scenes there, despite the brightest sunlight imaginable.d.) Chitchat with Norman. Once Marion and Norman settle down for a light meal in the parlor their conversation turns to general things, and Norman is a good observer, if a bit awkward socially. Without actually lying Marion gives herself away with a throwaway line (Sometimes just once is enough, in a reference to private traps) and Norman seems to catch her drift, if not the actual meaning of what she's saying, and allows it to pass. We can see that he is moody when he angrily leans forward and delivers an angry, though controlled tirade against putting people in institutions. Every camera angle and line of dialogue in this scene has meaning and carries enormous weight, and yet the drama plays out in a light, relaxed mode, and the performers seems truly connected to one another at its conclusion, strangers no more. This is in my opinion the best written and most beautifully acted, edited and photographed scene I have ever seen in a movie. The handling of every nuance is prodigal and masterful, and the end result nothing less than staggering.e.) The sheriff's house. When Sam and Lila wake up the sheriff and his wife in the middle of the night we see a splendid example of people talking to one another without either party understanding what is in fact going on. The result is a mini-comedy of manners; but it is also good exposition, as we learn of Mrs. Bates' death (and the dress she was buried in, periwinkle blue). John McInyre's sheriff dominates this scene (and no other), and expertly delivers its punchline, Well if that's Mrs. Bates in the window, who's that buried up in Greenlawn Cemetary.f.) Arbogast and Norman. The private detective's interview with Norman is played low-key, and yet we sense the tension in Norman's voice and manner, and know that Arbogast does, too. Something is amiss. This is beyond the question of who killed Marion.

Yet throughout his speech, with all its Freudian brilliance, the doctor offered a take on the story that we in the audience, even if we can accept it, can never be satisfied with. He can explain the character of Norman Bates rationally, but he cannot make our response to his story and its effect on us feel ultimately safe, feel somehow in control and finalized.

There is in fact nothing fancy about Psycho, which is on the surface is a somewhat plain-looking movie. Only when one looks beneath the surface does one see the teeming millions of small things,--gestures, glances, sudden changes in lighting, razor-sharp editing, and all above the refusal on the part of the director to let any one factor dominate--that we understand the meaning of the word genius, the meaning of the word creative.

It's often the little things that make a film work. Here are a few examplesa.) The absolute realism of the first twenty minutes of so, which are so true to life that they might have come from a documentary on how people lived in America forty years ago. There isn't a false note,--or a missed one--as each vocal inflection and raised eyebrow carries great meaning even if, on the surface, not much appears to be happening.b.) Marion and the motorcycle cop. The cop is dark and sinister in appearance, due mostly to the bright desert sun, and never takes off his sunglasses. His conduct is at all times professional; he never raises his voice, and comes across as calm and rather perceptive; and he seems truly concerned over Marion Crane's fate, though he is unaware of her actual predicament. Marion is, alas, a bad actress, and the cop sees through this, if not to the heart of the matter, yet we don't want him to follow her. Despite his appearance the cop is not the angel of death but rather Marion's last chance. Had she confessed to her crime she would have escaped the fate that awaited her; and if she had just been a little less clever, and driven more slowly, and the skies remained clear, he might have followed her to the motel and intervened on her behalf.c.) California Charlie. John Anderson is wonderful as the fast-talking, semi-streetwise small town used car salesman. At the end of almost every other line of dialogue he seems on the verge of discovering who Marion really is, then pulls back or comes to the wrong conclusion. He senses that she is being watched by the cop; but he also wants to make a sale. The scenes at the used car lot are both highly realistic,--and perfectly acted and timed--and also a little frightening, from the opening, I'm in no mood for trouble, to the final hey! just before Marion drives away. We know that something isn't right, but the problem isn't with the car lot; it's Marion's plight casts a dark shadow over all her scenes there, despite the brightest sunlight imaginable.d.) Chitchat with Norman. Once Marion and Norman settle down for a light meal in the parlor their conversation turns to general things, and Norman is a good observer, if a bit awkward socially. Without actually lying Marion gives herself away with a throwaway line (Sometimes just once is enough, in a reference to private traps) and Norman seems to catch her drift, if not the actual meaning of what she's saying, and allows it to pass. We can see that he is moody when he angrily leans forward and delivers an angry, though controlled tirade against putting people in institutions. Every camera angle and line of dialogue in this scene has meaning and carries enormous weight, and yet the drama plays out in a light, relaxed mode, and the performers seems truly connected to one another at its conclusion, strangers no more. This is in my opinion the best written and most beautifully acted, edited and photographed scene I have ever seen in a movie. The handling of every nuance is prodigal and masterful, and the end result nothing less than staggering.e.) The sheriff's house. When Sam and Lila wake up the sheriff and his wife in the middle of the night we see a splendid example of people talking to one another without either party understanding what is in fact going on. The result is a mini-comedy of manners; but it is also good exposition, as we learn of Mrs. Bates' death (and the dress she was buried in, periwinkle blue). John McInyre's sheriff dominates this scene (and no other), and expertly delivers its punchline, Well if that's Mrs. Bates in the window, who's that buried up in Greenlawn Cemetary.f.)

And herewith we'd been promised, finally, something of a 'human element', a story, something on which to grab as regards the people in this film. And quite simply, we were robbed.Instead, we find ourselves with even less of a feasible story line than in either I or II. We find some absolutely AWFUL miscasting in some of the key roles, and our heroes come down to the good professor once more (Sam Neill) without whom this series would have never survived, and only a brief appearance by his former working partner (Laura Dern), now moved on to other matters. Trevor Morgan and Alessandro Nivola provide some good supporting moments for Sam Neill, without which the film collapses entirely -- like just another flimsy protective barrier supposed to confine our dinosaurs in all three films.Macy and Leoni could NOT have found themselves more out of place than a pair of vampires on a Spring Break outing to Miami Beach.

Cool clothes, hot babes (or mansteaks depending upon your preference) and world travel. These days one barely needs talent...The cast within Rocks Star both the musicians and the actors playing musicians just don't have any oomph. It's hard for me not to love Mark Wahlberg, though.Marky Wahlberg is not only one of the cutest croissants in the bakery of man, but he's a wonderful actor. His soft-spoken, near bookish demeanor and hard crusty bits mix in a large portion of talent perfection cocktail. Sure, I'm smitten, but it's the truth. This is one of his most humorous roles yet.Jennifer Aniston is still trying to break out of her Friend's mold. She hasn't done it here, unfortunately. Her role, as Chris (Izzy)'s girlfriend could have been played by just about any starlet wondering the lot. Maybe next time she'll get some meat and dumplings to sink her perfectly shaped teeth into? It's hard to get out of the whole must see TV stuff.Rock Star is a comedy, not a brilliant comedy, that follows the rise of Chris Cole. He's a lead singer for a cover\/tribute band, Blood Pollution that drives the locals into frenzy while they emulate a real, famous, rock band Steel Dragon ; like all those tribute bands of the Grateful Dead or the Doors do even now at local dive venues to a screaming B class groupies yellin' over a quazi-karaoke night.The year is 1985, big hair, tacky clothes and cucumber bulges rule, and so does metal. Chris is very much a part of the scene. He's a semi loser during the day, drives a beat up Dart, and lives at home- 'nough said?When Christopher's unceremoniously booted from the band he lives for he's thinking life's pretty much a big old bag of rag weed you paid a premium for. That is until his phone rings and fate steps up to his microphone. He's asked to step-in for the Steel Dragon's singer, Bobby Beers (Jason Flemyng), ala the real life switch-a-roo Judas Priest pulled with leather boy, Rob Halford...Chris has suddenly become the icon people in bands around the world look to be. Neat huh? But he wants more. Snore. Chris, now known as Izzy, does the whole Mick Jagger-Bowie-Poison gig and is livin the generic rock star life of legends...all while as his gal, who was always his strongest supporter, (sniff) Emily (Jennifer  I see Brad Pitt naked -anytime I want Aniston) is starting to be lost in the fog machine of life.He's rude, crude, whoring around and into drug food. She's gotta dump the creep. Oh, how quickly people forget who was there when they were beggin' for change to fill up their gas tank...He gets his ego bruised a little to though... hehehe (<-evil cackle)Rock Star's problem? There's a lack of edge, no real energy of the time is present, and few belly laughs await you, dare I say it's a Spinal Tap lite? Granted Rock Star has some great scenes, some decent acting and lots of young hot bucks in tight clothing wriggling about a stage and scantly clad felines for all the audience to enjoy. Remember Mark the actor Wahlberg was once an underwear exposing hip-hop artist ricocheting around a stage in his Calvins, grabbing his crotch to sound of screaming girls simultaneously in prayer that his stylin' oversized jeans would plummet to the floor and reveal his winky. While Rock Star's music is other end of the jukebox different, Wahlberg's had the rock star experience and he does a great (I just think it could have been even better) job of bring Chris up to a quazi-believable star. Mark did provide less of a lypsyncing-local-talent-show impersonation and managed to capture an essence of what schmoo turned icon would be reacting like. The movie itself just didn't grab you.The band Steel Dragons actually boasts real musicians with a bit of a name for themselves; the drummer is the real Jason Bonham (son of Led Zeppelin's John Bonham -second only to Moon in talent), the bassist is Dokken's guitarist Jeff Pilson, and Third Eye Blind's lead singer, Stephan Jenkins plays a rival bands lead singer. So there's tasty treats for the diehard music folks sprinkled in the audience.Often I thought of Spinal Tap, the quintessential rock star mock and wishes for Nigel (Christopher Guest) to pop up backstage arguing about finger sandwiches and the evils of bread crust...it never happened.In the end , Rock Star is a big old metaphor for how important it is to be yourself. To find your own voice. Sure Chris\/Izzy's made it big, filling the shoes of Steel Dragon's ex-singer. Somebody who already paved the road, so the fans aren't really gushing over Chris at all. That's gonna effect your psyche eventually huh? He's an artist after all...Rock Star is also a chance for some rock and roll nostalgia. Not just for the fond memory of the ridiculously made-up boys of the eighties, but for those shapely men in their super tight custom leather performing a kind of bare chested ballet to screaming guitars and half hour long drum riffs. If your one of them rush and see this...if not wait for rental.Snack recommendation Beer and donuts, while reviewing Boogie Nights just one more time...
