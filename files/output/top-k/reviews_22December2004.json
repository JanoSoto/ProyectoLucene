I didn't see this movie for approximately a decade because it had the reputation, still held in most quarters, of being one of the most infamous bombs of recent memory. However, despite my initial indifference I caught it - by complete accident - on free-to-air TV one night and was immediately hooked from the first sight of its memorable, unexpected future-baroque production design. From that point on, being led through the strange world of the Emperor and his entourage on Kaitain, the oddly-garbed Bene Gesserit Sisterhood, and the Guild Navigator emissaries in all their variously-staged mutated splendour, I was hopelessly infatuated with all things DUNE. Now, I am fully aware that by most conventional definitions DUNE is not a good film. Actually, since having read all the books in the DUNE saga I am astonished to think that anybody thought that such a property could ever be a commercially viable option for mainstream cinema. It has concepts that tend to demand your full attention, which is mostly box office poison. However I loved the sheer scope of it, the fact that I was being bombarded with scores of unfamiliar terms and concepts which to me had always been the essence of pure science fiction. That it made for a choppy and often confusing cinematic experience mattered to me not at all. I was too much in love with the idea of it all and the weird, alien ambiance which only Lynch could have given the movie. Atreides, Harkonnens, Mentats, Fremen, Sandworms - I just wanted more, more, more. Superb cast, alluring music, stunning visuals - all contributing to an uncommonly arresting, unquestionably unique, cinematic experience.For all its failures I can't even imagine what any contemporary of Lynch might have done with the material. My point is this David Lynch's DUNE, warts and all, made me excited enough to want to read all the books in Herbert's sprawling saga. These volumes had been around for years. I'd seen them gathering dust in my local public library yet I felt no compulsion to read them. After seeing DUNE I couldn't wait to rush down and grab them off the shelves. That's why I'll always defend the film and why I refuse to write it off as the disastrous failure that so many regard it to be. In my mind DUNE is a success because it completely sold me on Frank Herbert's universe - a no more strangely beautiful, intellectually stimulating nor fascinating one had I ever seen on film - and compelled me to go ever further into it. I do accept most of the criticisms that the casual moviegoer has of the film but I simply can't hate it. In short, if you are curious about the film and are familiar with all the bad and discouraging press it has received over the years, yet remain a fan of exceptional fantasy or science fiction, do not be discouraged. You may find that it has elements that may just move you, bewilder you, or tantalise your imagination. You may come to agree, like a growing number of us, that it really is not so deserving of the excoriation that it has suffered at the hands - or pens - of its harshest critics. If you go into it with a forgiving mindset then you may be well rewarded. And then - if you haven't already - read the saga itself. It is formidably great!

It is often cited as the reason that the Academy Awards started a foreign film category. Incidentally, it did win an Honorary Award from the Academy for Best Foreign Film. More than a film, Rashomon is more of a meditation on this dishonest nature of man. As we listen to four different testimonies of the same heinous crime, we see that people will lie to save themselves, no matter what the circumstances. The film begins with a priest and a wood cutter speaking within a temple during a terrible rain. Their conversation is a mystery until another man arrives, and begins to ask questions about their subject matter. It is revealed that the men have just returned from court, where they gave their testimonies in a trial against a vicious bandit known as Tajomaru (Toshiro Mifune in all of his manic, savage mastery). The bandit tells his side of the story. The woman that he most-likely raped follows with her version of the truth. Then, the story takes an odd twist toward the macabre as a medium is called in to channel the spirit of the woman's murdered husband, who provides an all-together different story. Needless to say, the case is hopeless. The priest and wood cutter find themselves drowning in their own self-pity because of the horrendous state of the world. The priest lamenting that he has lost his faith in man. The other man at the temple laughs it all off, having seen too much tragedy in his lifetime to weep over the injustice which has just taken place. The film does end on a relatively upbeat tone, however. The wood cutter is given a chance to take control of life, a reminder that his life is his own, and that his decisions are still his own, even in the face of the insurmountable odds against anyone struggling to survive in his troubled times. To me, the three men at the temple are the forces of good, evil, and humanity, which is trapped in the middle. The priest is a holy man seeking virtue in a time when virtue was essentially a sign of weakness. The man who approached the wood cutter and the priest embodies the corrupted soul of man, embittered by the harsh cruelties of reality. The wood cutter, neither virtuous nor evil, is confused, and has resigned to be neutral, no matter how much it may hurt him. However, out of the midst of all of this chaos, rain, murder, rape, and perjury, hope is found, and I believe that the wood cutter takes his first step toward realizing his dream by attempting to become that which he prays for - a man of decency.This film is extraordinarily powerful. The contrast of the endless downpour at the temple and the beautiful, sun-soaked forest is magnificent, as is the cinematography on the whole. The writing and directing is wonderful, and the performances of the actors and actresses, while arguably over-the-top (note that this was the acting style being used at the time), are more powerful than anything else. Toshiro Mifune's performance was particularly striking as the remorseless bandit. Emotionally poignant performances from Machiko Kyo, Masayuki Mori, and Takashi Shimura, among others create a stirring ensemble which Kurosawa masterfully uses to weave this ancient tale (the film was based on a story called In the Grove) into a cinematic masterpiece that brought him international recognition.I would recommend this film to anyone due to the fact that I believe it to be a work of infinite cinematic value and of great philosophical significance.

Do we honestly expect that a death in a car crash is not going to be big news round a place like that? And that when Jerry sees the crash on the news he won't piece the whole thing together?? There are too many other things to mention.For someone that enjoys slow paced, character built films this is a long way down my list and I'm amazed so many people liked it.

I have to confess to never having read the original novel or ever seeing another Hound of the Baskervilles film, so this tale of mystery is completely new to me. Peter Cushing stars as the eccentric Sherlock Holmes; one of the most famous detectives ever written. He is called in when the lord of the Baskerville family is found dead on the moors, in a way that appears to be reminiscent of the way the former lord of the family was found dead. This ties in with a mythical curse on the family, which tells of a vengeful ghost known as the hound of hell. The film starts as it means to go on; with an atmospheric and mysterious telling of how the curse on the family came about and from the beginning until the end; this is a macabre, but not violent, tension filled tale of terror that is sure to keep you on the edge of your seat.Peter Cushing has had the pleasure of playing many of literature's finest characters - Baron Frankenstein and Van Helsing among others, and he brings just the right amount of eccentricity, panache and arrogance to this one; Sherlock Holmes. In fact, this is arguably his best performance ever as this role fits him like a glove. He is given excellent support by André Morell (Plague of the Zombies), who brings class to the role of Dr Watson; Sherlock Holmes' friend and fellow investigator. The fantastic Christopher Lee tops off the cast excellently, and as usual approaches his role with the great charm and charisma that horror fans have come to expect from him. Lee wasn't as big a star when this film was released as he went on to be, but I wouldn't be surprised to find that this was one of the roles (along with Count Dracula, obviously) that won him the acclaim that allowed him to go on to become the first billed star for many of Hammer's later films. Terence Fisher deserves much of the praise for the fact that this film turned out well; his rural sets and macabre atmosphere help turn this tale into a fascinating ride and he executes all the sequences wonderfully, so that the finished product is an exciting and invigorating piece of film. Well done, I say.

I think it is unfair. It is true that Malick's filmography isn't very dense but his movies are much better than Gregory Hoblit's. I would (sadely) grant without hesitation the quoted nickname to Hoblit. After a first promising movie Primal Fear (1996) which owed a lot to Edward Norton, this director kept on discrediting himself throughout each movie he made. It is not this war movie Hart's War (2002) that will try to show the contrary.I am writing to the people who didn't see this film. If you think that you deal with a war movie like Saving Private Ryan (1998) well you are wrong. Hart's War is a war movie without war! There's the share of shootings and explosions at the beginning of the movie but after that, the movie especially focuses on psychological tensions between the American soldiers. On another hand, the main star isn't Bruce Willis as the poster suggests but Colin Farrell who offers a quite impressive performance but his character remains too confined in Hollywood conventions to be really terrific. To come back to Bruce Willis, during the most important part of the film, we wonder what is his real function in the story. The answer only appears at the end of the movie (it obeys to Hoblit's will to keep the best till last) and I won't reveal it.What is wrong with Hart's War? Simply, this movie is handicapped with glaring implausibilities which deals a severe to the credibility of the plan.First the action of the film takes place in the beginning of 1945. It isn't the ideal time for this kind of story for the simple and good reason that the Second World War was almost finished in Europe. For German troops, it was the debacle and they didn't hesitate in setting the American soldiers free from the camps in which they were imprisoned.Then, the Nazis were keen on Hitler's racist theses contending the supremacy of the Aryan race and the extinction of the Jews, the black etc... But if the black American soldier was charged with murder, why didn't they kill him instead of letting Willis organizing a real trial for him? I think Hoblit tried to avoid a tempting caricature towards the German soldiers and to grant them a little light of humanity. But it is hard to believe that one of the German leaders studied in Yale and is fond of Afro-American jazz music.In another extent, the director offers a neutral and sanitized image of life of American prisoners in the camp. We see American prisoners playing cards, ball or having fun (whereas beside them there are Russian prisoners who are working). However, it is certain that life in those camps was tough and German soldiers were surely manhandling their prisoners.As for the trial, I think it is only of minor interest and Hoblit has no hesitation in denouncing racial injustices through the lieutenant Lincoln A Scott. Behind this trial, an escape plan is setting in motion and it is a hare-brained one how did the Americans manage to find the useful tools to dig their tunnel? By the way, the movie wouldn't be full without the inevitable (and very American) final moral which ends up tarnishing Hoblit's work.What have we got at the end? A poor war movie with an artificial construction and where the politically correct is de rigueur. It also testifies a sadder thing the (definitve?) loss of a talent Gregory Hoblit.

In the film, we learn rather quickly that race car driver Jim Douglas(Dean Jones) has hit rock bottom after being a prominent race car driver(what caused his demise? it's not explained but it appears that he got into quite a few bang ups). He lives with a Buddhist named Tennessee Steinmetz(Buddy Hackett)who finds a soul in everything.Jim soon looks for a new car and comes across a fancy dealership, only to be embarrassed by the owner Peter Thorndyke(David Tomlinson) who refuses Jim's $80 offer for a gorgeous race car. While in the showroom, a VW rolls in that was supposed to be scrapped. As Thorndyke berates the little car, Jim sticks up for it and soon the car thinks it has a friend and follows Jim home. To avoid being blamed for stealing the car, Jim agrees to buy it from Thorndyke but the car acts up. Jim is about to return it when he's caught in a drag race because someone makes fun of the VW. Herbie blows the competition away and Jim falls in love with the car's speed, but Tennessee knows it has heart and names it Herbie.Soon Jim, Herbie and Tennessee are winning races and Jim's ego inflates while Thorndyke's temper grows since he too races and loses every time to Herbie. Thorndyke decides to sabotage the little car and when he succeeds, Jim turns his back on Herbie. Once Jim realizes HE hasn't being winning the races he tries to find Herbie who has since run off. Herbie gets impounded after an accident and Jim must sell him to a Chinese man who agrees to let Jim drive Herbie in a big race. If Jim wins, he gets to buy Herbie back for a buck. Needless to say, Thorndyke once again sabotages Herbie,but hey, this is Disney. Who do YOU think wins out at the end? I had to give this movie a 10 because it has so much going for it. Comedy, some drama, romance. We know very little about Jim Douglas except when Tennessee describes him as down on his luck, angry, and one who was prone to getting into trouble. Jones did an excellent job as the cocky, angry, egotistical driver who is knocked down a few pegs by his friends and a little car. The character mirrored Jones back then, who admits in his biography that he was a dirt bike racing nut prone to losing his temper quite a bit and having an affinity for women other than his wife. Michelle Lee is grand but we don't see much of her and Hackett plays the sincere bit amazingly well especially when he tells Jim that he was nothing without Herbie. For comedic relief David Tomlinson was terrific as was his assistant Havershaw(Joe Flynn of McHale's Navy fame).Yes there are some over the top, goofy and somewhat embarrassing sight gags and a few interesting moments(i.e. Carol thinking Jim has ulterior motives when Herbie brings them to a make-out point, i.e. when Herbie tries to kill itself, and when Jim finally admits to Carol that he's just a bum), but the film has heart, like Herbie. The film had three more sequels, a five part TV miniseries, a re-make in 1998(or so) and there's a new film coming out. Jones only did Love Bug, Monte Carlo(film 3), the miniseries and made a pathetic appearance in the 1998 film. In each one, Jones was still down on his luck but nothing like the sad figure he portrayed in Love Bug. Great classic film, filled with 60's nostalgia.

He lives with a Buddhist named Tennessee Steinmetz(Buddy Hackett)who finds a soul in everything.Jim soon looks for a new car and comes across a fancy dealership, only to be embarrassed by the owner Peter Thorndyke(David Tomlinson) who refuses Jim's $80 offer for a gorgeous race car. While in the showroom, a VW rolls in that was supposed to be scrapped. As Thorndyke berates the little car, Jim sticks up for it and soon the car thinks it has a friend and follows Jim home. To avoid being blamed for stealing the car, Jim agrees to buy it from Thorndyke but the car acts up. Jim is about to return it when he's caught in a drag race because someone makes fun of the VW. Herbie blows the competition away and Jim falls in love with the car's speed, but Tennessee knows it has heart and names it Herbie.Soon Jim, Herbie and Tennessee are winning races and Jim's ego inflates while Thorndyke's temper grows since he too races and loses every time to Herbie. Thorndyke decides to sabotage the little car and when he succeeds, Jim turns his back on Herbie. Once Jim realizes HE hasn't being winning the races he tries to find Herbie who has since run off. Herbie gets impounded after an accident and Jim must sell him to a Chinese man who agrees to let Jim drive Herbie in a big race. If Jim wins, he gets to buy Herbie back for a buck. Needless to say, Thorndyke once again sabotages Herbie,but hey, this is Disney. Who do YOU think wins out at the end? I had to give this movie a 10 because it has so much going for it. Comedy, some drama, romance. We know very little about Jim Douglas except when Tennessee describes him as down on his luck, angry, and one who was prone to getting into trouble. Jones did an excellent job as the cocky, angry, egotistical driver who is knocked down a few pegs by his friends and a little car. The character mirrored Jones back then, who admits in his biography that he was a dirt bike racing nut prone to losing his temper quite a bit and having an affinity for women other than his wife. Michelle Lee is grand but we don't see much of her and Hackett plays the sincere bit amazingly well especially when he tells Jim that he was nothing without Herbie. For comedic relief David Tomlinson was terrific as was his assistant Havershaw(Joe Flynn of McHale's Navy fame).Yes there are some over the top, goofy and somewhat embarrassing sight gags and a few interesting moments(i.e. Carol thinking Jim has ulterior motives when Herbie brings them to a make-out point, i.e. when Herbie tries to kill itself, and when Jim finally admits to Carol that he's just a bum), but the film has heart, like Herbie. The film had three more sequels, a five part TV miniseries, a re-make in 1998(or so) and there's a new film coming out. Jones only did Love Bug, Monte Carlo(film 3), the miniseries and made a pathetic appearance in the 1998 film. In each one, Jones was still down on his luck but nothing like the sad figure he portrayed in Love Bug. Great classic film, filled with 60's nostalgia.
