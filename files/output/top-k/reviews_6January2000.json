I hated this movie. That is, until I was able to see it again on video. Sometimes it takes a second viewing on video to really concentrate and pay attention to all the little details to really appreciate a movie. This is one of those movies.   While I still believe the ending was terrible, I thought the rest of the movie gets better every time I watch it. The opening scene is fantastic, and (POSSIBLE SPOILERS) I loved the idea of the killer sitting in the movie theater amongst hundreds of look-alike killers, with nobody knowing who the killer is or if he's even there. As Jada Pinkett finds out in a very clever scene, he is there.   I thought the best scene in the movie occurs when Randy, Dewey, and Gail are standing in the grass courtyard at the college, and the killer calls them on Gail's cell phone, playing games and watching them from a distance. I love the camerawork used while following Randy around as he searches for the killer. One shot in particular has the camera looking down on him from the sky, nobody else visible in the whole shot, which gives a feeling of me against the world, which Randy must have been feeling.

Sequels by definition alone are inferior films Scream was one of the few horror movies I could truly call great, and Scream 2 is likewise one of those rare sequels that at least approach the quality of the original (such as with Lethal Weapon 3 & 4 and Die Hard With a Vengeance).

Mickey at least was interesting, but his character was barely even developed and then, all of the sudden, here he is, your serial killer. I thought for sure going in that Stu somehow survived the first Scream and was coming back for part two, and when they introduced Debbie Salt as the killer, my heart took a dive.

Oliver Platt consistently plays great characters, and every time he adds a special flavor to each character. The dialogue, particularly that between Sherrif, Paleontologist, Ranger, and Professor is VERY well-written and fun to watch.That's the point of this film. FUN. I see people complaining about various things, but sometimes you just have to LIGHTEN UP and just ENJOY a movie! This was one of my favorite movies on 1999 - I thought the CGI was very good (sure as hell better than Anaconda) and while the plot is a rehash (someone mentioned Jaws... ever heard of THEM!, kids? Ever heard of the Beast from 20000 Fathoms? Spielberg didn't create the genre!) it's still passable and if you just enjoy the filck, it's well worth the rental fee.I compare this movie to another giant animal movie I love Tremors. Similar plot, the only differences are climate and a different blend of characters. Tremors is a FUN movie. Lake Placid is a FUN movie. You want serious, go rent Blair Witch or The Insider. You want something to watch with a few friends so you can have a good laugh, rent Lake Placid. I hope Sci Fi channel or Turner picks this up... I guarantee I'd watch Lake Placid every time it appeared on cable.

Ever heard of the Beast from 20000 Fathoms? Spielberg didn't create the genre!) it's still passable and if you just enjoy the filck, it's well worth the rental fee.I compare this movie to another giant animal movie I love Tremors. Similar plot, the only differences are climate and a different blend of characters. Tremors is a FUN movie. Lake Placid is a FUN movie. You want serious, go rent Blair Witch or The Insider. You want something to watch with a few friends so you can have a good laugh, rent Lake Placid. I hope Sci Fi channel or Turner picks this up...

The comedy is also great, it's been a long time since I've laughed this much during a film. The cinematography is great, the music is perfect for the film, the dialogue is brilliant.The acting is, of course, top notch. Brad Pitt is often overlooked as an actor because of the famous face and the famous body. This is a shame, because I think he's a really good actor although this is the first time I think he's great. Helena Bonham Carter is, surprisingly, perfectly cast. I could see no other actress portraying Marla Singer. Meat Loaf is good as well. I could go on and on about Edward Norton, but that will probably bore you so let's just say that, even though this isn't another Aaron Stampler- or Derek Vinyard mind-blowing performance, he is an acting genius and that his performance in Fight Club is brilliant.The production design is another thing that is worth mentioning as something really good. As everybody will probably realise there is a but here and it's coming now there is sadly a rather boring part in the film right before the brilliant last 10-15 minutes.

The Sixth Sense is unlike anything I've ever seen, and by far the best film I've seen in years.  Let me first say that I am no fan of horror films, and many classify this film as a horror picture.  It is not quite that.  One can get away with calling it a supernatural psychological thriller perhaps. To say that it is Horror however, is to put it in a genre generally known for its inferior product, and this film is anything but inferior. Unlike 1999's only other mentionable scare film, The Blair Witch Project, The Sixth Sense doesn't hide the terror from our sight.  We do see the ghosts that frighten Cole Sear so much.  And they are considerably scarier than the witch of the woods in Maryland.  But these frightening scenes are but one element in the overall success recipe of the film. Foremost I should mention Haley Joel Osment.  Only once before did a child actor really impress me.  I thought that Nick Stahl (in Man Without a Face) was outstanding.  But the depth and honesty of Haley's performance here I have yet to see the equal of.  He completely convinced me of his fear, and he invoked protective instincts in me I didn't know I had.  If there is any justice in Hollywood (yeah, right&#133;) he will AT LEAST be nominated for an Academy Award.  (If they could give it to Anna Paquin, they just might consider Haley).  In any instance, this little man has given a performance that many adult actors can rightly be very jealous of. The other performances are all outstanding too, and I'm sure now that no one could have betterred Bruce Willis in this role.Then, the direction and photography are far superior to anything I have seen in ages.  The film is dark.  Literally black sometimes.  There is hardly any sunlight anywhere, and the rooms are all pale and depressing.  This is Cole's world, and we are put right in there the entire time. Shyamalan also sneaks some very clever shots in the back door.  Look for a trace of Cole's sweat vanishing from the table, his reflection in a shiny doorknob etc.  These and many more find their way into the film, and every one of them fits perfectly where they are put.  In short - there is not a single frame out of place in this film.The human elements are also strikingly detailed.  Note the parents at the school concert whip out their camcorders when they see their kids on stage.  The cleverest scene of all, is between Willis and Haley.  They play a mind-reading game, and although one of them wins this battle of wills and wits, they both end up losing it in a way.These are just a few examples of the quality that this film boasts.  It is an extremely well made and unbelievably well thought out suspense film. It has been years since a film has given me physical, literal chills, and this film has done exactly that.  It managed to scare me -- something that a macho twentysomething man like me wouldn't like to admit.A final word  firstly, if you plan on seeing this film, read as little about it as you can.  Do not talk about it with friends who have seen it, because the less you know about it the better.  Let it unfold and take you over in it's own time. And secondly, go see it in the theater if you can.

The Sixth Sense is unlike anything I've ever seen, and by far the best film I've seen in years.  Let me first say that I am no fan of horror films, and many classify this film as a horror picture.  It is not quite that.  One can get away with calling it a supernatural psychological thriller perhaps. To say that it is Horror however, is to put it in a genre generally known for its inferior product, and this film is anything but inferior. Unlike 1999's only other mentionable scare film, The Blair Witch Project, The Sixth Sense doesn't hide the terror from our sight.  We do see the ghosts that frighten Cole Sear so much.  And they are considerably scarier than the witch of the woods in Maryland.  But these frightening scenes are but one element in the overall success recipe of the film. Foremost I should mention Haley Joel Osment.  Only once before did a child actor really impress me.  I thought that Nick Stahl (in Man Without a Face) was outstanding.  But the depth and honesty of Haley's performance here I have yet to see the equal of.  He completely convinced me of his fear, and he invoked protective instincts in me I didn't know I had.  If there is any justice in Hollywood (yeah, right&#133;) he will AT LEAST be nominated for an Academy Award.  (If they could give it to Anna Paquin, they just might consider Haley).  In any instance, this little man has given a performance that many adult actors can rightly be very jealous of. The other performances are all outstanding too, and I'm sure now that no one could have betterred Bruce Willis in this role.Then, the direction and photography are far superior to anything I have seen in ages.  The film is dark.  Literally black sometimes.  There is hardly any sunlight anywhere, and the rooms are all pale and depressing.  This is Cole's world, and we are put right in there the entire time. Shyamalan also sneaks some very clever shots in the back door.  Look for a trace of Cole's sweat vanishing from the table, his reflection in a shiny doorknob etc.  These and many more find their way into the film, and every one of them fits perfectly where they are put.  In short - there is not a single frame out of place in this film.The human elements are also strikingly detailed.  Note the parents at the school concert whip out their camcorders when they see their kids on stage.  The cleverest scene of all, is between Willis and Haley.  They play a mind-reading game, and although one of them wins this battle of wills and wits, they both end up losing it in a way.These are just a few examples of the quality that this film boasts.  It is an extremely well made and unbelievably well thought out suspense film. It has been years since a film has given me physical, literal chills, and this film has done exactly that.  It managed to scare me -- something that a macho twentysomething man like me wouldn't like to admit.A final word  firstly, if you plan on seeing this film, read as little about it as you can.  Do not talk about it with friends who have seen it, because the less you know about it the better.  Let it unfold and take you over in it's own time. And secondly, go see it in the theater if you can.

It makes what was horrific, strange, and ironically exciting and mysterious about the Vietnam War into this mad tale of obsession, death, loss, and the dark side of humanity. While the stories behind the production of the film made it notorious and rather risky back in 1979, it works on its own terms and represents not just Coppola's genius but others in the Zoetrope team as well. It also paints a sometimes lurid, ultra-violent, bleak and curious view of what war does to people, both in the lower ranks, the big-guns, and those who go too far up the river.Many have also been perplexed by Marlon Brando's performance in the film, but it's actually one of his very best turns on screen, albeit improvised and close to running off the rails. His few moments on screen (even in the somewhat unnecessary scene plopped into the Redux version) there's enough conviction in what he's saying- and what perhaps isn't said- that makes the trip down the river worthwhile on an intellectual and poetic level. And making up the bulk of the film are delirious turns by Robert Duvall (a Oscar nominated turn he should've won), Martin Sheen as the Captain with almost too much to ponder in an ever increasing state of everything but him being insane; character actors like Sam Bottoms, Frederic Forrest and 14 year-old Laurence Fishburne have some of the best work they've ever done. And it goes without saying that Dennis Hopper comes close to stealing any scene he's in, for better or worse, with the most to say in rambling, yet coherent words.Every time I watch this film (and mostly the original version which is what first drew me in completely as opposed to the very good if muddled Redux version) I am astounded with how operatic everything is, and how the variations on the madness and chaos of Vietnam is put together. Of course one can give adulation to Coppola for this as he completed it without totally going off the deep end or possibly dying, and his talents are pulled to their richest peaks here as a storyteller and director of actors. But it can't be said enough how much I can't get enough of Vittorio Storaro's cinematography, which has in part come close to perfect for this kind of epic film. The music is perfectly eerie and insidious, with the Doors song used for one of my favorite iconic scenes in the movies (both of them). Walter Murch's editing- which apparently was what saved the film from being a four-hour disaster- makes the action move when it needs to and for individual shots to get their due. And even the production design is remarkable and, to the extent it goes to, original in its partial translation of both Conrad's fiction and the unfortunate realities of life on the river.If you haven't seen it yet, in short, get off your ass and get a copy; it might cause a kind of shell-shock for a viewer after first taking it all in, but it has some of the purest, most rewarding bits of cinema ever to come out of that all-too-brief American new-wave of the 1970's.
