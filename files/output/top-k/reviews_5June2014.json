Harry Goldfarb (Jared Leto) is a drug fiend who keeps pawning off his mother (Ellen Burstyn)'s TV. He and his druggie friend Tyrone C. Love (Marlon Wayans) wants to start selling drugs on their own.

Marion Silver (Jennifer Connelly) is Harry's girlfriend and she's pulled into his scheme.It's director Darren Aronofsky's second full length feature, and it shows that he has an unique vision. These are compelling characters in unforgettable stories. Ellen Burstyn is completely immersed into her role. Their slow descent is hard to take and hard to take my eyes off of. The use of quick cuts, fast forwards, and close ups all accentuate the disturbing nature of drugs. The use of SnorriCam which attached to the actors' bodies is probably the most memorable. It's all very disturbing. ","genre":null},{"date":"5 June 2014","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Four lives are disintegrating.

It was 6 years between Bond movies, the longest break ever, and by far. Gone is Timothy Dalton who brought a real and flawed and emotional James Bond to the screen, a darker Bond. In is Roger Moore style action in the form of one Mr. Steele, Remington Steele... errr, I mean Pierce Brosnan. The stunts are great, most of them, but comic, too, such as freefalling to the side of a nosediving airplane. Give me a break! But we do have a return to action and that's a wonderful thing for the thrill seeking Bond viewer. Unfortunately, we have lame music and a lame opening Gun Barrel sequence. The main song, written by Bono and The Edge, is great, but where's the Bond Theme throughout the film? Yes, music can help make a movie and here it helps break it. Ugh. Terrible! But overall I am impressed. Brosnan is going to take some time to get used to. He's the third Bond in four films but he might do. We shall see! Oh, and interestingly to me, this is the first James Bond film (chronologically) that I never previously saw. For the life of me, I cannot remember seeing any of it ever so this was the first time. I know I've seen clips and I have seen other Brosnan 007 movies, but never this one. In any case, it's not amazing but still great and so very welcomed. Will definitely watch again one day!7.5 \/ 10 stars--Zoooma, a Kat Pirate Screener ","genre":null},{"date":"5 June 2014","score":"","review":" A 007 makeover.
