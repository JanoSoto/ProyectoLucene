I didn't find it, but I did find Mark Bowden's Philadephia Inquirer articles on it, and I was hooked. I ordered the book.I don't know if I suffered from reading the book three times in the last six months had anything to do with it, or whether all the great reviews I've read had built up my expectations...I honestly TRIED to go into the theater with an open mind. I'm trying to see how great this movie was...I'm trying to look at it as if I'd never read the book. I'm actually thinking of seeing it again to see if I like it better.The truth is, I kept waiting to feel MASSIVE anxiety watching this movie, and I never did. Maybe I have too vivid an imagination. Maybe I've played way too much Counter-Strike. Maybe my home theater and my DTS copy of Saving Private Ryan is just too good, and I've become de-sensitized to movie depictions of war.God, I really wanted this movie to be special. I didn't think it was.--Not to take anything away from our men and women in uniform...those people have my utmost respect and appreciation for defending us.--and not to take anything away from Ridley Scott.  I STILL think Alien is the scariest movie ever made, and I was one of the seven people that LOVED Legend. This is the guy who gave birth to Blade Runner.But man, I have to admit I was let down by Black Hawk Down on a number of levels.The setup was nice. Great music, great shots...and when the guys take off initially to Stevie Ray Vaughn's rendition of Voodoo Chile (slight return), I was GEKED.But these guys that say it's like a two hour version of the first twenty minutes of SPR are exaggerating, imho. In SPR, I FELT the Americans being HAMMERED on that beach. I've read a couple of things some of the rangers who've seen the movie (and gave positive reviews to)have written about it, and they claim that the movie only has about 1\/10th of the bullets flying that the actual battle had. The book made it seem like it was just withering walls of lead and rpgs--just a horizontal HAILSTORM of bullets so thick you could actually SEE them. It depicted it as ABSOLUTELY merciless and relentless.I also had a problem with the way the Somalis were stylized. Not that I know any better because I wasn't there, but these guys all dressed in black, with aviator shades and bandoliers--seemed to me like a half-assed way of putting a face on the enemy. All the pictures I've seen of these guys show them as just skinny dudes in second-hand clothes with guns. No bandoliers, no swagger, just bony khat junkies with weapons that looked way too big for them. Hey, maybe I'm wrong.Speaking of aviator shades, wtf was up with Sam Shepard and his? On again, off again. Was this the Bruckheimer influence? That seemed a little more Hollywood than Fort Benning.  I have a world of respect and admiration for Shepard as both an actor and playwright, but General Garrison didn't sound like the kind of guy who wore shades INDOORS.I have to admit, this was the first time I've heard a Vulcan cannon spool up in a film--truly a powerful sound. --but every time they showed the effects of it, it was just squibs under some extras' shirts. I was under the impression that this thing literally SHREDS people. My point is, it seemed unrealistic and anti-climactic.Don't get me wrong--I'm not disappointed because I didn't get to see people get shredded. It's just that if you're going to portray war accurately, I think you should portray war accurately.And I have to mention the rpgs.  In the film, a Somali militiaman fires the rpg that takes out Cliff Wolcott's helo ON THE RUN WITH A GUY BEHIND HIM. From what I've read, the Somalis had to rig special deflectors on the back of their launch tubes to fire upwards because the backblast could seriously injure, if not kill you. They also had to build pits to divert the backblast, so they fired upward from stationary, pre-determined positions. Does having the Somali fire the rpg on the run justify poetic license just enough to ignore reality?When the troops received the go-codeword for the mission, Irene, in reality, they were already aboard the helos. They got on them nearly every day, and were usually ordered to stand down.  What a great opportunity to show the heat and boredom of the same old daily grind, only to have the rangers shocked out of their false sense of security by an authentic go-code. What a perfect way to start their disorientation--with the mission. Instead, we got a hundred guys running out to the helicopters, guns in the ready position. Sounds like Bruckheimer. If Michael Bay had been directing, they would have swaggered toward the camera in slow motion, shoulder to shoulder, in a glorious telephoto shot, waves of heat rising from the asphalt ala Armageddon or Bad Boys.Then there was Private Blackburn's fall from the helicopter. Why switch from Sgt. Eversmann's point of view to the objective when it would be much more shocking and disorienting stay with his point of view, have him rope in and just FIND Blackburn lying there in the cloud of dust, as he did in the book? Why take poetic license to JUSTIFY Blackburn falling off the rope with the Blackhawk dodging (DODGING?) an rpg fired from forty feet away? Does it make it more dramatic? Does it make it more dramatic enough to change the facts?No one can stylize things the way Ridley Scott does. But I've never seen a war movie that was LIT so well, or suffering soldiers look so cool. I actually was distracted from the story by it...wow, cool green glow on Eric Bana. It looked good, but I never got the feeling that the form, the IMAGES were used to express the relentless anxiety these soldiers must have felt, alone, surrounded, teetering on the edge of despair and desperation. It seems to me that it was usually expressed through dialogue and\/or by scene.I guess all in all, I expected the thing just to HAMMER me from the git-go, to ratchet up in intensity, and to stay there for a while. I only got bits and spurts of fear here and there, interspersed with exposition.  It was start\/stop all the way. ENOUGH WITH THE EXPOSITION! I think they took too many moments to explain EVERYTHING that was going on to the audience (I'm guessing this is another fine example of Bruckheimer's continuing contempt for the intellect of the masses), and didn't just make something seamlessly horrific and unrelenting, the way it was for the soldiers. The film did not need the Atta kidnapping sequence; it was a redundant attempt to justify to the audience the American presence in Somalia--as if we needed one after the opening scene of starving and dead Somalis. We could have spent less time in the command center--less exposition, shorter, tighter bits of dialogue with General Garrison outwardly stoic and inwardly on edge. Why have any exposition at all other than saying at the top of the film, This Story is True, and then depicting the facts in all of their undeniable horror?The story could easily have been told, and told more honestly imho, without losing any truth in the portrayal of the events of 10\/3\/93, if it had focused constantly on the men under SAVAGELY intense fire.Where were the women and children used as human shields? Why didn't they spend more time on the truck driver with the unexploded rpg lodged in his torso--he was STILL ALIVE when that happened--what a great opportunity to express the DIRE PERIL and unique absurdity of their situation. Instead, it was treated as a just another brief novelty of war.  Where was the wounded soldier who was blown out of his Humvee by an rpg and then RUN OVER by the following truck? Where was the ox that was shredded by gunfire? Where was the guy riding the cow with the AK? Where was the soldier hiding behind the tiny piece of pipe protruding from the road while his buddies burst out laughing? Where were the two Somalis with the machine gun in the middle of the road who WOULD NOT DIE? Where were the flashbang grenades? Where was the indestructible old Somali man with the big white afro? Nearly all of the Humvees and trucks had flat tires and were nearly in pieces when they returned to the airbase, not just a few bullet holes.  Dominic Pila, god rest his soul, the sergeant who did the impression of Captain Steele and got a bullet in the neck while operating the .50 cal in the lead Humvee, in reality, was shot in the face, and the entire back of his head was blown off. All of these events serve to demonstrate the horror AND the absurdity of war on their own merit, AND THEY ACTUALLY HAPPENED.  The point isn't that all of these events should have been in the film; the point is that there were a lot of neglected and missed opportunities to take the audience deeper into the living hell in which these men were stranded.And what was with the huge, poetic, sum-it-all up but momentarily throw realism to the wind, cast of a thousand Somalis standing atop a burning hill doing nothing while the American soldiers run away shot? This is a story that doesn't NEED editorializing, that doesn't NEED poetry.I truly, honestly wish I could have seen it the way most of the people who are raving about it did. I really wanted to see it that way. I was looking forward to seeing it that way. I'm not disappointed because I have some twisted bloodlust--I just believe that if you're going to express the horror of war--as Bowden did in his book--that you don't hold back. These guys fought and died for all of us. I just think they are due having their story told as graphically and as gut-wrenchingly and as honestly as possible. Despite the fact that 19 US soldiers died and over 70 were wounded in action, the mission was completed successfully; it was in fact, a victory. Mentioning that might have been a better cap to this film than the thin irony that Aidid died the day before Garrison retired.The soldiers had it bad in the movie. They had it A LOT WORSE in the book.I've just read this review, and I think I may sound a bit like those guys who quibbled over details about the adaptation of The Lord of the Rings. I hope I'm wrong. None of the above changes were made to condense time. And Black Hawk Down was about REAL people, who suffered unimaginably REAL events.Just my two cents.

All of these events serve to demonstrate the horror AND the absurdity of war on their own merit, AND THEY ACTUALLY HAPPENED.  The point isn't that all of these events should have been in the film; the point is that there were a lot of neglected and missed opportunities to take the audience deeper into the living hell in which these men were stranded.And what was with the huge, poetic, sum-it-all up but momentarily throw realism to the wind, cast of a thousand Somalis standing atop a burning hill doing nothing while the American soldiers run away shot? This is a story that doesn't NEED editorializing, that doesn't NEED poetry.I truly, honestly wish I could have seen it the way most of the people who are raving about it did. I really wanted to see it that way. I was looking forward to seeing it that way. I'm not disappointed because I have some twisted bloodlust--I just believe that if you're going to express the horror of war--as Bowden did in his book--that you don't hold back. These guys fought and died for all of us. I just think they are due having their story told as graphically and as gut-wrenchingly and as honestly as possible. Despite the fact that 19 US soldiers died and over 70 were wounded in action, the mission was completed successfully; it was in fact, a victory. Mentioning that might have been a better cap to this film than the thin irony that Aidid died the day before Garrison retired.The soldiers had it bad in the movie. They had it A LOT WORSE in the book.I've just read this review, and I think I may sound a bit like those guys who quibbled over details about the adaptation of The Lord of the Rings. I hope I'm wrong. None of the above changes were made to condense time. And Black Hawk Down was about REAL people, who suffered unimaginably REAL events.Just my two cents.

Indeed as part of the experience we might be entitled to our share of the takings. Sadly it seems the project made off with our cut.The result is a picture that does not give the actors (a draw to watch this film in the first place) enough scope to push their craft. There are too many wasted moments of dull editing and sequencing, with little to distract the audience (which doesn't say much about the dialogue). Indeed if the tone and pace of the film is played out in the low key, understated fashion we find here, then it needs to be anchored in interesting mis-en-scene, screenplay and ultimately larger focus.The mis-en-scene is unimaginative and neither suggests character's emotion or motivation as screen composition helps to. Scenery and locale say little save that we know the picture is going to be reserved due to the style of Jazz on offer. Color and shadow (we find De Niro in the dark so much that even Brando complains) only suggest secrecy and hidden agendas but do little to portray fatalism or mood. The framing is not in sync to suggest either emotional distance or are there sufficient close ups which would have allowed for more studied characterization. Both suggestions I feel would have allowed for more gravitas which would have also kept in line with the studied pace of the film.The screenplay delivers in a few scenes but generally the dialogue isn't engaging or emotionally binding enough to connect the viewer to the coolness on screen. There are some good light moments between De Niro and Basset and some comical lines given to Norton, which although keeping with the naturalistic dialogue was a nice contrast from the talk given to the heist itself, which was bland on the whole (see THE KILLING). Not that I was expecting to find cartoonish gangster language in a mature picture but the set pieces seemed stilted. Just going through the motions to fill space. It might have been better if there was less talk with dialogue kept to a minimum and totally spared down. A picture designed for physical acting, which along with my other suggestions may have suited this subdued heist film well.However where this film fails to engage the most is in its wider scope as a metaphor about the art of acting (see OCEAN'S 11). Ultimately the film concerns actors and the act of putting a film together. The 'item', the 'score' is the film itself. With the players squarely in the crosshairs, what should be a celebration of the talents of two of the most accomplished actors of the screen, and one of the most promising of the new stock never materializes. Taken in context of a film about getting a job done, or as Norton states to be 'treated with respect and as a professional' (ultimately the ambition of any actor), this leaves the whole project wanting.

His attitude added well to the naturalistic feel, which was also a welcome release in a film of studied content.There could have been more time given to the relationship of De Niro and Basset. It would have allowed for the audience to associate closer with the picture and the core theme of De Niro wishing to leave his life of crime and find fulfillment in a healthy loving and trusting relationship.

Further additions that may have benefited the picture could have expanded the theme of duality between De Niro and Norton (see HEAT).

After reading that Ebert gave it 4-stars, I was more that psyched to see it.My complaints flat characters, lame mystery, lack of any humor.The first hour of the film was basically Altman's chance to introduce the characters -- I felt that this could have been done in 10 minutes. The characters were flat and archetypical. There was no need to see an hour of the characters, when their personality was easily known by the first moment they were seen on screen.The movie was not funny.

The messages in his films often suggest that moral boundaries are crossed more often than not, and everyone eventually has to face the skeletons in their closets. In his latest film, The Shipping News, Hallstrom continues in this tradition exceptionally well. The problem is, the film is based on the Pulitzer-prize winning novel of the same name by E. Annie Proulx, and films often pale in comparison to their literary counterparts. This film is no exception.                                   The movie stars Kevin Spacey, as the                                    hapless Mr. Quoyle, a simpleton who                                    works as an ink setter for a newspaper.                                    He fumbles into a marriage in name only,                                    and has a child named Bunny. His wife dies about ten years later, after having sold their                                    daughter to a black market adoption agency and trying to escape with a barfly she                                    recently met. It's when Quoyle's father dies that his life takes a change. It turns out his                                    father had a stepsister named Agnis (Judi Dench), who shows up one day to claim his                                    ashes, and Quoyle decides to follow her back to Newfoundland, with daughter Bunny in                                    tow. There, the three begin a new life in the long-abandoned house his father and Agnis                                    grew up in, and where Quoyle slowly learns of his ugly family secrets of murder, incest                                    and rape. Through a complex series of events and relationships, Quoyle evolves a new                                    sense of reconciliation and purpose in life As a churning backdrop of the cold and desolate seascape of Canada's Newfoundland, the movie evokes the same emotions from its characters and from the audience. Mood is the major strength of the film, and is done so effectively that it almost overshadows its weaker points. All the performances are top-notch, the story is compelling, and the messages are cognizant of human emotion. So, what's wrong? It's Quoyle himself. This isn't really Kevin Spacey's fault; there's no question that his performance is one of his best, and this grade-A film owes its success to the depth and warmth he portrays. No, it's that there is still something not quite right about the character that irked me. To understand that, we have to go to the source the book itself.                                   I hesitate to do this so reactively, since                                    literary works and movies are inherently                                    different narrative forms, and comparing                                    one with the other is, in my opinion, like                                    comparing apples and oranges. Movies, by their nature, are forced to focus on a smaller                                    set of issues than a book, but, if done well, they can be extraordinarily moving on the                                    same storyline. The challenge for a filmmaker is to choose which parts of the book to                                    adapt and express well. In the case of The Shipping News, the main thrust of the book                                    is Quoyle. Ms. Proulx's characterization of him is that of a physically grotesque and                                    freakish oaf, and it is partially this persona that makes the impact of the things that                                    happen to him have the profound effect that is felt from the book. By contrast, Spacey's                                    portrayal of Quoyle is too normal and likeable, both in his personality and his physical                                    presence to have the kinds of quirks and inconsistently positive\/negative behaviors that                                    he's supposed to have.There are other differences in depictions between the film and the novel, but I can more easily forgive them as creative interpretations by two equally gifted story-tellers and mediums. That Hallstrom beautifies scenics or other features of the story that the novel is less sentimental about is an example of this. Again, the book was much better, but the movie is hardly an unmoving experience. It's fantastic. But not acknowledging the main thrust of the main character is where I take exception. I understand that it's nearly impossible to compress an incredible novel into a two hour movie, so I'm more forgiving than others may be. In fact, as a film, I found The Shipping News to be one of the best I've seen in ages. If you don't read the book, you may even agree.

If I see a movie in the theater more than once, you know I like it...especially at $8. a ticket. I've seen LOTR 5x!!For those who say there wasn't any feeling...I don't see where they get that. When Gandalf Fell... You felt it, and saw it on the faces of all the characters. When Boromir died, it was FAR more touching and sad than in the book. The look on Sam's face at the end after being pulled in the boat when he tells Frodo that he will not break the promise he made was very moving. the fear Frodo had looked real. I think the feeling was very well illustrated. Even better than in the book.To me, I love the book mind you, but I like the movie better because Tolkien was a real stickler for detail, but a lot of the emotion was lost in some places to me because he spent so much time on the detail of surroundings rather than the detail of the feelings. The movie paid less attention to detail since you could see it instead of having it described to you, so they were able to portray it via great acting.All of the actors were fantastic. I was extremely worried about Elijah Wood, and Liv Tyler in all honesty. And my favorite character ever, Legolas...(I've liked him and Gimli since the cartoon before I was old enough to read, and more after I read the book), was being played by an actor I've never heard of, because he was an unknown! Just an extra with one small line in a movie I never saw. (I'm speaking of Orlando Bloom)But all of my worries were dashed when I saw them all in character. Elijah was the best choice for Frodo. Liv did a great job as Arwen, and I feel people over-reacted to her replacing the character of Glorfindel because I feel it worked nicely. Orlando Bloom is a handsome and wonderful actor! The entire cast did far beyond what I expected from them, and I was very pleased. (And I'm very hard to please. If I go in thinking I'm going to find flaws with you, I will even if you do a great job.) but with this movie and these actors, it was impossible. Viggo (Aragorn) Billy and Dominic (Pippin and Merry) Sir Ian (Gandalf) the Seans (Boromir and Sam) The ENTIRE cast were just wonderful! Better than I expected!I do not think this movie was over-hyped. it was just as good as they said it would be. And in fact I went in not expecting it, and was proved wrong. (Remember, any time you expect too much, you'll be let down...IE Titanic. I listened to the major hype and I hated that movie.) But to me this movie won't let you down. Unless you're just against sitting back and enjoying the movie. Its action packed and has feeling. And its not just for tolkien fans.BTW. for those who thought the ending sucked...um....that is how the the first book ends. Yes first book. It surprises me to see how many people don't realize there are two more movies!!

After watching Stigmata I made the comment that was a weird movie. My reasons for saying that was not because it contained anything that I previously mentioned, but because this movie barely made any sense and was basically a flop. It was a shame too because there was so much potential for this one but it all flew out the window. To my knowledge, movies that had anything regarding the afflictions of stigmata are very scarce, so there was the potential to make an excellent film. But in my opinion, this film was put into the wrong hands and never turned out as good as it could and should have been.For starters, this film had some the absolute worst plot holes I have ever seen in any movie. The fact that a self-declared atheist has received stigmata is never explored or defined and that just adds a sense of confusion rather than mystery. At least some films that pull off that formula have some remote, indirect sense of an explanation but leaves the viewer to put together a puzzle of clues and whatnot and draw their own conclusion such as The Blair Witch Project so brilliantly did. But the fact that an atheist just all of a sudden receives stigmata (and becomes possessed) just because her mother gave her the rosary of a dead priest just doesn't cut it. Furthermore, the Catholic Church is horribly portrayed as a bunch of corrupt priests that attempt cover-ups or even murder to keep a secret.To add to the problem, there were some big problems in the casting. There are basically only three characters that have a major part in this. Nia Long who plays Frankie's best friend does a good job with her role but just suddenly disappears half-way through the film and never returns. The same holds true for Frankie's boyfriend where the only part he's in is having sex with Frankie in the opening montage. That leaves us with another problem now that I mention montage. In the opening scene, little snippets of biblical pictures are cut into the film and according to the director's commentary on the DVD are significant because those are the images that linger in the back of Frankie's head. This same situation holds true each time Frankie receives a stigmata wound. Supposedly whenever this happens, Frankie receives information in some supernatural manner as to what's happening to her. But the thing is, no one would understand the deep meaning to the plot unless the viewer listens to the director's commentary on the DVD, otherwise, such material is confusing and makes no sense. Also in the film as Frankie becomes more deeply possessed, there are little scenery clues that she is changing more and more. Like when she and Father Kiernan are in her apartment, you can see in the background that her bathroom wall is painted red when it was originally another color but Frankie never mentions that she actually painted the wall (that was another piece of info. from the DVD commentary). So unless anyone listens to this infamous commentary, moments like the one mentioned would most likely be regarded as continuity rather than a clue dropped along in the plot.The only reason I give Stigmata a 4 out of 10 was because it was visually fun to watch. It has an MTV-esquire atmosphere (with a great techno-ish soundtrack) and works quite well (it is usually used when Frankie is attacked) and adds a great creepiness factor. Also, (yes, another snippet from the commentary) the director brilliantly plays with colors on the screen to make something pop out which is very effective. For example, when Frankie is first taken to the hospital after the stigmata wounds on her wrists, the main colors in the ER are blue and green which makes Frankie's spurting blood flow stand out and that formula works quite well. Also, the performances by Patricia Arquette and Gabriel Byrne are exceptional.

One of Paul Verhoeven's dream projects is to do a film on the topic of Jesus.  The 4th Man(1984) also in certain moments was obsessed with the Jesus allegory presented in RoboCop(1987). Story makes many references to Jesus and Franenstein tales.After building up an impressive resume as an European cult film director, Paul Verhoeven in the mid 1980s decided to make it a try at Hollywood. RoboCop(1987) was his first and best Hollywood feature.  When he made this, Paul Verhoeven showed some promise as a filmmaker who could take chances with taboo subject matters in Hollywood.  American films since RoboCop(1987) have been dissapointments especially Starship Troopers(1997) and Hollow Man(2000).  One exception of a good Hollywood film besides RoboCop(1987) is Total Recall(1990).  It always saddens me when excellent foreign filmmakers(for most part) who come to Hollywood end up making mediocre films.RoboCop(1987) might have not been possible without box office success of The Terminator(1984).  Like most things in cinema one form of movie always gives way to another.  An interesting tidbit on RoboCop is that Arnold Schwarzenegger was considered as a canidate for main role.  Due to the fact that Arnold was too big to fit into the RoboCop suit, the filmmakers went for Peter Wellar instead.  RoboCop(1987) and The Terminator(1984) are two of the most influential SCIFI films of the 1980s.  Look of the latter film is apparent in set designs of former.Violence in feature is shown with a dark humor approach.  There are a few instants when violence enters the realm of comic books with over the top presentation.  Disturbingly humorous is what I call the death of Kenny moment.  Violent scenes are flamboyantly filmed by Paul Verhoeven. Some of the gore scenes are in the style of Lone Wolf and Cub, and Lucio Fulci. Daring way of showing violence that many in today's Hollywood would never do.A fun part in watching it is the cold blooded villainous performance of Kurtwood Smith.  He plays his character with ability to act brutish and look intellectual at same time.  You never would think just by looking at Clarence Boddicker with his bookish looks that he is a foul mouth murderer. Its funny to know that vicious bad guys are usually played by nice guys. Michael Ironside plays the same sort of character in Total Recall(1990). Editing of RoboCop(1987) is fantastic especially during the Mediabreak moments.Tangled in the satiric and violent web is a tragic tale of rediscovery. Focuses on a man who loses all that is precious to him including his human ways.  The robotized Murphy is in essence in the same path as the replicants of Blade Runner(1982).  Deals with similar ideas about identity and memory as Total Recall(1990).  Identity and what it means to a person is the most important theme of RoboCop(1987).  The main protagonist does at least get a portion of his past life which seemed lost to him.Mediabreak sequences are interludes to the main action of the plot. Mediabreak sequences and the commercials that follow them provide a humorous truth about American culture.  The funniest commercial presented in the parody of the Battleship boardgame.  Nancy Allen is excellent in what I think is her best role.  Ronny Cox is menacing as the ruthless executive, Dick Jones.  Miguel Ferrer does well in the role of the ambitious and arrogant Bob Morton.Aspect of RoboCop that story zeros in on is the dual nature of main character once he's transformed into RoboCop.  Its at the moment of a dream that RoboCop begins to wonder about who he is.  Peter Weller brings a lot of depth into the role to make Alex Murphy a tragic hero.  Alex Murphy's death is shocking because of the way he's killed.  As gruesome and over the top as any death scene in a Lucio Fulci film from the early 1980s.  Its the kind of death scene one usually reserves for the end of a film.Works as a satire on the attitude and excess of the 1980s.  Yuppie culture in RoboCop(1987) is shown as arrogant and obnoxious.  1980s culture has never been protrayed with the humorous edge lacking in most films about 1980s culture with exception of Heathers(1989).  Rob Bottin provides some gruesome but impressive makeup effects for RoboCop.  Ranks among Bottin's best work as makeup effects man alongside The Howling(1980), and The Thing(1982).  Rob Bottin's effects for Murphy's bloody demise rivals anything by Tom Savini or Gianetto De Rossi.A subtle moment is when Murphy\/RoboCop shoots at bottles of baby food wi help of his partner for aim.  It represents the fact that RoboCop can never have children or have an intimate relationship with Lewis.  A couple of action scenes are in the fashion of Hong Kong Heroic Bloodshed pics. RoboCop(1987) is made up of memorable set pieces which have their own impressive signature.  Peter Weller's performance as a robot who regains his human face preemits Arnold Schwarzenegger's development of human traits in Terminator 2Judgement Day(1991).  One of the ten great SCIFI films made during the 1980s.

Focuses on a man who loses all that is precious to him including his human ways.  The robotized Murphy is in essence in the same path as the replicants of Blade Runner(1982).  Deals with similar ideas about identity and memory as Total Recall(1990).  Identity and what it means to a person is the most important theme of RoboCop(1987).  The main protagonist does at least get a portion of his past life which seemed lost to him.Mediabreak sequences are interludes to the main action of the plot. Mediabreak sequences and the commercials that follow them provide a humorous truth about American culture.  The funniest commercial presented in the parody of the Battleship boardgame.  Nancy Allen is excellent in what I think is her best role.  Ronny Cox is menacing as the ruthless executive, Dick Jones.  Miguel Ferrer does well in the role of the ambitious and arrogant Bob Morton.Aspect of RoboCop that story zeros in on is the dual nature of main character once he's transformed into RoboCop.  Its at the moment of a dream that RoboCop begins to wonder about who he is.  Peter Weller brings a lot of depth into the role to make Alex Murphy a tragic hero.  Alex Murphy's death is shocking because of the way he's killed.  As gruesome and over the top as any death scene in a Lucio Fulci film from the early 1980s.  Its the kind of death scene one usually reserves for the end of a film.Works as a satire on the attitude and excess of the 1980s.  Yuppie culture in RoboCop(1987) is shown as arrogant and obnoxious.  1980s culture has never been protrayed with the humorous edge lacking in most films about 1980s culture with exception of Heathers(1989).  Rob Bottin provides some gruesome but impressive makeup effects for RoboCop.  Ranks among Bottin's best work as makeup effects man alongside The Howling(1980), and The Thing(1982).  Rob Bottin's effects for Murphy's bloody demise rivals anything by Tom Savini or Gianetto De Rossi.A subtle moment is when Murphy\/RoboCop shoots at bottles of baby food wi help of his partner for aim.  It represents the fact that RoboCop can never have children or have an intimate relationship with Lewis.  A couple of action scenes are in the fashion of Hong Kong Heroic Bloodshed pics. RoboCop(1987) is made up of memorable set pieces which have their own impressive signature.  Peter Weller's performance as a robot who regains his human face preemits Arnold Schwarzenegger's development of human traits in Terminator 2Judgement Day(1991).  One of the ten great SCIFI films made during the 1980s. ","genre":"Action, Crime, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"19 January 2002","score":"","review":"    ***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** RoboCop(1987) on one level is an allegory on the death and rebirth of Jesus Christ.  Its a topic that has been a fascination for artists almost more than anything else.  Art's interest in the death and rebirth of Jesus is a continuous one.  One of Paul Verhoeven's dream projects is to do a film on the topic of Jesus.  The 4th Man(1984) also in certain moments was obsessed with the Jesus allegory presented in RoboCop(1987). Story makes many references to Jesus and Franenstein tales.After building up an impressive resume as an European cult film director, Paul Verhoeven in the mid 1980s decided to make it a try at Hollywood. RoboCop(1987) was his first and best Hollywood feature.  When he made this, Paul Verhoeven showed some promise as a filmmaker who could take chances with taboo subject matters in Hollywood.  American films since RoboCop(1987) have been dissapointments especially Starship Troopers(1997) and Hollow Man(2000).  One exception of a good Hollywood film besides RoboCop(1987) is Total Recall(1990).  It always saddens me when excellent foreign filmmakers(for most part) who come to Hollywood end up making mediocre films.RoboCop(1987) might have not been possible without box office success of The Terminator(1984).  Like most things in cinema one form of movie always gives way to another.  An interesting tidbit on RoboCop is that Arnold Schwarzenegger was considered as a canidate for main role.  Due to the fact that Arnold was too big to fit into the RoboCop suit, the filmmakers went for Peter Wellar instead.  RoboCop(1987) and The Terminator(1984) are two of the most influential SCIFI films of the 1980s.  Look of the latter film is apparent in set designs of former.Violence in feature is shown with a dark humor approach.  There are a few instants when violence enters the realm of comic books with over the top presentation.  Disturbingly humorous is what I call the death of Kenny moment.  Violent scenes are flamboyantly filmed by Paul Verhoeven. Some of the gore scenes are in the style of Lone Wolf and Cub, and Lucio Fulci. Daring way of showing violence that many in today's Hollywood would never do.A fun part in watching it is the cold blooded villainous performance of Kurtwood Smith.  He plays his character with ability to act brutish and look intellectual at same time.  You never would think just by looking at Clarence Boddicker with his bookish looks that he is a foul mouth murderer. Its funny to know that vicious bad guys are usually played by nice guys.

This is an                  understatement. In the midst of reality-based entertainment, this film pushes the envelope the furthest so far, totally immersing you in a war environment like no other experience before. Director Ridley Scott re-creates a fierce 15-hour battle between besieged U.S. troops and Somali fighters on the streets of Mogadishu in 1993, in which 18 Americans were killed and 73 injured, along with thousands of Somali militia. Scott's exceptional visual sense is expressed to perfection, putting you directly in the center of action, from beginning to end, as if you were one of the soldiers themselves. But, don't think it's just another testosterone-laden war film. It's not. It is an intelligent and ambitious effort to accurately portray the soldiers' experiences of that fateful day.                                    The plot is actually rather simple. American                                    servicemen were to capture the warlord, Mohammed                                    Farah Aidid, in a mission that was to take less than one                                    hour. Things went awry from the beginning when a                                    soldier falls to the ground from a helicopter. The                                    dominoes start to fall as his comrades attempt to                                    rescue him, and they start getting picked off by                                    snipers. The movie is all about what these soldiers                                    went through, and how they survived, or how they died.                                    And herein lies the dilemma. The cost of                                    portraying reality so intensely and                                    dramatically in two hours means that                                    anything that could soften this experience                                    has to be left out. In this case, any sort of character development, plot, or historical context that may suggest political commentary one way or the other have all been swept aside. Also note that the film portrays experiences, not necessarily everything that happens. The political objectives of their mission are, as you might expect from a soldier's point of view, all besides the point. What's more, certain events, like the dragging of two American soldiers through the streets - an event that was televised on CNN that moved American public opinion so strongly - are also left out of the film. It isn't entirely clear what the Scott's intent was for the film, since what I saw seems to differ from what he said he wanted to do in interviews I've read with him. Regardless of intent, I thought the film was a fabulously intensive visual experience, and I felt I got a true sense of what things are like in a modern combat situation.                                    Discussion of the problems with the film get complex and difficult, since it's not entirely                                    clear what story or message the film wanted to tell. From a filmmaker's perspective,                                    this is a risky approach, and in so doing, has already alienated many people who feel                                    that the film leaves out too much context, or that the film should take a position on                                    whether we were doing the right thing by being there. Then again, when you're in battle,                                    it's easy to forget, let alone think about, the political or humanitarian reasons for your                                    presence, and the movie makes that abundantly clear.                                    But, taking the position of neutrality                                    through non-statements on either side of                                    the issue is not as ambitious as                                    neutrality through explicit expression of                                    both sides of the issue, as was done so                                    skillfully in the film, Dead Man                                    Walking. In that context, I felt Black Hawk Down paled dramatically to its potential. Even less excusable is that the skills of these mature and well-seasoned filmmakers could have taken those bold steps.                                   While the film's realism is violent and                                    bloody, it is not exploitive. Rather, it is                                    tastefully done such that anyone-as                                    uncomfortable as they may be seeing                                    such things-can have a better                                    appreciation for what real battle is all                                    about. It is also timely, as the very same powder keg in Somalia is once again back in                                    the news as this film is being released. In fact, the same warlords are still in power.                                    What we do about it now, as opposed to 1993, will be interesting to witness. One of the                                    effects of September 11 is that America had a rude awakening to the realities of a                                    harsher world with terrorists and anarchistic warlords. Seeing and understanding Black                                    Hawk Down is a sad, but necessary next step in our maturation process for world                                    events. It's only too bad that it didn't really take the bolder and more difficult step in                                    broaching the difficult and complex political and social issues.  ","genre":"Drama, History, War"},{"date":"19 January 2002","score":"","review":"  In the opening scene of Black Hawk Down, the plain white text on black                  background says calmly that the movie is based on actual events. This is an                  understatement. In the midst of reality-based entertainment, this film pushes the envelope the furthest so far, totally immersing you in a war environment like no other experience before. Director Ridley Scott re-creates a fierce 15-hour battle between besieged U.S. troops and Somali fighters on the streets of Mogadishu in 1993, in which 18 Americans were killed and 73 injured, along with thousands of Somali militia.

In fact, after the first hour I was much more interested in the amount of time remaining than I was in the movie. It was constant action, but it was also sort of boring. The reason is because the action was so constant and so consistently the same thing, that it was tiring long before it was over. Minus 1 point.I also deducted a point for the fact that not one single character was even remotely developed. You could EASILY have watched this movie without knowing a single name or a single personal characteristic about any character and you would have lost nothing. The reason is because there was virtually nothing to lose. Far too impersonal. It seems to me we should have been much more aware of at least what was at stake for several of the characters. Instead it was one constant blitz of bullets - the result of which, we really didn't care who got hit since we knew some would get killed and some wouldn't. Minus 1 point.Lastly, I am sick and tired of movies that have the same ludicrously unrealistic scene. Well, in this case, scene after scene after scene. Close your eyes. Imagine 50 soldiers in the street. Now imagine another 50 of the enemy (all with automatic weapons) in the windows and roofs surrounding the soldiers. Now imagine all of them shooting at each other with little cover. Thousands of rounds per minute. OBVIOUSLY, the 50 in the street would be dead within 30 seconds. Well, there you have it. There are numerous 5 minute scenes just exactly as I described where instead of 50 soldiers in the street getting killed, perhaps 3 got hit and they were successfully carried off.

The story, about a 15 year old kid in love with his step mother, is very bland and formulaic considering the opportunities presented by the subject matter. There are a few places where I laughed, but not many, and most of the jokes are predictable. Most of the scenes really, are played for cheap laughs, at the expense of the plot. For example (potential SPOILER ahead), when tadpole is at dinner with his father, step-mother, and step-mother's friend who he's slept with, there are several jokes built around the possibility that the step-mother's (40 year old) friend will reveal their liaison. The tension builds (or tries to build), until finally she does reveal it. However, nobody seems to care very much. Tadpole's father and step-mother express some surprise and there are some discussions about it between the step-mother and her friend, but the impact is very muted. Why was it written this way? Because they placed the cheap laughs before the plot. This would be fine if it were a comedy, but it seems to take itself very seriously. One of the only good things about this movie is that it goes one more step in showing cheap digital video (a Sony PD150 was used) as a viable format for a feature film.

The only thing to keep you on the edge of the seat at this point is the reflex to catch John Cleese's false teeth.It picks up again once the race is underway with things getting bigger, better, sillier and more tasteless as the movie progresses. Cuba Gooding Jnr looked desperately out of place and Whoopi Goldberg should have stayed at home. Seth Green, Vince Vieluf, Breckin Meyer, Amy Smart and Rowan Atkinson play the only characters of interest and make a good performance. All these characters had a lot more screen time and you wanted to go back to them while watching Whoopi, Cuba or Jon Lovitz. Dean Cain was supposedly in the film, but I missed him. I did see Lanai Chapman.The comedy was pretty silly and very tasteless, at least they didn't do any World Trade Tower gags. Vince's pierced tongue was quite a witty (and the only) piece of social commentary (made more funny near the end, but I don't want to give the joke away). Rowan plays a Bean-esque character, which fits in well, but I would rather have seen him play in a Black Adder style - however Seth Green already had the role of an absolute b*st*rd.Then you get to the end, which is very lame a disappointing. Given some of the jokes throughout the movie, the ending seems to be such a cop out. Smash Mouth put in an appearance (I thought it was Fred Durst until they introduced the band) and do one of their best songs.All in all, it is a good movie, just miss the beginning and miss the end. Definitely the funniest and only film I have seen so far this year.
