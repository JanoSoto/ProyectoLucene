[{"date":"30 January 2003","score":"","review":"  Bicentennial Man was a short story that Issac Asimov wrote before his I, Robot series.  This movie can only be described as the best interpretation of that story.  Only today do we have the technology to do a futuristic film.  The story is a classic Pinochio, but I am sure Issac Asimov would have been proud of this movie.  It is a must see for Sci-Fi buffs and tenderheart Halmark Channel watchers alike.
