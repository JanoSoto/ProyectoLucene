I dont for a second believe that he killed her. He just looks too much like a nice guy. And he never acts cold or seem dangerous. Not one time in the movie is he scary.This movie is way too long and the ending is very predictable. Hilary Swank is gorgeous and sexy, which is a nice change, compared to her previous roles. She also acts well. So does the girl who works at the hotel.Everybody else in the film is superficial and dont support the story in anyway. Pacinos partner Hap is a scumbag from the beginning and you dont even feel sorry for him when he dies.The town in the film is an excact copy of Twin Peaks, without the scary atmosphere, the show had.Another thing is, why didnt Pacino just kill Williams right away? That way, he would have solved his problems. And we didnt have to waste two hours of boredom, waiting for Williams whiny, pathetic killer to die.Why everybody thinks Wiliams is so great, is just beyond me.They should have cast Edward Norton as the killer instead. He can at least act and look scary when he needs to. He can be dangerous.Williams is just ridicoulus. He should stick to comedies and stay away from roles he clearly cant handle.

Morrissette jumps on the bandwagon that began in 1996 with Baz Luhrmann's `William Shakespeare's Romeo & Juliet,' which was followed by further spins on the bard's plays, including Julie Taymor's energetic and imaginative `Titus' in &#145;99 and Michael Almereyda's dreadful and dreary `Hamlet' in 2000.  Morrissette's offering-- which differs from the others in that it does not retain the Shakespearian language and verse-- falls somewhat beneath Luhrmann and Taymor's films, but far above Almereyda's dismal effort, which was a tragedy in ways that transcended the story.  Be advised, this one is a `black comedy' in every sense of the definition, and actually comes in on the absolute `darkest' end of the spectrum.  There's no getting around it, `Macbeth' is a depressing story to begin with, and this version decidedly captures the spirit of the play that inspired it.This story begins with a look at businessman Norm Duncan (James Rebhorn), who after selling his successful donut shops (`Duncan' Donuts, anyone?) has established a hamburger stand, which due in no small part to the innovative ideas of employee Joe McBeth (James LeGros) and the support of Joe's wife, Pat McBeth (Maura Tierney)-- also an employee of Duncan's-- has become a successful enterprise, as well as a harbinger of a chain of fairly well-known burger stands that start with `M' and today enjoy the lion's share of the fast-food market.  And now Norm has come up with his best idea yet, one that's going to take the simple burger stand into the future and put Duncan's at the top of the heap.It's a grand scheme alright, and Norm graciously shares his intentions with his best employees, Joe and Pat.  But there's a rub; the idea was originally Joe's, and Norm's taking the credit does not sit too well with the McBeth's, who envision a hamburger joint of their own, `McBeth's,' sitting beneath the huge arches formed by the big red `M' of the sign that stands above the entrance to the restaurant.  And the whole business goes south very quickly, as `Norm's' idea leads a seething Joe and Pat down a path that must necessarily end in murder and mayhem if their plan is, in fact, acted upon.  And is it?  For the answer to that, one must look no further than the source material, and keep in mind the term, `tragedy.'Billy Morrissette's is an interesting and fairly imaginative presentation, but in staying true to the essence of the play it takes you, finally, to a very dark place.  And even though he supplies a rather amusing ending infused with shrouded irony, be advised, this one's a downer; and it may seem something of a contradiction in terms, but it's going to make you laugh in spite of yourself.  And you'll hate yourself in the morning because of it.  Still, there's no denying that this is a clever, if just short of inspired, piece of filmmaking.  The single drawback is the casting of LeGros in the lead role; he does a decent job, even acceptable by most standards, but he lacks the screen presence and charisma to really sell it.  The part of Joe called for someone like Thomas Jay Ryan, who was so riveting in Hal Hartley's `Henry Fool' in 1998, a film which coincidentally featured another actor who could've pulled this part off successfully, and who happens to have a small, but pivotal role in this film, Kevin Corrigan.Corrigan, a terrific character actor and unsung veteran of a number of indy films, in this one plays Anthony `Banco' Banconi, a co-worker and friend of the McBeth's who significantly figures into the tragedy as it ultimately plays out.  Corrigan has the talent and just the kind of charismatic screen presence the role of Joe called for, and it's too bad that Morrissette and casting director Avy Kaufman didn't recognize the possibility that was right in front of them.They did strike gold, however, with the casting of Tierney as Pat McBeth.  She has a naturally endearing screen presence and expressive eyes that can speak volumes, which she uses to great effect here.  And, as she's demonstrated since becoming an integral member of the cast of TV's `ER,' she plays extremely well to her `dark' side, which is precisely what the role of Pat called for.  Needless to say, she does it quite well, turning in an altogether convincing and entirely believable performance.Another actor who plays so well to his dark side, Christopher Walken, does a solid turn here as Lt. Ernie McDuff, the investigator probing the shady goings-on at Duncan's hamburger stand.  In any role, Walken has a subtle, commanding presence, and this is no exception; here, though, he lends something of a light touch to the proceedings that is nevertheless in keeping with the seriousness of the story.  Suffice to say, he does black comedy well.  And, without question, it is Walken who `makes' the final shot of the film.The supporting cast includes Tom Guiry (Malcolm Duncan), Andy Dick (The Hippie Jesse), Amy Smart (The Hippie Stacy), Timothy `Speed' Levitch (The Hippie Hector), Geoff Dunsworth (Donald Duncan), John Cariani (doing a hilarious turn as Ed the Cop), Nate Crawford (Robert\/Richard) and Timothy Durkin (Frank the Pharmacist).  It may not be especially memorable, but `Scotland, Pa.' is just quirky enough to be a worthwhile entry in the Put-A-Spin-On-Shakespeare festival, currently playing on a DVD or video near you.

Ernie McDuff, the investigator probing the shady goings-on at Duncan's hamburger stand.  In any role, Walken has a subtle, commanding presence, and this is no exception; here, though, he lends something of a light touch to the proceedings that is nevertheless in keeping with the seriousness of the story.  Suffice to say, he does black comedy well.  And, without question, it is Walken who `makes' the final shot of the film.The supporting cast includes Tom Guiry (Malcolm Duncan), Andy Dick (The Hippie Jesse), Amy Smart (The Hippie Stacy), Timothy `Speed' Levitch (The Hippie Hector), Geoff Dunsworth (Donald Duncan), John Cariani (doing a hilarious turn as Ed the Cop), Nate Crawford (Robert\/Richard) and Timothy Durkin (Frank the Pharmacist).  It may not be especially memorable, but `Scotland, Pa.' is just quirky enough to be a worthwhile entry in the Put-A-Spin-On-Shakespeare festival, currently playing on a DVD or video near you.

The overall silliness of the first five minutes is anindicator that this is not a movie to take too seriously, which is fineif this were any kind of comedy-but it just isn't. It isn't campy, and itisn't funny in any parts. The potential for this film was much higherthan it turned out, especially with all the great talent of so many ofthe actors, and having such a unique idea for the main plot. BradPitt was excellent, as were so many of the supporting actors.Norton was not, but he had an impossible task doing somethingthe screenwriter and director wanted, but which was to be almostnot human at all. He was forced to be both very inhuman andinhumane. If someone is really inhuman, it is difficult for the viewerto empathize unless they have the same tendency of beingsociopathic. An inhumane sociopath is a fascinating film subject,but not if they are robotic. Yes, I'm over 45, but I enjoy many kinds of youthful films, or can atleast see why they are liked. I enjoy a wide variety of artistic,abstract, and strange films, as well as mainstream blockbusters. Ibase my opinion on overall excellence, not on technicalachievement. Actually a movie this bad, but at the same timeinnovative, would have benefitted from being made more lowbudget, without all the expensive scenery, props and specialeffects. Then it might have focused more on humans and havebetter insight into the main character's condition and mind, insteadof being merely hinted at, glossed over, and romanticized. All thegood and bad things that can justifiably be said about this film, themost truthful one that stands out the most is that it is just rawstupidity. I realize it is a fantasy story. But that a wimp like Nortoncould convince a horde of millions (all men-no women by the way,since women in the whole world are apparatently only inanimatesex objects) to convert to some sorry cult with no causes otherthan anarchism and individual brutality, is beyond stupidity. This film does have good technical qualities and some greatacting; and it does have content. Some special effects movieshave no real content or human interaction.

The saturation of the colours throughout the film make it all look cartoony, and the CGI does look like CGI although it is much improved on the previous film with Yoda at last looking real. I imagine this is where the majority of the work went on the film but it's just not good enough. I do wish that Lucas would get back to the gritty colour tones used in the first two films, they certainly added to the realism but the Disney look seems to have infected the franchise too deeply.Not only are many of the effects lacking any believability but Lucas can't direct action, something that is a major flaw in a film that has perhaps half of it as action scenes. We get lasers zapping everywhere but there is no coherence with the editing and it all ends up a bit confusing with none of the excitement that should be there.The problem with editing recurs throughout the film with the love story intercut with the discovery of the clone army badly done, why do we keep coming back from an interesting story to one that just turns people off, something that was obvious in the cinema as you could hear people groan everytime the teenage lovers were on.The sound though is superb, watching at home on my Dolby 51 did make it a bit more of an experience but if you are relying on technical details to carry a film then you really shouldn't be making it to start with. Anyone can buy a decent sound engineer for a movie, and just be limited by budget but not anyone can get a good performance out of an actor, then the limit is talent.Let's face it that George Lucas is nothing more than a glorified technician being way past his limits is trading on the goodwill of fans from movies he did 25 years ago.

","genre":"Action, Comedy, Crime"},{"date":"23 November 2002","score":"","review":"  This is one of those films that I like and I loathe, and I'll try to explain it why.  Get ready...First off, what I love about this movie.I love all of the actors especially Phillippe and Del Toro who turn in excellent performances as our two anti-hero protagonists, and of course, James Caan is the usual cool as ice character he normally plays.  Nicky Katt and Taye Diggs were simply awesome as the homicidal bodyguards who mostly let their actions speak louder than their words.  I love the directing, Christopher McQuarrie, the writer of The Usual Suspects, one of the best movies of all time, takes the helm as a first time director and does a remarkable job.  The gunfight at the end has some of the most impressive editing I have ever seen, and the whole movie is shot very well, especially for a first time director.  Speaking of the gunfights, I have to admit this, though I absolutely loved the psychological mind tricks of The Usual Suspects, and though this one has a few, somewhat sophomorish in comparison plot twists as well, what suckered me into buying this one after seeing it in the theaters were the intense and realistic gunfights.  Realistic as in there aren't any superhero a la Ahnold scenes where our heroes simply mow down the 'bad' guys, our heroes get pretty shot up during the course of the film, and especially in the end where Ryan Phillippe finds a nasty surprise after he vaults into an empty fountain.  Also, I was amazed at how accurate the filmmakers were with the authenicity of the guns themselves.  First off, there was no editing for the noises, those loud bangs you hear are the actual gunshots fired in real time by the actors.  I remember seeing this in the crappy college theater a few years ago...the gunshots literally shook the theater...I'm not kidding, they would make you jump out of your seat, which to me is incredible.  That kind of authentic detail is what really sold me into buying this movie, and plus, these guys carry Colt 1911 .45's, which each can hold a clip of 7 rounds...during the gunfights, they reload constantly, and you can count shot for shot, the 7 bullets almost everytime (except for one scene where Benicio is laying on the ground after being shot...minor gripe if anything), call me fastidious or obsessed with detail, but this was one of the few actioners that had gunfights that didn't have me groaning at some huge Hollywood inaccuracy.  You can tell the actors had fun 'shooting' (no pun intended!) these scenes, and the sound is incredible.Okay, those were the good points of the film, now onto the reasons why I can't give this one an 8 or a 9 rating.I can sum up my biggest complaint with this movie in one word.  Pacing. Pacing, or lack there of.  The beginning and end are very exciting, it's just that the middle 45 minutes or so can simply drag on and on.  There are times where the actors are speaking, and there is too much 'think' time and idle pauses to truly get involved with the scene.  I know some people don't mind this, but it drove me insane, I mean the film is around 2 hours, but it really feels like a 3 hour movie.  They could have trimmed this one to 90 minutes, and it still could have been a good movie.  You'll know exactly what I'm talking about if you watch this one...you'll go from one exciting gunfight to a scene where two characters are overanalyzing the plot and talking at their leisure about their view on the situation.  Also, there are scenes that make their point within the first 10 seconds, but drag on, with the same camera frame focused on the same character, usually just sitting there staring into the distance (like that freaky scene with the trophy wife staring at the ultra sound for like 5 minutes).  It is well directed, just poorly edited, which really kills the momentum of this flick.  The Usual Suspects had a wonderfully brilliant storyline that threw the viewer into a million twists and turns, yet, at a very exciting pace.  The Way of the Gun is similar, in this respect, yet, it will drag on and on and on until you feel like screaming at the TV, enough already!Like The Usual Suspects, McQuarrie provides many plot twists and turns, however he kind of goes overkill.  I mean, after a couple of viewings, I understand the whole plot, but to me, it is not really 'brilliant'.  We find out these plot twists not through intuition or a keen eye, but through the character's discussions, which last at least half of the movie, and often have a bunch of pointless filler.  I could tell some scenes (such as when they are playing hearts and Del Toro is explaining the rules of the game...which is supposed to be symbolic of the situation) were trying too hard to be inteligent or have a hidden meaning.  Also, in the beginning, we are treated to a series of scenes which sure as heck reminded me, and others as I've read the reviews, as another Pulp Fiction type movie.  I'm sorry, but the beginning screams of Pulp Fiction...the witty dialogue, the over the top violence in the beginning, the absolutely funny one-liners given at the sperm bank...hey, don't get me wrong, I loved this part of the movie, yet it is so out of place and is misleading to the viewer.  I'd say the movie is wonderful up until the kidnappers leave the gas station after seeing the doctor (who by the way is a really bad actor).  From there, you have about a 45 minute lull that is interesting at times, but will bore you to death at others, especially considering the great action in the beginning...you have to endure these 45 minutes in order to be rewarded with the other great action scenes at the end.  It's these 45 minutes or so that makes this one a hard choice for repeated viewings, and makes great use of the 'skip chapter' button on the dvd remote, at least once you understand the plot of the movie, which may take a few viewings to get.  Oh and btw, if you can't stand pregnancy scenes, just like I can't stand them, this is not the movie for you.  The scenes with Juliette Lewis are very graphic and a little too realistic.  Once again, bad editing is to blame...watching a pregnant woman scream in pain for 5 minutes at a time is simply unpleasant to watch...we get the point after the first 5 seconds!Okay, so I've listed the good and the bad (the ugly is probably in there too somewhere...) of this movie...for me I usually love or hate a film, this one is truly a black sheep to me, which is why I wrote an equally balanced review.  But, I must say, the good qualities do outweigh the bad ones, or why would I have bought the dvd?  This is a movie that not everyone will like, but is good to watch alone or with another movie buff.  It does make you think on some level, but don't expect another outing of The Usual Suspects...this one really tries too hard to be 'smart' and at times, 'hip'. But, it has some really impressive acting, great characters and action scenes that rival The Wild Bunch.  Speaking of that movie, you can tell that this one is a tribute or a copy to Sam Peckinpah's anti-hero western shoot-em-up.  Our 'heroes', Parker and Longbaugh simply have no desire to live and go for an all or nothing heist which goes terribly wrong (I love the line where Del Toro tells James Caan as they are having coffee that 'I don't think this is a brains sort of operation'), but they end up being, ironically, the most 'good' of all of the other characters (everyone is some sort of criminal or an up-to-no-gooder).  All in all, not a bad film, just like others have said, this could have been a great film which is why this review is so hard to write and is so torn between sides.  Like it or loathe it, this one will entertain you pretty well, just make sure that you keep the fast forward button primed and ready during the slow scenes, unless you haven't seen it before and want to understand the complex plot, which by the way, had me scratching my head the entire time during my first viewing. Now that I understand it though, it isn't exactly a life altering experience, though.  Anyways, watch this one for the acting and the action...I'd love to give this one a high rating, but I just can't...the editing is absolutely horrible.  That is my story, and I'm sticking to it.  6\/10 stars  ","genre":null},{"date":"23 November 2002","score":"","review":"  This is one of those films that I like and I loathe, and I'll try to explain it why.  Get ready...First off, what I love about this movie.I love all of the actors especially Phillippe and Del Toro who turn in excellent performances as our two anti-hero protagonists, and of course, James Caan is the usual cool as ice character he normally plays.  Nicky Katt and Taye Diggs were simply awesome as the homicidal bodyguards who mostly let their actions speak louder than their words.  I love the directing, Christopher McQuarrie, the writer of The Usual Suspects, one of the best movies of all time, takes the helm as a first time director and does a remarkable job.  The gunfight at the end has some of the most impressive editing I have ever seen, and the whole movie is shot very well, especially for a first time director.  Speaking of the gunfights, I have to admit this, though I absolutely loved the psychological mind tricks of The Usual Suspects, and though this one has a few, somewhat sophomorish in comparison plot twists as well, what suckered me into buying this one after seeing it in the theaters were the intense and realistic gunfights.  Realistic as in there aren't any superhero a la Ahnold scenes where our heroes simply mow down the 'bad' guys, our heroes get pretty shot up during the course of the film, and especially in the end where Ryan Phillippe finds a nasty surprise after he vaults into an empty fountain.  Also, I was amazed at how accurate the filmmakers were with the authenicity of the guns themselves.  First off, there was no editing for the noises, those loud bangs you hear are the actual gunshots fired in real time by the actors.  I remember seeing this in the crappy college theater a few years ago...the gunshots literally shook the theater...I'm not kidding, they would make you jump out of your seat, which to me is incredible.  That kind of authentic detail is what really sold me into buying this movie, and plus, these guys carry Colt 1911 .45's, which each can hold a clip of 7 rounds...during the gunfights, they reload constantly, and you can count shot for shot, the 7 bullets almost everytime (except for one scene where Benicio is laying on the ground after being shot...minor gripe if anything), call me fastidious or obsessed with detail, but this was one of the few actioners that had gunfights that didn't have me groaning at some huge Hollywood inaccuracy.  You can tell the actors had fun 'shooting' (no pun intended!) these scenes, and the sound is incredible.Okay, those were the good points of the film, now onto the reasons why I can't give this one an 8 or a 9 rating.I can sum up my biggest complaint with this movie in one word.  Pacing. Pacing, or lack there of.  The beginning and end are very exciting, it's just that the middle 45 minutes or so can simply drag on and on.  There are times where the actors are speaking, and there is too much 'think' time and idle pauses to truly get involved with the scene.  I know some people don't mind this, but it drove me insane, I mean the film is around 2 hours, but it really feels like a 3 hour movie.  They could have trimmed this one to 90 minutes, and it still could have been a good movie.  You'll know exactly what I'm talking about if you watch this one...you'll go from one exciting gunfight to a scene where two characters are overanalyzing the plot and talking at their leisure about their view on the situation.  Also, there are scenes that make their point within the first 10 seconds, but drag on, with the same camera frame focused on the same character, usually just sitting there staring into the distance (like that freaky scene with the trophy wife staring at the ultra sound for like 5 minutes).  It is well directed, just poorly edited, which really kills the momentum of this flick.  The Usual Suspects had a wonderfully brilliant storyline that threw the viewer into a million twists and turns, yet, at a very exciting pace.  The Way of the Gun is similar, in this respect, yet, it will drag on and on and on until you feel like screaming at the TV, enough already!Like The Usual Suspects, McQuarrie provides many plot twists and turns, however he kind of goes overkill.  I mean, after a couple of viewings, I understand the whole plot, but to me, it is not really 'brilliant'.  We find out these plot twists not through intuition or a keen eye, but through the character's discussions, which last at least half of the movie, and often have a bunch of pointless filler.  I could tell some scenes (such as when they are playing hearts and Del Toro is explaining the rules of the game...which is supposed to be symbolic of the situation) were trying too hard to be inteligent or have a hidden meaning.  Also, in the beginning, we are treated to a series of scenes which sure as heck reminded me, and others as I've read the reviews, as another Pulp Fiction type movie.  I'm sorry, but the beginning screams of Pulp Fiction...the witty dialogue, the over the top violence in the beginning, the absolutely funny one-liners given at the sperm bank...hey, don't get me wrong, I loved this part of the movie, yet it is so out of place and is misleading to the viewer.  I'd say the movie is wonderful up until the kidnappers leave the gas station after seeing the doctor (who by the way is a really bad actor).

As far as the nudity factor goes, at least I got my wish at the near end of the film, when those two hot babes stripped off their tops.  It kinda sucks that there was only brief nudity, but it's definitely a scene worth fast-forwarding to and rewinding over and over again. The most entertaining scene in the movie is when the victims are all cornered by Jason and don't know what the hell to do, until the robotic woman pops up like a warrior, in a scant leather outfit, holding a machine gun.

The acting is bad, but it was bad to the extent where it made me smile (rather than cringe).  The dialogue is also bad, but it made me laugh, and it sort of parodies the cheesy lines we hear in many trashy horror flicks.  Cool death scenes, hot chicks, great moments of humor, one great nude scene.  What more can I ask for?  I'm not quite sure, but I felt the movie was missing something, which prevented it from making it any more than a slightly above-average film--at least in my opinion.  There was a certain aura of dullness to it, though I still had a good deal of fun.  Nevertheless, it's definitely worth watching and worth renting on DVD (there's a great commentary and a great documentary about the Jason flicks).  You pretty much have nothing to lose.  But I really wish they could've played Let the Bodies Hit the Floor somewhere in the film, because it sounded awesome in the trailer.  Once again, I must say  Stop playing music in trailers if it's not gonna be in the film!

My first viewing was a disaster.  Not because the movie was bad, but because my dad kept complaining.  The movie contains bundles of profanity, though it's all in good taste.  But when your dad's a senior citizen and hears the f word repeated over and over and over again, taste isn't a factor. My second viewing was a lot more liberating.  I saw it in my film class with my peers, most of them around my age, and most of them seemed to enjoy it, lots of them were laughing their butts off.  It was the perfect atmosphere.  And I was also laughing my butt off.  This is a hilarious, hilarious film that anyone can enjoy, whether or not you're a fan of politics.  I know a little about politics, but I've never been a fan of it.  Yet I loved this movie.  I also like Warren Beatty, but I understand some people don't and characterize him as dull and deadpan.  Well, after watching Beatty rap, wear ghetto clothing, get high on weed and do some dirty dancing with Halle Berry--let's see how many of you STILL think he's dull and deadpan.  This is definitely a different role for Beatty, and I can actually say it was an ingenious thing to cast himself for the lead.  The supporting cast is great as well.  Some felt that Halle Berry's character wasn't really needed and that the romance between her and Beatty could've been excluded.  Maybe they're right, maybe they're wrong.  I was so engrossed in the film that the romance didn't seem like a burden to me.  And Halle did a fine job with her role, showing that she can play a glamour girl as well as a girl from the streets (her role in Jungle Fever is also evidence).  Oliver Platt steals a few scenes as Beatty's hilariously neurotic right hand man.  I love Platt, and he's high up on my list of favorite underrated actors, and this is definitely one of his best performances, though he isn't on screen that long.  Also adding to this list of supporting talent are Don Cheadle, Jack Warden, Laurie Metcalf and Paul Sorvino.This is purely a fantasy about what would happen if a politician were really to speak the truth, but it's a wonderful fantasy.  What more can I say?  This is a hilarious satire that I recommend to anyone except for the easily offended.  Go see Bulworth!My score  9 (out of 10)  P.S.  I must add that the soundtrack is hot!  It includes the song Ghetto Superstar, which I still think is a cool song.
