Add Jack Nicholson and this was a sure-fire hit for me.Well, not exactly. While it is pretty well done and has an interesting story, and is also really funny (okay, okay, VERY funny), it doesn't really seem to add anything especially significant to either Ashby's or Nicholson's works. Nicholson is basically himself, the humor isn't particularly in the same vein as Harold and Maude, and Ashby doesn't seem to have improved much as a director, but that can be forgiven as it was immediately proceeding Harold and Maude and wasn't made that far after.But enough of the negative stuff. This movie is really, really funny, and the best part about its humor is that it doesn't seem to fall into any particular vein of comedy like dark humor or slapstick or the like, but more of just a straightforward silliness that's willing to go right where it needs to for a laugh. Sometimes the jokes get a little predictable, but during those times it seems the predictability of the humor kind of helps it along.It's about 3 Navymen, one who seems to be a kleptomaniac and is being sent to jail for stealing forty dollars from a Navy charity fund, and the two others that have to take him there. One, played by Nicholson, recognizes both the innocence of the kleptomaniac and the frustration of his partner, so carries them along on a journey to have as much fun as they can while they can.Everyone did pretty well, and it's a real joy to watch. I'm going to have to watch it some more before I comment definitively on the ending, because it seems to a point to be sort of a cop-out way of tying everything together, but I can't quite be sure.--PolarisDiB ","genre":null},{"date":"11 November 2005","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Ashby could almost be named one of my favorite directors for Harold and Maude alone.

A recent survey of high school seniors found that a majority could not place the American Civil War in its proper half-century.In a way, it's not too bad to have moguls in charge of things instead of a committee of MBAs whose eyes dart first to the bottom line. It USED to be this way in the movies when there was still a studio system and the Louis B. Mayers and Sam Goldwyns and Harry Cohns could manage (or mismanage) their empires as they liked. It used to be that way in publishing too. Mr. Simon and Mr. Schuster and Mr. Knopf and Mr. Scribner could print whatever they liked, even if they thought it would turn out to be a quality loser instead of an immensely profitable but brainless blockbuster.That's all pretty much changed now, and a lot of people would argue not for the better. So you have to give Ted Turner a lot of credit for financing this expensive production. As Ronald F. Maxwell, the director, put it -- He followed his passion.

For what it's worth, the staging of the scene in which Lt. Chamberlain chats with three Confederate prisoners is copied directly from a Winslow Homer painting.It's an excellent movie, blending character study with action. Of the performances, I thought among the best were Sheen as Lee, Lang as Pickett, Jordan as Armistad, and Mallon, who played Winfield Scott Hancock. Not that the other performances were poor. They're all up to professional snuff but, well, for instance, how much could Jeff Daniels do with a character who is a taciturn and inexpressive New Englander beyond speaking his lines woodenly? I should also mention Lancaster as the British observer. He's pretty good. He comes across at first as simpering and dressed like a bellboy in a fancy French hotel, but when the situation calls for it his head tilts back and his eyes narrow searchingly. He does a splendid job of being just friendly enough to absorb information without expressing any opinions about the events he witnesses. It's a small part but nicely done. Stephen Lang's General Pickett is a descendant of the cavaliers who settled the South, gentlemanly, proud, brave, and filled with a kind of Errol Flynn factor. Sheen's Lee is thoughtful, religious, and wrong in his decisions. Jeb Stuart has a small part, as he did in the battle itself. He was given to riding in complete circles around the opposing Federal army and he did it at Gettysburg too, but that wasn't his job.I won't go on about the story of the battle itself because, if the MBAs are correct in their assumptions about us, any further discussion of the battle would be a spoiler. So -- no hints about who won. (PS There is no Confederate States of America anymore.) What a bloody and stupid war that was. Well, they all are of course, but some are unavoidable while others seem even more irrational than most. And the emotions generated by that conflict seem to persist beyond any real reason. It wasn't that long ago that roadside stands in the South displayed beach towels picturing a tattered Confederate soldier carrying the battle flag over his shoulder, and the caption, Hell no, we won't forget.

Oh, sure, maybe the public will watch an ageless soap opera like Gone With the Wind but a movie about nothing but a BATTLE? No women in it? No slashers? No aliens or car chases or huge explosions or sex? Americans seem to have little interest in their own history. A recent survey of high school seniors found that a majority could not place the American Civil War in its proper half-century.In a way, it's not too bad to have moguls in charge of things instead of a committee of MBAs whose eyes dart first to the bottom line. It USED to be this way in the movies when there was still a studio system and the Louis B. Mayers and Sam Goldwyns and Harry Cohns could manage (or mismanage) their empires as they liked. It used to be that way in publishing too. Mr. Simon and Mr. Schuster and Mr. Knopf and Mr. Scribner could print whatever they liked, even if they thought it would turn out to be a quality loser instead of an immensely profitable but brainless blockbuster.That's all pretty much changed now, and a lot of people would argue not for the better. So you have to give Ted Turner a lot of credit for financing this expensive production. As Ronald F. Maxwell, the director, put it -- He followed his passion. (Cf., Joseph Campbell, Follow your bliss.) You have to give the reenactors credit for following their passions too. I doubt that they were paid although I expect they were fed. For what it's worth, the staging of the scene in which Lt. Chamberlain chats with three Confederate prisoners is copied directly from a Winslow Homer painting.It's an excellent movie, blending character study with action. Of the performances, I thought among the best were Sheen as Lee, Lang as Pickett, Jordan as Armistad, and Mallon, who played Winfield Scott Hancock. Not that the other performances were poor. They're all up to professional snuff but, well, for instance, how much could Jeff Daniels do with a character who is a taciturn and inexpressive New Englander beyond speaking his lines woodenly? I should also mention Lancaster as the British observer. He's pretty good. He comes across at first as simpering and dressed like a bellboy in a fancy French hotel, but when the situation calls for it his head tilts back and his eyes narrow searchingly. He does a splendid job of being just friendly enough to absorb information without expressing any opinions about the events he witnesses. It's a small part but nicely done. Stephen Lang's General Pickett is a descendant of the cavaliers who settled the South, gentlemanly, proud, brave, and filled with a kind of Errol Flynn factor. Sheen's Lee is thoughtful, religious, and wrong in his decisions. Jeb Stuart has a small part, as he did in the battle itself. He was given to riding in complete circles around the opposing Federal army and he did it at Gettysburg too, but that wasn't his job.I won't go on about the story of the battle itself because, if the MBAs are correct in their assumptions about us, any further discussion of the battle would be a spoiler. So -- no hints about who won. (PS There is no Confederate States of America anymore.) What a bloody and stupid war that was. Well, they all are of course, but some are unavoidable while others seem even more irrational than most. And the emotions generated by that conflict seem to persist beyond any real reason. It wasn't that long ago that roadside stands in the South displayed beach towels picturing a tattered Confederate soldier carrying the battle flag over his shoulder, and the caption, Hell no, we won't forget. Why not? Nobody who fought that war is still alive. It's the sort of sentiment that will lead to the next war and the one after that.The production could have used more maps though. We get exchanges like this, between General Buford and a courier. What is Heath doing? He says to tell you he's putting in his reserves, sir, but not all of them. What should I tell Heath? Tell him to put in his reserves -- ALL of them. Who and where is Heath? Why should he put in all of his reserves?

By all means a good one though.A highly deadly and contagious virus breaks loose in a little town. The government will do anything in it's hands to stop it from spreading, but some certain ranking officers sees the potential for a biologic weapon.The story starts out all right with the thrilling search for answers by doctors and I was hoping it would stay that way. But, as time went by they military theme of the story got more and more involved and at the end it turned out to be just another military movie and that had me a bit disappointed. While it started out as something that could be original and different it turned out to be something we've all seen before. The characters are good. They go well together and you get to know them. There are a nice mix of different types of characters and relationships so they can add humor, dramatic elements and everything they want and make it work.Dustin Hoffman, Renee Russo, Morgan Freeman, Kevin Spacey, Donald Sutherland and Cuba Gooding Jr. This movie features a bunch of good actors and none of them are having a bad day. They fit their characters and portrays them well. There are nothing else to say about the cast other than excellent. The supporting actors delivers as well. The acting is the best thing about this movie.The cinematography is OK. It's pretty casual, nothing too daring or out of the ordinary. Simply good shots, with good composition and lightning. It captures this movie well and that's what it does.When it comes to effects, the make-up is very good. They don't overdo it, it's believable and it looks good. There are some other CGI explosions that don't quite meet today's standards, but it's good for 1995 and then there are the real explosions that looks good. There are some pretty nice chopper flying in here. It's quite impressive, tense and well captured.The score by James Newton Howard is good. It's really tense in the action scenes and really moody in other scenes. It supports the story and works quite well.Outbreak is a entertaining movie, but nothing too original. It's cast is great, but the story nothing special. They don't use the outbreak for what it's worth, but pollute it with all this military stuff. They don't use the full potential.

The voodoo priests on the island assume control and begin to practice their dangerous spells on the population. Dennis Alan, (Bill Pullman) a botanist working in the Amazon basin, is exploring the uses of a psychotic drug used there and has to crawl his way through the jungle to get back home. Once there, he is sent to investigate the discovery of a zombie in Haiti. Skeptical at first, David goes with the best of intentions to now how to reanimate the dead. When he arrives at the hospital that houses the rumored zombie, he is introduced to a powerful voodoo priest's ceremony. There he meets Lucien Celine, (Paul Winfield) a personal friend of Marielle Duchamp, (Cathy Tyson) one of the nurses. As he continues his relentless pursuit of the zombie drug, Dennis is immersed into the world of voodoo and ancient spells that goes way over his head. Tortured by what he knows and what he feels is going to happen to Marielle, David has to fight for his very soul amidst the powerful voodoo priests.The Good News This is one of the very few horror films ever made that treats it's subject matter as accurately as possible. It's true that all the depiction's and discussions about voodoo and its power are real. Those are real practitioners of voodoo performing on film, and how it happens in the film are real representations of how voodoo works. That adds to the realism to the film, because real-life horror is far scarier than anything else a human mind can come up with. To me, the world of voodoo is something that is beyond merely tampering with, and this film is a wonderful guiding principal for those who might be interested in it. Whatever the people in the film are doing to the regular characters to turn them into zombies are very powerful people, and the spells and potions used to control and create them are just as powerful. This gets so much better when he has been overwhelmed with the voodoo world, and everything comes crashing down on his world. The practice of making a zombie is fully explored, and the process is an incredibly creepy one. We get to know it in intricate detail, and the realness of it makes it that much more compelling. Once he knows the process of creating the drug, the movie kicks into hyper-drive as he is just relentlessly tortured by what he knows, and that it happens in a quick manner of time is staggering. What really gets to you is the dream sequences he keeps having. My favorite is the first one, early on in the film. He dreams he's inside this candlelit room and witnesses a wedding being performed. The bride wanders over to him with the veil down, and as she gets close to him, he lifts the veil to reveal the bride is a charred corpse. She pulls her mouth down, and out shoots it's tongue and latches onto his chin. One of my favorite scenes in the film, and one of the biggest scares in a movie as well. Another big one is the part where he's dissolved into a wall of blood, that was a creepy scene. It was also nice since the torture inflicted on him was more mental than physical. And what needs to be said for the heart-stopping climax? It is justifiably famous, and it is a true twist ending that hardly anyone will be able to spot coming, yet is completely in tone with the rest of the movie. It really is one of the best endings to a film ever.The Bad News Because of the supernatural and religious themes portrayed in the film are very accurate, it may upset the very religious persons out there.

This movie, however, was too much. I was at a friend's house and I had not yet seen Star Wars Attack of the Clones. I was somewhat afraid because I love the original Star Wars movies, and I even enjoyed the third one (though it was not nearly as good as the originals). However, I hated Star Wars Episode I. As I sat on the couch waiting for the movie to begin, I wondered if I would like it. Little did I know, I would have much rather been in Uganda doing manual labor than having to sit through that awful movie. Here are my reasons 1) The dialog was terrible (I know George Lucas has never been known for great dialog...but this was just unfathomable) 2) Mr. Lucas tried to make the movie into some sort of drama (I'm speaking for Episodes I and III also) rather than sticking to the fun originals. 3) He tried to make the audience feel Anakin's deep inner struggles but it turned into a flop because the dialog was such as I...I...I just can't breathe without you. and Where I come from it is so rocky, but here it's so soft and smooth. 4) George Lucas had an interesting idea of dwelling on how Anikan became Darth Vader, but he didn't have enough to go on so he tried filling the rest in with bits and scraps that made the movie look poorly put together. After I watched the movie (barely being able sit through it at all) I went and did something productive like renting the The Grapes of Wrath which is actually good. I understand that if you're some sort of Star Wars fanatic you'll think me an idiot and you'll say this is the best movie that' s been made in the past 10 years.

This movie, however, was too much. I was at a friend's house and I had not yet seen Star Wars Attack of the Clones. I was somewhat afraid because I love the original Star Wars movies, and I even enjoyed the third one (though it was not nearly as good as the originals). However, I hated Star Wars Episode I. As I sat on the couch waiting for the movie to begin, I wondered if I would like it. Little did I know, I would have much rather been in Uganda doing manual labor than having to sit through that awful movie. Here are my reasons 1) The dialog was terrible (I know George Lucas has never been known for great dialog...but this was just unfathomable) 2) Mr. Lucas tried to make the movie into some sort of drama (I'm speaking for Episodes I and III also) rather than sticking to the fun originals. 3) He tried to make the audience feel Anakin's deep inner struggles but it turned into a flop because the dialog was such as I...I...I just can't breathe without you. and Where I come from it is so rocky, but here it's so soft and smooth. 4) George Lucas had an interesting idea of dwelling on how Anikan became Darth Vader, but he didn't have enough to go on so he tried filling the rest in with bits and scraps that made the movie look poorly put together. After I watched the movie (barely being able sit through it at all) I went and did something productive like renting the The Grapes of Wrath which is actually good.

Soon the pair - mother and son - are teaming up to track down a mother-killer and...oh yeah...in between we get loads of lame gags about how desperately aggravating mothers can be.This would have been a really great film - if it were three minutes long. The material is barely enough to sustain a Saturday Night Live skit - even then it would be aggravating. The plot is cutesy - so are all the gags, lines and characters. I felt like b****-slapping Estelle Getty and you know there's something wrong when you want to beat up an old woman.The plot basically works like this, scene after scene 1. Annoying Mother Figure tries to control Son's life.2. Son is angry. He tells her he likes having his underwear strewn across the floor and likes to leave the seat up.3. Annoying Mother Figure tells him he'll never get a wife this way, and mentions his ex-girlfriend who left him.4. Son Figure rolls his eyes and says Oh Mom, don't bring that up again. 5.

It became an audience favourite, received universal praise from critics, won the Best Film at the Cannes Film Festival, and made director Quintin Tarantino into a household name. How many films out there can you fit into this category?Pulp Fiction is so famous for several reasons. First off, it's one of the most original films of the 90's. When most movies out there are either remakes, sequels, based on books, or on actual events, Tarantino gives us 2-inch sirloin steak that's bloody as hell. The plot is several stories all interelated in someway or another that weave in and out over a period of about 48 hours (give or take and afternoon) all within the shifty comings and goings of the LA drug life. Each story connects the characters together, like a puzzle within a puzzle, and is all held together strongly with a fantastic cast (John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thurman, Bruce Willis) and Acadamy Award worthy performances.Secondly, it has tremendous dialogue. Quintin Tarantino is an absolute genius in crafting the film's Oscar winning screenplay. This isn't made up nonsense. This stuff is real. Many of the dialogue you could so easily overhear from the people talking behind you in the grocery line. They're conversations of reality, and this is what helps make the film so good. And when it has to be, the script is sharp as a razor blade in which Samuel L. Jackson deserves much praise for. Thirdly, it is amazingly memorable. Most movies would be lucky to have about 2 memorable scenes; Pulp Fiction has about nine. Mia Wallace and Vincent Vega's fantastic twist dance scene became of the most iconic scenes of the 90's (I will admit I tried a few moves in front of my bedroom mirror). Mia getting stabbed with a syringe makes everyone's knees knock and who doesn't laugh darkly at Winston Wolf's scenes. The acting, the story, the characters, everything just works. That's all as I can describe it.After watching Pulp Fiction, everything else will seem like bread and water. So don't be afraid to watch this wildly outrageous, fantastic, bloody, and often surreal film that turned the 90's upside down. It's all that and a bag of chips. Get out there and rent it.

And when it has to be, the script is sharp as a razor blade in which Samuel L. Jackson deserves much praise for. Thirdly, it is amazingly memorable. Most movies would be lucky to have about 2 memorable scenes; Pulp Fiction has about nine. Mia Wallace and Vincent Vega's fantastic twist dance scene became of the most iconic scenes of the 90's (I will admit I tried a few moves in front of my bedroom mirror). Mia getting stabbed with a syringe makes everyone's knees knock and who doesn't laugh darkly at Winston Wolf's scenes. The acting, the story, the characters, everything just works. That's all as I can describe it.After watching Pulp Fiction, everything else will seem like bread and water. So don't be afraid to watch this wildly outrageous, fantastic, bloody, and often surreal film that turned the 90's upside down. It's all that and a bag of chips. Get out there and rent it.

It is surprisingly quite effective overall, and I say surprisingly because there are a number of detractors. The first problem comes from the film spending the first 45 minutes juggling three different lines of story. This causes breaks in intensity and interest levels as it switches between the different story lines. After 45 minutes two of them eventually come together, but it is almost halfway through the film when all the fragments of storyline are finally put together. The second half of the film has another problem with much excessive violence. While the story does require an amount of violence, the film seems to use violence as a spectacle, and some of the scenes are rather repulsive. It makes some sense for all the action to be a representation of the emotions of the characters, but it is just overdone here. The film has a few other minor detractors such as a lack of depth into McCarthyism, Nazism and other issues that it brings up. Some story elements feel abandoned quite awkwardly too. Even with all these things against it, the film comes through quite well, with many intriguing sequences and interesting parts nonetheless. The quality of the acting is quite good, and the dark vision of the material suits it well. It is a good film, even if one with concentration on the thrills above all else.

Ullman tells Jack that he will be responsible for the basic upkeep of the hotel but will be almost totally isolated from the rest of the world for six months as the harsh Winter sets in. Together with his wife Wendy (Shelley Duvall) & young son Danny (Danny Lloyd) Jack moves into the hotel & at first everything seems fine, it's a beautiful hotel, absolutely huge & whatever they need is at their disposal. However the Overlook hotel has a murky past with a previous caretaker murdering his entire family before committing suicide & Danny has the ability to 'shine' which means he has psychic powers that let him see & hear things 'ordinary' people can't. As the days, weeks & months begin to pass Jack become more & more insane, Danny keeps 'seeing' things & people while Wendy becomes frantic as she doesn't have a clue what's happening to her family, as a heavy snowstorm leaves them trapped Jack finally loses it...This English production was co-written, co-produced & directed by Stanley Kubrick & is a fine horror film. It appears that The Shining is another film that exists in two distinct different versions & the one I will be commenting on is the shorter European cut that runs just under 2 hours in length. The script by Kubrick & Diane Johnson, is based on the novel by Stephen King which I have not read so I can't compare them, goes for psychological horror rather than visual with only one murder during the entire film. There are very few character's in The Shining with Jack, Wendy & Danny the only ones that really matter, since the film concentrates on them almost exclusively you care for them, become involved with them & what they go through. The pace is somewhat slow but this is one film that didn't feel that long & keeps you interested throughout. On the negative side I don't think the reasoning behind Jack going crazy & wanting to kill his family was strong enough to convince me, the fact that Jack escapes from the freezer without any explanation bugs me & I don't know if I missed something but that ending didn't make any sense to me whatsoever, I'm still trying to work out what that picture is all about! There is very little in the way of violence or gore, a couple of rotten zombie ghosts & someone is killed with an axe but The Shining is a horror film that doesn't need to rely on blood & special effects as it has a gripping story. With a budget of about $19,000,000 The Shining is technically flawless as you would expect from an obsessive filmmaker such as Kubrick, the cinematography is brilliant with some fantastic free-flowing & smooth steadicam shots as the camera effortlessly follows the character's around the maze of corridors, the sets look absolutely real & instead of clichéd old haunted house themes like dark corners, basements & cobwebs Kubrick brings things right up-to-date with brightly lit corridors, massive open expansive spaces & a modern decor (well 80's modern, just check that red toilet out!). The acting is good from everyone involved although as usual in horror films the little kid is highly annoying & Nicholson seems crazy from the very start. The Shining is an absorbing film that I enjoyed watching although I'm not sure I'd watch it again anytime soon. For those looking for explosions & fancy special effects you will be disappointed, for those looking for a good haunted house type horror with a strong story I definitely think The Shining is for you, well worth a watch in my humble opinion.

I doubt that anyone could make an ordinary war film anymore. Slow, cheap ones like Sam Fuller's or even innovative grunt's-view stories like Platoon. If you're going to make a war movie now, Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan is the bogie you have to match. It is the fate of rebels to found orthodoxies.And what an innovation this movie was. Oliver Stone must be applauded for tackling a subject like the Vietnam war that was so controversial that the conflict was avoided for more than ten years, because of the still smoldering emotions the war had generated. If Vietnam had been a human being it would have had to stalk around dressed in rags, tinkling a little bell, and crying Unclean, unclean. Saving Private Ryan's subject is less controversial. First, the enemy really WAS our enemy. (Germany declared war on the USA first, not the other way around.) Second, well -- we won, didn't we? But it is probably more original in its details. And candid too. A German and an American soldier are locked in bitter mano a mano conflict, and the German wins! And not by cheating either! He is the bigger man and finally overpowers the American and inch by inch sinks the American's own bayonet into his chest. He does not gloat or smile. It's no tennis game to the German, but a deadly necessity, just as it is for the American soldier. Relax, the German pants in a low voice, it's very simple, as the tip of the knife slowly penetrates the American's chest. The scene is phenomenally stark.The most complex character is Upham's. The rest of the Americans play their assigned roles, performing impossible feats of bravery. This is precisely what the Germans are doing too. But Upham fails at a crucial point and costs the lives of his allies. The viewer can sit back and make Olympian judgments about Upham's character, but consider that for every hour Upham spent in combat he was as valiant as everyone else for fifty-five minutes. He translated, was almost run over by a tank, ran across open spaces under fire, and carried ammunition. But those fifty-five minutes don't count on his side, only the five during which he was frozen in tonic immobility, a fundamental mammalian trait which -- not having been in Upham's place ourselves -- we can condemn him for.Maybe nobody can define an anti-war movie. They ALL claim to be anti-war movies. How could you possibly market a PRO-war movie unless we were formally at war with another nation? To many people, an anti-war movie is a simple excuse to give us more action and more blood. Put Steven Segal in combat boots. Others are anti-war because they give us a glimpse of the enemy's humanity somewhere along the line. But in all the anti-war movies we always seem to win, as indeed we do in Saving Private Ryan. (The cavalry comes galloping to the rescue.) All war movies, even those depicting a defeat like Pearl Harbor, seem to endorse the same bumper-sticker slogan No matter how sneaky or noble they may be, they can't whip us. I guess it takes an enormous amount of courage -- in Hollywood -- to ask an audience to pay money to see a movie in which we lose a war or a battle or a fist fight with an enemy. It's what I admire about a movie as flawed as A Bridge Too Far. And it's what makes me feel more involved in the tragedy shown in Saving Private Ryan. That hand-to-hand fight that the American loses contravenes established war narratives. What? We LOSE? It's as shocking as Hitchcock's killing of Janet Leigh half-way through Psycho.
