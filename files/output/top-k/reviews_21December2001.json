Unfortunately for Spielberg & Co., Pixar would come to Disney's rescue again. Pixar seem absolutely infallible, and they fortify that feeling with Monsters, Inc.  Monsters, Inc. is a funnier and warmer film than Shrek and, to me, that forms the most important part of a good animated film. It still doesn't quite reach the peak as Toy Story and A Bug's Life did, but the difference is slim.    The story is extremely original and well-written and is bound to keep both adults and kids pinned to their seats through the whole film. (Only one kid started crying, which must be considered acceptable casualties since the film is about monsters.) Even the ending is cut right before the last mandatory reconciliation, making it much stronger. If the story or the incredibly entertaining characters won't do it for you, the animation surely will. There are some details and scenes here never done before. This is, technically, the best achievement in CGI filmmaking so far.  As a footnote, before the movie you will be fortunate enough to see Pixar's 3-minute short For the Birds, which is the funniest short film I have ever seen.

Rowling's work, I was quite curious to see if the reasons for her recent publishing phenomenon would be apparent from the film adaptation. Unfortunately the answer is a resounding 'no'.The story combines two main themes, public school and wizardry, both of which are dealt with in somewhat traditional fashion. In fact the portrayal of Harry's schooling is very typically British and covers the usual ground - school traditions and rituals, house rivalries, etc. Rowling's approach to witchcraft is similarly conventional and will be familiar to viewers of all ages, i.e. wands, broomsticks, and bubbling potions.If the appeal of the book has more to do with the style of writing than the plot and subject matter, then again there was little sign of this in the big screen version. The direction and editing are best described as solid and competent, rather than refreshing or inventive, happy to tread cautiously in preference to taking risks.As for the acting, I was again left unmoved. In recent years we have been treated to some sparkling performances from young leads (Sixth Sense and Billy Elliott immediately spring to mind), but unfortunately the portrayal of Harry was uninspired and rather wooden at times. The rest of the cast where OK, yet I did not feel that anyone stood out in particular.These criticisms aside, the film does contain many elements which will appeal to children. There is plenty of good old fashioned action sequences, childhood rivalries, the first awakenings of young love, and a healthy dose of humour. Although there are some moments of tension and suspense, the general feel of the move is quite light-hearted and doesn't take itself too seriously.All in all its a well made, run of the mill, children's adventure yarn, which should provide decent entertainment for all the family. However a classic it isn't. It lacks the freshness and originality of Toy Story or Shrek, whilst falling well short of The Fellowship of the Ring in terms of visual impact. Since J.K. Rowling was in close contact with the production team I wonder how closely the end product matches her vision?
