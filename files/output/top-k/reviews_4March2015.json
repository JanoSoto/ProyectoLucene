He is forced to endure a psychological process that Full Metal Jacket brilliantly sets in its first half. The film opens on an island where the Platoon 3042 constituted of young soldiers-to-be, is confronted to a rough training, conducted by a merciless instructor. There, in this isolated training camp, begins a process during which they are deprived of identity, pride and almost come to lose their awareness of an outside-world. In the second part of the film, the training is over and they are released into the savage context of the Vietnam War to be faced with death.Many a film was made before this one and has been since, following the same trail, dealing with harsh trainings and the progressive dehumanisation of soldiers. However, it has not prevented director Stanley Kubrick from stepping out of the mass with a brilliantly constructed plot and organized movie. The soldiers are introduced to a mechanical system through which they are constantly repeating their actions, reminded of their littleness, perfectly aligned, shouting their robotic answers to the chief's questions with the same voice. When joining the platoon, they lose the individuality of their appearances, they lose their names to take on comical nicknames such as Joker, Cowboy or Gomer Pyle, they lose their sense of shame... Difference is scorned while servitude is promised immortality.Somehow, while witnessing the soldier's transformation, we are left wandering who these men's real enemy is if not war itself. The frontier between the soldier and the criminal grows thinner to the point when themselves lose track of which they are. Leaving the training, they may be returning to a more 'common' fight, it will have nonetheless affected each one of them permanently. In a way, the second part of the movie is rendered obsolete by the virtuosity of the first and the image it gives of the warrior resembles the one we already had  a sense of brotherhood, a little bragging, a need for heroism, but also fear, on entering the battlefield.War itself has been depicted in many ways before today. For his part, Kubrick has chosen a 43 frame as is his habit, to tighten our vision and therefore match the soldiers'. The use of straight lines and symmetry enhances the unity of the military world. There is also a subtle balance between dark humor and brutality made possible by the mastering of the dialogs. In addition, Kubrick's knowledge of philosophy and psychology adds to the movie when, for instance, he evokes the duality of men or has the soldiers unconsciously associate the act of killing with the feeling of love and care.I would totally recommend this movie while warning the viewer that it is quite violent (though justifiably). Without wanting to spoil anything, I would invite him to pay attention to the references that are made and the relations between some parts of the movie and other... such as the sound of water-drops falling or of a laughter echoing.

She loves to play with real people with real ideas, only to marginalize their fake disguises, that is, to bring out their true-selves. Occasionally, she is betrayed by her humanitarian instincts which humiliate her for plunging into things that do not directly concern her, but that's a necessary stake. With colorful reasoning and pondering, most of which are deceitful and wild, she tends to look-up the hidden good behind everything around.

I would therefore laud the writer, because the imagery of set, angles, minute details (yes, like the one where Amelie notices an insect on the screen behind the couple in a movie) and order are almost entirely on writer's shoulders; this has surely been one of the finest pieces of written art I've ever seen.The world of Amelie is unique. She creates modified models of it, while accepting the world as it is, and this is a great gift. If we start having people who are like her, we wouldn't be the whining fags that we are.

As the film progresses, Woodward is progressively more and more baffled and horrified by the pagan religious practices of the residents of the island, ending in twist at the end I won't ruin, because I don't want to detract from the film's impact. It could be a product being raised in the 90s and 00's where everyone is so concerned with freedom of self expression and political correctness, but I find Woodwards character to be stuck up, needlessly hostile, xenophobic and generally unlikable. He is a devoted Christian man being thrust into a pagan world, and his indigence makes sense for the character, but I found the character the be largely unlikable. His character is contrasted by Christopher Lee, who plays Lord Sumerisle, is obviously hiding something concerning the disappearance of the young girl. He is kind, cordial, and very patient with Woodward's hostility. To me, this sets up a very interesting dichotomy. You have the main character, a man the audience relates to, because he is a lay man from a normal, religious world. But even though we relate to him he is unlikable. Then you have the character of Sumerisle, who lives a baffling life with an archaic religion. So he seems wrong, but is the obviously more personable character. By the end of the movie these lines are so blurred for me i don't know who i like and who i hate. And I LOVE it. By the end of the movie, both parties display religious zealotry that seem insane, given the circumstance.The use of music in this movie is incredibly odd at first, but believe me, if you go with it, it adds so much to the atmosphere you wont be able to think of a standard score being effective.

Unlike the original play, this movie to me did not seem like a tragedy, it looked more like a black comedy. The modernization of the play didn't work well here, and as a result, a lot of scenes that were meant to be dramatic came off as laughable. Don't get me wrong, Baz Luhrmann's directing was competent, his heart was in the right place, but ultimately, his efforts ended up being a big disappointment. The movie could have been good, but it was sunk down by some ridiculous qualities, such as the guns being named after swords. One gem Fetch me my longsword. Cue a shotgun. Need a long sword? Bring out the shotgun.The cast was good, but most of them had a tendency to overact, particularly (and I really hate to say this), Leonardo DiCaprio and Harold Perrineau. A notable example of this would be in the scene where Romeo loses it a Tybalt before he kills him. DiCaprio's overacting in this scene was painful, and he was screaming so loudly, that I almost couldn't tell what he was saying. Whoa, calm down, go take some anger management courses. Claire Danes is also talented, but here, she was wasted and almost unbearable. Her crying sounded forced, and she acted really bratty and would break down if something didn't go her way. Anybody can do something like that. Thankfully, Danes would go on to better things, like Stardust.On a more positive note, Paul Sorvino gives a good performance as Juliet's father. Well that makes sense, as Paul Sorvino is usually great in just about any movie that he's in. Brian Dennehy also did good work, playing Romeo's father. Pete Postlethwaite was good as Father Laurence. Basically, most of the cast did good. However, others, such as DiCaprio and Danes didn't do good. I won't hold it against them, as they have certainly made much better movies than this one, but I can say that they certainly did not know how to do a good job in this movie. The way they played the titular characters, you almost wanted them to die.Like I mentioned, this movie was more like a black comedy than a tragedy. As most people who have seen or read the play know, Romeo dies before Juliet wakes up. In this movie, she wakes up just as Romeo drinks the poison. She stares at him for a few seconds before he just downs in. Afterwards, it was supposed to be tearjerking, but it was rendered laughable by Danes' terrible crying. Also, in this movie, Romeo is more headstrong than he was in the play. Whenever he got angry, he flew off the handle, and the way he did it, you would probably want to have him committed. And on top of all of that, it was laughable, as while Romeo could be a little headstrong in the play, he wasn't nearly as much as the one in this movie.All in all, while this movie is not one of the worst movies that I have ever seen, it was certainly a letdown as far as movies are concerned. Considering all of the big name people in this movie, I was expecting it to be at least a little entertaining, I mean that I wasn't expecting Citizen Kane, but I was expecting something to be at least a little entertaining. It was entertaining, but more as a black comedy than as a tragedy. If you do decide to watch this movie, then I would recommend that you definitely keep an open mind about this movie. Or a better idea, watch the 1968 version of Romeo and Juliet, as that movie is definitely a better film.3\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"4 March 2015","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Shakespeare's famous play is updated to the hip modern suburb of Verona still retaining its original dialogue.I'm sorry if what I am going to say offends anybody, but I simply did not like this movie at all.

This is a movie for anyone who knows that wasn't just a scare, it was the truth, Satanic Ritual Abuse cults existed then, they had for a while, and they still do now. Earl Partridge is the patriarch of one such cult, which is focused around the child game-show circuit, used as a cover to sort through children and pick out the ones most ripe for SRA. This movie shows the effects of SRA over time, both on the victims and the perpetrators. Organized rape-crime is NOT okay, especially when it's done in the name of Satan. Tom Cruise knows it, John Cusack knows it, Phillip Baker Hoffman knows it as well as Phillip Seymour Hall. When the scare was in the air... people said, that kind of organization, of chaos, it's too strange... it's not possible that this stuff is really going on, all those coincidences... are just that, coincidences. And that's what allowed the SRA cults to flourish, people's repression of the issues, victims repression of their memories, and the leaders repression of the truth, which got bottled up in their scraggly old bodies and turned into cancer, for all to see, and understand.

Earl Partridge is the patriarch of one such cult, which is focused around the child game-show circuit, used as a cover to sort through children and pick out the ones most ripe for SRA. This movie shows the effects of SRA over time, both on the victims and the perpetrators. Organized rape-crime is NOT okay, especially when it's done in the name of Satan. Tom Cruise knows it, John Cusack knows it, Phillip Baker Hoffman knows it as well as Phillip Seymour Hall. When the scare was in the air... people said, that kind of organization, of chaos, it's too strange... it's not possible that this stuff is really going on, all those coincidences... are just that, coincidences. And that's what allowed the SRA cults to flourish, people's repression of the issues, victims repression of their memories, and the leaders repression of the truth, which got bottled up in their scraggly old bodies and turned into cancer, for all to see, and understand. It's not going to stop until you wise up, as the film's spontaneous musical number points out. End SRA, kill death cults.Freemasons DO run the country, Stanley knows this and it scares him so bad he pisses his pants. But Stanley overcomes his fear and stands up to his Freemason father, who molests him, saying You can't rape me anymore, daddy, you can't rape me anymore. Powerful, urgent. Call to arms against rape and rape-crime. Freemasons think they can rape any little child they want because they own Fox News. Liberals think they can lick any kid's crotch with a blowtorch just because they own network television. Few movies have the courage to expose the power structure of America, and it's true catalyst, the rape of young boys, and the distribution of them as property. Sexual slavery is as rampant now as it ever has been, sublimated into the mainstream so people can't even notice it. DON'T rape children. End SRA.

Whenever an old man lures a young girl away, I always have a Stranger-Danger moment. The fortune cookies bit leaves me a bit cold. Once I get over that, the cute little girl is very compelling. I like most of the movie but then it takes a jab at child psychiatry that is both undeserved and unreasonable. It makes disbelieve to be some kind of evil. The movie itself makes the analogy to childhood imaginary friends. I doubt psychiatrists were locking kids up for imaginary friends even back then. If they could make the case that she was harming herself or other people, that would make a whole lot more sense. This is simply picking a fight with nobody real.

Just as Jane's menacing of her sister has reached a fever pitch, she encounters a third-rate musician named Edwin Flagg (Victor Buono)who Jane petitions to help her get her career going again and decides that with her career on the fast track again, decides she must eliminate Blanche once and for all.This film is fascinating as we finally got to watch two legendary actresses, who had never worked together before and allegedly couldn't stand each other IRL, work together for the first time and legend has it that the ladies did not get along at all during filming, but if that's true, it only worked to the film's advantage, as the characters they play are enemies, sisters, but enemies nonetheless and if these two screen icons really hated each other, they were professional enough to make this bizarre story one of the most entertaining films of 1962.Bette Davis received her tenth Oscar nomination for her performance as Jane, a performance so off-the-wall and over the top that you can't help but be alternately terrified and amused by her. Davis pulled out all the stops to make this insane character work. Joan Crawford was also nominated for an equally effective performance in the less showy role as Blanche. Crawford infuses so much internal pain into the character of Blanche but never allows Blanche's character to fade into the woodwork opposite the outrageous Jane.Watching these two cinema legends work together was a such pleasure, especially under the guidance of a skilled director like Robert Aldrich. You can't help but be in awe in watching these two work together and be reminded of everything they have done for the art of cinema, especially when both Jane and Blanche are observed watching film clips of Davis and Crawford in some of their earlier work. The black and white photography is also very effective, adding even more creepiness to the bizarre proceedings. The film was remade for TV about 30 years later with Lynn and Vanessa Redgrave, but this is definitely a case of If it ain't broke, don't fix it.

As with all great films, many components come together to create a masterpiece; excellent screenplay, directing, cinematography and musical score to name but a few. However for me, the acting is what makes Silence the unforgettable experience that it is. Jodie Foster's portrayal of the young and inexperienced FBI agent instructed to investigate the actions of a serial killer is as flawless as acting can be, inspiring many later performances from actresses in similar roles, and providing the audience with a first person narrative to stabilise some of the more horror-centred segments of the film. Anthony Hopkins' performance as Hannibal Lecter is equally magnificent. Despite appearing in less than a quarter of the film. his combination of intensity, calculated calmness and slow-burning character development without ever truly revealing the character's true history or even motivations, the audience is presented with, in my opinion, one of the greatest psychopath film characters of all time, breaking stereotypes of violent and out-of-control villains and creating something far more terrifying.It is the lack of prolonged scenes of graphic violence, blood and torture that give Silence its edge over almost all other horror films. It is unassuming when watched for the first time, and slowly becomes increasingly fascinating, impossible to watch and not become totally immersed into this world which is, after all, the real purpose of fiction.

Stoners and users of the drug blotters have been quick to try and assimilate a plot thread to this assault on the senses, much like the victims of a blotter fear will attempt to correlate images in their head with scriptures from New Age books. But it's not there, this is a nonsense film, stripping sense down to it's purest form without context. What Mulholland Dr. communicates it communicates through symbolism, no matter where the plot takes these characters or what random actor has been assigned to the temporary role (all actors play various characters, with no logic or continuity). There is the blue box, which is a symbol for Naomi Watt's colon. There is the homeless man behind the diner, who is a symbol for lust. There is the cross-eyed man, who is a symbol for greed, and trying to get the black book. There is the color blue, which is a symbol for the mysteries. Mulholland Dr. has some of the finest acting yet. Naomi Watts is indelible. Linda Cardellini is sensatious. Justin Theroux, in his breakout performance, is trace acceptable, as the actor-boyfriend who may be leading a double life. The stand-out performance is Anne Miller as the landlord Lulu, who is secretly hiding a kangaroo in one of the garages. Small players are forced to do big things Billy Ray Cyrus gives the comic turn of a life-time as a pool cleaner who is a little too keen in the peen, if you know what I mean. Michael J. Anderson is back as a ruthless sex-trader, and Dan Hedaya makes an appearance alongside Angelo Badalamenti, Lynch's faithful composer, as twin mafioso looking for a new lease on life. Nothing short of terrestrial here, folks.And of all the talk about the film, what would it be without the best direction? This is Lynch's finest hour, before he went crazy with the digital camera and started filming his whole life like Steve-O, Lynch had one last outing with the classic film, and this is one of the finest examples of pretty movie that there ever has seen. Colors blue, red, green. Pretty actors, sets that look like a fancy Hollywood movie. Space technology, some gritty realism. There is so much style and variety in this film that if you took any random five minutes of the movie, you wouldn't be able to tell where it came from.I saw this film at Festival, I saw it on run, I have it on DVD and Blu-ray and I go see it whenever it's screening at the local theater. It's one of my favorite films, if I just want to escape into a world that has no meaning, random visuals and colors and space dwarfs and serial-killer madness, alien conspiracies, mish-mash of Hollywood themes. 10\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"4 March 2015","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" It's been called an extra-sensory film, the 2001 enigma Mulholand Dr. is classically regarded cinema of the highest order, made in retro-grade, incorporating the nihilistic techno-dread of the new millennium.

De Niro plays Travis Bickle, a slightly disturbed insomniac who gets himself a job driving a taxi because he cannot sleep and he basically has no life. We then watch as Travis' midnight to six sojourns throughout the violent underbelly of Manhattan and how his already questionable mentally instability cause him to become obsessed with murdering a political candidate and an equally strong obsession with a 12 year old prostitute who he decides it his responsibility to rescue from this life that he has decided for her she no longer wants to live. He also becomes obsessed with an icy blonde who works for the political candidate he wants to assassinate.Scorsese brilliantly recreates the seedy and often bone-chilling atmosphere of Manhattan after midnight, making Bickle's comfort in the atmosphere all the more unsettling, not to mention the atmosphere created by the few scenes that take place in Travis' apartment, a sparse place of convenience that contains a little more than a bed and some weights and the sparse equipment that Travis feels necessary to complete his mission. Sometimes watching Bickle at home is even more unsettling than when he is in the taxi, making the character equal parts creepy, fascinating and pathetic. It's sad to watch how socially inept Travis is when he gets the blonde (Cybill Shepherd) to agree to go see a movie with him for their first date and he actually takes her to a porno film, not having any idea how inappropriate this is for a date movie and his confused reaction to her walking out is almost as heartbreaking as it is pathetic.De Niro gives a powerhouse performance as Bickle, which galvanizes the screen and mention should also be made of Jodie Foster's Oscar nominated performance as Iris the hooker and Harvey Keitel as her pimp, who are centrally involved in the film's shockingly violent denouement. De Niro received a Best Actor nomination as did the film for Best Picture. Fans of Scorsese and De Niro probably consider this film their masterwork and deservedly so.

Here he simply becomes Stroszek just as Eva Mattes becomes Eva and Clemens Scheitz becomes Scheitz. Herzog transports them from Germany to America where Stroszek gets a dead-end job in the garage of Scheitz's nephew and Eva becomes a waitress, (in Berlin she turned tricks to earn the money for their trip and doesn't appear too anxious to give up that line of work).Nothing conventional happens but seldom on film has the mundane existence of ordinary people seemed so fascinating, (and Herzog's use of non-actors throughout only enhances this feeling of reality). Of course, these characters are misfits; they don't fit in and they lead lives of mostly unrelieved misery and this has lead to accusations that Herzog is nothing more than a misanthrope and that, at best, he patronizes his characters. His continual casting of actors like Bruno S and Klaus Kinski has lead to a kind of alienation though, in Herzog's case, madness, like beauty may be only in the eye of the beholder with Stroszek no more to be pitied than Cool Hand Luke. If Stroszek is a tragedy, it is a comic one and immediately identifiable as the work of its director you don't mistake a Herzog movie set in America as a Bob Rafelson movie.
