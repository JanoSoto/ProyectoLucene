Well, that was years ago. Since then, Peter had gone to the real world and grew up into Peter Banning, a middle aged attorney. He's got a wife and two kids and absolutely no knowledge of him being Peter Pan.          Then one day, Peter and his family flew to England to visit his grandmother in-law Wendy. The real Wendy from the story. She was to give a speech at the opening of the orphan hospital that night, so the kids, Jack and Maggie, were left alone. All of a sudden, someone or something burst in and captured them.                     Upon returning home, Peter, Wendy and wife Moira, notice the damage to the house and the kids missing. They also find a note that tells Peter to come and save his children and was signed by Captain James Hook; Peter got a visit from Tinkerbell that night, and of course had no idea who she was, but she flew him to Neverland. Once there, Peter got into run-ins with pirates and met the Lost Boys, who when he told them he was a lawyer, chased him away. But they soon learn of his predicament and train him to be a warrior. And at dinner, they eat courtesy of Peter's imagination.         Meanwhile, Captain Hook and his right-hand man Smee, pondered what to do about Peter. Hook got the idea to make his children love him. It doesn't work for Maggie, but Hook was able to get at Jack.         One afternoon, Peter regains his old memory and can fly like Peter Pan! So he rounded the Lost Boys together, they went aboard his ship to get Peter's kids back. Hook had dressed Jack in a suit like his. The original head of the Lost Boys, Rufio, tried to take on Hook himself and sadly failed, so it was time for a showdown between Peter and Hook. It resulted in Captain Hook never causing any trouble ever again. So Peter bid farewell to the Lost Boys and flew his kids home and as soon as he returned to the real world, he was a whole new man!        A very good movie. Robin Williams, of course, is good as Peter. Dustin Hoffman is great as Hook. What's good about Hoffman is whatever character he plays, he becomes. You know. So it's hard to believe that the same man who played Rain Man is playing Hook, you can barely tell them apart! Julia Roberts, Bob Hoskins and Maggie Smith are here too and good in their roles.

That is, to convey the horror of war, and the loss of innocence caused by war. This is indeed a very powerful message, which has to be expressed. However, most film makers, at this stage, see this as 'shooting fish in a barrel'. Even master Spielberg could not stretch beyond the 'horror of war' theme in the brilliantly shot Saving Private Ryan.But, not until Terence Malick, has anyone tried to reach deeper and darker into the effects of war. 'The Thin Red Line' showed us how (through the murder of another human being, and the fighting for a cause you really, deep down, don't understand), your soul can be lost.From the opening scene, where Private Witt (James Caviezel, in a star making role), plays with the doe-eyed innocent children of a village he has deserted to... through to the final scene where, upon leaving the Island of Guadalcanal, we see (heart-wrenchingly) the change that has happened to these innocent boys, we are shown how the effects of the past events can never be left behind, but will always be with them. But if you watch this movie with an open and alert mind, you will notice that, there has also been a change in you. You become fully aware of how lucky you are, to have not experienced war in your lifetime.Acting wise, this movie was unbelievably overlooked. Ben Chaplin's scene where he reads a letter from his wife (who occupies his every thought), just to read that she has left him for an Air Force officer, always makes my heart sink with pity, and fill with anger at the same time. What excellent directing, but even better acting!!! And why the performance of Nick Nolte was overlooked by the academy is also a mystery.Much was made of Steven Spielberg's directing of Saving Private Ryan (Indeed he picked up another gong), but all he did wad use a hand held camera and on over-exposed colour film...... mix that with the gory, panic-filled opening scene, and you've got some super stylish visuals. However, Malick was ingenious enough to use the effect of the battles on the surrounding wildlife (a confused & scared snake in the long grass, a bird dying at the feet of the fighting soldiers..... ), to show us the destructive horror of war, not just simple blood and guts, but the irredeemable damage caused by such senseless carnage.An outstanding achievement of a movie, which could be analyzed for an eternity, and which requires numerous viewings, to gather the full impact of it's message.10\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"31 July 2002","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":"  Since the release of the excellent 'The Big Red 1', every war movie has tried to do the same thing.

Contrary to what some people are gleaning from this film, there is a plot. It's very evident. The only problem is that it's not an interesting story. There are some scenes which are reminiscent of situational comedy and upscale humor, but they all fall short.

I even like Owen Wilson, and EVERYBODY hates him!There's a very big problem, though. One that you might even miss since it's sort of obscured by the various other drudgeries acting. This film was like my worst nightmare. It was as if the director sat down with the actors and said to them, Okay, here's the deal, you're all great actors capable of some superb performances. What I want you to do, though, is pretend that you're Tom Cruise. That's right; I don't want you to put any sort of emotion into your lines, try not to move too much, and overall just seem like you're disinterested in your role.

Its a solid piece of movie-making but is not profound or unforgettable or a masterpiece or anything like that.  Most of this will openly discuss important plot points\/characters, so beware..Most of the value I got from it came from Benicio Del Toro's performance as a man doing the right thing.  He's a silent hero, he's humble and just wants to be allowed to be the police officer he wants to be.  He's sacrificed money to do this work because he thinks its important.  As he explains, he wants to be able to watch kids in the park, playing baseball, in a safe environment.  That's all he wants and he knows the high price to be paid for that.  He's the good guy without the parade or the woman waiting in the doorway or the swell of music.  Benicio is terrific and supplies the movie with what little soul it has. Oscar voters did a good thing by awarding him his first Oscar.However, the rest was not as good.  I had a lot of problems with the Zeta-Jones\/Dennis Quaid\/Steven Bauer story.  Bauer did not go from zero to being dragged from his home, arrested for drug trafficking.  At some point, the FBI or the local police or SOMEONE would have had some kind of search warrant, and been in their house.  There would have been some sort of incident in their lives to indicate he's a heartless SOB.  Then, after he is arrested, she is in shock and pregnant to boot.  In no time at all, she's made contact with some of his 'business men' and is giving instructions to 'shoot him in the head'...are you kidding me?  While the babysitter reads 'Polly Wally Doodle', she's ordering assassinations to government witnesses??  Sorry, not buying it..The Michael Douglas story was not much better.  His daughter getting high with her friends is perfectly reasonable.  Seeing them sitting around doing coke seemed authentic, the drug talk all meaningless and fast and mostly just a way to use your jaw before it cracks off, or feels like it..then one of their group overdoses, and they dump him at the hospital (Literally! Was this a small homage to Dennis Quaids' character in Postcards from the Edge?  He at least brought Meryl Streep INTO the hospital, not dumped on the sidewalk like a sack of mail, and he didn't even KNOW her!) and get caught doing so.  Turns out Mom Amy Irving knew of her abuse, but didn't tell husband\/father Michael Douglas, who by the way just so happened to be named the new drug czar in the USA.  In no time, she is put into a rehab, escapes from that rehab, is turning tricks for a fix, steals her parents valuables and has to be rescued by Douglas.  Sorry, again..he'd have an army of cops shaking down every dealer within 700 miles, because he, of all the people ALIVE, could actually request and get that!!  So you see him driving 20mph down the ghetto streets, in his $45K mini-van, searching for his daughter.  Its possible he didn't want to create a media circus by inviting help, but since Mom, Dad & Daughter end up holding hands at an AA meeting, it didn't seem like he cared what everyone thought.

Oscar voters did a good thing by awarding him his first Oscar.However, the rest was not as good.  I had a lot of problems with the Zeta-Jones\/Dennis Quaid\/Steven Bauer story.  Bauer did not go from zero to being dragged from his home, arrested for drug trafficking.  At some point, the FBI or the local police or SOMEONE would have had some kind of search warrant, and been in their house.  There would have been some sort of incident in their lives to indicate he's a heartless SOB.  Then, after he is arrested, she is in shock and pregnant to boot.  In no time at all, she's made contact with some of his 'business men' and is giving instructions to 'shoot him in the head'...are you kidding me?  While the babysitter reads 'Polly Wally Doodle', she's ordering assassinations to government witnesses??  Sorry, not buying it..The Michael Douglas story was not much better.  His daughter getting high with her friends is perfectly reasonable.  Seeing them sitting around doing coke seemed authentic, the drug talk all meaningless and fast and mostly just a way to use your jaw before it cracks off, or feels like it..then one of their group overdoses, and they dump him at the hospital (Literally! Was this a small homage to Dennis Quaids' character in Postcards from the Edge?  He at least brought Meryl Streep INTO the hospital, not dumped on the sidewalk like a sack of mail, and he didn't even KNOW her!) and get caught doing so.  Turns out Mom Amy Irving knew of her abuse, but didn't tell husband\/father Michael Douglas, who by the way just so happened to be named the new drug czar in the USA.  In no time, she is put into a rehab, escapes from that rehab, is turning tricks for a fix, steals her parents valuables and has to be rescued by Douglas.  Sorry, again..he'd have an army of cops shaking down every dealer within 700 miles, because he, of all the people ALIVE, could actually request and get that!!  So you see him driving 20mph down the ghetto streets, in his $45K mini-van, searching for his daughter.  Its possible he didn't want to create a media circus by inviting help, but since Mom, Dad & Daughter end up holding hands at an AA meeting, it didn't seem like he cared what everyone thought. There were other inconsistencies\/awkward moments for me. In summary,  most of it rang pretty false.  In a year when the magnificent Requiem for a Dream was released, Traffic looks worse than it might have been.  6\/10.

Tom Hanks...the always incredible Tom Hanks...delivers a masterful performance as Michael `The Angel of Death' Sullivan.  The drastic change in mood from his other roles like the innocent Forrest Gump or commanding Jim Lovell led Hanks to, in my opinion, his strongest performance since winning best actor in `Gump.'  In fact, his acting ability was so astonishing that he needn't speak more than 80 lines in the entire film.  Hanks' eyes command each scene...whether it is rage, pity, bewilderment, or a vast expanse of emotions...in such a way that I constantly found myself wishing that Mendes' noir-type close-ups wouldn't pull away.  Jude Law (an amazing actor who should be at the very least nominated for his portrayal of Maguire) delivers.  That is all that I can say.  Like Hanks, Law has very few speaking lines.  His dark, disturbing performance as the media photographer both repulsed me and drew me into his character.  The subtleties of his acting (the slouch developed from hunching over the camera, the duck feet walking style caused by the same thing, the impatience drawn from his need to get a story quickly) make the character incredibly memorable, despite a rather short amount of screen time.  And of course, Paul Newman.  Really, I can't say anything about him.  He is amazing. (though true Newman fans will find far superior performances in `The Hustler,' and `The Sting')As I said earlier, the camera-work in this film is magnificent.  Mendes, like directors Michael Mann and Steven Sodderberg, optimizes foreground, middle ground, and background.  By doing so, Mendes creates a total space in which the film pays out.  Also, the complicated sets lead to fluid, but very difficult camera movements.  Mendes often pans the camera back and forth while zooming in and out to capture details within the set and capture the ability of the actors.  The one problem I have with the films aesthetics is the coloring.  Mendes and Hall crammed red into every scene in `American Beauty' and decided to do the same thing with green in `Perdition.'

Many critics have accused the film of having a weak, predictable plot.  This is true to some extent.  But what must be realized is that this film was based on a graphic novel...a nice term for a long comic book...and Mendes did far superior to what other directors may have done with the material he was given.  As for the predictability, as someone who loves movies and tries to guess the end after I see the trailer, `Perdition' was a film where I could guess each future scene almost in order.

Since `Titanic,' movies these days seem to think that a score must run the entire length of the picture.

Since `Titanic,' movies these days seem to think that a score must run the entire length of the picture.  In this case, Thomas Newman's score, while beautiful and fully capturing the moment (as in the audiences introduction to Maguire I loved this part!) simply played too long too often.  My other critique the narration.  While I liked the beginning narration because it gave me something more to the film than just words or even leaving me in the dark, I thought that the ending narration became too sappy and cliché for a film as dark as `Perdition.'  A simple fade would have sufficed, though that would remove the Hollywood ending (not that I would really mind).I would also recommend The Godfather;  L.A. Confidential;  Miller's Crossing;  Traffic;  From Hell****(for the cinematography. Note From Hell is a far more violent and disturbing film...I only recommend it with `Perdition' because of the cinematography...NOT for content)  ","genre":"Crime, Drama, Thriller"},{"date":"31 July 2002","score":"","review":"  If anyone wanted to know the definition of academy award performances; they can look no further than those given by Robert DeNiro and Cuba Gooding Jr. If someone wanted the definition of an academy award film; they can look no further than Men of Honor.

With his stage presence, talent, class, honesty and sophistication, Gooding rises to the top of his class and becomes one of the most bankable stars in Hollywood. Gooding's role as Carl Brashear is one of the most inspiring and uplifting performances I have ever come across on film. His screen presence, honesty and class add credibility to this film and to the portrayal of Carl Brashear. Utilizing incredible sensitivity, Gooding captures the spirit of his character with little effort and great success. It is with roles like Carl Brashear that will win him many academy awards and a bright future in film.Men of Honor is a beautifully crafted, well-acted masterpiece that will leave everyone with smiles on their faces. DeNiro and Gooding come together as one to make a movie, which is a true testament to the human spirit and courage.

Watching it for the third time, I sat through the whole movie smiling.  I still don't think it deserved an Oscar nomination, but let's face it--there are many other films that got nominated (and some that won) for an Oscar that deserved to a lot less.  The point is it's a funny movie with fine acting, which at the same time manages to be endearing and warm-hearted.  Sure, these characters swear like sailors and don't exude a conventional sweetness.  Yet we fall in love with them.  They're just a group of working-class lads struggling to put money in the bank.  And I think that's the glue that kept this film together--we love these characters.  This is not a filthy, mean-spirited comedy--and with a premise like this it certainly could've been tempted into that route.  At first, I felt the writer and director weren't using the premise to its full advantage.  When I first heard about this movie, I thought the premise was brilliant  a group of unattractive guys who decide to become strippers.  Sounds hilarious!  Well, to my surprise the whole wasn't about their dreams to become male strippers.  And now that I think of it, it worked better that way.  In comedy, you have to be careful not to fall too much in love with the premise, because then it'll become a one-joke comedy and it'll fall to pieces.  This is not a one-joke comedy.  The stripper thing merely sets up the film.  The story deals more with the friendship between these characters.  And there are some great moments of truth, including one touching scene where Mark Addy indirectly tells his wife that he's too fat and ugly to be a stripper, but she completely denies the idea.  The scene is not schmaltzy or melodramatic.  It seems very real and endearing.  Though these characters may not be as handsome or buff as the Chippendales dancers, they're not reduced to ugly caricatures.  We do laugh when Tom Wilkinson says that great line, You're too fat, you're too skinny and you're both f**kin' ugly, but we're laughing with them, rather than at them.
