The film also stars Georgia Hale, Mack Swain, Tom Murray, Henry Bergman, and Malcolm Waite.Chaplin stated several times that this was the film that he most wanted to be remembered for.The Tramp travels to the Yukon to take part in the Klondike Gold Rush. Bad weather strands him in a remote cabin with a prospector who has found a large gold deposit and an escaped fugitive, after which they part ways, with the prospector and the fugitive fighting over the prospector's claim, ending with the prospector receiving a blow to the head and the fugitive falling off a cliff to his death. The Tramp eventually finds himself in a gold rush town where he ultimately decides to give up prospecting.After taking a job looking after another prospector's cabin, he falls in love with a lonely saloon girl whom he mistakenly thinks has fallen in love with him. He soon finds himself waylaid by the prospector he met earlier, who has developed amnesia and needs the Tramp to help him find his claim by leading him back to the first cabin.This film is one of Chaplin's simplest, loveliest features; and despite its high comedy, it never strays far from Chaplin's keen grasp of loneliness.The blend of slapstick and pathos is seamless, although the cynicism of the final scene is still surprising. Chaplin's later films are quirkier and more personal, but this is quintessential Charlie, and unmissable.Also,it is a comedy with streaks of poetry, pathos, tenderness, linked with brusqueness and boisterousness.It also shows his talent for mixing slapstick with heartbreak like nobody else could. It's plotted in an episodic fashion, but each piece of the puzzle is also a memorable, entertaining bit in and of itself.It is definitely a distinct triumph for Charlie Chaplin from both the artistic and commercial standpoints, and is a picture certain to create a veritable riot at theater box offices.

Even though most of his films were complex and I didn't understand a lot of the big words the actors were using, I just always loved watching them. As a child, I wasn't into older movies. I loved the classic Disney movies, I loved the Universal monster movies, but anything else, I didn't care for. It wasn't until I was about 12 that I began getting into all the classics. This is when my obsession with Hitchcock films began, and continued for years to come. It's hard to pick a favorite film of his because he's made so many classics, but I'm going to ultimately say that North by Northwest is my favorite. Why? Well there are many reasons. First of all the characters are just classic Hitchcock. When I was a kid, I really looked up to Cary Grant's character. I love how he comes off as so smooth, yet so over his head. It's been said that Grant's performance had a great influence on the character, James Bond, and I'm not surprised. Cary Grant just steals the show here. Just the way he talks, and the way he handles things, you believe that something like this would happen to him. The villains are kind of cliché, but that's what makes them so great. And of course, there's Eva Marie Saint as the beautiful female lead. Hitchcock's female characters were always awesome, because on the surface, they just seemed like a pretty face, but as the films unravel, we find out there's a lot more to them. You never know what to expect with these women, and that's what makes them so addicting. The last thing I must mention about this movie is how big it is. Every Hitchcock film has a certain look to it. They're all visually appealing (which is one of the reasons I liked them so much as a kid). Vertigo has a surreal, dream like world. Rear Window has an enclosed, claustrophobic world. North by Northwest just has this grand scope. From the city, to the fields in the middle of nowhere, to Mount Rushmore, this film just has a grand look to it, and goes perfectly with its grand story. Like I said, North by Northwest is just a fun movie. With its great characters, great story, great comedy, great suspense, and great visuals, it feels just like a comic book. I think this is a movie that anyone can get into. If you've never seen a Hitchcock film, North by Northwest is a good place to start (it's what got me into Hitchcock).

","genre":"Adventure, Crime, Mystery"},{"date":"26 October 2012","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" There are movies which seem to sum up the spirit of an age, and Taxi Driver is probably the one which best captures the spirit of America during the post-Vietnam and post-Watergate Ford administration of the mid-seventies. The main character, Travis Bickle, a New York taxi driver, is also a former U.S. Marine; the film never explicitly states that he served in Vietnam, but seventies audiences would probably have inferred this from the date of his honourable discharge (1973). In the seventies New York was widely seen as a dirty, economically depressed, crime-ridden city, and this reflected in the film. Indeed, the state of America as a whole is little better. A Presidential candidate, Senator Charles Palantine, is campaigning in the city and, while he claims to offer a message of hope, his speeches paint a picture of a nation depressed by war, corruption, crime, unemployment and inflation.Travis is a strange, contradictory character. Unable to adapt to civilian life, he suffers from insomnia and depression, and has few friends. Most of his spare time is spent writing in his diary or watching pornographic films. He meets an attractive young woman named Betsy, one of Palantine's campaign volunteers, and persuades her to go out with him, but she dumps him when he takes her to see a blue movie on their second date. Despite his liking for pornography, however, he is something of a moralist, disgusted by the petty crime, drug addiction and prostitution that he witnesses on his journeys and becomes obsessed with the idea of doing something to clean the city up or to make himself famous. His first thought is to assassinate Palantine, not out of any political motive- he has no interest in Palantine's policies or politics in general- but to get revenge on Betsy for dumping him. He abandons this idea, however, when he realises that the senator's bodyguards suspect him, and forms a plan to rescue Iris, a twelve-year- old prostitute, from her pimp and from her life of vice. The Godfather Part II had made Robert De Niro one of the most exciting film stars of the seventies. Taxi Driver was the second film in his long collaboration with Martin Scorsese (the first was Mean Streets), and his spellbinding performance here is perhaps even better than Godfather II. Travis is not the hero of the film- this is a film without heroes- but its anti-hero. He is, ironically, hailed as a hero after he succeeds in freeing Iris in a violent shootout, but he could easily have become an assassin, reviled as another Lee Harvey Oswald. And yet, De Niro enables us, if not to sympathise with him, at least to understand his frustrations and the dark psychological compulsions which drive him. He is a man who has served his country honourably, yet who seems to have been abandoned by that country on his return to civilian life.The other remarkable performance in the film comes from Jodie Foster. Iris may be a victim, of her pimp and of the men who use her for sex, but in Foster's portrayal Iris is a girl desperately trying to pretend that she is not a victim, but rather a cool, sophisticated young woman capable of making her own moral choices. Foster was only 13, but here she gives a clear indication of the great actress she was to become in the late eighties and nineties. There are also good contributions from Harvey Keitel as the pimp and Cybill Shepherd as Betsy, a genteel middle-class girl who is first fascinated by Travis, then repelled by him. De Niro was nominated for a Best Actor Oscar, but lost to another great performance, Peter Finch's in Network. Bernard Herrmann should have won Best Musical Score for his melancholy, jazz-based music with its plangent saxophone which fits the film's mood perfectly. Like Finch's this would have been a posthumous Oscar, as this was Herrmann's last film score and he died shortly after completing it. In my view the film itself should have won the Best Picture award for 1976, but in the event it proved to be too controversial for the Academy, which often prefers the sentimental to the challenging. I could have understood Taxi Driver losing to something like Network or Don Siegel's The Shootist, both excellent films in their own right, but losing to Rocky&#x85;..? What really baffled me was that there was no Best Director nomination for Scorsese. Admittedly, he has never been a favourite of the Academy, but this is a superbly directed film. Scorsese is particularly skilled at finding memorable images, notably those of Travis's cab on its journeys through the steamy night-time city. (The film was shot during a summer heatwave). These scenes are dominated by images of dirt and corruption, contrasting with the tawdry glitter of the neon lights and images of water, in the form of rain, of sprays from the fire hydrants or what Roger Ebert described as stygian clouds of steam. Another remarkably effective sequence is the final shoot-out in which Travis takes on Iris's pimp and his associates. The film may have influenced Lawrence Kasdan's Body Heat from a few years later, another film set during a heatwave and which uses a jazz score reminiscent of Herrmann's. The intelligent and literate script was written by Paul Schrader, later to become a director in his own right; a number of Schrader's other films, such as American Gigolo have a self-centred loner as their main character.

The main character, Travis Bickle, a New York taxi driver, is also a former U.S. Marine; the film never explicitly states that he served in Vietnam, but seventies audiences would probably have inferred this from the date of his honourable discharge (1973). In the seventies New York was widely seen as a dirty, economically depressed, crime-ridden city, and this reflected in the film. Indeed, the state of America as a whole is little better. A Presidential candidate, Senator Charles Palantine, is campaigning in the city and, while he claims to offer a message of hope, his speeches paint a picture of a nation depressed by war, corruption, crime, unemployment and inflation.Travis is a strange, contradictory character. Unable to adapt to civilian life, he suffers from insomnia and depression, and has few friends. Most of his spare time is spent writing in his diary or watching pornographic films. He meets an attractive young woman named Betsy, one of Palantine's campaign volunteers, and persuades her to go out with him, but she dumps him when he takes her to see a blue movie on their second date. Despite his liking for pornography, however, he is something of a moralist, disgusted by the petty crime, drug addiction and prostitution that he witnesses on his journeys and becomes obsessed with the idea of doing something to clean the city up or to make himself famous. His first thought is to assassinate Palantine, not out of any political motive- he has no interest in Palantine's policies or politics in general- but to get revenge on Betsy for dumping him. He abandons this idea, however, when he realises that the senator's bodyguards suspect him, and forms a plan to rescue Iris, a twelve-year- old prostitute, from her pimp and from her life of vice. The Godfather Part II had made Robert De Niro one of the most exciting film stars of the seventies. Taxi Driver was the second film in his long collaboration with Martin Scorsese (the first was Mean Streets), and his spellbinding performance here is perhaps even better than Godfather II. Travis is not the hero of the film- this is a film without heroes- but its anti-hero. He is, ironically, hailed as a hero after he succeeds in freeing Iris in a violent shootout, but he could easily have become an assassin, reviled as another Lee Harvey Oswald. And yet, De Niro enables us, if not to sympathise with him, at least to understand his frustrations and the dark psychological compulsions which drive him. He is a man who has served his country honourably, yet who seems to have been abandoned by that country on his return to civilian life.The other remarkable performance in the film comes from Jodie Foster. Iris may be a victim, of her pimp and of the men who use her for sex, but in Foster's portrayal Iris is a girl desperately trying to pretend that she is not a victim, but rather a cool, sophisticated young woman capable of making her own moral choices. Foster was only 13, but here she gives a clear indication of the great actress she was to become in the late eighties and nineties. There are also good contributions from Harvey Keitel as the pimp and Cybill Shepherd as Betsy, a genteel middle-class girl who is first fascinated by Travis, then repelled by him. De Niro was nominated for a Best Actor Oscar, but lost to another great performance, Peter Finch's in Network. Bernard Herrmann should have won Best Musical Score for his melancholy, jazz-based music with its plangent saxophone which fits the film's mood perfectly. Like Finch's this would have been a posthumous Oscar, as this was Herrmann's last film score and he died shortly after completing it. In my view the film itself should have won the Best Picture award for 1976, but in the event it proved to be too controversial for the Academy, which often prefers the sentimental to the challenging. I could have understood Taxi Driver losing to something like Network or Don Siegel's The Shootist, both excellent films in their own right, but losing to Rocky&#x85;..?

Neighbors Roman and Minnie Castevet soon come nosing around to welcome the Woodhouses to the building; despite Rosemary's reservations about their eccentricity and the weird noises that she keeps hearing, Guy starts spending time with the Castevets. Shortly after Guy lands a plum Broadway role, Minnie starts showing up with homemade chocolate mousse for Rosemary. When Rosemary becomes pregnant after a mousse-provoked nightmare of being raped by a beast, the Castevets take a special interest in her welfare.

The story is well-written with a nice ending twist and has some brilliant atmospheric moments that would not only haunt you, but creep you out in the process. The music from James Newton Howard is great and fits really well for the emotional scenes in the film along with M. Night Shyamalan's solid directing which has a lot of focus with the tone of the movie. The pacing is brisk and it has some great character development especially the chemistry between Crowe and Cole. In fact, the acting is excellent. Bruce Willis did wonderful, Haley Jole Osment did such a compelling job as a frightened 10-year old, Toni Colette did fine as the boy's mother and Olivia Williams did great as Malcolm's wife.Overall, The Sixth Sense is a classic and it has been a long time since the quote I see dead people became so popular since the film's release at the late 90s. My advice to those who have not seen the movie go watch it before Halloween starts. It is that good!

The soap opera world musn't be ashamed of Soapdish. Its portrayal of TV divas, the craziness, the egos and the jealous among stars, all the rivalry and all the mess involving the behind the scenes of a soap opera is fairly and hilariously presented in the film that knows how present some realism of what happens in those shows. It's all about real drama recreating fictional drama and the crowds love them...as long it's on the screen with actors playing in both, the drama of their lives and the drama of the characters they play. Here we follow the many attempts of supporting player Montana Moorehead (Cathy Moriarty) in to convince TV producer David Barnes (Robert Downey Jr.) to find ways of replacing America's Sweetheart Celeste Talbert (Sally Field, in her most comical role since Punchlines) from the leading role of a huge hit that gained her several Daytime Awards. But those attempts keeps failing again and again. One of the latest involves bringing back to TV an old lover of Celeste (both on TV and in real life) that now is a decadent performer of Willy Loman on a poor theater, the charming Jeffrey Anderson (Kevin Kline) that now is on his way to finally resurrect his career. There's the show's writer (Whoopi Goldberg) who not only tries to help Celeste, her best friend, during her crisis, but also has to deal with the constant changes on her creation (The man's dead. He was decapitated, I checked. How am I supposed to bring him back on the show?).

There's some secrets involving her that are best to not present them here for obvious reasons. Confusion is set up and lots of laughs as well. With first rate humor, an energetically funny soundtrack composed of mambo themes by Alan Silvestri, Soapdish gives a curious and detailed look into the TV world, the people behind it, their lives and their personal dramas and how those gets easily intertwined yet it's a movie filled with laughs. And there's time for a sensitive moment when Whoopi's character cheers the mood of her friend who was in a complete wrecked mood. That moment, the shopping mall scene, is a good reminder that comedy not always must go for the laughters, thoughtful special sequences like those must be encouraged, they make the film memorable. Humor of best quality is reserved to absurdest parts like the one that involves the last chapter of the show broadcast live with the actors reading their lines from teleprompter (Jeffrey barely manages to read his already confuse lines) and often actors confuse the plot and the characters with their real self; or Barnes attempts to put his hands on Montana; the scene at the hotel with Celeste spying on Jeffrey has to be one of the best parts ever. Performances were amazing, the script was fabulous and very well written. It's quite an shock to understand why this hasn't got the bigger audience it deserves and the awards it should've gotten.

It follows a character theme with additional focus on the plot. Though all five theme elements are present, this story is told with a vision into the lives of a mob family and therefore takes on the character theme. Vito Corleone played by Marlon Brandon is the head of one of New York's five mob families. He lives with the old world style and the Italian tradition that family and business issues should never mingle. At his daughter Connie's (Talia Shire) wedding it is custom of the Godfather to take requests. This sets the scene for the ties that bind this family to power. Don Vito has three sons,Santino played by James Caan, Fredo played by John Cazale, and Michael played by Al Pacino. He has one adopted son Tom (Robert Duvall) which is his personal attorney and consilere(adviser). Each of these boys with the exception of Michael is learning the family business. Michael returns home from the military unsuspecting that he will take his role in the business after his father is gunned down by drug lord Virgil Sollozzo. In return for protection and political contacts Sollozzo offers the Godfather a reasonably large profit, but despite the advice of his boys he continues with his old world ways and denies the opportunity. Sollozzo, seeing that the next in line to run the family (Santino) found this to be a lucrative deal then orders the hit on Don Vito. This sparks the mob war of all the five families and the rise of the future Don.This film in many ways is reminiscent of Donnie Brasco due to its focus on the characters in a series of events. The motifs within this film open up to the central theme of the characters by showing their power and lack of empathy when settling a score. The color pallet was not vibrant which would have been risky since the tone of the movie is more dark and sinister. The fact that this is a movie made in the 1970's as compared to the film technology of today is of no issue because you are truly lost in the actions of the characters. This film is now and will forever be iconic. It shows a blend of chaos and calm and that not all books can be judged by the cover. The reputation of the characters in this film will always be illuminated in the eye of the viewer and it will be difficult for those who have watched this movie to take them out of the characters they portray. The Godfather is a must see and will continue to be a front runner in movie history.

At the time, it was an interesting experiment for the director, having been filmed on a low budget and in black & white. It introduced characters and scenes that became an enormous part of the popular culture and influenced a GREAT many films that followed.Based on the novel by Robert Bloch (itself inspired by the exploits of real-life madman Ed Gein), it manages one of the absolute best twists in plot to be committed to film, making us believe it's about secretary Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) and her impulsive theft of her boss' clients' money, only to jerk the rug out from under us in a now legendary shower sequence. Marion makes the fateful decision of seeking shelter in the way-out-of-the-way Bates Motel, run by peculiar young man Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins), a seemingly wimpy person who's dominated by his shrewish Mother.It's a testament to how powerful and endlessly entertaining Psycho is, that it can continue to enthral us no matter how many times we see it. Hitchcocks' murder set pieces are the kind you never forget, and they're made all the more so by the most infamous (and imitated) of all of Bernard Herrmanns' music scores. It really helps to drive the movie forward, and Hitch and company create some truly delicious atmosphere, especially when it comes to *that* house, looking sinister and foreboding up on its hill.

Perkins is just tremendous in the role of Norman, so tremendous that the role and performance would loom large for the rest of his life and career. Vera Miles is wonderfully feisty as Marions' sister, who'll stop at nothing to find her, while John Gavin makes for a stoic hero.

But while The Searchers is an epic quest for revenge and Red River is a sweeping cattle-drive drama, Rio Bravo is on a much more modest scale.This Western film directed by Howard Hawks and starring John Wayne, Dean Martin, and Ricky Nelson. The supporting cast includes Angie Dickinson, Walter Brennan, and Ward Bond. The script was written by Jules Furthman and Leigh Brackett, based on a short story by B.H. McCampbell.Presidio County Sheriff John T. Chance is holding Joe Burdette, a worthless, drunken thug, for the murder of an unarmed man in a fight in a saloon where the problem is that Joe is the brother of wealthy land baron Nathan Burdette, who owns a big chunk of the county and can buy all the hired guns he doesn't already have working for him. Burdette's men cut the town off to prevent Chance from getting Joe into more secure surroundings, and then the hired guns come in, waiting around for their chance to break him out of jail. Chance has to wait for the United States marshal to show up, in six days, his only help from Stumpy, a toothless, cantankerous old deputy with a bad leg who guards the jail, and Dude, his former deputy, who's spent the last two years stumbling around in a drunken stupor over a woman that left him. Chance's friend, trail boss Pat Wheeler, arrives at the outset of the siege and tries to help, offering the services of himself and his drovers as deputies, which Chance turns down, saying they're not professionals and would be too worried about their families to be good at anything except being targets for Burdette's men; but Chance does try to enlist the services of Wheeler's newest employee, a callow-looking young gunman named Colorado Ryan, who politely turns him down, saying he prefers to mind his own business. In the midst of all of this tension, Feathers, a dance hall entertainer, arrives in town and nearly gets locked up by Chance for cheating at cards, until he finds out that he was wrong and that she's not guilty this starts a verbal duel between the two of them that grows more sexually intense as the movie progresses and she finds herself in the middle of Chance's fight. Wheeler is murdered by one of Burgette's hired guns who is, in turn, killed by Dude in an intense confrontation in a saloon. Colorado throws in with Chance after his boss is killed and picks up some of the slack left by Dude, who isn't quite over his need for a drink or the shakes that come with trying to stop. Chance and Burdette keep raising the ante on each other, Chance, Dude, and Colorado killing enough of the rancher's men that he's got to double what he's paying to make it worth the risk, and the undertaker gets plenty of business from Burdette before the two sides arrive at a stalemate Burdette is holding Dude and will release him in exchange for Joe. This leads to the final, bloody confrontation between Chance and Burdette, where the wagons brought to town by the murdered Wheeler play an unexpected and essential role in tipping the balance.This most entertaining of movies also achieved some notoriety in the '90s when Quentin Tarantino revealed that he uses it as a litmus test for prospective girlfriends. Oh, and if the configuration of characters sounds familiar, it should Hawks remade Rio Bravo two more times. Added to that,a comic western that ambles through its two hours and 21 minutes, it always has time to pause for a joke, a song or banter among the characters.Despite its slickness, virility, occasional humor and, if it may be repeated, authentic professional approach, it is well-made but awfully familiar fare.But nevertheless,it happens to be one of the best Westerns ever made.
