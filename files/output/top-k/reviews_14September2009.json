Well, when the movie started up, I got the main concept right away and was immediately interested, which they were very satisfactory at material like that, by that I mean, they weren't trying so hard to get the point through of what they wanted you to understand, they just followed the expression, go with the flow and that definitely worked out for the unquestionable better for this movie!I immediately fell in love with Juliette Binoche's character Vianne, because they do an excellent job at establishing her character to where you really care for her and admire her, same for many of the other main and supporting characters like Josephine, Armande and Roux. This movie had amazing character structure which in the end benefited it greatly, because that is one of the things I look for in every movie, that they are able to introduce their characters with strong, effective personalities and dispositions, you understand what they are basically like right away, and magnificently all the actors and actresses were able to do that with their characters, as I have already stated and praised a couple of times; Juliette Binoche deserved an Oscar, and Carrie-Ann Moss, Johnny Depp, Lena Olin, Judi Dench, Alfed Molina etc. etc. all gave astoundingly award-worthy performances as well!Second of all, the plot is absolutely miraculous. I couldn't help but be so mesmerized and entranced by how wonderfully they were able to create this strange, but lovable atmosphere of these people, not wanting to accept change to their quiet and cardboard little town, but then something so simple as chocolate is able to turn all their perspectives on life around all at once, which is a great and true message The simplest things sometimes can make the biggest impact, and this movie definitely showed that and handled the idea incredibly well.I love this movie, and the whole time I was watching, I had never wanted to consume chocolate so much in my life! I truly think it is really something special when a movie can just make the audience want to go out and do something or want to cooperate and or feel what the characters are feeling, and I mean that in a good sense of course, because the whole time I was watching this movie, I just wanted to experience these amazing experiences that the characters were experiencing and I even felt jealousy come over me as they obtained these opportunities!This film certainly is nowhere near bad and or mediocre in any way! It is a masterpiece! One of the best films I have ever seen, actually, no lie there! I didn't find one flaw, but it's just I do think it's one of those films where I believe there are overall a few better movies than it, and by that I mean, while this movie is breathtakingly stunning in it's whole trial, there are movies that I, surprisingly, do enjoy more. Regardless, Chocolat is a fun, beautifully crafted, completely alluring work of art from start to finish, and by the end I was astonished at how fantastic this movie really turned out to be. I recommend to anyone who loves an enthralling plot that commingles with unforgettable performances behind unforgettable characters, non-stop entertainment and a little bit of a chocolaty sweet touch here and there...

I had not seen any of the Godfather pictures for over ten years, so very few images were etched in my mind and I could come to the pictures once again with a fresh perspective. The Godfather (1972) begins at a slow absorbing pace with a wedding scene seeming to go on forever. The opening monologue is gripping and gently draws you in to the underworld that is to be exposed. Marlon Brando as Don Vito Corleone commands the screen with ease and is truly convincing. The first real surprise is how miscast Diane Keaton is in the role of Kay Adams, Michael Corleone's girlfriend. Keaton is out of her depth. Her acting is poor and at odds with the authenticity of the rest of the cast. The diminutive Pachino set against the taller Keaton is another oddity, which takes away from Michael Corleone's stature. I found all of The Godfather to be compelling but for the scenes with Keaton, which felt weak and unconvincing. This picture does have a wonderful performance by Al Pachino and his skills as an actor are understated and never showy as he would later become. His best acting comes when he hugs his brothers goodbye before he leaves to take out his revenge.I also noticed some really poor continuity particularly when Santino 'Sonny' Corleone beats up his brother-in-law in a street. The punches are clearly seen to not connect and his kicks are pulled and theatrical. This scene takes away from the efforts at real and graphic violence, which up until this point had been convincing. The Godfather Part II (1974) starts with a distinctly different narrative style than its predecessor with flash-backs to the rise of Don Vito Corleone. These scenes are theatrical yet engaging. Once Vito Corleone played brilliantly by Robert De Niro begins his assent, the film takes on an alternate life of it's own. The scene with the repugnant Landlord being a highlight. Pachino's problems as the new head of the family run concurrently with the flashbacks but they have less power and focus particularly during his business in Cuba. The trials of Michael Corleone are the best sequences involving Pachino. Again Keaton is out of her depth. She has more of a subtle look than in the first instalment but her acting is only slightly better. The scenes in which she is involved are again the weakest of the picture. Godfather Part 3 (1990) is a disaster. Now, instead of one casting faux pas, Coppola gives us another with his own daughter playing Mary Corleone. This fatal error should have been corrected as early as the first screen test. Sophia is simply not convincing in the role and the cries of nepotism transcend the picture. Apart from the casting debacle, the script of Godfather Part III goes against the themes so well established in the first two movies. Rather than Michael Corleone becoming more desensitised or heartless, he becomes remorseful and tries to repent for his past bad deeds. The idea that Michael Corleone regards family as of the highest import rings hollow considering that he sanctioned the murder of his own brother. Part III would have been better if it showed the assent of his son Anthony Vito Corleone within the family business. Michael's blind love for his son does not allow him to see that his boy is malleable and disloyal. He hangs around with the wrong types, is reckless and arrogant, avoids education, possibly expelled for violence. There are more warning signs from trusted Corleone associates but they go unheeded by Michael. So the downfall of Michael Corleone is at the hands of his own son, who sells out his father and betrays him for power and control. Michael is assassinated and his son assumes he will now become the next head of the business but all along he has been played and so is brutally murdered. So ends the reign of the Corelone family. Part III as it stands, is so terrible that it is almost unwatchable. The final scene with Pachino as an old man is comic in the extreme. What a crying shame! What a ridiculous way to end what could have been the best trilogy in cinema history.

Once Vito Corleone played brilliantly by Robert De Niro begins his assent, the film takes on an alternate life of it's own. The scene with the repugnant Landlord being a highlight. Pachino's problems as the new head of the family run concurrently with the flashbacks but they have less power and focus particularly during his business in Cuba. The trials of Michael Corleone are the best sequences involving Pachino. Again Keaton is out of her depth. She has more of a subtle look than in the first instalment but her acting is only slightly better. The scenes in which she is involved are again the weakest of the picture. Godfather Part 3 (1990) is a disaster. Now, instead of one casting faux pas, Coppola gives us another with his own daughter playing Mary Corleone. This fatal error should have been corrected as early as the first screen test. Sophia is simply not convincing in the role and the cries of nepotism transcend the picture. Apart from the casting debacle, the script of Godfather Part III goes against the themes so well established in the first two movies. Rather than Michael Corleone becoming more desensitised or heartless, he becomes remorseful and tries to repent for his past bad deeds. The idea that Michael Corleone regards family as of the highest import rings hollow considering that he sanctioned the murder of his own brother. Part III would have been better if it showed the assent of his son Anthony Vito Corleone within the family business. Michael's blind love for his son does not allow him to see that his boy is malleable and disloyal. He hangs around with the wrong types, is reckless and arrogant, avoids education, possibly expelled for violence. There are more warning signs from trusted Corleone associates but they go unheeded by Michael. So the downfall of Michael Corleone is at the hands of his own son, who sells out his father and betrays him for power and control. Michael is assassinated and his son assumes he will now become the next head of the business but all along he has been played and so is brutally murdered. So ends the reign of the Corelone family. Part III as it stands, is so terrible that it is almost unwatchable. The final scene with Pachino as an old man is comic in the extreme. What a crying shame! What a ridiculous way to end what could have been the best trilogy in cinema history.

I had not seen any of the Godfather pictures for over ten years, so very few images were etched in my mind and I could come to the pictures once again with a fresh perspective.

The first real surprise is how miscast Diane Keaton is in the role of Kay Adams, Michael Corleone's girlfriend. Keaton is out of her depth. Her acting is poor and at odds with the authenticity of the rest of the cast. The diminutive Pachino set against the taller Keaton is another oddity, which takes away from Michael Corleone's stature. I found all of The Godfather to be compelling but for the scenes with Keaton, which felt weak and unconvincing. This picture does have a wonderful performance by Al Pachino and his skills as an actor are understated and never showy as he would later become. His best acting comes when he hugs his brothers goodbye before he leaves to take out his revenge.I also noticed some really poor continuity particularly when Santino 'Sonny' Corleone beats up his brother-in-law in a street.

Not surprisingly I couldn't really see what was going on and had to guess. As soon as I heard the scary music at the start I knew I wouldn't be able to handle it- it's the same feeling I got watching the Halloween episodes of Bugs Bunny, the ones where the scary green witch tries to eat him. Brrr, I'm getting spooky just thinking about it. The film seems to be about a crazy scientist whose children die in some sort of freak electrical accident, possibly involving a lighthouse. The scientist wants to bring his kids back from the dead and believes he can do this by taking the best body parts from each and stitching them together. There are various terrifying scenes of him lurking through graveyards and Undertaker's houses so that he can acquire all the extra parts he needs. Eventually he builds a son for himself but it still needs life. As everyone knows 300 millilitres of electricity (Stat!) blown into the heart and brain at the same time is enough to bring any living thing back from the dead- of course in real life this vary rarely happens. He does it and his son is reborn again. They are both crazy though, the creature doesn't know if he is one person or various considering all the different bits which make him up. Naturally he goes on a rampage and throws lots of other children into lakes with lawnmowers attached to them. This was never fully explained and (pardon the pun) struck me as a little strange. I don't want to talk anymore about this as it is too scary. I might watch it again when I'm thirty, as when you're 28 you shouldn't be watching scary movies like this; You should be watching films with explodings and boobs, and playing Guitar Heroes.Best Scene When the monster breaks into Strictly Come Dancing and does a foxtrot with Brucie before mauling Bruno to death.

They are joined by a stylish photographer, Elsa Martinelli, with whom the leader, Wayne, winds up. Two of the younger members, Kruger and Blain, compete for the affections of Michelle Girardon, the daughter of Wayne's former partner, but she winds up with the unprepossessing Red Buttons.We get the usual sense of male camaraderie, of professionals whose bonds exclude intruders from the outside. When Martinelli first appears on the scene, the men at first don't want her around, especially the slightly bitter Wayne. When she sits down to play a tune on the piano, Wayne tells her, as Cary Grant told Jean Arthur in Only Angles Have Wings some twenty-three years earlier, You'd better be good. Of course she is.The comedic misunderstandings are enjoyable, as they generally are in Hawks' movies. The best takes place when the men return from a celebration drunk and find the stranger, Martinelli, in Wayne's bed. Hawks invited the collaboration of his cast and crew in making up funny lines and bits of business, never hesitating later to take credit for all of them.The scenes involving animals are sometimes thrilling. That climactic chase of the rhino is a tongue biter. Here is this two-ton monstrosity with the head of a dinosaur, entangled in ropes, while men try to coax the maddened beast into a wooden container on the truck -- and Wayne is actually there, counting coups, leaping around and shoving its flanks. Not bad for a man his age (53) with only one lung.Other animal scenes are more cute than anything else. They mostly revolve around the three baby elephants that the gang adventitiously acquire. The little elephants imprint on Elsa Martinelli and follow her around wherever she goes. The sly tune that accompanies these scenes was written by Henry Mancini, who composed the slightly jazzy, somewhat gentle, and African-tinted score for the movie. If someone alone the lines of, say, Dmitri Tiompkin had done the score, it would have been an entirely different kind of movie, full of fire and bombast. Not a WORSE movie necessarily, just a different one.I don't know that the performances count for much in a leisurely paced comedy-adventure like this. Wayne and Hawks hadn't worked together that often but they always got along well and it shows. Hardy Kruger plays his role with deliberation as usual, as if he's always thinking two or three moves ahead in a chess game. Red Buttons is likable and there are times when it's possible to believe that he's actually in his role and not just being Red Buttons.The rest of the cast can't act or, if they can, it's impossible to tell because they're roles are so circumscribed. Gerard Blain was a heart throb in France at the time and it was thought his presence might boost the film's appeal in Europe, but the fact is that he's not given much to say or do, and he's so much shorter than the others that it's noticeable. The writing has its moments when it doesn't fit too. Michelle Girardon is supposed to have just emerged from her adolescent growth spurt and become a young lady, generating the attention of the young men, whereas she actually is pretty, tall, and rather bulky and should have begun attracting attention ten years earlier.All together, an enjoyable movie. The kids especially should get a kick out of it. As for the adventurous scenes of hunting down those wild animals, half-way through this second viewing, I found myself wondering why the hell they didn't stop tormenting these poor beasts.

I think it has a knock out premise concerning an evil alter ego that takes vengeance out on those who rubbed him out by sadistically attacking those behind his demise. The idea that this dark place, where an author finds the material forwarded to popular novels, manifests itself in human form, ticked off at the one he gave substantial good fortune, should be a story that appeals to the horror fans at large. I think it's a cerebral, twistedly inventive idea obviously pulled from King's own experience when he adopted his own alter ego, writing under a pseudonym.The plot focuses on a professor, Thad Beaumont, who writes novels under the alias of George Stark and as himself. Stark is the dark side of Thad Beaumont's personality, which creates a popular series of horror novels detailed in disturbing fashion. When a crook finds out about the connection, he attempts to squeeze Thad through blackmail, which leads to Thad's decision to, once and for all, bury Stark and the baggage that comes with him. George, however, doesn't like this, and he rises from the grave to pick off all of those who were involved in his execution and burial. Meanwhile, sparrows are starting to gather, prepared to take either Thad or George to the other side, as they are a type of tool used to carry away the soul who doesn't belong. That's essentially what it is, a fight for survival. George wants to assume Thad's position, so that he can live, not die. Thad understands the kind of beast he is, because, in essence, he gave birth to him.We later discover that a tumor, which his parents told him caused his severe headaches, was in actuality remains of a twin brother he didn't quite absorb during the fetal stage of development. The remains were removed and buried, so when Thad and a crew, hired for a specific magazine piece marking George's death, shoot a publicity shot of a fake tombstone with Stark's name on it, this will set forth the shocking events which leads to a series of razor slashings against everyone who had threatened to cast him away forever.One of Romero's more sophisticated mainstream films, didn't hit a chord with his fans, and, actually, many didn't particularly like it. It could've been the premise, considering a killer who basically formed from nothingness, and wishes to take over his master's role..that and how the sparrows become involved in the grand scheme of things.Good cast included Amy Madigan as his concerned, but headstrong wife, and Michael Rooker Castle Rock, Maine's sheriff. Julie Harris has an amusing supporting role as a professor of the occult who lends Thad a hand when he's searching for the truth regarding his murderous alter ego. I thought Timothy Hutton was quite effective in dual roles, even more so as the psychopath who enjoys cracking wise, dressed in black shirt, jeans, his hair slicked back, carrying a southern accent. The finale, with all the sparrows, I actually thought was effectively carried out, particularly how they tear apart a character. The story, which many might find really hard to swallow, works for me because it paints poor Thad in a corner due to how George relates to him in so many ways to the point that even when it's impossible for him to have committed murders, he's a suspect.

Fans welcomed the change from Timothy Dalton to Pierce Brosnan, and they vaulted this movie to the highest grossing Bond movie at that time. Brosnan made Bond more suave and sophisticated than Dalton's Bond, with a dash more humor, though less humor than Roger Moore's Bond. It helped that this movie featured non-stop action and a foe with malice toward England in his heart, and the ability to execute a nefarious plot. In the opening scenes of this movie we see a breath-taking stunt, as Bond, well his double actually, leaps off the side of a dam on a bungee cord. Bond is penetrating a secret Soviet chemical weapons facility. We learn that Bond is on this mission with Alec Trevelyan, Agent 006 (Sean Bean). Unfortunately it appears that Alec does not survive an encounter with General Arkady Ourumov (Gottfried John). After a daring escape involving multiple close calls, the movie forwards into the present to the Mediterranean. Bond encounters Xenia Onatopp (Famke Janssen), and she is behaving in a most unusual fashion. Of course, Bond may have been attracted to her because of her incredible beauty, but regardless of the reason, she has gained Bond's interest. We soon observe that Xenia is a most cruel person, and she is ruthless in stealing a super secret helicopter that is resistance to electromagnetic pulses, such as a nuclear weapon might cause. We now move to Severnaya, Russia, where the helicopter has been spotted by satellite. We have the benefit of going into Severnaya as General Ourumov and sadistic sidekick Onatopp enter the facility and demand an inspection of the Goldeneye system. It seems that during the cold war the Soviet Union had developed an electromagnetic pulse (EMP) weapon, Goldeneye, which was capable of wreaking all sorts of havoc on any electronic equipment in the weapon's aim. Unfortunately for the personnel of Severnaya, once General Ourumov obtains the control module he has Xenia eliminate the staff of Severnaya. However, one member of the staff, Natalya Simonova (Izabella Scorupco), has survived Xenia and the activation of the first of two Goldeneye satellites. M (Judi Dench) sends Bond to Russia to find out what is going on. Bond soon meets with former foe Valentin Zukovsky (Robbie Coltrane), who gives him some clues that might lead Bond to the information he seeks. As a side note, Minnie Driver has a brief role as Irina, Zukovsky's tone deaf mistress. While Bond has been tracking down Ourumov, Natalya has been tracking former Severnaya associate Boris Grishenko (Alan Cumming). After a surprised Bond encounters Alec, he awakes to the yells of Natalya, and quickly learns that they are in the cockpit of super secret helicopter, and missiles have been programmed to fire and destroy the helicopter. After a typically close call, Bond and Natalya soon end up in the hands of Ourumov and Alec once again. The ever-resourceful Bond escapes, of course, in one of the best chase scenes of all time. The action speeds onward to a hidden satellite dish, which looks remarkably like the observatory at Arecibo, Puerto Rico. Okay, I am kidding, it really is Arecibo, except when it is a model. The action intensifies toward the exciting conclusion that takes place under, around and on the huge radio telescope facility. This Bond movie is as good as you might think it is. We hungered for a new Bond film in the six years between the release of License to Kill in 1989, and the release of this film in 1995. The world had changed a lot in that time. The Soviet Union was gone, and the nature of Bond villains changed as well. As a point of trivia, this Bond marked the first time a Bond movie actually filmed in the former Soviet Union. You can tell the style of this movie a little by the nomination for Saturn Awards this movie received for Best Action\/Adventure Film and Best Actor by the Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy & Horror Films (USA). The movie was nominated for a couple of other awards, and won a BMI award for music and a Golden Screen award (Germany). Pierce Brosnan occasionally looks slightly uncomfortable as Bond, but he quickly makes Bond his own. By the end of the movie I was comfortable that Brosnan made a suitable James Bond, and was already looking forward to the next Bond film. I recommend this movie highly to fans of the James Bond series and for fans of action-adventure movies. This movie is a winner and a keeper. ","genre":null},{"date":"14 September 2009","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" James Bond changed for a fifth time with this, the 17th official Bond film, emulating the venerable Dr. Who once again. Fans welcomed the change from Timothy Dalton to Pierce Brosnan, and they vaulted this movie to the highest grossing Bond movie at that time. Brosnan made Bond more suave and sophisticated than Dalton's Bond, with a dash more humor, though less humor than Roger Moore's Bond. It helped that this movie featured non-stop action and a foe with malice toward England in his heart, and the ability to execute a nefarious plot. In the opening scenes of this movie we see a breath-taking stunt, as Bond, well his double actually, leaps off the side of a dam on a bungee cord. Bond is penetrating a secret Soviet chemical weapons facility. We learn that Bond is on this mission with Alec Trevelyan, Agent 006 (Sean Bean). Unfortunately it appears that Alec does not survive an encounter with General Arkady Ourumov (Gottfried John). After a daring escape involving multiple close calls, the movie forwards into the present to the Mediterranean. Bond encounters Xenia Onatopp (Famke Janssen), and she is behaving in a most unusual fashion. Of course, Bond may have been attracted to her because of her incredible beauty, but regardless of the reason, she has gained Bond's interest. We soon observe that Xenia is a most cruel person, and she is ruthless in stealing a super secret helicopter that is resistance to electromagnetic pulses, such as a nuclear weapon might cause. We now move to Severnaya, Russia, where the helicopter has been spotted by satellite. We have the benefit of going into Severnaya as General Ourumov and sadistic sidekick Onatopp enter the facility and demand an inspection of the Goldeneye system. It seems that during the cold war the Soviet Union had developed an electromagnetic pulse (EMP) weapon, Goldeneye, which was capable of wreaking all sorts of havoc on any electronic equipment in the weapon's aim. Unfortunately for the personnel of Severnaya, once General Ourumov obtains the control module he has Xenia eliminate the staff of Severnaya. However, one member of the staff, Natalya Simonova (Izabella Scorupco), has survived Xenia and the activation of the first of two Goldeneye satellites. M (Judi Dench) sends Bond to Russia to find out what is going on. Bond soon meets with former foe Valentin Zukovsky (Robbie Coltrane), who gives him some clues that might lead Bond to the information he seeks. As a side note, Minnie Driver has a brief role as Irina, Zukovsky's tone deaf mistress.

This is of course up to the individual because we don't all agree on this. Though we can agree on some things, including what movies we like and don't like, our opinions are our own and our ideas on what makes a film a classic aren't exactly the same. Some films considered to be classics by some may be considered overrated by others. Many horror films are thought of as classics, such as 'The Exorcist' and 'Halloween.' Though each of those films have their supporters, there are some who feel the opposite and give praise to other great horror films. For me one of these films is Stanley Kubrick's adaptation of Stephen King's 'The Shining.' A lot of people really like this film and would say it's one of or even the scariest movie they've ever seen. Some even call it their favorite and there's nothing wrong with that. But I just don't feel the same way, never have.Pros Fine job done by the cast. Stunning photography and scenery. Plus the hotel itself is gorgeous, outside and especially inside. Fantastic score that ranges from grand and dramatic to chilling. Some very haunting sequences and images. The film moves at a slow burn pace, which is perfect for this particular story. Some great tension-filled moments.Cons Many great horror films are deliberately paced, but here it's just too much. After a while it gets excruciating and almost mind-numbing.

In fact in both the acting and directing departments it's pretty solid. The problem really lies in the script, not that it's poorly written, but it could have used some more work.

Beetlejuice himself is a marker of insanity, his contrasts to the main characters are visible from a mile away.

Each character in this film has their own unique quirk, even the extras that appear in the afterlife. Many nameless characters are memorable just by their looks.With all of Burton's madness running amok, it's hard not to laugh or delight over the exquisite detail put into the films finer work. While the special effects may not wow, the stop motion is great and represents Burton's style in a very refined way, and the makeup is still impressive years later, especially the scene where Adam and Barbara are briefly resurrected.

Nick Conklin, a cop suspected of being corrupt, who's nevertheless given the assignment along with his partner of escorting a dangerous criminal to Japan. Unfortunately, upon their arrival, Conklin is tricked into letting the guy go, and the rest of the movie deals with his efforts to get him back into custody. In addition to Douglas, there were strong performances from Andy Garcia as his partner Charlie, and from Ken Takakura as Japanese officer Masahiro, who somewhat reluctantly helps track the criminal down.Unfortunately, the good performances were about all that was in evidence here. The basic premise of the story was weak. Regardless of how much his immediate superiors may have trusted him, I doubt that Conklin, under investigation by Internal Affairs, would have been given this assignment to begin with, so the movie had an unbelievable edge right off. The movie also fell into the trap that so many American movies fall into - Conklin arrives in Japan, loses the bad guy, and then becomes front and centre in the effort to find him, even though he has no business doing police work in Japan. True, the Japanese police made it clear that he was unwelcome, and they made him give up his gun - but he later got one anyway. He ends up as the hero (true, along with Masahiro) - even getting a medal from the same Japanese officer who originally disarmed him. In the same vein, the depiction of Japanese police struck me as less than flattering, and, of course, Masahiro only becomes a hero because he starts to act like an American cop. The movie also offered a look at the Japanese underworld that wasn't sufficiently developed, and for no discernible reason included Kate Capshaw in a totally meaningless role as an American woman who runs a nightclub in Osaka.This gets a 3\/10, only for the good acting.

In addition to Douglas, there were strong performances from Andy Garcia as his partner Charlie, and from Ken Takakura as Japanese officer Masahiro, who somewhat reluctantly helps track the criminal down.Unfortunately, the good performances were about all that was in evidence here. The basic premise of the story was weak. Regardless of how much his immediate superiors may have trusted him, I doubt that Conklin, under investigation by Internal Affairs, would have been given this assignment to begin with, so the movie had an unbelievable edge right off. The movie also fell into the trap that so many American movies fall into - Conklin arrives in Japan, loses the bad guy, and then becomes front and centre in the effort to find him, even though he has no business doing police work in Japan. True, the Japanese police made it clear that he was unwelcome, and they made him give up his gun - but he later got one anyway. He ends up as the hero (true, along with Masahiro) - even getting a medal from the same Japanese officer who originally disarmed him. In the same vein, the depiction of Japanese police struck me as less than flattering, and, of course, Masahiro only becomes a hero because he starts to act like an American cop. The movie also offered a look at the Japanese underworld that wasn't sufficiently developed, and for no discernible reason included Kate Capshaw in a totally meaningless role as an American woman who runs a nightclub in Osaka.This gets a 3\/10, only for the good acting.
