The dialogue in here was extremely hard to understand at times. Oh, you get the gist of things, but sometimes the dialogue may as well have been in Chinese. Chopper is in jail acting like the Big Man on Campus, and next he is getting stabbed by his friend Jimmy. Chopper just stands there and doesn't fight off the stabbings. What is going on? I thought it was a ploy to get him to the infirmary. Next up is a hearing of sorts. Next thing you know he is out of prison and going after people who he thinks did him wrong. He shoots some people and acts like a man out of control, then he becomes somewhat stable. Last scenes show him back in jail and apparently he writes about his life and becomes a famous writer in Australia. Choppy, choppy, choppy is all I can say. Okay, to be fair, maybe the book wasn't as choppy as this movie. Now, how much of all this is true and how much is made up we have no way of knowing, but we don't really care. At first when we see Chopper in jail and the bizarre language he uses, I briefly had the thought that this was going to be a comedy of sorts or a satire, but this was not any of those. There could have been some comedy when Chopper tries to get the police to let him be an informer so they would look the other way for his crimes. Those scenes with the cops could have been funny, but alas, they were not. There is no flow to any of this. We watch Chopper and cannot figure out what he is going to do next. Is this suspense? No. Apparently, the Editor of this didn't know what to do next either. Chopper doesn't commit any crimes except to Off or WOUND his&#x85;&#x85; let's call them associates, not friends. And, calling them associates appears to be too chummy. So really, what we have here is a man out of control, who writes about being out of control, becomes famous for that behavior and everyone says Great Job. I don't buy it. The acting by all is fairly good. Eric Bana does do a credible job as Chopper. He's the whole show but to be honest, it's fairly easy to act like a person out of control and some would call that excellent acting. I am not one of them. And, if you look closely at the scenes the cast was involved in, most characters are in mortal fear of their lives from Chopper and again, those are easy performances the way I think. Is this tension? I didn't feel any. Australian movies used to be very, very good (Picnic at Hanging Rock, Master and Commander come to mind) but somehow they seemed to have lost their way and have become almost non-existent and maybe have run their course.

This really doesn't have any connections to AN American WEREWOLF IN London outside this being nothing more than a remake but I even have a hard time calling it a remake because for the most part this film comes off as a romantic comedy about an American in Paris trying to get over his nerves to get the girl he likes. All of the werewolf stuff seems forced and it often times takes a back seat to some incredibly stupid comic bits. For the life of me I'll never understand why they went for as much comedy as they did. Not that I mind that because London worked both sides of the coin perfectly well and I think you can watch this film and see why the Landis movie is such a masterpiece because it was able to pull this off. This film, however, doesn't manage to get anything right and in the end it's just a boring mess with a lot more negative things than positive. The one positive thing is Delpy who turns in a nice performance even though you can't help but think she's way too good for this material. Scott, just off THAT THING YOU DO!, comes off with a decent performance but the screenplay really doesn't do him any justice. The rest of the supporting players get lost in all the mess and none of them get much to do. The biggest problem are the horrible CGI effects that are so cheap looking that many of them take place off camera. The effects we do see are incredibly bad, cheap and laughable.

I remember seeing this hit a couple times when it was originally released in theaters but it's been quite a while between viewings but I was pleasantly surprised to see how well the film held up. There are still many, many problems in the film but the main goal here was to be a showcase for Williams and it's certainly that. The highlights are certainly Williams going all out and delivering a marvelous performance not only as Mrs. Doubtfire but also as the father. I thought Williams did a very good job at handling the role of the struggling father even if the screenplay lets the film down with a few of these dramatic moments that I'll talk about later. Williams handles every situation wonderfully well but there's no doubt the real genius comes in the role of Doubtfire. The way he plays this character isn't simply him in a fat suit and make up but instead he really delivers a true performance and makes this character feel real and not just some put on. I think Williams perfectly nails this character so well that one could pass it off as a real English woman. He perfectly handles all the comedy scenes and that includes two sequences that rank as some of the best screwball moments of the decade. There are two sequences where he must go back and forth between the father role and that of Doubtfire and these scenes get the biggest laughs of the movie. This is especially true towards the end of the film when he has to spend time with the family as Doubtfire as well as impress a hopeful boss as the father. Field and Pierce Brosnan turn in fine supporting work but there's no question that the film belongs to Williams. I think there are a few major flaws with the film, which includes the biggest and that's the final twenty-minutes of the film when we enter some rather very dark moments including a very distasteful courtroom scene where Williams' character's mental issues are questioned. This was just way too dark for all the laughs that preceded it. The actual ending is one you'd expect but even it doesn't work out overly well.

There's also a surreal image of Doctor Pretorious feasting in a crypt and while there's absolutely no logic for this scene ( Unless he is clairvoyant and knew the monster was going to turn up ) it remains a striking and morbid image James Whale directs at a very good and brisk pace and with his  midget people  he brings a sense of wonder that would have had audiences gasping  How did he do that ?  but I don't think it's his masterwork , that would almost certainly THE INVISIBLE MAN from two years earlier , a film slightly more enjoyable due to its insane , dark humour along with jaw dropping special effects . The narrative itself is rather episodic and plot less and the mix of different accents grate slightly with Una O' Connor playing an irritating comic character but it's still an impressive film though over the year's has become over analyzed by people who should know better ","genre":"Drama, Horror, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"15 January 2010","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" 1999 James Bond franchise entry The World is Not Enough treads a fine line between espionage inspired pulp and dumb, guilty action flick. Its somewhat overwhelming narrative to do with double crosses, use of alias', terrorism, kidnap and estranged relationships is balanced somewhat effectively by director Michael Apted, who combines these elements with a number of action set pieces that aren't really interested in anything else but blowing something up. The film, a polished and reasonably well done thriller, sets this stall out from the very first frame when a break-neck exchange between the hero of the series and a Swiss banker transpires in the Spanish city of Bilbao. It sees the men banter furiously about something during the exchange of some money before having everything transpire into a punch-up-come-fight scene-plus-getaway.A similar mixture of dialogue, which plunges you head first into a confusing exchange all linked to a much bigger picture, plus chase infused action occurs again shortly afterwards when an unexpected explosion occurs at MI6 HQ and a boat chase down the River Thames occurs; a chase which submits to the desire to encompass not only the typical iconography of the water-side set The Houses of Parliment, Tower Bridge and The Millennium Dome; but even finds time to shoot off river to encompass a red bus. So very early on, the film sets out its stall; its desire to cater to a younger, more expectant crowd in terms of what it is they've come for as well as a more mature audience looking for narrative and character, two things Apted does well given the demands to incorporate into the two or so hours he's working within.The World is Not Enough sees Pierce Brosnan in his third of four outings as James Bond, the British spy of book and film fame, doing his usual globe trotting; women encountering & guns and gadgets utilising act. Bond's nemesis this time around is Renard (Carlyle), a nifty little villain who cannot feel pain and is a physical ticking time bomb of both rage and slow burning death, as a bullet lodged in his head slowly kills off his senses - although sight and sound are still incidentally prominent. An additional element arrives in the form of Elektra King (Marceau), the daughter of a very rich business tycoon whose industrial speciality is pumping oil through Western Asia. Elektra is recovering from a kidnap ordeal which she suffered at the hands of Renard. Without giving anything away, Marceau's ability to play two different sorts of roles is impressive.There's a lot more to the film's narrative than the previous entry, 1997's Tomorrow Never Dies, and that in turn aids in giving Bond a rougher, more hardened edge because of what transpires &#x96; something Brosnan puts across in an impressive manner as the screenplay compliments his aggression. Given this was the first Bond film produced after the release of Mike Myers' Bond spoof, the first Austin Powers film, I got the feeling the production team wanted to go for a little more than the prior entry's droll structure of episodic set pieces and Bond clichés, and they just about pull it off.This is most prominent when identifying the number of ideas the film actually has, none of which are sadly ever really fleshed out to a point of pure satisfaction. I think the fact that the item of oil acts as a means to get most of the characters to clash is somewhat interesting; as is the nature of the intimacy regarding two certain characters' relationship. Without giving too much away; two characters will engage in rather-a stripped down, borderline sado masochistic affair, in which self-harm and what one can truly 'feel' is the catalyst for its existence. The few scenes between the two that we are given evoke a sensual tone just as much as they evoke a violent, self-harm infused and jolting one; built on a prior record of captivity and mind-games between the two and further inflicted on the opposition. Let's be hounest, more scenes in which characters are lying on a four poster bed whilst running ice cubes down their body as thematic ideas of a sensual; sado-masochistic nature are played out is infinitely more interesting that flying snowmobiles crashing into trees and blowing up.But the film is not without faults; Denise Richards' female, scantily clad nuclear physician Christmas Jones is somewhat vile and acts solely as an obligatory love interest, nothing more &#x96; I acknowledge all of the criticism that's come before regarding it and agree. Looking at the film a number years on, it feels somewhat nostalgically stuck between the old guard and the newer guard, or what we've been getting in recent years. The elements of Judi Dench's female 'M' character and a physically scarred, sadistic villain are counter balanced with a colourful display of cinematography as well as some slapstick shenanigans in the form of the character of R (Cleese), Q branch's replacement for the character of Q (The long standing Desmond Llewelyn). Some ideas have been maintained, those of which were not present in decades ago entries, while others that bring to mind a more 'classical' image of a Bond movie have all but been banished in recent Daniel Craig additions. This is why The World is Not Enough feels stuck, not in a negative sense, wedged even; between two Bond aesthetics. Overall, however, it works.

Yes, epic.Toback's style is all over the place from start to finish. His camera reaches up high and is usually moving, even when there is absolutely no real reason to. The excess in the camera movement is also complimented (or not) by an over-written script, which is something that doesn't happen usually unless a writer, like Toback, doesn't know when to stop with his characters. He compensates by having them talk fast (that or his editor takes out the little catch-my-breath beats in a conversation), and while not as annoying as the camera movements in most scenes in the first half of the film, it's noticeable. It's a filmmaker reaching far, maybe too far, into a realm of personal expression and putting the story into a modern setting - check the Bach mixed with rap and rock for more of that.And yet it's hard to totally begrudge what Toback does get right here. When we're meant to take a lot of this seriously in the first half (the deep philosophical talk in Chesney's class about Kierkegard and Lichtenstein or that mob 'family' of caricatures), it's interesting but it never really works dramatically. But when Toback suddenly shifts the tone in the second half, when Allan takes the three cubes of LSD, it suddenly becomes a full-on comedy of errors and surprises. To be sure, some of the visual jokes and whacked-out faces that Allan sees could be attributed to the same style as Fear & Loathing in Las Vegas, it still works. Especially funny is how Allan just seems to slip out of the FBI's hands (watch the one really strong scene of cinematography, sound, and acting all combined in the FBI interrogation room), and a masterpiece of a cameo appearance from Al Franken (like Toback also former Harvard alum).It also helps with the comedy in the second half of the film that the acting, more or less, is pretty strong. Sarah Michelle Gellar actually gives one of her most convincing, well-rounded performances as a B-word whose intentions are not very well hidden but puffed up with rich-girl sass and sex appeal. Grenier also goes for broke as a guy with a good sense of himself, until he bugs out from the acid and runs all over town. Adams might be a little more of the one-note performance, the stable voice but not as intriguing as Gellar and Grenier in their roles. They're all put in a movie that is mixed up and has a lot to say about sex, drugs, life, living, betting, sports, and lots more.

The priest is talking about Kitty Genovese, who was stabbed to death in broad daylight, with plenty of witnesses, but no one did anything, not even call the cops. The priest's message is almost the same as the message throughout the entire movie. This is the idea that the indifference of good people is just as bad what the criminals are doing. The brothers take this to the extreme after they receive a message from God. This message tells them that they should kill the bad people in their city of Boston. By bad they mean the murderers, rapists, drug dealers, etc. that get out of jail on bail and continue back to their old ways. They start out with members of the Russian mob, and take out nine higher members of the mob. Their friend David Del Rocco, a.k.a. Rocco, a member of the Italian Mafia who has been ignored for years, decides that he wants to help them take out the mafia after he was set up and supposed to die. He is their informant of who people are, where they go, their habits, and any other information that may be useful. The brothers and Rocco, dubbed The Saints by the media, continue to kill all of the evil in the mafia. Meanwhile, FBI agent Paul Smecker, and three detectives from the Boston Police department are at the scenes of all of these murders. They are trying to figure out how they are all connected to one another since they are all mafia members that were murdered. When Smecker finally figures out who is killing these mafia members and their reasons for doing so, he believes in their cause, and even helps them find the safe house of the top leaders of the mafia. However when they get to the safe house to kill the mafia leaders, things go horribly wrong. There are different aspects of film in The Boondock Saints. First, are the literary aspects of the movie. In the beginning of the movie there is a narrator talking while the brothers pray. Also, throughout the movie, there are scenes in which Smecker narrates what happened earlier at the crime scene. Second, there are dramatic aspects when Connor is first taken by the Russian mob, when Rocco gets shot, and when Rocco goes crazy at his girlfriend over her cat. There are also aspects of the movie that are unique to a movie. These are cinematic aspects of a film. An example of cinematic aspects are the gunshot wounds that the Saints get when they are performing their deeds, as well as the few special effects that occur during the movie. Some of the special effects are when a character is shot, the blood splatter. Such as when Rocco shoots his girlfriend's cat, the blood is splattered all over the wall. The music picked for The Boondock Saints gives it an Irish feel. The opening scene is led with an Irish instrumental song as the main characters credits are on screen. The other music picked for during the fight scenes blends well with the battles. There is also a lot of music that sounds like it may come from church, since the brothers are supposed to be working from a message from God. There are a lot of Gothic style hymns and songs of lament after they just killed people. Since The Boondock Saints is a low budget film, there are not many special effects, but director Troy Duffy displays the gunfights well, as well as the many injuries that the characters gain throughout the movie. Duffy depicts how a few people do as much as they can for something that they believe in. The acting is also pretty good, as the character show many emotions throughout the movie. I would rate this movie an 8.5 out of 10 and would recommend this movie to anyone because of the great plot and action in The Boondock Saints.

The priest is talking about Kitty Genovese, who was stabbed to death in broad daylight, with plenty of witnesses, but no one did anything, not even call the cops. The priest's message is almost the same as the message throughout the entire movie. This is the idea that the indifference of good people is just as bad what the criminals are doing. The brothers take this to the extreme after they receive a message from God. This message tells them that they should kill the bad people in their city of Boston. By bad they mean the murderers, rapists, drug dealers, etc. that get out of jail on bail and continue back to their old ways. They start out with members of the Russian mob, and take out nine higher members of the mob. Their friend David Del Rocco, a.k.a. Rocco, a member of the Italian Mafia who has been ignored for years, decides that he wants to help them take out the mafia after he was set up and supposed to die. He is their informant of who people are, where they go, their habits, and any other information that may be useful. The brothers and Rocco, dubbed The Saints by the media, continue to kill all of the evil in the mafia. Meanwhile, FBI agent Paul Smecker, and three detectives from the Boston Police department are at the scenes of all of these murders.

His paranoid friend and neighbor Scheitz (Clemens Scheitz) has taken care of his apartment and his piano while he was imprisoned. On the next day, Stroszek plays accordion and glockenspiel on the streets to raise some money and when he arrives home, he finds Eva beaten and the two pimps humiliate him. The harassment continues and without any option, Stroszek, Eva and Scheitz decide to begin a new life in Wisconsin, where a relative of Scheitz lives. The trio of friends travels to the United States of America expecting to make money and accomplish the American Dream. Bruno works in a auto mechanic and Eva as a waitress in a diner, and they buy a prefabricated house despite the concern of Bruno with the installments.

The conclusion is open to interpretation and I believe that Stroszek shot himself. I do not understand the meaning of the dancing chicken; with regard to the frozen turkey, I am not sure whether it is a symbolism indicating that Stroszec wanted to return to his origins in Turkey since he is Turkish-German, or if it is Thanksgiving in USA at that moment and he ends alone without friends just with the turkey.

The rest of the day is going to be one embarrassment after another as she gets the unwanted attention of a nerd (Anthony Michael Hall) while the guy (Michael Schoeffling) she has a crush on finds out through a sex quiz she takes. I really wasn't sure what to expect from this 80s teen comedy but it turned out to be pretty good due in large part to the great cast and the nice screenplay. Once again Hughes does a wonderful job in terms of dialogue as it comes freshly out of the mouths of all the young actors who really do a nice job with it and help make this a minor little gem. I'm sure most people watching this film will be able to connect with at least one of the characters no matter if its the dork, the overlooked girl or the popular guy growing tired of the partying ways of high school. Hughes' screenplay allows each person their own personality instead of having everyone sound and act the same. That's the one thing I've noticed in these early films by Hughes but he clearly knows various groups of people and he brings them to life very well. This film did shock me in terms of some of its humor including the rather racist jokes aimed at the Chinese exchange student, Long Duk Dong. This racist humor will probably offend plenty but I don't think there was any cruelness meant by it and I must admit that I found actor Gedde Watanabe very funny in the role. Needless to say, Ringwald really does good in her role and she's easy believable throughout. Hall pretty much steals the film as The Geek as, again, you can't help but believe everything that happens to him. I found the rest of the supporting players, from the grandparents to the sister and parents, to be well acted and once again their dialogue makes them all their own characters.

The rest of the day is going to be one embarrassment after another as she gets the unwanted attention of a nerd (Anthony Michael Hall) while the guy (Michael Schoeffling) she has a crush on finds out through a sex quiz she takes. I really wasn't sure what to expect from this 80s teen comedy but it turned out to be pretty good due in large part to the great cast and the nice screenplay. Once again Hughes does a wonderful job in terms of dialogue as it comes freshly out of the mouths of all the young actors who really do a nice job with it and help make this a minor little gem. I'm sure most people watching this film will be able to connect with at least one of the characters no matter if its the dork, the overlooked girl or the popular guy growing tired of the partying ways of high school. Hughes' screenplay allows each person their own personality instead of having everyone sound and act the same. That's the one thing I've noticed in these early films by Hughes but he clearly knows various groups of people and he brings them to life very well. This film did shock me in terms of some of its humor including the rather racist jokes aimed at the Chinese exchange student, Long Duk Dong. This racist humor will probably offend plenty but I don't think there was any cruelness meant by it and I must admit that I found actor Gedde Watanabe very funny in the role. Needless to say, Ringwald really does good in her role and she's easy believable throughout. Hall pretty much steals the film as The Geek as, again, you can't help but believe everything that happens to him. I found the rest of the supporting players, from the grandparents to the sister and parents, to be well acted and once again their dialogue makes them all their own characters.

It was a conflicted that showed the weakness of the UN, and took time for the West to get involved. Sarajevo itself became a war zone the centre because a no-mans land.Welcome to Sarajevo starts in the early days of the Bosnian war in 1992. Sarajevo is besieged by the Serbian forces and Bosnians are being rounded up to locked up or killed. An ITN reporter Michael Henderson (Stephen Dillane) is assigned to cover the war-zone. Sarajevo is a place where snipers are hunting on the roof-tops and shooting people who dare cross the streets including children and journalists. In the city Michael befriends Flynn (Woody Harrelson), a American journalist who has a seemingly uncaring attitude, but is really interested about the people. Michael ends up reporting about an orphanage and the children on the frontline. He becomes very involved with the story, reporting on it every night and start a campaign to get governments involves. When a Children's Charities is able to evacuate some children and babies to relatives abroad and in Italy Michael becomes involved. He ends up taking a care of one nine year old girl, Emira (Emira Nusevic), who ends up living with his family based in London.This film is based on a true story, with some names and events changed to moral and dramatic reasons. But the issues of the film is the same. Michael Henderson was bit like Oscar Schlinder, an ordinary person thrown into a extraordinary circumstances. But the twist is as a journalist he was not meant to get too involved, but he broke that golden rule of journalism. It is a film about the ethics of journalism and when someone should get involved with the issues there are reporting. The film is also about the war, and random killings that happened in the conflict. Civilians were hurt and killed and non-Serbs were rounded up. Serbia has always seen itself as a nation that had a right in nations like Bosnia and Crotia, and wanting to ensure power for the Serbian minorities. Serbia has often been a power broker in the region since World War I. Sarajevo itself was a shell of a city, with it being a live and death struggle. Electricity cuts are normal, and water supplies are short. But some people still try and make a go of it in the city until the fighting increases. The film is also about the inaction of the UN. They were late getting involved, and even the troops there didn't do much at first. The West were reluctant to get involving, fearing that it would be a propaganda coup for the Serbs. This was not a good time for Western nations and the UN at this point in history.The acting in this film was excellent, as expected. No one let the film down. They was a fine tort script, preventing the film getting bogged down, and find direction by Michael Winterbottom. They are some shocking and surprise moments, giving the film a more edgy film, and the use of hand-held cameras added to the realist feel. There are some continuous shots which I live and good editing. The use of news footage was also fitting and well done, giving the audience some background information and showing the wider affects of the war with the international community. However, I think some of Winterbottom's music choices were ill-fitting. He used some classic pop song which felt out of context. It does sometimes work, like in Vietnam war film, but that is normally to show the sixties setting and because the films have a longer timeline.However, this is a worthy film about an important war. If you like this then I also recommend Hotel Rwanda and Shooting Dogs are essential viewing.

It's because this film encompasses more of his life than any other film so far as I've seen.I don't think any historical character even those out of the Bible have ever gotten better and more varied treatment with name stars playing the character. Most Earp films do center around the shootout at the OK Corral in Tombstone. There are some others like Wichita where Joel McCrea plays Wyatt Earp and the action centers around his first job as a marshal in Wichita. There are others like Hour Of The Gun where James Garner plays Earp and the action centers with the aftermath of the events at the OK Corral. A lot of that film is incorporated here. Garner played Earp again in Sunset which takes a look at Earp in the Roaring Twenties as a senior citizen in Hollywood. Wyatt was one tough dude in that one.But Wyatt Earp as produced and starring Kevin Costner takes a long view of Earp from his childhood with an abolitionist family in Illinois with Gene Hackman as his father. The action goes to a coda where we see Costner and Joanna Going as his common-law wife as a middle-aged couple at the turn of the last century. Costner plays Earp as an upright man, but one who will not hesitate to back up his play with whatever is at hand. In one of his first encounters with a bad man, he nails him with a thrown wooden billiard ball. It's almost like they were using the same acting coach, but Dennis Quaid in this film and Val Kilmer in Tombstone which came out roughly the same time turn in virtually identical performances as the murderous and tubercular Doc Holiday. You could transplant each other in the different film and not notice the difference. Here Quaid has around him Isabella Rosellini as Holiday's slattern mistress Big Nose Kate. The standard for that role was created in John Sturges's Gunfight At The OK Corral with Jo Van Fleet being abused and nursing Kirk Douglas as Holiday.One performance in this film that set a standard in terms of how close to reality the character was is that of Jeff Fahey as Ike Clanton. By all accounts this one got it right, Clanton was a cowardly bully who usually let others do his fighting for him. He ran out on his pals at the OK Corral including brother Billy Clanton.

I saw some of it at least twice during my high school years, but the first time I saw the entire film was in 2005 (shortly after finishing high school), and from what I remember, I was a little disappointed. Maybe I didn't exactly think it was bad, but it certainly didn't meet my expectations. After over four years, I finally watched it from start to finish a second time, and as I had hoped, it was definitely better this time. There were some things I couldn't remember from my first viewing, especially towards the end, but as well as being better, my second viewing was also more memorable.Every five thousand years, a great evil comes and threatens all life in the Universe! Four stones (representing fire, air, water, and earth) and a living being known as the Fifth Element together make the only weapon that can stop it! In 1914, three hundred years before this great evil is to return, an extraterrestrial group called the Mondoshawan come to Earth to take the Elements from an ancient tomb in Egypt and keep them safe. Three hundred years later, in an era of flying cars, the Mondoshawan attempt to return to Earth, but are killed by evil aliens called Mangalores! Scientists find a portion of the Fifth Element in the remains of the Mondoshawan ship, and use a machine to recreate it. It comes to life in the form of a human female named Leeloo, who escapes from the laboratory and falls into the backseat of a taxi driven by Korben Dallas, a former military man. He takes her to a priest named Father Vito Cornelius, who knows just who\/what she is after he sees the mark on her arm! The priest is searching for the other four elements, but so is the evil Zorg, who has different plans for them! I may not have found this movie very suspenseful the first time I watched it all, but the same cannot be said about the second time. I found a lot of it suspenseful this time, with all the action, starting during the opening sequence, set in 1914 Egypt, and continuing for much of the rest of the film, set in the 23rd century. To add to the quality of The Fifth Element, there are good performances here from Bruce Willis, Milla Jovovich, Ian Holm, Gary Oldman, etc. The film also has some humour, sometimes funny and sometimes not so much. The bada boom part is pretty annoying, and Chris Tucker as Ruby Rhod isn't a very good comic relief. I may not have found him nearly as annoying as some people probably have, but his antics can be pretty lame. However, there is some good humour, with Zorg (Oldman's character, a better comic relief), Korben hiding military personnel in his fridge, etc. I tend to really like the visuals in these modern sci-fi blockbusters, with the sets and special effects, and the visuals here are no exception. Finally, towards the end, there are some fairly moving scenes.This is not a film I've ever been able to describe as a masterpiece, but after watching it twice, I think it deserves a lot of praise. I'm not sure why I wasn't that impressed the first time. Maybe I wasn't exactly in the right mood, or maybe I had to see it again in order to understand its popularity. Well, whatever the reason was, it definitely improved with a second viewing, as some movies do, and I think I now understand why it's so popular, even if I don't like it as much as many others clearly do. Sure, some of the humour doesn't work (some Chris Tucker gags included), the romance between Korben and Leeloo is sometimes a little cheesy, and those may not be the only two flaws, but apart from that, there's not much I can criticize The Fifth Element for. If you like a good sci-fi adventure, many would obviously agree that this one is worth a look.

I may not have found this movie very suspenseful the first time I watched it all, but the same cannot be said about the second time. I found a lot of it suspenseful this time, with all the action, starting during the opening sequence, set in 1914 Egypt, and continuing for much of the rest of the film, set in the 23rd century. To add to the quality of The Fifth Element, there are good performances here from Bruce Willis, Milla Jovovich, Ian Holm, Gary Oldman, etc. The film also has some humour, sometimes funny and sometimes not so much. The bada boom part is pretty annoying, and Chris Tucker as Ruby Rhod isn't a very good comic relief. I may not have found him nearly as annoying as some people probably have, but his antics can be pretty lame. However, there is some good humour, with Zorg (Oldman's character, a better comic relief), Korben hiding military personnel in his fridge, etc. I tend to really like the visuals in these modern sci-fi blockbusters, with the sets and special effects, and the visuals here are no exception. Finally, towards the end, there are some fairly moving scenes.This is not a film I've ever been able to describe as a masterpiece, but after watching it twice, I think it deserves a lot of praise. I'm not sure why I wasn't that impressed the first time. Maybe I wasn't exactly in the right mood, or maybe I had to see it again in order to understand its popularity. Well, whatever the reason was, it definitely improved with a second viewing, as some movies do, and I think I now understand why it's so popular, even if I don't like it as much as many others clearly do. Sure, some of the humour doesn't work (some Chris Tucker gags included), the romance between Korben and Leeloo is sometimes a little cheesy, and those may not be the only two flaws, but apart from that, there's not much I can criticize The Fifth Element for. If you like a good sci-fi adventure, many would obviously agree that this one is worth a look.

I saw some of it at least twice during my high school years, but the first time I saw the entire film was in 2005 (shortly after finishing high school), and from what I remember, I was a little disappointed. Maybe I didn't exactly think it was bad, but it certainly didn't meet my expectations. After over four years, I finally watched it from start to finish a second time, and as I had hoped, it was definitely better this time. There were some things I couldn't remember from my first viewing, especially towards the end, but as well as being better, my second viewing was also more memorable.Every five thousand years, a great evil comes and threatens all life in the Universe! Four stones (representing fire, air, water, and earth) and a living being known as the Fifth Element together make the only weapon that can stop it! In 1914, three hundred years before this great evil is to return, an extraterrestrial group called the Mondoshawan come to Earth to take the Elements from an ancient tomb in Egypt and keep them safe. Three hundred years later, in an era of flying cars, the Mondoshawan attempt to return to Earth, but are killed by evil aliens called Mangalores! Scientists find a portion of the Fifth Element in the remains of the Mondoshawan ship, and use a machine to recreate it. It comes to life in the form of a human female named Leeloo, who escapes from the laboratory and falls into the backseat of a taxi driven by Korben Dallas, a former military man. He takes her to a priest named Father Vito Cornelius, who knows just who\/what she is after he sees the mark on her arm! The priest is searching for the other four elements, but so is the evil Zorg, who has different plans for them!
