Nominated for Best Actor for 1988 (an Oscar he should have won really), Tom Hanks gives a brilliant performance in this fabulous fish out of water story. 12 year old Josh Baskin is a typical adolescent, obsessed with girls and shirks responsibility whenever he can. One night, when he goes to a carnival with his parents, he is embarrassed in front of a girl he has a crush on by being excluded from a fairground ride because he is too short.He comes across a machine called Zoltar at the carnival, where it apparently grants wishes. Josh makes a simple request, I wish I were big. The next morning, when Josh wakes up, he finds to his amazement he has become a 35 year old man (Tom Hanks).With the carnival gone, and the Zoltar machine along with it, Josh must frantically try to track it down. But his own mother doesn't even recognise him, and assumes he kidnapped her son. The only person he can turn to is Billy, his best friend, (Jared Rushton, looking like a live action version of Bart Simpson). After convincing him it is Josh, the two head to New York, where Josh gets a job at a toy company as a computer operator. Until they can get an idea of where the Zoltar machine is, and Josh can wish himself back to being a child.Josh quickly manages to become an executive at the company after getting on the good side of the boss MacMillan (Robert Loggia) in a charming scene at the mall playing on a giant keyboard. His innocence and wisdom allow him to predict what toys children want, much to the anger of one of his co-workers Paul (John Heard). It also means one of the female executives Susan (Elizabeth Perkins) falls in love with him, because she is attracted to his innocence.Tom Hanks is perfectly suited to the role, because he brings with it a goofy charm that shows how Josh can't properly fathom the adult world even though he looks like an adult. He just sees the world through a child's eye, and tries to accept things in the best way he can. The film has many memorable moments (especially the keyboard scene) but Tom Hanks is what makes those scenes memorable. His gawky enthusiasm is greatly accessible, and rich in subtlety and nuance. He's got great chemistry with Elizabeth Perkins, and its funny because he can't quite grasp at first what it is she wants from their relationship. One of the funniest exchanges is when they go to his apartment which looks like a gigantic teenager's bedroom(Susan) I mean I like you, and I want to spend the night with you. (Josh) Do you mean sleep over? (Susan) Well, yeah. (Josh) OK. But I get to be on top.The fact he is talking about a bunk bed and their wires are seriously crossed is what makes that scene so funny. In some respects, the adult world has some connotations with the world Josh is used to. Paul is like a bully, and antagonises Josh every chance he gets. The scene where they're playing racquet ball is a prime example.Big arrayed a quite impressive number of up and coming talents, both in front of and behind the camera. As well as Penny Marshall in the directors chair, the screenplay is overseen by Anne Spielberg, sister of...well I think you know who, and Gary Ross, future director of the extremely underrated Pleasantville. Handling the cinematography is Barry Sonnenfeld, before he directed classics like Get Shorty and The Addams Family. Look out for future Simpsons writer James L. Brooks on the credits too!Wisely, the filmmakers steered clear of outright mawkishness and over sentimentality, and the audience isn't patronised by the material. There is something to appreciate no matter what age you are, although there are some scenes that may be unsuitable for young children, e.g. Josh's implied sex scene with Susan and one use of the F word.Big is still a lot of fun, and the ending is bittersweet when Josh must say goodbye to Susan.

But the re-release of William Peter Blatty's The Exorcist (1973) firmly proves that this is NOT such a movie. Now carrying the tag The Version You've Never Seen, the 27th anniversary version of William Friedkin's seminal film (with added footage and a new surround mix) is as horrifying and disturbing as ever -- and I mean that in a good way. While it is still best known for the taboos it broke (i.e. a possessed girl urinating in the living room, vomiting pea soup, and -- most infamously -- doing inappropriate things with a crucifix), the most powerful aspects of the film are in fact its compelling story and unforgettable characters. The story -- adapted by Blatty from his best-selling novel -- is essentially about a 12-year-old girl who begins to show strange behavior and ends up having an exorcism to remove the demon that is possessing her. But when you consider the picture as a whole, this part of the plot is really rather minimal most of the film revolves around Father Karras (played indelibly by Jason Miller in his debut performance), a psychological counselor dealing with the guilt of his mother's sudden passing. When he is introduced to Chris MacNeill (Ellen Burstyn), he sees an opportunity for redemption in her possessed daughter Regan (Linda Blair in a role that determined -- and, in a way, ruined --  her acting career). Max Von Sydow and Lee J. Cobb play the other two principal parts -- respectively, a priest and a detective -- and in the end, all of the characters collide in a conclusion that still manages to shock and amaze us. And let us not forget Jack MacGowran (whose eerie death during the film's production is still the cause of speculation), who delivers his most memorable role as Burstyn's drunken friend. The Exorcist is one of those films that seems more and more perfect as time goes by the screenplay, the direction, the editing, and that haunting music ... it all adds up to what is quite easily one of the best American movies ever made. Friedkin (who was notorious for having treated the cast of the movie as cattle) manages to draw top-notch performances from each actor, creating a mood of dread and tension unparalleled since Roman Polanski's Rosemary's Baby. Every minor detail (keep your eyes peeled for the subliminal devil images) just makes it increasingly flawless, and it is made even moreso with its new additions the extra scenes (the most important one being Regan's spider-walk down the staircase) actually add something to the movie, giving the characters and story greater depth and development. But the greatest supplement is surely the remastered soundtrack, which is presented in 5.1 Dolby Digital EX, making the film even MORE intense than it was to begin with.

Henson's previous fantasy film, `The Dark Crystal,' was arguably the best one of the genre yet made at the time of its release, and this one brings in Terry Jones as writer and George Lucas as executive producer.  At the time, this congregation of talent must have been very exciting, but man, what a movie they came up with.The Henson touches are unmistakable--the design is staggeringly beautiful, the goblin mazeworld appealing and believable, and the dark philosophical edges thought-provoking and frightening.  The style at first suggests the Terry Gilliam of `Time Bandits,' but I was reminded even more of the fantasy\/horror Europes we've seen in Dario Argento's `Suspiria' (at times the score even sounded, appropriately enough, like Goblin) and Neil Jordan's `The Company of Wolves.'Unfortunately, the movie is never sure whether it's for very small children, slightly bigger children, teenagers, or grownups, and for every one good idea there are at least five dopey, witless gags.  `The Dark Crystal' had the courage to tackle this difficult genre with a Tolkien-like poker face, but Jones's screenplay is a grating, simpering bore--consistently silly without ever being funny.  Henson apparently didn't approve of the script, and the animosity between director and screenwriter makes for a nightmare of shifting tones.  We keep waiting for `Labyrinth' to get funny, but it never does.  Or we keep waiting for it to drop the schtick (Sarah's existential encounter with the Junk Lady, e.g., provides a glimpse of what the whole film might have been like), but it never does.  I have no idea how much involvement Lucas had (he's clearly in `Howard the Duck' and `Willow' mode here), but, sadly, Henson has to take the blame--after all, it was the notorious perfectionist himself who made the final call (in theory, anyway). And by the time we reach the chaotic, incomprehensible battle in the goblin city, you'll wonder how anyone involved could have greenlighted this rubbish in the first place.As for the acting, Jennifer Connelly has rarely been worse (and that's saying a mouthful); she pouts and shouts her way through her role as if she were a Muppet herself.  Bowie's certainly an exciting choice for Jareth, but he's another victim of the tonal seasickness, and his non-sequitur songs haven't dated well.  (And for decency's sake, couldn't they have given him some proper trousers?)  Hoggle is well-conceived, but Ludo is right out of `Sesame Street' and the faux-Elizabethan twit Sir Didymus is one of the most excruciating puppet characters of all time.  The Muppet extras are at their best when they're being surreal (the `Helping Hands' section comes to mind), but mostly they're just loud and violent and irritating.  It's like an episode of `The Muppet Show' minus the irony and satirical wit.Experienced in the right mindset, `Labyrinth' can make for some hilarious fun, of course.  It's got the same ratio of bad-to-good ideas, and the same insane puppet freakiness, as its infamous contemporary `Troll.'  It's got one horrible performance by a teen actress who went on to become a big star, and another by a noted wack-job rock star in a punk hairdo and an obscene outfit (and with plenty of awful songs).

The style at first suggests the Terry Gilliam of `Time Bandits,' but I was reminded even more of the fantasy\/horror Europes we've seen in Dario Argento's `Suspiria' (at times the score even sounded, appropriately enough, like Goblin) and Neil Jordan's `The Company of Wolves.'Unfortunately, the movie is never sure whether it's for very small children, slightly bigger children, teenagers, or grownups, and for every one good idea there are at least five dopey, witless gags.  `The Dark Crystal' had the courage to tackle this difficult genre with a Tolkien-like poker face, but Jones's screenplay is a grating, simpering bore--consistently silly without ever being funny.  Henson apparently didn't approve of the script, and the animosity between director and screenwriter makes for a nightmare of shifting tones.  We keep waiting for `Labyrinth' to get funny, but it never does.  Or we keep waiting for it to drop the schtick (Sarah's existential encounter with the Junk Lady, e.g., provides a glimpse of what the whole film might have been like), but it never does.  I have no idea how much involvement Lucas had (he's clearly in `Howard the Duck' and `Willow' mode here), but, sadly, Henson has to take the blame--after all, it was the notorious perfectionist himself who made the final call (in theory, anyway). And by the time we reach the chaotic, incomprehensible battle in the goblin city, you'll wonder how anyone involved could have greenlighted this rubbish in the first place.As for the acting, Jennifer Connelly has rarely been worse (and that's saying a mouthful); she pouts and shouts her way through her role as if she were a Muppet herself.  Bowie's certainly an exciting choice for Jareth, but he's another victim of the tonal seasickness, and his non-sequitur songs haven't dated well.  (And for decency's sake, couldn't they have given him some proper trousers?)  Hoggle is well-conceived, but Ludo is right out of `Sesame Street' and the faux-Elizabethan twit Sir Didymus is one of the most excruciating puppet characters of all time.  The Muppet extras are at their best when they're being surreal (the `Helping Hands' section comes to mind), but mostly they're just loud and violent and irritating.  It's like an episode of `The Muppet Show' minus the irony and satirical wit.Experienced in the right mindset, `Labyrinth' can make for some hilarious fun, of course.  It's got the same ratio of bad-to-good ideas, and the same insane puppet freakiness, as its infamous contemporary `Troll.'  It's got one horrible performance by a teen actress who went on to become a big star, and another by a noted wack-job rock star in a punk hairdo and an obscene outfit (and with plenty of awful songs).  But `Labyrinth' enjoys a cult following of serious fans that transcends camp, and someday I'd love to have somebody explain to me why.  2 out of 10.

Watching them is like watching a train wreck in slow motion.  With this one I have hit the mother load!  This is certainly among the most botched releases in Hollywood history.  The level of incompetence is staggering.  Somehow this mess it is still watchable, if only to grimace at the colossal waste of time and money. The fact that it earned money and spawned a sequel speaks of the monumental gullibility of the movie-viewing public and the sheer idiocy of Hollywood executives.  Note to the producers you cannot fool most people more than once with the same gag.  Your sequel will undoubtedly lose all the money you made on this dog (no pun intended.)So there is really no reason to write an actual review as this not an actual movie, but I will give it go anyway.First of all, I hated Scoob as a kid.  It was absolutely the most mind-numbing thing on TV (and that is really saying something!)  I didn't like The Brady Bunch either (another staple of the after-school TV diet designed to turn kids into mindless zombies, not unlike the kids in this movie), but I absolutely loved the movie (and the sequel!)  This movie follows the identical formula transplant the dated characters and plot lines into the present, add some tasteless sight gags and of course a few nods to the original that wink at viewers, while skewering the source material.  The last ingredient only works if the audience truly dislikes the original, which is why most true fans see this movie as spitting on the icon.  So if you hadn't read the opening paragraph, you might wager that I liked this movie.  Well, read on.Starting with the plot.  What plot?  I thought the original series was thin on story, but this movie takes it to another level.  The less said about it the better.  I don't know what the screenwriter got for this, but (quoting another Hanna-Barbera creation) he should have got life!As for acting, the portrayal of Shaggy is spot on!  The rest of the performances aren't worth discussion, except for that of Rowan Atkinson (of Black Adder and Mr. Bean fame.)  This guy is inherently hilarious, so he must have been directed to turn in the most leaden performance he could muster (that or he was sleep-walking.)Speaking of direction, what direction?  The same goes for editing.  The whole experience is disjointed and seems slapped together at the last minute.  The entire budget must have gone for CGI effects and set pieces. They aren't particularly well done, but they stick out due to the overall cheapness of the rest of the production.  Sock puppets in lieu of CGI monsters seem more appropriate here.Casting?  Oh brother.  Other than Shaggy (who as noted above is absolutely perfect), the casting is an unmitigated failure.  Of particular note, Linda Cardellini is far too adorable to be the dowdy and mannish Velma.  At one point in the movie, the Fred character (trying to comfort an insecure Velma) confides that he likes dorky girls like her too.  Give me a break!  In what sort of bizzaro world would this gorgeous babe feel awkward?The modern character updates are mindless filler and the fart jokes and other departures from good taste fall completely flat.  Not to mention that the pot reference early in the film is clearly inappropriate for the target audience (and don't tell me that kids didn't get that joke!)Even the publicists' work reeks of incompetence.  Who decided to use the utterly unfunny airplane scene as the teaser clip on talk shows?  When I saw that clip (knowing it represented what the producers considered a production highlight), I knew a disaster of biblical proportions was on its way (dogs and cats flying together!)As for good points, the opening ten minutes were great!  Some funny inside jokes, a few twists on the familiar frictions between the all-too-familiar characters had me laughing.  I think it is the precipitous drop-off in quality thereafter that makes this film so disappointing.  The set pieces are largely a waste, but there is one scene where the gang freezes like mannequins in a museum display that is slightly amusing (mainly because this is more in line with the familiar motivations of these characters.)  The voice (and speech impediment) of the title character is perfect, though it would have been more expedient to just recycle the old Rut roh and Rorry sound bites from the original.

The little hairs on the back of your neck stand on end, and you get the feeling that someone is watching you dance the night away through your window.  Well, before you call the cops and tell them you have a peeping tom, why don't you wave at them because your peeping tom just might be...Jimmy Stewart.\tYes, Jimmy Stewart likes to look through peoples windows when they're in their underwear in the movie `Rear Window'.  And to tell you the truth, he does a pretty good job of it too.  Jimmy played a character named Jeff who was confined to a wheelchair in his apartment as a result of a broken leg.  He was perfectly cynical, and his idleness, and curiosity of other people's private world was his downfall.  Jeff was like a stereotypical house wife who gets caught up in their `stories', or soap operas.  Jeff was becoming more and more absorbed in the private worlds outside of his rear window until he was finally sucked into that world in the shocking conclusion.  Jimmy Stewart played this character with strength and established Jeff's cynicism, stubbornness and his meddlesome tendencies.  \t\tBut the viewer wasn't always paying attention to Jimmy and his paranoia, because there was often times something a little easier on the eyes on the screen.  The beautiful Grace Kelly played opposite of Jimmy Stewart.  Even though her beauty was undeniable, she was more hypnotic than anything else.  It was in the way she delivered her lines with such, dare I say, grace.  Her parents weren't kidding when they named her after beauty.\tHitchcock used his resources to create beauty in every frame that appealed to all five senses and most emotions also.  And even more amazing is how he filmed the whole movie out of the little apartment, and made it both an interesting story which built to a fantastic crescendo, but his cinematic genius was also stimulating to the mind.  Hitchcock created visual metaphors of Maslow's Hierarchy of needs and of basic, raw humanity.  He accomplished this with his set that had a apartment building that symbolized the human state, with the rock bottom sad people in the lower apartments and the happy people in the top floor apartments.  \tHitchcock's film `Rear Window' had many levels much like his metaphorical apartment building.  And from every angle there was something to appreciate in this movie.  It captured beauty, it captured humanity, it reflected raw and polished life.  `Rear Window' is in every sense of the word `art'.

So when I discovered this title just two nights ago at an American Family Video store, I had never heard of it. Little did I suspect that the whole rest of the world apparently did. I read the back of it, it sounded interesting and the video box promised a surprise ending. Let's check it out, I said to myself, just out of curiosity.So imagine my anger and disgust when as soon as I've paid for it, the young clerk working there--as he was handing it to me after paying for it, no less--in one eight-word-long sentence, suddenly and completely without warning BLURBS OUT THE SECRET ENDING!I was shocked and angry and told him I wanted my money back. I got a refund and still rented it, only this time I rented it elsewhere. But even so, I was very very angry and upset.So as you can imagine I couldn't help feeling like the entire viewing experience of SOYLENT GREEN was tainted for me while watching it. I wish I knew what it was like to experience it for the first time without knowing the ending first. Now I'll never know.But anyway, as I quickly describe the plot, *I* will *NOT* give anything away. I promise. I don't care how well-known this ending is, I'm not taking any chances for anyone. I'm not even going to say SPOILERS AHEAD because I refuse to even discuss the ending. I'm not going to risk accidentally giving away the ending to anyone in my position the way that clerk did.It's the year 2022 and the world is massively overpopulated. Resources are exhausted, food is scare, and New York City alone is swarming with 40 million people--half of them out of work. Enter Thorne (Charlton Heston), a freelance detective hired to investigate the murder of a rich citizen. That's all I'll say, I promise.The crowds scenes were pretty disappointing to me personally, as I had been lured into renting this movie from its striking cover art depicting a city of immense crowds being scooped away. We don't get to see any really huge, epic-looking scenes like that here the way we did is, say, the cheapie TV movie THE DAY AFTER. I found that to be a personal disappointment. Also, the dumptrucks weren't as massive of as threatening-looking as they are in said illustration. But even so, the idea of humans lives being so cheap and useless is still creepy and upsetting.The movie no longer really holds the power to scare, though. Back when I was a child in the 70s, people were fearful of overpopulation. Who could have known that then that something equally as bad would appear--that legalized abortion would come to pass and that this heinous act would put a sharp DROP on the population by being used as a cruel form of birth control, showing a cheapness on human life which in its own way is every bit as creepy as what we are witnessing here in this movie? But even so, the movie still addresses important concepts and the importance of responsibility.One of the things this film reminded me of personally is how well many of us really have it. Even when stressed with bills and debt, running water, canned food, electricity and such are a luxury compared to living conditions of other people in many areas of the world. We should be genuinely grateful and appreciative of what we have.And I loved the friendship portrayed between Throne and his mentor Sol, which is heartbreaking and touching, especially during a grand finale scene set to music by Beethoven (familiar to fans of FANTASIA) that stung my eyes with tears.I'm sure I would have been even more drawn into this story and its climax, IF A CERTAIN AIRHEADED VIDEO STORE CLERK HADN'T GONE AND SPOILED THE ENTIRE ENDING FOR ME.

In my opinion, this is the best of the JASON movies. Jason in space?  What a great concept!  This movie combined two of my favorite genres, horror and science fiction.  The movie delivers on all counts.  It has a great story line, and terrific special effects.  The movie is non-stop action and the killings are very creative.  This movie is very gorey, and in fact, I would say it is the most gorey installment of the FRIDAY THE 13th movies so far.  And without a doubt, this is the funniest movie of the series.  It has some really great laughs.  The director definitely seems to have a well developed sense of humor and a true love of action, horror, and sci fi.  This movie is awesome.  I loved the part when the space ship crashes in to the space station and then the space station explodes.  Also the part when the grunt gets cut in half and the next shot you see is the poor guy dragging half his body across the floor.The characters are all likable and memorable.  Not to mention, this installment of the series definitely has the HOTTEST girls.  There are not too many other movies in general to come to my mind that have women of this calibre.In particular, I have to mention Melody Johnson.  She played the character Kinsa.

The hologram sequence at the end where the upgraded Jason returns to Crystal Lake and encounters HOT co-eds is priceless.  The two girls offer Jason beer and pot, and then exclaim We love premarital sex.  Then Jason beats them to death by wrapping them up in their sleeping bags and smashing them into a tree.

This is the story of Jake LaMotta, one of Brooklyn's most famous middle weight boxers. His story begins in New York in 1941 when Jake was in the ring with Jimmy Reeves. Jake was lethal with those boxing gloves and though he gave it his all, Reeves won the fight. Jake might have been a winner at boxing, but he was a loser in the outside world and his home life was no exception. He and his wife, Lenore, were always having terrible fights. Jake was basically in a rut, until one day his brother, Joey, introduced him to a 16 year old beautiful blond named Vickie. Jake invited her for a drive, then they played miniature golf and then they went back to Jake's place. Jake found himself very much attracted to Vickie; 1943- Jake is in the ring with a new and fierce competitor, Sugar Ray Robinson. Jake and Vickie were still close. Apparently Lenore had left him. But can you blame her? Sure. She was always yelling at Jake, even when he and Joey went out. Well, from 1944 to 1947 Jake continued fighting in the ring and the matches took him as far as Detroit. In 1945 he and Vickie were married. In 1946, Joey got married as well and they settled down, raised a family. Jake's fighting was starting to suffer a bit due to his compulsive eating disorder. His goal was originally to lose weight, but he ended up gaining weight.          Jake also started to suspect his wife of having an affair whenever he was out. At a night club, Joey and Vickie met up. Joey got somewhat hostile with her and when a brash fellow, Sal, rubbed him the wrong way, Joey proceeded to beat him. He even dragged him out front and bashed his head with a taxi cab door. Well, Tommy Como had Joey and Sal shake and make-up. Como was an important man because with his help, Jake was destined to become the champ. Well, Jake went up against a man named Tony Jinero and he really laid into him. Jake laid a dozen or so punches and really beat the daylights out of Jinero. In 1949, Jake was given the golden belt and proclaimed a champion. A year goes by and Jake, now somewhat fatter and more paranoid and driven closer and closer to insanity, began to suspect his wife of adultery even more. He even questioned Joey about it, who told Jake he was nuts. But in secret, Vickie and Joey did have something. Jake tried talking to Vickie about it and became very hostile with her. She finally admitted it and that did it. Jake, in a fit of rage, went over to Joey's house and beat him senseless.        Jake entered the ring with Sugar Ray Robinson again and this time, Robinson got his revenge. He just laid into Jake very badly and caused much permanent damage; 1956- Jake, Vickie and the kids have moved down to Miami. Jake has retired from boxing and has opened his own night club. Of course he still had his eating disorder and was in terrible financial trouble. He owed $10,000 which he didn't have, and as if that weren't bad enough, Vickie filed for divorce and got the kids. Well, Jake was thrown in jail in 1957. He became hostile so he was sent to the hole. But he got out in 1958 and continued performing at his night club, found a new fianceé and made amends with Joey. And we come to the present day in 1964 where Jake LaMotta, still baring wounds from past fights and now very much overweight, was preparing to go out and give it his all--at his night club comedy performance.         Robert DeNiro delivers a stellar performance and even got an Oscar for his role as Jake LaMotta. The real LaMotta knew DeNiro and was there when they worked on the movie! And everybody's favorite, Joe Pesci, is here as Joey LaMotta. Joe delivered his usual F-this and F- that routine, which served some light comedy in some scenes. Cathy Moriarty was real sexy. Frank Vincent is Sal and as you know, he is Joe Pesci's victim in this movie and in Goodfellas. But the tables turn in Casino. Those two were also directed by Marty Scorsese. This movie was done in black and white. Why? I don't know. I guess to add atmosphere. This movie is not for everyone. It's got intense drama and much violence.

This is the story of Jake LaMotta, one of Brooklyn's most famous middle weight boxers. His story begins in New York in 1941 when Jake was in the ring with Jimmy Reeves. Jake was lethal with those boxing gloves and though he gave it his all, Reeves won the fight. Jake might have been a winner at boxing, but he was a loser in the outside world and his home life was no exception. He and his wife, Lenore, were always having terrible fights. Jake was basically in a rut, until one day his brother, Joey, introduced him to a 16 year old beautiful blond named Vickie. Jake invited her for a drive, then they played miniature golf and then they went back to Jake's place. Jake found himself very much attracted to Vickie; 1943- Jake is in the ring with a new and fierce competitor, Sugar Ray Robinson. Jake and Vickie were still close. Apparently Lenore had left him. But can you blame her? Sure. She was always yelling at Jake, even when he and Joey went out. Well, from 1944 to 1947 Jake continued fighting in the ring and the matches took him as far as Detroit. In 1945 he and Vickie were married. In 1946, Joey got married as well and they settled down, raised a family. Jake's fighting was starting to suffer a bit due to his compulsive eating disorder. His goal was originally to lose weight, but he ended up gaining weight.          Jake also started to suspect his wife of having an affair whenever he was out. At a night club, Joey and Vickie met up. Joey got somewhat hostile with her and when a brash fellow, Sal, rubbed him the wrong way, Joey proceeded to beat him. He even dragged him out front and bashed his head with a taxi cab door. Well, Tommy Como had Joey and Sal shake and make-up. Como was an important man because with his help, Jake was destined to become the champ. Well, Jake went up against a man named Tony Jinero and he really laid into him. Jake laid a dozen or so punches and really beat the daylights out of Jinero. In 1949, Jake was given the golden belt and proclaimed a champion. A year goes by and Jake, now somewhat fatter and more paranoid and driven closer and closer to insanity, began to suspect his wife of adultery even more. He even questioned Joey about it, who told Jake he was nuts. But in secret, Vickie and Joey did have something. Jake tried talking to Vickie about it and became very hostile with her. She finally admitted it and that did it. Jake, in a fit of rage, went over to Joey's house and beat him senseless.        Jake entered the ring with Sugar Ray Robinson again and this time, Robinson got his revenge. He just laid into Jake very badly and caused much permanent damage; 1956- Jake, Vickie and the kids have moved down to Miami. Jake has retired from boxing and has opened his own night club. Of course he still had his eating disorder and was in terrible financial trouble. He owed $10,000 which he didn't have, and as if that weren't bad enough, Vickie filed for divorce and got the kids. Well, Jake was thrown in jail in 1957. He became hostile so he was sent to the hole. But he got out in 1958 and continued performing at his night club, found a new fianceé and made amends with Joey. And we come to the present day in 1964 where Jake LaMotta, still baring wounds from past fights and now very much overweight, was preparing to go out and give it his all--at his night club comedy performance.         Robert DeNiro delivers a stellar performance and even got an Oscar for his role as Jake LaMotta. The real LaMotta knew DeNiro and was there when they worked on the movie! And everybody's favorite, Joe Pesci, is here as Joey LaMotta. Joe delivered his usual F-this and F- that routine, which served some light comedy in some scenes. Cathy Moriarty was real sexy. Frank Vincent is Sal and as you know, he is Joe Pesci's victim in this movie and in Goodfellas. But the tables turn in Casino. Those two were also directed by Marty Scorsese. This movie was done in black and white. Why? I don't know. I guess to add atmosphere. This movie is not for everyone. It's got intense drama and much violence. But if you like Scorsese\/DeNiro\/Pesci films, then to you I recommend Raging Bull. See Goodfellas, it's also good, and Casino, which is far more extreme than Goodfellas.

Though Rushmore counts as more amusing than Anderson's impenetrably dull Royal Tenenbaums, I am really missing the point of this director's existence in the film industry thus far.  I see his aesthetic drowning what could be brilliant, substantively hilarious and charming material.  It's a mystery why actors of the stature of so many in Rushmore and Tenenbaums are giving this guy the time of day. The source material calls for the film's essential quirkiness and I don't really mind Max's completely histrionic character--in fact, it's somewhat believable and, at times, totally likable and quite funny.  The inherent disjointedness of the film's narrative structure, however, makes it impossible to make any logical story arc over the mostly affable messiness in between.  A keen example of this is Max's relationship with Miss Cross, which goes from good to horrible to good to bad to who knows at the end.  In fact, she inexplicably seems a bit forlorn for Max at the end (hence the well-composed dance between the two at the end).  The love triangle created by Murray's Blume is completely lost and disjointed in the mix, even in this intentionally disjointed comedy.   The acting stands out--Schwartzman has to be commended for a fine turn as the neurotic and sometimes manic (if that even makes sense--is it possible to be sometimes manic?) Fischer, especially since it appears to be one of his first acting jobs.  As Miss Cross, Olivia Williams is worth her weight in gold and is completely believable as the understated luminescent English love interest.  Bill Murray does fine and is not miscast--but he absolutely seems misused.  His vague perambulations around the film seem reminiscent of Lost of Translation (or vice-versa). I see some genius in Anderson's style, but it is getting lost in what seems to be a misplaced endeavor to be clever.  I actually read most of the screenplay before watching Rushmore and see real brilliance there, but the story doesn't play out as well on film as on the sheet.  Give him one or two more movies and I think he will eventually make a crackerjack great movie.  Oh wait, I'm contradicting myself.... Maybe he deserves to get the time of day.

Good film.  ","genre":"Action, Crime, Drama"}]
