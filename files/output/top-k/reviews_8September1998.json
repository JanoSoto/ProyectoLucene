Although the film is admittedly shy on a few innovative plot twists, the art direction and stunts make up for the traditional action plot.Under the wing of John Woo, Antoine Fuqua manages to pull of his own artistic child that astounds, and at times, even surpasses Woo's own work in the US. The colors that Fuqua uses really set the tone for the scenes where the action is more mute, allowing for the character development which is surprisingly rich for an action film. As for the action sequences, they are done with superb skill and direction, allowing the viewer to see what is going on without making them feel like they're trapped in a box. The entire movie is truly an artwork in motion, filled with graphic sites such as innocent bystander being killed and the audience actually gets angry instead of the passive emotion that would normally follow such an act. Along with the sights, the sounds and music of the movie sets the mood in exactly the right direction, pumping up the audience for a fantastic shoot out sequence and then toning down letting the audience recover and reflect about the character's dilemmas.Overall, The Replacement Killers takes you for an hour and a half ride through an art museum, while still letting you bring the guns along.

All the people who say that TITANIC is the greatest movie ever made so easily disregard films that have endured over the decades and still retain the qualities that made them great movies in the first place.  Perfect example GONE WITH THE WIND.  Excuse me, people, but Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet do not, and I don't think they ever will, have the star quality of Clark Gable and Viven Leigh.  Wait 60 or 70 years and see if TITANIC is still called a classic.  Make plans with your grandchildren and a Ouija board so you can find out.One of the biggest disappointments of the movie was the character of Molly Brown.  Where was the woman who took charge of one of the lifeboats?  Kathy Bates gave a caricatured performance (no doubt the fault of Cameron's atrocious script - the product of a 24 hr. marathon session if I ever saw one) of a woman who was in reality a true heroine.  In the movie, the officer in the lifeboat tells her to shut up and she does.  The Molly Brown in A NIGHT TO REMEMBER is still the best portrayal.The other actors are equally undistinguished.  Frances Fisher, Billy Zane  (what was with the eyeliner?) and David Warner were the heavies and all they lacked were black moustaches they could twirl.  If Cameron's script had had Zane tie Winslet to the railroad tracks, it wouldn't have seemed out of place.  David Warner put in a much better performance in about 25% of the screen time in STAR TREK VI.The FX, while admirable, were not breathtaking and certainly not enough to keep the rest of the movie afloat.  For people who like a well-rounded movie and who don't want to pay a full admission price for only half -enjoyment, TITANIC falls far short.For those fans who point out that this wasn't intended to be a documentary there were plenty of fascinating, true stories that happened on the Titanic.  Cameron could have changed names and brought them to the screen  (such as the suspected murderess-nanny) rather than film a poor excuse for a Victorian gaslight melodrama.

The film tells the story of three people who are lost in the Canadian Rockies when their plane crashes.  From this pedestrian-sounding premise comes a movie that is really about the relationship that develops between two very different men a brilliant, intellectual billionaire, played with characteristic genius by Anthony Hopkins, and a fashion photographer, played by Alec Baldwin.  As the movie progresses, the superficial friendliness that they showed each other in civilization is destroyed and replaced by something much more complex and interesting.  The dialogue, written by dialogue god David Mamet, is clever, rhythmic, and thought -provoking.  The visceral aspects are also wonderful, with the unbelievably beautiful Canadian wilderness in the background and a rather high-tension action\/adventure plot in the foreground.

After his repeated failures in this area, he meets the new French exchange student next door, Monique. Although he is still hung up on Beth, he starts to find that Monique appreciates him more for who he is and not what he could be. The fly in the ointment is the house where she is living. This mother and son ( Ricky) team could definitely qualify for the screens strangest family. As Lane puts it, Ricky spends all day snorting nasal spray.

It is a remarkable performance for which she won 1968's Oscar for Best Actress (in an astonishing tie with Katherine Hepburn).  Although she has done several notable film projects since then  (and some better left to the late night movie circuit), this movie IMO is her all-around best performance. Every facet of her talent is displayed her beautiful comic timing, her (then) unexpected dramatic abilities, and her singing is like gangbusters!  She doesn't try to act in this film, she just IS, and it works spectacularly well.  Certainly the character is clearly written with her talents and personality in mind, but she also manages to evoke what must have been the effect that Fanny Brice had over audiences in her time.  A must-see for movie musical enthusiasts!  The ending of the Don't Rain on My Parade sequence has to belong to the top five classical moments from Hollywood musicals.

It's a gore experience, it doesn't need plot.Acting Bruce Campbell looks like he's been taking something rather quite strong - although it could be the make-up he wears for most of the film.
