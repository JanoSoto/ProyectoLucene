If it hadn't been for the prospective of seeing some of Quentin's and Robert's work, I would have stopped this film after a mere 10 minutes. I mean the acting was soooo bad I think everybody who thinks Madonna is bad should check this out to see who is worse. The story was pretty worthless as well and the whole thing really got me thinking Am I gonna be able to keep watching Ted the bellboy for 90 minutes+? 3,5 out of 10 Segment 2 The wrong man Immediately a big improvement over the first segment and a definite step towards Robert's and Quentin's style of directing and story-telling. Upon hearing Angela's monologue (or should I say word-list) the film really started to get a Tarantino vibe and I loved it. But most importantly, the acting got a lot better here and Ted wasn't as irritating as in the first segment. Story-wise it was OK. Not very original, but there were some funny elements in it.6 out of 10 Segment 3 The misbehavers I knew this one was Rodriguez all along, for having Banderas in it and I must say I was a bit surprised with the bit at first, since it felt much more like a bit out of Dennis the Menace than anything I had expected out of Rodriguez for such a film (ALSO Spy Kids wasn't made back then you know). Nonetheless I really felt this was a fresh piece, combining Rated-R elements very well with mischievous comedy. Oh MAN!, back then Rodriguez still had it (don't blame me for not having seen Sin City yet!!!).7 out of 10 Segment 4 The man from Hollywood Judging from the quality of the last segment, the motto of this ensemble film must have been from worst to best, because with his segment, Tarantino puts the icing on the cake. The direction is top notch, the acting is good and there is a lot of tension and intensity in the room, which keeps the bit vibrant and exciting throughout. I know many Tarantino-haters will say Can't you see, this guy steals everything!. While I think Tarantino's piece in 'Four Rooms' will be the perfect aim for all their criticism, I regard his 'stealing' as inspiration, because when one is true to oneself one must admit that every story has been told before in one way or another. And if (I say IF) Tarantino is a copycat, he's a truly brilliant and original one, cause let's face it, his dialog's are one of a kind.7,5 out of 10 ","genre":null},{"date":"5 May 2005","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Segment 1 The missing ingredient Man what a torture this was.

The movie starts when Eva was a young girl and follows her story until her death. Surrounding Eva's story is the turbulent times of her native Argentina. The story primarily occurs in the 1940s and early 1950s. This time period is one of great social upheaval, military and political fighting, and worker rebellions. Through it all, Eva became Evita, arguably the most prolific and infamous individual Argentina has ever produced. This movie is historically accurate but is biased towards Eva. This movie only touches the issues surrounding Evita's rise to infamy. The plot shows Eva and her ambitious rise to the top. The movie showed her using men to get to where she wanted to be and finally falling deeply in love with Juan Peron, future husband and president of Argentina. The director left out a lot of truth, but did not lie in the movie. The director also showed the perspective of both the well-to-do, who opposed Peron, and the poor workers, who supported Peron. The director left out much of the seriousness of the infighting surrounding Eva's position in government; the infighting was much more intense. Many hated Evita. The movie, as a story, was very enjoyable, especially if you like musicals. The music is very dramatic, as is most of Andrew Lloyd Weber's music. Viewers should also remember that this is a musical; there is very little un-sung dialogue in the movie. Since this is a musical, viewers must listen to the music and its lyrics to understand what is going on. The performances were great and very entertaining. The movie was also educational, because it portrays the significance of Eva and Juan Peron and the impact they had on society in Argentina. Overall, the movie was easy to understand with little or no knowledge of Argentina's history (everyone can generally understand what is going on). The movie sparked my interest (and could possibly spark other's interests) in the subject and encouraged me to research the Perons more in depth. On a scale of 1-10, I would rate this movie an 8. I give it an 8, because historically, the movie is biased and leaves out a lot of information. But, I and the viewers must remember that this movie is largely a love story. The movie is very fun, informative, and a great story. The actors did a fantastic job and the music was great. People who like musicals will love this movie.

There's more than meets the eye, as everybody knows by now, and the first time you see it, if you don't know the surprise, it's an excellent movie.Like I said, everybody knows the secret by now, it's like the sled in Citizen Kane or the penis in The Crying Game, so it doesn't even feel necessary to warn that there's a spoiler herein. Bruce Willis is dead! Now, if you were one of the people who found this out before seeing the movie, I bet it ruined it a little for you. And this is the problem with this movie; knowing the surprise spoils it a little bit, and since the surprise is nothing more than a gimmick (albeit a well-done gimmick), I think this movie relies a little bit too much on the gimmick to be considered a great movie.I didn't know the first time I saw it, by the way, and I was blown away. In 1999, it was one of the best movies of 1999. Make no mistake. It wasn't until it was released on DVD that things started to go downhill.Let me explain. I said at the top that this is actually 3 different movies, and it is; it's like a chameleon.1)You're seeing it for the first time, and you don't know how it comes out. Excellent. The surprise is terrific; I figured it out, but not until about 5 minutes before it was revealed anyway, and I know there are definitely people who didn't figure it out, even though they were trying to figure out something. The first time, you really appreciate the performances by Bruce Willis, Haley Joel Ozment, and Toni Collette. They all do outstanding jobs, and this is the one aspect of the movie that really does hold up over time. 10\/10.2) You're seeing it for the second time. You know that Bruce Willis is dead, and you appreciate the work that went into concealing this fact, paying attention for some little slip-up and not finding it. But really, let's be honest; on the second viewing, and probably to an extent on any subsequent viewings, you're giving your full attention to the execution of the gimmick. And it's still good, there's a lot to appreciate here. 9\/10.3) You're seeing it for the third time, and any time after that. You know that Bruce Willis is dead, and you know how artistically this was hidden throughout. So what's left? Well, the fine performances, and the creepy atmospherics, and the entertaining story. So let's not penalize the movie too much at this point, but over time, the quality definitely does wear down, because to some extent, you're still constantly thinking about that gimmick. 7\/10, the rating I gave above.And really, there's a fourth aspect to all this; you're seeing it for the first time, and some dip**** spoiled it for you. Well, you may actually be in a pretty good position. You know Bruce Willis is dead, so on the one hand, you're not pulled in so much by the gimmick, and you can appreciate the other aspects that made this movie good; on the other hand, the surprise is lost on you. You see, it's a completely different movie if you knew the gimmick the first time, and you will never see it the same way as others did. That's a shame, but at least you weren't trying all along to figure it out, and thus, the performances by Willis, Osment, and Collette may seem all the brighter. I can't comment on how viewers would have rated the movie in this position, because I wasn't one of them. But I think they would have liked it.So there you have it. AT LEAST 3 different movies, and at least 3 different ratings. I do give it points for being able to change so much on repeated viewings, but I have to take away some, because the power the movie has over you is influenced so much by that gimmick. It's not that it has become a bad movie over the years, but it has lost its status as a great movie.

You see, it's a completely different movie if you knew the gimmick the first time, and you will never see it the same way as others did. That's a shame, but at least you weren't trying all along to figure it out, and thus, the performances by Willis, Osment, and Collette may seem all the brighter. I can't comment on how viewers would have rated the movie in this position, because I wasn't one of them. But I think they would have liked it.So there you have it. AT LEAST 3 different movies, and at least 3 different ratings. I do give it points for being able to change so much on repeated viewings, but I have to take away some, because the power the movie has over you is influenced so much by that gimmick. It's not that it has become a bad movie over the years, but it has lost its status as a great movie.

There's more than meets the eye, as everybody knows by now, and the first time you see it, if you don't know the surprise, it's an excellent movie.Like I said, everybody knows the secret by now, it's like the sled in Citizen Kane or the penis in The Crying Game, so it doesn't even feel necessary to warn that there's a spoiler herein. Bruce Willis is dead! Now, if you were one of the people who found this out before seeing the movie, I bet it ruined it a little for you. And this is the problem with this movie; knowing the surprise spoils it a little bit, and since the surprise is nothing more than a gimmick (albeit a well-done gimmick), I think this movie relies a little bit too much on the gimmick to be considered a great movie.I didn't know the first time I saw it, by the way, and I was blown away. In 1999, it was one of the best movies of 1999. Make no mistake. It wasn't until it was released on DVD that things started to go downhill.Let me explain. I said at the top that this is actually 3 different movies, and it is; it's like a chameleon.1)You're seeing it for the first time, and you don't know how it comes out. Excellent. The surprise is terrific; I figured it out, but not until about 5 minutes before it was revealed anyway, and I know there are definitely people who didn't figure it out, even though they were trying to figure out something. The first time, you really appreciate the performances by Bruce Willis, Haley Joel Ozment, and Toni Collette. They all do outstanding jobs, and this is the one aspect of the movie that really does hold up over time. 10\/10.2) You're seeing it for the second time. You know that Bruce Willis is dead, and you appreciate the work that went into concealing this fact, paying attention for some little slip-up and not finding it. But really, let's be honest; on the second viewing, and probably to an extent on any subsequent viewings, you're giving your full attention to the execution of the gimmick. And it's still good, there's a lot to appreciate here. 9\/10.3) You're seeing it for the third time, and any time after that. You know that Bruce Willis is dead, and you know how artistically this was hidden throughout. So what's left? Well, the fine performances, and the creepy atmospherics, and the entertaining story. So let's not penalize the movie too much at this point, but over time, the quality definitely does wear down, because to some extent, you're still constantly thinking about that gimmick. 7\/10, the rating I gave above.And really, there's a fourth aspect to all this; you're seeing it for the first time, and some dip**** spoiled it for you. Well, you may actually be in a pretty good position. You know Bruce Willis is dead, so on the one hand, you're not pulled in so much by the gimmick, and you can appreciate the other aspects that made this movie good; on the other hand, the surprise is lost on you.

Think of the legalization of the gay marriage, euthanasia, abortion,... All that has already been accepted in that little, unknown and unloved country that we call Belgium, but thanks to all those conservative religious fanatics in America that are against everything that might make life a bit fun or bearable, we always get some good laughs over here. In case you didn't know it yet most of us don't worship the devil, but are good catholics ... most of us, hahaha.Why this little text you ask yourself? Well, because this movie is about one of those subjects. It talks about a young woman called Ruth Stoops, a pregnant drug using and glue\/paint sniffing junk who has already had her other children taken away from her. When she's convicted by a judge, she gets the advice to have the unborn child removed, because it won't have any future with its mother. In return she won't get convicted for child abuse. But while in jail she meets people who are member of the pro-life group the Babysavers. These people convince her (brainwash her is a better word for it, if you see the tactics that they use) not to give up the baby. And before Ruth really understands what is happening to her, she suddenly finds herself in the middle of a war between the Babysavers and a group that supports abortion...Most actors in this movie did a very good job, but personally I liked Laura Dern's performance most. She was very convincing as the drug addicted mother and was very funny to watch in the second half of the movie when she had to decide which camp she would chose. At first this movie was just too serious to call it a comedy. I'm not saying it wasn't any good, but it felt a bit too real to my taste. At first I had the feeling that this movie was created by some people who really wanted to give a powerful message against abortion to the world. Only late in the movie, I finally understood that this wasn't the case and at that moment I started to enjoy it a lot more. That's why I give this movie a 6.5\/10 perhaps even a 7\/10. I like the fact that they try to make fun of the subject, only too bad that they didn't start with that from the beginning.

It's not exactly the same of course, but you'll certainly recognize the same style of images and narration and the idea behind it.This time it isn't about birds, but about insects. I know, many people don't like those creepy little creatures and to be honest, neither do I, but why shouldn't you try to get to know them a little bit better? Indeed, there's no reason why not, except for when you are terrified to even watch them on a TV-screen of course. And when you watch this documentary, I can assure you that it will surprise you, because this is the first time anybody has ever watched and portrayed these little animals in such a magnificent way. You are really able to penetrate their world and to see that meadow, pond or garden in which they live as one giant universe, their world.

I am not one of Sly's detractors, I have enjoyed his performances in films such as Rocky, First Blood, Paradise Alley, Copland and even Demolition Man. However this performance bares no resemblance to the character of Judge Dredd.Stallone's character lacks the authority and quiet confidence of Judge Dredd. Sly seems to have replaced these aspects with standing in a tough pose, looking intense and shouting were applicable.

Unlike the similarly-panned Showgirls, Glitter doesn't go far enough over the top to be of any interest, and it takes itself way too seriously. Showgirls made me feel giddy while I was watching it. Glitter made me feel as if I had been poisoned.What an unfortunate mis-step for star Mariah Carey, who gets sucked up into the vacuum of this movie like a dust bunny under the Hoover. It's not that Mariah is terrible, exactly. She doesn't seem like much of an actress, and she definitely doesn't have much screen presence. But the real problem is that she doesn't really do much except smile, sing, and look pretty. She simply exists. Perhaps since Glitter is touted as a semi-autobiographical film like Purple Rain, the producers thought being Mariah Carey would be enough to carry the film. Her role is shallow and one-dimensional, despite the fact that the script tries to give her some depth by piling on the age-old wayward childhood cliché. The problem is we've seen all of this so often that it's very silly.It only gets worse as the movie progresses. After Mariah's character, Billie, grows up, she meets an obnoxious club DJ who, much to our horror, turns out to be the movie's other main character. Carey and her costar, Max Beesley, have next to zero screen chemistry, but for some reasons she falls in love with him.The director throws in a bunch of gimmicky techniques, like speeding up the film, as well as a hilariously awful cut that goes from Mariah's face to fireworks exploding. There is also a laugh-out-loud moment where the actress who plays the young Billie Frank joins her mother onstage and when she opens her mouth to sing, it is Mariah Carey's voice that comes out of her--pitched up until she sounds a little like Minnie Mouse. No wonder Mariah collapsed after this was released.There are some absurd and awful moments in the film that have nothing to do with Mariah, most notably her two obnoxious friends who are directed as complete caricatures and seem to be intended for some sort of comic relief (there's plenty of that in other places, all of it unintentional).Beesley is supposed to be a big-time club DJ, yet he plays more like a kid at a high-school dance. The role is all wrong for him. For some inexplicable reason, the film is set in the early 80s, yet more often than not it looks suspiciously like the early 00's (especially the furniture). The dialog is unmemorable and nobody has any real acting to do in this film, except for one or two emotional moments. The drama is uninvolving, and it doesn't really spiral out of control until the conclusion of the movie, where it soars so far into the absurd that we finally get some good bad movie stuff (a big fight, a beating, a murder, a campy moment of triumph onstage). It's too little, too late though.The one thing that Glitter manages to carry off is a cliché but somewhat engaging scene where Billie finally meets up her long-lost mother. Unfortunately, it is the final scene of the movie, and the camera sails right up into the sky just when we get to the one moment in the film that works.

The lighting is atrocious, the acting wooden, the scene structure is like your standard sitcom template, and the editing is childish and uneven. The lighting during the blackout scene, for example, was awful, as was the lighting during the robberies of the actual safes. Someone lights a match and the entire set lights up like daytime. A guy shines a flashlight into a safe and a stage light hits him in the face so brightly that he literally has to squint. Lights were reflecting off of people's faces when it was supposed to be a blackout. Kind of like how in The Great Escape when all the prisoners are crawling out of the tunnel, they're lit so brightly that it's almost impossible to believe that the German guards didn't see them. They might as well have pulled off the escape in the middle of the day. Then again, this was during the time when filmmakers were transitioning away from day-for-night photography and learning how to actually shoot at night. Also consider the scene were the red balloons floated in front of the camera to show the five casinos simultaneously, seconds before the stroke of midnight. Those balloons floating in front of the camera were edited so badly that it's astounding to me that it made it into the final cut like that. Taking five frames off the beginning and end of each clip would have smoothed the sequence out perfectly. Even so, this is an outstanding film, although I have to say it is one of the rare cases where I liked the remake better than the original. It is also one of the rare cases where the extensive changes made in the remake are justified, because Las Vegas was an entirely different world in 2001 from what it was in 1960. You couldn't, for example, go into a casino and start spraying a mysterious substance onto various door handles in plain sight and with wide, swooping arm motions. Security must have been either extremely lax or bordering on incompetent back then, because you wouldn't have even needed surveillance cameras to see what some of these guys were doing. All you would need was to be awake.One thing that I definitely liked better about the original film than the remake, however, was the love story involving Danny Ocean, which was spectacularly botched in the 2001 version of the movie. The difference in the endings of the films is also one of the bigger differences, I tend to prefer the original ending, although I can understand why it was changed for the remake the way it was. How could you make a movie with George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts, Don Cheadle, and Matt Damon and not design the ending to be conducive to a sequel?If you get this movie on DVD, make sure to check out the Map of Las Vegas videos in the Special Features. There are some cool little short videos about the casinos in the movie in 1960 and the same casinos today, the ones that are still standing, at least. I found it particularly interesting because I took a trip to Las Vegas a couple weeks ago and stayed at the Sahara. It's amazing how much the town has changed.

Kind of like how in The Great Escape when all the prisoners are crawling out of the tunnel, they're lit so brightly that it's almost impossible to believe that the German guards didn't see them. They might as well have pulled off the escape in the middle of the day. Then again, this was during the time when filmmakers were transitioning away from day-for-night photography and learning how to actually shoot at night. Also consider the scene were the red balloons floated in front of the camera to show the five casinos simultaneously, seconds before the stroke of midnight. Those balloons floating in front of the camera were edited so badly that it's astounding to me that it made it into the final cut like that. Taking five frames off the beginning and end of each clip would have smoothed the sequence out perfectly. Even so, this is an outstanding film, although I have to say it is one of the rare cases where I liked the remake better than the original. It is also one of the rare cases where the extensive changes made in the remake are justified, because Las Vegas was an entirely different world in 2001 from what it was in 1960. You couldn't, for example, go into a casino and start spraying a mysterious substance onto various door handles in plain sight and with wide, swooping arm motions. Security must have been either extremely lax or bordering on incompetent back then, because you wouldn't have even needed surveillance cameras to see what some of these guys were doing. All you would need was to be awake.One thing that I definitely liked better about the original film than the remake, however, was the love story involving Danny Ocean, which was spectacularly botched in the 2001 version of the movie. The difference in the endings of the films is also one of the bigger differences, I tend to prefer the original ending, although I can understand why it was changed for the remake the way it was. How could you make a movie with George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts, Don Cheadle, and Matt Damon and not design the ending to be conducive to a sequel?If you get this movie on DVD, make sure to check out the Map of Las Vegas videos in the Special Features. There are some cool little short videos about the casinos in the movie in 1960 and the same casinos today, the ones that are still standing, at least. I found it particularly interesting because I took a trip to Las Vegas a couple weeks ago and stayed at the Sahara. It's amazing how much the town has changed. Also, if you look around a bit you'll find a 30 second clip of the destruction of the Sands hotel. Fascinating and heartbreaking at the same time.

It's hilarious, and at the same time it's actually about something that matters, and is really depressing at that.Personally I don't think it's blasphemous in any way. It conveys its message in a way that's probably offensive to some people, but it doesn't mock God or Jesus, it doesn't even lash out against religion as a whole. It merely points out the absurdity of people who are too lazy or too stupid to think for themselves, and desperately cling to anybody willing to lead them. Or even unwilling to lead them. You can almost feel the anger and frustration of the writers in some scenes, as if they want to scream God\/Evolution\/Whatever you believe in gave you a mind to think with on your own.

By pure chance, it is also the only M Night Shyamalan film I have any interest in watching (the less said about Signs, the better) so I snapped up the DVD without too much debate.Hardly any wonder to find the star of Sixth Sense, Bruce Willis, back but this time as David Dunn, a former college football star and now married to his childhood sweetheart Audrey (Robin Wright Penn) and father to Joseph (Spencer Treat Clark). But David is not happy. His marriage is failing and his dead-end security job is getting him nowhere. Then one day, his life is flipped upside down after a major train crash. David is the only survivor - indeed, he walks away completely unscathed. Shortly afterwards, he is contacted by eccentric comic collector Elijah Price (Samuel L Jackson) who believes that David may have incredible powers. Initially sceptical, David is eventually forced to confront Elijah's theories and ask himself some difficult, repressed questions about himself.There is quite a lot not to like about this film. Obsessive comic book fans will probably not like the performance of a big wigged Jackson, wide-eyed stare and grandiose dialogue. Willis does his whispering trick again like he did in Sixth Sense and sadly can't portray the emotional turmoil needed for a character like David. Much better are Clark and Penn as David's son and wife, both of whom find themselves questioning David as much as themselves. But the biggest let-down is the story which I found disappointing and not anything like as original as Sixth Sense. But the atmosphere and tension are built up well and the obligatory twist at the end is well written and well disguised. But at no stage did I ever find myself believing this film and anyone looking for a metaphorical meaning will be disappointed as Shyamalan states from the beginning that this is about comics. I suppose one could say that the film teaches us all to be heroes in our own way but I don't think Shyamalan tells fables, only stories.However, perseverance is the key here. Unbreakable never fully hits its stride until the end but when it does, it proves a terrifically tense thriller full of the quasi-supernatural imagery that Shyamalan loves. Willis' hooded poncho standing in the rain makes our hero look like Death himself and I truly respect Shyamalan's ability to show the everyday as being full of symbolism and myth. It's such a shame that the story couldn't be slightly stronger because there is a great film here somewhere and it deserves to be given a chance. It was never going to be another Sixth Sense and disappointing box office returns scuppered plans for an obvious sequel. After all, the best comic book films usually have much more mileage than studio bosses allow. One needs only to look at the Spiderman or X-Men franchises to see how far they can run. Unbreakable could have been one of them but falls just short.

I used to think of him as that guy who was the first to lead the Die Hard franchise towards its(somewhat inevitable but still unfortunate) downfall. After seeing this, I might seriously have to consider seeing more of his films. The plot is fairly good, though it is by no means original. Hero has no memory, past catches up with him\/her(in this case, her) and the rest of the film is about him\/her figuring out said past. Somehow, Harlin makes it seem fresh and new... though I guess writer Shane Black had his part in this as well. The pacing is very good, though one or two scenes in the film seem to drag out unnecessarily. The acting is mostly good... just about every big part is well-played. Geena Davis(who I don't believe I have seen in any other movie, though the name rings a bell) gives a pretty good performance as the dual-personality main character. Jackson is, unsurprisingly, very good. Yvonne Zima is the baby sister of Madeleine Zima(from The Hand That Rocks the Cradle and The Nanny) and... well, I guess talent runs in the family. She does a great job, considering she must have been, what, 7, maybe 8 years old when the film was shot. Craig Bierko(who I recognized almost instantly from The Thirteenth Floor) is great. The action is great. High intensity and nicely stylized. The film is thoroughly entertaining, partly due to the action, but also because of the humor. In a word, it's great. Some of the jokes and gags fall flat, but only in the most rare cases. The dialog is well-written and often quotable. The film is pretty much worth watching if you're into the standard action film... not much new stuff in this one, but the way it's done makes it all come together nicely.
