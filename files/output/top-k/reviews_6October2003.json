Although i have to dissagree with the bulk of his fans and say that this film is his best NOT Heat (it was still an awesome movie).I think my opinion of this film is slightly bias as i am a Huge fan of Al Pacino but even if they got an equally great actor for the same roll, it wouldn't cause this masterpiece to falter in any way.On the outset this does not look like an amazingly gripping film. The true story of a tabaco executive turned whistle blower doesn't make it sound as if it'll be ripe with action or suspence (which the average popcorn junkie craves). That said it's not action you go to see in a Michael Mann film. Even with Heat he brilliantly put characterisation first before the relentlessly violent action set pieces and he keeps the theme going here.There is no action to speak of in this film, just the agonising tension that builds from the moment Wigand (Russel Crowe on top form) is fired from his job and it doesn't let up.Pacino is his usual shouty self but that is what makes him so great. His role as 60 minutes producer Lowel Burhman is brilliantly played out as a man who can't take no for an answer. Watch his noticable dispair as he realises that they will NOT broadcast the show.There is nothing bad about this movie. Mann's direction is his best since the brilliant and gripping Manhunter. His use of slow motion is enough to make the Wachowski brothers quiver in their boots. Many of my friends complained about the length (over 2 1\/2 hours) but these are the pop corn junkies i spoke of before. I was fortunate enough to catch this film at the cinema where the full glory of the cinematography was amazingly apparent.All in all this is a true masterpiece. Interlectual (which is rare in a film today), gripping, and truely truely fantastic in every sense of the word. This is by far Mann's best work to date and if he churns more gems out like this i will be a fan for many years to come.5\/5 ","genre":null},{"date":"6 October 2003","score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":"  After watching all of Michael Mann's movies i can say that he has never made a bad film.

I had to learn to jump start ambulances to get invalids to the dialysis machines. - Joan Cusack and Steve Martin, My Blue Heaven.There's a lot of fun to be found in My Blue Heaven, a simple little comedy with only good intentions. I find it almost impossible to dislike - it has little offensive material, it isn't a stupid, recycled movie packaged with marketable trimmings. Instead, it is a joyful little flick that knows it is no Oscar winner but still tries to entertain its audience. And it does. My Blue Heaven is pure heaven for anyone who appreciates fine comedy - it's a little bit wacky, a little bit goofy, and very, very funny.Steve Martin is perfectly cast as the wild and crazy Vincent Antonelli, a Mafia informer who has been entered into the Witness Protection Program. His wife wants no part of their new, cheery life in a suburban America so she leaves him early on. Rick Moranis is equally well-cast as Barney Coopersmith, the FBI agent assigned to protect Vinnie and make sure his new life is suitable to his comfort.Barney's wife has just left him, too. She complains that he is too anal-retentive. She even mentions that he has a technique for getting equal amounts of butter on his waffles. Meanwhile, Vinnie soon tires of his new life and resorts to crime - first little things, such as marking down prices on meat in the local grocery store - which results in the best single line in the entire film, when a perky employee greets Vinnie. His response is a four-letter-word that isn't nearly as (c)rude as it seems it would be at first. Soon he meets up with old partners and crime and they form a new crime syndicate - much to the chagrin of a female police officer named Hannah Stubbs (Joan Cusack), who seems to be the perfect match for Barney Coopersmith.Hannah is unable to prosecute Vinnie because he is a Federal Witness. At first she and Barney hate each other. Then they grow closer. Vinnie watches on with joyful interest. And what makes this movie so enjoyable, in part, is the chemistry between Martin and Moranis. It's their first film together since Parenthood. They're a good duo, and Martin is so out of character here you start to forget it's even him playing an Italian mobster. Compare Vincent Antonelli to Neal Page (Martin's character in Planes, Trains and Automobiles), and the difference in not only attitude but mannerisms and levels of intensity is clearly evident. Martin can play the middle-class American white male especially well, but this film clearly shows that he has not left his wacky background in such films as The Jerk far behind.My Blue Heaven came out the same year as Goodfellas (1990). It was impeccable timing - at the end of Goodfellas we are left with the penetrating image of Ray Liotta's character Henry Hill outside a suburban home in a cheery neighborhood which, remarkably, looks exactly like the neighborhood in My Blue Heaven. It could be argued that My Blue Heaven is an immediate sequel in some senses. Where Goodfellas left off My Blue Heaven starts - it just throws in some comedy. Which is why I don't understand its small impact when it first arrived in theaters. (Suffice to say, it sorta flopped.)I own this film on a VHS tape I purchased for $4.99 at Wal-Mart. I found it lying in the bottom of a discount video barrel with no-name titles. There are comedic gems that have gained respect over the years, and then there are comedic gems that have slipped by unnoticed. My Blue Heaven wasn't very noticed upon its release in 1990, the few critics who saw it seemed not to pay any attention to it. Funny how some of the most joyful comedies slip by.

The aliens hope to learn about the human soul in the hopes it will save there race from extinction.From there, the movie begins. As in The Matrix, a savior for the human race is chosen. In this film, it is not a nerdy computer hacker but a confused man (named John Murdock) who wakes up to find himself as a fugitive of the law and wanted for murder. This part is portrayed by Rufus Sewell. Rufus does a great job as the lead and would-be savior but the true performances come from the supporting cast....The first is Jennifer Connelly who plays Murdock's wife, a sexy club singer who's life is flipped upside-down as she despereately tries to patch up her crumbling marriage to Murdock.The second is Kiefer Sutherland who plays a Dr. Schreber, a dim-witted and crippled scientist who is forced night after night to edit people's personalities for the alien's experiments.Then there is William Hurt who plays Inspector Bumstead, a depressing detective who is still mourning over the loss of his lovely wife.The final is Richard O'Brien who plays Mr. Hand, one the dark, albino aliens who imprints Murdock's memories in his head in hopes of capturing Murdock.From there the movie takes off. It is filled with mystery, action and questions...tons of questions. Are the memories in your head your true memories? Who are you? What is your true purpose?The other brilliance of the film is the unbelievable setting which is a cross between the 1950s and the 1980s. From the saucy night club to the cheap hotel, to the upscale police station to the rundown theater. It reaks of Metropolis.The movie's story is stunning, the acting superb and the setting is to die for. Rent this film and watch it!

But the dullness is made worse by the director's technique of getting the actors to say their lines slowly after a hesitation (like in Eyes Wide Shut).The casting is quite good. I liked the actor who played Lady Lyndon's personal reverend. He looked like he was plucked from a period painting. Ryan O'Neil was good too, with a believable Irish accent.This isn't one you would want to watch twice, so I'd recommend renting it.

Davis was being raped and Sarandon shot the man to get him off of her. Thus the duo become victims of circumstance and sorry decision-making. They hit the road as fugitives from Arkansas and dodge FBI man Harvey Keitel and Davis' abusive husband (Christopher McDonald) along the way. They even get to meet a then-unknown Brad Pitt as a womanizing cowboy. Thelma & Louise is really fluff for the liberal American woman. When released it was hailed from every direction as being risk-taking and non-conformist. However the movie is really little more than smoke and mirrors. Sarandon outshines Davis throughout the movie and Keitel actually ends up being the most interesting character by the final act. Ridley Scott's odd direction yielded him an Oscar-nomination and screenwriter Callie Khouri actually picked up an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay back in 1991. More of a blockbuster than a deep-thinking cinematic product though. 4 stars out of 5.
