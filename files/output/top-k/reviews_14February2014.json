The main theme is the acceptance of death &#x97; not a light subject for a feel-good Hollywood movie, but it works well enough.

Another extended theme is the father-daughter bond.I found this to be a melancholic and slow movie. I was willing to go along with the Death walks among us conceit, but Bill was a little too quick to accept Joe for who he was. The heart attack scenes didn't impress it on me enough.Hopkins, Forlani, Harden and Tambor were quite good. Pitt was strongest in the scenes with the Jamaican woman.

William Powell was already an 'old hand' at crime, coming freshly from his Philo Vance series success; while Myrna Loy had been playing more in melodramas up to then - but director W.S. van Dyke, who personally chose her for the role, was convinced that she had a GREAT sense of humor as well. And how right he was...Nick Charles is a former 'tough guy' style private dick from New York (although there's not too much left of the original character that Dashiell Hammett had created in the novel which had just been released a few months earlier), who 'married money' (as he himself ironically points out from time to time, much to his wife's chagrin) in the shape of Nora, the daughter of a rich businessman, who nevertheless is a perfect match for him she loves adventure and crime and doesn't get scared easily - and most of all, she drinks almost as much as Nick himself... The movie was released just a little while after the end of the Prohibition, and so of course everybody could relish in excessive drinking parties even in an MGM movie, where they had always been rather careful about this subject as long as alcohol had been prohibited (in the novel, the story is set during the Prohibition days, and so Nick and Nora are of course often found in speakeasies, ignoring the law...); and the easing off of the horrible social effects of the Depression also shows in a generally carefree, almost childishly funny party atmosphere throughout the movie - even in the middle of a dark, mysterious murder case...Clyde Wynant, an eccentric inventor, has vanished all of a sudden; while his secretary and former lover Julia, who had stolen the bonds he had intended to give to his daughter for her wedding, is found dead in her apartment.

I just can't.The Alamo presents the story of the heroic last stand of some 180 Texas irregulars against the massed might of Santa Anna's Mexican army, featuring Wayne both as director and actor (playing Davy Crockett, one of the defenders at the siege.) It's full of great images, solid performances, and affecting scenes. Also, it's terribly long (even the edited version I saw runs over two-and-a-half hours) and weakened by a tendency toward preachiness and lazy sentiment.Is it entertaining? I say yes, albeit intermittently, even though it doesn't adhere to the facts and feels rather underbaked in the story department.

Yet The Alamo is the last film of Wayne's which deserves such opprobrium. The film soft-soaps the viciousness of Santa Anna, whose no-quarter approach to riot control did him in as an effective ruler, and sets up the title edifice as a kind of coming together of multi-ethnic harmony. Even given the context of legend-building, this plays way too good to be true.The script, by Wayne's favorite writer James Edward Grant, pushes buttons without mercy or subtlety. This is the film where Denver Pyle, as one of the Alamo's defenders, marvels about the Mexicans bent on the slaughter of him and his comrades Even when I was killin' 'em, I was proud of 'em.Wayne took a lousy part, a character already brilliantly defined on TV by Fess Parker, and did what he could with it. As director, he selflessly ceded the stage to his co-stars, especially Richard Widmark as a tough, no-nonsense Jim Bowie and Laurence Harvey as Col. William Travis, the most interesting character in the picture. Harvey, burdened somewhat by an on-and-off English accent, gives Travis a veneer that makes him likable, even as he plays loose with the facts in keeping his men in the fort. Harvey at least is clearly enjoying himself, and for that his scenes have real color and vim.Some reviewers here say the film is cheated when cut a half-hour from the version first released in roadshow form. Certainly what I see here felt compromised by the absence of a resolution to a story arc involving a bad-guy American named Emil Sand and the woman he seeks to pressure into marriage. But it wasn't like I wanted this movie longer.The finale at least is terrific. Call it Wild Bunch 1.0 for the way Wayne shoots the battle itself, all quick cuts and grisly deaths with hardly a dollop of sentiment. It's visceral filmmaking, and shows Wayne could shoot action, however lacking Widmark and others found his direction in terms of character development.Ultimately, The Alamo works okay as cinematic entertainment, aided greatly by William H. Clothier's cinematography which gives every shot that epic feeling that came so naturally in the 1960s and rarely thereafter. It's not entirely empty otherwise, Wayne's affable performance is on par with his later work and Grant manages to write some good dialogue here and there, like when Bowie learns the fate of his wife.

Which I did not.People who do not understand why the Paris of the moment when the film was made is used to represent a future dystopia should be condemned to never watching a film outside of the Mainstream ever again. The point is blindingly obvious dystopia is all around us. Using music and lighting and camera movement to represent that, rather than relying on triumphantly gaudy and expensive production design, shows that Godard is a filmmaker down to the tips of his toes. He learned so much from the American directors who had no recourse to expensive sets and had to use shadows and fog...I'm thinking of Lang on Man Hunt, Mann on G - Men. Of course, Ulmer on Detour, etc.All this is amazing. And there are great set pieces (the swimming pool, for example). And the use of the same couple of bars of music, over and over, is great, too.Look, I don't need to believe in the relationships and the ideas in Godard films in order to enjoy them. Karina and Constantine was perhaps a very inspired mismatch. And I've read and studied lots of Brecht. But Alphaville just doesn't SWING for me the way most of the others from this time do.

It does creak in places and the stagey elements will turn off a lot of those viewers who don't frequently watch older films. But it's undeniably a classic and I feel it still entertains, despite its flaws. The story, which I'm sure we're all familiar with by now, starts with Renfield (Dwight Frye) traveling to Transylvania to finalize the lease of Carfax Abbey in England to Count Dracula (Bela Lugosi). Once at the Count's castle, Renfield falls under his spell. When the ship they take to England arrives with everybody on board dead and drained of blood, Renfield is held responsible and committed to an asylum. But the real killer is centuries-old vampire Dracula, who now preys on the women of London. When Dracula sets his sights on Mina Seward (Helen Chandler) he arouses the suspicions of the distinguished Professor Van Helsing (Edward Van Sloan), who knows all about vampires and sets out to stop the evil Count.Classic Universal horror film that, along with Frankenstein, set off the 1930s horror boom as well as cementing the public image of Dracula for decades to come. The script owes as much, if not more, to the stage play than to Bram Stoker's original novel. It's a much more restrained film than you might expect considering it's about vampires. There are no fangs, no blood, and the stake-through-the-heart scene occurs offscreen. Even Renfield's depravities are only alluded to rather than shown. Tod Browning's direction is often stiff and receives a lot of deserved criticism. But there are some iconic scenes and images, helped in large part by the great cinematographer Karl Freund. Unsubstantiated reports are Freund actually directed a good deal of the movie, which may account for why sometimes the camera moves and provides for interesting shots while other times the camera is drearily static. Things are at their stagiest during the setbound scenes in London. Never is it worse than in the scene where David Manners' John Harker tries to shoo away an obviously fake bat (Look out, he'll get in your hair!). The scene is suppose to take place on a terrace but it's clearly a set with matte painting walls that poorly resemble the actual outdoors. It's one of the few scenes in the movie that even die-hard fans must chuckle a little over.Career-defining roles for Lugosi, Van Sloan, and Frye. Bela Lugosi's Dracula is the version by which all others are measured. Lugosi played the part on the stage and brings a level of theatricality to the role, hamming it up gloriously. His distinct way of delivering lines -- speaking slowly with his thick Hungarian accent and mid-sentence pauses -- would be often imitated over the years in a similar way to how people imitate William Shatner's line delivery today. Edward Van Sloan is the definitive Van Helsing. As much as I love Peter Cushing in the role, all vampire hunter roads lead to Van Sloan. Dwight Frye, another wonderful ham, is superb as the wild-eyed Renfield. Subtlety was never Frye's strong point and God bless him for it. David Manners and Helen Chandler are the film's weakest links, with overly affected performances that add to the criticisms of staginess.I caution everybody against watching the version with the new music score. Yes the film creaks at times and the lack of a music score doesn't help. But the version released in the '90s with the Phillip Glass score is just awful. The music is overbearing and very noticeably modern. It doesn't fit the movie at all and is more distracting than anything. So avoid that. But you should check out the Spanish language version, filmed at the same time as this one. While this filmed during the day, the Spanish version was filmed at night using the same sets and script, though its runtime is quite a bit longer. That version is often praised as being superior to this one. You can read my review on that film for my thoughts on it.

The icky factor is dialed to a 10, providing some effective moments of skin-crawling. In other words, Arachnophobia is a deliciously fun ride, with genuine thrills and legitimate laughs.The amusingly self-aware plot is that by unfortunate chance, a deadly Venezuelan spider was transported to a small town where the spiders quickly multiplied and begin killing various town residents. The nest is, rather coincidentally, located in the farm of arachno-phobic, Ross Jennings.It is so rare to see a film get this mix of comedy, chills, and thrills down so perfect. Never does one element seem to outweigh the other. The tongue-in-cheek delivery of the story is highly enjoyable, and there are some genuinely creepy-crawly scenes. All of this leads up to a thrilling (and chilling) climax that is fantastic fun.There is a lot of mastery in the build-up in this film. Spiders are often dancing around potential victims, tantalizing the audience with another gruesome death. Will it bite her? Will she notice it? We watch with morbid curiosity and a grin as we writhe with anticipation and (perhaps slightly twisted) delight. The spiders are nearly as creepy as they could possibly be. They're silent and quick. They can jump (which adds a whole new layer of terror). And some are quite large. We see them hide in food, and exit out of victim's nostrils. Arachnophobia creates a sense of paranoia that will stay with you long after the film has ended.And yet, the creepiness is kept from getting too nerve-wracking thanks to its self-aware attitude and campy spirit, which insures a fun time, even when you're chewing your nails away and intermittently brushing off your shoulder.Jeff Daniels as Ross Jennings isn't given as much to work with as some of the other cast members, but he makes for a likable lead. The real stand-out, however, is John Goodman as Delbert McClintock, who provides the biggest laughs of the film, and steals all of his scenes. He's woefully underused, however, as he appears in just a handful of short scenes. The supporting cast also has their share of funny bits, including Stuart Pankin, Roy Brocksmith, and Kathy Kinney.Trevor Jones' score is surprisingly fun. The cheesy and dated music (an unintended result that has come with age) adds to the fun, and the pleasant town melodies make the comic build-up to the spiders' reign even more chuckle-worthy.Arachnophobia is a surprisingly clever and smartly made movie. It provides a satisfying blend of comedy and suspense, coupled with solid performances and a hot heaping of camp. It's fun, it's reasonably creepy, and just a really good time.
