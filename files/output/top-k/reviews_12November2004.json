I can't. I just can't. I love it so so much, I can't explain it. I came across this movie by somewhat of an accident last year sometime. I did a Netflix search for The Mists of Avalon. No Mists of Avalon, but instead an Aiden Quinn movie called simply Avalon.

I watched the trailer, thought it looked good and put it on my queue list. It sat forever and ever, so I deleted it. Once again never giving it a second thought.Then 2 months ago I became very interested in the actor Tom Wood (Noah Newman from The Fugitive and U.S. Marshals and the adult Michael from this film.) I, of course, went to Netflix and did a search for him. Avalon, however did not show up on the list. I returned my attention to a list I had written with all of the movies he's made listed. I typed Avalon in the search box and sure enough, it was the same Avalon. I immediately put it in the queue and bumped it up to the top spot. A day or so later we received Avalon in the mail and I waisted no time in watching it. I was immediately in love with the characters and the way the family bonded together. My family is a lot like that, OK, we're not immigrants (oh somewhere down the line I'm sure we are, but that's not the point), we're not Jewish (we're in fact Missionary Baptists) and we don't live in a clump (ok, most of us do, but a few cousins and me and my parents live apart from the clump.).

The killings were too gruesome for me, which I understand were inserted on the behest of the studio after Carpenter had submitted a less gory, more atmospheric film. This is a shame, as I think the more left to the imagination, the spookier it would have been. I also think the ghosts looked more like badly dressed tramps. My biggest problem with it was the glaring plot errors and inconsistencies. Perhaps someone out there can prove me wrong, but this for me let the film down greatly - (SPOILERS BELOW)1. The DANE driftwood that the DJ took to her lighthouse began to drip water and spelt out 6 must die. At the end of the film when they group together in the church they refer to the fact that 6 must die, and count how many people have been killed so far. At no point has the DJ left the lighthouse or made this information known to anyone else, and it certainly wouldn't have been written in the diary, so how did they know?2. At the end when the DJ is warning the townspeople about the fog she gives a running commentary and tells everyone to go the church, as it's the only safe place. As only five people turn up at the church, are we to assume that either a) she has a very small audience, or b) the rest of the town is already dead? If it is the latter then more than six have died, and if it is neither, then is the fog not really that deadly after all?3. The story is that the original six conspired to sink the ship so that they could use the money to build the town. The diary says that they recovered the money from the wreck. So the whole film is based on the premise that the town was built on blood money. So how come at the end the vicar finds a solid gold cross behind the wall, and says the money was melted down into that? Why would they use it all to make a gold cross that would be hidden, when they needed it to make the town? Did they not need it to make the town? If so why bother with the whole sinking the ship, killing the lepers thing in the first place?Now you may think I'm just being picky, but these sorts of things bother me and prevent me from enjoying a film. Does anyone out there have the answers? Apart from that I didn't think it was too bad. I think Halloween and Assault on Precinct 13 were better though. John Carpenter has recently announced that Hollywood will be remaking The Fog with him as Producer. Perhaps these plot errors will be fixed! And the ghosts will look more scary!

It's even a step down from the disastrous Jaws 2, and yet another insult to Spielberg's original, which remains one of the most enduring thrillers ever made. But the Bottom 100? At the time of this writing, Jaws 3 stands at #71 on the IMDb's list of the 100 worst movies ever made, as judged by us, the users. While the movie was certainly ridiculous, it is NOT the 71st worst movie ever made. Maybe this is just a numbers thing, but if movies like Nightmare Weekend and Graveyard Shift (1987) are not on that list, the Jaws 3 definitely does not deserve to be.What it DOES deserve, however, is a good shellacking for being such a mess. Jaws 3. interestingly enough, continues more on Jaws 2 than the original Jaws. Jaws 2 at least had the sense to go for creating some of the tension and atmosphere that made the original such a success, while things like the shark turning into a run-of-the-mill movie monster were merely by-products. Jaws 3 takes that descent of the shark from predator to monster and runs with THAT. You can see some of the budding ideas that led to Deep Blue Sea (another stupid shark movie) in Jaws 3, as the shark takes on abilities to roar, swim backwards, swim through the reinforced glass and into the underwater control room, hide itself, and basically hunt like a human. The shark acts so unnatural in this movie that by the end I wouldn't have been surprised if it pulled out a shotgun and started shooting at people.On the plus side, they at least avoided something stupid like have the shark smile, but then again they couldn't resist having a dolphin frantically shaking it's head 'no' while a couple of diving humans search the sunken Spanish Galleon, bringing themselves dangerously close to the shark. Please. It's things like this that earn the movie worse ratings from the people than it deserves. Indeed, at least one person has pointed out a goof that's not really a goof. When the tour guide is leading people out of the Undersea Kingdom, it's not the green screen set that you can clearly see, but simply the outline of the portion of the Kingdom that they had been standing in.What no one has pointed out, however, is that when they were loading up poison to shoot at the shark, one person fills a syringe and then squirts out probably half of the poison that had been pulled into the syringe, wasting half of it and promptly demonstrating a massive lack of understanding of why that's done in the first place. You point the syringe straight up, flick it to release any air bubbles from the sides, then squeeze until it squirts to make sure there is no air in it. In humans, a single air bubble could mean a stroke and death, in the shark, the more ways to kill it the merrier. Besides, the syringe was held at an angle, and you can clearly see a gigantic pocket of air in it. I've never given an injection in my life and even I know that.(spoilers) In the movie's defense, at least it had a mildly interesting premise. Mike Brody, from Jaws 2, has grown into a strapping young man and works, fittingly enough, at Sea World. He's got this girlfriend with whom he has a goofy movie relationship, she's the dolphin trainer. Much of the first half of the movie is dedicated to showing a couple of dolphins do a lot of jumps and flips, then they disappear completely from the film during the shark portion, and then are cheered at the end for still being alive. One no name dolphin is munched during the course of the movie, but it appears in the movie only long enough to be eaten so it doesn't matter.The movie is probably now best known for being the first, and only, Jaws movie released in 3-D, a cute effect which does not translate well to video. Given the logistics of providing a home video in 3-D, they had no choice but to remove the 3-D effects and release it as a normal film. I really would like to have seen it in 3-D, because it is clear that the filmmakers put more stock in this effect than anything else in the movie. The 3-D scenes stick out like sore thumbs, not just because the movie stops completely in its tracks every time one arrives so that it can linger on screen and audience members can reach out in front of them and try to touch things, but because these scenes on video are so badly computer generated that it's almost funny. And they were right to put a lot of stock into the 3-D effects, because as is now obvious, without them the movie falls on its face as soon as the opening credits. In theaters, these credits may have jumped off the screen and wowed audiences. On video, they do nothing but cover up the water ski pyramid that you're trying to watch. Initially meant to be the first oohs and aahs of the movie, now they simply get in the way of one of the only impressive things in the entire movie.Another stupid thing from Jaws 2 that is added upon here is that Jaws 2 was a stupid teen horror movie, and this one goes for the same cast of stupid teenagers. Granted, they're all older than the kids in the Friday the 13th and Nightmare on Elm Street movies, but consider the bar scene. They entertain themselves by getting drunk and then trying to push each other over in ludicrous games like Standoff, and even worse, consider the scene where Lea Thompson's character, Kelly, is wooed by Sean Brody, who tricks her in a game of Standoff, takes her back to his table, and proceeds to hit on her in the most stupefying way imaginable. The only thing more shocking about how un-charming he is is that Kelly just devours it. With flirting like that going on, we don't need a shark.

It's even a step down from the disastrous Jaws 2, and yet another insult to Spielberg's original, which remains one of the most enduring thrillers ever made. But the Bottom 100? At the time of this writing, Jaws 3 stands at #71 on the IMDb's list of the 100 worst movies ever made, as judged by us, the users. While the movie was certainly ridiculous, it is NOT the 71st worst movie ever made. Maybe this is just a numbers thing, but if movies like Nightmare Weekend and Graveyard Shift (1987) are not on that list, the Jaws 3 definitely does not deserve to be.What it DOES deserve, however, is a good shellacking for being such a mess. Jaws 3. interestingly enough, continues more on Jaws 2 than the original Jaws. Jaws 2 at least had the sense to go for creating some of the tension and atmosphere that made the original such a success, while things like the shark turning into a run-of-the-mill movie monster were merely by-products. Jaws 3 takes that descent of the shark from predator to monster and runs with THAT. You can see some of the budding ideas that led to Deep Blue Sea (another stupid shark movie) in Jaws 3, as the shark takes on abilities to roar, swim backwards, swim through the reinforced glass and into the underwater control room, hide itself, and basically hunt like a human. The shark acts so unnatural in this movie that by the end I wouldn't have been surprised if it pulled out a shotgun and started shooting at people.On the plus side, they at least avoided something stupid like have the shark smile, but then again they couldn't resist having a dolphin frantically shaking it's head 'no' while a couple of diving humans search the sunken Spanish Galleon, bringing themselves dangerously close to the shark. Please. It's things like this that earn the movie worse ratings from the people than it deserves. Indeed, at least one person has pointed out a goof that's not really a goof. When the tour guide is leading people out of the Undersea Kingdom, it's not the green screen set that you can clearly see, but simply the outline of the portion of the Kingdom that they had been standing in.What no one has pointed out, however, is that when they were loading up poison to shoot at the shark, one person fills a syringe and then squirts out probably half of the poison that had been pulled into the syringe, wasting half of it and promptly demonstrating a massive lack of understanding of why that's done in the first place. You point the syringe straight up, flick it to release any air bubbles from the sides, then squeeze until it squirts to make sure there is no air in it. In humans, a single air bubble could mean a stroke and death, in the shark, the more ways to kill it the merrier. Besides, the syringe was held at an angle, and you can clearly see a gigantic pocket of air in it. I've never given an injection in my life and even I know that.(spoilers) In the movie's defense, at least it had a mildly interesting premise. Mike Brody, from Jaws 2, has grown into a strapping young man and works, fittingly enough, at Sea World. He's got this girlfriend with whom he has a goofy movie relationship, she's the dolphin trainer. Much of the first half of the movie is dedicated to showing a couple of dolphins do a lot of jumps and flips, then they disappear completely from the film during the shark portion, and then are cheered at the end for still being alive. One no name dolphin is munched during the course of the movie, but it appears in the movie only long enough to be eaten so it doesn't matter.The movie is probably now best known for being the first, and only, Jaws movie released in 3-D, a cute effect which does not translate well to video. Given the logistics of providing a home video in 3-D, they had no choice but to remove the 3-D effects and release it as a normal film. I really would like to have seen it in 3-D, because it is clear that the filmmakers put more stock in this effect than anything else in the movie. The 3-D scenes stick out like sore thumbs, not just because the movie stops completely in its tracks every time one arrives so that it can linger on screen and audience members can reach out in front of them and try to touch things, but because these scenes on video are so badly computer generated that it's almost funny. And they were right to put a lot of stock into the 3-D effects, because as is now obvious, without them the movie falls on its face as soon as the opening credits. In theaters, these credits may have jumped off the screen and wowed audiences. On video, they do nothing but cover up the water ski pyramid that you're trying to watch. Initially meant to be the first oohs and aahs of the movie, now they simply get in the way of one of the only impressive things in the entire movie.Another stupid thing from Jaws 2 that is added upon here is that Jaws 2 was a stupid teen horror movie, and this one goes for the same cast of stupid teenagers. Granted, they're all older than the kids in the Friday the 13th and Nightmare on Elm Street movies, but consider the bar scene. They entertain themselves by getting drunk and then trying to push each other over in ludicrous games like Standoff, and even worse, consider the scene where Lea Thompson's character, Kelly, is wooed by Sean Brody, who tricks her in a game of Standoff, takes her back to his table, and proceeds to hit on her in the most stupefying way imaginable. The only thing more shocking about how un-charming he is is that Kelly just devours it. With flirting like that going on, we don't need a shark.

He is arrested, and when released finds himself hounded by a pair of inept police officers around the town for a few days. After outsmarting them (in one of cinema's most delightful moments &#150; ever) Axel gets hooked up with an old friend and manages to roam the streets looking for clues &#150; which, of course, he finds very easily.Before this film Eddie Murphy had starred in one film that had launched his name into Hollywood 48 HRS. But by all reasonable comparisons this is a much, much better film, and it's also much, much funnier, too. What's most refreshing is that it doesn't fall back upon the stereotypes of African-Americans inherent in so many mainstream motion pictures &#150; the role of Axel Foley was originally written for Sylvester Stallone (who was actually attached to star early on in pre-production before dropping out of the project) and it's quite clear that Foley was intended as a white character. Although massive rewrites were employed only two weeks before shooting, script flaws can still be spotted &#150; the heroine of the story is a white businesswoman, for example, and we expect some sort of sexual tension between them but there is none. We begin to question the very presence of the female lead because in essence it leads nowhere. We can imagine how it might have developed into a love story, but Murphy works against the flow, awkwardly treating her as nothing more than a friend.These sorts of things sometimes bring out the occasional odd touches in the film &#150; ironically they unintentionally set the film apart from other such movies of the genre because it's not typical in any sense. Sure, it has the routine shoot-outs but there is no romance subplot, no pointless racial comparisons (more of which would be seen in the two sequels), etc. The movie greatly benefits from this because it seems so fresh, and far more believable &#150; after all, rarely are romances developed in two days. The action genre always seems to end with the hero sending off the crooks to jail, and finally getting a long-awaited kiss from the leading lady. Beverly Hills Cop, to its credit, manages to avoid this and the result is a far more enjoyable film, even if most of its sequences are far from being 100% realistic.The film's director, Martin Brest, has a clear handle on the buddy genre and would go on to direct the immensely successful Robert De Niro \/ Charles Grodin road-buddies-comedy Midnight Run, one of the most popular (and best) of the genre. Beverly Hills Cop works just as well &#150; it's funny when it needs to be, thrilling when it wants to be, and features a stellar lead performance by Murphy in his most unusual role.Murphy is the driving force behind the film, presenting us with a truly likable character &#150; the most likable character he's ever played, as a matter of fact. Axel is unorthodox but a generally good guy &#150; Murphy is sometimes typecast into playing roles similar to that of which he played in 48 HRS. (being the loud, obnoxious racist who's got it all together), but here he plays someone we actually want to root for. At one point in the film he manages to get a couple of police officers in trouble with their superior &#150; but he takes all the blame, and actually fabricates a lie wherein they were heroes doing their job, despite the fact that they were all actually hanging out at a strip club.

","genre":"Action, Comedy, Crime"},{"date":"12 November 2004","score":"8 out of 10 people found the following review useful","review":" Although I agree that this is a wonderful film (if a bit overlong), and is worth watching, I feel that, in his effort to make another epic and trying to match his incomparable Lawrence Of Arabia and The Bridge On The River Kwai , David Lean missed out on a more in-depth and meaningful plot.The novel, is more or less, a love story that takes place during the Russian Revolution, and the turmoil that this event inflicted on the human spirit. Boris Pasternak was basically calling things as he saw and experienced them, since he witnessed this upheaval. While the movie is gorgeous and fascinating to look at, and the music is superb, adding to the haunting quality of the story and the characters, the film fails to become a more intimate look at the people's lives, and therefore is missing some of the crucial elements of the book. Not to demean the late Robert Bolt, who was a very gifted screenwriter, and he deserved the Oscar he received, but he didn't (or perhaps, couldn't) recreate the labor of love that Pasternak penned.It was wonderful to see Julie Christie and Tom Courtenay together again on-screen, as they had such a smashing success with John Schlesinger's delicious Billy Liar (1963). However, the love story of Lara and Pasha, so sweetly detailed in the novel, is relegated to pretty much a back story or a minor plot element, perhaps to capitalize on Lara's destructive affair with Victor Komorovsky (the late and wonderfully devious Rod Steiger), and her upcoming, face-to-face encounter with Yuri Zhivago (Omar Sharif). I saw the movie before I read the novel, but even then, I felt very sorry for the character of Pasha, because we really were not given a lot of insight into him, or what it was that turned him from such an adoring lover to Lara, to the brutal Strelinkov, and since his character dies off-screen, I felt cheated out of a meaningful conclusion of that storyline. I was so touched by the book's information about their affection for one another, and the way the book had Zhivago and Pasha meet and discuss the love of both their lives - Lara. The 2002 Masterpiece Theatre TV miniseries starring Hans Matheson, Keira Knightley and Kris Marshall was much more faithful to the novel, and presented something closer to the full story.Julie Christie is always lovely and magnetic, and she obviously has an eye for great material. Her electric blue eyes and sensitive, full lips often say more that the viewer has heard her say.

She was excellent in Tony Richardson's A Taste Of Honey, and you have to wonder why she didn't have more of a career. Watch for the late Klaus Kinski in a brief but very effective portrayal of a man who becomes a prisoner of forced labor - his scenes on the train are riveting. Jack MacGowran has an interesting little part as well. Those 60s hairstyles do say something about the fashion then, even in a period film. You have to love to hate the despicable Komorovsky, who thought he was God's gift to women or something (and in the miniseries, Sam Neill is just as repulsively right in the role). Sharif's portrayal of Zhivago is impressive, but doesn't it seem like he is always brooding or crying?It has its flaws, but it is still romantic and I am still entranced with it, especially, for some strange reason, during Christmas.

I saw the movie before I read the novel, but even then, I felt very sorry for the character of Pasha, because we really were not given a lot of insight into him, or what it was that turned him from such an adoring lover to Lara, to the brutal Strelinkov, and since his character dies off-screen, I felt cheated out of a meaningful conclusion of that storyline.

Now here's a film that seems to generate a wide spectrum of reviews.As for my take on this landmark motion picture, I have to admit that I will always be able to reflect on it in its original context.In 1982, TRON (along with Blade Runner) was nothing short of breathtaking. And, although it was originally panned by critics, those who have taken the time to look closer, have noticed that there is more to this film than there first seems to be.One of TRON's greatest strengths lies in its extensive use of parallelism. There is the world of the user (almost a god or demigod motif), contrasted with the world of the programs (very much a metaphor for our world). And, just to enhance this metaphor, Dillinger's helicopter is shown with neon-red lines, and the final fade to black is preceded with a time-lapse of the city &#150; suggesting data running along traces.The obvious parallels are with the use of the same actor for each character's counterparts in the digital world. Flynn and Clu, Alan and Tron, Laura and Yori, Gibbs and Dumont, Dillinger and Sark.However, we see a number of other characters show up here and there, in more subtle form For example, there's Sark's second in command on the bridge of the carrier. He shows up earlier in the film as Peter &#150; the suit who was watching Dillinger's office. Then there's RAM's human counterpart asking Alan if he can have some of his popcorn. I find it surprising that many are critical of the 'unbelievable' aspect of this film. However, never is the audience expected to believe that this is the way the computer world really works or that a person could ever be zapped into a computer. In fact, to allude to the type of story that the audience is being presented with, TRON does a near-quote of Alice In Wonderland, with 'Stranger and stranger.' Perhaps Kevin Flynn fell down the rabbit hole&#133;. And &#150; for those who think TRON is a Disney film &#150; watch the production notes and you'll discover that this is not a Disney film (although they did fund it).Of most obvious interest is the fact that TRON pushed the computer graphics technology of the time to its limits and beyond. And &#150; despite many who have said that its graphics are primitive, they're confusing resolution with texture-mapping. The truth is, the number of colours displayed and the resolution shown in the computer-generated components in TRON is higher than most desktop displays &#150; even today. To output to film with the level of sharpness and smooth gradients seen in TRON, you'd need at least 24 or 32-bit colour, with a horizontal resolution of approximately 3000 to 4000 pixels. On top of that, it was the first film to use transparency in 3D CGI (the solar-sailor simulation). To my knowledge, texture-mapping didn't exist in 1982. Fortunately, the lack of texture mapping works well with the stylized look of the film's 'world inside the machine.'As a film, TRON is definitely both unique and entertaining. And, for those who are visual in nature, it's full of splendid eye-candy. The design work is top-rate, and is best appreciated when viewed on film. I recall watching this movie when it first came out in 1982, and have to say that it was nothing short of total immersion. Unfortunately, most of the modern transfers of this film have been pretty rough (with the exception of the out-of-print Laserdisc box-set).The plot for TRON is actually quite simple. Despite this simplicity, it is cleverly used for the purpose of -- hopefully &#150; making the audience think about our world, and how it may relate to some 'higher world.' If we are programs, then who are our users? Is there a level up from us, and do they know all the answers? There is certainly a metaphysical angle to TRON, which the audience can ether pay attention to, or disregard in favour of the simple thrill of watching Light Cycles square off against each other on the Game Grid.Many elements are combined in this film the gladiatorial film, the exodus, the revolution, the sentient AI, the battle of good vs. evil, and &#150; of course &#150; the almost prophetic depiction of the computer industry. Encom and Ed Dillinger are very much parallels to real themes that took place in the computer industry in the years that followed the release of TRON. These themes are very much repeated in more recent trilogy of films. I think the actual name for the Light Cycle game that Flynn mentions will give you a clue as to which trilogy I'm referring to.Finally, there's Kevin Flynn.

Over the years, I have actually known computer-industry hot-shots who are remarkably similar to Flynn. He made the character believable. And, this carries over to the film itself. No matter how much of a leap you're expected to make when approached with a script or screenplay, be compelling. Jeff Bridges and David Warner do exactly this. TRON is a movie that really entertains. I like to think of it as a big small movie. One that was definitely ambitious and is presented in 'glossy' and vivid wide-screen, yet has a sort of nice-light-snack kind of feel to it. It's a movie with a great deal of replay value, and one with compelling characters.

I have often caught various scenes on TV but never sat down and watched it since first viewing long ago. My opinion remains the same. I'm a big fan of Eddie Murphy, a pretty big fan of Dan Aykroyd, and in general '80s comedies and SNL -- but this one is a bit too long (over 120 mins, uncut and unedited w\/ commercials on television) -- it does have some very funny sequences and in particular the beginning is great but after that it sort of goes downhill. I thought the plot was incredibly weak and a bit too contrived -- Aykroyd's sudden complete loss of...everything was wholly unbelievable. I suppose it could be somewhat believable if not for the fact that Eddie Murphy suddenly replaces him and no one else seems to notice, or care. No business colleagues notice what is going on, etc. Then there's the scene where Aykroyd is walking by the restaurant and sees them all inside. He HAD to know what was going on when he saw Don Ameche with Eddie Murphy. He had to know they had set him up. Why didn't he just go into the restaurant and confront them?Yeah, it's just a comedy or just a movie but there's a difference between suspension of disbelief (which I don't mind at all -- I own Commando!) and being downright stupid. It's the little stuff like this I don't like. It starts out as a fairly realistic comedy but is waaay too silly and over-the-top at times. (E.g. the guy getting put in with a gorilla - funny for a slapstick like Naked Gun, perhaps, but not for an otherwise realistic comedy.) It would at least be fun if it weren't so long! There are long gaps were nothing really happens. Many punchlines are clearly supposed to be funny, but aren't. There's an entire scene where Murphy is being given instructions about how Wall Street works and it goes on for about two minutes, before he says You two sound like a coupl'a bookies to me. It's supposed to be the punchline to the scene, but it takes so long getting to it, and frankly, it just isn't very funny. Eddie Murphy is usually good at creating likable characters, or at least funny ones, but his character here seemed to just disappear and reappear so often I never really felt as if I was getting to know him -- he seemed more like a co-star. Dan Aykroyd gives a much better performance in general (or at least he has better material to work with in regards to his character).I prefer Beverly Hills Cop (my favorite Eddie performance), The Blues Brothers, Coming to America (with a clever reference to Trading Places) and even the mediocre (but entirely watchable and enjoyable) Great Outdoors to this. Trading Places is OK but certainly not the classic many seem to think it is. It's too long with too many unfunny scenes, the plot is a bit too unbelievable to take seriously, the characters are all over the place and this all creates a cold distance -- it's hard for me to warm up to the movie, I guess.

I thought the plot was incredibly weak and a bit too contrived -- Aykroyd's sudden complete loss of...everything was wholly unbelievable. I suppose it could be somewhat believable if not for the fact that Eddie Murphy suddenly replaces him and no one else seems to notice, or care. No business colleagues notice what is going on, etc. Then there's the scene where Aykroyd is walking by the restaurant and sees them all inside. He HAD to know what was going on when he saw Don Ameche with Eddie Murphy. He had to know they had set him up. Why didn't he just go into the restaurant and confront them?Yeah, it's just a comedy or just a movie but there's a difference between suspension of disbelief (which I don't mind at all -- I own Commando!) and being downright stupid. It's the little stuff like this I don't like. It starts out as a fairly realistic comedy but is waaay too silly and over-the-top at times. (E.g. the guy getting put in with a gorilla - funny for a slapstick like Naked Gun, perhaps, but not for an otherwise realistic comedy.) It would at least be fun if it weren't so long! There are long gaps were nothing really happens. Many punchlines are clearly supposed to be funny, but aren't. There's an entire scene where Murphy is being given instructions about how Wall Street works and it goes on for about two minutes, before he says You two sound like a coupl'a bookies to me. It's supposed to be the punchline to the scene, but it takes so long getting to it, and frankly, it just isn't very funny. Eddie Murphy is usually good at creating likable characters, or at least funny ones, but his character here seemed to just disappear and reappear so often I never really felt as if I was getting to know him -- he seemed more like a co-star. Dan Aykroyd gives a much better performance in general (or at least he has better material to work with in regards to his character).I prefer Beverly Hills Cop (my favorite Eddie performance), The Blues Brothers, Coming to America (with a clever reference to Trading Places) and even the mediocre (but entirely watchable and enjoyable) Great Outdoors to this. Trading Places is OK but certainly not the classic many seem to think it is. It's too long with too many unfunny scenes, the plot is a bit too unbelievable to take seriously, the characters are all over the place and this all creates a cold distance -- it's hard for me to warm up to the movie, I guess.

From the very first frame I was captivated by this film, and very interested in it. Then after about five minutes of watching, I realized how slow it was moving; Fine, I thought, it'll probably pick up later on. But it didn't. The film stays in the same uncompromisingly slow pace for the entire runtime which is about three hours(more or less, depending on which cut\/version you see). That's OK, don't get me wrong, but it brings the movie down. The film is epic, and truly astounding. It's a shame that it's so long and slow. The plot is great. The acting is very good, and great in some cases(for the most part, actually). The film contains a multitude of interesting, well-developed characters... but maybe that's part of the problem; there are too many of them. By the end of the film, I found myself being able to keep up with who was who, and as the credits came on, I couldn't really remember any of the names(though that may have something to do with them being in Japanese). The film has plenty of good dialog, though several of the characters spout lines that sound like they come from fortune cookies, but given just a little thought, they are quite profound. The film is called the first actual action film, due to the use of many plot points that have later ended up being clichés. The film has so much going for it, but at the end, I found myself barely paying attention. Maybe the film is too long for its own good... maybe I have a too short attention spam to fully enjoy the film(which is said to be a masterpiece, which I definitely won't argue with)... I don't know. In the end, after carefully going over all of the pros and cons of the film, I find myself rating it a nearly perfect 9\/10. Too many low points to it to merit a perfect 10, but far too many high points to rate it any lower, even if I didn't particularly care for the last part of the movie(which probably has more to do with my attention spam than the content of that part of the movie). The cinematography is excellent. The film is very, very well-done overall, but seems a little too long and slow, and is hurt(in any other part of the world) by the very obvious Japanese culture\/nature of the film, which is a little hard to accept, especially for us Westerners. It is a great film, though, and I can't argue with its placement on the top 250 best films of all time here on IMDb(it's #5 as I'm writing this). As a final note; to anyone out there who want to see the movie but are worried about violent content everything is only implied. Much like Hitchcock, Kurosawa obviously realized the effect of only implying violence, and as a result, most people can watch the film. Most people will probably enjoy (at least) parts of it, but I fear few will watch the whole thing through. Since I barely did so myself, I can't really say anything to keep you watching all the way through to the end; but I will say that the film is visually impressive, contains some great acting, some humane and credible characters that the audience will be able to sympathize and identify with. I recommend the film to just about anyone who is interested in watching it. However, if there are action\/Samurai fans out there, craving for fight scenes and Katana action, I will say this; Look elsewhere. This has very little of such, and what there is, is only implied.

Gone is the trademark mysterious hero and in its place is an ex gunman who made his peace when he met his wife. Eastwood has transcended traditional entertainment to storytelling craftsmanship. He delivers rich characters with deep rooted problems inextricably linked to the villains of the story. Refusing to wither and die away, style has been perfectly adapted with age thus ensuring his maturation into a true Hollywood legend.Besides his now distinctive storytelling, there are numerous factors that make this a landmark Western. The ensemble cast could not have been stronger and there were no weak performances. The soundtrack accentuates the intended atmosphere of the director. A single detracting factor I could find only just qualifies as such. Munny's whimsical lines seemed a little contrived at times. They droned on like pale attempts to capture the Western era. But this is a consequence of the fact that they were more to do with the character of William Munny. He is after all a reformed killer with a now passive approach to people. Given this fact and also that it may have been distracting since it was so out of sync with what we are used to seeing from Eastwood, I still have to list it as a demerit on the account it slightly jerked me out of the story.Hollywood producers have to satisfy audience preferences if investments are going to accrue profits. It is the nature of the beast. The action and more specifically the Western genre will stick to tried and tested formulas in order to guarantee audience acceptance. But every so often you get people who as a natural consequence of their unique character appeal are able to deliver a story that is outside these understandably restrictive boundaries. Eastwood is a cool individualist who normally plays characters who are not team players and do it their own way. His own way this time is to give the western genre a real story oozing characterization. A sort of ballad for the bad guy.The ballads tune provides the story with a sad, introspective mood, within the opening and closing scenes. The opening scene depicts Munny in his new found life. He is cured of his wicked ways, helped by his dear, departed wife. But men are not willing to forgive or forget his monstrous deeds and in the final scenes he is who he has to be. Such is the sorrowful life of William Munny.Westerns are typified by clearly defined goodies and baddies, but this is definitely not the case here. Eastwood and Freeman play reformed killers who find circumstances drawing them once again to their evil ways. But the older and wiser men now realize the value of life and come face to face with their troubled consciences. This is unlike their naïve, young partner who is attracted to the bravado image of the killer and relishes taking a man's life. This moral issue is virtually taboo for the classic western which glamorizes the lawlessness and the hero attraction of the gunslinger. This is also why in my view no-one besides Eastwood should have handled this movie.Then we have the juiciest character of the movie superbly played by Gene Hackman worthy of the weight of every micro granule of his Oscar. He is the epitome of every hard-line lawman that ever was. The misguidance of the so called righteously empowered, swinging the hammer against evil for good. Hackman must have salivated when he read the script since there was obvious relish in his performance. All the better for the movie, and of course for Eastwood at the Oscars. By far the best performance and the others were good further underlining the talent of the man.The antagonist of the movie is almost always the most complex and thus most interesting to analyze. His vain attempts at carpentry are his way of trying to appear to be a good man. There is purity in building ones own home and it is this wholesomeness that he wishes to capture. In that way his fellow citizens will see him as a simple man only wanting to lead a righteous life. But his inability as a carpenter is indicative of his depravity. He cannot be a good man. The source of his drive is anger and hatred. It is through this failing that we realize he cannot escape who he is.Indeed it was not only the power of the script that gave the audience a spellbinding climax, but the talents of the actors. The actors' characterizations deliver the audience a spellbinding climax. It is only through Hackman's performance that we not only acknowledge his ending as inevitable, but also as deserving. We saw him as a man who virtually thought that he was righteously empowered to rid the earth of Munny and his kind What he thought was an honorable task was one rather of abuse and suppression. He became the baddie in the eyes of the audience and it is he who the audience wants to see justice served upon. Munny was so weak throughout the movie that the eruption of his evil ways captured the interest of the audience. He transformed into the Eastwood of old &#150; the anti hero with a far more malevolent presence. Never could we have sensed this hatred and evil that we now see in William Munny. It is now that the frivolity of his mannerisms that I touched on in the beginning adds to the story as it helps to accentuate the turn in character. He is now only a killer, in it neither for money or fame as the writer nearly finds out to his tragic detriment.Those who have only seen his Westerns of old or the 'Dirty Harry' movies may enter the cinema with expectations of such like will either be disappointed or pleasantly surprised. It is the atypical western and an unfamiliar portrayal by Eastwood. But I believe that most people will have the latter reaction. The differences are their strengths helped by the fact that it was a superbly crafted movie with a meaningful story and thought provoking lessons for our heroes and villains. Eastwood was directly suited to the roles that we identify him with, but it is exactly because of this suitability that he eases into the role of Munny. No mellowing with age, no identification with the mainstream, he has always done it his way, and he is so good that any way could be his way.

Gone is the trademark mysterious hero and in its place is an ex gunman who made his peace when he met his wife. Eastwood has transcended traditional entertainment to storytelling craftsmanship. He delivers rich characters with deep rooted problems inextricably linked to the villains of the story. Refusing to wither and die away, style has been perfectly adapted with age thus ensuring his maturation into a true Hollywood legend.Besides his now distinctive storytelling, there are numerous factors that make this a landmark Western. The ensemble cast could not have been stronger and there were no weak performances. The soundtrack accentuates the intended atmosphere of the director. A single detracting factor I could find only just qualifies as such. Munny's whimsical lines seemed a little contrived at times. They droned on like pale attempts to capture the Western era. But this is a consequence of the fact that they were more to do with the character of William Munny. He is after all a reformed killer with a now passive approach to people. Given this fact and also that it may have been distracting since it was so out of sync with what we are used to seeing from Eastwood, I still have to list it as a demerit on the account it slightly jerked me out of the story.Hollywood producers have to satisfy audience preferences if investments are going to accrue profits. It is the nature of the beast. The action and more specifically the Western genre will stick to tried and tested formulas in order to guarantee audience acceptance. But every so often you get people who as a natural consequence of their unique character appeal are able to deliver a story that is outside these understandably restrictive boundaries. Eastwood is a cool individualist who normally plays characters who are not team players and do it their own way. His own way this time is to give the western genre a real story oozing characterization. A sort of ballad for the bad guy.The ballads tune provides the story with a sad, introspective mood, within the opening and closing scenes. The opening scene depicts Munny in his new found life. He is cured of his wicked ways, helped by his dear, departed wife. But men are not willing to forgive or forget his monstrous deeds and in the final scenes he is who he has to be. Such is the sorrowful life of William Munny.Westerns are typified by clearly defined goodies and baddies, but this is definitely not the case here. Eastwood and Freeman play reformed killers who find circumstances drawing them once again to their evil ways. But the older and wiser men now realize the value of life and come face to face with their troubled consciences. This is unlike their naïve, young partner who is attracted to the bravado image of the killer and relishes taking a man's life. This moral issue is virtually taboo for the classic western which glamorizes the lawlessness and the hero attraction of the gunslinger. This is also why in my view no-one besides Eastwood should have handled this movie.Then we have the juiciest character of the movie superbly played by Gene Hackman worthy of the weight of every micro granule of his Oscar. He is the epitome of every hard-line lawman that ever was. The misguidance of the so called righteously empowered, swinging the hammer against evil for good. Hackman must have salivated when he read the script since there was obvious relish in his performance. All the better for the movie, and of course for Eastwood at the Oscars. By far the best performance and the others were good further underlining the talent of the man.The antagonist of the movie is almost always the most complex and thus most interesting to analyze. His vain attempts at carpentry are his way of trying to appear to be a good man. There is purity in building ones own home and it is this wholesomeness that he wishes to capture. In that way his fellow citizens will see him as a simple man only wanting to lead a righteous life. But his inability as a carpenter is indicative of his depravity. He cannot be a good man. The source of his drive is anger and hatred. It is through this failing that we realize he cannot escape who he is.Indeed it was not only the power of the script that gave the audience a spellbinding climax, but the talents of the actors. The actors' characterizations deliver the audience a spellbinding climax. It is only through Hackman's performance that we not only acknowledge his ending as inevitable, but also as deserving. We saw him as a man who virtually thought that he was righteously empowered to rid the earth of Munny and his kind What he thought was an honorable task was one rather of abuse and suppression. He became the baddie in the eyes of the audience and it is he who the audience wants to see justice served upon.
