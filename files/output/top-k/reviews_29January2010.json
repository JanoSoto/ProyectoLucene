It's weird, I've seen so many of his movies, but I never saw Last Action Hero. They said that this movie was a huge flop and got nothing but bad reviews, so maybe that's why my parents never showed me this movie. But I decided to go ahead and watch it on my own and you know something? I loved it! Sure, it doesn't come without flaws, but I really enjoyed this movie and don't understand it's bad reputation. I think it's a spoof on action movies and how silly they are when you compare to what real life is. When you watch an action movie like Commando, Die Hard or First Blood, they take you out of our world and into an exciting one where the good guys always win and all is well with the world. Last Action Hero takes a clever idea where we have every action cliché and it's pointed out and makes for a very funny story and some comedic situations that are a good homage to our favorite action movies.Danny Madigan is magically transported into the surreal world of an action film featuring his fictional idol, Jack Slater; Slater is the hero of the Jack Slater film series, a fearless LAPD detective. Nick, a movie theater projector, invites Danny to a private screening of Jack Slater IV and gives him a magic ticket. Before the movie, Nick tears the ticket in half, gives one half to Danny, and puts the other in the ticket box. A few minutes into Slater IV, Danny's ticket stub begins to glow, and some dynamite from within the movie flies out of the screen, lands near Danny, and explodes. When Danny wakes up, he is in the back seat of Slater's car. He tries to convince Slater that they are in a movie, but Slater sees nothing unusual about his world. Jack doesn't believe him, but when one of the villains figures out with Danny knows so much about the world, he goes into Danny's world to destroy Slater in a different way where the bad guys always win.Now my only complaint being is that this movie is too long, we start off with Danny going into the action movie and him pointing out every cliché which was just great, he and Arnold had awesome chemistry, but then when they go into the villain going into Danny's world, we have another half of the story that could have been shorter. Jack Slater finding out his fictional, we didn't need so much sulking for an action movie. Also at the end where we're in our reality, it does turn into a bit of an action movie that goes back into clichés. But despite it's flaws, I still had a great time with this movie, it has some good laughs. I loved the part where the villain is in New York City and it's our reality, he shoots someone and screams in a public street that he killed a man and someone shouts out for him to shut up was just classic. Arnold also fighting Arnold(as Jack Slater) in reality was so funny as well. I loved this movie, I took it for what it was and really had a good time watching it. Give the movie a fair chance, if you're an action movie fan like I am, I'm sure you love Last Action Hero too.8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"29 January 2010","score":"2 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" I remember watching on the biography channel and Arnold Schwarzenegger was on, so I decided to watch it.

It's a tough choice. I actually was in the mood for a bad movie tonight, but a fun bad movie. And that's exactly what I expected from this. Also, I watched the unrated version, so I expected a few sexy moments. Sadly, there are none. There is nothing the least bit erotic about this movie. Even if you watched it with the sound off to avoid the horrible (and horribly intrusive) music, the lighting is so bad, and the shots so poorly composed, that the sex scenes are boring and irritating. And then there's the script. Johnathon Schaech's character has slept with Alyssa Milano's character twice and then says, I don't even know who I'm making love to anymore. Really? After sleeping with her twice? It's after a Halloween party, and they've established that she showed up to campus two weeks after the semester started. So she's been there, what, a month? The back of the DVD box calls it an erotic thriller. It's not erotic, and the director tried to make it a thriller when there was just under 13 minutes left in the film. Suddenly there is a shadow lurking outside her window, and then someone coming up the stairs, with those ridiculous early 1980s-type shots. Right before this we had the only bit in the film that made me laugh - the teacher's child suddenly running out of the house in slow motion. Oh no, is she heading toward the road? What could possibly happen here? Will there be a car? Will she get hit? Will we get the closeup of the headlights? Will her stuffed animal go flying up in the air, also in slow motion? Of course. Terrible. How do the writer and director of this film live with themselves?

It does not obey all of the infamous rules, and this was done intentionally. This is, to quote the pun, a cut above the rest. The idea is not complex and takes no explaining to understand. This uses the voyeurism that lies within us all, much like Rear Window, albeit in a considerably creepier manner. Myers watches. Waits. Carpenter masterfully builds atmosphere, suspense and tension in this way; one cannot expect anything that comes out of the blue to intimidate audiences. At most, that provides a shock. This does contain jump-scares, but on the whole, the fear is generated by the fact that we *know* he's there. It comes from the inevitability of it, from how little we see him(he is not overexposed, so we never get used to him, and only gradually do we get to see more of him), and from how beautifully undefined his appearance is. We are afraid of what we don't know or understand, and the realization of that is put to magnificent and powerful use here. The plot is straightforward, and easy to follow. This has perfect pacing, there isn't a single dull, rushing or superfluous moment to the tight 90 minute running time. The acting is nearly flawless; seriously, even the kids are quite convincing, and not particularly annoying. All of the characters are credible, and you can relate to them. The dialog is well-written, and every word spoken by a teenager or child actually sounds like something someone of that age would say. This has excellent cinematography and editing. The music is really effective and well-composed(if minimalistic in its arrangement). This scores extra points for me personally because it's a successful indie, and I find that those are often far superior to studio pictures; however, frankly, if you didn't know that this was made on a shoestring budget, you wouldn't be able to tell. The camera-work and the rest of the production is professional. This has pretty good comedy, in that the material usually works, it doesn't detract from the otherwise unnerving tone, and the jokes, like nearly everything in this(save for maybe hair, some sayings and clothes), are not dated. I would not really suggest checking out any of the sequels(and while I have not seen the remake myself, I feel fairly confident that it goes for that, as well; I have no problem with Rob Zombie, I like songs of his, and though his brand of terror may be good(haven't caught any movie of his, not outright trying to avoid them), it certainly isn't right for this franchise); not unless you *need* a fix of Michael. None of them add(much less anything positive or interesting), and this in no way requires a follow-up. Thank god they could not force John to have anything to do with many of them, and that he could get out of directing any other entries in the series than this. There is a bit of moderate(not all that graphic) violence, a little blood and brief, arguably gratuitous, nudity and sexuality. The DVD contains informative trivia and the original trailer.
