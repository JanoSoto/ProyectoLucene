It throws caution to the wind and dares to be different, and to top it off, features two big stars playing very big roles. In simple terms, it's a big success. The rebellious films aren't the ones mostly likely to succeed but You've Got Mail does on almost every level as a romantic comedy.The story is centered around two people in two very different financial positions in New York City. Joe Fox (Hanks) is a rich and confident man who runs Fox Books, a massive store in the vein of Barnes & Noble or Borders. Kathleen Kelly's (Ryan) shop is less than a hundred feet away. There she runs a much smaller, personal bookstore the Capitalist way called Around the Corner. Due to this new massive retail giant opening up she is losing customers fast and worries her store will have to close its doors.In the meantime, Joe and Kathleen should be rivals, but they have unwillingly been talking to each other and exchanging very personal conversations over the internet via a chat-room. Joe is NY152 and Kathleen is Shopgirl. Needless to say they don't know who each other is, but they find a certain solace in that. Maybe the advice comes less sugarcoated when you hear it from somebody you're not well acquainted with.Eventually, the inevitable happens and Kathleen's shop is forced into the ground and the remaining inventory to be bought by Joe. While this is all happening, Kathleen is also trying to get in contact with this NY152, but winds up being stood up. This is the only part of the film where I began to have a problem. It seems like the storyline and clichés past would hint that these two characters would find out the identities of one another about halfway through. Instead, You've Got Mail becomes an exercise in long, sometimes tedious pacing, and some moments we encounter leave us asking how did you not get that hint? If hadn't been for the uniquely witty writing and the terrific supporting cast I may have quickly lost interest. Supporting roles consist of Dave Chappelle as Joe's best friend, and Steve Zahn, one of my favorite men in the business today, Heather Burns, and All in the Family's Jean Stapleton as Kathleen's faithful coworkers who try to keep her optimistic when the NY152 drama starts unrolling before their eyes.Going back to the internet portion of the film, who would've thought in the mid-nineties, when the internet was created and released to the public, that ten to fifteen years later it would become one of the main ways to form relationships? I could see people in 1998, seeing You've Got Mail, chuckling and rolling their eyes at the idea of one talking to someone who is seemingly a complete stranger. Years later, we do it all the time.Another thing I picked up along the way, if closely dissected, You've Got Mail doesn't seem like a love story at all. It seems like a genius drama centered around business. Here we have a very successful businessman who can create and operate a huge retail store while barely doing any work. He still manages to win the heart of his competitor even after closing her shop and making her feel extremely inferior. That's the power of big business. When closely examined, You've Got Mail is another simple and amusing romantic comedy guaranteed to charm and tear-up any lady. When looked at with a broader focus, one can see the business undertones quietly cemented in.So, my three and a half stars go to the movie and the big picture focus both of You've Got Mail. This is a crafty, yet very subtle film about love and the power of wealthy corporations. It not only has that to offer seeing as Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan create inseparable chemistry together and are complemented by the writing and directing talents of Nora Ephron.Also, it's currently 2011. I wonder how Fox Books has faired with the high sales of Amazon's Kindle and the closing of the popular retailer Borders.Starring Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan, Dave Chappelle, Greg Kinnear, Steve Zahn, Heather Burns, and Jean Stapleton.

This film that has been voted #1 on the American Film Institute's Top 10 Westerns is the quintessential Western on the surface, and I don't mean that negatively. But The Searchers works on so many levels of thrills and escapism that I'm surprised by the amounts of people who praise it for its so-called psychological dimension and ambiguity of its central character, Ethan Edwards, played by the iconic John Wayne.I think I should get to the point quickly before someone guns me without summation as a Western, The Searchers provides all the elements expected, the beautiful and vast landscapes, Monument Valley transcended by a dazzling cinematography never looked so photogenic, the battles, the chases, the lonely hero, a climactic shootout, everything to spend a great moment in the theater after having watched the last 'Tom and Jerry' Cartoon and one ad or two about the tasty flavor of a cigarette as quick on the draw as Wayne's trigger. In other words, The Searchers is as great an entertainment as Star Wars for the Sci-Fi genre, and I accept that as an objective fact, and since John Ford is among the film-makers that I most respect, I won't object that the success and popularity of the film is not deserved.However, I believe the film has been somewhat taken as an intellectual hostage to those who only praise the portrayal of Ethan Edwards, the first anti-heroic character played by John Wayne. The limits of this assumption is the way it indirectly takes out of consideration all the previous films made by Ford, and insists that this is the first one to feature characters with ambiguous moralities, when ironically, The Searchers is one Ford's less subtle film when it comes to depict the antagonism between Whites and Indians. The movie did so much to show the Comanches as bloodthirsty warriors that it's not Edwards shooting on a dead Indian's eyes that will make him less sympathetic than his fellow searchers. Edwards may have a personal business with the Indians but after what they did to his family, it's hard not to share his grief, regardless of what he does.So, if Ford really tried to go against the grain, the Indians should have been portrayed in a more sympathetic way and not acted as alibis for Edwards' cruelty. But I'm not blaming the movie for that, I mentioned the ambiance of the movie theaters in the 50's to better point out how this movie belongs to an era where everything was shown in a simplistic way, Whites were the respectable pioneers and Indians the natural antagonists to the Conquest of the West. The Searchers goes as far as showing the Indians as an invisible villain, whose cruelty is highlighted by the psychological effect on the kidnapped white women, and a sense of family made of borrowing or buying women. I hate political correctness but the other extreme is no better.The plot of The Searchers is also one of the most memorable, Edwards and Pawley, Jeffrey Hunter as Wayne's disciple, search the little Debbie, the only surviving member of their family after a savage farm attack, and the whole interrogation is on one motivation. While Pawley obviously wants his sister back, we're never sure about Edwards, because all his acts and words foreshadows the killing of Debbie because she became a squaw. Are we really to believe that the big Wayne will harm such a pretty little girl like Debbie, even if she's disguised as an Indian? Well, that'll be the day. I'm not even saying that the climax wasn't powerful, when he grabs, lifts and carries her before delivering the unforgettable Let's go home, Debbie isn't one of the most-defining moments of the Western genre, but did this really surprise anyone? The Searchers is probably the most blatant cases of over-analyzing, when the greatness seems to rely on John Wayne's character, while the film clearly established who the villains were, and who the hero was, and a flawed hero doesn't automatically make an antihero. On that level, I don't see the appeal of the film, and how it's this one that remained an inspiration for Martin Scorsese, and how Roger Ebert could have praised the guts of John Ford for The Searchers but wasn't sensitive for the much more controversial and thought-provoking High Noon. The Searchers is a 'great' film but in the same league of greatness than Star Wars, which doesn't hold a candle to 2001 A Space Odyssey in terms of symbolism and meaningfulness. But I don't think John Ford tried to make something 'special' with The Searchers, it's only of these westerns with a mission, a bad-ass hero, savage villains, and its share of romance and comedy.And this last point speaks for the traditional aspect of The Searchers, a film which features all the archetypal characters of a good western film, the comic relief old-timer, the reverend, the cavalry, the idealistic young woman who waits for charming prince, a campy fight, that was as cringe-worthy as the phantom punch in The Godfather, except that this one wasn't intentional. The director of Rio Bravo, Howard Hawks, said that a good film consisted on three great scenes and no bad scene, well despite some obviously bad scenes notably with the character of the fat Indian wife and the part when Pawley violently kicks her off his place, right on the butt, The Searchers is still a good film, because on the surface, it's exactly what we would expect from a Western, but the whole 'psychological' dimension is something that even Ford would have dismissed.And unfortunately, after The Wild Bunch, made only 13 years after, The Searchers looks, feels and sounds incredibly dated.

Dave is satirical, though not a deep and as complex as some movies can be.Anyway, Dave finds people jobs, but in his spare time his mimics the President of the United States because he has an uncanny resemblance to him (probably because Dave and the president are played by the same actor - Kevin Kline). The secret service find Dave when they are looking for a look alike to walk out of a hotel and into a limousine, simply to protect the president. Dave agrees, but unfortunately the president suffers from a stroke while sleeping with his secretary. Suddenly Dave finds himself ruling the United States from the oval office. He is doing this because the Chief of Staff wants to become president himself, and is attempting to remove the vice-president from office and move himself in under Dave. Unfortunately Dave proves to be too much to handle, and quickly turns the tables on the Chief of Staff and a battle of wits ensures.The main theme is appearance and reality. What we have is the president - a conservative law student who is adulterous, hates his wife, and simply cares only for himself. Then we have Dave - an out going man who comes to see the power of the office as being a responsibility to the people. The chief of staff is manipulating him, but when Dave learns of what this guy is doing, he begins to take the power that is supposed to be is - all the time being reminded that he is a simply clutz from the street who happens to look like the president. He has one thing that he holds the chief of staff to though - he is pretending to be the president under the directions of the chief of staff - if he goes down then so does the chief of staff.I guess what this movie is saying is that politicians are generally people who are caught up in a world revolving around the powerhouses in Washington and only go out to the people during elections to gain votes. At other times they simply don't care. It is an interesting criticism on the budget when Dave brings in his accountant friend to go over the US budget and easily slashes 650 billion dollars from places where money is being wasted. It would be interesting to get a proper accountant to look at the figures of the budget and see if this is the case, though we only know what the government is telling us.Dave was good, and it involved the clever battle of wits that I enjoy in some movies. There was little to really complain about and I did think that Dave was quite a noble gentleman.

Above any show I have ever seen has always been about creating caricatures and yet we are expected to care about these caricatures. I like a few of the songs on a certain level but as a narrative with characters and motivation I am afraid to say that I think 'Grease' is a mess of epic quality. The 1978 film adaptation is no different. While I think 'Grease' is a show that is hard to do well I think the movie might just be the worst version of the show that I have seen precisely because it is so iconic. Travolta and Olivia Newton John created icons free of motivation, real conflict, and conviction. 'Grease' is loud and noisy but never does it feel populated by human beings and this is due to horrible performances.The greatest problem with 'Grease' is that it has no real central conflict to the story. It definitely feels as if it has captured something in the ballpark of adolescence. Yet, 'Grease's definition of adolescence is such a distortion to bring out the easiest forms of theatricality. The problems faced in 'Grease' about blossoming sexuality and societal masks exist but 'Grease' not only confounds them but creates characters that make them seem the be all end all's. The quintessential grade school meaning of life question does he like me or not is not a good enough starting point. The show is about triviality especially in the Sandy and Danny romance because we both know they love each other and they both essentially have a similar circle of friends but the conflict that keeps these lovers apart is all about what clothes they wear. The actors have been given a near impossible task to overcome to make these caricatures characters. If singing in a musical should be the pinnacle of a character's emotional need to speak out than these characters are emotionally warped. The musical numbers are loud and well choreographed and sung but they feel so far detached. And I grant that reality isn't necessarily what one looks for but a certain sense of reality is needed in rooting these characters. Because everything is so false in the acting we feel like we are being lied to. That essentially what acting is, lying, but never do we get to that baseness unless something is really off or consciously dissected.Because the songs do not come from a place of reality(not even heightened reality) the whole musical seems cartoonish. I think a particularly good example of the actor's failure is when actress Stockard Channing's Rizzo sings Look At Me I'm Sandra Dee. Channing is a great singer but a lousy actress. Granted the scene is Rizzo making fun of Sandy because of her insecurities and I think that really is a compelling place to start a scene but even in her attempt to create a sarcastic caricature she seems over the top. I think it is telling that even in a moment where the play is trying to be over the top that it still comes off as too over the top. Channing creates horrible choices with her body, jerking herself around in such mechanical unnatural ways. Her voice accents every lyrical quality of the music in such a blunt and violent matter that we don't notice the lyrics of the song. I've always found the ending to 'Grease' to be very troubling and I think the happy go lucky quality to 'You're the One That I Want' really shows this. I was more opposed to the crowd than anything else. I think this is important because it shows that even in a musical where you don't sing but are there there has to be a motivation and conviction to being there. The crowd scenes in musicals are hard to pull off well because you have to think about every actor creating a motivation for a whole crowd to erupt in song. The show ends with Sandy essentially giving up all her moral high ground and convictions and becoming like Danny who has not mutually changed himself. I can see why Sandy and Danny all dance but why the crowd? Shouldn't this moment have been merely between Sandy and Danny? They go into a funhouse and yet you see the hands of Danny's gang poking through the windows and they are there at the end. Why? I don't think the actors or the director thought hard here because they appear like gorillas and it makes the ending troubling. It can't just be gratuitous placement of characters even if they don't sing and just dance they still have to have motivation. If one doesn't just sit back and turn their brain off here than the ending feels symbolically like rape. I realize I might be looking too hard into this but I DID care about Sandy in a way. The inclusion of these apes actually left me after viewing 'Grease' to think that Danny wasn't going to shape up and so the lyrics ultimately meant nothing and Sandy's metamorphosis is a defeat. Having the lyrics mean nothing is the worst thing you can do in a musical. It is telling that this happens in 'Grease' during it's most famous number.Sure 'Grease' may be escapist and the musical quality I suppose is kind of fun but the acting is awful. I want to see a production of 'Grease' which has Danny and Sandy in it and not the bad boy and the nice girl with their groupies.

And really, it's not all that hard to see why. No, I won't call it one of the best movies of all time but its themes, the characters, the story and its message make sure that this is a movie to enjoy, over and over again.Basically it's being a very warm, heartfelt and honest movie, about real characters in real life situations. The James Stewart character feels very humane and realistic and James Stewart was always a great choice for playing a sort of average Joe, everybody in the audience could relate and identify themselves with. It's also part of the reason why his character is often being voted one of the best out of movie history.It's sort of funny how this movie has grown into being a sort of a Christmas classic, while about two-thirds of the movie are totally not Christmas related at all. It isn't until it last 30 minutes or so that the movie is suddenly all about Christmas and its themes and messages of giving and sharing with each other. It's definitely showing some parallels to Charles Dickens' 'A Christmas Carol'. It's what makes the movie a very warm one, even though the movie itself remains a drama and a quite heavy one as well.The story itself is just great. It's really typical for its time, with all of its drama and developments but with a great twist to it as well. The movie has a fantasy theme in it, which is not typical for its time or genre at all. It perhaps even makes this movie feel a bit like a 'modern' fairytale. Needless to say, it makes the movie a very original one within its genre and its where the movie gets most of its charm and warmth from.The movie is really a great example of some fine film-making and wonderful storytelling. It shows once more that you don't need all that much to create an unforgettable movie, that has an impact on a lot of people, even now days. The movie is about simple little things in life and perhaps that's the movie its greatest power. Everybody can relate to it, which causes them to be easily touched by the movie its themes and messages as well.Big part of the reason why it all works out so well is James Stewart but you also need to give credit to some of the other actors as well. I for instance, also really liked Lionel Barrymore in this, as the villain. I'm normally a not too big fan of Lionel Barrymore, or any of the other old Barrymore's (John and Ethel) but I must say he was perfectly cast in this movie, as the tough, old, mean Mr. Potter.Basically a wonderful made, simple, honest, heartfelt movie, with some great, effective and timeless themes in it, which all ensures that this is a perfect movie to watch over and over again.9\/10 http\/\/bobafett1138.blogspot.com\/ ","genre":null},{"date":"17 December 2011","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" No doubt about it that Frank Capra was one of the best directors of all time and James Stewart was one of the best actors of all time, so it shouldn't come as a surprise that this is also one great movie to watch.This movie always on a lot of top-lists and many well known and respected film-makers consider this to be one of their favorite movies, including director Frank Capra and actor James Stewart themselves.

Unfortunately, they find out certain truths about Lee's find - starting with the fact that, some time after it awakens and runs amok, that it absorbs its victims' intelligence & memories - through the eyes, no less! The filmmakers, led by director Eugenio Martin, prove up to the challenge of shooting in these claustrophobic train sets, and create what is quite a beautiful and stylish movie, one that never ever stops moving and delivers some delicious atmosphere and an action packed climax. Elements of religion and intrigue are added to the story with great results; there are some enjoyable turns in this story along the way. The international cast performs the material with gusto. Lee and Cushing work well together as always and Cushing, playing a somewhat less honourable character than usual (he's not above bribery), gets to have some real fun. The supporting cast includes lovely ladies Silvia Tortosa and Helga Line, and Alice Reinheart, as well as some men who deliver especially solid performances Julio Pena as Inspector Mirov, and Alberto de Mendoza as demented monk Father Pujardov; also to be seen is Victor Israel as the whistling baggage handler. First time viewers should be aware that another star attraction, Telly Savalas, does not show up until the final third, but he makes the most of his brief screen time, tearing into the scenery with relish as a domineering Cossack officer. This Spanish \/ UK production is great fun for horror genre fans and this reviewer must now say that he wishes he'd seen it a lot sooner. It truly is a must see. Nine out of 10.

Young Guns with its youthful cast introduced by one my all-time favorite intros Emilio Estevez, Kiefer Sutherland, Lou Diamond Philips, Charlie Sheen, Casey Siemaczko and Dermot Mulroney, looks closer to the typical 80's film marketed for teenage audiences than a mature film meant to be taken seriously, on the surface only &#x85; because if you watch it, and decide to appreciate the film regardless of your personal tastes &#x85; well, I defy anyone not to be captivated by theses 100 minutes of pure entertainment.Yes, even the dark Pale Rider pales in comparison with Young Guns, because the latter doesn't overdo the archetypes of the genre, it has its load of thrills, of chases, shootouts, parties, romances, discussions BUT with something more that lacks even in the most acclaimed masterpieces of the genre  it has characters, a wonderful gallery of characters, who carry their personalities less than stereotypes than true human flows, with their motives, actions and reactions, and within the plot of the film, there are different arcs involving each of these characters, handled with such a confidence, that nothing ever feels forced or cliché, and at the end, each of them would ultimately change, making Young Guns more than a Western but also a sort of coming-of-age story, a genre cherished during the 80's. And of course, the biggest change will concern the leader of the bunch who'll become one of the most defining legends of the Old West.As a kid, I grew up reading The Adventures of Lucky Luke, a Franco-Belgian comic book set in the Old West, needless to say that I loved it so much, I was familiar with Billy the Kid, the stagecoaches, Jesse James, Calamity Jane, the Conquest of the West before I reached my tenth year, so I discovered Young Guns at the age of 13, with enough knowledge of the Old West to appreciate it and not enough of cinematic westerns to judge it impartially. And I'll never forget that night, when I saw it with my father, I didn't care much about the story until that young blondish guy introduced himself by William Bonney and the other said Pat Garrett, I told my dad, hey, it's Billy the Kid, and this is the guy who'll kill him The movie took a whole new direction for me and it immediately grabbed my interest. And the rest didn't disappoint me.Young Guns is a movie whose rooting process is slow but efficient, you definitely get into the story when the tutor, John Tunstall, remarkably played by Terrence Stamp, is killed by men who belongs to the cattle owner and biggest competitor, the evil Murphy, Jack Palance whose evil smirk hasn't lost its touch either. Then, the 'young guns' are mandated as 'regulators' to arrest the killers, then it all gets wrong when Billy, the previously underestimated newcomer makes this business personal. He makes himself an enemy through Dick, Charlie Sheen, the straight man of the bunch, who'll get killed as if fate wanted another kind of leader, and progressively, as blood is shed and guns are fired, we get into the others, Doc, Kiefer Sutherland as the poet in love with a little Chinese girl sold to Murphy for a dirty shirt, Chavez, Philips as the only surviving of a Navajo tribe killed by Murphy's men with the army as accomplice, and of course, his 'friend', the scene-stealing tobacco-chewing Dirty Steve.But the one who touched my heart the most was Simeaczko as Charley Bowder, the nicest and most friendly (also cowardly) of the bunch. It was a nice touch for the story to have a character who doesn't react as a coldblooded killer but feels sick from the simple thought that he might be hanged, and his evolution is also one of the most rewarding aspects of the film, as I never fail to have goose bumps in the scene where he finally overcomes his fear and start getting into the shootout that concludes the film. And talking of the shootout, it's certainly one of my all-time favorite climactic sequences because I never saw the way it started coming and the amount of thrills is so great that at the end, me and my Dad, sorry, my Dad and me &#x85; could only wow, and I knew I had just watched one of the greatest films ever.Yes, Young Guns became one of my all-time favorite films because of so many things, the extraordinary performance of Emilio Estevez, the difference between the characters and my rooting for each of them, the amazing shootout, the coming-of-age story and beyond everything, the emotional core of the film a great message about solidarity and friendship, as mentioned by the concluding line of the film  Pals, before followed by one hell of an amazing soundtrack.So say what you want, it may not be the best Western ever made, it didn't get any Oscar nominations, but for some reason, it will forever have a special place in my heart.

Movies such as Dawn of the Dead, the Texas Chiansaw Massacre, The Fog, When a Stranger Calls and The Omen have all received this treatment and the end is result is always the same. Crap! But in the 1980's some truly classic remakes were released that were superior to the originals in many ways (usually because the director was a fan of the original and wanted to pay homage to that). John Carpenter's The Thing and David Cronenberg's The Fly were far more impressive than the 1950's movies they were inspired by and that can also be said for the 1988 remake of The Blob. Inspired by a rather naff Steve McQueen movie, Chuck (A Nightmare On Elm Street 3, The Mask) Russell's reimagining was a fun, gore-packed sci-fi horror that featured Matt Dillon's younger brother Kevin as the lead anti-hero, with Saw's Shawnee Smith as the cheerleader-cum-heroine, who try to save small town America from a jello-like substance that devours everything in its path. While a little cheesy in places, this movie is hugely enjoyable and should be a lesson to modern directors that if you're going to remake a movie, do it properly!There is a glut of horror remakes rearing their heads at the moment but for my money this is one of the best around and dare I say it,even better than the original Kevin Dillon gives an incredible performance as the leather-jacketed reluctant hero as do the rest of the cast.

I think this is somewhat of a letdown from the first movie because I believe Eddie Murphy's charm on the audience wore off the second time around. I thought he did really well though.Axel Foley returns to Beverly Hills and reteams with Taggert and Rosewood after a near fatal shooting to solve the so-called Alphabet crimes that has the wonderful California city in disarray.I already gave my opinions of Eddie Murphy above. If you're a fan of his, you'll like this. If not, well you won't. I thought the chemistry between Taggert and Rosewood is still there. It seems like how Rosewood is trying to impersonate an action star like Stallone or Eastwood.Tony Scott, the director of the awesome Top Gun came through here. He adds a great balanced mixture of action and comedy. There is also another rave soundtrack of great 80's tunes to listen to.Overall, this is a great action movie but not as good as the first. I rate this film 8\/10.

Which made me really curious of the movie and what made me really wanna watch it is the presence of Denzel Washington & Julia Roberts.It's a good, racy thriller with oodles of suspense. There're many heart-beating moments when the assassins get really close to ticking off the lead actors.Both of them come up with intense performances although Julia at the time had a long way to go. Even the chemistry between Julia & Denzel didn't happen as expected.The background score was OK, could have been more anticipatory & tense.But I appreciate the tight direction. You could have put lesser known actors in here and the movie could still have become a hit, thanks to director Alan Pakula & his team.Verdict Good thriller drama, just wished for more fire between the super hotties Roberts & Washington. Sigh!
