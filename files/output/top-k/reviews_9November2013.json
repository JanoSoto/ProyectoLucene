[{"date":"9 November 2013","score":"","review":" I guess at first I thought this was going to be a really bad, annoying, Revenge of the Nerds rip off. In fact I was very wrong. Rushmore is a very powerful movie about a friendship torn apart over the love of one woman. It is about a boy who is far more mature than those of his own age, yet he is lacking in regards, including understanding what a relationship really means. In fact it is one of the rare Hollywood movies where the main character gives up on the girl, but that is the whole point of the movie.Rushmore is about a boy named Max Fischer, who goes to the exclusive Rushmore School. He is very intelligent, though is failing in class. What he is good at though is networking and building up a base of alliances and friendships. At one assembly he meets Mr Blume (Bill Murry) and immediately sets to work forming a relationship with him. He then discovers Miss Cross, a prep teacher, after reading a hand written note in a book. Through numerous events, Mr Blume and Miss Cross become attracted to each other.Even then the movie is not as simple as that. The main focus of the movie is Fischer's lust over Miss Cross and how he comes to terms with the fact that he can never have her. Why can he never have her? Well the reasons seem simple, but mainly that he is fifteen and she is a lot older. They actually get along very well, but she sees him as an intelligent fifteen year old who really does not understand what relationships are all about. Fischer not only must come to terms with her continual rejection, but also that his friend, Mr Blume, is also in love with her.My friend commented on how this is a really hard movie to watch. I don't think so. I guess the hard thing is that the movie says, clearly, that there are going to be women which you simply cannot have. Sometimes enough is enough and you must accept defeat. The thing with Fischer is that there was a perfectly nice girl following him around, but he was too caught up in Miss Cross that he did not realise she existed. When he finally stepped back he saw her. In a way is seems that he took second best, but I think the woman that he is dating at the end of the movie is by far the best woman for him.What about us? When do we know when to quit? Well I can't really answer that question. Sometimes we just don't know if we are chasing a Miss Cross or not. Miss Cross is a mature and intelligent woman who simply could not form a serious relationship with somebody as immature as Fischer. Indeed Fischer is immature, especially the comment he made regarding his protégé's mother, but the thing is that he learnt from this mistake. The big problem is that he is fifteen, a lot younger than Miss Cross, and even though relationships of that age difference do exist, Cross was not interested in it. She wanted somebody whom she felt comfortable with, and she did not feel comfortable with a boy.I think we can take things from this movie, but we shouldn't go out with a woman because we did not get our first choice. We should go out with somebody we want to. I don't know the full thing with Fischer, but it seems that the realisation was that why was he chasing a woman that could not handle a relationship with him when there was a perfectly good woman wanting one. In my case, well it is probably the same. I really don't want to let go, especially since the woman I like is quite stubborn. But there is really no clear cut answer. I guess the key is to be patient (which is not a human trait).

The film is interesting as we look at the date, it was made after Glastnost, the time when Soviets were given the freedom of speech, and the collapse of the Soviet Union. There are a number of things that are said in this movie that is ironic considering that it was true. Another thing is that Tom Stoppard wrote the screenplay and that added to my impression of the movie. Tom Stoppard is a very talented playwright and anything written by him I expect to be of a high quality.The Russia House explores the relationship that grows between a Russian publisher and an English publisher, and the world of intrigue that they are dragged into. This is not a typical good guy verses bad guy movie, but rather about people that get caught up in things that are beyond their control.The movie is focused on two people - Barly and Katynia. While Barly was at a Russian poet's camp, he met a strange guy named Dante. They talk about truth and the nature of loving one's country. A few years later, Katynia comes looking for Barly, but as she cannot find him, she hands some manuscripts to somebody else. In this man's search for Barley he decides to pass it to British intelligence, and when they look at the manuscripts they realise that it contains a lot of the Soviet Union's strategic plans, and these plans actually show them how weak the state is.Dante simply wanted these manuscripts published, but the intelligent agencies realised that these manuscripts going public could bring a quick end to the cold war. If the Soviet Union is as bad as it really is then there is no real need for having such a sophisticated intelligent ring. Thus they decide that they want to find out more information and to learn if the source is reliable.It is interesting because when the Soviet Union collapsed, it came out that its military machine was not as threatening as it was. This movie was made before the collapse, so it was either already known or it was something to make the plot more interesting. Still, I find it difficult to believe that the US did not really know how bad the Soviets were because of the extent of their intelligent agencies, but then the CIA may not have been as good as it is made out in the movies.What is good is that this movie is not the typical American anti-communist propaganda, such as Little Nikita was. It does not go on about how great the American way of life is and how bad and evil the Russians are. It does suggest that the system is bad, but it is more the oppression of the government than anything else. Most of this movie pushes the beauty of Russia, and we constantly see some of the ancient buildings that dominate Moscow and St Petersburg. Everything is different now, but we are looking back at a time before the USSR had collapsed.This is a very good movie namely because the characters are so in-depth. The end does not come out like a soppy ending to an American romance, but rather it is one that emphasises that there is not good or bad, just people who are involved in conflicts that they are not interested in.

I'm not normally a fan of horror film sequels, most are misses then hits in my book but this film is one of those hits.What I really like about this sequel is it's premise where it takes place just moments after the ending. I think thats a cool idea which is something I never see much, most sequels take place usually years latter. This approach made the first one connect more adequately with this sequel which made the two film seem like one movie.I love the score as usual, it's been remixed with the use of the synthesizer and I feel this film has the best use of it. I still like the original piano score, but the synthesizer version is great in it's own way it's still has a spooky tone to it but has an almost upbeat sensibility to it. Even like them using the old song Mr. Sandman which was never the same to me after watching this film.The main characters are good as usual. Jamie Lee Curtis is good as Laurie as usual despite not in the film that long. Laurie is really sympathetic because she's scared out of her wits afraid Michael is still after her, which he is. Her injuries really put a handicap factor on her which means she won't be able to move very fast. Yet, as usual she can still hold her own against danger, really loved how she handled the revolver makes me wonder if she is an expert marksman, if you've seen the places she shot. But I like that there was a revelation on her character which I felt provided depth to her and made her not just another typical wrong place wrong time protagonist.Donald Plesence is good as usual as Dr. Sam Lommis. His character was almost a show stealer, in a way this film made him more the main protagonist. I like how he's more active in this film, he has some memorable liners my favorite heightens my sense of security. Even sympathetic as the Sheriff who drank a can of dumb ass keeps blaming him for Michael's escape which really wasn't his fault, and his efforts get undermined for no good reason.Michael (The Shape) is still well him. I like that here we see some creative kills from him, the effects on those kills are really up to par but not to exploitive. My favorite kill is the hammer to the head, it was to me the most painful because of the little sound affect at the end after Michael swinged it overhead, ouch.However what powers the film the most is in it's suspense and atmosphere. I really like the fact that the hospital has been used as the arena. Hospitals in horror I always thought were creepy, heck whenever I play theSilent Hill video games I'm always a little wary of going in because they practically have death written all over them. Which is the perfect place for Michael, in the first one it was more open world where Mike had plenty of places to go, but here this is in a confined space despite limited to open area he has more places to hide then before, let alone all the resources he needs and Laurie where he wants her; these things really give Mike an advantage. Let alone location of the hospital which is far from town which means help is far away.I like the use of lighting, it's true that a normal hospital would never have that much low lighting at night. But this choice I felt was wise because it made the hospital seem instead of a place of danger instead of salvation. Each shadow and every dark corridor feels like The Shape could be hiding. Even like the use of the monitor camera shots, where we would see Michael walk in one hallway on the monitors which is basically a one step ahead device.And that chase scene my favorite scene in the film, between Laurie and Mike is thrilling and has the participatory factor as usual where I was thinking cmon find a way out now now now!; personally I like this chase scene between the two in this film the best because Laurie and Mike had more places to go and utilize the enviorment of the hospital well.The only problems is I do think the pacing of the film does lag a bit around the second half. I didn't really care much for any of the new supporting characters they were all two dimensional and disposable in my book, well OK a few of them have a moment or two like Budd who sings that song I thought was funny, but like I said moments it's not enough.Overall it's a solid follow up, it doesn't blow me away like the first but it's not trying to. But all the same like any Halloween treat it's worth a try.

Chan has appeared in other Hollywood movies, but this is the first that he is one of the major stars. Rush Hour successfully mixes Hollywood sensationalism with the fight scenes and the stunts we expect from Jackie Chan.Basically a girl, who is one of Chan's students, moves to the United States as her father is a Chinese Ambassador. Chan and this guy recently destroyed the assets of a major crime ring, Juntao, including retrieving millions of dollars of Chinese art.

But one of the new neighbours is unlike everyone else. They only come out at night, they don't look after their house like everyone else, they spend the night digging in the back yard. The rest of the street start talking and a couple of the guys decide to snoop around as they have suspicions that the new neighbours have killed their other neighbour.This is a dark comedy from the late 80's. It is funny, but i would not say this is an 80's classic. It definitely had that 80's feel which I love and the story was entertaining, but i just felt that all of these actors have done much better films.The movie stars Tom Hanks﻿ as Ray. Tom is brilliant as always. He did not disappoint at all. Tom is in my top 5 actors of all time. He has made so many fantastic movies. This film also stars Bruce Dern, Rick Ducommun, Carrie Fisher, Corey Feldman﻿ and Henry Gibson. The casting was very good. It is a very strong cast list. Corey Feldman is another actor that is in my top 5 favourite actors list. I always thought that he didn't get the recognition that he deserved. When he was younger he was an amazing actor, with a very impressive CV. I love so many of his movies. I have actually met Corey twice now. The first time I met him he was really friendly and very chatty. I spoke with him and Corey Haim that day. It was so good to meet them and tell them that I loved their work. The second time I met him, he was not as nice. He pretty much ignored me. He signed an autograph for me, but basically sat on his mobile phone texting someone and laughing with his friends. I would understand if I was bothering him in the street, but he was at an official signing. It was a disappointment. But that does not take anything away from him as an actor. He is still in my top 5. Carrie did a good job in this movie. She played Toms wife. I found this very difficult to come to term with. I don't know why, they just didn't seem to go well together. Maybe I am still struggling to think of her as Princess Leia. I should have got over that by now. I have seen quite a few of Carries films, but she will always be the princess to me.There were a few slapstick moments in the film, which I found very funny. There were a few laugh out loud moments too, but not too many. I was expecting this to be funnier than it was, but it was still good.I really liked the ending too. It was full of twists and it did keep me guessing.I will give this film 7 out of 10.Now they know that we know that they know that we know.For more reviews, please like my Facebook pagehttps\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews\/456572047728204?ref=hl ","genre":null},{"date":"9 November 2013","score":"","review":" THE 'BURBSI had never seen this before yesterday.The movie is about a street where everyone knows everyone.

Really? I thought it was already personal after the second Jaws film was made and another shark attacked poor Amity Island again. If Jaws The Revenge should be seen as anything personal it should be viewed as a personal attack - better yet, an assault - on a tremendous horror film that capitalized off of suspense and editing.I should've reviewed Jaws The Revenge three weeks ago, but I've been putting it off because I've needed to review other films since then. And also, what can be said about Jaws The Revenge that hasn't already been reiterated and restated time and time again? The film is a dreary slog that consists of waiting for suspense and atmosphere to build, waiting for the shark to appear, being disgusted when the shark finally does appear, and then finally being greeted with the end credits, concluding the mess we just witnessed. If you still want to classify the film as a horror film, even though I'd argue the series thrust its way into the action genre after the second film, then this is one of the worst, most redundant horror films I have yet to see.The film stars Ellen Brody (Lorraine Gary), whose husband Martin from previous films has died of a heart attack, which is believed to be brought on from the stress of dealing with sharks in Amity Island. Ellen now lives with her son Sean (Mitchell Anderson), who is sheriff deputy, and his fiancée Tiffany (Mary Smith). Despite normality seemingly coming back for the gang, Ellen is convinced she is being followed by a great white shark when she vacations to the Bahamas to visit her eldest son Michael (Lance Guest). Now it's a matter of killing another shark before the shark can kill them.It's no wonder Steven Spielberg had no interest in pursuing a sequel to his original Jaws film and had no involvement with any of the three sequels. I imagine he recognized that a man vs. shark is only really fresh the first time around and that doing the same thing film after film would begin to become monotonous and painfully familiar. Even if Jaws The Revenge wasn't plagued with such lame acting, terrible effects work, and collectively sterile camera-work, it would be hard to convince us that a fourth movie about a group of people going after another shark would be something worth paying to see.I recall when I watched Jaws 3 and got so tired with the characters and the plot that I just wanted to see a shark attack. Then I saw how painfully cheap and ridiculous the shark looked and kind of wanted more exposition. Then when I received more exposition I kind of just wanted the entire thing to end. The film was a muchness. Jaws The Revenge suffers from the same form of monotony. One is constantly waiting for something to happen, then upon being rewarded, they wish they had never seen such a thing. For the purists who complain that the shark was clearly artificial in the original Jaws, I'd love to see how they responded to the shark in Jaws The Revenge. I doubt there's enough howling in the world that could do justice to its artificiality and stunning banality.Thus concludes the Jaws franchise for now, thankfully. This is one of the few franchises I know of (next to the contemporary Paranormal Activity series) that failed to have another good film after its first film, which, in both series' cases, was phenomenal.

Her actual Powhatan name was Matoaka. Pocahontas was a nickname given to her by the English settlers which meant spoiled child or the naughty one. Many only know her as Pocahontas, which I must say that was what I thought her name was until now. The setting of the film is very fairytale-like and very animated to make the scene look more appealing. If one actually analyzes the setting in the movie, they will see many wrong geographical landscapes. They clearly did not do much research on the geography and environment of Jamestown. In the movie, Pocahontas is seen a top of huge cliffs and mountains which was wrong because the land of Jamestown is mostly and relatively flat. They make the environment a more dramatic scenery than it truly was. One other geographical inaccuracy is the fact that the Disney movie shows moose, bald eagles, sunflowers, and other animals and plants that clearly were not in the town of Virginia. Also, Pocahontas is seen near a waterfall in the film, but Jamestown did not have waterfalls like the one in the movie. Aside from the geographical inaccuracies in Pocahontas, Disney portrays the Powhatan culture as a stereotypical Indian tribe which many Indian tribes were nothing alike. The men of the tribe did not wear feathers and neither did they wear skirts. Most of the Indians wore close to nothing of clothes, but they cannot show nudity in a cartoon movie. Also, Disney made their houses look like regular Indian longhouse which is not what they lived in. This movie disrespects a lot of the Native American culture. It is also believed that the Native Americans had a wonderful relationship with the animals which was most likely wrong. Yes, they may have had a better understanding of the habitat and animals, but it was not like they portrayed in the movie. In Pocahontas, Hollywood makes one believe that the Indians and English settlers were all mean to each other which is inaccurate. It was actually the English men who did not like the Indians and invaded the Indians land, brought war, diseases, and other unwelcome changes. It shows in the movie, the Native Americans preparing to fight the 'paleface demons' which makes them look equally to blame for the troubles between the two. Clearly, the English settlers were to blame for the invasion. Much of the tribe, like ninety percent, died from the diseases brought to the lands because they were not accustomed to those sicknesses. One of the historical accuracy was how the settlers acted in the movie, Pocahontas. They were there for Gold, God, and Glory which was very true. Also, the Englishman sang a song when they arrived to the lands about the Indians. One of the lyrics from the song quotes, Savages, savages, barely even humans, which the English settlers did think of the Native Americans during that time. The Disney movie also does not show Pocahontas helping the English settlement in Jamestown. If it were not for her support, then many more of the settlers would have died. One of the biggest historical inaccuracy in the Disney animated film, Pocahontas, is the romantic relationship between Pocahontas and John Smith. She was portrayed to be this young woman and him to be a young man. More than likely, Pocahontas was ten to thirteen years old and John was in his later twenties, which that is a huge difference than what the movie makes you believe. So, when one thinks that, one must think John Smith was a pedophile, but truly they had no romance between them. The movie makes one think that they meet at a waterfall and instantly fall in love, but more than likely they did not meet that way considering there was not a huge waterfall like that in Jamestown. Close to the ending of the movie, Pocahontas, one sees her throw herself on John Smith to save him from getting killed by the Powhatan tribe because she was in love with him. That was wrong. She did not have to save John Smith nor was she in love with him. At the end of the movie, the Disney movie makes you believe that she was torn between staying with her father and the Powhatan tribe or leaving to go to England with the man she loves. That was not the case. Pocahontas was kidnapped by English settlers and became a Christian, she was baptized and given a new name, Rebecca. She became married to a John, not John Smith, but John Rolfe. Then later in her late twenties, she became sick with some disease like tuberculosis and died. In conclusion, the Walt Disney movie, Pocahontas, was a wonderful movie. But the historical background and how Pocahontas was portrayed was entirely inaccurate. Many say this is one of the most inaccurate historical movies out there in the nation and after finding all the material that was wrong, I must say I agree with others. Even though it was a great animated, fairytale movie, that does not make it factual.

Many only know her as Pocahontas, which I must say that was what I thought her name was until now. The setting of the film is very fairytale-like and very animated to make the scene look more appealing. If one actually analyzes the setting in the movie, they will see many wrong geographical landscapes. They clearly did not do much research on the geography and environment of Jamestown. In the movie, Pocahontas is seen a top of huge cliffs and mountains which was wrong because the land of Jamestown is mostly and relatively flat. They make the environment a more dramatic scenery than it truly was. One other geographical inaccuracy is the fact that the Disney movie shows moose, bald eagles, sunflowers, and other animals and plants that clearly were not in the town of Virginia.

I know many adore this film and think of it fondly with great nostalgia. I waited a very long time to see it and finally decided to give it a try. I love westerns, 80's films and Disney classics but for some reason this didn't strike the right chord with me. Despite a promising concept, I found the film dawdles along without ever having a lot of chemistry between the key characters. The performances are good, in fact one in particular is excellent but its lacking depth when it comes to the relationships. The scenery is stunning and yet I felt like the film makers underused the breathtaking Australian outback. The film definitely shows a lot of beautiful horses so people that are looking for that will enjoy it. There is somehow a lack of significant emotion to a story that should be full of moving moments. The romance which should be a focal point in the latter part of the movie feels forced and rushed and very technical. There are some moments where it feels like they're actually bartering for the romantic lead.Tom Burlinson is our lead in the film. He is okay but he is also a key reason the characters lack emotion. He feels almost stoic at times and well he is always determined he wasn't necessarily the right choice for the lead of the movie. Kirk Douglas is literally the reason to watch this movie. He is amazing in a dual role as Harrison and Spur. Both characters are so different from each other and he just absolutely nails both. He is so obviously the seasoned professional and it shows. Sigrid Thornton is the object of Burlinson's affections but also causes one of the biggest issues with the movie. Thornton looks almost stunned throughout her entire performance and the chemistry between her and Burlinson is practically nil. Its almost painful to watch their so called romance unfold and yet I had heard what a classic love story this was but I didn't get it at all. Supporting cast is alright but no one really stands out as being noteworthy.Coming from a long history in Television director George Miller has done a lot of TV and a lot of straight to TV movies. I don't think he had the experience in movies to handle this and make it outstanding. Imagine this film in the hands of a truly amazing director who stuns with cinematography and could handle the script better. That being said, the script left a lot to be desired too. I suppose I was even more let down because this seems like the type of movie I would absolutely adore and I didn't. My expectations were high because so many people just rave about this and they love it and I respect that. I am not saying that its a terrible movie but it certainly didn't appeal to me at all.

He is joined by a naive follower (Eric Roberts). They stow away on a train consisting of four locomotives whose engineer has a heart attack and the train runs away. Meanwhile, the arrogant warden (John P. Ryan) is on the warpath for Manny.Runaway Train is such a powerful experience because it's much more than just a mindless action flick, as the title would suggest; the thrilling events are actually a stage for a fascinating study of the human condition. Manny is a hardened convict who's at war with the world and everyone in it. When called an animal he replies, No, worse -- human! This is a man who wants one thing, freedom, but he knows that he's too far gone to make it in conventional society. He shares a parable with his dumb partner, made up on the spot, about having a menial job and submitting to the boss even though you might want to rip his throat out. This is the key to making it in society -- submitting to authority and resisting the rage within; and then getting your check on payday and enjoying the fruits thereof. Manny wishes he could do this, but knows he can't. So what hope is there for him in modern society? If he can't do that then why's he escaping prison? In other words, Manny knows there's no hope for him, even if his escape is successful. To him, freedom can only come one way. I don't believe this, but I understand why he believes it.There's another potent scene where Manny has a knife and mercilessly comes against his own partner. You see the rage on his face, like a cornered animal. After intense emotions are vented Manny suddenly realizes... and then he just bows over, completely spent. A character, who should be afraid of him, somehow understands and compassionately reaches out in a semi-embrace.Powerful scenes like these are combined with surreal images of the misshapen locomotives barreling down the tracks in the freezing wilderness accompanied by the ominous score by Trevor Jones. Some parts of the score scream mid-80s, but other parts -- like the aforementioned -- are timeless.Rebecca De Mornay has an atypical role as a railroad worker who stumbles on to the convicts. She intuitively sees through their macho posturing. Although she knows they're desperate & dangerous, she also sees that they're not wholly evil. Roberts is basically a kid at heart and Manny is just blinded by the incredible rage within. He's only irredeemable because of his stupid pride, built up over years of hardened confinement.Voight is near unrecognizable as Manny and Roberts is just superb as his dumb sidekick. These two along with De Mornay are examples of acting at its finest.John P. Ryan is very effective as the machismo warden Ranken, but his Captain Ahab-like role comes off too comic booky to be plausible. Yet Ranken shows that you can be an animal on the outside of prison just as much as on the inside. Both Manny and Ranken are corrupted by pride, but Manny at least knows it. And he's not too far gone to recognize those who are worthy of life and to respond accordingly.The film was shot in Montana and Alaska and runs 111 minutes.GRADE A+ ","genre":null},{"date":"9 November 2013","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" How Runaway Train bombed at the box office in December, 1985, I'll never know because it's the perfect blend of blockbuster thrills and weighty subtext.The story involves Manny (Jon Voight), a notorious prison hero, who escapes a maximum security prison in the frozen wastelands of Alaska.

She intuitively sees through their macho posturing. Although she knows they're desperate & dangerous, she also sees that they're not wholly evil. Roberts is basically a kid at heart and Manny is just blinded by the incredible rage within. He's only irredeemable because of his stupid pride, built up over years of hardened confinement.Voight is near unrecognizable as Manny and Roberts is just superb as his dumb sidekick. These two along with De Mornay are examples of acting at its finest.John P. Ryan is very effective as the machismo warden Ranken, but his Captain Ahab-like role comes off too comic booky to be plausible. Yet Ranken shows that you can be an animal on the outside of prison just as much as on the inside. Both Manny and Ranken are corrupted by pride, but Manny at least knows it. And he's not too far gone to recognize those who are worthy of life and to respond accordingly.The film was shot in Montana and Alaska and runs 111 minutes.GRADE A+ ","genre":"Action, Adventure, Drama"},{"date":"9 November 2013","score":"","review":" Max Bialystock, a seedy Broadway producer, is persuaded by his dodgy accountant Leo Bloom, that he can make more money from a flop than from a hit. They come up with what they believe will be a sure money-making scheme. They take more money from investors than they can repay (overcapitalising the production to the tune of 25,000%) and then look around for a play certain to close on its first night, their logic being that the investors will not be looking for a return from a play known to be a failure. (A similar dishonest scheme was featured in an earlier film New Faces of 1937). They find an unpublished script by a half- mad German playwright, Franz Liebkind, who wants to show the world the Hitler with a song in his heart, and persuade him to let them produce it. They hire the ultra-camp Roger De Bris, a director whose plays close on the first day of rehearsal and cast in the leading role a drug-addicted hippie who hardly seems to know his own name. (He goes by the name LSD). Of course, the show turns out to be an improbable and unexpected hit, which leaves Bialystock and Bloom with one problem; how do they find the money to repay all their investors? Seen as a comedy about a dishonest producer and a crooked accountant, the film is no more than moderately amusing. Some of its scenes, notably the ones in which Bialystock is romancing the lecherous old ladies who constitute most of his investors, are frankly embarrassing, and those involving De Bris and his equally camp partner Carmen Ghia may seem a bit politically incorrect (although still funny) these days. The character of Ulla struck me as unnecessary, unless writer\/director Mel Brooks assumed that a pretty girl who regularly takes her clothes off is something necessary for the success of any film. The ending seems rather weak; Brooks seemed to have difficulty finding the right endings for a number of his films. (The ending of the otherwise excellent Blazing Saddles is even more of a let-down than this one). The Producers, however, is much more than just a comedy about a dishonest producer and a crooked accountant. What makes it a cult classic is the nature of the play which Bialystock and Bloom put on, an all-singing, all-dancing musical comedy extravaganza about Nazi Germany and Adolf Hitler, entitled Springtime for Hitler. (Brooks wanted to use that as the title of the film itself, but was overruled by the studio). The crazed neo-Nazi Liebkind's script, as interpreted by de Bris, comes complete with a high-kicking chorus line of girls dressed as storm-troopers and unforgettable lines like Don't be stoopid, be a smardy, come and join the Nazzy Pardy, voiced by Brooks himself in a broad New York accent. The first night audience in the theatre are initially repelled by what they see as bad taste but later decide that the play is in fact a brilliant satire which will run on Broadway for years. Over the years critical opinion about The Producers has been just as divided. There have always been plenty of critics such as Pauline Kael ready to lambaste it as vulgar and tasteless. The very broad style of acting, deliberately exaggerated and non-naturalistic, may also not have been to everyone's taste. My initial reaction was to call it theatrical, but in fact it bears only a passing resemblance to any style of acting I have ever seen in a theatre, even in a comedy. A closer comparison might be to a group of stand-up comics going through their routines. Zero Mostel who stars as Bialystock actually started his career as a nightclub comedian, although it must be said that Gene Wilder as Bloom is even more ever-the-top than Mostel. (Wilder started as a serious Method actor and this was his first venture into comedy, the genre in which he was later to specialise). Other critics such as Roger Ebert, however, have defended the film, and I must say that I am in their camp. There is a serious purpose (as there often was) behind Brooks's apparent lapse into bad taste. Just as the racial humour in Blazing Saddles served to expose the racist assumptions which underlay Hollywood's Myth of the West, so the Springtime for Hitler scenes here are satirical black comedy, not mere tastelessness for its own sake. Brooks himself said of the film If you stand on a soapbox and trade rhetoric with a dictator you never win.... But if you ridicule them, bring them down with laughter, they can't win. You show how crazy they are. It was essentially the same idea which Chaplin had when he made The Great Dictator or Orwell when he wrote Animal Farm, lampooning Stalin as the biggest pig in the barnyard. Dictators can survive the polemics of their political enemies. They cannot survive ridicule, and the Nazis have never seemed more ridiculous than they do here. My favourite story about the film is one told by Ebert. Shortly after The Producers was released Brooks and his wife Anne Bancroft were approached by a woman who said to him I have to tell you, Mr. Brooks, that your movie is vulgar. Brooks's response was Lady, it rose below vulgarity. That is just what The Producers does. It rises triumphantly below the level of vulgarity.

At first Daniel finds it difficult to make friends at his new school, but he eventually finds an attractive girlfriend named Ali. In doing so, however, he makes an enemy of Ali's jealous ex-boyfriend, Johnny, who never loses an opportunity to bully and torment Daniel, often with his friends joining in. To make matters worse, Johnny is a skilled student of karate, so Daniel decides he needs to study the martial arts himself in order to defend himself against Johnny and his gang of bullies. Fortunately, Daniel has befriended Mr. Miyagi, the elderly Japanese-American handyman in his apartment block, who just happens to be an expert karate practitioner. The Karate Kid can be interpreted in a number of different ways, largely because it borrows from so many different film genres. On an obvious level it is a martial arts movie. On an equally obvious level it is a high school drama, with stock characters drawn from just about every American high school film you've ever seen; Johnny, in particular, fits the arrogant jock stereotype, and his one-time girlfriend Ali is, of course, a cheerleader. On the other hand, it is also an underdog sporting drama similar to Rocky which was made by the same director John G. Avildsen. Finally, it can also (like a lot of martial arts dramas) be seen as a philosophical, quasi-religious allegory of good against evil. Daniel and Johnny have essentially learned the same fighting skills, but they have done so from teachers with quite different philosophies of life. Johnny's teacher, John Kreese, is significantly not an ethnic Japanese or even an Asian, even though he refers to his school by the Japanese term dojo and insists that his students call him sensei (Japanese for teacher). He is a white American and an Army veteran whose philosophy is based around strength and aggression. He essentially sees karate as a more efficient way of beating people up, and encourages his students to think in the same way. Concepts such as mercy, compassion and the peaceful resolution of disputes are quite alien to him. Miyagi, by contrast, is kindly and humble, believing that one should only use force as a last resort. To him studying the martial arts is not about making oneself a more efficient fighting machine but has more to do with harmony, balance and self-discipline. The final showdown between Daniel and Johnny, therefore, when they meet in the final of a local karate tournament, is as much a clash of two philosophies as a clash of two adversaries. Like many underdog films this one is both shamelessly unrealistic and shamelessly sentimental. It is, for example, unrealistic to suppose that Danny would have any hope of defeating Johnny- bigger, stronger and with a lot more previous experience of the sport- in the final of the tournament, but of course he does. (Thereby going one better than Rocky, who lost his big fight, albeit narrowly). Its sentimentality lies in its black-and-white view of morality; it goes out of its way to build Daniel and Miyagi up as the good guys and Kreese and Johnny as the bad guys. Johnny might have the partial excuse that he has been led astray by an older man who should have known better; no such excuse is available to Kreese. This favourable view of a Japanese character was perhaps unusual in the Hollywood of the eighties, a decade in which there was a lot of anti- Japanese feeling in America, mostly rooted in trade rivalry. (This feeling is perhaps reflected in some other films from the period such of Woman of Valor, one of the few traditional war films of the period, in which the Japanese are very much the villains). Even so, the scriptwriters were careful to give Miyagi a distinguished war record with the US Army in World War II, even though Pat Morita would only have been nine years old at the time of Pearl Harbor. I also found myself wondering whether (1) a first-generation Japanese immigrant in the forties would have been eligible for US citizenship or service in the US armed forces and (2) whether someone whose English-language skills are so poor could ever have been promoted to Sergeant. Quibbles like these, however, were obviously less important than the message the film-makers were trying to get across, namely that Japanese people can be good guys- provided they are also patriotic Americans. There are other plot holes; it is never, for example, explained how Miyagi, who presumably only earns a modest salary as a handyman, acquired his collection of valuable vintage cars. Overall, however, The Karate Kid is a reasonably good example of the sentimental feelgood genre, largely because of the standards of acting. Morita earned an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor (losing to another Asian actor, Haing S Ngor in The Killing Fields), and Ralph Macchio makes Daniel an engaging and likable young hero. Martin Kove is also good as the brutal, cynical Kreese, although the character struck me as being too close for comfort to the stereotypical view of the Vietnam veteran which prevailed in the eighties. Despite its theme of two conflicting philosophies of life there is nothing particularly profound about the film, but it makes for entertaining viewing. It may be shamelessly unrealistic and shamelessly sentimental, but it is also shamelessly effective. 6\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"9 November 2013","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Daniel LaRusso, a teenage boy, moves with his mother (presumably divorced, although this is never made clear) from Newark, New Jersey to Los Angeles.

I was keen on watching it again though because it was one of those films (in fact it was the first T&A movie that I ever saw) that I had watched numerous times when I was young. I guess I related to the main characters in these films, being somewhat of an outcast, though unlike these guys, never having a friend, or a group of friends, that I could fall back on (that is until I met the Dungeons and Dragons dorks at the State Library).It is interesting to look at some of the perspectives of this film, in a way the suggestion that the nerds of this film tend to (if they manage to survive high school and college) end up being much more successful than the jocks in this film. There is a lot of subtle imagery in it though, with the jocks being a part of a fraternity known as the Alpha-Betas, suggesting that they are the premier people on the campus.There are things that differ between my experience of university though because, being an Australian, campus life here is much different. Firstly we do not have fraternities or sororities. They simply do not exist. Secondly there is no faculty of sport in Australian universities, so you will not actually encounter anybody like the Alpha-Betas here.The other interesting thing about the characters in this film is that while it is reflective of campus life in the United States, it also brings to mind how many of the Alpha-Betas, being the sporting heroes, are unlikely to live out their days in luxury. Sporting heroes (and others in the entertainment industry) become millionaires, however it is the nerds and the geeks who become billionaires. However, the future is generally not at the forefront of people's mind when they are undergoing persecution. Granted, Gilbert does speak of Nerd Persecution at the end of the film, and I guess in a way it does exist, however in this film they use their brains to fight back, and they win. It is also interesting to note that the Alpha-Betas use fear to rule the campus, and it is only when that fear is broken (by everybody coming to understand that anybody who is not an Alpha-Beta, is by definition, a nerd) that the power of the Alpha-Betas is broken.However, while this film may have some place in my heart, it is still a T&A movie, and to be honest with you, I really don't find it all that funny anyway.

During this struggle, one of the gang members finds a bag of diamonds which is sought by a nasty crime syndicate. They then start murdering gang members to get these diamonds.

It was even placed 3rd greatest screenplay of all time, by the Writers Guild of America (WGA) amongst such titles as Casablanca, The Godfather and Anne Hall, which arguably I feel is the greatest of them all. Starring Jack Nicholson in what I believe to be a career defining performance, even surpassing his Oscar winning exploits with One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest and even his ever chilling performance in The Shining. Chinatown starts off as just another mundane detective TV drama, as a distraught wife; appear in Jake Gittes office requesting a private eye to solidify her suspicions of her husband's infidelity.But just like in life, nothing is ever what it seems, and just like life, Chinatown is as unpredictable as the English weather, as from that moment in the office, we suddenly swept up in a whirlwind of excitement, tensions, laughs and shocks; as we find ourselves in a ever engulfing circle, consisting of millionaire corruption, murder, sheep, farmers. But when you thought that was it we sprinkled in some incest and water scandals for good measure. As we are placed side by side with Jake on his roller coaster ride through kicks to the head, cuts to the nose and a steamy love affair with a woman Fane Dunaway also from Bonnie and Clyde) who may just be the key to his eventual downfall, helping in laying down the foundation to one of the most ironic ends in film history. They said Michelangelo had a hard time painting the sixteenth carpel in a lifetime; imagine trying to keep a piece of art like Chinatown in a review of 500 words or less, now that is a miracle. Because Chinatown is a magnificent cinematic and technical achievement that may never again be rivalled in American cinema. The film is so good, I feel that it should be compulsive watching in all film schools for all young writers and directors with dreams of a career in the film &#x96; actually better yet forget film school, just sit at home and watch Chinatown, that's the only film education you really need. So don't be a feel, stay out of school and watch Chinatown. ","genre":"Drama, Mystery, Thriller"}]
