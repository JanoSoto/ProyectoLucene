Like so many others, I went to the pictures more than once to catch the must-see film of 1997. When I first saw Titanic, I was swept away by the whole film. I thought it was a thrilling piece of entertainment. Funny, resonant and exciting in equal measure.But again, like so many others I also feel Titanic has lost a bit of its sparkle over the years. Its times like this you ask yourself why a film you once held in such high regard now ranks so low? Lets see if I can answer that question.There's no denying that on the one hand its an impressive piece of filmmaking. Cameron's direction is slick and economical, something that's served him well since his extraordinary debut with The Terminator. The 3 hour running time zips by without one barely noticing. But somewhere along the way, Cameron fumbles it, and like the Titanic, the film goes down with all hands.Cameron is a self-professed Titanic enthusiast, and he's clearly put a great deal of thought, care and precision into recreating the Titanic, from the jumbo sized pistons in the engine room right down to the tiny portholes on the bow. And he exactingly crafts its destruction, first explained to us through a step-by-step computer simulation.The collision with the iceberg. The gradual flooding of the compartments. Loss of power. The ship splits in half. The eventual sinking. And then we finally see it enacted in the last 90 minutes. It would be churlish not to mention how eerily precise Cameron gets the details of the Titanic.Its a shame the human characters aren't as well developed. Cameron's clout in the industry has allowed him to array a truly extraordinary cast. But save one or two, quite a few characters are little more than cardboard cutouts.Kate Winslet shines as Rose. She does quite well and invests a great deal of resourcefulness and spunk into the part of a débutante forced into marriage. Cameron draws a lot of strength and vitality from her character.As for Leonardo DiCaprio, he brings plenty of enthusiasm to Jack Dawson, a penniless artist from steerage. But his romance with Rose never truly convinces. The relationship only works on simplistic terms by pushing all the right emotional buttons. Exactly why it struck such a chord with audiences. Especially the female members. I remember hearing quite a few ladies in the audience reach for their tissues during Jack's rather maudlin death scene.I couldn't go into detail describing how many people there are to keep track of. Otherwise I'd run out of words. The ones that scored favourably with me are Kathy Bates as the unsinkable Molly Brown, Victor Garber as Mr Andrews the ship builder, and in a small but memorable role Jason Barry as Tommy, an Irishman in steerage who meets a tragic end.As for everyone else, they're all one-dimensional. Billy Zane is cast as Rose's fiancée Cal, a snobbish, controlling tyrant. There's no depth to his character. David Warner is wasted in a thankless role as Zane's ghoulish valet, and Frances Fisher takes the prize of worst offender for playing Ruth, Rose's heartless mother.Cameron waits quite a bit before the actual collision. So you'd be forgiven for feeling more than a little restless for the first hour and a half. There are a few moments that stand out. I quite liked the way the film contrasts the differences in 1st and 3rd class, each having dinner in their own way. And you will definitely sit up and pay attention to Jack drawing Rose in the nude wearing nothing but a priceless diamond.But its really after the crash that the film finally starts getting interesting. This is the part of the story Cameron wanted to tell. He stages the destruction of Titanic with breathtaking regard. Corridors flood with cascades of water. The enormity of the hull pivoting into the air is a terrifying sight. Its in these scenes where the film holds a captive audience. Cameron shoots them with a fanatical immediacy, and watching the destruction of these stylised and impeccably crafted sets is awesome to behold.Yet even in these scenes Cameron miscues it a little. The sinking of the Titanic has been filmed many times (A Night To Remember had to have influenced Cameron). But this is the first to add comedy into the mix. I didn't mind so much in the first half because the people aboard didn't know the maiden voyage of Titanic was doomed. But in the second half, when Cameron tries to make you laugh, its an approach at odds with the dramatic thrust of the story, e.g. the aristocrats aboard want brandies while the ship is sinking. This is hardly believable behaviour, and even disrespects the memories of those aboard. It leaves a bad taste in the mouth.Cameron does demonstrate far too much of a willingness to guess what the people aboard were like. Painting them in unfavourable colours, portraying the officers as officious bureaucrats, and even having one of them shooting passengers even when there is no evidence to support that.The final scenes for Jack and Rose go on too long in my opinion. His final words, which are really hackneyed and mawkish belong more in a soap opera, not a multi-million dollar feature film. The image of a floating necropolis is striking though.Titanic is certainly an oddity. Its a film that people embraced as a whole the world over, and now they go out they're way to find fault with it. I didn't go looking for faults. They surfaced as time went by because it just doesn't hold up too well to repeated viewings. I still think you should see Titanic, even if in a few years it probably won't do for you what it used to.

It's easy to assume that anything Brad Pitt is in is going to be some sort of mushy, generic love comedy of some sort, although films like Twelve Monkeys and Snatch often prove otherwise. But, with Julia Roberts also starring it seemed to really want to go down that path; however, pleasingly it didn't.The Mexican is the kind of film that relies on its quirky little sequences and scenes rather than a ground breaking plot or this or that. The character of Jerry Welbach (Pitt) is a gangster's lackey who comes off as far too bumbling to be any good at his job for a respected crime boss whatsoever but we are, in a way, fooled into thinking that this guy is actually a bit of a 'blagger' which means that whatever the situation he can often trick his way through it. This is also put across in a very early scene when he's arguing with his girlfriend Samantha (Roberts) who's up on a balcony as he's below; desperately trying to rectify a situation.This is where the film splits into two different types of film. Through Jerry's bumbling, Samantha gets an encounter from a heavy connected with Jerry's employer called Leroy(Gandolfini) and a separate plot opens up with them. Now, we have their road movie exploits and Jerry's comedy happening the other side of the American border giving us one or the other to map onto. Whereas Jerry trying to retrieve an ancient gun, that's importance is put across to us through amusing and at times tragic flashbacks, is more of a slapstick affair &#150; the road movie segment is relies on actual humour coming off the script. Even if it is a bit weak on most occasions, tiny things like lines including Will you rape me? &#150; Not likely as well as a sequence where the two and a homosexual hitchhiker they picked up are all jumping around on a bed to a cheesy sounding pop song are good examples of what to expect- not funny but not expected and if it doesn't make you laugh, it will advance the characters in a neat little way.Where The Mexican fails to become a truly great film is in its final hurrah. The last third is the weakest and this is a shame as the foundation had been set for an entertaining, well made and well thought out road drama turned comedy with an element of love and gangster thrown in. What the film does to contribute to its own downfall is that it, to me, suddenly changes genre. What was a gangster crime story suddenly turns into a bit of a mis-adventure, 'Indiana Jones' type of a film where the ancient pistol MacGuffin every one's been chasing takes over as the sole focus. Now, instead of having Jerry of here; Samantha and Leroy on a road trip over there &#150; we have loads of other characters we caught glimpses of appearing from nowhere and suddenly getting involved.What's even more disappointing is that the film starts its downfall early on into the final third so the last forty minutes are very disappointing as it becomes messy, un-funny and as I said &#150; it turns into a bit of a B-movie adventure film akin to Indiana Jones than what it started off as which was the opposite.The Mexican still has its moments. Its moments include love, loss, tragedy, comedy, gangster shootouts and slapstick and for a film able to pack all of this into a semi-road movie, semi-cause and effect detective hunt has to be worth at least a look.

It's easy to assume that anything Brad Pitt is in is going to be some sort of mushy, generic love comedy of some sort, although films like Twelve Monkeys and Snatch often prove otherwise. But, with Julia Roberts also starring it seemed to really want to go down that path; however, pleasingly it didn't.The Mexican is the kind of film that relies on its quirky little sequences and scenes rather than a ground breaking plot or this or that. The character of Jerry Welbach (Pitt) is a gangster's lackey who comes off as far too bumbling to be any good at his job for a respected crime boss whatsoever but we are, in a way, fooled into thinking that this guy is actually a bit of a 'blagger' which means that whatever the situation he can often trick his way through it. This is also put across in a very early scene when he's arguing with his girlfriend Samantha (Roberts) who's up on a balcony as he's below; desperately trying to rectify a situation.This is where the film splits into two different types of film. Through Jerry's bumbling, Samantha gets an encounter from a heavy connected with Jerry's employer called Leroy(Gandolfini) and a separate plot opens up with them. Now, we have their road movie exploits and Jerry's comedy happening the other side of the American border giving us one or the other to map onto. Whereas Jerry trying to retrieve an ancient gun, that's importance is put across to us through amusing and at times tragic flashbacks, is more of a slapstick affair &#150; the road movie segment is relies on actual humour coming off the script. Even if it is a bit weak on most occasions, tiny things like lines including Will you rape me? &#150; Not likely as well as a sequence where the two and a homosexual hitchhiker they picked up are all jumping around on a bed to a cheesy sounding pop song are good examples of what to expect- not funny but not expected and if it doesn't make you laugh, it will advance the characters in a neat little way.Where The Mexican fails to become a truly great film is in its final hurrah.

Its a fantastic, original and suspenseful action thriller pitting a suspended and very hung-over Detective John McLane with marital issues against an elusive enemy calling himself Simon. McClane is about to have a very bad day and Simon wants McClane to play a game, 'Simon Says' or he is going to set off another bomb in a very public place. Racing through New York City, leaping onto subway trains, dodging gunfire, and jumping through hoops for a psychopath McCLane unwittingly picks up Zeus Carver, a racist shop-owner played masterfully by Samuel L Jackson who is drawn into the action.Vengeance in essence is a direct sequel to the first Die Hard only totally different. Its not Christmas, and its not confined to a building but John McTiernan is back to direct and its like he never left because the grit, intensity, and attitude of the original Die Hard is ever present and though Hans Gruber is long dead Jeremy Irons does more than enough to carry the weight of a worthy advisory to McClane whose one step shy of becoming a full-blown alcoholic. The quips are there, the one-liners, the German bad guys, the foul language and non-stop action.The supporting cast and many extras of Vengeance are also great. Vengeance is an ode to New York and there are long periods without any McClane, Jackson or Irons which only serve to make the movie stronger and setup the explosive finale. But the real winner here is truly the banter and chemistry between the two leads and the sidekick formula completely works here and is a welcome break from the McClane being alone in a confined place scenario. Overall this is my favourite rendition of John McClane who hasn't missed a beat and it's a great performance from Bruce Willis in a role he knows so well. The ending doesn't quite live up to the rest of the movie but there's enough here to warrant a true classic in my opinion as Vengeance's re-watch value is very high. I loved it.Nine out of ten.

I found Pulp Fiction to be the perfect film to use as an example of all of the points i wish to make.A movie is much like any other piece of art, whether it is a sculpture, painting, etc. You need to open your mind and let it speak to you through your own interpretation. I've been told by some people that Pulp Fiction has no story line and is completely meaningless. It isn't going to be spoon fed to you. God forbid you have to think a little when you watch a film and you have to form some of your own conclusions.For those who watched this movie and didn't find it to have meaning, let ME spoon feed it to you. Pulp Fiction explores four major themes and does so through the use of multiple, sometimes inter-weaving, stories. The main themes are Friendship, Loyalty, Love (specifically forbidden love), and Revelation. Friendship is characterized through the words AND ACTIONS (not ALL dialouge like you'd like it to be) of Jules (Samuel L. Jackson) and Vincent (John Travolta). They play two partners in a crime syndicate and through certain events throughout their story, their friendship grows to new levels. Their constant bickering and arguing through the film shows their getting to know one another better and look at life through a different perspective.Loyalty is portrayed through Butch's (Bruce Willace) story. He has the most open ended story of them all because it really make you wonder what happens next, but you are forced to use your imagination. His character is given a business proposition which he takes into his own hands and slightly foreshadows his ability to possibly form his own crime syndicate (but by the independancy of his character this seems unlikely).Forbidden Love is the meaning behind Vincent and Mia's (Uma Thurman) tale. I've heard from many that this was the most pointless story of them all and i wish to have you rethink that. She is the wife of a crime boss, and he works for this boss. The thought of their love for one another was so unthinkable in their situation that it had to be expressed through actions (hence the word ACTING). A prime example was the cinematically infamous twist scene. It showed the parallel rhythm of their souls for the lack of a better word and portrayed their completion of one another.And finally, Revelation. The closing point of the film. It starts with the life-altering event (for Jules at least) of not being hit by a single bullet shot at him. Even at that one moment he almost immediately rethinks his whole outlook on life and decides to retire. But this is only the beginning. The most powerful scene in the film is in the diner at the end. Jewels spreads his message of life and appreciation to two small time crooks who decide to rob the diner and its customers. Through a very deep and proactive monologue delivered by Samuel L. Jackson, the robber only known as Pumpkin (Tim Roth) is left speechless and in awe as he walked away with his wife and went home, hopefully to start an new life.I hope this helped you further appreciate this cinematic masterpiece and also help you realize the importance of watching movies, or any art form, with an open mind and with imagination. Do not always dismiss something you don't understand as meaningless, in everyday life as well, for that is the ignorance this world decays from everyday.

I found Pulp Fiction to be the perfect film to use as an example of all of the points i wish to make.A movie is much like any other piece of art, whether it is a sculpture, painting, etc. You need to open your mind and let it speak to you through your own interpretation. I've been told by some people that Pulp Fiction has no story line and is completely meaningless. It isn't going to be spoon fed to you. God forbid you have to think a little when you watch a film and you have to form some of your own conclusions.For those who watched this movie and didn't find it to have meaning, let ME spoon feed it to you. Pulp Fiction explores four major themes and does so through the use of multiple, sometimes inter-weaving, stories. The main themes are Friendship, Loyalty, Love (specifically forbidden love), and Revelation. Friendship is characterized through the words AND ACTIONS (not ALL dialouge like you'd like it to be) of Jules (Samuel L. Jackson) and Vincent (John Travolta). They play two partners in a crime syndicate and through certain events throughout their story, their friendship grows to new levels. Their constant bickering and arguing through the film shows their getting to know one another better and look at life through a different perspective.Loyalty is portrayed through Butch's (Bruce Willace) story. He has the most open ended story of them all because it really make you wonder what happens next, but you are forced to use your imagination. His character is given a business proposition which he takes into his own hands and slightly foreshadows his ability to possibly form his own crime syndicate (but by the independancy of his character this seems unlikely).Forbidden Love is the meaning behind Vincent and Mia's (Uma Thurman) tale.

It is just opinion, which you may find agreement, or you may reject. Likewise, Mr. Stone should have had the honesty to provide a disclaimer warning the viewer to beware of suppositions, conjecture and fantasizing.Like any Catholic, American schoolboy of Irish descent, at 14 years of age in 1960, I was very proud to see the Gentleman from Massachusetts, Senator John F. Kennedy win the Democrat Party's nomination and subsequent election to the Office of President. Little did we know that it would be just a little more than 3 years later that we would bear witness to his murder.And even though in the interim between the 2 events, I found myself steadily changing my Political Sympathies. My born and bred Democrat leanings gave way to a solid belief and active Conservative Political participation. That is to whatever small participation allowed to by a guy my age. I would be 18 at the time of the 1964 Presidential Election, at a period of time when one had to be 21 in order to vote.Anyway, even though this young Irish-German, Catholic lad was now a supporter of Senator Barry M. Goldwater(R., AZ) for the Chief Executive job, I. like most Americans, felt as if some one had kicked the living guts right out of me when President Kennedy was murdered. The events of that fateful day and the days following, left America with such a feeling of Personal as well as National tragedy, loss and grief. It was as if a member of one's own family was suddenly, and without any logical reason,taken from life on Planet Earth.This is a feeling that is quite prevalent across the board for all living and old enough to remember those days.Unlike a lot of people of my own Conservative Political persuasion, I do reject the finding of the Warren Commission. Whereas I do not buy the notion that Lee Harvey Oswald was the assassin of President Kennedy, and did so by himself. There is just too much that does not compute! It made no sense then, it makes no sense now! In the years since that time in Camelot, I've spent most of my adult life as 'the Man', 'the Heat', 'the Fuzz', well you get it, I was a Chicago Cop for nearly 35 years, having experience in assignment=ts to the Patrol Division, the Traffic Division, the Youth Division and finally the Detective Division. This surely acted to heighten my sense of suspicion and cynicism about current events, the media covering them and how some special interests can and do slant a story to read as they want it. (Honest Injun! Don't be Shocked, Please!!) Now in spite of all of this disbelief in the findings of the Warren Commission and discounting all the other writings that have sprouted up like mushrooms after a thunderstorm, I must register a negative opinion of JFK and will be happy to give my reasons as to just why.First of all, let's start off by saying, without reservation, that JFK is a tremendous example of the exposition of the Cinematic Arts & Sciences at their very zenith of their powers. The photography, the editing, the use of nonsequitors is all so very well done as to draw the viewer into the story right from the very start. Cutting quickly between scenes and overlapping dialog adds to the certain feeling of reality. Furthering this realism is the use of certain scenes which quickly follow a revelation or supposition* of a behind the scenes happening. These 'follow-up', supporting scenes, are often filmed in a diminished color, or a B & W with a dark-shadowed background. The dialog is spoken in short, fast-paced little clips in voices impersonating a well-known person involved in the whole mess.(e.g. Lyndon Johnson) This is then blurred with overlapping dialog from the previous ex positional scene. All tension is heightened by using abrupt, shrill and louder musical queues.The result is very effective as a dramatic tool, but can be very deceiving to the senses, unconsciously gaining influence on the very last part of one's thought process to fall to sensory stimulation and mood manipulation, your logic. In a real sense, a story like this actually mesmerizes the viewer. That is it has a hypnotic effect.As a work of monumental effort and mammoth efforts in the story telling tradition of the cinema, this certainly deserving of an A or even an A+ grade.But we find that there is just too much of a recurring use of innuendo, supposition, conjecture and embellishment of occurrences following the assassination. The Film Maker, Extremist Left Wing Liberal Democrat, Director Oliver Stone, bends the truth just once too often and a little too much. For these reasons, this writer cannot and will not, endorse this movie. The sum of all the contrived scenes, stacked on on top another equals just a dishonest instrument of influence.And here in Chicago, and just about anywhere else, that means it's a F*cking lie!

This in itself was disappointing as this 'Wendigo' was just a bizarre mix of a tree and a stag. Everything about the movie was uninspiring.The parents of the little boy appeared to be rather aloof and at times seemed completely detached from their son. Whether this was down to bad acting or a bad script I'm not sure, but it only heightened my disappointment and boredom levels.There was no food for thought, nothing to pique an interest. With no real intrigue or chill factor, this movie creaked along so painfully, you just couldn't care less what happened by the end.Wendigo's ambiance reminds me of the dull movie shown at the awards ceremony toward the end of 'Mr Bean's Holiday' a movie which is artistic and nonsensical, trying too hard to to be deep and meaningful, but coming across as pretentious and boring.I would never want to watch this again. I only watched it to the end in the vain hope that something interesting might happen ... but it didn't.

This in itself was disappointing as this 'Wendigo' was just a bizarre mix of a tree and a stag. Everything about the movie was uninspiring.The parents of the little boy appeared to be rather aloof and at times seemed completely detached from their son. Whether this was down to bad acting or a bad script I'm not sure, but it only heightened my disappointment and boredom levels.There was no food for thought, nothing to pique an interest. With no real intrigue or chill factor, this movie creaked along so painfully, you just couldn't care less what happened by the end.Wendigo's ambiance reminds me of the dull movie shown at the awards ceremony toward the end of 'Mr Bean's Holiday' a movie which is artistic and nonsensical, trying too hard to to be deep and meaningful, but coming across as pretentious and boring.I would never want to watch this again. I only watched it to the end in the vain hope that something interesting might happen ... but it didn't.

Blow by the way is another expression for cocaine. Based on the true story of the rise and fall of the biggest cocaine importer of the 1970's, this film sees George Jung (Johnny Depp) living his life and making a living in drug selling and smuggling. He grew up quite well with a loving father, Fred (Ray Liotta), who would do almost anything for him, and it pretty much from him that he got interested in the drugs business. The film doesn't exactly have much plot, it is basically just Depp selling and smuggling some drugs, going to prison for possession, having parole, having a daughter with wife Mirtha (Penélope Cruz), and all his success goes down the drain because of many losses. Also starring Franka Potente as Barbara, Rachel Griffiths as Ermine Jung, Paul Reubens (aka Pee-Wee Herman) as Derek Foreal, Jordi Mollà as Diego Delgado, Cliff Curtis as Pablo Escobar, Miguel Sandoval as Augusto Oliveras and My Name Is Earl's Ethan Suplee as Tuna.

Basically middle-aged book editor Will Randall (Jack Nicholson) is one night driving on a snowy road at night, and he hits a large wolf, who wakes up and slashes him on the hand. A little while later he seems fine and is back to work, and attending parties, where he meets the attractive Laura Alden (Michelle Pfeiffer). Soon though Will starts to feel different, he feels younger, better sense of smell and hearing, and gets more aggressive, particularly towards the man he discovers has been having an affair with his wife, Stewart Swinton (Secretary's James Spader). Eventually, at full moon, Will turns into what he was hoping to avoid, a vicious howling werewolf (that doesn't take or rip his clothes, makes a change). Ripping Stewart also makes another werewolf, and they both clash towards the end fighting for Laura. In the end, Will (as a werewolf, unprotected by a special bracelet) runs off, and Laura is now alone, and the final shot sees her eyes go green, so it's obvious she's one too. Also starring Kate Nelligan as Charlotte Randall, Richard Jenkins as Det. Bridger, Christopher Plummer as Raymond Alden, Eileen Atkins as Mary, Frasier's David Hyde Pierce as Roy, East Is East's Om Puri as Dr. Vijay Alezias, Fawlty Towers' Prunella Scales as Maude and David Schwimmer as a Cop. As I mentioned it is predictable, but the performances are good, and Nicholson looks like a man who would turn into a werewolf (with narrow eyes, curved eye brows and that hair line). Worth watching!
