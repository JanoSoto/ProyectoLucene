What's an American accent doing in the middle of all this? Malkovitch also seems to be channeling his own performance in Frear's masterpiece, Dangerous Liaisons - but if you haven't seen that film you should love what he does in this one.But other than that, I found the slow pace to be totally gripping... The entire story is told from the viewpoint of Mary Reilly, and I have never seen Julia Roberts do a better job than here.

The film is dark and psychologically disturbing throughout while also dealing with issues of sexism and strength. Director Jonathan Demme's adaptation of Thomas Harris' best-selling novel swept across the globe in 1991, eventually winning five Academy Awards and becoming a prestigious topic of discussion among critics.Its moody influence crept across the popular 90s sub-genre of 'serial-thriller'. This lent The Silence of the Lambs a growing reputation for being an adult thriller of horror ike capabilities. The mythically monstrous and deliciously manipulative Hannibal Lecter became an immediate household name and now remains among the most popular fictitious villains in modern cinema. Such a figure could only be played by one man (has it become unimaginable to picture it any other way?) that man being Anthony Hopkins, who slipped himself into the role with matchless prestige, therefore giving birth to a cultural icon of both literature and cinema.The movie starts with Agent Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) who is an FBI trainee, being called up from her classes to acquire information from a serial killer, Dr.Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins), about a current killer known as Buffalo Bill. Bill is a man who wishes to be a transsexual but has been turned down for sex reassignment because of his volatility. Starling acquires a sort of cordial relationship with Lecter, who wishes her to divulge personal information about herself in return for his assistance with the case. The film is tense throughout. Scott Glenn turns in a pretty good performance as a director of the FBI division that Starling is entering. Lecter is chilling as he gives Starling information about Buffalo Bill and the Senator's daughter who has been kidnapped by Bill. The film is extremely suspenseful, I felt like yelling at the screen to tell me what was going to happen next. The suspense is most definitely on account of the film's taking you through out the twists and turns of your own psyche.The acting is one of the most crucial aspects of the film. Since the film only revolves around a few characters a big cast of mixed stars in not necessary. Instead, the quality over quantity formula works exceptionally well. Anthony Hopkins got best actor award despite being confined to only seventeen minutes of screen time. He does his best in every scene and practically pours his heart as he makes such a realistic and haunting performance.However Hannibal would obviously be a complete waste without Jodie Foster giving an equally impressive performance. She has a nice south American accent with a good amount of innocence to her. She is desperate to find Bill but has a weird relationship with Hannibal along the way. Ted Levine is the last major character in this film and probably the whole reason why everything happens. He doesn't have much screen time but still manages to put on a creepy and believable performance. He is somewhat humorous but still manages to remain sinister.The Silence of the lambs works for a lot of factors. The cast plays a big part and so is the mood, setting, and cinematography. The movie is very dark most of the time and the cinematography complements this perfectly. The detail to the scenes works well as the setting is creepy and suspenseful. Hannibal's jail cells are nicely designed and contain a lot of aspects that show his character nicely. The movie keeps an excellent balance of suspense and drama. It is suspenseful throughout but has a nice dramatic element that is lacking in many films today. The climax is pulse pounding and the film has excellent closure that has it come full circle.Even the DVD cover scares me. I would NOT recommend this for children obviously!!!!

The climax is pulse pounding and the film has excellent closure that has it come full circle.Even the DVD cover scares me. I would NOT recommend this for children obviously!!!!

Things get off to a great start with the teaser, although it is probably the most outrageous part of the film it still works tremendously well, as Bond encounters Blofeld again and we see him visiting his deceased wife's grave (anything which recognizes On Her Majesty's Secret Service is good). It is in many ways the sequence which should have opened Diamonds are Forever. I find it plays much better following On Her Majesty's Secret Service than that film does.Although he's looking a bit old for the part by this film, this is easily Moore's best outing as Bond. He shows an edge and physicality that is missing from most of the films in his era, and surprises me every time as I have a habit of generalizing and forgetting this film when I criticize his portrayal of Bond and\/or the writing for the character during his era. For Your Eyes Only is refreshingly uninterested in gadgetry and silliness, focusing on well-orchestrated chases and fistfights, which provide easily the best action scenes of the Moore era. John Glen's debut as director displays confidence and talent, and a good eye for composition and visual narrative. He would become lazy on some later films, but when he's on form he's one of the best directors to work on the Bond films. This script is really refreshing after the constant attack of ultra-juvenile and embarrassing sex jokes (even by Bond standards) and silliness that was Moonraker. The comic relief here works quite well other than the annoying Bibi played by Lynn-Holly Johnson, and the parrot at the end of the movie, and the film's plot is not bad given how it serves as little more than a loose framework for the spectacular action scenes. I rather like the Bill Conti score, as well, although I recognize that I am in a minority there.For Your Eyes Only is the best Roger Moore Bond film, and features Moore's best performance as Bond.

In this movie, he is featured as the co-star to Jack Nicholson. Garfunkel's character goes through the ordinary changes of a professional class man from college through middle age. He is married, but grows weary of his bossy, perfectionist wife. Nicholson's character is really a study in conflict. Although not visibly despicable, Nicholson's character is a sex addict doomed to failure and destruction of other people's lives. He doesn't want to hurt people, but does. Ann Margaret is good as a beautiful model\/commercial actress, who is slowly ruined by Nicholson's lust only for sex and uncaring attitude about her personal, human side. In the end, Nicholson grows into a sick middle aged man, who can only talk wistfully about all his conquests in life. However, he is addicted to sex, and it rules his life. This is kind of an unusual movie for the early 70s. It is the opposite of the libertarian values of the day. It is a critical look at relationships that was more in vogue during the 80s and 90s. The movie falls short, because it tries to tell a story about two very differing friends in an entertaining way. However, by tackling such a complex subject as human sexuality and deviancy, it leaves out a lot. We never get to really understand what in the Nicholson character's life made him the way he was.

But then ITV just did the peculiar thing of showing it today. And at Easter no less! Oh well, there wasn't much else on TV, so I decided to watch Ron Howard's lovingly crafted tribute to Dr Seuss's most famous fictional character.I remember whiling away many hours of my childhood on the gleeful, charming absurdities of Dr Seuss. The Cat in the Hat and Green Eggs and Ham were perennial favourites of mine. And of course, so was How the Grinch Stole Christmas.And what an anarchic children's story it is. The tale of a lovably wicked creature, the Grinch who hates everything and anything to do with Christmas. Living on the top of Mt Crumpit, he loathes and despises the people of Whoville, who act like its Christmas everyday. So he hatches a plan to ruin Christmas for the people he looks down on, by stealing their presents right out from under their noses (and boy do they have noses!) on Christmas Eve.Now of course the book is a very slim affair, so Ron Howard has to expand upon a few things. He even gives us a Grinch back-story. But unfortunately, the film version disappoints. Although a visual treat, the appealing wickedness of the story book has become buried by the A-list machinery of the sets and production values.I don't think Ron Howard was the director to bring the world of Dr Seuss to life. What the film really needed was someone like Tim Burton at the helm. In fact I can't think of a filmmaker more suited to Dr Seuss' sensibilities. Some of the films he's made are clearly akin to the mind of Dr Seuss. The Nightmare Before Christmas is a perfect example. A film that achieved a perfect balance between the grotesque and the sincere. As well as his recent remake of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.Ron Howard's films are ones designed to appeal to the Academy Award winning crowd. Ones that celebrate the strength of the human spirit. He hasn't really got the wacky imagination to let the world of Dr Seuss truly come to life. And while he's clearly put a great deal of thought into the world of Whoville, the film still looks very stagebound. Everything is crammed in as tightly as possible. From squashed in bungalows to tiny fieldmice. The film would be a glossy, empty confection, were it not for one thing......Jim Carrey. Now Jim Carrey can be an intensely annoying actor. Especially when he goes over the top. His antics have sunk many a film on his resume. Batman Forever, The Cable Guy and Liar Liar are all prime examples. Where the directors of those films foolishly refused to rein him in. So its all the more surprising than that Jim Carrey does just brilliantly as The Grinch.This is one of the greatest performances he has ever delivered. Like the one other really good manic character he's played, The Mask, his OTT excesses feel completely appropriate. Where in the other films I mentioned, Carrey was put into roles that didn't really suit his typically out of control theatrics, he gets it very right as The Grinch.The Grinch is a character that seems perfectly attuned to Carrey's manic energy. Much like The Mask. And Ron Howard seems to sense that too. Which is why he allows him to give a performance of zero restraint. And as a result reaches stratospheric heights.Buried under an impressive makeover by the excellent Rick Baker, Carrey is a thundering cyclone. Hopping about with energy, clearly enjoying himself immensely, he is the life and soul of the party. Whenever he's around, you sit up and pay attention (not hard considering he's green all over).I don't envy him either. The hours he must have had to spend in the makeup chair. Those contact lenses must have been torture. But it never shows through in his performance. His enthusiasm for the role shines right through the makeup. And its animated enough to allow him plenty of mischievous grins and lopsided smirks. Giving a sharp, edgy take on the role, Carrey makes The Grinch one of his most memorable creations.What is especially gratifying about the way Jim Carrey plays The Grinch is the fact that even as he softens, he never loses his edge. Yes he does come to understand the spirit of Christmas, but there's still a bit of a grouch left in The Grinch. One particularly delightful moment comes when his heart grows a few inches. His faithful dog Max jumps into his lap licking him mercilessly expecting high praise. Instead he gets a harsh rebuke Beat it! One step at a time!Jim Carrey is the best thing in the whole film. The rest of the cast don't have a prayer of keeping up with him. He's the sole reason to watch the film at all. There's something tremendously satisfying (not to mention liberating) watching him tear down the superficial, hollow shell of Whoville. Its a pity he repents on that because Whoville looks better without all the adornments.You're never in any doubt who's behind the makeup, but Carrey makes The Grinch large as life. With lots of pithy, spiteful dialogue to spout as well as neverending insults and putdowns, Carrey does a superb job of bringing The Grinch to the big screen.Its just a shame the rest of the film isn't as good. It'll be interesting to see how Carrey does in the latest Dr Seuss film, Horton Hears a Who! Since he's an actor who seems very in sync with Seuss, I'm sure he'll be just as good there.

Watching it again years later it didn't have quite the same effect on me but it still holds it's own as a cult classic. First of all you have the benefit of the original short story being written by one of the greatest modern day writers of our time...Stephen King. And although Children of The Corn strays a little from the typical Stephen King recipe there are still a lot of things in tact from his usual genre. Isolation, disturbing religious fanaticism, an unsuspecting hero making a change in his or her life. The idea behind Children of the Corn is just downright disturbing and the portrayals of the children and their twisted world will keep you riveted. They do a terrific job of making sure you understand this strange religion they are involved in but still leave a certain element of mystery to it which is great. The film balances horror with a psychological aspect and despite a low budget and some terrible special effects the film is a classic.Multi talented actor director and producer Peter Horton plays the lead hero in one of his very early roles. Horton is really terrific in the role. He has a certain amount of down to earth quality while still maintaining this touch exterior that makes him a worthy hero. He has this level of intensity to him and he really does a great job. I'm kind of surprised this role didn't gain him more big screen main roles. Probably minutes before changing the world as tough as nails screen hero Sarah Connor Linda Hamilton played the more soft spoken Vicky. We know now what kind of a screen presence she can be and she's kind of underplayed as more of the damsel in distress in this film. Her and Horton are a great couple and have good chemistry and the thing with both of them is that they are very down to earth and very believable. They are just average people in an extraordinary circumstance. John Franklin is kind of the mascot of the series and this film as enraged god-filled Issac. His role is kind of subtle but he's so important and really does make a difference in his role and didn't return to the series until fifteen years later but this first performance was his claim to fame. He fits the role perfectly. Starting a very lucrative career in this first role is Courtney Gains as the deranged killer Malachai. His performance is probably the highlight of the film and is really the true villain since Franklin's character never actually performs any violence against anyone. It's a shame the character of Malachai didn't return in future installments and especially Gains in the role because he was awesome.There were a few things that really make me love this film. First of all the empty town...I love the whole isolation and wiped out apocalyptic feel and they do a good job with small shots of empty stores and such. I also think they do a terrific job with explosions in the film considering the special effects they use for 'He Who Walks Behind The Rows' is simply god awful period. It's terrible...one of the worst effects I've ever seen but it's tolerable since they don't use it a lot. Although apparently not it's original ending I really did like where they went with the ending because it breaks the mold of the typical slasher horror flick where you're practically guaranteed not all of the main characters will live and Children of The Corn actually gives you more of an action film type happy ending and I liked that. Regardless of what some think the film is a cult classic for a reason and I will always fondly remember it as one of my favorites. 8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"21 March 2008","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" In the mid to late nineties I suddenly became completely enamored with the Horror Genre, especially the 70's and 80's and the horror films that spawned sequel upon sequel...no matter how bad...I was a sucker and this was one of my all time favorites.

In the right hands, this predictable but dependable formula of sex, violence, witty dialogue, elaborate plotting, and epic villainy rarely misses. Comparatively, The World Is Not Enough shares the spirit of On Her Majesty's Secret Service and Octopussy. All Bond movies are alike, of course, but this escapade differs in its gallery of villains, its serpentine plotting, and its elegant but aggressive verve. The imaginative screenplay by Neal Purvis, Robert Wade, and Bruce Feirstein features dramatic bedrock. Although the filmmakers have dispersed the usual spectacular special effects and high octane action stunts throughout TWINE, strong, solid characters and an interesting plot are what hold this actioneer together. Unlike the sinewy Tomorrow Never Dies, Twine unfolds with a seamless grace instead of as a string of impressive episodes lashed together by an acrobatic plot. Happily, story takes precedence here. If you're not careful, the surprises may actually catch you by surprise.Naturally, the villains operate on a grand scale. For the record, TWINE weaves a mysterious web about nuclear terrorists out to destroy an unfinished oil pipeline across Western Asia to Istanbul. First, they blow-up petroleum tycoon Sir Robert King (David Calder of TV's sci-fi series Star Cops) right under 007's nose in an explosive assassination in the heart of MI 6's headquarters in London. Second, they go gunning for Sir Robert's gorgeous daughter, Elektra (Sophie Marceau). Initially, M (Judi Dench) doesn't want James Bond protecting Elektra because he injured himself during a hot pursuit of the assassin who killed Sir Robert. Bond seduces the spy agency doctor and receives a clean bill of health, so M reluctantly assigns a vengeful 007 to serve as Elektra's bodyguard. The assassins appear in droves. Bond still nurses a dislocated collarbone from his first bout with these brigands in the dazzling pre-credit action sequence. The boat chase that occurs down the Thames near MI 6 HQ after Sir Robert is blown to bits gets TWINE off to a rip-roaring start. 007 steers a special mini-rocket powered speed boat that allows him to turn aerial flips and submerge to avoid hitting water barriers. He tries to capture the murderous hit lady, but she commits suicide in a hot air balloon while Bond dangles beneath her on a tether. Putting a bullet into one of the balloon's propulsion canisters, she atomizes herself. Bond falls and dislocates his collarbone when he bounces off the roof of a building. This physical flaw lends his 007 a modicum of vulnerability and something for the wily villains to exploit. Meanwhile, as 007's ruthless opponent, Reynard (Robert Carlyle of The Full Monty) has survived a prior execution attempt by MI 6. Apparently, 009 put a bullet in Reynard's brain, but the resilient bad guy keeps on going. The slug severed Reynard's nerves, so he feels no pain and grows stronger than ever! Reynard plans to steal a nuclear device and smuggle it on board a Russian submarine as a part of his diabolical plot. Robbie Coltrane, who first appeared in GoldenEye as the hefty criminal mastermind Valentin Zukovsky, returns as the same character in a much larger, more forceful role.The action scenes are better than ever, and Bond finds himself in some truly tough spots. The snow chase where a squadron of parahawks, parachute sailing boats with skis equipped with machine guns, attack 007 is the stuff of which adrenalin is made. At one point, Bond uses one of his tricks from OHMSS to fool the villains and send them over the snow cliff. In another scene, helicopters equipped with huge buzz saws that can slice through metal objects like a blow-torch through butter come after our hero.Director Michael (Gorillas in the Mist) Apt gives everybody in TWINE a chance to display their thespian talents. Pierce Brosnan shows why he is still playing Bond. He brings even greater depth and presence to the role than he did in his first two outings. Brosnan has developed a signature gesture for his James Bond that he employed with great success in GoldenEye during the tank chase. At the appropriate moment, the dapper 007 adjusts the knot of his tie at this throat. Indeed, Bond tangles with a tough, vicious bunch, but his ability to improvise gives him an edge. These villains give Bond a real run for his money.As the evil Reynard, Carlyle resembles Darth Vader with his helmet removed, but this gifted English actor invests his villain with more emotional resonance than the usual Bond baddie. Because he is slowly dying from the bullet in this brain, Reynard fears nobody and nothing. Meanwhile, Sophie Marceau excels as Bond's shady leading lady. Electra King has more strength and substance than the typical Bond girl. As James Bond's girl Friday, Denise Richards continues the trend begun in GoldenEye that the women are not only good looking but intelligent. Dr. Christmas Jones, a high level nuclear weapons expert, helps Bond out of a tight scrape or two. The best news is that the story gives Judi Dench her biggest role as M. She makes the most of her first opportunity to venture out of her inner sanctum into the dangerous world of 007.The World Is Not Enough qualifies as a top-notch thrillathon of bullets, babes, bad guys, and Bond, James Bond!

This was in order to get food for him and his nine year-old sister Rosella, Amenda Borden,during the hight of the Great Depression. In fact Young was involved in a number of robberies and burglaries that ended with a robbery, and murder of the proprietor, of a bakery in Oregon and then followed by a failed bank robbery in Washington State. Sent to Alcatraz in 1935 to serve his time on January 13, 1939 Young together with a number of fellow inmates made an unsuccessful escape attempt from the Rock where the leader of the group Arthur Doc Barker, Michael Melvin was gunned down and killed by the prison guards. Sent to the hole for punishment Young developed a festering hatred toward his fellow inmate who was involved with him in the failed escaped attempt Rufus McCain, David Michael Sterling. Young held McCain responsible, in his unfounded suspicion of him, for tipping off the guards in Young and his fellow inmates escape plan.Out off the hole and in with the local prison population Young, after an unsuccessful attempt earlier, attacked McCain in the prison tailor shop and stabbed him with a sank, home-made prison knife, killing him Not in the mess-hall with a spoon like depicted in the movie.The most egregious misrepresentation in the film Murder in the First of Youngs stay in Alcatraz is that he was assigned a young lawyer, who just passed the state bar, to defend him in his trial for McCain's murder James Stamphill, Christian Slater.

One of the highs is found in the amazing cast that so naturally portrayed what was a set of challenging roles. Al Pacino is not only convincing, but in his lunacy and rhythm finds a way to charm us with his wit and the natural quality he manages to give his character. His male lover Leon makes another convincing short presentation that never makes us doubt about the truly dysfunctional lifestyle they have. Sonny's partner Sal played wonderfully by the late John Cazale speaks with the same frailty and emotional instability he gave his famous Godfather character. The movie does well to seem natural, far from the flamboyance that tends to haunt Hollywood when making films about cops trying to take down bad guys. The 2 hour long film also keeps you at the edge of your seat, giving you sufficient thrills along the road to keep you guessing and wishing for the best. The only criticism I have are the unnecessary shots of New York City at different moments in the movie as if watching Manhattan will helps us understand anything more about the movie and its characteristic New York characters.

Sergio Leone's 'Dollar' films range among my all-time favorites (especially The Good, The Bad And The Ugly), and Eastwood continued to be the epitome of coolness in Dirty Harry and its successors. His work as a director is impressive, High Plains Drifter (1973), The Outlaw Josey Wales (1976), and Unforgiven (1993) are my personal favorites of the films Eastwood has directed, and other films of his, such as Pale Rider, or more recently Mystic River are also very impressive. Having expressed my respect and admiration for this great actor and director, I must say that his directorial debut Play Misty For Me of 1973 is slightly overrated, in my opinion. Not that it was a bad film - on the contrary The film has some great elements. The performances are great, the locations impressive and I personally also liked the jazzy score a lot. Also, the 'stalking'-topic is interesting, especially for a time when stalking was not yet an issue as it is today. Nevertheless, I was a bit disappointed with Play Misty For Me, not least due to its reputation as a cult-favorite and essential thriller of the early 70s.Dave Garver (Eastwood) is a popular radio disc-jockey in Carmel, California. After picking up a seductive woman named Evelyn (Jessica Walter) in a bar, the womanizer's life is about to change. Evelyn, who has been repeatedly calling Dave on his show and requested the song 'Misty', soon turns out to be quite obsessive...Clint Eastwood is cool as always. Donna Mills and John Larch are also very good in their roles. The best performance, however, is delivered by Jessica Walter, who is truly great and believable in the role of the psychotic and obsessed Evelyn. The locations are beautiful and impressive, and the score is very cool. What disappointed me a little was the fact that it wasn't as suspenseful as I had expected. Also, Eastwood throws in some superfluous elements that just make the film less interesting. To some people these sequences may seem ingenious, but even though I like the music in the film, I personally don't want to watch a concert (that has nothing to do with the plot) for about 10 minutes in the middle of a movie. All things considered, Play Misty For Me is certainly worth watching, and Eastwood fans should definitely give it a try. It is just a little overrated, in my opinion, and as far as I am concerned, Eastwood has directed films that are much better, such as the cynical and brutal Western High Plains Drifter of 1973 (which was his next work as a director, and one of his greatest). Even though Play Misty For Me, is not one of my favorites from Eastwood, it is a decent film, however, and definitely recommended to his fans.

Gandolfini is very good in his role; emotional, vulnerable but still strong and convincing. I forgot one thing about Pitt & Roberts I just cannot put two of them together as a pair. Although we have here some universal messages about love, hit-man who's very emotional (strange for hit-man even though he's gay) and cameo role from great Gene Hackman; this is really movie that you can easily skip unless you're in love with Brad Pitt or you just want to watch a movie without innovative story.
