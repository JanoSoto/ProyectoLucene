But I might give this film the edge in terms of really being a Western masterpiece.I am updating my previous review to add information about the recent Blu Ray edition. Is it worth the upgrade. Yes. It's an excellent transfer.But I'll start with the two criticisms I have of this film...and they're minor. First, that in 1962, with 2 of America's greatest actors, John Ford still couldn't find the money to make the film in color. Second, that every once in a while in films, Jimmy Stewart could be guilty of overacting just a bit, and he does here a couple of times.Now, a lot of criticism has been leveled toward this film about the ages of Stewart and Wayne when they made this film, and particularly of Stewart. The problem is that at the beginning and ending of the film, Stewart is supposed to be in his 60's. For the body of the film, Stewart was supposed to be in his early 20s. Stewart was 54 when he made the film. Well, tough luck. I'd rather have Stewart in the role than any other actor I can think of.The story here is simple -- a Western bully terrorizes people, and the question is who will have the guts to stand up to him? And then, the question is who really did shoot Liberty Valence? But beyond the basic story, this film is rich in the little details race relations, the inability of most Westerners to read, lawlessness, not to mention sadism.The other highlight of this film is the acting. This is one of John Wayne's best performances, and here he even doesn't seem awkward in the love scenes. Wayne even looks like he's enjoying the film! Stewart, despite a little overacting in a few scenes is just right for the part of the lawyer.Vera Miles is perfect as the love interest for both Wayne and Stewart. Miles was an underrated actress, but I never failed to enjoy her in any film or television appearance.I never liked Lee Marvin. Not ever in even one film. But, he chews the scenery up here as Liberty Valence. It's a bravura performance, and possibly his best.Edmond O'Brien is another of the underrated character actors who shines here. I always liked O'Brien, even when he had a few starring roles. But I don't think I ever enjoyed him more than here as the drunken newspaper publisher. This should have been an Oscar winning supporting role.I never had much use for Andy Devine, but he's really quite charming here...in his own rough way. He's particularly interesting at the beginning and end of the film.Jeanette Nolan and John Qualen are two wonderful character actors who play husband and wife, and play Scandinavian owners of a restaurant. Woody Strode has an excellent role as Wayne's Negro worker. And we can't leave out the creepy Strother Martin.I rarely like Westerns nowadays, but this is an exception, John Ford at his peak.

If one does not like the incomprehensive, blundering, annoying and unimaginative drivel of Adam Sandler's inhuman man-child shtick, you would not like this movie. I never have, so it's safe to say, this was one excruciatingly painful movie to bear.That all said, I can see in a world that people flocked to see Twilight, follow Kardashians or actually would vote for Trump, there's something for everyone. Though, it would not be easy to block out the obnoxious and high-pitched annoying voice of Sandler, the movie itself is so formulaic, clichéd, obvious and felt long for even 89 minutes. Of course, that falls in the easy for people to like category since people tend to like sequels, remakes and films done hundreds of times before.I guess one can't really take anything serious here. Hell, Sandler didn't even look like he did since he was completely inconsistent with his own character&#x85;and I'm not talking about his predictable growth. Granted he was playing a spoiled young adult going on -2 who did anything he wanted at any second of the day, but he would jump out of character at odd times to play someone completely different throughout the film. Throw in a bunch of other dumb and uncreative characters, and you have a movie that solely relies on its audience liking the blabber of the nitwit on screen. Like that, and you'll probably forgive everything else. Don't and I just saved you 89 precious minutes you had no idea you'd want to spend doing something constructive.

A lot of people complain about this film, mostly the comic book fans and namely because Dredd removes his helmet and because it doesn't follow any of the comic book story lines. However, I thoroughly enjoy this film for many reasons. It's just entertaining, and overall well made in my opinion. Stallone fits the role of Dredd brilliantly, and Rob Schnieder is entertaining as Fergie along with Diane Lane as Judge Hershey. I have read that this film was originally supposed to have a darker tone than the one that ended up getting made which is a shame. I do feel sorry that Danny Cannon the director had creative differences with Stallone about this film. I can imagine dealing with an actor with that much star power can be intimidating and as much as I am a fan of Stallone I'm sure he can be very difficult to work with, at least I'm sure he was in the past.This film is a fun ride, and I never get tired of it. The special effects and sets are great for the times.You can tell there was a lot of attention to detail when they made this, and making it in the England where Judge Dredd was created was also cool since so many of these big films are made over in Hollywood.If you are looking for an entertaining action film with some comedy then check out Judge Dredd. Many people claim that the New Dredd film with Karl Urban is a better film since it is more closer in tone to the comics. Whilst it isn't a bad film, I found it quite boring and didn't buy Karl Urban as Judge Dredd at all, unlike Stallone who is clearly a tough guy and not just *acting* the part.Dredd is a good film. It was made at a time when the market wasn't saturated with super hero movies like it is today, and I think it has an originality to it along with nostalgia from seeing it when I was younger, and growing up with it very much like the Rocky movies.

I use to hate this movie not just because Michael Myers wasn't in it... but I thought it was boring. I was pretty young back then and the horror fan was quickly starting to develop in me. It's been years since I watched it, but when I was hanging out with my aunt and uncle I wanted to watch it just to see if I can get a new opinion out of it I was at least hoping that it would either by okay or good. But I was worried that it would suck hard like Halloween 5, 6, and Resurrection. I watched it and while I do have some problems, the film isn't as bad as everyone says it is. It's not the best in the franchise but I thought it was okay. Not great but okay. I think it probably deserves another watch if anyone watched it and hated it the first time. It's at least better than Halloween 5, 6, Resurrection and the Rob Zombie remakes. Good The acting is really good in the movie. All the actors did a good job with the material they were given.

Does this mean that Days of Thunder, following the travails of an up-and-comer racecar star (Cruise), is a really good movie? Well, in some ways yes, and in other ways not so much.I give the production this it moves fast and slick, and whenever cars are on the track it's visually compelling and exciting as the filmmakers know how to cut stuff together for Fast Impact (lest not forget the camera-work, filled with colors and smoke and cool contours, even a shot with Nicole Kidman standing at one point on the side of the frame is great to look at). And the casting here is fantastic; and forget Cruise, how about Robert Duvall (has he ever been anything less than solid, and here he's actually giving this conventional Trainer-cum-Mentor some soul), or Nicole Kidman (who gets really some of the best lines in the film), or Michael Rooker (by now something of an underrated character actor national treasure, and here imbuing an a-hole with a lot of sympathy and pathos)? Why not throw in John C. Reilly in there too, he has a couple of memorable moments too.Where it flails? Sadly, and I'm not sure if this is really on Towne's end - and one should note that Cruise has his only (?) writing credit here as co-story author - or the producers, but this all the same is light-weight stuff. There's not much conflict to the proceedings, or much that sticks to the gravel, no pun intended (OK, some). This is the kind of movie that gives people like Duvall some excellent scenes to at least try to overcome the clichés of the sports movie (and make no mistake, that's what this is deep down, and a programmer of the old-time-studio variety, not a terrible thing inherently)... and then you got Cary Elwes as Russ Wheeler. The last time one saw a motorist with the last name Wheeler was in a Disney Goofy cartoon about Motor Madness.

This is the kind of movie that gives people like Duvall some excellent scenes to at least try to overcome the clichés of the sports movie (and make no mistake, that's what this is deep down, and a programmer of the old-time-studio variety, not a terrible thing inherently)... and then you got Cary Elwes as Russ Wheeler.

Hawn didn't really know very much about the Army or the many regiments and training you have to go through to make it in the Army. While Bill Murray's Pvt. John Winger seems to know a lot about the Army protocols and the many ways he could outsmart and outwit his superiors. To me, his sardonic humour is played quite effectively and might be one of the reasons why this movie is really good. Back in 1981, Illinois native Bill Murray was pretty much in his third year gracing the silver screen with witty charm, cynical humour and manipulative tactics to outsmart practically anyone crossing his path. After donning his craft on sketch comedies like Saturday Night Live and the Canadian equivalent SCTV, Murray has churned up a string full of off-the-wall comedies like Meatballs, 'Caddieshack and Stripes' being his third one shows that his flair for slapstick comedy is just a natural thing for him. Why spoil a good thing? Right?The opening scenes features Winger who after a few hours loses his job as a cab driver, his girlfriend dumps him and a basketball ricochets through his window. Feeling like there's nowhere to turn to, he enlists in the Army. He also tries to persuade his brilliant friend Russell Ziskey (Harold Ramis) who's an English teacher to foreign students. The duo collaborates and writes their own set of Army protocols much to the chagrin of the hard-nosed Sgt. Hulka (Warren Oates who hasn't acted in while due to poor health). Murray seems to be permanently liberal in points of view towards the people surrounding him, both superior and inferior to him. He's not afraid to speak his mind out about you, even if it's not very flattering. When Hulka get shot, Winger arbitrarily steps up to the plate and commands the other recruits and these are where the funny bits of the movie comes to effect. Unfortunately, like Private Benjamin, Stripes gets lost out of focus near the middle of the film. In Private Benjamin, the film lost its charm once the feminist message comes across while they were in Europe. In Stripes the film gets bogged down one he goes on a mission in Europe. If they would've stuck to the slapstick elements it was intended for, the movie would've been much better. Winger's initiative was to operate on the very first mechanized armoured vehicle, before it gets underway, Winger and Ziskey hijack the RV and goes behind the Iron Curtain and they become lustful towards two female MP's (Sean Young and P.J. Soles). If the focus was on these four characters, it would have worked out in the long run. Instead it concentrates on the ridiculous mud wrestling scenes and the RV hijacking. The final product becomes deplorably infantile and takes away the intrigue that both Murray and Ramis carry throughout the film as likable obnoxious characters. I liked it when Pvt. Winger verbally lashes down at the recruits and belittles their background upbringings.The late John Candy a long-time alum from SCTV fame comes here on his own as Pvt.

And I found it updated which is not very strange since we are talking about a film made in the early fifties. There is not much suspense in the plot mostly because as the story goes by, it is very obvious who the murderer is. The definition of suspense is that the spectator should be guessing who the guilty person is, or even better guessing who the bad guy is. In this film, we do know who the bad guy is, but we don't know if he really did it or not. Real suspense would have been that the guy that everyone thought that did it, in fact didn't did it at all, and that the one that looks innocent had done it. Now that would've been a twist! There are a couple of other things that killed the suspense in me. Why a man that is a photographer and tries to convince a policeman that his neighbor killed his wife and has no evidence and is looking through the window with a telephoto camera, doesn't take pictures of the scene of crime and use them as evidence. And how come that a man that is going to murder his wife and cut her in small pieces doesn't draw down the window blinds so no one can see what he is doing and testify against him. But I have to admit, Hitchcock gets away with it anyway, because he makes you see things that only a great director like him can. He will make you believe that Jeff and Lisa are right and everyone else is wrong just by watching this couple's attitude, created through their acting. And there is the strength of these actors; they are extremely reassuring in their personalities that as such, it impregnates the whole film. Just by the way they pose and sit and look you can almost smell that whatever they do is right. On the contrary, Thorwald hasn't a chance because from the very first scene he is doomed; he is the bad guy even before the film has started!

I love the movie because it is honest about the flaws of both cultures; the Japanese collectivist society above the individual and the American individualism who cares how it effects anyone else. Each one learns from the other. Each sheds a bit of his indigenous culture. My favorite scene is when Masa explains to Nick that he shames himself and his group by stealing. The way he does it is very gentle and understanding. Yet, Nick teaches Mas to stand up for himself against the suits and go it alone when there is no other choice. Ridley always has great depth in his movies. Charlie's murder pushes Nick over the edge and there is no coming back. The movie was made when the Japanese economy was really booming and there was great anxiety in America that they were going to buy us out. The hostility is realistically depicted coming both directions. The only scene I disliked was the Hiroshima lecture which forgot to mention that tiny historical fact of Pearl Harbor; they attacked us first. We could talk about the 200 men that took days to suffocate trapped in the bottom of the Arizona in Pearl Harbor. That scene, the lecture about Hiroshima, was undoubtedly the price paid for the Japenese locations and actors participation. It reminded me of that awful revisionist Midway where we have Japanese Naval Officers weeping over shooting our pilots down, please. The movie works well as a straight crime drama. There is a counterfeit ring going on being run by a Japanese nationalist who wants to bankrupt our country. I know, young people, it sounds so silly now, back then the Japanese were buying up tons of our stuff every day there was this great anxiety in the country. Garcia gets killed early; he is the comic relief and once he goes the film darkens. Capshaw is gorgeous to look at, unfortunately if you saw Indy and The Temple Of Doom, you already know she cannot act one scene. The movie changes from just a crime drama into more of a revenge picture after Sato murders Charlie right in front of Nick who is trapped behind a chain link fence. I love the movie because on the whole it has real depth of studying two antithetical cultures and modeling a great piece of wisdom.Nick and Masahiro each take something from the other. Each emerges a stronger, wiser individual by being together and absorbing the other's culture. Believe me, a film that teaches people that each culture has elements that are good and bad. The wise individual sheds his religious devotion to his indigenous culture, which always contains negative elements, and takes the cultural treasure from each culture he meets. I love the above scene that highlights the beauty of Japanese culture but I also love when Nick snaps at Mas and says,And yes, if one of you guys had an original idea, you couldn't pull it out of you tight A's. This is the balance of the movie, except for the Hiroshima lecture, there is a fair equilibrium of both cultures looking, unabashedly, at each other. The movie opens to a great song that contains Conklin's being I'll be holding on. A ruthless individualist on the take cop who is tough, cold and mean. By the end of the movie, watch for the existential changes in both men. Mas goes it alone with Conklin, risking everything to bring Sato into custody. Nick's lone wolf individualism rubs off on Mas. Nick returns the counterfeit plates to Mas in a funny way but the point is made. Nick teases Mas into thinking he is going to make off with them and sell them for money. Look at the relief on Mas' face when they are under a goodbye shirt. A great little movie. Not Ridley's Best But Not Prometheus Either.

I love the movie because it is honest about the flaws of both cultures; the Japanese collectivist society above the individual and the American individualism who cares how it effects anyone else. Each one learns from the other. Each sheds a bit of his indigenous culture. My favorite scene is when Masa explains to Nick that he shames himself and his group by stealing. The way he does it is very gentle and understanding. Yet, Nick teaches Mas to stand up for himself against the suits and go it alone when there is no other choice. Ridley always has great depth in his movies. Charlie's murder pushes Nick over the edge and there is no coming back. The movie was made when the Japanese economy was really booming and there was great anxiety in America that they were going to buy us out. The hostility is realistically depicted coming both directions. The only scene I disliked was the Hiroshima lecture which forgot to mention that tiny historical fact of Pearl Harbor; they attacked us first. We could talk about the 200 men that took days to suffocate trapped in the bottom of the Arizona in Pearl Harbor. That scene, the lecture about Hiroshima, was undoubtedly the price paid for the Japenese locations and actors participation. It reminded me of that awful revisionist Midway where we have Japanese Naval Officers weeping over shooting our pilots down, please. The movie works well as a straight crime drama. There is a counterfeit ring going on being run by a Japanese nationalist who wants to bankrupt our country. I know, young people, it sounds so silly now, back then the Japanese were buying up tons of our stuff every day there was this great anxiety in the country. Garcia gets killed early; he is the comic relief and once he goes the film darkens. Capshaw is gorgeous to look at, unfortunately if you saw Indy and The Temple Of Doom, you already know she cannot act one scene.

Things start to get out of control for the show, when Truman starts finding out about the reality of his life.Jim Carrey was just perfect in his role, definitely one of his top movies, a shame he didn't end up winning an Oscar for this movie. Apart from that, i found it very interesting how other actors interacted around Truman, it feels as he should have got the hints of his life being a TV show much sooner, but of course it is just a movie.I think that the movie could have been longer and more detailed, it was just an awesome film, but more plot could have made it way better. It's sad that they didn't show Truman after he left the show, but it guess that wasn't possible because they couldn't film him anymore, because he was off the set. I loved the idea, they wanted to create a perfect life for a person, where they don't get to get in trouble and can just live peacefully, if it wasn't for Sylvia, Truman probably wouldn't have escaped the set ever. It almost made me believe by his last line, that Truman knew all along, that it was a show and he is the star of it, or did he know? That's a question i haven't seen explained anywhere.Nonetheless, a great watch, perfect idea, maybe it had some flaws, like almost all the movies do, but still - something different and interesting, that makes you think.
