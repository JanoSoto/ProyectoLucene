[{"date":"27 December 2007","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" I really enjoyed 'You've Got Mail'. I am a very big fan of the Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan pair. It's quite a good romantic\/comedic duo. And just the other day I came across a movie titled 'In The Good Old Summertime' playing on TurnerClassicMovies. I sat down and proceeded to watch this seemingly interesting movie. And it was very interesting.The movie follows the story of Van Johnson's character, Andrew 'Andy' Larkin, and Judy Garland's character, Veronica Fisher. Unbeknownst to the two after a run-in on the street, they are secret pen pal lovers. Neither knows of the other's identity, and when Veronica comes to work at Andy's place of business, all havoc breaks loose. At first, Andy and Veronica hate each other, but when they two pen pals decide to meet for a date, Andy gets his friend to peek through the window to scope out his soon-to-be bride-to-be. It happens almost exactly like the scene with Dave Chappelle and Tom Hanks in 'You've Got Mail. But when his friend relays that his date is in fact Miss Fisher, Andy is floored, yet slightly intrigued. He then proceeds to have some fun, and walks into the café. The scene in 'You've Got Mail' where the guy asks if he can take the chair happens the same way it does in the '49 movie. And when Andy is asked to leave Veronica's table, he does what Tom Hanks does and sits in the chair next to hers at the next table over. It's funny how the new mirrors the old. Minus the musical part. After her pen pal lover stands Veronica up, she remains 'sick' the next day. Andy goes to check on her and realizes that he is in love with her. It happens rather similarly to the scene in 'You've Got Mail'.It's a really quirky movie that inspires lots of laughs. Really, I recommend it.

Christmas Vacation is a film that deals with many a Christmas issues and binds them all together in a reasonably satisfying way even if it feels heavy handed and somewhat juvenile at certain times.At its core, Christmas Vacation is a film that challenges the American idea, or perhaps the Western idea, of what Christmas is. There is nothing religious in this film and if there is any mention of Jesus Christ, the real reason there is a Christmas, then I must've missed it. Clark Griswold (Chase) is an American who has a family; a well paid job and a 'prefect' detached suburban house with a picket fence and a people carrier. For him and his family (who are a little less than perfect) Christmas is everything he is expected (as the man of the house who puts the turkey on the table) to risk life and limb in order to staple lights to the roof; he is expected to be able to host a huge Christmas day and he is expected to out class the neighbours when it comes to front yard decorations amongst other things.Bizarrely enough, the funniest parts of Christmas Vacation come in the form of its scenes involving animals. When the cat chews the lights under the chair and gets a shock, I laughed likewise when a squirrel gets loose in the house, the initial sighting of the animal is when the joke's at its funniest but this seems to be a concept that had worn thin by the time Schwarzenegger was chased by a Reindeer around his neighbour's house in Jingle All the Way. Christmas Vacation as a film tests that theory that family is the most important thing at Christmas because, when you pick the film apart, the over crowded house full of finicky family members at Christmas is the films overall pitch. Take away the rest of the family and the nasty hillbilly stereotypes that turn up in the form of Eddie (Quaid) and you don't have a film, you have a 'How to have a perfect Western Christmas' demonstration. It's also a shame that pure idiocy spawns most of Christmas Vacation's jokes. Clark sees fit to staple the lights to his house (how will he get them off afterwards?) in an attempt to go to extremes for his family and a mere week long holiday but doesn't take due care and attention. He also attempts to light up the lights in a big unveiling to the whole family but idiotically, doesn't check them beforehand. Again, Clark is willing to go to such a length that he doesn't even want to spoil the surprise of the lights for himself so that he can share the first experience with his entire household. Either that or he's a complete idiot for not checking the plugs.Christmas Vacation isn't pure farce but it isn't too far off. This is one of the film's plus points in the sense it remains sober in its attempt to portray humour which is clearly aimed at children for 80% of the time. Charlie Chaplin in The Gold Rush was in a home of some sort with snow and cold on the outside trying to survive the whole ordeal with two others; Clark is this in a sense. But the similarities continue in the sense of slapstick with Chritsmas Vacation containing some iffy humour in the form of flatulence and downright stupidity which are embedded into this film whereas The Gold Rush used slapstick and genuinely funny situations; probably due to the fact it wasn't aimed at children Christmas Vacation smashed neighbour's windows; Clark kicks his model reindeer's away as he lashes out at what suburban society demands you have on your lawn; there is a lot of running around once a squirrel gets loose and an insane event which acts as reason to get a SWAT team around. These incidences may humour and entertain children but for the rest of us come on, are we really finding this funny? The only thing I could really tag onto and smirk at throughout is the way Chevy Chase portrays Clark. His deadpan and downer performance of a man seemingly on the edge of not only his family but his work and his Westernised holiday is a good example of a performance carrying a film. For everyone else, Ellen (D'Angelo) is the submissive of sorts wife; the children are not developed beyond anything they need to be and the rest of the family fill in the blanks with good grounds for argument that there are too many of them. Eddie Johnson's character, like I said, and his family are really bad examples of exploiting a certain race\/class\/gender\/sexuality (delete as appropriate) in a negative and demeaning light; something I'd expect a Disney film to do subconsciously.But then again, the film is cheery and fun in a way. It starts off in a way that is akin to a 'Naked Gun' film and I liked two out of those three films and despite loosing ground on quality at various stages, Christmas Vacation deals with deeper subject matter such as trying to host the perfect American family Christmas and how far one should go to achieve these things. The humour may be lagging behind its pacing and variation of jokes but the film has a charm that, let's face it; is only there thanks to Chase's portrayal of the 'man stuck in a no win situation' character; much like Keaton and much like Chaplin.

Mrs Doubtfire was a film I used to love as a kid- I first remembered that as soon as it came out on video, I snapped it up quick. I used to watch it over and over because I couldn't get enough of it, but as I got older, I watched Mrs Doubtfire for the first time in my 20s a few years back, and afterwards, I could never get my head around the hype of this movie, as I realised how unrealistic this portrayal of divorcée parents was. Miranda- played by a somewhat mis casted Sally Field- decides to divorce husband Daniel (Robin Williams), after enduring years of his mis haps and childish shenanigans, especially when she arrives home to a group of screaming kids messing up the house and discovering that Daniel has thrown a birthday party for his son, which descends into chaos.Daniel is devastated-, although he is just as devastated when he is told by the court that he can only have the kids once a week, which prompts him to turn to his gay brother and boyfriend for support. With latex, a cheap wig, a dress and a pair of stockings, he later becomes Mrs Doubtfire- a Scottish nanny, of whom Miranda hires to look after the children, whilst she goes off to work. Miranda gets a new boyfriend named Stuart, played by Pierce Brosnan and here he comes across as a somewhat slimy, two-faced piece of work. But he only gets a few lines and as Stuart, character-wise he was so pedestrian and almost one-dimensional.Mrs Doubtfire is a comical farce- but whilst Robin Williams efforts as Mrs Doubtfire are at times funny, I thought the circumstances that led to the couple's break up was, for a comedy, just ridiculous. Plus, the conclusion was rather out of sync and so far removed from reality. I understand that with divorce cases especially when kids are involved, there is hardly a happy ending. And whilst the last scenes did imply that there was some hope for Miranda and Daniel, the truth is they are no longer together as a couple and are no longer in love with one another. The ending was neither here or there-although it was realistic enough to be believed. In fact, the ending was much more believable than the other aspects of the film itself.The cast were at best okay I've seen Robin Williams act better and do better than in this movie, I thought Sally as Miranda was too stuck-up and as I said earlier, she was mis-casted as that character.And by the way, Mrs Doubtfire was indeed Scottish, not English as the writers of the film have pointed out.Having said that, the gag's and jokes, whilst they were enjoyable for a few times, eventually became tedious and tiresome. The sentimentality of it became nauseating and the cutesy factor was short-lived. The younger ones will love it more, i'm sure but for a so-called family film dealing with the complicated issue of divorce, Mrs Doubtfire was at most sappy and saccharine sweet.Mrs Doubtfire is not Tootsie- it is nowhere as good as Tootsie; yes this film can be funny on occasions but in all, it just doesn't cut it. It is just a tad too long, too predictable and with some scenes, you often have to wait for some time for something really interesting to happen within the film.In all though, this is a rather bog-standard affair, with nothing remotely new to offer to the audience. It is a film about a guy who dresses up as a woman, in order for him to see his children. With Tootsie, it's about a guy- who like Daniel is an actor- who dresses up as a woman in order for him to secure a part in a daytime soap opera. That movie is far more substantial and interesting; some would say it is also funnier than Mrs Doubtfire, which is in truth more of a melodrama, rather than a comedy-based film.Mrs Doubtfire is at best very average, but it is way overrated and compared to Some Like It Hot and Tootsie, it trails behind by a couple of metres. It is a rehash of the cross-dressing elements of those films juxtaposed onto a family friendly context, but it is done in a not so successful and efficient way.This is really a poor man's Tootsie, and whilst it can be funny at times, it does come across as being banal and predictable for a movie that Mrs Doubtfire is.

Plus, the conclusion was rather out of sync and so far removed from reality. I understand that with divorce cases especially when kids are involved, there is hardly a happy ending. And whilst the last scenes did imply that there was some hope for Miranda and Daniel, the truth is they are no longer together as a couple and are no longer in love with one another. The ending was neither here or there-although it was realistic enough to be believed. In fact, the ending was much more believable than the other aspects of the film itself.The cast were at best okay I've seen Robin Williams act better and do better than in this movie, I thought Sally as Miranda was too stuck-up and as I said earlier, she was mis-casted as that character.And by the way, Mrs Doubtfire was indeed Scottish, not English as the writers of the film have pointed out.Having said that, the gag's and jokes, whilst they were enjoyable for a few times, eventually became tedious and tiresome. The sentimentality of it became nauseating and the cutesy factor was short-lived. The younger ones will love it more, i'm sure but for a so-called family film dealing with the complicated issue of divorce, Mrs Doubtfire was at most sappy and saccharine sweet.Mrs Doubtfire is not Tootsie- it is nowhere as good as Tootsie; yes this film can be funny on occasions but in all, it just doesn't cut it. It is just a tad too long, too predictable and with some scenes, you often have to wait for some time for something really interesting to happen within the film.In all though, this is a rather bog-standard affair, with nothing remotely new to offer to the audience. It is a film about a guy who dresses up as a woman, in order for him to see his children. With Tootsie, it's about a guy- who like Daniel is an actor- who dresses up as a woman in order for him to secure a part in a daytime soap opera. That movie is far more substantial and interesting; some would say it is also funnier than Mrs Doubtfire, which is in truth more of a melodrama, rather than a comedy-based film.Mrs Doubtfire is at best very average, but it is way overrated and compared to Some Like It Hot and Tootsie, it trails behind by a couple of metres. It is a rehash of the cross-dressing elements of those films juxtaposed onto a family friendly context, but it is done in a not so successful and efficient way.This is really a poor man's Tootsie, and whilst it can be funny at times, it does come across as being banal and predictable for a movie that Mrs Doubtfire is.

In an age where CGI rules nearly every movie, and pop culture references are to be scattered within every scene in order to create a bit of a norm with the audience, this film does the exact opposite, by creating no silly dialog based off of some other film, or referencing some famous TV show or popular song, this is what fantasy should be today, but sadly, is falling apart with every new Shrek and Hoodwinked out on the market.The scenes that give off the most powerful emotional responses to me are the ones when the world tends to look chaotic, destroyed and nearly moments away from their destruction. The creatures in the film, such as the Rock Biter and Falkor are the greatest examples of why making creatures for movies with good old fashioned foam rubber and some animatronics instead of CGI really go a long way. The magic Atreyu experiences with his interaction with these two creatures is a lot better than watching the child actor trying to imagine the creature in front of him. Working with CG, people's eyes wander because they cannot see the creature, with the characters in this movie acting with puppets, there's more response and emotion than trying to act with something that's not there.The last few minutes are the most emotional to me. The Princess is simply a cute little girl who knows what the problem is, but it's a bit different than just saying it.Yes, the acting on Bastian's part is a bit bad, and the ending is a bit weak, and the editing is pretty poor, compared to other movies, but you know what? I loved this movie. I didn't know what was going to happen next. I had tears in my eyes during the swamp of despair, I got emotional when the princess yelled for Bastion and I had little tears for the ending theme.People probably look at this movie as outdated, I think it's fresher than anything out to date. From the beginning song by Limahl (Check for Kajagoogoo from the 80's) to the ending with Bastion yelling Yeah!, it's an absolute treat.Give Shrek a break, grab this movie instead.

We have a playboy, David Larrabee (Greg Kinnear) and his much older brother Linus Larrabee (Harrison Ford).

Linus takes advantage of that. His plan is to seduce her, convince her to come with him to various places, come to Paris with him and leave her there.

The dramatic, mysterious circumstances surrounding the real Karen Silkwood's life and death led me to think that the movie would be suspenseful and closely plotted, focused mainly on the subject of unsafe working conditions at a plutonium-processing facility. Instead, it's more of a character-based movie, a chance for Meryl Streep to create a detailed portrait of a working-class Oklahoma woman.Of course it's always a pleasure to watch Streep dig deeply into a character. She subverts our initial impression that Karen is just a rowdy good-time girl, playing her as a woman who throws herself into union and workplace-safety concerns because she is losing everything else in her life. She also has good scenes with Kurt Russell (as her boyfriend) and Cher (as her lesbian housemate).But ultimately, I think that Nichols loves his leading lady a little too much. He lights and shoots Streep to look almost too movie-star pretty in many scenes (despite her awful shag haircut), and her voice is almost too good when she sings Amazing Grace. Several scenes could be trimmed or cut entirely, and Karen's character arc would still be in place. For instance, the first 30 minutes of the movie spend way too long dealing with Karen's relationship with her three children, who are now in the custody of her ex-husband, but never appear in the movie after that.Because Nichols is never sure whether to focus more attention on Karen's relationships or on her job, and is unwilling to even try to explain the confused circumstances behind Karen Silkwood's death, Silkwood, while a good showcase for Streep, does not fully work as a film.

Attractive waitress Slim (presumably a nickname, although we never find out what her real name is) meets the handsome, wealthy Mitch and romance blossoms. They marry, move into a big house and have a kid. Then the tone abruptly changes. Slim discovers that Mitch is cheating on her. When she complains, he turns violent and abusive, and she tries to leave him. Eventually she manages to escape and moves with her young daughter to another part of the country where she lives under a false name. Mitch, however, is not willing to let her go and uses his financial resources to track her down.Sounds familiar? The basic plot is derived from another thriller from about a decade earlier, Sleeping with the Enemy. In that film Julia Roberts played the abused wife of a wealthy, successful man who managed to escape and move to another part of the country where she lived under a false name. In that film too her husband was not willing to let her go and used his financial resources to track her down.The plot of Sleeping with the Enemy might seem like the sort of thing one would associate with an issue of the month TV movie about spousal violence. What raises that film above the level of the commonplace is the way the theme is handled. Enough, by contrast, fails to rise above the level of the commonplace; indeed, it frequently falls below it. The film-makers have evidently ignored the first rule of successful plagiarism make sure that your film is better than, or at least as good as, the one it is modelled on.There are a number of reasons for this. The first is that, frankly, J-Lo is no J-Ro. Roberts' performance in Sleeping with the Enemy is one of her best, showing her character Laura as beautiful but vulnerable and passive in the early scenes and maturing in the later ones into a strong, confident woman, unafraid to take control of her life. Jennifer Lopez had given a sensitive and well-judged performance in her previous film, Angel Eyes, but in Enough she is much weaker. She is at times so softly spoken as to be almost inaudible (a problem I have noticed in other films of hers) and brings very little emotional depth to her character. Patrick Bergin was much better as Laura's husband Martin, a creepily obsessive control freak, than is the forgettable Billy Williams as Mitch.There are one or two differences between the plots of the two films. Laura had no children and faked her own death, something Slim does not do. The most important difference comes in the final scenes. Slim was herself an illegitimate child and has long been estranged from her wealthy father Jupiter, played by Fred Ward as an over-the-top caricature of the arrogant, heartless rich man. (It is unclear whether Jupiter is a nickname or a genuine Christian name, but it seems appropriate enough, as he clearly thinks of himself as King of the gods). Eventually, however, she manages to win him round, and he promises to help her. This help takes the form of paying for her to have tuition in the martial arts, following which she tracks Mitch down to take revenge on him. In Sleeping with the Enemy Laura had no thoughts of revenge- she only wanted to escape from Martin- but even this twist is not an original one. There is a very similar plot development in Double Jeopardy, another thriller about a woman seeking bloody revenge on the husband who has wronged her.The film was advertised under the tag line Self defence isn't murder. This is an accurate statement of the law, but what Slim sets out to do at the end of the film would not come within the legal definition of self defence; one may only kill in self-defence if one is in immediate mortal danger from the person killed. (Double Jeopardy took a similarly cavalier attitude to legal issues). Slim intends first to humiliate Mitch and then to kill him in cold blood for the sake of revenge, something which would leave herself open to a murder charge. It is never convincingly explained why Slim does not, much earlier in the action, complain to the police about Mitch or consult a lawyer about obtaining an injunction against him. The answer, presumably, is that if she had done either of those things there wouldn't have been a film.I was disappointed to see that the film was directed by Michael Apted, as in the past he has been responsible for films as good as Nell or Gorillas in the Mist. Certainly, much of his output has consisted of routine thrillers like Gorky Park or Extreme Measures, but at least those films were competently made and, on their own level, enjoyable. Enough, a badly-written, badly-acted celebration of vindictive violence, lacks even their basic competence. 3\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"27 December 2007","score":"2 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" The opening scenes of Enough seem more like a romantic comedy than a thriller.

Attractive waitress Slim (presumably a nickname, although we never find out what her real name is) meets the handsome, wealthy Mitch and romance blossoms. They marry, move into a big house and have a kid. Then the tone abruptly changes. Slim discovers that Mitch is cheating on her. When she complains, he turns violent and abusive, and she tries to leave him. Eventually she manages to escape and moves with her young daughter to another part of the country where she lives under a false name. Mitch, however, is not willing to let her go and uses his financial resources to track her down.Sounds familiar? The basic plot is derived from another thriller from about a decade earlier, Sleeping with the Enemy. In that film Julia Roberts played the abused wife of a wealthy, successful man who managed to escape and move to another part of the country where she lived under a false name. In that film too her husband was not willing to let her go and used his financial resources to track her down.The plot of Sleeping with the Enemy might seem like the sort of thing one would associate with an issue of the month TV movie about spousal violence. What raises that film above the level of the commonplace is the way the theme is handled. Enough, by contrast, fails to rise above the level of the commonplace; indeed, it frequently falls below it. The film-makers have evidently ignored the first rule of successful plagiarism make sure that your film is better than, or at least as good as, the one it is modelled on.There are a number of reasons for this. The first is that, frankly, J-Lo is no J-Ro. Roberts' performance in Sleeping with the Enemy is one of her best, showing her character Laura as beautiful but vulnerable and passive in the early scenes and maturing in the later ones into a strong, confident woman, unafraid to take control of her life. Jennifer Lopez had given a sensitive and well-judged performance in her previous film, Angel Eyes, but in Enough she is much weaker. She is at times so softly spoken as to be almost inaudible (a problem I have noticed in other films of hers) and brings very little emotional depth to her character. Patrick Bergin was much better as Laura's husband Martin, a creepily obsessive control freak, than is the forgettable Billy Williams as Mitch.There are one or two differences between the plots of the two films. Laura had no children and faked her own death, something Slim does not do. The most important difference comes in the final scenes. Slim was herself an illegitimate child and has long been estranged from her wealthy father Jupiter, played by Fred Ward as an over-the-top caricature of the arrogant, heartless rich man. (It is unclear whether Jupiter is a nickname or a genuine Christian name, but it seems appropriate enough, as he clearly thinks of himself as King of the gods). Eventually, however, she manages to win him round, and he promises to help her. This help takes the form of paying for her to have tuition in the martial arts, following which she tracks Mitch down to take revenge on him. In Sleeping with the Enemy Laura had no thoughts of revenge- she only wanted to escape from Martin- but even this twist is not an original one. There is a very similar plot development in Double Jeopardy, another thriller about a woman seeking bloody revenge on the husband who has wronged her.The film was advertised under the tag line Self defence isn't murder. This is an accurate statement of the law, but what Slim sets out to do at the end of the film would not come within the legal definition of self defence; one may only kill in self-defence if one is in immediate mortal danger from the person killed. (Double Jeopardy took a similarly cavalier attitude to legal issues). Slim intends first to humiliate Mitch and then to kill him in cold blood for the sake of revenge, something which would leave herself open to a murder charge. It is never convincingly explained why Slim does not, much earlier in the action, complain to the police about Mitch or consult a lawyer about obtaining an injunction against him. The answer, presumably, is that if she had done either of those things there wouldn't have been a film.I was disappointed to see that the film was directed by Michael Apted, as in the past he has been responsible for films as good as Nell or Gorillas in the Mist. Certainly, much of his output has consisted of routine thrillers like Gorky Park or Extreme Measures, but at least those films were competently made and, on their own level, enjoyable. Enough, a badly-written, badly-acted celebration of vindictive violence, lacks even their basic competence. 3\/10 ","genre":"Crime, Drama, Thriller"},{"date":"27 December 2007","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Johnny Depp is hilarious as always, and Martin Landau also manages to portray a well-rounded character once all is said and done.Two things I particularly liked about this movie 1) Ed Wood's entreprenurial spirit.

This could adequetlly sum all of David Lynch's films. His films are often filled with symbolism and it is easy to finish one of his films and have no real idea of what actually happened. They usually take two or three viewings, and a little research to get a good idea what the movie is actually trying to convey. Blue Velvet has a simpler plot that can generally be understood at a basic level upon first viewing, but there is plenty of symbolism and deeper meaning to make it enjoyable for further viewings. I put enjoyable in quotation marks because to many watching it is not an enjoyable experience. It is a movie deep seated in horror and mandess, with scenes that make you crawl under the covers and lock the doors. I recommend this, but I warn you first. Cinemphiles I'm guessing will jump to this film immediately....The film starts with an idyllic, picturesque small town were everyone seems to know everyone. It's a town where every day there are blue skies, manicured lawns, pretty flowers, and quiet simple, friendly people. Lynch fills the screen with gorgeous pictures reminiscent of fifties television shows. But this is a David Lynch movie and the pretty pictures don't last long. They are just there to lure us into a false sense of hope, happiness and security. The false happiness is silenced completely when a man watering his lawn all of a sudden drops to the ground after what appears to be a heart attack. This is followed by the camera, which pans down past the convulsing man and deep into the grass. Digging into the earth until the camera is dark with freshly wet dirt and grotesque bugs. The idyllic town is only pretty on the surface. Underneath the top layer of goodness lies a darker, seedier town hidden from the eyes of most of its citizens.The plot of the film revolves around Kyle MacLachlan and Laura Dern delving deeper and deeper into the darker side of the small town. MacLachlan finds a dismembered ear on his walk home from the hospital one afternoon. Finding such a macabre in his hometown sparks a quest to discover who's head the ear could belong to and why it was removed. He involves the good girl Laura Dern in his quest and they sink into darker waters. To tell more of the plot is to give away too much. I'll just say that it is not for the weak of heart.Dennis Hopper plays one of cinemas creepiest villains to date. His psychosis is even more terrifying in that it is so real. Here is no Freddy Krueger, or even a Hannibal Lector. This is not some crazed psychopath lurking in the corner. Sure he is psychotic, and maniacal, but versions of him can be found almost nightly in any major city newspaper. He is not a homicidal maniac, but a violent, evil man made even more so by his addiction to unnamed drugs.Isabella Rossellini plays Dorothy Valens with such beauty and sadness it breaks your heart as it squirms your stomach. Her character has taken such horrible abuse over her life she has come to like and enjoy it. Mixed with heavy amounts masochism her performance is remarkable.I have watched this with my friends, and two of them could not finish it, being repulsed and disturbed by the content and the overall madness.

","genre":"Horror, Mystery"},{"date":"27 December 2007","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" In what can only be described as one of the most notorious and audacious major films ever to be produced, the very short reign of one of Rome's most infamous rulers is depicted. McDowell plays the title figure, a young man whose family has mostly died or been killed off and who inherits the title of Emperor of Rome when his grandfather O'Toole passes on. Already involved in an incestuous relationship with his sister Savoy, he searches for a mate and happily settles on the most promiscuous woman in all of Rome Mirren. Once firmly entrenched in the scheme of power, he begins ridding himself of all enemies and perceived enemies and torments, or has killed, anyone who doesn't suit him. As his horror show escalates, the few remaining statesmen of Rome consider whether assassination might be the answer. That's the story in a nutshell though it takes this movie two and a half hours to tell it and it tells it rather disjointedly thanks to some careless editing by the producer (director Brass was shut out of the final editing.) McDowell is fairly enthralling in his role and seemingly willing to do everything from frolicking half-nude (and at least one time completely) to urinating on camera to raping a virgin to fisting a young man, though he did refuse to film a man-on-man rape scene (something he would later portray, in a fashion, in 1993's I'll Sleep When I Die. What? It was more acceptable to appear to cram his hand inside a man rather than his penis?!?) Because of the sensationalistic nature of the film, he sometimes overdoes it, occasionally getting close to having his own personal Mommie Dearest, but generally he turns in a strong performance. Mirren, who doesn't appear until well into the film, is interesting to watch, though she really doesn't have many lines. Savoy is here for her body and, on that level, she delivers. Her acting is adequate at best. O'Toole, done up in a fright wig and syphilitic makeup, gives his scenes some weight, but it's jarring to see him playing in a pool with several naked young men and women (his little fishies.) Gielgud appears briefly as one of his confidantes and escapes from the film before his reputation can be too badly tarnished. Steiner, head shaved and gaunt, is decent as one of McDowell's advisors. Placido, a very attractive young man, has the unfortunate distinction of being the frequent object of McDowell's wrath, simply because he is in love with the lovely D'Angelo. Several centerfold models appear, frequently naked, as featured extras. It's all played out amid some spectacular sets and vivid costumes in an attempt to appear Fellini-esquire. What was intended to be a deeply dramatic spectacle, penned by Gore Vidal, is instead a lavish, but garish, parade of blood, skin, depravity, perversity and pornography, since the final cut (complete with added XXX scenes) was engineered by Penthouse publisher and the film's producer Guccione. That is not to say that the film isn't eye-poppingly captivating in a can't look away, shock value sort of manner. Several scenes occur which are practically unforgettable. Unfortunately, the way it was put together, it winds up as a series of vignettes, reveling in squalor, but with no strong narrative drive to make the journey worthwhile. Some truly splendid music, cribbed from classical composers, makes the imagery seem better than it is at times. The film, massively successful despite limited release due to obscenity laws and internal squabbling among its creators, remains one of the very few films to blend major movie stars and pornography, though the mainstream actors limit their participation to some nude scenes and implied sex. Sadly, the viewer knows little more about the Emperor in question when the film is over than when it began because someone forgot to flesh out the story while they were unveiling all the flesh. Though it's worth viewing just for the sheer jaw-dropping content, it is not for the squeamish. Gorings, impalings and other torments abound and every other frame features frontal nudity or kinky, graphic sex. ","genre":null},{"date":"27 December 2007","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" In what can only be described as one of the most notorious and audacious major films ever to be produced, the very short reign of one of Rome's most infamous rulers is depicted. McDowell plays the title figure, a young man whose family has mostly died or been killed off and who inherits the title of Emperor of Rome when his grandfather O'Toole passes on. Already involved in an incestuous relationship with his sister Savoy, he searches for a mate and happily settles on the most promiscuous woman in all of Rome Mirren. Once firmly entrenched in the scheme of power, he begins ridding himself of all enemies and perceived enemies and torments, or has killed, anyone who doesn't suit him. As his horror show escalates, the few remaining statesmen of Rome consider whether assassination might be the answer. That's the story in a nutshell though it takes this movie two and a half hours to tell it and it tells it rather disjointedly thanks to some careless editing by the producer (director Brass was shut out of the final editing.) McDowell is fairly enthralling in his role and seemingly willing to do everything from frolicking half-nude (and at least one time completely) to urinating on camera to raping a virgin to fisting a young man, though he did refuse to film a man-on-man rape scene (something he would later portray, in a fashion, in 1993's I'll Sleep When I Die. What? It was more acceptable to appear to cram his hand inside a man rather than his penis?!?) Because of the sensationalistic nature of the film, he sometimes overdoes it, occasionally getting close to having his own personal Mommie Dearest, but generally he turns in a strong performance. Mirren, who doesn't appear until well into the film, is interesting to watch, though she really doesn't have many lines. Savoy is here for her body and, on that level, she delivers. Her acting is adequate at best. O'Toole, done up in a fright wig and syphilitic makeup, gives his scenes some weight, but it's jarring to see him playing in a pool with several naked young men and women (his little fishies.) Gielgud appears briefly as one of his confidantes and escapes from the film before his reputation can be too badly tarnished. Steiner, head shaved and gaunt, is decent as one of McDowell's advisors. Placido, a very attractive young man, has the unfortunate distinction of being the frequent object of McDowell's wrath, simply because he is in love with the lovely D'Angelo. Several centerfold models appear, frequently naked, as featured extras. It's all played out amid some spectacular sets and vivid costumes in an attempt to appear Fellini-esquire. What was intended to be a deeply dramatic spectacle, penned by Gore Vidal, is instead a lavish, but garish, parade of blood, skin, depravity, perversity and pornography, since the final cut (complete with added XXX scenes) was engineered by Penthouse publisher and the film's producer Guccione. That is not to say that the film isn't eye-poppingly captivating in a can't look away, shock value sort of manner. Several scenes occur which are practically unforgettable.
