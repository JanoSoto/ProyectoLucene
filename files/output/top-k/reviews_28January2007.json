I think they were showing movies of Melanie Griffith because Working Girl had become so popular at the time, and they were showing what a range this actress had from action-adventure to abused secretary. And Melanie Griffith does have that range.Cherry 2000 didn't look finished when I saw it, but what I loved about ti was it's story. I've all but forgotten about it until recently when one of the premiere movie channels showed it. In looking at it now, it could easily be renamed The Real Desperate Housewives of Orange County - this film was really perceptive for 1987 - and it's only 20 years later! There is a running joke in the film that makes me review Cherry 2000 this way - back then, I didn't catch it. Today, it's really funny.The joke They ask the man looking to replace his robot where is he from? He replies Anaheim. That's in Orange County. Why is it a joke? Well...Cherry 2000 was a female robot that was made as a companion for men. She was blonde, pretty, perfect breasts, perfect hips, very attentive to her man, had an A.I. chip of all the right things to say, all the right things to do.Cherry 2000 was perfect for coming home to when he had such a long day at work. This man was used to his Cherry 2000 and his A.I. Cherry 2000 program that was programmed to look, sound and do whatever he wanted. Unfortunately, Cherry 2000 short circuited and he needed to get a new one. In trying to replace his Cherry 2000, he found that it was obsolete. The body, but not the chip. Newer models of female robots were available but he was really into his Cherry 2000 (Another running joke is the line Ah, yes, a Cherry 2000! Great hip action!) so it was suggested that there might be a Cherry 2000 model out in the wastelands of robots. He could take his pre programmed chip and insert it into one of those Cherry's. Only way to get there was to find a 'tracker' to take him in to the Wasteland and get one.The only sane and semi-honest tracker he could find was a woman - gasp - a real woman, Played by Melanie Griffith. Melanie was skilled, tough and also...feminine. So, this man had to go into dangerous robotic wasteland territory with a real flesh and blood woman to find a Cherry 2000 robot that he thought was the only woman that could make him happy.As I pointed out, the story was a good story, the acting was fine, the production and post production values were light which took away from a lot for me as I watched it. It was kinda on the Mad Max level of production but for this story it needed more production values to succeed.It is a cautionary tale - and it looks as though it was perceptive. We are there, especially in Orange County with the pre-fabricated, programmed woman. This is not a Stepford Wife, per ce. But it is an ideal and a manipulation of what some men think a woman should be, say and do all by the flick of a control - easy to control as flipping on a light switch. That is, until - you re-insert yourself among real humans, real women, non altered flesh and blood and find out what you're really missing, which our male does.A funny, nice, low-key production, cautionary tale, action, love story film.

(If you are not, you should be.) When I was very young, this was the one story of all stories that I wanted to become a movie - and I had it all in my mind. This is utterly not so.Asimov's stories took science fiction in a direction that few other authors could. Robots for him were not simply scientific inventions, but the height of human achievement progressing beyond our current civilization. This movie thus contradicts itself, practically in every scene as well as in the story line.The Robot Andrew Martin (Robin Williams), when introduced in the movie, is shown to have human emotions, but ranking in intelligence below that of a medically certified idiot. Although Andrew's intelligence evolves through the movie, the return every once in a while to slap-stick style comedy (the yes-no-yes-no scene with Little Miss and Portia (Embeth Davidtz), the poke-me-in-the-eye scene) detriments much from the story as well as the character of Andrew. It is hard to believe that after traveling the world, the now 62 year old Andrew would say fecal matter and not know to say a piece of sh*t. Pearls before Swan? Swine Lake? And why, why, why, why, why, why is farting supposed to be funny? This is not that kind of a movie.Asimov, in his mind, was already in the world where robots existed the way he portrayed them. His stories would reflect in many dimensions on how he perceived this world. The Bicentennial Man was perhaps his best canvas for this world, as it takes us through 200 years of the future. The speed of development and progress, not only scientifically but also as mankind, was evident through the story.The movie falls so short of this. The negative portrayal of NorthAm Robotics (a.k.a. U.S. Robots and Mechanical Men to Isaac Asimov) is just one small part of the disappointment. They were not the deceitful organization as the movie makes them to be (or at least the one man shown to represent the entire organization).The attempt to become free, while becoming a legal battle in the book, is a conversation of a few seconds.Andrew's evolving humanity, according to the book, is entirely his with others supporting him in the endeavor. This convinces the reader that Andrew IS human, and the world failing to recognize him makes the reader feel for him. It leaves the reader in wonder that something created by humans COULD be human.The movie shows Andrew's humanity to be a series of ideas placed by others, and therefore not his own. I came away thinking that he didn't really deserve it, which means the movie completely failed for me. The reason why he wants to be declared human (because apparently he has a desire to make love) demeans not just the book, but humanity itself. By the way, what happened to the Sesquicentennial Robot?And then jarringly, Andrew becomes the character of the book, but without the connecting points. Suddenly he stands in front of the court asking to be a human. Andrew's claim that he has invented prosthetic devices comes as a great surprise, for up to this point Rupert Burns (Oliver Platt) is the man we see doing this work.And so on and on and on.There are so many times that the movie absolutely fails Asimov, but those that bother me the most are the ones that Asimov took specific pains to point out his world and the movie blatantly denies it to him. The scene of Galatea (Kiersten Warren) shouting at Rupert Burns is impossible by Asimov's Three Laws. He has several complete stories of how even mentally hurting a human being creates such conflict in a robot (Liar!, is one example) as to destroy it. The nurse in the final scene, presumably an android robot, under orders unplugs Portia &#150; which essentially renders every robot story written by Asimov meaningless.Yes, I am disappointed.Movies need not stick to the original storyline, and often do not have the time to show every aspect of the book. Certainly, The Bicentennial Man was a long story (it is somewhere between a short story and a book) to be captured in its full essence in 90 minutes. That, however, is not an excuse here. This could have been broken down into sequels, especially in these days of trilogies. I wait for another production of this story true to Asimov.

I only see an important political problem, important 35 years ago and as important in our days - think of the Twin Towers assault.The idea of maximal freedom for the individual is very attractive. The snag is of course, that there are some evil human creatures around abusing this freedom. It is possible to close your eyes and not think about it of course. But if you are honest, you have to. The first thing Dirty Harry makes clear, is that liberals and socialists have to pay a price. I think civil rights are absolute, the idea to restrict them in favour of safety\/security is wrong. In The Netherlands Pim Fortuyn and Theo van Gogh have paid with their lives, like the two girls killed by Scorpio.So is Harry Callahan right? Of course not. Don Siegel and Clint Eastwood portray him on purpose as a racist and a loose canon. Just ask a random police officer, if he wants to work with a guy like Callahan. The final scene is symbolic Callahan does not belong in the police corps and he knows it. If you are right wing, ask yourself some questions. With your son or daughter in the bus - or even better if that fishing kid were your son - would you want Callahan taking those risks? Here we see the only, but a big fault of the movie when Callahan shoots Scorpio in the shoulder, the kid should have been killed. But I suppose, that would be too shocking. It would have been reality though.Harry Callahan himself also pays a high price. He has does not have a family life. Ask some policemen; the doubts of Gonzales' wife are very real. Callahan does not have friends. Also notice, that Callahan's sex life consists of peeping. One of his partners has been killed; the other is in hospital, where Gonzales ends as well.All you right wing people, can you honestly say, that it is worth taking these risks? Especially, when your family, friends and relatives are involved? Dirty Harry Callahan has a strong right wing political view. The movie has not. Essential is the scene, when Gonzales asks his superior, if it is right not to give Callahan a cover up. Lieutenant Bessler's answer is honest he does not know. No matter your political views, you need blinkers to answer Gonzales' question.This is exactly, why Dirty Harry is superior to all the other tough cops movies, with types like Bronson, Gibson, Willis and Segal. Dirty Harry is unsettling, because it leaves the spectator without answers. This is underlined by the fact, that regular police surveillance in the movie saves two lives ...Two final remarks. Nobody has noticed the similarities between Scorpio and El Indio. I only mention them, as they are obvious. Andy Robinson is great, but I think Gian Maria Volonte even more frightening. I also find it amazing, that so many people think Dirty Harry violent. Please, do a body count and compare with hard boiled movies since 1980 until today. The fact is of course, that there are not that many victims. The good guys get hurt as well. Neither is there any beauty in the violent scenes. Violence is portrayed like it is in reality nasty, dirty, painful. It is present, today even more than in 1971, and there is no good way to deal with it.

I thought to myself, how bad could this be? I mean, what DON'T they show in movies these days? Should I allow my teenage children to see the film? What WAS this scene, and were there more like it? No review was specific as to answering my questions, so my husband and I watched it alone. Here is what that one scene is A rather graphic scene (zoomed in and lasting a couple of seconds) of a nobleman's genitalia as he is urinating on an aged, disabled nobleman who had ridiculed him some 30 years earlier. Perhaps the outrage, shock and disgust felt by these male reviewers was due to the fact that instead of the typical female nudity we see everywhere in movies, for once we saw graphic male nudity. Who would've thought men to be so prudish? Now, before all you men out there attempt to perform your own version of witty repartee' and strike back at these comments, allow me to add that yes, while this one scene was graphic and shocking, that it was not done for the sake of shock, but rather to show what lengths people in positions of power went to in order to protect their own positions and sabotage that of others, ranging from ridicule and humiliation to violence and death. While I do not condone gratuitous nudity for the sake of pornography, I do feel this one scene accurately sets the tone of the tale and has meaning in it's ending.For some time I could not understand how the plight of so many French citizens could be so desperate and full of starvation and death while the wealthy did not suffer the same fate, and why nobody did anything to change this. If the portrayal of those in positions of power and wealth in this movie was depicted accurately, it is easy to understand how a once great country failed it's citizens when power and choice was held by those who were selfish, lazy, and possibly worse - silly. King Louis XVI has been written to be by many accounts, a man not able to rule, passive, indifferent to those around him near and far, and unable to repair the damage done by his predecessors, especially King Louis XIV when also abandonment of reason and over indulgence were the rule of the day.Along with the beautiful countryside, architecture and decor, costumes (couldn't they give poor Mathilde more than two dresses to wear during the entire film?) and great depiction of human nature and our inherent weaknesses, this movie was very entertaining and for me much more enjoyable than Valmont\/Dangerous Liaisons to which it has been compared. While Valmont\/Dangerous Liaisions also contained the above attributes, Ridicule contained an important element they did not - well developed characters and plot.

Watching Spike Lee movies all these years I know what to expect going into a Spike Lee movie. Incredible dialog, incredible acting, messages or even incredible film scores (courtesy of Terence Blanchard). Spike Lee's 1996 effort Girl 6 however is a tough cookie. Upon seeing it for the first time, I was confused. There were a lot of elements in this film that I hadn't seen in any of Spike's films before. The cameos and the attempt to make this a straight forward comedy was some of the things I had never seen Spike do. But I had confidence in him and knew that he'd make this film watchable. Over the years I had been on the fence about this film and couldn't really figured out what I liked about this film. Was it the fact that it was a Spike Lee joint? Was it the incredible Prince soundtrack? So I decided to sit down and analyze the DVD of the film. We meet an actress (Theresa Randle) in the middle of an audition being conducted by Quentin Tarantino. We witness her walking out on the part because of demands and we also see her being dropped by her agent and kicked out of her acting class. Down on her luck, she looks in the classifieds and find phone sex companies looking for new ladies. She takes the job and we see Girl 6 blossom before our eyes. She has her highs and lows in the business but remains an aspiring actress at heart. Complete with fantasy scenes, Prince music, cameos and Spikes trademark shots Girl 6 was an OK comedy at best. Scenes made me cringe (see the Jeffersons\/Good Times fantasy sequence), some made me laugh and the ending left me disappointed. I had now come to see what everyone disliked about the movie. But it wasn't as bad as everyone made it seem. Sure its a Spike Lee joint but don't expect it to be on the level of Do The Right Thing, Malcolm X or Bamboozled. Spike lapsed on this one but it still has its moments. 8 years after Girl 6, Spike would suffer the same fate in 2004's She Hate Me. Maybe comedy isn't his thing but Girl 6 (also see his child friendly 1994 film Crooklyn) separated him from the angry and controversial persona that the press made him out to be.

A classic is also something that everyone praises but no one has read. -Mark Twain'Classic' seems to be the word used to describe Scarface, Brian DePalma's 1983 film about opulence, self surrender, greed, and danger among Florida's drug ring. People and critics (and rappers for that matter) deem this film 'an epic gangster classic' or 'eptiome of gangster films.' When it is anything but. It is praised for all the wrong reasons. Scarface is a terrific film that deserves praise from all over, but not all the praise it gets from audiences today, and therefor the fine points it so poignantly makes are missed by the general public.First off, the film is about a Cuban refugee, with a past of wanting to escape communism grasp and find happiness. Simple? Yes. But the layers of De Palma's directing genius, and the great story written by Oliver Stone (yes I know, he actually wrote a real good one here) play into all of it. The characters are all looking for an escape, as escape is a natural element dealt with in the film by all. Each character has something to offer, that makes them likable by everyone who could appreciate this film. They are entwined in a world of mystique and money, but all that has a price, as they all learn. Each character thinks they are getting better chances in life, when in true dramatic irony, they are actually getting worse. 'Tragedy' would be a better word to describe this movie. All those who praise the film for it's drug usage, it's violence, it's dialog, totally missed the point. There is nothing really positive about the film besides the characters positive expectations of themselves. And that is why the film works so well. The devastation through out the film serves to deliver the message of the film, not to look cool or attract viewers. Brian De Palma doesn't make movies for cult gangsters, or brainless action fans.Next on, the film is an adult drama. It is not a 'gangster film'. It has it's share of action, but the action is plotted very carefully, so it has a point. It's not like Aliens- an example of a big dumb action film, and most audiences perceive this film as a big dumb action gangster film about doing drugs and shooting people. Ridiculous. Hogwash. If this film is about that, then it is about how bad it is. Not a promotion of it. This being said, the film is indeed a great film. It has great cinematography that pulls you into the story. It has a very dramatic score (in true Giorgio Moroder style), which simply could give you chills, or bring you to tears. The film is rather lengthy, but it is a story, and each moment counts. The acting is terrific. Al Pacino - enough said. He can do any role that he puts his mind to, and this was no exception. Pretty boy Steven Bauer, as Manny. I didn't think much of him in other films he did, but he actually makes you like him when he goes under maestro De Palma's direction. Michelle Pfeiffer is a true gem as Elvira. Popping' fresh off the heels of a sort of embarrassment in Grease 2 she got her ticket to ride performing a no holds barred performance of a beauty that is more than meets the eye. But the three true diamonds in this rough are Mary Elizabeth Mastrontonio as Tony's sister Gina, who when she smiles, or cries, we see her soul and her fresh way of living, and watch it deteriorate; Paul Shenar as Alejandro Sosa, a drug lord, who runs deeper than a river, and Shenar portrays him as so; and Miriam Colom as Tony and Gina's torn mother. These three dig the film as deep as it can go. This reviewer learned one main thing when watching Scarface for the first time. Always go into a film unsuspecting. All the hype and talk of this film cannot possibly prepare you for what you really see. Only knowing De Palma (like I do) can give you even a glimpse of what this film holds.

The comedy is pure genius, not only because of the writing and directing, but the incredible performance of Steve Martin, playing the world's most lovable, humorous, Jerk, Navin R. Johnson! We all know the story by now, and if anyone hasn't seen this movie you've been living under a rock for 28 years!Navin R. Johnson, raised by poor Mississippi Black Sharecroppers, on his birthday feels different like he doesn't belong. His Mother reveals the shocking news, Navin's not their natural born child! But we raised you like you were one of us! Navin delivers the spine-splitting laughter comment, You mean I'm gonna stay this color? and gets depressed. One night, however, he hears a catchy jazz tune on the radio (The song BTW is called Crazy Rhythm.) and starts dancing around the house all excited and motivated! This is the kind of music that tells me to go out there and be somebody!!!! With renewed energy and a new outlook on life, Navin sets out to find his Special Purpose. (Which he KNOWS is out there.)However, his lack of intelligence lands him in some of the funniest situations ever seen in any movie. For instance, he gets a job at a gas station where the owner persuades him to work for $1.10 an hour! How much? Navin asks. The owner repeats, $1.10 an hour. Navin is overcome with emotion, You'll pay me, $1.10 if I work here an hour!!!??? He than writes back home to his familyFolks, I got this great job at a gas station! I don't wanna say how much I'm making, but let's just say IT'S A LOT!! I'm enclosing $2.00!Watch for so many scenes like this and some all-time great lines by Steve Martin as only he can deliver them. Comedy doesn't get any better. You are guaranteed to crack up every time you watch this movie!Standouts are when he is being chased by a sniper at a gas station! Navin makes some HILARIOUS comments about cans that he thinks are defective because the sniper is shooting at him and keeps hitting the cans!!! These cans are defective!!! Navin says, There springing leaks! STAY AWAY FROM THE CANS!!! Navin also takes jobs at a traveling carnival roadshow as a weight-guesser and has more great lines when a Midway participant asks what prizes he can win! There he meets a very jealous motorcycle lady. (There is some course R-rated situations in this part of the movie.)He also meets a dear sweet lady played by Bernadette Peters in a WONDERFUL supporting role. A bizarre invention makes him a millionaire, but the effects of the product force him into a lawsuit in which he loses everything and goes back to the foster family that still loves him.Steve Martin was BORN to play this role! I can't say enough great things about this classic film! The only problem is that the theatrical version is missing a lot of alternative clips that can be found on the TV version These include1.) Navin elaborating with Mr. Hartoonian at the gas station about making $1.10\/hr.2.) A Texas Millionaire conning Navin into giving money to fix the cracked seats on his airplane.3.) Navin, depressed and despondent in a scene where after Marie leaves him, he goes up on an amusement park ride feeling so broke that he had to spin.4.) Navin telling his Mother that he had been waiting for his skin to change color, any year now. I have been waiting for Universal to release a DVD of The Jerk that contains this added footage It may be awhile, so I will probably just have to get the DVD as is. It would be nice to have these added scenes included on a future DVD.However, this is a movie that is brilliant on all counts and only seems to get even better with time!

Nothing strange in that. In 2006, with the on-going Iraq war and the massive tensions between Western and Islamic values, more Americans would vote for a Muslim than an atheist. Now THAT is alarming.I'm not making a statement against Muslims here. I'm just shocked that, in spite of the Islamophobia, in spite of the radical fundamentalists in (nuclear?) Iran, in spite of the Muslims holding the no. 1 spot as Villains in movies, news and culture, Americans still think atheists are more untrustworthy.This is one of Contact's points. Without spoiling anything, it's safe to say that Jodie Foster's character is held back thanks to her (non)-belief. Instead, the good stuff goes to the believer, and in a spot of irony, it's also lost thanks to a believer. When I first saw Contact, I didn't find it very realistic that all the religious people would be more content with choosing a contending religion instead of a neutral part, but the numbers above stumps me.All politics aside, Contact is a great movie. The first scene sets the scope perfectly and beautifully. Some scenes are very, very tense, thankfully avoiding the Hollywood Happy Music and instead going for a subtle, dramatic and threatening score.This and Silence of the Lambs will always be the two best Jodie Foster movies. Even though she is a great actress, I can't believe she will ever top this. She is nicely balanced by Matthew McConaughey, who, coincidentally, is a man of faith. Jake Busey plays a truly unsettling character, Joseph, who shows the greatest sides of blind faith. We even get to see some of William Fichtner, which I always consider a bonus in a movie.The plot is grand, to say the least. Carl Sagan always was a man of visions and even though I have not read the book, I can feel the scope and scale of it is very Sagan. Some people mean that Sagan's strong anti-religious stance in the book is diluted in the movie, which may or may not be true. Personally, I think a movie that wants to open a dialog is worth more than one dismissing the other idea all together.When all's said and done, Contact is one of the greatest science-fiction movies ever made, in the genre's purest form. People who dislike Star Wars, Star Trek, Alien and the like, should not worry; Contact is thoughtful and more about humanity than anything else. It's rating here at IMDb, an American site, reinforces the aforementioned figures. Had it been the same movie with a pro-religious message, I think this would have been high up in the top 250, and I hope that one day it will be.

The script, The plot, and all the song and dance numbers were replaced by new Hollywood friendly alternatives, with only the big show stopper 'Night and Day' and the original title remaining.Even then the title had to be eventually altered to appease the newly legally bolstered Hay's office, who did not want RKO suggesting to the world that a divorce was something big, clever or enjoyable, so they were forced to add an extra 'e' to 'divorce', which put the emphasis on the emotional state of the divorced character instead.It strikes me as ludicrous that Hay's and his band of do-gooder numpties, could see and accept that a woman coming out of a miserable marriage could be happy, yet maintain that the divorce which brought about this accepted state of euphoria still had 'straight to hell' implications. Crazy man!So with a story and title that bared little or no resemblance to the show originally purchased, production finally went underway on the first Astaire\/Rogers starring vehicle, 'The Gay Divorcée'.Astaire plays American stage\/movie dancer Guy Holden in England on an extended Holiday accompanied by incompetent but good natured barrister Egbert Fitzgerald played wonderfully by Edward Everett Horton.Here Holden meets fellow American Mimi Glossop (Ginger Rogers) and despite the embarrassing start to their relationship, they soon start the beginnings of a romance. In addition to this and unbeknown to Guy, Ms. Glossip is in England to secure a divorce from her estranged husband and has employed Guy's friend Egbert to handle the affair.Egbert's plan is to hire a co-respondent with whom Mimi must act out an illicit affair in a seaside hotel bedroom for the benefit of some hired detectives, which will then give her husband reasons to file for divorce. However when Egbert arrives at the resort with friend Guy in tow, Mimi wrongly assumes Guy is the co-respondent and is disgusted by his suspected line of work.When Guy is invited to Mimi's room for the entire night (the main crux of the divorce plan) there follows an uncomfortable atmosphere, of contempt an loathing from Mimi and confusion and desire from Guy.What then happens when her Aunt, the real co-respondent and Mimi's husband arrive on the scene???

The movie also stars one of my favorite actors, Sean Penn. Excellent here, as always.The great acting and storyline is further enhanced by a wonderful score and beautiful camera work. Even if you're not a great war movie fan, please see this. It is so different and, like me, will be a film you can watch many times. Probably my favorite movie, in any genre, of all time. Awesome.

There is the one thing being the fact that this film concentrates more on the villains whether than Batman, but considering the brilliance of this film I thought it all worked out very well.Why? Burton juggled the actual comics continuity of Catwoman and Penguin and made them characters of tradegies. As a Die Hard Batman fan, I thought this was an excellent move, at least as far as cinematics go. I think this because the villains have more of a connection personally to Batman cause as we all know, Batman is a character of tradegy himself, not to mention a someone of purest darkness. Catwoman and Penguin are placed into that very darkness he is but in different doses and they have different morals. As a viewer, it was a very smooth combination of characters.As Batman, Michael Keaton makes a grand return. The best Batman by far, Keaton's frightening, and sometimes even depressing facial expressions brought out who Batman is. You can tell of the personal conflict and struggle he copes within himself. That was the beauty of Keaton's performance. He doesn't have to even say anything, you can just tell its there. Michelle Pfeifer was hands down fabulous. A grade A performance as Catwoman, so seductive, and just about what everybody else said about her at the time of this films release. Not to mention the fact that she brought out the tortured soul within perfectly as well. Equal in Keaton's performance as the Bat, Pfeifer pulled off his feminine opposite and with such style. DeVito couldn't have been a better choice for Penguin. Cruel, Sadistic, Funny, and Sad he highlighted them all within the character, and I'm happy Burton went with him. If I'm not mistaken Dustin Hoffman was at one point considered for the role and I don't think that would have worked out good.The movie itself is visually stunning once again, the view of Gotham was perfect, at times I felt like I was actually in a comic book, cinematic art to a marvelous perfection (if that makes any sense). Not to mention Danny Elfman's staggering theme.A perfect Batman film.

This stated that any teachings going against the Divine Creation of man as is taught in the Bible is prohibited. This teacher, John T. Scopes, taught his class Darwin's Theory of Evolution and how humans come from a long line of animals. The trial that ensued would be one of the most memorable in US history.Director Stanley Kramer's Inherit the Wind, based on the real 1925 Scopes Trial, brings to life one of the most controversial court cases of all time. Using three power houses of the big screen, there are bound to be some fireworks in what once was a small, quiet Tennessee town.Spencer Tracy, Frederic March, and Gene Kelly electrify the courtroom with passion and intensity. After hearing what has happened to the teacher, Bertram T. Cates (Dick York), Henry Drummond (Tracy) is sent down by the Baltimore Herald, more specifically reporter E.K. Hornbeck (Kelly). The prosecution however has some fire power of its own. Once considered a candidate for the presidency, Matthew Harrison Brady (March) will represent the state.Teaching Darwinism in the Bible Belt of America back in those days certainly would not bring you the right kind of attention. When Drummond and Hornbeck come to town they are greeted with the similar hatred and ignorance that Cates had been approached with. Brady on the other hand is treated like a prophet.Drummond, Brady, and Hornbeck are all based on the real people involved in the trial. Although the names have been changed, facts taken out, and truths stretched, the film serves its purpose. Certainly the most intense moments of the film are between Drummond and Brady, the two heavyweights going at it on and off the stand.Tracy and March's dynamic performances feed off of each other bringing you to the edge of your seat. The hot summer days spent in that courtroom are brought to a boil when these go at it. One interesting aspect of this relationship is that after a day in court, the two can be seen socializing, reminiscing of times gone by, as if nothing had just happened earlier.Probably the most intense and emotionally driven part of the film is the scene where Drummond has called Brady to testify. This too happened in the real Scopes trial and is one of the boldest attempts taken at a trial. Tracy and March shine in their characters as the two men square off in a war of words about the Bible and Darwin's the Origin of Species. The fiery debate of whether or not a man has the right and the power to think on his own and to teach this theory of evolution. A truly compelling scene that will leave a person drained from excitement.The film in its entirety is exceptionally well made. Kramer does an excellent job of selling the tension between Cates and the townspeople. We get to see the ugly side of what happens when people are not accepting and only believe that they are right. The song Old Time Religion played throughout the film is a nice accompaniment displaying the feel and attitude of the situation.No matter what your belief is of the creation or evolution of humans, this film speaks volumes about how far we have come as society on a whole, and how we still have a long way to go.

He can play these goofy roles (i.e. George Of The Jungle and he can get serious and be effective, too, as in The Quiet American.)Overall, it's good lightweight entertainment. Don't expect much, and you'll be pleasantly surprised. At least, that's the way I found it.

It is stupid? Yeah, in parts. Is the theology sound? Hardly, but there was more truth than fiction uttered in this film, believe it or not. Is the Devil made to look attractive? Well, yeah, I'd say Elizabeth Hurley is pretty attractive!The beginning is the best part of the film, and the end - with a dumb New Age message - is the worst.

Hawks was at his best here. Everything in the film is strictly utilitarian. The camera shoots only from eye level. The set design, props, and wardrobe are perfunctory, sort of generically western. Hawks doesn't reach for anything beyond the immediate pleasure of watching what's on the screen. No messages, except maybe that friends have to stick together and that pride doesn't goeth before a fall but rather is an intrinsically admirable quality.Hawks takes a boyish delight in having his characters display a kind of boy-scout level ingenuity. You want to knock Sheriff John Wayne out? You simply string a line across the bottom of the staircase, have a woman scream, and when Wayne comes rushing down the stairs he trips over the line and is knocked conveniently out. Maybe you want to have two people communicate with one another without revealing their presence. You have them creep around and whistle to one another like bird imitators. This device is used not only out of doors (at night) but inside a big hotel. It might be argued that big hotels don't have birds in their hallways but who cares? The film rarely deals seriously with any of its elements. Yes, Dean Martin is a recovering alcoholic (barely) and there is occasional genuine friction between him and Wayne, and of course there is the question of seeing justice done, but it's all handled rather lightly. The problems are all overwhelmed by the humor that Hawks and screenwriter Furthman have laid on. Gonzales-Gonzales contributes mightily to the amusement quotient. When Wayne learns that Angie Dickinson, who has the hots for him, has stayed up all night to protect him, he tells Gonzales-Gonzales, Well, you can . . . tell her for me that . . . the fool. Gonzales-Gonzales Jew want me to tell her that sheece a fool? Wayne What? No! I'll tell her myself. Gonzalez-Gonzalez Jew are going to tell her that sheece a fool? It isn't that funny in print but the way the two actors play this scene is exquisite.Props are there mainly to provide little details of interest, some important and some not, but they wouldn't be there in the first place if they weren't going to be used. A black hat. A set of six shooters. A potted plant.The inevitable climactic shoot out dissolves into outright mischief. The good guys have the bad guys penned up in a warehouse and practically squealing with joy they bombard the building with sticks of dynamite, seeing who can throw farthest or most accurately. Everybody joins in the fun and a good time is had by all, including the viewer.Hawks decided to make Rio Bravo after watching High Noon, a story about a sheriff who goes around town asking for help and gets none. High Noon is sometimes interpreted as a metaphor for the McCarthy witch hunts. Anyone accused of having been a communist was automatically alienated from the community and deserted by his friends. Hawks was disgusted by the message, as undoubtedly John Wayne and, especially, Ward Bond were. Rio Bravo was designed to serve as a riposte to the earlier film, but none of that shows on the screen. What we see on the screen are a crew and cast that seem to be having enormous fun.
