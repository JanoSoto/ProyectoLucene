Cameron has created without doubt the most realistic and believable fictional world and characters ever seen. The space marines are tough and speak like real military personnel. I believe this was achieved by sending the actors to military style boot camps where actors were in character (I.e a commander was to be obeyed). I also read that actors whose characters had not met were kept separate for a more realistic interaction when filming started. They act like real people not badly written robotic characters that show no fear\/emotion. When these guys are scared they look terrified and with good reason. Introducing the first scary aliens ever presented in a movie. HR Gigers creature design plays on the psyche with its flawless but deadly physiology. The aliens move in a silky, graceful motion and are believable as silent deadly predators. I read that this was achieved by using ballet dancers to achieve the poise and grace required for such a perfect killer.I have never seen a film so well structured as Aliens. Every scene has vital part to play in the movie. When I finally saw the extra scenes in the directors cut I was even more impressed. These were fantastic scenes but were removed to give perfect balance.Every actor\/actress in this movie deserves an Oscar. It is a master class in the portrayal of a wide variety of emotions. Sigourney Weaver's Ripley feels so real you could almost reach into the screen and touch her. She obviously understood exactly what Cameron wanted from the role. Other special mentions go to Bill Paxton and Michael Biehn who play very convincing soldiers.In short this is the final word in sci-fi movies. All sci-fi to date has taken something from Aliens and it's easy to see why. It's not only a triumph in the sci-fi genre though, this is a template for how great any movie can be. If you haven't seen it yet I am VERY jealous. I wish I could erase it from my memory and see it again for the first time. It is in my opinion the best movie ever made by some way. Do not think I am some sci-fi fanatic and am just obsessed with this movie, it just really is that good! If you haven't seen it yet you're I'm for a real treat!

The viewpoint shift, allowing viewers to watch the familiar tale play out from the perspective of a serving woman in the Doctor's household, gives both a romantic edge to the picture and makes points about the place and role of women\/servants in English society in Jeckyl's day. Roberts is very good as the lowest member of the household staff, trying to hold the Doctor himself and the household together while at the same time striving not to get above her station. And the grim, nearly black-and-white, dread-filled landscape of the picture is great to look at and memorable.

From knocking over the stones of Stonehenge, to staying in the smallest hotel in all of England, to Eric Idle's hilarious three scenes only performance as an injured bike rider, seen frequently throughout the film. You'll find yourself laughing at the original one-liners, and all the hilarious situations. Do yourself a favor, and see this movie, along with all the other movies!

The General is a slapstick feast, its scenes perfectly timed, all the way action packed, sometimes dangerously so - e.g. when Keaton is famously sitting on one of the coupling rods with the train moving, or when he ingeniously gets rid of obstacles in front of the track while moving towards them.

I believe Ang Lee didn't have a story in mind and just utilized some ideas from Moody's novel. In many scenes we can notice that the filmmakers don't know what to do, so they just have the characters talking to each other. The cast is profession, we can see they really get into their characters, but that's not enough to make this movie any good. The only thing that enjoyed me is the braveness they have at showing how kids start their sexual life. You know, I'm only 19, so I can vaguely remember how these things worked in my mind when I was a kid. You're always worried what would happen if your parents found out, and in the end, they're doing their best to not see it.
