Something marketable, something mainstream, something that you could go see as a family. The director? Joel Schumacher. The film? Batman Forever. Though Tim Burton still stayed with the film as a producer, which is probably the main reason why this film is still considered to be a decent portrayal of Batman.Because yeah, it's not a bad film by any means. It definitely succeeded in being more accessible, plus it made a tidy profit for Warner Bros., which always helps. But at its core it still feels like a Batman film. It has most of the needed elements. It has a good Bruce Wayne in Val Kilmer. Not Keaton or Bale good, but he still pulls off the character. It has a magnificent villain in Jim Carrey's Riddler. Because honestly, who else would you have picked to play the Riddler? I'm of two minds about Tommy Lee Jones's Two-Face. On the other hand, it's Tommy Lee Jones. On the other hand, I don't think the movie really needs Two-Face. His character is completely overshadowed by the Riddler, making him more aggravating than anything, as he is taking away screen time from the main villain. Plus the story would work just fine without him.It's also nice to see an origins story for Robin (Chris O'Donnell), although I think that O'Donnell wasn't the perfect guy to play the role. He comes off as too arrogant and cocky to be in any way likable.Batman Forever is not the perfect Batman film in any way, but I'm glad it exists. Jim Carrey's performance alone means that it's worth a watch for any fan of Gotham and its inhabitants, plus it has enough Burton in it to please even without our enigmatic man in green.
