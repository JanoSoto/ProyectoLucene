There's Tommy, the heroic one. Chuckie the scardie one, Phil the sarcastic one and his twin Lil, the talkative one. But in reality, the babies are at a baby shower. Anybody who saw the family tree prequel episodes knows that Didi is pregnant. Angelica tells Tommy that once the baby comes, Tommy will be forgotten. Though quite doubtful, he disagrees. Down in the basement, Stu works on his latest invention while Drew taunts him. Stu's latest masterpiece The Reptar Wagon. It's like an ordinary child's wagon only it's shaped like Reptar. Well before long, it's time for Didi to be rushed to the hospital and Tommy's new baby brother, Dylan Prescot Pickles, is born. He immediately beings slobbering, hitting Tommy with his rattle and wailing all night. Didi and Stu begin focusing all their attention onto Dil so Tommy feels left out. Stu gives Tommy his old watch and tells him he has responsibility now.        Then one day, Phil, Lil and Chuckie load Dil in the Reptar wagon and decide to take him back to the hostical. Tommy tries to stop them and before they realize what's happening, they're rolling down the freeway in the Reptar Wagon. They take a detour into the forest. They were lost with absolutely no clue where they were and worse of all they had to change Dil's diapey.         Angelica takes off after them because Dil had snatched her Cynthia doll before they pulled out. The parents soon find their kids gone and immediately go searching for them. Back in the woods, the kids run afoul of some circus monkeys that escaped from a wrecked circus train. They were going in the direction Tommy's watch, or sponsetility was pointing. They were actually trying to find The Lizard to wish to get home; Stu took to the skies in one of his inventions to find the kids while Howard, Betty, Chas, Drew, Charlotte and Didi went with some park rangers. Before long, Angelica catches up with the babies; Tommy accepts Dil and learns to love him; the kids meet up with their parents! Now with Dil included in their games, the kids' lives got better rather than going back to normal.        A pretty good movie. It was cute. It was also a good idea! It's sequel Rugrats in Paris wasn't as good. Because it's a sequel. We've already seen Rugrats in the theaters so that isn't much of a novelty anymore. But what was good about Rugrats in Paris is that Chuckie's dad, Chas, get's married to a fabulous woman Kira Watanabe. And she had a kid, Kimi, who's brave like Tommy. Only thing was, in that movie, Angelica was a bigger brat than in this one. Sheesh! Where's a whipping rod when you need one? Anyhoo, The first one is always the best. I hear there will be a third Rugrats movie. It's where they visit the Wild Thornberrys, I think. But in conclusion, I recommend The Rugrats Movie!

Enid and her friend seem unusually cruel to others and hipper than thou. Although I sympathize with their hatred of popular students and popular culture, they were so bratty and mean I almost stopped watching the movie. Fortunately, the movie explains itself better later on.The beauty of this film is its unhappy endings. The movie almost purposely teases the audience with the hope of happy-ever-afters. When the art teacher gives Enid the college scholarship, you think that Enid is finally going to find some happiness in her life, but Enid fails the class (twice!)--and if you think about it, Enid never did graduate from high school. When Seymour looks through Enid's sketch book and sees that she really does like him, you think they will end up together forever, but they do not. Ghost World is probably more realistic than most movies because not everybody gets what they want in the real world. In the real world, people do lose and not everything works out. But you can walk away kind of knowing that Enid and Seymour will survive because they are true to their own personalities. Enid can't be normal, work at a movie theater, or have an apartment with her friend. She has to catch the bus that everybody has told her doesn't exist. To sum it up in a cliché that would make Enid grimace she has to follow the beat of a different drum.Who is to say what is normal? Enid or Seymour are as about as normal as anybody else. Life is just a ghost world inhabited by all kinds of freaks. Seymour says that he can't see how the rest of the world can be so normal and accept everything--especially popular music. But they are not--from his reclusive, couch potato roommate with chronic bed head to all the weird men Enid cruises at the sports bar, they are many strange characters in this film.This is a must see for fans of indie films and Sundance.

The ending with the bus is a little too cryptic and too much teenage angst are its major flaws, but it's better than most teen films or films in general. And it's a must see for record collectors (but you don't have to collect blues--or, sorry, ragtime--78's to appreciate it!)

The first time we see D'Artagnan fight, there doesn't seem to be any point to it, other than the fact to let us know that he's this amazingly (and somewhat unbelievably) skilled swordsman and fighter.  He also escapes the situation way too easily, thanks to pathetic bluff and a cut away.The only saving grace in this film (in my opinion) is Tim Roth, who had to make due as best he could with a very bad script.  But he looked cool (the only person in this film with any fashion sense whatsoever).  Although later in the film he appears to have borrowed his Aunt Ida's - Sunday church revival meeting hat.Stephen Rea, who I usually find extremely enjoyable to watch - came across as very ineffectual as the Cardinal Richelieu.  Instead of being the great evil and manipulating mastermind, he almost seemed the puppet of Tim Roth's Febre...a character I've never heard of before, who seemed to fill the role previously occupied by Rochefort, as the one eyed man who killed D'Artagnan's father.(oh for Tim Curry's Richelieu)Justin Chamberlain is incredibly dull in this movie, and never seemed to show any emotion.  It almost seemed like he sucked the life out of the actors around him.  His character comes across as a thinly veiled Bruce Wayne.  A young boy who watched his parents get murdered in front of him, but could do nothing.  He's taken in by the kindly older friend of his father's.  He then grows up and trains himself to be the best fighter, to become a hero and stop what happened to his parents from happening again.Athos, Porthos and Aramis might as well not even have been in the film. All of the Musketeers were portrayed as drunken, miserable, arrogant, lazy jerks.  Apparently D'Artagnan is the only one who still holds the ideals of the Musketeers.  It seemed like Athos was only there to avoid the question - Shouldn't there be 3 of them?  He didn't do a damn thing.  They gave all of his character traits to Aramis, and Aramis the wouldbe priest was nowhere to be found.King Louis XIII and Queen Anne were in their late 50's (huh?) and were childless.  Okay, where do Louis XIV and Phillipe come from then?  I somehow doubt that a woman in her late 50's in 17th century France would be up to having twins.  As far as I know, they should have been young, and not even married yet.The Musketeers all seemed closer in age to their Man in the Iron Mask selves, than their Three Musketeers selves.  Athos even had grey in his beard.You would think that the King's Musketeers could have afforded to dress better.  Everyone looked like a bum...and there were a LOT of bad hats in this movie.  D'Artagnan looked like he should have been riding the range in 1880's Oklahoma.  And don't even get me started on the mullets.  Did everyone in 17th century France grow up in the 1980's?  The hair extensions on Justin Chamberlain were pretty bad too.The romance between his character and Mena Suvari didn't make much sense, and seemed very forced.  Although it gave D'Artagnan an excuse to go skinny dipping so the bad guys could kidnap his girlfriend.Bad bad bad dialogue.  When Mena Suvari threatened to cut off someone's balls...I pretty much gave up all hope.The action and fight sequences were way over the top.  Apparently the Cardinal makes sure his men are well versed in the fine art of - How to engage in a swordfight while hanging 100 feet in the air one handed from a rope in the rain and not fall to your death.  The final fight between D'Artagnan and Febre (in what we dubbed The Ladder Room) was too much. It seems the ladders are strong enough to support two grown men who are jumping and balancing on them, but are powerless when it comes to the mighty rapier blade.  It got to the point where I was thinking - for crying out loud, would you just stand still and fight already!D'Artagnan also has this amazing horse that appears out of nowhere when he whistles (despite having run off in a different direction earlier, or having been left lying in the road practically dead that morning).What I found interesting is, it seems that the Musketeers all bought their cassaque cloaks at Disney's The Three Musketeers wardrobe sale.  They looked EXACTLY like the ones worn by Kiefer, Charlie and Oliver...right down the length, colours and embroidery.One of the most confusing moments came when it looked as though a character had been fatally shot, only to remark - I'm not dead.  But there is no clear explanation as to why they aren't dead, and show up later no worse for wear.I guess the palace kitchen staff are very stupid, as none of them realize that some of them have been replaced by imposters, nor does anyone notice that one of the waiters is wearing a sword...well okay, one person notices, but that scene is silly and kinda creepy.Oh and the swords are all pretty ugly.  I'm also trying to figure out, why if they hired a Hong Kong fight director to do all the choreography, did they also have a sword master?Well that's my Musketeer rant.

As mythology, the 'Alien' series has also always been more than just the sum of its parts--consider that famed fantasy\/surrealist artist H. Geiger helped design the look for the original Alien and its hive, and you begin to get at the 'intangible' elements to the series; 'Alien' has always wanted to be that thing crawling straight out of our nightmares. The '79 and '86 films were stark, simple, and brutal, and the '92 film was brooding and disturbing (to say the least).Well. The interesting thing is, the Alien meme doesn't belong to the mythology, but to whoever is creating it. David Fincher's directorial debut was Alien 3; his version of 'nightmare incarnate' seems pretty prudent when you consider his work in something like Fight Club. Why bring this up? I think that Jeunet is just about the most interesting directorial choice for this series, at this point. What, exactly, can we learn from the nightmares of the director of 'Amelie' and 'City of Lost Children'?Simply, I think there is a lot more subtly and a lot more depth in this movie than people are giving it credit for. Many of the spiritual, religious, and human relationships are, in a way, very simple (as they are in Amelie or C.O.L.C.), but they cross-over in some wonderfully complex ways. This is the *only* movie in the 'Alien' series to truly recognize how much the 'Alien' phenomenon comes from our own heads, our own dreams & nightmares . . . the direction of the Alien series is inwards, and this is further 'in' than any of the previous films. The cinematography is appropriately wonderful, too-- fans of the series & genre itself are already spoiled on mood lighting and tension-riddled close-quarters shots, but these things are expressed with all of Jeunet's tremendous gift for mise-en-scene. Ryder is great, and of course so is Weaver; she may be tired of playing Ripley by this point but she has brought to Resurrection a curious maternal passion for Ellen Ripley, who by this point must be pretty damn sick of being chased through air ducts.Overall, this is a beautifully realized vision; it is even, in some strange ways, a comic treatise as well, while still keeping that requisite 'Alien' creepiness. The last scene in the movie is, of course, horrific and even horrible, but even that has its grotesque place within the nightmare vision. Oh - and a fun factoid Sigourney Weaver actually made that over-the-shoulder basketball shot-on the first try.In the end, consider something dear old Nietzsche said (perhaps in anticipation of this series, eh?)

The cinematography is appropriately wonderful, too-- fans of the series & genre itself are already spoiled on mood lighting and tension-riddled close-quarters shots, but these things are expressed with all of Jeunet's tremendous gift for mise-en-scene. Ryder is great, and of course so is Weaver; she may be tired of playing Ripley by this point but she has brought to Resurrection a curious maternal passion for Ellen Ripley, who by this point must be pretty damn sick of being chased through air ducts.Overall, this is a beautifully realized vision; it is even, in some strange ways, a comic treatise as well, while still keeping that requisite 'Alien' creepiness. The last scene in the movie is, of course, horrific and even horrible, but even that has its grotesque place within the nightmare vision. Oh - and a fun factoid Sigourney Weaver actually made that over-the-shoulder basketball shot-on the first try.In the end, consider something dear old Nietzsche said (perhaps in anticipation of this series, eh?) If you stare long enough into the abyss, the abyss stares back. Indeed.

It's time to break it down.Army of Darkness is, I suppose, the third in a series of equally crummy movies.  I have not seen the first two, so I am unable to comment on them.  However, the beginning of Army of Darkness gives us a glimpse of the end of the second one, and I could tell it was just as awful.Army of Darkness is unsuitable for those who enjoy well thought-out movies.  It cannot decide whether it is Action\/Adventure, Horror, or Comedy, and this constant struggle for a genre is anything but satisfying.  Some of the one-liners were funny, yes, but everything else was just really lame.At first I liked the movie.  It reminded me of a really cool PC game known as Serious Sam.  However, Army of Darkness strayed too far past the action\/adventure boundaries and went right into Transylvania.  I was shocked at the sudden change.  First Ash, our rough and tough macho hero who cannot be stopped, was in a medieval castle, then suddenly in a twisted world of scarred trees, plastic boulders, and an unbelievable graveyard.  Unbelievable meaning I can't believe that they actually thought people would accept it.There is a scene involving a windmill that is just outright stupid.  Small spawns inexplicably emerge from Ash and cause many troubles for our hero.  This scene goes on and on, almost endlessly.  Another scene involves Ash attempting to escape from skeletal hands that appear from the ground, and for at least a minute or so we watch as he lies flat on the ground and tangles with these hands.

He provides a little comic relief (too much in some areas) and enough sarcasm and toughness that helps the movie to its feet.But the rest of the movie drags it back under.  It's a flop.  I should probably go into how awful the music sounded, but then I'd end up writing a ten page essay on how screechy music destroys any decent score.

OK, although this movie isn't anywhere near bad, it wasn't nearly as original or as brilliant as many critics claimed. At certain times I felt really uneasy and depressed watching this movie, especially during the scenes with Peter Stormare, whose character is neither funny, nor scary, nor cynical, just plain unlikable in every way. Also the scene with the old woman explaining every detail of the plot in the middle of the movie was blatant exposition and it went on forever. The look of the movie is also extremely ugly at times. Why did it all have to look either blue or grey, why couldn't there be some life and color? I hate Spielberg's new cinematographer Janusz Kaminski, the only movies he shot well were Schindler's List, Saving Private Ryan, and A.I. It baffles me how some people praise the shooting style of the film, and it's even more infuriating to realise that desaturating the color actually demanded a special process, and therefore money. With Private Ryan it worked well, but why the hell was it needed in this film? Sometimes I could barely tell what I was seeing. Now, I'll admit that was one of the few things that bothered me about the movie. The script is at times unpredictable and clever. The performances are all solid. The Cruiser isn't nearly as arrogant and annoying as usual, like he was in Vanilla Sky (awful movie). The effects are quite imaginative at times, although the ugly cinematography never really allows you to appreciate them (completely unlike in A.I.). Some of the direction is inspired, like when the spiders are searching the building, although mostly Spielberg's touch seems absent from the picture. You can tell by the film that there was nothing personal for him in the script; often the direction is flat and obvious. I think the best decision Spielberg could make now is to fire his cinematographer. I can't tell you how irritated I was by the lighting in certain scenes. Just get Dean Cundey back or something! It is truly, extremely ugly at times; it's almost like Kaminski was experimenting on how bad an effects-laden, expensive movie like this could possibly look, and I think he succeeded. I think he tried to do the same with The Lost World, but only with this film he succeeds in making it look ugly all the way through.Now, of course there is a lot to admire as well about the film. The most enjoyable scenes come near the end when we discover just how everything worked, who the real bad guy is, why Cruise was set up. It's handled with admirable clarity and cleverness. Also, at those rare times when the movie intends to be humorous, it succeeds. And of course, it's a lot of fun to see all those surprisingly realistic future gimmicks on the screen.All in all, MR is better than 90% of this year's movies and it's Cruise's best performance since Magnolia. The story is original and complex but never incomprehensible. It's just that it doesn't compare to classic sci-fi movies like The Matrix, Terminator 2, or even Star Wars Episode 2 (although that opinion really is a minority report -)). Some critics are saying it's better than those films, but trust me that's not true. Among Spielberg's movies I would say it ranks about in the same league as A.I. and Saving Private Ryan (both of which were good but not great movies in my opinion).
