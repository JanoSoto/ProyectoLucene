Stargate, Indepedence Day, Godzilla, and probably Day after Tomorrow (haven't seen it yet but from the trailers looks the same) all follow the same action\/adventure\/sci-fi formula created by Mr. Steven Spielberg. Clear sense of who the good guys are and who the bad guys are; storyline centers around action that needs lots of special effects; corny, campy (and in Emmerich's case not funny) jokes; action sequences that are exciting but not too intense, so that young kids can watch; and a light-hearted fun adventure movie that is supposed to leave you with a good warm feeling by the end.Unfortunately for Emmerich, he fails in every aspect of this formula that Spielberg created. And his attempts come off as very superficial. The characters have no depth. The story lines are EXTREMELY predictable, overly simplistic, and because everything feels like a rip-off (unless you have never seen a Spielberg film), leaves you feeling bored, your intelligence insulted, and just wanting to leave, turn it off and go and rent Indiana Jones.This was my all-time worst movie I had ever seen, until I saw Battlefield Earth.

This movie claims that everything that happened from the first movie was five years ago. A new family has moved into the house that was originally owned by the main character from the previous film. A young man, Jesse dreams about the Dreamy killer, Freddy Krueger, with no true explanation as to why.Through Jesse's dreams, the villain comes to him, asking Jesse to Kill For Me... You've got the body, I've got the brains... The movie becomes a young man's self realization that he's not the monster, or perhaps he is.This movie is often considered by most fans and reviewers to be the absolute worst of the series, and for a long time after the initial viewing, I would have had to agree. The movie approaches a subject that is quite different from anything typically viewed of horror films from the 80s or the modern time Homosexuality. Most of the time, gay guys in movies are the new black guy cliché If they are in a movie, they will die first.The movie doesn't even approach homosexuality by that context, but by using a rather confused boy, questioning if he's supposed to be a killer or a normal teenager in a convincing way that sort of brings a great psychological approach on the whole villain spin, and it is mostly effective.However, the movie is nowhere free of flaws like the original. From what I have heard and read from the original writer, he meant for the movie to be about a kid trying to find himself, coming out of the closet in association with the villain taking over this kid. That stuff is implied, but it works. But having Jesse dancing in his room flamboyantly or going to a gay bar reduces any message of acceptance in favor of making people call out the phrase Gay in description of this movie.Another problem is that the movie has its fair share of inappropriate shots and scenes that serve little sense to advance the plot. Killer animals and dumb teenagers at a pool party are the major offenders and definitely amps the movie's camp factor.But even with all that said, I feel like I can support this movie a little bit more than before. It's not the best, but it works with what it had. The film score has absolutely no association with the original movies, and makes the movie scarier, I think. The makeup and horror effects are downright terrifying, and certainly the makeup effects on Freddy Krueger are top notch.It is very difficult to accept a movie that is often the nadir of the whole series, but after reviewing it, I can say I support the movie series and its lowest ranked film a little bit easier than previously said.

A masterpiece. Such innocence. Such humanity. Such wisdom. Such truth. Such is the need to touch the soul of another, and such is the need to seek comfort. Yet tenderness risks so much. Oh to be tender again. Yet who could bear it again?I remember when I was eight years old and I remember what a splash this movie made. I don't really recall that I was told or even understood why, and of course I wasn't taken to see it at that age, at that time, when it was common to keep children ignorant of much they are not today. I'm not sure now that it wasn't the craving of the parents to let themselves drown in the strangeness that is naivety prolonged too long just for the sake of innocence itself rather then some strange desire to protect the children from things they could already begin to feel within themselves but were not allowed to mention or ask about. Though the latter is, even today, what is trumpeted about as the reason for shielding children from things they might not be ready for, I'm beginning to wonder if it isn't really the parents who are just protecting themselves, trying to squeeze out more childhood days from their children for the parents to enjoy before they must finally release their darling children into the fray that tides upon the whims of nature and destiny.This movie came out in 1971. Tonight they played it late on our local PBS station here in Dallas. I'd never seen it and not thought about renting it and watching it in all these 33 years since then.One might say it is simply about a couple of 15 year old boys coming of age. But it is more than that. So much more. In fact, without question, it is about the human condition itself. This is a movie about sex, no doubt about that either.

If you live with someone, see it together and draw him or her close.

But, here's the thing with this movie, and this is something that studios in Hollywood predominately don't care about; if the script is thoroughly nothing special, there is not much the actors or the budget or the special effects can do to redeem the venture. This was a classic example of a sequel that was guaranteed to make money right off the bat, so the quality was a secondary consideration. It would also appear as though the screenwriters did as much sampling from The Fugitive (1993) as possible, from the innocent main fugitive, to the big crash on a prison transfer, to the out-in-the-s**t instigation of a hard-target search by the Gerard, to the thorough lack of possible villains among the characters, and so forth. None of this lead anywhere particularly interesting though, and after it was done, I felt like popping in The Fugitive for the fiftieth time.

This film doesn't have anywhere near the beauty of language and depth of ideas as ...Andre, but it DOES have a pair of perfectly matched performances by actors who manage to build an uncertain situation into a series of what I felt to be real moments between the two of them.Wandering with them through a city that pretty much sleeps from ten till nine, I actually got to care about Jesse and Celine.  Ethan Hawke made his character an endearing boy of a man who knows he's lost but cannot quite accept the idea that he has any other options.  And Julie Delpy kept her character's sense of anger and ennui just enough below the surface to where it wasn't threatening but still seemed to be more in control of her than she wanted to admit.  And scenes I feared would become dumb movie moments shifted into simple occurrences that kept the story going (the poetry scene is a perfect example of that; had the poem not been so Second Year College Poetry, it would have been too cutesy, but mingled with Jesse's near screw-up of the glow it brought Celine, the bit some bite).Overall, this movie was much better than I expected.

She is assigned her first major news story for the newspaper she works for-to go undercover as a high school student befriend the popular cool kids and get a scoop as to what really goes on in the world of high school. Only problem is Josie has never been popular. High School was in fact, a traumatizing experience for her as she was the recipient of quite a lot of teasing and cruel jokes. Josie grabs this assignment, as much to finally fit in as to get a scoop-what she finds is the major premise of the story.Never been kissed is one of those movies that's so sappy and schmaltzy at times, particularly in a few scenes at the end that the limits of believability are sorely tested and many a cynic may not like this movie. It is however, very sweetly done. Drew Barymore is perfect as the bumbling yet lovely Josie-she breathes a breath of fresh air into the character and makes her appear perfectly realistic. I also enjoyed Leelee Sobiesky as the intellectual student who befriends Josie on her first day at the school.Never been kissed has some really funny moments as Josie unravels in her frantic efforts to be cool. Example-the reggae bar scene.I also loved the appearance of Josie's brother Rob who also goes back and signs up as a high school student, the way that he helps to give Josie her dream of finally fitting in is just hilarious. At the same time, as Josie's woeful story of her original years in high school are shown in flashback it is extremely painful.

Never been kissed becomes very much a romantic pic as Josie develops feelings for a certain man and the question becomes will they get together.I liked this movie. It was really beautifully done in some areas. The movie is corny in some places yes, the last scene-realistic-no way-does this movie manipulate your emotions in the most obvious Hollywood way? Oh yeah yeah yeah baby! But it manipulates beautifully, there are some lessons to be learned here. The movie never preaches but manages to paint an accurate picture of what high school was like for a select few. I have actually met people who have had similar experiences to Josie-I've met people very much like all these characters-I think a lot of people simply don't know or can't conceive of the cruelty that can exist in the world of high school, and how hurtful it can be, but it's there. Not unrealistic at all. What struck me was Drew's speech at the prom, as she demonstrates the sheep mentality that can exist so prevalently -as Hollywood and manufactured as many think that may be, it was well done and very true. I'm making never been kissed sound a lot heavier then it is, in truth this is a perfect movie to pick when one wants a sweet feel good light heartwarming picture.

It was really beautifully done in some areas. The movie is corny in some places yes, the last scene-realistic-no way-does this movie manipulate your emotions in the most obvious Hollywood way? Oh yeah yeah yeah baby! But it manipulates beautifully, there are some lessons to be learned here. The movie never preaches but manages to paint an accurate picture of what high school was like for a select few. I have actually met people who have had similar experiences to Josie-I've met people very much like all these characters-I think a lot of people simply don't know or can't conceive of the cruelty that can exist in the world of high school, and how hurtful it can be, but it's there. Not unrealistic at all. What struck me was Drew's speech at the prom, as she demonstrates the sheep mentality that can exist so prevalently -as Hollywood and manufactured as many think that may be, it was well done and very true. I'm making never been kissed sound a lot heavier then it is, in truth this is a perfect movie to pick when one wants a sweet feel good light heartwarming picture. It's engaging, sweetly acted and just Rufus. I'd say check it out. 8 of 10.

I watched this for at least the umpteenth time last night - maybe once a year every year since I taped it off TV in 1987. Did it let me down? It hasn't yet and I don't think it ever will I was as captivated by it as I was the first time, and yet it portrays a world, its people and their actions I'll never know, and probably wouldn't want to know either. Some people I know can't watch any film or TV programme a second time and are puzzled when I can - but then could listen with pleasure to a piece of music for a thousandth time.Lubitsch's peerless masterpiece about two crooks (Gaston and Lily) moving amongst high society, falling in love with each other, with high society and with high society in the attractive shape of rich businesswoman Madame Colet falling in love with Gaston is a witty, charming, sophisticated, erudite, relentless, sparkling etc comedy that by the finish has had the effect of defragmenting my mind and deleting the real world for a short while - no mean feat! Every second of every scene carries it's witticisms, not a moment is wasted from the dignified opening with the title song fading into the rubbish boat on the Grand Canal in Venice to the swift orgasmic climax in the taxi in Paris. At the beginning when the stricken Monsieur Philiba rises and falls to the floor of his hotel room again and the Neapolitan music lulls you across a cheesy model set to where the smoking Gaston is urbanely discussing cocktails with a waiter you should know you are in for something special. Ultra demure Kay Francis gets to says Divine twice in a row! Even looking at nothing but a clock for a minute carries a soundtrack bulging with wit and innuendo. Something as unimportant as Herbert Marshall apparently running up and down Kay Francis's stairs (on camera, in mirrors or in sound only) turns out to be an in-joke - he had only one leg. Other running gags make you smile after the film has long finished, such as Positively Tonsils and No Potatoes. And to think about this film even years later it's always with the lilting, insistent, mocking romantic background music! But I could go on and on, there's enough in this for 10 films of today to borrow if they could make them like this any more. Frasier on TV has been the closest in sophisticated comedy in recent times, but even so it couldn't match TIP's compact inventiveness. Out of the 97 million movies I've watched this is definitely in my top 5 favourites.It's a pity that so many people can so easily be put off by black and white photography and bygone stars who they've never heard of; in this case what they're missing out on is near perfection, and again another film that will still be available when all of the undisciplined uncensored in-your-face films of today are forgotten.

This isn't a review, it's a comment. I believe this movie to appeal to some, and the rest of you close-minded, uptights that can't take a joke, well, that's your right.  ","genre":"Crime, Drama"}]
