And who doesn't want to go back and impress all the people that made your life miserable back then?  This movie is about that exact feeling, and approaches it from a great angle.  It manages to accurately portray what high school was like for the rest of us, none of that Varsity Blues crap, or the sappy ludicrousness that was Can't Hardly Wait.  The film even manages to make Mira Sorvino and Lisa Kudrow (virtual goddesses) believable as teenaged losers.  Kudrow, though a brilliant actress as proven in The Opposite of Sex and Analyze This, still seems to be playing Phoebe from Friends in this role.  She is still funny, and delightful all around, but Phoebe all the same.  It is Sorvino that reinvents ditz.  She won an Oscar for everyone's favorite hooker, Linda Ash in Mighty Aphrodite, but she chooses a completely different but still ditzy route with Romy White.  Sorvino wields her talent better than her character wields a hairspray can.  It takes a brilliant woman to play a ditz, and an even more brilliant woman to discover facets within the role of the ditz.  Sorvino accomplished just that.  She also has a faking it scene that gives Meg Ryan in When Harry Met Sally a run for its money.  The supporting cast is wonderful as well.  Emmy winner Cameron Manheim appears as the perky, big-boned, well-meaning, and terribly annoying Toby.  Every class had one, and Manheim has it down.  Then there was the most noteworthy supporting cast member, Janeane Garofalo.  This is a quintessential Garofalo role, sarcastic, sardonic, cynical, and downright hilarious.  She utters truisms, most of us have only thought but never dared say.  The movie was great fun, and whoever played Billy is great eye-candy in his high school years.

I went into it with the only expectation I felt was reasonable.  The beginning of the story.  That's all. Nothing more was necessary.  We knew the future of the story, but we needed the starting point.  That is what George Lucas gave us.  Now I know a lot of you out there have some gripes, so let's examine a few.Let's start with the biggest  Jar Jar!  Most everyone who had a gripe, had the biggest one with this character.  Let's face it, every movie has to have a catch for every generation.  While he was definitely my least favorite part of the movie, I realized his importance.  If you accept Jar Jar for what he is, you can successfully look beyond him and not let him drag the movie down.  90% of the big movies that come out now a days appeal to all audiences.  If you get all ages, you make more money.  Jar Jar was there for the kids and comic relief.  Not all that necessary, but he was there and that's that.  Deal with it.The other big gripe I have heard is how quickly the movie moved along and the lack of character development due to it.  Did anybody out there see the movie Star Wars?!?  This movie was no different.  This movie, like episode IV, is meant to set us up for more character developement.  Introduce the main players and then get into more detail in the next installment.  The main point was to give the story of how everything came about.  People p***ed and moaned about the movie being about a trade war.  If those people had paid more attention in the first trilogy, they would have realized that Senator Palpatine is the Emperor and this is how he got to power.  This Trade War is the begining of the Empire. I'd say that's a pretty important detail.And finally, not enough Darth Maul.  Well, I wanted more of the dueling as well, but what we did get was pretty awesome.  You forget that we didn't get super long lightsaber duels in the other movies.  There was always more to the story, so why would they change that now.  Personally, if they kept a duel going to long, it would start to resemble a car chase that went on too long.  Short and sweet.  Worked for me.I thought this movie was a triumph and a great beginning to the saga.  I think that most of you out there need to ignore the hype as much as possible, and stop being so critical.

But Brad Gorton does a marvelous job of showing John's fears (which are legitimate) and his conflicted feelings. (Plus, he keeps the teary confession scene from becoming maudlin; in the theater, it felt like the audience members were on the edge of our seats, even though we all knew where the scene was headed.) And Charlotte Brittain as Linda is hilarious (luckily, she gets her own storyline, although unfortunately, it's not nearly large enough).Also, as someone who's used to seeing high school sophomores played by 24-year-olds, it was very refreshing to see a film where the teenagers were played by teenagers.

I thought I had the whole movie thing pretty much figured out, and I went in to see The Blair Witch Project thinking, yeah....just another quickie filmed to cash in on the success of Scream.What I saw defied and challenged everything I have ever known about filmmaking, and quite frankly, it's sending me back to the books to try to figure out just how the heck they managed to pull it off.This is indeed the scariest, creepiest movie that has ever come out of Hollywood....EVER. Scarier than Night of the Living Dead. Scarier than Scream. Scarier than anything. You name it, I've seen most of them. And they don't hold a candle to this one.The reason is, there's no monster. No real emphasis of supernatural events. Just three college students trapped in the woods, in a battle with unseen supernatural forces and nature. This alone would have set the stages for a good movie, kind of an interesting play on paranioa. But it takes it a level higher....or maybe a level lower. It's filmed like a documentory, with a camcorder that shakes and moves the whole time. And that leaves it all absolutely nervewracking.Here's the premise, and it's pretty simple three college students are out to film a documentory about the Blair Witch, an Urban Legend from the woods of Maryland. But upon a closer examination, they get lost in the woods, and it's basically an account of their struggle, from fleeing from ghostly apparitions in the night to battling with each other. And it's all filmed on a camcorder, and presented like one would present a family vacation that they taped themselves. It's not even in widescreen format....just plain camcorder.Therefore, it's all realistic, and you question whether or not it is false or ACTUAL footage, due to the authenticity. I was in a cold sweat fifteen minutes into it, and but the terrifying closing scene, I was losing my nerve and trembling violently. Only one other film has come close to having this affect on me....the original Candyman....but it doesn't come anywhere close to this. I knew that film was made up....But this....this challenged fiction and you are absolutely convinced it is real. Kevin Williamson, hate to say it, but you've suddenly been booted into second place by a handful of unprofessionals!What also helps its realism is the fact that the actors are so great. Most horror movies nowadays have great looking leading teenage actors getting slashed, but this one features normal looking people in terrifying situations. How affective are they? Believe me when I say that Oscar nominations WILL arise.... The character of Heather (an actress playing herself, like her co-stars) has a scene in which she apologizes to the camera for getting her friends into this whole mess. She knows she will die soon, and she is trembling with fear....and it is the finest performance I have ever seen in a horror movie....ever.Filmed with almost no budget (a budget would have taken away from it), it is choppy and a mess....just like a camcorder recording always is....and that just helps the situation. And this only enhanced the true affect of the film. No film has ever scared me as terribly as this movie.... Go see it only if you think you're strong enough to handle it. Not for the intense gore (there is none), but for the true suspence. This is indeed a horror film that challenges the idea that horror movies need gore, and I totally respect that.

Michael Williams and Josh Leonard did a great job in portraying their frustration and fear, but Heather....well, let's just say her personality is that of an actress, and when you're trying to see her as just a scared girl lost in the woods, her personality gets in the way.  In the beginning of the film when they're interviewing locals, Heather makes it painfully obvious that the interviews are scripted when she prods the people with questions so that they stick to the story.  In some cases, Heather would ask a question containing all the details the interviewee was supposed to reveal, and that person would be left just to answer yes or no.  They shouldn't have told her what the people were going to say during the interviews.  (And I must agree with something a previous commentator said do not let Heather do any more publicity.  I saw her on Leno the other night and wanted to smack her.)Small spoilers next!Third, because there's so much out there about this movie--web sites, reviews, articles, etc. about how the movie was made, people aren't going to go into it without knowing that everything the three filmmakers encounter is pre-planned by the directors.  I envy those who got to screen the film at Sundance, before the hype got started--they must have truly been scared out of their wits.

I realize there wouldn't have a been a film at all without this footage, but I also realize that a 16mm camera is not light, and no one running for their lives would've picked that thing up and ran with it.

It's filled to the rim with hard core, high octane tension and suspense-so much that it is almost hard to catch your breath throughout the movie's running period.  Fueled with first rate performances and a script that is understandable and clear, this may be one of the best thrillers. The movie starts off with a boy, named Brady Lang, who stumbles down Arlington Rd. with blood dripping from his body. Jeff Bridges, who plays Michael Faraday, a single professor who teachers a course on terrorism at a local university, observes this terrified and injured child from inside his car as he drives by. After realizing the nature of his wounds, he dashes out of his car to help. Michael rushes Brady to the nearest hospital, in result he saves his life and meets some people whom he will soon wish he would have never laid eyes on. Wow. What an exhilarating opening scene. While it may be a little over the top, it does provide the setup needed for such the brutal, bloodthirsty film this really is. It is not a film for younger viewers, and I would check into it some more if you're faint of heart or squeamish in any way. This movie takes itself seriously for every second of the way, unlike many other scary movies out there today.Brady Lang belongs to a new family down the block from the Faraday's, consisting of Oliver, the friendly dad, Cheryl, almost eccentric wife, and their children, who are very bizarre acting. Quiet and suspicious, almost as if they are holding something back.  When Michael and his girlfriend, Brooke, meet the Lang's, they introduce them to his son, ask them over for dinner sometime, and look around their new house. Oliver is an architect currently working on a shopping mall somewhere out of town. But wait! When Michael was over there last he saw the blueprint to his so called mall, and knows that this is no mall he his constructing. This makes Michael very wearily of his neighbors, especially when he beholds Oliver's mail and discovers that there may have been a name change sometime ago in Lang's past. He brings these things to the attention to Brooke, only to have her call him paranoid and that his occupation is getting to his head. That is also what his old buddy, FBI Agent Whit Carver, says to him when Michael asks him to do a background check on Oliver.Things really heat up when Michael discovers the truth behind his friendly neighbor's secret identity. Movie posters and newspaper ads suggest it. Previews and reviews reveal it, and by the time the film takes an unexpected turn in the third act, the only one suspecting Oliver Lang to be just an ordinary person is Michael. Arlington Road is smart enough to develop Jeff Bridge's character with feelings, flashbacks and an emotional past, rather than showing us the details of his past marriage. It is also smart enough not to develop a romantic subplot between Michael and Brooke, beyond the suggestions and interest in each other. It stays on track every inch of the way; all the scenes further the plot a little bit at a time. Leading us with a perfectly structured, flawlessly planned out thriller. The performance by Jeff Bridges is so great and certainly Oscar worthy we actually buy into the paranoia plot and end up caring about him so much this movie's ending actually hurts to watch. It ruins the entire production. The last twenty minutes of this movie arrant just unbelievable, but the closing scene features a sense of injustice, unfairness, and is unsettling beyond comprehension. All of this and I still have not revealed the actually end to you, and will not. But I hated it, and think the majority of an audience will join me in saying as the closing credits arouse on screen their jaw dropped off their face and hit the floor.\tHowever, I do think the film is unconventional because of the thematic structure it used for its closing and subject madder. If it would have concluded in a predictable, usual fashioned people would complain about that too. It proves how much we care about the characters. And at the same time allows us to realize that this film deserved better, somewhere down the road, it deserved to be much better.
