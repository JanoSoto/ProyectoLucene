There was another part of the film I remember seeing some years later (the part where the Dr. Terminus character manages to win over the initially angry people), but I didn't know what movie I was seeing. After many years, I could still remember the title of this mostly live action Disney film (but one with a cartoon dragon), and finally decided to watch it from start to finish this week. It's far from one of the most highly regarded Disney productions in the long history of the company, and I wasn't expecting it to be among the great ones, but I was expecting it to be better than I found it to be, which is not good at all for the most part.With the help of his magical dragon, Elliott, a young orphaned boy named Pete manages to escape from his cruel adoptive family, the Gogans, but they are still determined to find him somehow or other. The boy and his dragon friend travel together and soon come to a village called Passamaquoddy. Before they enter, Pete tells Elliott that he must make himself invisible (a magical power of his) in order to avoid scaring the people, so the dragon reluctantly does so, but even in his invisible form, he soon causes a lot of trouble in the village, and since nobody can see him, it looks like Pete is responsible! After Pete gets away from an angry mob and Elliott scares Lampie, the drunken lighthouse keeper, the two of them go to a cave near the lighthouse, where Nora, Lampie's daughter, finds Pete and decides to give him shelter in her home. He often talks to her about Elliott, and she doesn't believe that this dragon actually exists, but plays along. Unfortunately, the dragon continues to cause trouble for Pete, and the village of Passamaquoddy has another problem when medicine showman Dr. Terminus and his assistant, Hoagy, are back to swindle the villagers again with their fraudulent formulas! This live action\/animation crossover is a musical, and unfortunately, the songs generally don't have much effect. I think this already shows with the first song, sung by the Gogans as they pursue Pete, but it gets worse after the boy and his dragon friend get away from them and we hear the next musical number, Boo Bop Bopbop Bop (I Love You, Too). During this song, I felt like I was watching something strictly for the very young. Basically, the rest of the songs also fail, including the I Saw a Dragon one featured in the part where Lampie tells the people in the tavern what he saw, a notably clumsy segment of the film. The musical numbers are only one of the significant flaws in the film. Most of the cast performances failed to impress me, especially Jane Kean overacting in the role of Miss Taylor, the strict teacher of the village. It doesn't seem that Sean Marshall, who plays the title character, was a very good child actor. Pete's Dragon does have some pretty funny parts, but not enough to make it really work as a comedy, either. Also, while I certainly didn't find myself not caring what happened to any of the characters, I still didn't find most of the story too entertaining for some reason, but that might have been largely because of the other problems.This is a mainly live action family musical, and maybe I'm not usually into movies like this, but that hasn't stopped me from finding Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory, a live action family musical from six years before this one, to be a great film, so it's definitely not like Pete's Dragon would look bad to me regardless of quality. This particular Disney piece came out the same year as The Rescuers, an all animated feature which disappointed me when I first saw it last year (I actually found its 1990 sequel, The Rescuers Down Under, to be much better, as rare as that is with sequels and as much as many Disney fans would probably disagree), but even that film I found to be better than this very lacklustre live action\/animation crossover. I gave Pete's Dragon a try, and realize that it has a following (not a huge one, but it is a following), but simply put, I just didn't like it. I guess I can still recommend it for kids and won't say adults should avoid it at all costs, but I also still think there are good reasons for all the criticism.

It's far from one of the most highly regarded Disney productions in the long history of the company, and I wasn't expecting it to be among the great ones, but I was expecting it to be better than I found it to be, which is not good at all for the most part.With the help of his magical dragon, Elliott, a young orphaned boy named Pete manages to escape from his cruel adoptive family, the Gogans, but they are still determined to find him somehow or other. The boy and his dragon friend travel together and soon come to a village called Passamaquoddy. Before they enter, Pete tells Elliott that he must make himself invisible (a magical power of his) in order to avoid scaring the people, so the dragon reluctantly does so, but even in his invisible form, he soon causes a lot of trouble in the village, and since nobody can see him, it looks like Pete is responsible! After Pete gets away from an angry mob and Elliott scares Lampie, the drunken lighthouse keeper, the two of them go to a cave near the lighthouse, where Nora, Lampie's daughter, finds Pete and decides to give him shelter in her home. He often talks to her about Elliott, and she doesn't believe that this dragon actually exists, but plays along. Unfortunately, the dragon continues to cause trouble for Pete, and the village of Passamaquoddy has another problem when medicine showman Dr. Terminus and his assistant, Hoagy, are back to swindle the villagers again with their fraudulent formulas! This live action\/animation crossover is a musical, and unfortunately, the songs generally don't have much effect. I think this already shows with the first song, sung by the Gogans as they pursue Pete, but it gets worse after the boy and his dragon friend get away from them and we hear the next musical number, Boo Bop Bopbop Bop (I Love You, Too). During this song, I felt like I was watching something strictly for the very young. Basically, the rest of the songs also fail, including the I Saw a Dragon one featured in the part where Lampie tells the people in the tavern what he saw, a notably clumsy segment of the film. The musical numbers are only one of the significant flaws in the film. Most of the cast performances failed to impress me, especially Jane Kean overacting in the role of Miss Taylor, the strict teacher of the village. It doesn't seem that Sean Marshall, who plays the title character, was a very good child actor. Pete's Dragon does have some pretty funny parts, but not enough to make it really work as a comedy, either. Also, while I certainly didn't find myself not caring what happened to any of the characters, I still didn't find most of the story too entertaining for some reason, but that might have been largely because of the other problems.This is a mainly live action family musical, and maybe I'm not usually into movies like this, but that hasn't stopped me from finding Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory, a live action family musical from six years before this one, to be a great film, so it's definitely not like Pete's Dragon would look bad to me regardless of quality. This particular Disney piece came out the same year as The Rescuers, an all animated feature which disappointed me when I first saw it last year (I actually found its 1990 sequel, The Rescuers Down Under, to be much better, as rare as that is with sequels and as much as many Disney fans would probably disagree), but even that film I found to be better than this very lacklustre live action\/animation crossover. I gave Pete's Dragon a try, and realize that it has a following (not a huge one, but it is a following), but simply put, I just didn't like it. I guess I can still recommend it for kids and won't say adults should avoid it at all costs, but I also still think there are good reasons for all the criticism.

The Little Mermaid is not my favorite Disney film. Sure, the animation is great and there are a few good songs in there, but that's all I have to say that is good about this film. Before you harp on me saying But Disney sells smiles and had to give this story a happy ending compared to the original tragic story, that is not the reason why I don't like this film. I think giving stories like The Little Mermaid a happy ending is hard to pull off, but it can be done. Just too bad the execution and lack of morals made this film hard to swallow.The big beef I have with this film is the protagonist. Seriously, I really cannot stand Ariel. She's so much like Bella Swan from Twilight, that it's sickening. Ariel is superficial, spoiled, self centered, whiny, ungrateful and well, she's just about as smart as a door knob. Her dream is to have legs, but why? Because, having legs is cool and awesome and the new trend among mermaids. I know this is a family film, but that is not an excuse for cop out writing. If Disney gave her a more heartfelt reason why she wanted to be human, I would have liked this film some more. As for Ariel being superficial, the only reason why she loves Eric is because he's handsome and a prince. Never mind that he's lazy, self-centered, vain, cocky, egotistical and downright idiotic, he's handsome, rich and famous, and that's all that matters. She even goes as far as giving everything up in life, so she can stalk him and be possessive of him, to the point where she throws a tizzy when he looks at people other than her. You know, if I were Eric, I wouldn't care if she lost her voice. I would ditch her if I were him. Partners who force themselves on you and get possessive of you aren't the good type of lovers. I don't care what Disney has to say about that.As for Ariel being spoiled and ungrateful, she's rude to her family and friends, and treats her own family like a pile of garbage, yet her family and friends love her back. But she's a teenager isn't a valid excuse. Even teenagers who treat their family and friends like trash end up facing some punishment for their actions and mistakes. Hell, if I acted anything like Ariel to my family, they would have disowned me and send me to live on the streets. Well, Triton does try to punish her, but he regrets it later and lets her live out her wet fantasy of having a lazy and useless trophy husband.Ariel's not being smart for selling her soul...I mean voice to the so-called evil sea witch Ursula. And why does she want this? Because her cruel family won't let her have a trophy husband from another world. Give me a break... So to make the long story short, Ariel gets her wish, but then, Ursula makes herself pretty and seduces Eric. Instead of getting over it, Ariel gets possessive of Eric and stalls the wedding. But as she gains her voice, she becomes a mermaid and Ursula tries to turn her into a barnacle. But instead, Triton takes her place and a big battle ensures. Eric gets to do all the work while Ariel just cowers in a corner whimpering and crying. How sexist is that? I can see if this movie was made back in the 1940's, I'd be more understanding, but it was made in 1989. The same era She-Ra, Jem and other girl heroes came out. There's no excuse for Ariel to be a doormat. So in the end, Ariel doesn't apologize to her family and friends, but they still give into her dream and she gets married right off the bat. They don't talk to her saying that she needs to know him better, because that would make sense. So Ariel gets married to Eric and has a child with him, at the age of 16! And he's an adult! No, that's not pedophilia at all. In a nutshell, I can't believe this movie beat All Dogs go to Heaven and Little Nemo in the animation war of the 1980's. A film about a creepy, unhealthy and borderline dysfunctional relationship beating a couple cute, yet dark films about redeeming yourself (All Dogs go to Heaven) and conquering your fears (Little Nemo). The parental watchdog groups boycotted all Dogs and Little Nemo for being too dark and creepy, yet don't bat an eyelash to the diseased values in TLM?Watch Little Nemo, All Dogs go to Heaven and The Dark Crystal to see what real family films are about.

You know this is going to be a serious film (Lorraine Bracco of The Sopranos is in it) and at the same time, you know you're going to laugh at it (Penn Jillete of Vegas' Penn and Teller duo is also in it); except, I don't know what to say or how you should feel about singer Marc Anthony, who randomly plays a government agent in this movie. The truth is, you pretty much know what you're going to get with director Iain Softly (K-PAX, The Skeleton Key, and Inkheart) and writer Rafael Moreu of The Rage Carrie 2.My only beef with the film is that several characters randomly disappear towards the middle of the movie and never comeback. Other than that, I loved it, and so will you. It makes me wonder, what do you think Dade and his crew would do is WikiLeaks and Facebook existed back in 1995? The movie might have been called The Social Network. (LOL)Watch this movie; you will not be disappointed. It is a great flick and certainly deserving of your time.

But it's hardly the only movie of the sorts (Titanic, I am looking at you). It's also hardly the only one that tries to mix overly sentimental romance story with real life historical events. So, what went wrong here? First of all, it's too long, and it focuses on way too many things, which in turn makes the film lose its point. The bombing of Pearl Harbor is hardly the central theme of the film, and it's a huge mistake. Because of the need to end the movie with victorious note for the US, the film continues long after the Pearl Harbor attack, telling us, completely unnecessary and out of the place, another story, of the Doolittle Raid. The film completely loses its pace and coherence. Cheesy dialogues and uninspiring love triangle don't help, nor does the fact the plot is completely predictable 20 minutes into the film.The cast does its best with the lines given, but the acting is wooden and forced. Supporting characters prove to be more interesting than the main trio. Kate Beckinsale's Evelyn seems bland and without any personality. Ben Affleck's Rafe is cocky and egoistic, not at all a noble hero he's supposed to be. Josh Hartnett seems completely confused as Danny and you can just feel he doesn't want to be there. In a way, it works for his character, and he almost makes us believe he's this shy farm boy who doesn't know how to ask a girl out on a date. In a way, he proves to be one of the few things that draw people - teenage, female people - to this film.Is it the worst movie in history? Hardly.

When I was ten, I decided I was going to go watch Star Wars one day, and now I'm in love. Sure the movies are long, but I do not understand how they're uninteresting. Anyone could fall asleep while watching it-- I have before-- but that can happen to ANYONE. Anyways, this movie starts a story about great perseverance. Luke keeps working on trying to be a Jedi, save his friends, and help the rebels triumph over the Empire.I'm also going to rant about others who slam Star Wars. Maybe the effects are cheesy, but look at the time era. I've seen effects ten times cheesier in movies made in the 2000's than this. Yes, it's not real, you can tell, but it's not bad for '77. It's pretty convincable, actually, after you get past the whole science-fiction\/space theme.As for the space opera, I love it. This, of course, is only the beginning. I might be reviewing the whole original trilogy, but I love how Lucas started Leia and Han so spiteful towards each other and then blossomed that into love. That is my favorite relationship of all times. 3 People are slamming John Williams for music. First of all, I own the soundtracks to Episode IV, V, and VI, and I say it is excellent, along with critics. It totally suits the movie. People are also complaining about Lucas blasting the Imperial March every time Vader comes on the screen. I noticed that, but that was in Episode V, when that song was actually invented. It might've had a brief part of it in IV because it was new, but it didn't REALLY come around until V.It's very addicting, and I applaud Ford's acting the best. This movie is what started my love for him. He did an awesome job bringing Han Solo's personality to life, and he's the reason Solo is one of the characters I wish were real.That's about it for now. Star Wars is a great movie that will never EVER be forgotten nor lose fans.

Into this unlikely spot comes Patricia Neal--a lady with a radio show who is looking to find some singers for her program. While this idea makes no sense, it is how the film starts--suspend your disbelief and just watch. When Griffith gets on tape, however, he immediately changes--exploding into a dynamic personality. he clearly does not mind being on tape or on TV and soon he's parlayed this one event into a gig as a TV personality. And, as if by magic, his show becomes more and more and more popular--and he becomes much more powerful. It's also clear that this 'Lonesome' Rhodes (Griffith) is sociopath--a guy who knows how to play people and will say and do anything to get ahead. Now, it looks like they've created a monster--especially when those around him see the real man behind this image--a man who is potentially very dangerous and self-serving.It is ironic Griffith became famous for this role AND his Will Stockdale from the TV, Broadway and movie versions of No Time for Sergeants as they are almost complete opposites. Stockdale was sweet and innocent--Rhodes was anything but! Yet together, both roles made him a star--leading, of course, to The Andy Griffith Show and much more.Now as far as his character in A Face in the Crowd goes, I realize it's considered a brilliant characterization, but I was a bit less impressed than some critics. He's good but also awfully florid--and far from subtle. In fact, that is my biggest complaint about the film. A somewhat more subtle characterization would make this a more timeless movie--today it seems a tad over-wrought. In other words, have the rottenness of his true character be a little less apparent early on--but it's painfully obvious he's a jerk from almost the beginning. Now this is NOT saying it's a bad film--it's very good. I just might have liked it more if it had given us a tiny bit less. Interestingly, the rest of the folks in the film (such as Neal, Walter Mathau and others) were all very believable and well-directed. I am sure this was done to show the contrast between them and Rhodes--but it also made the film seem more like a parody or burlesque than it should have been. Of course, the film is considered by many to be a classic--so what do I know! By the way, if you like this film, two lesser-known but wonderful films with similar themes are well worth seeing. The far more subtle The Great Man with José Ferrer is a terrific movie as is George Sanders' Death of a Scoundrel. While less famous, I actually preferred these two films--especially The Great Man. All three films appear to have been influenced by the real-life disintegration of the folksy Arthur Godfrey, as TV audiences across America witnessed just how sweet and homespun this host really was--as bits and pieces of an underlying jerk came seeping out during this very popular show.

It's crazy how Stephen King, the master of horror novels has had many great screen adaptations, but his 2 best were prison based flicks, Shawshank Redemption and the Green Mile .. with the same Director I might add! How come they just don't make these great movies anymore? The 1990's was a great decade for movies! Silence of the Lambs, Braveheart, Shawshank Redemption, Green Mile, Titanic, Jurassic Park, Shindler's List, all in my top 10 of all time! The past decade has been crap in comparison! Again, The Green Mile ... a great movie!

These quirky little adventures were kind of fun in their own way; exuberant, brightly coloured and very, very silly. I recall one episode which cliffhangered with Batman about to be sewn into a mattress. And of course, that Batman was clearly very insecure about his own identity, because he felt the need to give everything he owned the bat- prefix &#x96; batguns, batmasks, batmats and so forth. That was the Batman of the 60s. Enter the Batman of the next generation.The thing that first strikes first about this version of the comic adventure is how dark it is &#x96; literally. Production designers Anton Furst and Peter Young have really put the goth in Gotham City, creating trashy neo-noir streets and cavernous halls filled with steam and searchlights. The cyberpunk look was very much a staple of 80s action movies, but the mould for Batman is a little different. Taking in the 1950s-style newsroom or the daisywheel printout in the chemical plant, this looks more like the Terry Gilliam film Brazil than it does The Terminator. Director Tim Burton may not have contributed quite so much to the design of this picture as he normally does, but his unique handling of space is key to the overall effect. He often shows characters dwarfed within the sets, or throws in close-ups of props in action, giving every environment a life of its own.Then there is the character of Batman himself, as re-imagined by screenwriters Sam Hamm and Warren Skaaren. Notably they ditch the flamboyantly-dressed sidekick Robin, and aim to inject some humanity and realism into the caped crusader without making him boring. The focus is very much on the hero's dual lives as Batman and Bruce Wayne. The fact that this Batman not only keeps his alter-ego a secret from those who know him as Wayne, but seems almost ashamed about it is an incredibly sympathetic touch, and his inability to be a completely whole man for the woman in his life makes him a rather tragic figure. Of course, this isn't just a psychological study, it is at heart an action movie, but the depth and complexity with which the character is endowed make the fast-paced crash-bang business end all that much more satisfying. This Batman isn't just some unbeatable physical force, he's a human being struggling with his flaws just like the rest of us.And appropriately enough lead man Michael Keaton is not some strapping, strong-jawed action star. To cast a very average-looking guy of course makes the Batman persona more logical, because rather than use his physical strength Batman relies on machines, gadgets and his own intelligence. Keaton is best known for his semi-improvised comedy parts, but here he plays it straight, giving us a thoughtful, businesslike hero, open to his emotions and very much in the spirit of this adaptation. Keaton's restraint and naturalism is in complete contrast to his nemesis, Jack Nicholson's Joker. Although he has given some very good straight performances Nicholson is basically a big ham at heart, and he really knows how to go to town on a role like this. He is obviously just enjoying himself, improvising little flourishes and playing out his lines for all their worth (e.g. brand Xssssssssssssss). He provides a daffy counterpoint to what is sometimes a very serious take on the superhero movie.And yes, it is only sometimes that this version of Batman is serious. It may be dark, brooding and psychologically deep, but it's also a cornucopia of oddball ideas &#x96; green gas, horrific plastic surgery, not to mention the final fight scene choreographed to a playful waltz. It makes the whole thing very watchable, compensating for the fact that the action isn't up to the high standards of the decade by simply throwing in something demented every five minutes to keep things interesting.

The epic is clearly too big for the silver screen without massive cuts, but the film tries to have it's cake and eat it too- preserving the irresponsibly large scope of the source material without compromise. It came at the cost of the story. Perhaps a thorough knowledge of the source material makes this film brilliant, as die-hard fans seem to claim.

I'm sure fans of the novel will probably think I've missed the point of it all, and they're right- by the end (which wasn't too bad, all up), I was left with many more questions than answers. But with all the issues it had, I'm sure there's a good story in there somewhere, and I may just take up the book to read it. The epic is clearly too big for the silver screen without massive cuts, but the film tries to have it's cake and eat it too- preserving the irresponsibly large scope of the source material without compromise. It came at the cost of the story. Perhaps a thorough knowledge of the source material makes this film brilliant, as die-hard fans seem to claim. For the rest of us, Dune the film is much like Dune the planet- huge, bland and inhospitable to outsiders.

If it is critical, make sure it's clearly woven into the narrative before making them important. The mannerisms of the Harkonnen, the Mentats, those strange psychic women, the Sadukar, and innumerable other things the film were supposedly important but the direction and narrative totally failed to explain their significance. Being unable to understand the setting of the universe made it difficult to become engaged.The next huge issue with the film is a lack of motivation. The overarching plot has something to do with a prophecy and Paul's role as some sort of messiah figure to the natives of Arrakis but it seems to come at a cost to his character.
