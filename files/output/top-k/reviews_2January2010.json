[{"date":"2 January 2010","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Magnolia is an interesting oddity. It is one of the few films I've see that I liked enough throughout that I was willing to more-or-less forgive the way it fell apart at the end.The movie tells the stories of a bunch of loosely-connected people, including a dying man, an ex-whiz kid, a current whiz kid and a master of seduction. These people are intriguing, rich, full, multi-layered characters, and their stories are told with subtlety and intelligence.Performances are excellent, especially Tom Cruise as the professional pick up artist. I actually watched the movie after seeing a couple of outtakes on Youtube of Cruise leading a seminar (these are quite funny, and represent a case in which a lot of the best bits of the movie wound up on the cutting room floor, perhaps justifiably, as they could have overwhelmed the movie as a whole).Unfortunately, P.T. Anderson apparently didn't feel all that was enough. He begins a movie with a series of anecdotes about coincidence, leading viewers to assume that the movie will end with something that connects these threads, but instead the movie just drifts towards the end, with an poorly conceived musical number and an ending that is in no way properly set up by the beginning, or by anything else in the movie.And yet, over all I found this pretty entertaining. It could have been a great movie - I think a script doctor probably could have turned the script as it was filmed into a great movie pretty easily - but it is still quite enjoyable throughout, in spite of vagaries in tone and some real huh? moments.
