Nichol's smooth direction (which he won an Oscar for) and the all round perfect performances by an excellent cast (including Dustin Hoffman in his first big role, Anne Bancroft and Katharine Ross) make The Graduate an unforgettable and emotional experience.The film follows Benjamin Braddock (Dustin Hoffman), who we first see returning home from college to a party(celebrating his scholarship) held by his upper-class parents. There he meets Mrs. Robinson (Anne Bancroft) and they spark up an affair which lasts all summer long, that is, until Elaine Robinson (Katharine Ross) returns from college. Mr and Mrs. Braddock, and Mr. Robinson (Murray Hamilton) are both pushing Ben to ask her out on a date, much to Mrs. Robinson's annoyance. Of course, what follows is tragedy and heartbreak.Not only is this film a gripping romantic drama, but a look at the 60's, materialism and love. Ben wants to be different, as it is obvious he feels smothered by everyone around him, congratulating him and buying his presents. Mrs. Robinson is afraid of aging, and prays on young Benjamin to feel alive again, and is afraid of her daughter, who she sees as a threat to her appearance. The characters in this film are all somewhat lost and looking for direction, and when they think they have found it they are actually far from it. Ben is lost in a world full of people worried about money, and Mrs. Robinson is afraid of aging.

First of all, there are two stories that hardly have anything to do with each other, one being about a serial killer raping and murdering collegegirls and another about a married couple and a doctor. Sorkin is a gifted writer as is evident in his work for TV but somehow the plot of 'Malice' is a bit contrived, messy and the screenplay lacks depth. The story would have been far more effective if the characters were better developed. There are plenty of twists and suspense but the surprise turns are a little out of place and it is hard to understand the motivation behind the characters' actions. For instance, why would Kidman's character allow herself to get so severely ill and risk her own life in the hands of someone else? Yet, 'Malice' is an entertaining thriller. The plot might be confusing at times but the performances are good, the dialogues are solid and it is technically well executed. The soundtrack flows well and some of the visuals are brilliant. Nicole Kidman is wonderful in spite of a poorly written character. Bill Pullman is great as the naive, passive, boring, pushover husband. Alec Baldwin, who plays Andy's counterpart is equally good. The supporting cast includes talented names life Anne Bancroft, Peter Gallagher, Gwyneth Paltrow and Bebe Neuarth but their screen time is limited.

However there were plenty before this, going back to 1929's The Love Parade, as well as the 1936 version of Showboat, the Disney features and of course the one everyone knows, The Wizard of Oz. In fact you could say that this picture is less integrated than many of those earlier musicals, as its score is cobbled together from a mix of new material and period songs &#150; few of which literally relate to the story in the way that say, Hammerstein's lyrics do.But Freed was after a different kind of integration. The exact lyrics do not really matter, it's how the placing of the song makes it part of the narrative. For example, look how the title song is used in the opening scene to introduce the family, moving from room to room and character to character, whilst simultaneously keying us into the mood of the picture. We also have The Trolley Song &#150; in itself a fairly meaningless ditty about riding a trolley and falling in love, but as the number plays out we see Judy Garland's disappointment that John Truett is not on board, followed by her rush of excitement to see him catch it at the last minute, which eventually turns to embarrassment as she doesn't know what to say to him. The Trolley Song is effectively a scene in its own right even though, apart from a few lines at the beginning, it has no dialogue. That is the Freed effect.Minnelli was perhaps the perfect director to work with Freed, and he had many of his own ideas about how a musical should be shot. In 1930s musicals, the songs were all too often shot and choreographed flatly, as if shooting a stage performance. When directors did experiment with a musical filming technique they tended to be either filling a unique niche (Busby Berkely) or they were making one-offs and never returned to the genre (James Whale in Showboat; King Vidor in the prologue of Wizard of Oz). Minnelli's approach is subtle, and yet it is so precise. In a slow song like The Boy Next Door, he just gradually changes the framing around Judy Garland as the song moves from one verse to the next, in a similar way to how Vidor filmed her singing Somewhere over the Rainbow. In a busy dance number like Skip to My Lou he keeps the camera moving in time with the music, following one dancer and then another as they take it in turns to pick up the song. The camera had not been so smoothly woven into the choreography since Busby Berkely's heyday in the early 1930s &#150; but the difference is that while Berkely's numbers were completely abstract, Minnelli's make sense as part of the scene.Perhaps the most pioneering moment in Meet Me in St Louis is his staging of Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas, which is even more restrained than The Boy Next Door. The camera does not even move, although the shot changes a few times to give us close-ups at key moments. But Minnelli makes a subtle kind of choreography out of the smallest movements &#150; Judy Garland putting down the music box, then taking off her bonnet &#150; little actions that keep the number moving visually without being jarring or intrusive.Aside from the music, Minnelli had now developed into a competent and unique filmmaker. Of most obvious note is his exquisite shot composition and use of colour, which is extra special because whereas most directors would colour co-ordinate a set or an establishing shot, Minnelli plans the colour arrangements for wherever the actors are standing or the camera is pointing at any given moment. Then there is his handling of the Halloween segment. It's the dullest part of the picture because it is the longest break without a song, but at least Minnelli gives it its own character, showing the scenario with a child's eye view, and mixing stereotyped horror atmospherics with comedy.Of course Freed and Minnelli would be nowhere without their able collaborators. Ralph Blane, who actually had a longer career as a lyricist than as a musician, captures the spirit of the era with his original compositions. Judy Garland, despite being sick of playing teenage roles, shows a developing maturity and even displays a hint of the sass and cynicism that would later become her trademark. There isn't a single bad performance amongst the supporting cast, although the most enjoyable to watch are Harry Davenport and Margaret O'Brien &#150; probably the most talented child actress of her era.Meet Me in St Louis did very little that had not been done somewhere before, but nevertheless it is a landmark musical, but it helped establish the trend for all future screen musicals. It didn't mark the beginning of the integrated musical, but it marked the end of the non-integrated musical.

","genre":"Comedy, Drama, Family"},{"date":"23 December 2008","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Meet Me in St Louis was the second pairing of producer Arthur Freed and director Vincente Minnelli, but unlike their first collaboration on Cabin in the Sky, this time both appear to have hit their stride and made a mission statement on how a screen musical should be made.Meet Me in St Louis is sometimes wrongly identified as the first integrated musical &#150; that is, a musical in which the songs are part of the story rather than distinct interludes. However there were plenty before this, going back to 1929's The Love Parade, as well as the 1936 version of Showboat, the Disney features and of course the one everyone knows, The Wizard of Oz. In fact you could say that this picture is less integrated than many of those earlier musicals, as its score is cobbled together from a mix of new material and period songs &#150; few of which literally relate to the story in the way that say, Hammerstein's lyrics do.But Freed was after a different kind of integration. The exact lyrics do not really matter, it's how the placing of the song makes it part of the narrative. For example, look how the title song is used in the opening scene to introduce the family, moving from room to room and character to character, whilst simultaneously keying us into the mood of the picture. We also have The Trolley Song &#150; in itself a fairly meaningless ditty about riding a trolley and falling in love, but as the number plays out we see Judy Garland's disappointment that John Truett is not on board, followed by her rush of excitement to see him catch it at the last minute, which eventually turns to embarrassment as she doesn't know what to say to him. The Trolley Song is effectively a scene in its own right even though, apart from a few lines at the beginning, it has no dialogue. That is the Freed effect.Minnelli was perhaps the perfect director to work with Freed, and he had many of his own ideas about how a musical should be shot. In 1930s musicals, the songs were all too often shot and choreographed flatly, as if shooting a stage performance. When directors did experiment with a musical filming technique they tended to be either filling a unique niche (Busby Berkely) or they were making one-offs and never returned to the genre (James Whale in Showboat; King Vidor in the prologue of Wizard of Oz). Minnelli's approach is subtle, and yet it is so precise. In a slow song like The Boy Next Door, he just gradually changes the framing around Judy Garland as the song moves from one verse to the next, in a similar way to how Vidor filmed her singing Somewhere over the Rainbow. In a busy dance number like Skip to My Lou he keeps the camera moving in time with the music, following one dancer and then another as they take it in turns to pick up the song. The camera had not been so smoothly woven into the choreography since Busby Berkely's heyday in the early 1930s &#150; but the difference is that while Berkely's numbers were completely abstract, Minnelli's make sense as part of the scene.Perhaps the most pioneering moment in Meet Me in St Louis is his staging of Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas, which is even more restrained than The Boy Next Door.

It's not that one is really better than the other is; they're simply two different mediums. It's that one should not suffocate the other one in the market, as they both have their own specialties and peculiarities.One of the last fully 2D hand-drawn movies made was 'Balto', out of Steven Spielberg's Amblimation Animation Studios (which then closed down forever following 'Balto''s lukewarm reception). It was a cruel twist of fate that 'Balto' was released at the same time as Pixar's groundbreaking 'Toy Story', for the latter definitely attracted all the glances and sucked Balto's steam dry. Considering all that 'Balto' is about, that's somewhat of a crime against animation in itself.But enough of the melodrama. 'Balto' is based, of course, on the true story of the real-life 1925 Serum Run to bring back antitoxin to stricken Nome, Alaska, which was overtaken by a vicious bout of diphtheria. Although the real story wasn't quite as stylized as depicted in this movie, the film certainly holds a proud candle to the real men and their dogs that risked their lives against insane odds and became heroes (even though in the end, only one dog was remembered).In the cold winter of 1925, the town of Nome is cheering their dogsled teams as they fiercely compete to win the annual race. One of the onlookers is Balto (Kevin Bacon), a wolfdog with a gentle spirit and a brave heart. However, his half-wolf status results in him being feared by the townspeople and disdained by the other pedigreed dogs (led by the cunningly malicious Steele), and he finds himself depressed and lonely most of the time. His only friends consist of an unlikely trio a flightless Russian goose named Boris (voiced by Bob Hoskins, and with an accent and mannerisms that can't help but crack you up), and two polar bear siblings, Muk and Luk (Phil Collins), who can't swim.Balto soon falls smitten with Jenna, a beautiful husky who belongs to a little girl named Rosy, who is the only human so far to be friendly to Balto. However, as the infection hits, all the children &#150; Rosy included &#150; fall dangerously ill, and the town is out of medicine. I'll let you look up the conditions on getting new antitoxin for yourself (this is a review, not a historical paper), and now Nome must send their best and fastest dogs on a dangerous race against time to retrieve the waiting serum at the town of Nenana &#150; some 700 miles away or so. The team faces deadly blizzards, treacherous ice and unpredictable climates, and soon, as can be predicted, they end up hopelessly lost. It's now up to Balto and his ragtag team of mismatched friends to battle their way through the Alaskan winter wilderness to try and bring the medicine back home, and save both the team, and the stricken children back in Nome.Being a music aficionado, the first thing that I fell in love with about this movie was James Horner's beautiful score. I would even be bold enough to state it can rival his work on 'Titanic' (1997), though I suspect many wouldn't perhaps agree. The pieces are always moving and magical, and truly bring the scenes to life in ways that couldn't have been accomplished without it.The hand-drawn animation in this movie is excellent, one of the best in many years. The winter scenery is beautiful, and the characters are all well-drawn and animated. The voice acting is largely solid (especially for Boris, for whom I've already expressed my amusement), yet some of them seem to fall a bit short. Kevin Bacon seems slightly flat as Balto, and Bridget Fonda (Jenna) seems slightly dispassionate at times.There are many things to be enjoyed concerning this film. For me, it's that while it does follow a traditional formula seen in animated family movies, it seems to leave out all the annoying bits (such as those irritating sing-along songs, for starters). There are the standard bumbling sidekicks, but they're more akin to comic relief than to actually accompanying the hero through his entire journey, and that's not to mention the humor in this film is genuinely funny and pleasant, not forced or contrived like in most animated movies.Some would be a little surprised to find some of the themes in this film are rather more grim and dark than in most other family-oriented animation films; there's a very real sense of impending mortality, especially towards the children of Nome, as demonstrated in one scene where we see several small coffins being made. In contrast, there are also some truly beautiful scenes, such as a little trick Balto teaches Jenna that leads to a mountainside being illuminated by artificial Northern Lights.If you haven't seen 'Balto' yet, do yourself (and the movie) a favor and grab it while it's still available in some areas (took me weeks to find my own DVD). Sure, it's applicable largely to younger audiences, but any adult capable of connecting with an emotion now and then will likely enjoy the movie to some extent. I for one love it and heartily recommend it to anyone who craves some good and decent 2D animation, those markets being so barren these days.* * * * * For reminding us what traditional animation was like with its magic and beauty, I award 'Balto' 8.5 bottle of antitoxin out of 10.PS &#150; Was I the only one who was surprised to learn it was Phil Collins who voiced Muk & Luk? Was I also the only one who totally failed to recognize this legendary singer's voice?

However, his half-wolf status results in him being feared by the townspeople and disdained by the other pedigreed dogs (led by the cunningly malicious Steele), and he finds himself depressed and lonely most of the time. His only friends consist of an unlikely trio a flightless Russian goose named Boris (voiced by Bob Hoskins, and with an accent and mannerisms that can't help but crack you up), and two polar bear siblings, Muk and Luk (Phil Collins), who can't swim.Balto soon falls smitten with Jenna, a beautiful husky who belongs to a little girl named Rosy, who is the only human so far to be friendly to Balto. However, as the infection hits, all the children &#150; Rosy included &#150; fall dangerously ill, and the town is out of medicine. I'll let you look up the conditions on getting new antitoxin for yourself (this is a review, not a historical paper), and now Nome must send their best and fastest dogs on a dangerous race against time to retrieve the waiting serum at the town of Nenana &#150; some 700 miles away or so. The team faces deadly blizzards, treacherous ice and unpredictable climates, and soon, as can be predicted, they end up hopelessly lost. It's now up to Balto and his ragtag team of mismatched friends to battle their way through the Alaskan winter wilderness to try and bring the medicine back home, and save both the team, and the stricken children back in Nome.Being a music aficionado, the first thing that I fell in love with about this movie was James Horner's beautiful score. I would even be bold enough to state it can rival his work on 'Titanic' (1997), though I suspect many wouldn't perhaps agree. The pieces are always moving and magical, and truly bring the scenes to life in ways that couldn't have been accomplished without it.The hand-drawn animation in this movie is excellent, one of the best in many years. The winter scenery is beautiful, and the characters are all well-drawn and animated. The voice acting is largely solid (especially for Boris, for whom I've already expressed my amusement), yet some of them seem to fall a bit short. Kevin Bacon seems slightly flat as Balto, and Bridget Fonda (Jenna) seems slightly dispassionate at times.There are many things to be enjoyed concerning this film. For me, it's that while it does follow a traditional formula seen in animated family movies, it seems to leave out all the annoying bits (such as those irritating sing-along songs, for starters). There are the standard bumbling sidekicks, but they're more akin to comic relief than to actually accompanying the hero through his entire journey, and that's not to mention the humor in this film is genuinely funny and pleasant, not forced or contrived like in most animated movies.Some would be a little surprised to find some of the themes in this film are rather more grim and dark than in most other family-oriented animation films; there's a very real sense of impending mortality, especially towards the children of Nome, as demonstrated in one scene where we see several small coffins being made. In contrast, there are also some truly beautiful scenes, such as a little trick Balto teaches Jenna that leads to a mountainside being illuminated by artificial Northern Lights.If you haven't seen 'Balto' yet, do yourself (and the movie) a favor and grab it while it's still available in some areas (took me weeks to find my own DVD). Sure, it's applicable largely to younger audiences, but any adult capable of connecting with an emotion now and then will likely enjoy the movie to some extent. I for one love it and heartily recommend it to anyone who craves some good and decent 2D animation, those markets being so barren these days.* * * * * For reminding us what traditional animation was like with its magic and beauty, I award 'Balto' 8.5 bottle of antitoxin out of 10.PS &#150; Was I the only one who was surprised to learn it was Phil Collins who voiced Muk & Luk?

It's not that one is really better than the other is; they're simply two different mediums. It's that one should not suffocate the other one in the market, as they both have their own specialties and peculiarities.One of the last fully 2D hand-drawn movies made was 'Balto', out of Steven Spielberg's Amblimation Animation Studios (which then closed down forever following 'Balto''s lukewarm reception). It was a cruel twist of fate that 'Balto' was released at the same time as Pixar's groundbreaking 'Toy Story', for the latter definitely attracted all the glances and sucked Balto's steam dry. Considering all that 'Balto' is about, that's somewhat of a crime against animation in itself.But enough of the melodrama. 'Balto' is based, of course, on the true story of the real-life 1925 Serum Run to bring back antitoxin to stricken Nome, Alaska, which was overtaken by a vicious bout of diphtheria.

It is said to be one of the few old Cornish inns not to have been used by smugglers; it is about as far from the sea as it is possible to be in Cornwall, and its exposed position on open moorland by a main road would have made it easy to detect any suspicious movements of goods. Nevertheless, its atmospheric setting appealed to the novelist Daphne Du Maurier, who used it as the backdrop to her novel Jamaica Inn, which deals with the activities of smugglers and wreckers in early nineteenth century Cornwall.Period costume drama was not really Alfred Hitchcock's forte, so he was not the most obvious choice to direct the film version of Du Maurier's novel. (According to some accounts he only did so in order to secure the rights to another of her novels, Rebecca, made into one of his most famous films the following year. A third Hitchcock film, The Birds, was also based on her work). The film is set in the 1820s. Jamaica Inn, which in the film is closer to the sea, closer to Truro and further from Bodmin than it is in reality, is the headquarters of a gang of wreckers, led by the innkeeper Joss. The wreckers conceal coastal beacons in order to cause ships to run aground. Then they loot the wrecks and kill the surviving sailors.The main character is Mary Yellan, the orphaned niece of Joss's wife Patience, who comes to stay with her aunt and uncle after the deaths of her parents, but who flees from the inn after discovering her uncle's criminal activities. In the original novel Mary was herself Cornish, but here she is made Irish, presumably to accommodate Maureen O'Hara's accent. Another change to Du Maurier's plot concerns the main villain; in the book he was a parson, but in the film he becomes the local squire, Sir Humphrey Pengallan, who is in league with the gang. He uses his powers as a magistrate to offer them legal protection in exchange for a share of their loot, which he needs in order to fund his lavish lifestyle. This change was made in order to comply with the American Production Code, which forbade unsympathetic portrayals of clergymen. Even in the thirties America was the main export market for British films, which meant that the Hays Office could exercise its influence on both sides of the Atlantic.Pengallan was played by that old ham Charles Laughton, who also acted as co-producer and insisted on rewriting the script to give his character greater prominence. Most of the blame for the failure of the film must be laid at his door as it was he, rather than Hitchcock, who had the final say on these matters. Laughton was often prone to overacting, and his performance in Jamaica Inn is one of his hammiest. The ending, rewritten to give him a dramatic death scene, is particularly melodramatic and implausible. Laughton was also responsible for the casting of O'Hara, even though Hitchcock had not wanted to use her after a poor screen test. Her performance in the film itself is a wooden one; Laughton overacts badly, but she underacts equally badly. (Surprisingly, the film was good for O'Hara's career. Laughton was, unaccountably, so taken with her performance that he invited her to play Esmeralda opposite his Quasimodo in The Hunchback of Notre Dame).The critic Michael Medved included Jamaica Inn in his Fifty Worst Movies of All Time. I suspect that Medved was being deliberately provocative; he must have realised that he could not fill his book with fifty examples of Z-movies like Santa Claus Conquers the Martians and that nominating a minor work of a major director for a golden turkey would be a good way of generating controversy. Nevertheless, the film is one of Hitchcock's weakest, lacking not only the drama and suspense we have come to associate with Hitchcock but also the touches of humour he often used to lighten the mood. (Any humour in the film is inadvertent). It is hardly surprising that Du Maurier disliked the adaptation and that Hitchcock left Britain for Hollywood as soon as possible after completing it.

Then they loot the wrecks and kill the surviving sailors.The main character is Mary Yellan, the orphaned niece of Joss's wife Patience, who comes to stay with her aunt and uncle after the deaths of her parents, but who flees from the inn after discovering her uncle's criminal activities. In the original novel Mary was herself Cornish, but here she is made Irish, presumably to accommodate Maureen O'Hara's accent. Another change to Du Maurier's plot concerns the main villain; in the book he was a parson, but in the film he becomes the local squire, Sir Humphrey Pengallan, who is in league with the gang. He uses his powers as a magistrate to offer them legal protection in exchange for a share of their loot, which he needs in order to fund his lavish lifestyle. This change was made in order to comply with the American Production Code, which forbade unsympathetic portrayals of clergymen. Even in the thirties America was the main export market for British films, which meant that the Hays Office could exercise its influence on both sides of the Atlantic.Pengallan was played by that old ham Charles Laughton, who also acted as co-producer and insisted on rewriting the script to give his character greater prominence. Most of the blame for the failure of the film must be laid at his door as it was he, rather than Hitchcock, who had the final say on these matters. Laughton was often prone to overacting, and his performance in Jamaica Inn is one of his hammiest. The ending, rewritten to give him a dramatic death scene, is particularly melodramatic and implausible. Laughton was also responsible for the casting of O'Hara, even though Hitchcock had not wanted to use her after a poor screen test. Her performance in the film itself is a wooden one; Laughton overacts badly, but she underacts equally badly. (Surprisingly, the film was good for O'Hara's career. Laughton was, unaccountably, so taken with her performance that he invited her to play Esmeralda opposite his Quasimodo in The Hunchback of Notre Dame).The critic Michael Medved included Jamaica Inn in his Fifty Worst Movies of All Time. I suspect that Medved was being deliberately provocative; he must have realised that he could not fill his book with fifty examples of Z-movies like Santa Claus Conquers the Martians and that nominating a minor work of a major director for a golden turkey would be a good way of generating controversy. Nevertheless, the film is one of Hitchcock's weakest, lacking not only the drama and suspense we have come to associate with Hitchcock but also the touches of humour he often used to lighten the mood. (Any humour in the film is inadvertent). It is hardly surprising that Du Maurier disliked the adaptation and that Hitchcock left Britain for Hollywood as soon as possible after completing it. Today it is of interest to Hitchcock completists only. 4\/10 ","genre":"Adventure, Crime"},{"date":"23 December 2008","score":"5 out of 8 people found the following review useful","review":" Gone With The Wind is one of those absolutely essential films that all movie lovers must see before they die. This Civil War epic romance\/drama centers around a rather spoiled and selfish young Southern belle named Scarlett. The story follows her through the blissful paradises of plantation dances and pretty dresses to the bitter, cold realities of war and scraping up the pieces afterward. During these trials and tribulations, many very complex relationships and people are examined, all the while using Scarlett as the catalyst. Victor Fleming's visual interpretation of Margaret Mitchell's famous novel is nearly flawless and represents, in my opinion, exactly how a story like this should be told. The lavish sets and costumes burst from the screen in an explosion of color. The cinematography and visual effects evoke a certain dream-like fantasy at certain times and offer stunning realism at others. It's hard to believe this movie was made 70 years ago and it's easy to see why this movie was considered so far ahead of its time upon its release. However, as great as these elements are, the aspect that makes Gone With The Wind a timeless classic is the great performance by the cast. Most have heard of Vivien Leigh's career-defining performance as Scarlett and the way she makes the viewer both love her and hate her with equally burning passions, or of Clark Gable's equally good role as Rhett Bulter, the self-reliant, and some might say, self-centered man who comes to understand the value of integrity and character. But sometimes these two giants overshadow very underrated performances by Leslie Howard, Hattie McDaniel, and Olivia de Havilland. Leslie Howard does a tremendous job of relating to the viewer the inner torment of love versus lust that his character deals with everyday. McDaniel offers a lovable toughness, wisdom, and discipline as the house servant. De Havilland's performance is the most pleasantly surprising, however. In every scene, her character emits purity and goodness in abundance. She truly demonstrates an unconditional love to all those around her despite the difficult circumstances she often finds herself in and is the perfect example of the model that other humans should aspire to become. Through and through, Gone With The Wind is a story that will probably never grow irrelevant, and this 4-hour movie is an astonishing masterpiece that is able to bring deep-buried emotions out of even the most hardened of hearts.

Such were the words shouted by Chuck Noland to his girlfriend Kelly Frears as he hurries off to catch his waiting plane. Little does he suspect how horribly ironic these words become once his tale is over.In Robert Zemeckis' great 'Cast Away', Tom Hanks incarnates Chuck Noland, a highly-efficient FedEx executive whose life is mercilessly governed by the clock. He's in a relationship with Kelly Frears (the pretty Helen Hunt), yet their love is constantly postponed or halted by Chuck's unforgiving timetable. Soon he's called out on a business trip just before Christmas, and he and Kelly exchange some quick gifts she gives him a pocket watch with her picture in the lid, and he gives her an engagement ring box, which she is to open on New Year's Day only &#150; with him there with her. He then leaves and boards the plane.Unfortunately, something goes terribly wrong during the flight (we never learn what, nor is it relevant) and the plane smashes somewhere into the Southern Pacific ocean. The crash scene, with all its technical and visual excitement, is the most terrifying and heart-pounding sequence of its kind I have ever seen. It's so sudden, so unexpected, and so realistic, that you can't help but feel nearly as shocked and horrified as Chuck himself as he sees clouds, and eventually waves, scream past the cockpit windows, coming ever closer &#133; He is the only survivor, and soon he washes up on a large and eerily magnificent desert island, and a quick look-see confirms his worst fears he's absolutely isolated in the middle of the ocean, and no-one knows where he is &#150; or that he's even alive.By then we're barely a quarter into the movie, and the pace, formerly so fast-paced and hurried, suddenly crashes to a halt. All time stands still on the island, itself unchanged for millions and millions of years; only the dull thuds and cracks of falling coconuts, or the occasional arriving flotsam, provide distraction to the new routine Chuck has to endure survival without any electricity, food, water or equipment. Everything he uses, he improvises &#150; sometimes with painful results, other times with triumph. A man who once lived by the pager and the timetable suddenly finds himself in a land where the very concept of 'time' is as alien as fish on Mars, and what he does to survive, both physically and mentally, is where the true storytelling power of the movie lies.The movie is very slow-paced as we follow Chuck's attempts at staying alive, yet unlike most other times where I'd say this, for this movie, being slow is far from criticism; it's praise. The movie doesn't hurry through Chuck's exploits and actions just to 'get to the point'. The story takes its time to settle comfortably into its niche, and once it does, it's truly riveting, even though all we're really looking at is one man on an island, drinking coconut juice and suffering from a toothache without a dentist.The acting is outstanding, especially for Tom Hanks as the castaway in person; he supports the entire movie, and the audience gets to feel both his triumphs and his pains. One scene where he finally is able to light a large signal fire is surprisingly jovial and heartwarming as we see the desperate man jumping, ecstatic, around the burning flames, chanting and avoiding sparks. Other scenes truly make us feel terribly sorry for the man, but rather in resigned, compassionate way. For example, to stay sane, Chuck begins to speak to a Wilson Sporting Goods volleyball, on which a smeared bloody handprint inadvertently created a vague face. Naming the ball 'Wilson', Chuck speaks to 'him' as thought they were old friends, and by then we're so in-tune with Chuck's desperation and loneliness we barely even realize the oddity of a grown man merrily conversating with a volleyball.I naturally can't divulge what happens at the end, or if Chuck ever makes it off the island or not, but I can nonetheless comment on the fact that personally, I found it slightly disappointing. It was a logical ending to the tale (one you may already have guessed if you haven't seen the movie yet), but some parts of it seemed forced, even somewhat clichéd and corny at times. I also didn't understand some of what happened at the very end; perhaps it was too subtle for me. (But then, 'too' subtle would also be ground for criticism.) This is not a movie for viewers who expect action and flash, or for sufferers of short attention spans. For those who are able to take a break from their lives, which so often mirror Chuck Noland's in their pacing, this story will be a soothing and refreshing change of pace while it lasts, and will make a very good addition to any movie-lover's collection.* * * * * For giving us a story with a refreshing change of pace, a lot of sentiment and depth, and some formidable acting, I award 'Cast Away' 8.5 friendly volleyballs out of 10.

I don't think I'm overstating this but to me this movie hits the mark on each joke it tries and that's why this will remain one of the greatest comedies ever made. It's really hard to explain any of the jokes or why they're funny because there's no doubt that they are childish and dumber than dumb itself. Just as you start laughing at one joke before that laugh is over you'll be starting over again on the next one. The jokes are rapid fast and Nielsen handles them with no trouble. His comic timing is perfect for the character and you can't help but feel that Drebin really is that stupid. The supporting characters are all wonderful as they perfectly set up all the jokes for Drebin to bat around. George Kennedy, Priscilla Presley and Ricardo Montalban are all very good and even Simpson comes off quite funny and that's especially true during his opening scene where he gets shot up. What really makes this film is classic to me are its final twenty-minutes, which usually leave me with tears in my eyes from laughing. Being a baseball fan it's priceless seeing Drebin getting involved in a game he clearly knows nothing about.

They make an uneasy pact to hide it and wait until the authorities discover the crash to gauge if they can keep the loot. But the best laid plans of mice and men ...A Simple Plan is a stark, wintry, black-hearted fable of human greed. As a comment on humanity it is almost unremittingly bleak - basically everything goes wrong for and with Hank, Jacob and Lou from the moment they find the money - which may explain why it isn't very well known. However, as an execution in style and suspenseful storytelling it is a brilliant achievement for screenwriter Scott B. Smith (based on his own novel) and director Raimi in an eye-opening move away from the visually dazzling histrionics of his previous work. Whilst there are occasional gasping moments (the bird attack, the sudden rustling of a hospital curtain, the shootout at Lou's house), almost all of the horror comes from the avaricious, mistrusting, pathetic nature of the characters, and in particular the depravities that Hank and his wife will sink to in desperate times. Fonda's big speech near the end, where she describes normal everyday chores as if they were beneath contempt, contrasted with the initial, simple beauty of her character we are introduced to, perfectly sums up this morality tale, and is profoundly effective. Only the borderline-simpleton Jacob emerges with any sort of dignity, and his fate is the most cruel and horrible of all. Raimi works closely with his actors, gently pulling fine performances from all (especially Paxton and Thornton), but also gives his movie an icy sheen - coldness visualised - with many intriguing motifs (foxes and crows, tracks in the snow, Jacob's taped-together glasses) and exquisite pacing, slowly allowing the characters to figuratively dig their own graves. All of this is augmented with a rich, subtle score by Danny Elfman, which traces the moods of the characters, and evokes the loneliness of the location and the tragedy of the story. As in the most evocative drama, the storytelling is carefully minimised, with only a few characters and no subplots, making the suspense all the more uncomfortable. Raimi has often been dismissed by critics as a director who relies too much on flashy technique, with cartoon people in his movies - they should check this out and eat their words. A first-rate thriller on the true nature of evil.

Vera Ellen is a dancer matched only among women by Cyd Charisse. Bing Crosby, other than singing one of the greatest Xmas songs of all time (I won't say best, even if it is the best selling) was a wonderful comic actor whose work here is of the same quality as it was in the Road movies. Rosemary Clooney, perhaps the least of the entertainers, was the best actor of the bunch. But, guess what, you critical Scrooges -- the movie was about the music and the dancing, not the plot or the fake snow or the acting.I missed this point once myself watching Oh Brother! Where art thou? I told a friend the next day after I watched it that it wasn't all that funny a comedy, but, strangely, I couldn't get the music out of my head. He said, you idiot, it's all about the music. Huh? I rented it again. What a great movie once I had my head on straight.So here's your Xmas assignment.
