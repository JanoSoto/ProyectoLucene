The other reason to see this movie is the visual style. With a great production design and a very fine cinematography you almost have the perfect look for a comic book movie, what 'The Crow' is. The movie is dark, may be a little too dark at times, but knows its main characters and therefore chooses this great look.Still, for me it was not enough to like this movie. There were single scenes I did like but as a whole it wasn't very good. There is no story at all. Brandon Lee is Eric. He is killed and his wife is beaten and raped and dies in the hospital as well.

The movie starts off rather slow and the viewer might get a little bored, but once it gets into all the mystery there is no way anyone could fall asleep.  It keeps the audience on their toes and it is very entertaining to watch.  The entire movie is filmed in one community which makes it different from other movies and quite interesting.  The movie stars James Stewart as L.B. Jeff Jeffries and Grace Kelley as Lisa Fremont.      The two work great together on camera and are both very talented actors.  James Stewart, who also starred in It's a Wonderful Life, is the perfect actor to play the part of Jeffries.        His character is an old army man and you can certainly tell through his acting.  Grace Kelley's character is classy and into fashion.  She is beautiful herself which only adds to this view of her character in the movie.  Overall, Stewart and Kelley are definitely the right people to star in Rear WindowThe acting altogether throughout the film is almost never cheesy and is almost always very believable.  All the actors and actresses act so well that it's as if what's happening isn't a move and is really going on.  Even the people with very few lines are believable when they say them. The music is all digetic.  There is never any background music that was added in after filming.  It all comes from a neighbor's piano, a radio, or something in the movie itself.  The fact that there is no added in music just adds to the feeling that what you're watching is really happening.  It makes the movie seem less like a movie and more like real life.There aren't really any special effects in Rear Window because it's not a special effects kind of movie.  There are however a few times in the movie where something or somebody looks very fake and you can tell it isn't really there or that what's happening isn't really happening like the audience sees it.  But those few times don't make a big impact on what the viewer's opinion of the movie is.  It is a very good movie and a few scenes that aren't so well put together don't change that.Rear Window has to be one of the most suspenseful movies there is.  Yes, it isn't full of loads of action but it doesn't need to be.  This movie has shown me that a movie can be simple and not have much bad stuff to be a really good suspense movie.  Rear Window is an awesome movie and is definitely on my see again list.

Or Is it? People who have not seen many Hitchcock Movies, don't know, that  he does more than horror movies, but he does mysteries too.   \tAlfred Hitchcock does a careful job at selecting the perfect cast for this movie. James Stewart as L.B. Jeffries, Grace Kelly as Lisa Carol Freemont. He especially does a great job of casting Raymond Burr as Lars Thorwald. Raymond was in his thirties when this movie was made, but they made him look twenty five years older. Throughout this movie, Jeffries is stuck in his apartment with a broken leg. He is not left alone though. Stella (Thelma Ritter) comes in every day in the morning to take care of him, and Lisa (Grace Kelly) visits him at night. Being stuck in his apartment all day has him bored to death. He has nothing better to do than to look out the rear window at others, either walking around, or across the court yard. Jeffries has a suspicion that Lars Thorwald (across the courtyard) has murdered his wife. Both Stella and Lisa thought he was just going nuts from being cooped up so long in that apartment. But they started to believe him.There are a few differences in this movie compared to psycho. This movie is in color, not black and white. It is a mystery, not a horror film. The back ground music in this movie is either a radio, somebody singing or playing a musical instrument. Not Dissonant string arrangements.It doesn't matter what anyone says, this is without a doubt one of his best movies. If you don't like horror movies, but you are interested in Hitchcock, then you should rent this movie. Even though this is not a horror movie, Alfred Hitchcock still keeps his word at holding all of us in suspense. As I watched the movie, I was literally riveted to my seat. At the beginning, I was inclined to feel the same way as Lisa and Stella. It was apparent that Jeffries had become too involved with the lives of his neighbors and it was this involvement which initially turned Lisa and Stella off.

I found myself becoming interested in the lives of Jeffries neighbors even though I knew they were just fictional characters. Just as I was drawn in to their lives, I found myself following Thorwald's actions. When Thorwald realized he was being watched and it became apparent that he was going to come after Jeffries, I found myself becoming anxious because I knew that Jeffries was alone and because of his injury, he could not escape Thorwald.

I found myself becoming interested in the lives of Jeffries neighbors even though I knew they were just fictional characters. Just as I was drawn in to their lives, I found myself following Thorwald's actions. When Thorwald realized he was being watched and it became apparent that he was going to come after Jeffries, I found myself becoming anxious because I knew that Jeffries was alone and because of his injury, he could not escape Thorwald.  Did Thorwald Murder his wife? Find out by watching this suspenseful thriller!

Which leads to the boys friends brutally beating Harry to the point where he was within an inch of his life from being dead and ending up being literally crucified in an empty back-lot; This is the level of brutality in this movie. A violent brutal and at the same time shockingly honest movie about life in Brooklyn New York circa 1952. During a long and savage dock strike on Brooklyn's heavily industrialized Bush Terminal waterfront. The film is truly disturbing with a shocking and vicious gang rape inter-cut with a baby shower for one of the unions members Big Joe, Burt Young, daughters child at the local union hall. These are just two of many such jolting scenes in the movie. An excellent cast with Stephen Lang, as the union shop steward who's problems are more then just the job that he has on the docks. With Jennifer Jason Leigh, as the bar girl who likes to date and then roll servicemen with the help of her friends to get their money and ends up paying for what she did in more ways then one. With Jerry Orbach as the feisty and two fisted union president who sticks to his guns and in the end gets what he wants for himself and his union members and many many more good actors and the parts that they play in the movie.Last Exit to Brooklyn is a very hard movie to watch but if you want a film with brutal realism and fine acting and photography as well as a story that will grip you right from the start and hold on to you long after the movie is over this is it.

It was worth it mainly for the acting talents of Jena Malone.

Plenty of footage is used to show tobacco-spitting Granny in her rocking chair, but virtually no time is spent explaining who Bone's first stepfather was.  In the cut I saw of the film, Anney tells her daughter she's about to go out with a nice man; she marries him; he treats Bone well, and then he's dead, with his previously unseen family blaming Anney for his death.As for Glen, yes, he's despicable, but aside from being childish and unrealistic about his desire for sons, his early characterization doesn't mesh with Bone's wary response to him.  Perhaps the viewer is meant to understand that the instincts of a child are always on-target, even when an adult is on his best behavior.  Since we already have plenty of voice-over narrative from Bone, could we not have gotten a little clarity on this point as well?  Without some guidance, all we end up with is some clumsy foreshadowing  Uh-oh, Bone doesn't trust him, watch out, he's gonna turn mean.The scenes at the end were also ambiguous.

For a long time she was dubbed as one of the worst actresses, already an Oscar winner for one of my personal favorite movies My Cousin Vinny, Marisa proved to me at least that she could act. I have to admit that before this film I never heard of Tom Wilkinson, but after this film I became a big fan. He is a great actor, I was happy to see that he received an Oscar nomination for his performance as Matt. As great as these performances are, I also really enjoyed the tone of the film.

There is a problem with the story if you really like the book, but otherwise it works very well.  In fact the way each sequence is important means that the film moves very quickly - it's is often a downside if a film shirks on characterisation, but here it works to the film's favour.Part of the reason the script can get away with little character is that Pacino is really good.  He seems to have fallen into `who-ha' shouting of late, but here he has genuine passion and subtlety in his performance. The support cast includes Roberts, Randolph and others, but really it is Pacino's film and his performance reflects that.Overall this is a tragic true story and it is notable that the film doesn't end with the `and then' text.  There is no happy conclusion to the tale, the corruption that Serpico tried to confront and defeat remains in place after he is finished.  Despite this the film is exciting and dramatic as the story deserves.

He first encounters the corrupt side of his job when he is given an envelope of cash.  Even though he refuses to be part of the take, he finds that it goes too high for him to avoid or ignore.  Meanwhile, his colleagues, who already suspect him of being untrustworthy, begin to suspect him of trying to bring actions against the whole force.  As Scerpio lies bleeding from his head wound, he thinks back over his career.Having read the book several times, I was interested in seeing how such a tomb of a book was brought into a two hour movie. I was pleased to find that the answer to this question was `actually pretty well'.

In Braveheart Mel Gibson portrays William Wallace the great Scottish lad (man) who brought peace and freedom to Scotland.  Having a great deal of Scottish background in me, I thought watching a movie about someone who was very important at the time might be a good idea to watch.  I have to tell you I absolutely love the movie.  Mel Gibson, wow, I loved him when I first saw him in Gallipoli, many years ago, and I think he still does a fantastic job today, I beleive over 20 years later.  There hasn't been a movie with Mel that I haven't liked, and I have to say that even though he's done over 50 movies, Braveheart is my ultimate favourite Mel Gibson movie.  Mel portrays an excellent William Wallace, a man who is more than a name to the great country of Scotland.  The movie was very real like, and you could actually see what he was really like.  In the movie Mel sports dreadlocks and he wears a kilt, complete with a Scottish scarf, which is made from Wallace plaid.  Mel also does a great Scottish accent, where most actors besides ones that have a British accent cannot do one, the only other actor that comes close is Mike Myers. The costars were good, however they don't compete with Mel's Oscar-winning performance.  The story was well written, and it has a few emotional parts, my favourite part in the movie, is when they portray a young William Wallace with the little girl and the Scottish thistle.  That was sooo cute.  So, to sum it up, Mel Gibson did look sooo sexy in his kilt, and the movie was breathtaking.

Her father Matthew wants to go fishing on Sundays, while her mother Abigail insists the family go to church. She wants to go skinny-dipping at the Foster pond as soon as she gets home, though.  Only she's not alone  there's a boy there.Dani's sister Maureen is about to leave for Duke University. Her father is very strict, and when a boy comes to take her to a dance, the father gives the boy the third degree. There is good reason for concern, but not necessarily what one might think.Abigail reunites with her old friend Marie after many years.  If circumstances had been different, Marie would have married Matthew, and Abigail would have married the man Marie just lost because the man had a dangerous job.  Marie has three sons, while Abigail is pregnant with what may be daughter no. 4 (or maybe there will finally be a son).This movie is best when Dani is with the boy she likes, and there is also a funny scene where Maureen explains kissing to Dani.  There is a lot of comedy, but also a near tragedy and a tragedy.  I would have been happier without the more serious of these events, but what it did for the relationship between Dani and Maureen made the terrible event more worthwhile.The credits said 'introducing Reese Witherspoon'.  Still, she did a wonderful job, and showed that she had a lot of potential.  And she had a great smile.  I thought most of the leading actors did a good job.Overall, it was worth seeing.
