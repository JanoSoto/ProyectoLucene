The lampoon idea is excellent and I found myself laughing at some of the jokes, a dig at Disney?Shrek as a whole is not entirely satisfying, by the end, I was perplexed that the picture was missing a strong character\/villain conflict.Never mind the shortcoming of the villain, Shrek is all about lampoons and the jokes. The picture is entertaining, and Donkey steals the show. Voiced by Eddie Murphy, he brings energy to the character. Mike Myer's Shrek is slightly underwhelming. The CGI is quality, really fantastic.Pixar is still leading the computer animation, Toy Story adventures will be difficult to top. Shrek was a decent effort, but needed  meat to fatten the story and the villain.
