She comes from a wealthy family and it is her wish to start a new life in Africa after being jilted by a man she loved. Although Karen thinks they are going to have a cattle farm, her no-good new husband goes to Africa first and inks a deal to raise coffee. On the journey to Kenya, Karen meets a safari guide named Denis (Robert Redford) and has a few brief but interesting conversations. Once in Africa, Karen's new husband proves to be a disaster as a mate. Not only is he unfaithful but, he goes off to join the fight in a small local war and leaves Karen to run the farm herself. Admirably, Karen proves to be a good farm manager and a kind caretaker to the Africans who work on her farm. Over the ensuing months and years, however, Karen grows closer to Denis until they are greatly in love. But, does happiness really last forever? This is a based-on-fact story of Karen Blixen who wrote her own autobiography, Out of Africa. She, as one can easily see from this story, was a great storyteller, writer, and lady. As Karen, Meryl Streep gives one of her most worthy performances, touched with beauty and great angst. Redford, too, gives a nice performance as the man who truly loves Karen and shows her the world's possibilities but, who remains a man apart. The rest of the cast is wonderful, the costumes are very lovely, and the Kenya setting one of the most beautiful ever recorded on film. On top of that, the script by Kurt Luedtke is elegantly memorable as he incorporates Blixen's own words into the overall story and does it very, very well. The striking mantra, I had a farm in Africa, goes deeper and deeper into the heart as the film progresses. No one who cares about film, about romance, about adventure or about humanity should really miss this movie. It is a towering achievement and it will remain as an example of the best of what cinema truly is for years and years to come.

''Final Cut'' is intense. A decapitation during which a dog is fed the victim's entrails is only the start of a killing spree with a high hemoglobin count. Predictably, just one student, perky Amy Mayfield (Jennifer Morrison), is even remotely aware of strange goings- on as she works on her own film about a serial killer. As in all dopey horror movies, things squeak and bump alarmingly; there are mysterious power shutdowns, a full moon behind a veil of wind-swept clouds and shadowy forms that lurk and occasionally leap. The heroine stupidly ventures alone into the night to check out suspicious noises or suggestions of strange events. The killer is seemingly everywhere and tends to pop up wearing a fencer's mask of mesh, as one by one the student body on the isolated campus shrinks. The idea for viewers is to try to not see the illogic in any of it as they crane for the next bloodbath. A finale exposes the killer in a theme park mine-train attraction. Fellow students are played by relative unknowns Eva Mendes as a brash lesbian, Jessica Cauffiel as a screechy wannabe actress, Marco Hofschneider as an arrogant European cinematographer and Hart Bochner as the devoted professor. Matthew Davis plays the handsome stud who seems to suddenly have a twin brother after he dies in the tower of a campus building. One minute Amy beds down with the brother, and the next she has a nightmare that he's about to rub her out with a dagger while they make love. Not safe sex, so to speak. OverallSuperbly executed, Urban Legends Final Cut is a gripping ride into terror, embracing the horror genre wholeheartedly and giving us a nail-biting, heart-jolting experience. John Ottman stamps it decisively as his own with assured, confident direction, slick editing and a magnificent, large orchestral score that pounds along with our hearts. A different experience to Jamie Blanks' first Urban Legend.

Aside from starring George Sanders, VILLAGE OF THE DAMNED was made on a shoestring budget yet was one of the most effective and scary films of all time. While this movie isn't quite as good, it is exceptional--especially when it has a significantly lower budget than VILLAGE. The film was shot around Lawrence, Kansas (not exactly a film mecca) and featured locals and small-time actors.The film starts with two cars drag racing through the countryside. The one vehicle with three young ladies aboard crashes off the side of a bridge and into the water below. It appears they are all killed but dragging the river is tough since the current is very strong. Then, unexpectedly, after three hours, one of the young ladies climbs out of the water--shaken and dirty but otherwise alright!The next day, the lady leaves town forever to take up the job as a church organist in a city far away. It becomes pretty obvious based on her actions and body language that she is a pretty asocial type person (a schizoid personality is the correct psychological term, by the way) AND she also has little, if any, appreciation for the church--to her it's just a job. However, her tough exterior is quite shaken when she begins seeing a scary dead-looking guy during her drive to the new town. This begins as her car passes an old abandoned carnival but she continues periodically seeing this zombie-like guy once she arrives in the new town. Locals suspect she is crazy and after a while the lady isn't so sure of her sanity as well!! What she IS sure of is that somehow this carnival is the key, so in the end she goes there at night for a showdown.There's a lot more to the film than this, but I don't want to spoil any of the suspense--and there is a lot of it!! Despite the low budget, this is a scare the pants off you type film that is great to watch alone late at night!!! Additionally, the non-professional actors did a bang-up job--this is a true cult classic and deserves to be well remembered.

Very Complex and not easy going and very well done. Flawless performances I just love it. It's one of those classics that always stays in your mind.

I remember the first time I saw it, I was in some department store, and I saw a scene playing on the store t.v. It was the scene where Forrest is on Merv Griffin (?) I believe, talking with John Lennon, and actually my first impression was that it was forced, and contrived. Corny. So, I never really watched the whole film, until a year or two ago. This movie brings so many tears to my eyes, not because of sadness, but because of the simplicity of life, relationships, and different stories. The little feather in the beginning of the film seems to be on a journey visiting different lives, and by the end of the story, when the little feather moves on on it's path, you are so touched and moved by the beautiful story of Forrest Gump.My favorite character is probably Lt. Dan. Forrest meets Lt. Dan in Vietnam, and when Dan loses the bottom half of his legs, he has a problem, putting it lightly, with God, and his destiny. But, through the years, and by knowing Forrest, he comes to terms with his situation, and one of my favorite scenes is where Dan is swimming in the ocean. It shows how much he CAN do, as he can swim just fine, and enjoy that wonderful, cool, free experience available to most of us. By the end of the film he has come such a long way; he is happy, engaged to a nice girl, and walking on titanium legs, with the help of a cane. And boy is he easy on the eyes, at that! I liked the character of Jenny, but I hated how she kept leaving Forrest, and not telling him why. She deserted him quite a bit. Yet he could not hold it against her. She was a survivor of child sexual abuse and incest, so that helps to explain her lifelong struggle with depression. In the end, she does give Forrest a wonderful gift in the form of his son, Little Forrest. However, I thought it a little strange how they handled the A.I.D.S. idea. I mean, if she had A.I.D.S., wouldn't they allude to some form of protection, for Forrest, after they got married? Even though she died in 1982 (according to the headstone)the medical profession did know at that time, that it was a sexually transmitted disease. And, I am assuming that she meant AIDS, when she said that she had a virus that the docs didn't know what it was, and that there was nothing that they could do about it. I never read the book, so I don't know if it was explained a little more there. One other little question I had was the scene where Forrest opens a letter from Lt. Dan, telling him that he would never need to worry about money ever again, because of their investments in Apple. The letter head says 1975. Hmmmm. I guess I'll have to do my research and see when Apple became a multi-million dollar company, and went public. I know that when I was in high school in 1982, we were still learning Pascal, or whatever those old fashioned computer languages were at that point, before user friendly p.c.s hit the market. I didn't know that Apple was that big, already. It may prove that I am just ignorant, and can use a lesson in business history. Other than that, and the two scenes of John Lennon, and President Kennedy, which I thought were hokey, the movie was a huge success in my book. It's a truly beautiful film, and I also like the woman at the bus stop who ends up staying, missing her bus on purpose, so that she can listen to Gump. She is a neat character, who is moved by his story. If you like beautiful, moving films, see this one.

The wedding scene is preposterous Harold Russell has to put the ring on Cathy O'Donnell's finger, a delicate operation with brutal-looking hooks; she's terrified he'll drop it; her parents are against the wedding anyway; Dana Andrews has his back but he's on the skids himself - and the sailor not only performs, but soothes Wilma's trembling hand with his grim prosthetic. This should not work. This should be ridiculous. But the thrill is genuine, because the trick is delivered with an absolutely straight face.

March never was more complex and true.

Since he's occupied working long hours draining out and hauling the smelly and disgusting waste products from the johns to the local waste treatment plant. One evening Henry learns that both Rooter & Kai are not all all that interested in what their supposed to be doing but using it as a front for their real job. A job that pays as much as $1,500, not the $40.00 that Henry has been getting, a day. Their professional torches or arsonists who are hired to burn down, and make it look like an accident, highly insured properties by the very persons who own them.Getting involve in torching private houses and wear-houses gives Henry the opportunity to get back to his murderous ways. This shocks his friend and fellow arsonist Kai who at first thought that Henry was a real stand-up guy who you can go out to the local bar and have a couple of beers with. With Henry getting so completely caught up with his homicidal tendencies, he mostly kills just to keep from getting bored, Kai's wife Cricket, Kate Welsh, wants him out of her and Kia's house where Henry is a non-paying tenant. The last straw with Cricket is when her what seems like semi-retarded niece Louisa, Carri Levenson, falls madly in love with the madman.Henry to his credit want's nothing to do with Lousia knowing that he's not her type but the star-struck young girl won't take no for an answer going so far as to threaten suicide if he doesn't marry her and take her away from both Kai & her aunt Cricket. During all this time Henry is slowly getting the somewhat alcoholic Kai involved in a string of brutal murders that has nothing at all to do with either the port-a-toilet or arson business but does quench Henry's thirst for blood and violence.Like the Frankenstein Monster Henry loses what little control he had of himself and uses what he learned from both Kai and Rooter for his own evil purposes. In the end Henry ends up murdering both of them and later together with Kia's murdered wife Cricket incinerates them. In the case of Kia, while he's still alive and breathing, in order to hide the evidence of his crimes.The relationship that Henry had with Lousia was about the only interesting thing in the film. Since it showed that he had at least some kind of human feelings in not wanting her to be stuck with him knowing that this brief sense of humanity, on Henry's part, may quickly evaporate and lead him to murder her, which for some strange reason he was very reluctant to do. It turned out that the very emotionally disturbed Lousia didn't have to have Henry do her in since she did a good job, by blowing her brains out, doing it herself.Nowhere as good as the original but still very shocking to watch in that Henry now has a new weapon, in becoming a skilled torch man or arsonist, in his vast arsenal of death and destruction. A weapon which he'll undoubtedly use in the future to continue his reign of terror on humanity. A weapon of death and destruction which he learned from his former employers and latest victims Kai & Rooter.

He works as a server at Starbucks, is obsessed with The Beatles, and loves IHOP. After he accidentally has a daughter (Dakota Fanning) with a homeless woman who he names after the song Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds. The woman leaves him, and Sam is left to care for Lucy by himself. However, when Lucy intentionally begins to hold back in school to prevent becoming smarter from her father, child protective services takes her away and Sam must fight to obtain custody. He befriends a lawyer, Rita (Michelle Pfeiffer) with a bad marriage and a son who she thinks hates her. Together, Sam and Rita fight for Lucy's custody in a heartwrenching roller coaster of tears, laughs, and the overwhelming power of human spirit.This is all beside some of the most stunning performances I've ever seen in a film. Sean Penn is top of his game and gives an amazingly realistic performance as a disabled man without a single flaw. To this day it makes me furious he didn't win the Oscar. Dakota Fanning's premiere role is by far her greatest ever, and at only six years old opened the eyes of actresses who've been in the business for years and basically screamed into their faces This is how acting is done. And Michelle Pfeiffer delivers a phenomenal, incredibly realistic performance that will absolutely take your breath away.As the film progresses, you will find yourself laughing one minute, crying the next (you WILL cry no matter how mature or old you are, so make sure you have tissues), the next moment tapping your foot along to the familiar Beatles tunes found throughout the movie (even though they're covers) and the next moment simply staring at the screen not believing your eyes and ears at how emotionally powerful a film can be.And after watching, you won't want to ever give the DVD back to Blockbuster. If you don't at least give this movie a chance, you will truly be missing out on one of the shiniest gems of modern cinema ever.

It really isn't their best or most memorable one though.Lets face it and be honest here, this movie really isn't the greatest made or best written one. The only real reason that the movie still works out is thanks to the Muppets. The humor actually isn't that much good, since its mostly simply written and the events are predictable. Nevertheless the movie still manages to become funny because of the humorous and well known characters, that need no introduction.For me it really was in this case Miss Piggy that makes the movie work out. Her character features by far the most humorous and enjoyable situations. Miss Piggy is basically a Muppet-favorite of every one! She is such a great and comical character. Also the idea alone that a grown up man, such as Frank Oz, is with his hand inside a silly looking pig and doing a very feminine voice is reason enough already to crack me up. I really respect the Muppet-performers and their timing and handling is always just great, especially Frank Oz who always is subtle and handles the most enjoyable Muppet characters. Besides acting, Frank Oz also was the person who directed and wrote the movie.The movie concentrates a bit too much on just the two main characters of the movie; Kermit and Miss Piggy. Also the human cast gets wasted because of that but of course also most of the Muppet characters. They put (too) many Muppets in the movie but doesn't provide them with enough room to let them shine, or their characters speak out. They tried to do so by putting in some extra solo sequences, featuring some of the Muppet characters, which felt like a last minute addition but was amusing, though distracting, nevertheless. The movie also features Rizzo the Rat in his first big movie role but it's too bad that he didn't teamed up with Gonzo yet in this on. The movie could had really used another and distracting from the main plot, comical duo, besides Kermit and Miss Piggy.The movie yet again features many cameo from well known actors and other celebrities. Celebrities and Muppets always have been a great combination.

Putting someone in a Miss Piggy suit when she is on roller-blades, bad idea!Though the movie is mostly forgettable it of course still features some great sequences such as the one with the Muppet babies.

The meaning in this case was, as stated by a fellow user below, is faith within yourself. Graham isn't just battling the aliens in this movie, the main idea is of him battling himself and his inner demons.Personally i believe (since its technically classified as a sci-fi\/horror) that this is in fact one of the best horror films of all time. All of you expecting big ugly aliens with guns that can kill us to be scarier need to crawl back under your rocks.

The main character is well-played by Winona Ryder and features an excellent cast, including Angelina Jolie, Whoopi Goldburg and Brittany Murphy. They give some powerful performances.I found the movie to be funny, charming and entertaining in depicting the relationships of these women in a psychiatric ward. Basically, the story revolves around the young woman's journey back to sanity after her initial diagnosis of BPD--Borderline Personality Disorder. The best part about this movie is the emphasis on love and friendship that develop between the patients and staff. That being said, the movie should come with a warning that much of the story is a gross deviation from the true story, the book by the same name Girl, Interrupted, written by the subject of it, Susanna Kaysen which is an account of her hospitalization experience. I've seen many user comments from people who haven't read the book referring to it as the true story not knowing that many scenes and events never occurred. There are various changes made in certain characters, some big, some small but the most major change is the character, Lisa Rowe, a sociopath (played by Anjelina Jolie). In the movie, she is enigmatic, somewhat cruel, sinister at times and indirectly causes the death of another patient through her cruelty. Eventually, she becomes homicidal and stalks Susanna through the tunnels underneath the hospital with a hypodermic needle loaded with who-knows-what. The thing is, the real-life Lisa never did any of those things which are significant alterations of a character and subsequently the storyline (not to mention slanderous). It bothers me because it reinforces Hollywood stereotypes of mental illness--some things being distorted in order to sensationalize--the butcher-knife wielding mental patient is always more interesting than the real thing to movie-makers. Actually, some of the things that the real Lisa did were more interesting to me, like toilet-papering the TV room and stealing all the light bulbs from the ward (when asked how, she said I have a long skinny arm.) Ultimately, it doesn't reflect the true story by Ms. Kaysen whose book is an endearing, honest, meaningful and insightful look at the real experience of mental illness. I would say that as a **fictional** story for entertainment value, it's a good movie and worth watching but if you want the **truth**, I highly recommend you check out the book from your local library.

Kumar finds he cannot live without Maya and finds her in the harem, where he is discovered and condemned to a spectacular and particularly brutal death.
