[{"date":"18 November 2012","score":"","review":" In 1730 B.C. the Princess Anckesenamon (played by Zita Johann) passes away. Madly in love with her, the High Priest of Karnak, Imhotep (Boris Karloff) decides to commit sacrilege by reading from the Scroll of Thoth to bring her back to life. Caught in the act by the Pharaoh (James Crane), Imhotep is buried alive along with the Scroll of Thoth. In 1921 an archaeologist named Sir Joseph Whemple (Arthur Byron) and his assistant discover the mummy of Imhotep. They also find a box which carries a warning that whoever opens it will die. Recognizing that there is a curse placed upon it, a professor of the occult named Dr. Muller (Edward Van Sloan) warns Sir Joseph Whemple and his assistant not to open the box. However, the assistant does and upon reading the Scroll of Thoth brings the mummy back to life. The assistant then goes insane and the mummy walks out with the Scroll of Thoth. Ten years later, the mummy (who now calls himself Ardath Bay) reveals to the archeologist's son, Frank Whemple (David Manners) where the tomb of Princess Anckesenamon can be found. Although he is also an archaeologist, Frank sends a message to his father to come to Cairo and assist him with this new find. At the same time, Dr. Muller has also arrived in Cairo with a young lady he and his wife are taking care of named Helen Grosvenor (also played by Zita Johann). While reciting incantations, Ardath Bay draws her to him in order to bring Princess Anckesenamon back to life. Anyway, having given the first part of the story I will stop right here so as not to spoil the film for anyone who hasn't seen it. I will say, however, that this is one of the best classic horror films ever made. The plot is outstanding, the script is excellent, the characters were well developed and the actors all performed in an exceptional manner, with the best performance being done by Boris Karloff. Like two earlier classics made the year prior (Dracula and Frankenstein) this film is a true gem and definitely worth viewing.

I found her acting better than Garland's. Again I might get flak for saying that but I actually enjoyed her performance, whereas with Garland I found her acting flat.The basic plot is that it is 6 months since Dorothy's Oz visit (judging on what things look like in Oz, I'm assuming it's non-canon with the 1939 film) and she has trouble sleeping. Aunt Em is concerned for her and decides to send her to a hospital of some kind, when Dr Worley (played by Nicol Williamson) decides to somehow remove electricity from Dorothy's brain about Oz there is a power blackout and a mysterious girl helps her escape.Soon Dorothy is back in the land of Oz with one of her chickens who can now talk (I know... weird) and finds out that Oz is not the place she remembered with The Gnome King (played by Williamson, again) and Princess Mombi ruling Oz (or what's left of it). Along the way she meets a clockwork robot, a flying moose-head sofa hybrid (Again... weird) and a man made out of wood with a Pumpkin for a head. Together they embark on a journey to stop the Gnome King and rescue The Scarecrow (because of 2 reasons, firstly he was The King of Oz and he's the only friend of Dorothy's that wasn't turned to stone).Unlike other people, I enjoyed this even more than the 1939 version. I found the performances of the actors better, no annoying musical numbers (like the Munchkin song). I would recommend it to people who want to see a good fantasy\/kids film. Although if you have kids of a young age (like 4-7) then don't show it to them, the Gnome king could be intimidating to them. However if you're over that age you should be fine.

The film is a great remake of the original 1961 film, and the new cast did an awesome job with their roles. The film is well directed with great filming and production and even though the same actress plays the leading role as two people, the film is put together seamlessly. When two identical girls meet unexpectedly at summer camp, they knew they had to be related. After almost twelve years, the twins, Hallie Parker and Annie James (doubly-played by Lindsay Lohan), were finally reunited with one another. They were separated at birth when their parents got divorced. One twin went to England with their mother, Elizabeth Parker (played by Natasha Richardson), and the other with their father, Nick Parker (played by Dennis Quaid). After summer camp, they wanted to meet their other parent that the hadn't seen since they were born, so they had the bright idea that they would switch lives and go to the other twin's house. They each pretend to be one another as they lived their new lives in opposite sides of the world, but while Annie is meeting her father, he tells her the unexpected news that he is going to get married to his new fiancé named Meredith Blake (played by Elaine Hendrix). Annie calls Hallie immediately and, long story short, that's when they come up with a plan to bring Elizabeth James back to the wedding so they can trap them and get them to fall in love with each other again. The cast of the film does a great job playing their characters and they really make the movie come together perfectly, especially Lindsay Lohan. When you watch the movie, you forget that it is the same girl that is playing both girls. She does such a good job at making the characters totally different with their accents and personalities that you forget that it is the same girl playing that part. Lohan does an outstanding job at making the movie go seamlessly together and to make it seem like real life. This movie is very well crafted. The directors did a great job with the locations that the film is shot at, and making sure that these scenes go together and fit together like a glove. Starting with the camp, where the girls meet, to their dad's house in Napa Valley, to the mom's house in England, to the camp grounds where they go through good times with their father and new step mother, to the hotel and wedding site to the end of the movie where Elizabeth and Nick come back to the Queen Elizabeth where they first got married. I liked how it had a variety of different scenes that took place in different destinations all over the world, and the producers and filmmakers did a good job at making sure you knew exactly where everything happened. The camera footage and production of the film really enhanced the movie. When they filmed certain things, they had just the right angle to make you feel like you were in the movie. One particular example is when they were camping with Nick and Meredith and the twins played a prank and put a lizard on her Evian bottle. The camera got the lizard coming towards her mouth so it looked like it was happening to you. Another example is when they prank the girls in the cabin. They had all kinds of traps set up so that when you walked or opened a door, something would fall on you-and the cameras were there to capture each time something fell. There was a part where a huge bucket of chocolate syrup was poured on one girl, and the cameras were there to let you watch it fall from the bucket to the top of the girl's head. Without the great production and footage that the cameras got this movie wouldn't have been as good. This movie is one that will never get old, no matter how many times you watch it. Once you see the film, you without a doubt will want to watch it again. All the actors and directors and producers and everyone else involved in making this film were definitely successful, and they did a great job with the movie.

The story follows Michael Myers (Tony Moran), who killed his sister, Judith (Sandy Johnson) 15 years prior. Years later, as his doctor (Donald Pleasence) and a nurse (Nancy Stephens) try to transfer him to complete mental lockdown, he escapes and heads to Haddonfield to go after a couple of teens (P.J. Soles, Nancy Kyes, John Michael Graham) and his sister (Jamie Lee Curtis, in her first film role.)This film is absolutely one of the best films I've ever seen, not just one of the best horror films. In fact, this IS THE BEST horror film I've seen to date. The film just sticks with you even after you go to sleep, it haunts you in your dreams. Tony Moran really defines the Michael Myers character. I mean, it's easy to just stick a mask on a guy and then have him walk around and kill people, but he adds a sense of madness to the character that you wouldn't expect. Jamie Lee Curtis, who's first film role was this movie, did a great job playing Laurie, especially in the final climatic 15 minutes. Donald Pleasence really defines the Dr. Samuel Loomis character, as he is an important plot point and his speech about Michael while him and Sheriff Brackett are in the Myers house is truly a great scene. The rest of the cast are also great, especially Nancy Kyes and P.J. Soles, who play Annie and Lynda, respectively.The music and cinematography in this film is beautifully chilling. Considering this movie was made on a real shoestring budget, it's amazing how they were able to construct this film in a way that it is one of the scariest horror films to audiences. The music was created by Carpenter in a matter of 4 days, which is equally shocking because it could have taken much longer, and would have been bad. But Carpenter truly created the theme of the holiday. The cinematography and direction is great as well because you feel like you are with the people as the film progresses.The writing of this film is just brilliant, Hill wrote the girls speech, and it was sounded like real girls were chatting amongst themselves. I'm assuming Carpenter did the speech of Dr. Loomis and it's just as equally brilliant.I'm going to stop rambling now, but to close off, the film is excellent and is a classic amongst the genre.

They desperately want children, and we get the impression they have been trying for some time. Enter Jed Hill, new Doctor at the local hospital, who meets and befriends Andy. So much so that Andy offers him the opportunity to rent a room at his home until he can get settled. Jed accepts, and Andy and Tracey become his landlords. Andy is distracted as he is dealing with the fact that someone is raping and murdering young girls from his college. The Police are all over the case, and even Andy himself is not above suspicion, and he is doing all he can to protect his young students. Against this backdrop, Jed is out letting off steam one night, and is drunk in a local bar when his emergency beeper goes. Jed rushes into the hospital to find Tracey, his landlord and his best friend's wife on the operating table. Andy arrives within minutes and Jed has to speak to him and tell him he can save Tracey, but must remove her ovaries, as they are necrotic. Andy of course tells Jed to save Tracey's life, which Jed does. However, when Tracey wakes from under the anaesthetic and finds she cannot ever bear children the movie really gets going. Tracey sues Jed and the Hospital. Jed, it seems, when forced to make a judgement call, got it wrong and removed a healthy ovary. Andy is left alone, with Tracey too traumatised to speak to him, and in hiding while her lawyer gets in to the business of suing the hospital, ending Jed's medical career and getting her compensation for the loss of her ovaries. Andy is desperate to contact her, but doesn't know where to find her. Jed has resigned himself to moving out of the Safian home, and is quietly drinking himself to oblivion in a rented hotel room. Out of sheer desperation to see and talk to Tracey, Andy muscles his way into her lawyers office, and demands to see her. Her lawyer turns him down flat, on instructions from Tracey. Clearly she does not want Andy in her life at all at this point. Then, a small scrap of seemingly innocuous information is let slip by the lawyer he has worked for Tracey before, when he did some work that involved Tracey's mother. This is news to Andy, who had always believed that Tracey's parents were long dead. In desperation, Andy tracks down Tracey's mother. The film steps up another gear at this point, and is well worth the effort of watching it. There are no weak spots in this cast, Pullman, Kidman and Baldwin are note perfect, but there is great support from such luminaries as George C Scott and the absolutely wonderful Anne Bancroft, who steals her one, pivotal, critical scene effortlessly. But that's not the end of it, there's also the fine Peter Gallagher, the lovely Bebe Neuwirth (who makes a great cop by the way), and in lesser roles, there's Tobin Bell (who became SAW, and shows his scary credentials here too) and finally a bit part for Gwyneth Paltrow as a surly student. The remainder of the film is full of surprises, and when the curtain is finally pulled back and the magician revealed, you have to marvel at the depth, scope and ambition of the plot. The movie easily bears multiple viewings, as you will undoubtedly spot things the second and even third times that failed to register on the first viewing. A clever, dark and intricate movie, with all the stars on top form. A last word about Alec Baldwin. His acting is out of the top drawer in this movie, and that is not meant to detract from the performances of Pullman and Kidman, who are also very very good. I guarantee you that you will watch the scene where Andy (Pullman)tracks down Tracey's mother (Bancroft) again and again. It is an absolute delight.

They desperately want children, and we get the impression they have been trying for some time. Enter Jed Hill, new Doctor at the local hospital, who meets and befriends Andy. So much so that Andy offers him the opportunity to rent a room at his home until he can get settled. Jed accepts, and Andy and Tracey become his landlords. Andy is distracted as he is dealing with the fact that someone is raping and murdering young girls from his college. The Police are all over the case, and even Andy himself is not above suspicion, and he is doing all he can to protect his young students. Against this backdrop, Jed is out letting off steam one night, and is drunk in a local bar when his emergency beeper goes. Jed rushes into the hospital to find Tracey, his landlord and his best friend's wife on the operating table. Andy arrives within minutes and Jed has to speak to him and tell him he can save Tracey, but must remove her ovaries, as they are necrotic. Andy of course tells Jed to save Tracey's life, which Jed does. However, when Tracey wakes from under the anaesthetic and finds she cannot ever bear children the movie really gets going. Tracey sues Jed and the Hospital. Jed, it seems, when forced to make a judgement call, got it wrong and removed a healthy ovary. Andy is left alone, with Tracey too traumatised to speak to him, and in hiding while her lawyer gets in to the business of suing the hospital, ending Jed's medical career and getting her compensation for the loss of her ovaries. Andy is desperate to contact her, but doesn't know where to find her. Jed has resigned himself to moving out of the Safian home, and is quietly drinking himself to oblivion in a rented hotel room. Out of sheer desperation to see and talk to Tracey, Andy muscles his way into her lawyers office, and demands to see her. Her lawyer turns him down flat, on instructions from Tracey.

In the Horror encyclopedia, Urban Legend wouldn't appear in one of the sub-genre's chapters, but rather in an appendix.The idea is, in my opinion, very original and very well portrayed. A killer who eliminates victims one by one in accordance with the scenery and background story of the famous urban legends we all know and love (and some that I personally have only learnt of through this film). However, Urban Legend is also a stereotypical 90's Horror in many ways... the characters being college students (and actors made famous by a then successful TV drama), the location being college\/dorm\/student apartment, the killer being a character we've already seen, even the little wink at parody (in this case - the radio playing Dawson's Creak theme when Joshua Jackson starts his car). Also, no gore but plenty of blood in the right places. All not unlike the two famous Horror brands of the time, Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer.All in all, Urban Legends is a great film using a great idea. However, while not being able to point a finger to it, it feels like it lacks something. Perhaps a smarter twist in the end, or a more realistic ending. Perhaps the fact that the idea of using urban legends as inspiration has been the best part of the film, while the rest was not more than average. Perhaps the shortage of true Horror and fear.

When I found out Shawshank Redemption was a movie based off a Stephen King book, I expected a creepy horror movie, sort of like The Shinning. Needless to say, I was pleasantly surprised. Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman, and the rest of the cast deliver in one of the greatest films ever made in history, at least according to IMDb, it was ranked number one. So how does one review possibly the best movie ever made?The first time I watched Shawshank Redemption I wasn't really impressed, but when I saw it ranked atop the leader board on IMDb, I watched it again, and I agreed with its place. This movie was absolutely fantastic. The story flows and connects really well. The characters are lovable and important to the overall story and by the end it made me just go, wow that was awesome. This is a story of a man named Andy Dufresne who was convicted for the murder of his wife and the man who she had an affair with. When Dufresne arrives in Shawshank he keeps a low profile but struggles with what one would call normal prison problems. He then uses his intelligence of the business world to get on the good side of the guards and the warden. He makes the warden really wealthy and prison life becomes simpler. Then the story develops from there and it is rather complex, but I won't give too much away.I have to start with a few flaws I saw in this movie. The story was a bit slow with a lot of scenes or stories within the major story taking place. In the beginning Andy had problems with the perverts of the prison, or Andy playing the music over the speakers of the prison etc. A few of these stories were pointless and just made me think, Why? Some were definitely amusing but it is only a small gripe. Maybe if I watch it again I will appreciate them more, but for now it just dragged the story if you ask me. A second problem, and this really bugged me, was the fact that Andy Dufresne entered the prison in 1947 and left in 1966. That is a 19 year period. For a story to last 19 years is not a problem at all, but the fact that the characters do not age annoyed me a lot. Morgan Freeman was supposed to be in his 40s at the start. Now it doesn't matter what decade it is in real life, Morgan Freeman always looks old and wise. And by the end, Freeman didn't really age at all. Sure maybe a gray hair or two, but that was it. Dufresne looked the exact same and so did the Warden. Now some might ask why 19 year storyline but it makes sense if you actually see the movie. The director could have easily added some wrinkles, white hair, something, but there was nothing and it didn't make the time span believable. When Freeman narrates it's 1966 I didn't really believe it. Little details like that are things I can overlook because it is such a fantastic movie but small things like that make an awesome movie a classic movie.The major strength of the movie, in my opinion, is the characters. Dufresne, Red, the warden are the main characters so obviously they will have complexity and lovability, but even smaller characters like Brooks are still important. Brooks showed the prisoner who spends his life in prison and knows nothing else. He is a minor character but he made me think of prison life and prisoners themselves. When he got out of prison he didn't know what to do, he even wanted to stay. He had a minor role with a big impact. Even when he is gone he is remembered and mentioned many times. I really don't remember his name but the character who was the stereotypical 60s man and resembled Elvis was possibly the most important character of all (I'm just going to call him Elvis.). To save spoilers I will only hit the tip of the iceberg. The main story connects with the minor stories told throughout the movie really well but the all seemed pointless until Elvis shows up in Shawshank. He gives Dufresne what he needs and makes the warden put on his evil pants. Basically, he is the turning point of the story and makes it relevant. If you saw the movie you will know exactly what I mean, and if you haven't then go see it so you aren't completely lost. Now the ending was absolutely phenomenal. Throughout the entire move I was thinking what the point was and where it was going, but by the end it is so surprising and personally I thought it was unexpected. It makes you appreciate the idea of storytelling and keeping an audience interested and when I watched it a second time it was one of those times when you think, Why didn't I see this coming? I love it when movie do that because it makes me think and if a movie makes me think it means I am interested and it does its job of being a good movie.Overall The Shawshank Redemption is a classic, possibly one of the best of all time. Do I think it deserves number one on IMDb's list? No, absolutely not but it should be in the top 10. A bit of a slow start to an amazing story that connects really well, a cast of characters portrayed in depth and detail, and an ending that will possibly blow your mind all form together to form on of, but not the best, movie of all time and without a shadow of a doubt gets the WillyT seal of approval.

In the beginning Andy had problems with the perverts of the prison, or Andy playing the music over the speakers of the prison etc. A few of these stories were pointless and just made me think, Why? Some were definitely amusing but it is only a small gripe. Maybe if I watch it again I will appreciate them more, but for now it just dragged the story if you ask me. A second problem, and this really bugged me, was the fact that Andy Dufresne entered the prison in 1947 and left in 1966. That is a 19 year period. For a story to last 19 years is not a problem at all, but the fact that the characters do not age annoyed me a lot. Morgan Freeman was supposed to be in his 40s at the start. Now it doesn't matter what decade it is in real life, Morgan Freeman always looks old and wise. And by the end, Freeman didn't really age at all. Sure maybe a gray hair or two, but that was it. Dufresne looked the exact same and so did the Warden. Now some might ask why 19 year storyline but it makes sense if you actually see the movie. The director could have easily added some wrinkles, white hair, something, but there was nothing and it didn't make the time span believable. When Freeman narrates it's 1966 I didn't really believe it. Little details like that are things I can overlook because it is such a fantastic movie but small things like that make an awesome movie a classic movie.The major strength of the movie, in my opinion, is the characters. Dufresne, Red, the warden are the main characters so obviously they will have complexity and lovability, but even smaller characters like Brooks are still important. Brooks showed the prisoner who spends his life in prison and knows nothing else. He is a minor character but he made me think of prison life and prisoners themselves. When he got out of prison he didn't know what to do, he even wanted to stay. He had a minor role with a big impact. Even when he is gone he is remembered and mentioned many times. I really don't remember his name but the character who was the stereotypical 60s man and resembled Elvis was possibly the most important character of all (I'm just going to call him Elvis.). To save spoilers I will only hit the tip of the iceberg. The main story connects with the minor stories told throughout the movie really well but the all seemed pointless until Elvis shows up in Shawshank. He gives Dufresne what he needs and makes the warden put on his evil pants. Basically, he is the turning point of the story and makes it relevant. If you saw the movie you will know exactly what I mean, and if you haven't then go see it so you aren't completely lost. Now the ending was absolutely phenomenal. Throughout the entire move I was thinking what the point was and where it was going, but by the end it is so surprising and personally I thought it was unexpected. It makes you appreciate the idea of storytelling and keeping an audience interested and when I watched it a second time it was one of those times when you think, Why didn't I see this coming? I love it when movie do that because it makes me think and if a movie makes me think it means I am interested and it does its job of being a good movie.Overall The Shawshank Redemption is a classic, possibly one of the best of all time. Do I think it deserves number one on IMDb's list? No, absolutely not but it should be in the top 10. A bit of a slow start to an amazing story that connects really well, a cast of characters portrayed in depth and detail, and an ending that will possibly blow your mind all form together to form on of, but not the best, movie of all time and without a shadow of a doubt gets the WillyT seal of approval. See this movie ASAP. ","genre":"Crime, Drama"},{"date":"18 November 2012","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Powerful, hard hitting, provoking, touching. AMX is truly a classic on a controversial social theme. It is one of those movies where the viewer is left stunned when the end credits start rolling and it takes a moment for him to realize that he just viewed a good work of cinema. Though many movies try, but very few leave such an impact on its audience. AMX has this quality.For me, three things stood out in this movie - Direction by Tony Kaye, dialogues (written by David McKenna) and above all, Edward Norton's portrayal of Derek Vinyard. Tony Kaye has been known to come out with work on social themes, his other known work being a documentary on abortion debate, Lake of fire (2006). Through AMX, Tony has depicted the impact of the black-white divide in a very impactful manner. His depiction of the struggle that the youth go through and the impact on their impressionable minds is spot on. But more importantly, he was able to convey the message by building up a story which conveys the impact of this racial hatred on the vineyard family - father's killing, Derek's violence, Danny's death. The sequence of events could have been done sequentially without any voice-over. But having this told by Danny's voice with flashbacks made the story more honest and real. Derek's character transformation inside prison made sense and was not random. Tony was himself the director of photography for AMX. He made sure that the shots which needed impact were done differently - slow motion, face shots. The story\/screenplay is by David McKenna. Since there was no credits given separately for dialogues, am assuming David wrote the dialogues as well. Unlike other movies handling the same theme, I found the dialogues of AMX were much more though provoking & amazingly articulate. The dialogues weren't just swearing and shouting obscenities - they had meaning and made the viewer understand how clear the character's thought process was. This was amply displayed multiple times - Derek's speech to his gang before they busted the departmental store or the lunch table conversation. The same clarity wasn't showed for Danny's character and rightly so - he was simply confused whether to follow his brother's footsteps or be the good family kid.Tony's and Danny's work would have been unreal had Edward Norton not brought Derek's character to life. I would rate this as one of Edward Norton's classic (along with Fight Club). He powerfully portrayed Derek's pre-prison character as an intellectual youth misguided by neo- nazi propaganda. The extremities of his youthful obsession came out beautifully when the cops arrest Derek for the killing of two black youths, but all he does is smile. There is a look of triumph on his face, a sense of pride. Pure hatred, no regret. Overall, AMX is a thought provoking work of cinema which is well written, nicely directed and brought to life by one of the best actors of our generation, Norton. I rate this movie 8.5 out of 10.

Nil By Mouth is reality unfolding, before our very eyes. Ray Winstone gives a ferocious performance as a drug dealer ex parolee, also a heavy boozer, who likes to down a beer after a wine. Unfortunately his boozing leads to his habitual wife bashing. This time around it had devastating consequences. His long suffering wife, (Kathy Burke in a standout performance) has a heroin addict for brother, also an ex parolee (Charlie Creed Miles, who adds another A grade performance to this film). He's totally believable, especially in his desperation for another fix, mostly in scenes where he's having heated arguments with his mother (Oldman's real life sister). The montage song for this, I loved by the way. Nil by Mouth is not a plot driven movie. It's real life, and a kind of situation movie too. It's a movie based on Oldman's background, as a kid, growing up. Ray Winstone, who's got his career back on track after this 1998 film, has become one of my favorite actors. I'm glad he did too, as cinema has missed a movie great for far too long. The first half an hour has Winstone, and his best mate (Jamie Foreman) spinning gags and telling stories that you become involved with, one especially involving one of their mad crim mates. Even later on, after Winstone has gone berserk, tearing up his place, as if a buffalo charged through it, we have a scene with him spilling his sad childhood, about fatherly neglect onto his mate (Jamie Foreman), a patient and supportive listener, as shown in some other scenes as well, the kind of mate, everyone should have. The constant use of expletives, and I use constant with a capital C was true to fact from Oldman's perspective from what I heard. I've never heard a higher use of curses in film. At times the constant expletives become too much, but they're in those intense explosive scenes, Winstone's ones that work for it so darn well. E.g. like where he's trying to get his daughter back, causing a ruckus with other neighbors. You could see this happening anywhere. In life, we have our bad times and good times, one good time, clearly reflected in the last scene where everything's back on an evening keel, and Winstone's re-united with wife and daughter. It's cute, this scene with him, snuggling his daughter. These are moments you cherish and hold onto. It's one of the movie's best scenes. Another one is him, play fighting with his wife's mother, a tough steadfast oldie, who puts up her dukes. She doesn't have a bad singing voice to match, either, we discover. The other scene that's particularly impressive, is Winstone alone, liquored up, calling the wife. When he hangs up, he resumes a conversation, picking up his handset phone again, and banging it many times against it's receiver, while delivering an apologetic conversation, as if his wife (who's bashed face looks like a steamroller went over it) is there. This is followed by him defending himself, blaming the wife. This guy has really been torn in some of the most believable acting I've ever seen. We actually can't help feeling sorry for the guy, in spite of the consequences, prior to his violent acts, one murderous, which is most unforgiving. Winstone is one of those actors, like Ray Liotta, who can play rage and anger with brilliant believability, and also be threatening. Winstone's character is someone you wouldn't want get on their bad side, or meet in a dark alley. But it's Burke as the abused wife that rises above the other performances. That Kevin and Perry crap doesn't do her justice. The most effective NBM moment is near the start, during one of those stories, where Burke in the background, literally shakes for a couple of seconds while rigidly holding a coffee, as if the F words have become all too much, and too, this abuse has been going on for much too long. The bashing scene, where we see Ray's proud shirtless body, as he pounds on his wifee, who by the way is pregnant, will disturb some I imagine as it kind of did me, as he shouts the C word in a succession. One more scene I have to mention, cause I love it, is Charlie Creed Mile's friend, who looks Maori, his arm sporting all of this stuff, scrawled onto it, as if his arm's a blackboard. He recites that trademark Hopper scene in Apocalypse Now, in shouting form. Scenes like this are truly unforgettable. How Oldman got this project off the ground, in terms of script is an oddity. It's rough raw dialogue hardly leaves room for much else, although some of it, true to fact, hits you right in the nose. It's almost as if the actors ad-libbed. I would of loved to have read the written product. But there's no denying that this is a good movie, as it is an important one. Garry Oldman's only written and directed film. Funnily, Winstone went on to star in another controversial film, The War Zone, which was fine actor, Tim Roth's only directed film. Incidentally, some trivia Nil By Mouth hit Adelaide cinemas, on May 21'st, Oldman's 40th birthday. Also the movie was brought back by public demand.

Nil By Mouth is reality unfolding, before our very eyes. Ray Winstone gives a ferocious performance as a drug dealer ex parolee, also a heavy boozer, who likes to down a beer after a wine. Unfortunately his boozing leads to his habitual wife bashing. This time around it had devastating consequences. His long suffering wife, (Kathy Burke in a standout performance) has a heroin addict for brother, also an ex parolee (Charlie Creed Miles, who adds another A grade performance to this film). He's totally believable, especially in his desperation for another fix, mostly in scenes where he's having heated arguments with his mother (Oldman's real life sister). The montage song for this, I loved by the way. Nil by Mouth is not a plot driven movie. It's real life, and a kind of situation movie too. It's a movie based on Oldman's background, as a kid, growing up. Ray Winstone, who's got his career back on track after this 1998 film, has become one of my favorite actors. I'm glad he did too, as cinema has missed a movie great for far too long. The first half an hour has Winstone, and his best mate (Jamie Foreman) spinning gags and telling stories that you become involved with, one especially involving one of their mad crim mates. Even later on, after Winstone has gone berserk, tearing up his place, as if a buffalo charged through it, we have a scene with him spilling his sad childhood, about fatherly neglect onto his mate (Jamie Foreman), a patient and supportive listener, as shown in some other scenes as well, the kind of mate, everyone should have. The constant use of expletives, and I use constant with a capital C was true to fact from Oldman's perspective from what I heard. I've never heard a higher use of curses in film. At times the constant expletives become too much, but they're in those intense explosive scenes, Winstone's ones that work for it so darn well. E.g. like where he's trying to get his daughter back, causing a ruckus with other neighbors. You could see this happening anywhere. In life, we have our bad times and good times, one good time, clearly reflected in the last scene where everything's back on an evening keel, and Winstone's re-united with wife and daughter. It's cute, this scene with him, snuggling his daughter. These are moments you cherish and hold onto. It's one of the movie's best scenes. Another one is him, play fighting with his wife's mother, a tough steadfast oldie, who puts up her dukes. She doesn't have a bad singing voice to match, either, we discover. The other scene that's particularly impressive, is Winstone alone, liquored up, calling the wife. When he hangs up, he resumes a conversation, picking up his handset phone again, and banging it many times against it's receiver, while delivering an apologetic conversation, as if his wife (who's bashed face looks like a steamroller went over it) is there. This is followed by him defending himself, blaming the wife. This guy has really been torn in some of the most believable acting I've ever seen. We actually can't help feeling sorry for the guy, in spite of the consequences, prior to his violent acts, one murderous, which is most unforgiving. Winstone is one of those actors, like Ray Liotta, who can play rage and anger with brilliant believability, and also be threatening. Winstone's character is someone you wouldn't want get on their bad side, or meet in a dark alley. But it's Burke as the abused wife that rises above the other performances. That Kevin and Perry crap doesn't do her justice. The most effective NBM moment is near the start, during one of those stories, where Burke in the background, literally shakes for a couple of seconds while rigidly holding a coffee, as if the F words have become all too much, and too, this abuse has been going on for much too long. The bashing scene, where we see Ray's proud shirtless body, as he pounds on his wifee, who by the way is pregnant, will disturb some I imagine as it kind of did me, as he shouts the C word in a succession. One more scene I have to mention, cause I love it, is Charlie Creed Mile's friend, who looks Maori, his arm sporting all of this stuff, scrawled onto it, as if his arm's a blackboard. He recites that trademark Hopper scene in Apocalypse Now, in shouting form. Scenes like this are truly unforgettable. How Oldman got this project off the ground, in terms of script is an oddity. It's rough raw dialogue hardly leaves room for much else, although some of it, true to fact, hits you right in the nose. It's almost as if the actors ad-libbed. I would of loved to have read the written product. But there's no denying that this is a good movie, as it is an important one. Garry Oldman's only written and directed film. Funnily, Winstone went on to star in another controversial film, The War Zone, which was fine actor, Tim Roth's only directed film. Incidentally, some trivia Nil By Mouth hit Adelaide cinemas, on May 21'st, Oldman's 40th birthday. Also the movie was brought back by public demand.

First, she offers this because she knows she'll win over Mc Murphy, as the patients are too scared, too docile to publicly disagree with her. Then, she offers a second chance without mentioning that she wants the majority among people who can't vote. Finally, she argues that time was over when Mc Murphy succeeded in convincing a tenth patient. She impersonates the institution leading you to think that they care while their only concern is to maintain their domination, their power whatsoever.Here appears the second level a criticism of these mental institutions, answering with authority to people who simply lack the tools to behave like the majority of the population. The only violence the patients show is the one they infringe to themselves. Which leads the only two that see clearly to use it against others, but only for justice McMurphy against the nurse who led Billy to commit suicide, and the Chef against McMurphy to save him from a life of physical and mental imprisonment. A third level deals with love, respect and attitude toward others in general. The main difference between McMurphy and everybody else, patients or institution, is that he treats everyone as equals, and this is what makes him the hero. His humanism is the core quality that will make him play cards with the ones that don't even understand the game (but who will say some of the most intelligent thing when asking how will they win back their money and cigarettes if the nurse keeps them for their own good), speak to the deaf and dumb (who appears to actually fake it), and give an opportunity for love to the one who is supposed to not be able to stand for it.

The humiliation of him not being able to lift the block in the bathroom becomes a message of hope addressed to all of them who knew it was impossible but did not realize that the defeat is in the way they think not the fact that they were right on this matter.

His best scenes are in the car and on the phone and with the bad guys and the worst are with his wife and child and his over reactions with the FBI and police.The Director gives this a good try but again, he seems glaringly out of his element. The action scenes are well done but the suspense and the rhythm of the film seems craggy and out of step. Since then he has honed his abilities and stylish beats and does much better in recent years. But here he is not quite with it when it comes to this type of thing.The bad guys scenes work much better than the family situations both with the kid and with law enforcement types. The plot is overly complex with muddled motivations but moves along quickly enough to make this nothing more than an average feeling man's action movie that has too much fake feeling and not enough edgy action.

See, the same as you got machines that provide different flavors for candies&#x97;strawberry, sherry&#x97;you would also have at your disposal a multitude of characters with their respective situations, hang ups, dirty deals, for every imaginable plot you may concoct and where you can make them fit. So, you put your coin in the slot, press the pertinent button and then you got, say, a quarreling middle age couple which nevertheless love each other dearly. Or two mismatched priests, one of them older, a traditionalist, while the other, a younger one, is going through a crisis of faith. Or you may have also a dignified, mature, married couple who have been together for 30 years and which is going somewhere to visit their grandchildren. So, after having spent barely a dozen quarters, at a cost of $3.00, what you'll have in your hands is the script for your next flick, the only thing left for you to do is to give it to your writers so they put some order in it. I'm not saying that this is how TPA was done, after all it's based on a novel I gather, but it certainly looks that way. So, until the ship hits the iceb...Ops; until the wave hits the Poseidon, what we are offered here is a lame parade of two-legged clichés and I would even add, some nasty ethnic stereotypes thrown in for the variety--specially the uber villainous company man who just happens to be Greek and who'll play the Ismay of this tragedy.Already the initial alcove scene between Bornigne and Stevens indicates that this would be a mediocre flick and that the writing would be lousy&#x97;in what universe could be considered smart, funny the idea of a cop repeatedly booking a prostitute just to keep her off the streets until he can marry her? But also that the acting would go from barely passable to rotten, of which Bornigne, again, gives a prime example&#x97;what a ham this man can be!--and that the plot would be simply lame. In reminded me of those Chinese TV games where players have to run through a series of diverse obstacles&#x97;rings of fire, holes that change shapes, pools of water, etc. Because that's the whole story, nothing else, a simple race of obstacles. And, oh pull-heeze, don't tell me that there's a lot of symbolism here&#x97;that of the Christmas tree, the preacher leading the faithful to salvation, the Jewish lady saving the life of the Christian, etc&#x97;that a movie can be full loaded with metaphors and still be a turkey. Metaphors don't make masterpieces of movies by themselves; excellence has to be present all over, in the plot, the acting, the mood, and the score.Speaking of mood, TPA doesn't have any simply because it's just too obvious the attempt by the filmmakers at manipulating your emotions. Ever scene contains elements that target your waterworks in one way or another and if you are not caught napping, it all will come out sappy, corny and lame. Why couldn't be all survivors rescued at the end, what was so impossible about that? Nothing, but that certainly wouldn't have made shed any tears to the most sensible souls. And why all the idiotic disputes about some people wanting to go DOWN!? And they didn't forget either the lecherous older ones amongst us, as every one geezer here, or almost, got some leggy, hot-pantied, spring chicken clinging to him. Lucky also, as by a fortunate coincidence both PSM and Linley were wearing hot pants, and Stevens only panties, when the disaster happens, which gives occasion for some juicy camera angles and vistas. Wow. Now, what I really found funny is the references to Nielsen&#x97;which presence induced younger viewers to think this was a comedy. The truth is, he was then a serious dramatic actor who just happened to drift into comedy. I recall seeing him for the first time in the very straight TV drama Peyton Place along a very young Ryan O'Neill and a kid called Mia Farrow. I think the real tragedy was in not keeping him in the plot, having him along for the ride playing the opposite to the rebellious preacher--man of action Scott rather than a pathetically clownish Bornigne. (Didn't his man watch himself in Flight of the Phoenix, which should have told him that kind of role wasn't becoming for him?).Oh, and the physics of the flick are all wrong. The outside shots show the ship mostly underwater but still with some buoyancy, as it doesn't fall to the bottom. In that situation the only thing that can have given it that buoyancy is the air trapped in it, as only two things are then possible either the water fills the hull and the ship goes down fast, or the air entrapped keeps it afloat, but at the cost of an enormous pressure. That's the situation in the movie, the whole ship hanging from the air pockets in the hull. So, as its entire weight, say 50.000 tons., is resting on that compressed air, the pressure on the survivors should have being incredible, impossible to resist, enough to kill them in a moment. Now, it's true that the fires inside the hull take some air and diminish the pressure, but that makes the water go up, the ship descends, to restore it, so they produce no change in pressure after all.In all, just keep it for a rainy winter afternoon, only if you have nothing, absolutely nothing to do. 5\/10, 2 for the F\/X and one for the three hot leggy ladies.
