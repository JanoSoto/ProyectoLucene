And those viewers should know that E.R.  has always made a priority of being medically  accurate.DEEP IMPACT begins with a newspaper reporter  on the trail of what she thinks is a juicy  piece of scandal in Washington &#150; possibly  involving the President himself.  To her  horror, she's abducted by the FBI and  brought before the President.  But rather  than being thrown into prison, she's told  that, if she behaves herself, she can come  to a Presidential press conference and ask  the first question.  When she asks that  question and gets her answer, she finds out  that her juicy piece of scandal is really an  impending global disaster -- a comet on a  collision course with Earth.  If it hits,  it'll blast enough dust into the atmosphere  to block the sun's heat and light for a good  long time, which will tend to make staying  alive rather difficult.A team of astronauts is sent into space to  try and destroy the comet.  And in this movie,  they send up REAL astronauts, not a bunch of  oil drillers who've never even been trained  for  space flight.  Everything these guys do  up there looks like real documentary footage,  not like a battle scene from STAR WARS.   Back on Earth, one million people are  selected to go into shelters, in case the  comet can't be stopped.  Some of them are  selected based on their qualifications, the  rest are picked at random, although no one  over 50 gets to be in the random drawing.The general public is told about all this,  and about the status of the mission to destroy  the comet, by the President and other authorities  in a series of messages delivered on national  television.  These television broadcasts are  another ingredient that adds realism to the  story.Unfortunately, the general public's reaction  is not quite so realistic.  We're supposed  to believe everybody would stand by quietly  and obey orders &#150; that the masses would  simply stand at the entrance to the shelter  and look on longingly as the chosen ones  went inside.  More likely, there would be  a lot of violent protest from those who felt  THEY should have been chosen, or someone else  shouldn't have been.   This is one of several  lapses in credibility that make DEEP IMPACT  less effective than it might be.  Another  one is a fellow searching for his girlfriend  among the mobs attempting to flee the disaster,  and finding her almost immediately.

Everything these guys do  up there looks like real documentary footage,  not like a battle scene from STAR WARS.   Back on Earth, one million people are  selected to go into shelters, in case the  comet can't be stopped.  Some of them are  selected based on their qualifications, the  rest are picked at random, although no one  over 50 gets to be in the random drawing.The general public is told about all this,  and about the status of the mission to destroy  the comet, by the President and other authorities  in a series of messages delivered on national  television.  These television broadcasts are  another ingredient that adds realism to the  story.Unfortunately, the general public's reaction  is not quite so realistic.  We're supposed  to believe everybody would stand by quietly  and obey orders &#150; that the masses would  simply stand at the entrance to the shelter  and look on longingly as the chosen ones  went inside.  More likely, there would be  a lot of violent protest from those who felt  THEY should have been chosen, or someone else  shouldn't have been.   This is one of several  lapses in credibility that make DEEP IMPACT  less effective than it might be.  Another  one is a fellow searching for his girlfriend  among the mobs attempting to flee the disaster,  and finding her almost immediately.   A third one is less obvious, but if you've  read LUCIFER'S HAMMER, the definitive  comet-strike novel, you can't miss it.   If something that big hits the ocean going  that fast, it won't just cause a tidal wave.   It'll flash-boil the water and make it  rain &#150; and rain, and rain, and rain.   Interestingly enough, this was one thing  ARMAGEDDON got right.I still recommend DEEP IMPACT, though, if  you want a look at how this disaster really  might look, rather than just a fun time.Now if only someone would make a movie  out of LUCIFER'S HAMMER.

Psycho (1998) not only is a technical masterpiece but is also very well acted and possibly even better acted than the original. Each actor in the film does their best to make the character their own as it would have been more of an insult if they'd imitated the original actors.Vince Vaughn was never supposed to be like Anthony Perkins' Norman Bates. He is genuinely creepy in this role and does a fantastic job. Julinanne Moore also shows how good an actor she really is by giving her character a totally different presence in the film compared to Vera Miles' performance. Anne Heche and Viggo Mortensen are also good leaving William H. Macy who seems to be the most out of place.Psycho manages to translate well to the 90's as when I saw this film, I had seen the original along with a friend on the left side of me. While another friend of the right hand side who hadn't seen the original was terrified and thought it was fantastic. It seems the only thing people have against this film is that it still actually is Psycho. If Gus Van Sant had made this film a modern slasher, it would have lost all credibility. Van Sant pays tribute to the original film by keeping it exactly how it is and should be.So with improved acting, up to date technology, this is an interesting way of taking a modern look at a classic. Hearing the score in digital sound was brilliant and the shower scene still packs a punch with those more realistic stabbing sound effects. This film is not a bad movie, it's just different to anything we've seen before. I thought A Perfect Murder was a very poor take on Dial M for Murder yet that film got away with it.People are forgetting about the 'Psycho remake bashing' that took place when the film was released and are now watching the film with an open mind on video and DVD.

There are of course a few fighting scenes, which by the way are not memorable. Further they are a few comedic element, but either they are too goofy or they are not so funny that you roll out on the floor laughing. These two &#145;failures' of the film then show you how &#145;bad' the script actually is and that was it, for my hope to watch a good film.

Have since the first time I saw it! Sure... some may classify it as simply a feel-good movie, but what's wrong with that?  Some may also classify it as pure schmaltz, but the movie truly does have it's sad points... like the priceless look on General Waverly's face whenever he enters the room where everyone who had been under his division is awaiting his arrival!The movie has a truly wonderful musical score, not to mention some VERY kick butt dancing!Bing Crosby is charming as Bob Wallace, a calm and reserved, yet witty and delightful and wise-cracking, and somewhat cynical kind of guy. Bing truly performed to his greatest.  And his vocal talent is enormous, not to mention evident throughout the entire movie!  It's a real treat to see him crack up when he and Danny Kaye are performing their rendition of Sisters!Danny Kaye is hilarious as Phil Davis, the foil to calm and cool Bob. Phil, too, is full of wise-cracks, and very intent on getting Bob to settle down. Danny gave such a life to his character, portraying him like no other! His best one liner was when a young blonde with voice like nails on a chalk board says to him (after his phoney engagment to Judy) I sure wish it would happen to me!) to which he replies So do I!Rosemary Clooney is absolutely riveting as Betty Haynes, the older of the two Haynes sisters.  She is the most calm and most subdued.  She is looking for her knight on the white horse in life.  Rosemary played Betty to the fullest, making her every bit as believable as you could imagine!  And that voice... GOLDEN!  A gift from God!  It's a true treasure to see her in her solo Love (You Didn't Do Right By Me).  She's absolutely marvelous and extremely talented.Vera-Ellen is refreshingly delightful as Judy Haynes, the younger and more naive Haynes sister.  Judy is also the dreamer of the two.  Vera-Ellen does a wonderfully through job of portraying Judy!  She is a perfect foil to her older sister.  And those dancing stems... to see her dance in numbers like Mandy and Choreography is a real treat!  How ANYONE could ever dance as well as she is beyond me!  She really did a great job in this movie, even better than her performance in On The Town with Gene Kelly, Frank Sinatra and Betty Garrett.A GREAT MOVIE!!!!  GREAT CAST CHEMISTRY!!!!  GREAT MUSIC!!!!  GREAT DANCING!!!!  WATCH IT AND YOU WILL SOON BE DREAMING OF A WHITE CHRISTMAS!!!!
