Those who closely followed the television series Taxi remember the character of Latka Gravas, but how many people paid any attention to Kaufman's offscreen antics? Those who did notice generally seem to fall into one of two categories those who loved Kaufman and believed him to be an unsung comic genius, and those who despised him and saw him as a relentlessly weird pathological  liar.Those who loved Kaufman and his work might find something of value in this film. As a straight biography, there are inspired, original moments - such as the beginning acting as an end, or some of Kaufman's bits (including the legendary Saturday Night Live Mighty Mouse skit) - but most of the movie is rather pedestrian, given that it's directed by Milos Forman, who brought One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest to the big screen.

As Andy, Carrey turns in a good impersonation, but not a full characterization. Courtney Love as Andy's girlfriend Lynne isn't exceptional, but the character lacks depth. She's no more or less important than Adrian from Rocky, cheering her man on through thick and thin, leaving him at one point but - surprise - coming back to him when he needs her the most.

","genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance"},{"date":"31 May 2000","score":"1 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":"  It seems that no matter what Tom Cruise touches turns to gold. He's just one of those actors that has such a commanding and irrepressible screen presence that even if a film is otherwise crap, it's still pretty good as long as he's in it. Witness Cocktail!!Jerry Maguire however is nowhere near being that heavy piece of luggage that Cruise alone must carry to bring it salvation. It's a strong ensemble piece with accurate insights into the cynicism of the sports world and the soul searching mission of one man who must break free and live free in order to attain redemption from this world. The plot is about Jerry Maguire (Cruise) who thinks the world is his oyster and thinks that everybody loves him until he gets fired for speaking his mind about the need to start caring for his clients. Cruise loses everything except the feisty, seemingly average wide receiver Tidwell(Gooding Jr.) and a loyal employee Dorothy (Zellwegger)who embraces the same ideals as Maguire and accompanies him on this trek of redemption.I must admit that Jerry Maguire is not an Oscar worthy picture in the cinematic sense; it is as entertaining and oftentimes as moving as anything you may have seen but 5 Oscar nominations raises a few eyebrows. I suppose every year Hollywood needs to recognize a film that lives by the credo 'Everything may seem bad at the outset but there is light at the end of the tunnel and if you are true to yourself you will invariably succeed'. Maguire lives by this credo and audiences consequently loved it because Cruise reigns supreme at the end and as always, we love the guy!The first 1\/2 of the film is particularly insightful and well presented. Cruise feels suffocated by the hypocisy of the world he lives in and needs to escape otherwise his soul will be devoured by the forces around him. We see ugly side of endorsements and promotions, the clash between money and loyalty (in fact there is no clash, money always is the bottom line!!) and greed and backstabbing that lies at the very heart of this world. Jerry Maguire is a metaphor not only resigned to the sports world, but to any competitive environment where only the fittest can survive!! Of course in the real world, the happy endings are few and far between, but what the hell!!! Cruise needs to exert real emotion into his role without tiring the audience. The movie is long and Cruise undergoes significant metamorphosis which will test the audiences patience and endurance. Some may become annoyed by Cruise who puts so much heart into this role that he sometimes completely over-acts and outdoes himself. Others will recognize that Cruise is still a young actor and is still learning, and therefore we should admire him for the committment he's given the role. And he sure is committed!!! He has to play the cold cynic, the ostracized has-been, the real nobody, the loser, the comeback kid, the romantic lover, and ultimately the victor all in one film. This is a tougher task than he may be given credit for.Cuba Gooding Jr, who won the oscar for best supporting actor, is the money-obsessed, second-rate hot head athlete that Maguire must transform in order for him to realize his full potential. Gooding like Cruise plays the chracater with a refershingly endearing streak that does so much to keep the film moving at the proper momentum. At the heart of his character is a man also searching for his identity. We see that he's man who is passionate about his wife and children but lacks heart when it comes to performing. Cruise must help him discover this. The chemistry between the two is explosive; they are together, onboard a ship without a destination. And they must navigate the ship otherwise they will be stuck at sea forever. Their plight is very convincing because we gradually see how fragile the two men are. At the outset we are introduced to two bad-ass contenders but as developments occur, the two men's weaknesses are exposed and they must find the inner strength and power of love to keep them afloat.Rene Zellwegger is a newcomer who is Cruises partner come love interest. Her charm and the warmth she brings to the screen cannot be ignored. She is vital to the film because she is so integral to the evolution of the central character. She need to be a good actress otherwise Cruise's performance is indirectly affected. If she cannot convince us, then Cruise's job becomes impossible. Gooding and Zellwegger are carrying Cruise on their shoulders. If they are not strong enough to sustain the weight, then the whole thing falls apart like a house of cards. Zellwegger has extra baggage in the form of her son Ray (Lipnicki), a kid with the most incredibly cute, awesome screen presence. It is so powerful that he steals each scene he is in and we are left begging for more from him. Cruise's attachment to the boy is the catalyst to the evolution of his relationship with the mother. As time goes on, we see Cruise marry Zellwegger because he doesn't want to lose the kid and not bacaue he fully loves her. This leads to an eventual painstaking conflict between the married couple who begin to fear that there is no hope for people like them. Cruise asks What do you want from me, my soul? to which Zellwegger replies Why not, I desrve that! It is a meaningful and moving scene as the two start to realize their marraige was a mistake. It is a saddening yet ironically identifiable moment. Cruise and Zellwegger are two good people in a world polluted by bad seeds. They should be perfect for one another because they both believe in the same things but the conflicts that surround them are just too apparent. It will take more than that for it to work and Cruise must search the pit of his soul to get it. His body language when he's around her exercises tremendous potential on his part as an actor. He seems so uncomfortable around her, whereas she is so keen to keep him close. It is a conflict that makes the audience feels uncomfortable. Back to Lipnicki,he needs to be convincing enough within limited screen time to turn Cruise's world upside down. And he does thereby intensifying the conflicts that envelop Cruise. Even love makes Cruise more confused. This is a strong ironic touch and we can easily identify with it. What's it's trying to tell us is even the good things in life can be detrimental if you don't fully believe in them. Cruise doesn't believe he can love so the confusion mounts.Side characters like malicious,venom-spitting rival agent Jay Mohr and ex-fiancee Kelly Preston give sound performances which manifest the horrible face of the environment that Cruise wishes to detach from. Of course their self-interest and killer instincts run counter to Cruise and we really do hate them. This makes Cruises comeback all the more popular with us because we want him to make them look silly. Bonnie Hunt plays Zellwegger's cynical (endearingly cynical) sister who vehemently opposes her sisters relationship because she thinks to know how it's all gonna end. She has been down the road that Gooding, Zellwegger, and Cruise are experiencing now and she fears it will all end in heartbreak. She is a very good actress with good screen presence and has always proved invaluable to the films she starred in.Cameron Crowe wrote and directed this film and although we don't get to see exceptional cinematography, his job proves very successful. The film could have been a flop had the cast been different. I say this because there are bits that go on for too long. It seems that Crowe knows where the film should have been cut but seems to have been more content to work the stretch and exhaust the audience with superfluous dialogue and scenes. His intention was to get maximum emotional effect from the audience but we often teeter on impatience and frustration.

He's just one of those actors that has such a commanding and irrepressible screen presence that even if a film is otherwise crap, it's still pretty good as long as he's in it. Witness Cocktail!!Jerry Maguire however is nowhere near being that heavy piece of luggage that Cruise alone must carry to bring it salvation. It's a strong ensemble piece with accurate insights into the cynicism of the sports world and the soul searching mission of one man who must break free and live free in order to attain redemption from this world. The plot is about Jerry Maguire (Cruise) who thinks the world is his oyster and thinks that everybody loves him until he gets fired for speaking his mind about the need to start caring for his clients. Cruise loses everything except the feisty, seemingly average wide receiver Tidwell(Gooding Jr.) and a loyal employee Dorothy (Zellwegger)who embraces the same ideals as Maguire and accompanies him on this trek of redemption.I must admit that Jerry Maguire is not an Oscar worthy picture in the cinematic sense; it is as entertaining and oftentimes as moving as anything you may have seen but 5 Oscar nominations raises a few eyebrows. I suppose every year Hollywood needs to recognize a film that lives by the credo 'Everything may seem bad at the outset but there is light at the end of the tunnel and if you are true to yourself you will invariably succeed'. Maguire lives by this credo and audiences consequently loved it because Cruise reigns supreme at the end and as always, we love the guy!The first 1\/2 of the film is particularly insightful and well presented. Cruise feels suffocated by the hypocisy of the world he lives in and needs to escape otherwise his soul will be devoured by the forces around him. We see ugly side of endorsements and promotions, the clash between money and loyalty (in fact there is no clash, money always is the bottom line!!) and greed and backstabbing that lies at the very heart of this world. Jerry Maguire is a metaphor not only resigned to the sports world, but to any competitive environment where only the fittest can survive!! Of course in the real world, the happy endings are few and far between, but what the hell!!! Cruise needs to exert real emotion into his role without tiring the audience. The movie is long and Cruise undergoes significant metamorphosis which will test the audiences patience and endurance. Some may become annoyed by Cruise who puts so much heart into this role that he sometimes completely over-acts and outdoes himself. Others will recognize that Cruise is still a young actor and is still learning, and therefore we should admire him for the committment he's given the role. And he sure is committed!!! He has to play the cold cynic, the ostracized has-been, the real nobody, the loser, the comeback kid, the romantic lover, and ultimately the victor all in one film. This is a tougher task than he may be given credit for.Cuba Gooding Jr, who won the oscar for best supporting actor, is the money-obsessed, second-rate hot head athlete that Maguire must transform in order for him to realize his full potential. Gooding like Cruise plays the chracater with a refershingly endearing streak that does so much to keep the film moving at the proper momentum. At the heart of his character is a man also searching for his identity. We see that he's man who is passionate about his wife and children but lacks heart when it comes to performing. Cruise must help him discover this. The chemistry between the two is explosive; they are together, onboard a ship without a destination. And they must navigate the ship otherwise they will be stuck at sea forever. Their plight is very convincing because we gradually see how fragile the two men are. At the outset we are introduced to two bad-ass contenders but as developments occur, the two men's weaknesses are exposed and they must find the inner strength and power of love to keep them afloat.Rene Zellwegger is a newcomer who is Cruises partner come love interest. Her charm and the warmth she brings to the screen cannot be ignored. She is vital to the film because she is so integral to the evolution of the central character. She need to be a good actress otherwise Cruise's performance is indirectly affected. If she cannot convince us, then Cruise's job becomes impossible. Gooding and Zellwegger are carrying Cruise on their shoulders. If they are not strong enough to sustain the weight, then the whole thing falls apart like a house of cards. Zellwegger has extra baggage in the form of her son Ray (Lipnicki), a kid with the most incredibly cute, awesome screen presence. It is so powerful that he steals each scene he is in and we are left begging for more from him. Cruise's attachment to the boy is the catalyst to the evolution of his relationship with the mother. As time goes on, we see Cruise marry Zellwegger because he doesn't want to lose the kid and not bacaue he fully loves her. This leads to an eventual painstaking conflict between the married couple who begin to fear that there is no hope for people like them. Cruise asks What do you want from me, my soul? to which Zellwegger replies Why not, I desrve that! It is a meaningful and moving scene as the two start to realize their marraige was a mistake. It is a saddening yet ironically identifiable moment. Cruise and Zellwegger are two good people in a world polluted by bad seeds. They should be perfect for one another because they both believe in the same things but the conflicts that surround them are just too apparent. It will take more than that for it to work and Cruise must search the pit of his soul to get it. His body language when he's around her exercises tremendous potential on his part as an actor. He seems so uncomfortable around her, whereas she is so keen to keep him close. It is a conflict that makes the audience feels uncomfortable. Back to Lipnicki,he needs to be convincing enough within limited screen time to turn Cruise's world upside down. And he does thereby intensifying the conflicts that envelop Cruise. Even love makes Cruise more confused. This is a strong ironic touch and we can easily identify with it. What's it's trying to tell us is even the good things in life can be detrimental if you don't fully believe in them. Cruise doesn't believe he can love so the confusion mounts.Side characters like malicious,venom-spitting rival agent Jay Mohr and ex-fiancee Kelly Preston give sound performances which manifest the horrible face of the environment that Cruise wishes to detach from. Of course their self-interest and killer instincts run counter to Cruise and we really do hate them. This makes Cruises comeback all the more popular with us because we want him to make them look silly. Bonnie Hunt plays Zellwegger's cynical (endearingly cynical) sister who vehemently opposes her sisters relationship because she thinks to know how it's all gonna end. She has been down the road that Gooding, Zellwegger, and Cruise are experiencing now and she fears it will all end in heartbreak. She is a very good actress with good screen presence and has always proved invaluable to the films she starred in.Cameron Crowe wrote and directed this film and although we don't get to see exceptional cinematography, his job proves very successful. The film could have been a flop had the cast been different. I say this because there are bits that go on for too long. It seems that Crowe knows where the film should have been cut but seems to have been more content to work the stretch and exhaust the audience with superfluous dialogue and scenes. His intention was to get maximum emotional effect from the audience but we often teeter on impatience and frustration.

First of all it shows us a side of USA which is always hidden or ignored in the flow of mainstream American movies. It shows us the underbelly of society The outcast. It is a brave and honest portrayal of what goes on in the streets of Portland, and in every large city in modern society. Except for one film (pretty boy, a Danish movie), this is the only film I know that tells us about the lives of hustlers (young, male prostitutes). And what makes MOPI unique, is that Gus Van Sant describes them in a nonjudgemental, caring way Not gloryfying them or their sad lives, not preaching moral on their lifestyle, not trying to make a political statement. Another thing that makes MOPI a very special movie, is the surreal way the story is told. Mike, the main character, is a hustler who lives on the streets. But Mike suffers from a strange disease which makes him fall asleep at the most inaproppriate moments, because it's caused by stress. And because the film is seen through his sleepy eyes, we are always uncertain exactly where we are and what is going on. In glimpses we see his dreams of a long lost mother, pictures of salmons swimming up current, and desolate landscapes. You'd might think that the harsh environment and surreal filming makes it impossible for you to connect and empathize with the characters. I did not think so. Though MOPI deals with some pretty heavy things, as for example prostitution and drug abuse, this is just as much a film about the search for love, which we all can relate to. Mike, the main character (fabulously played by River Phoenix), is always searching for love an acceptance, partly from his best friend Scott, but also from his father\/brother and the dream of his mother, whom he have never known. Both Mike and Scott, who are best friends and the main characters of the movie, are looking for love and true relations. But both come from families which has never given them love. Scott, a mayor's son, has run away because his father was not able to accept and love him. Mike's family is dissolved and depraved Mike being the son of his mother and his own brother. In the streets both kids find a new family, a family of hustlers and junkies. And the two become best friends. But unfortunately this new family will also fail to give them the security and love they need. To me the story is not the most important thing What touched me the most was the touching and compassionate portrayal of Mike, a frail and vulnerable boy. River Phoenix is amazing in this role. With raw honesty, he strips away all defenses and shows us a young man, who is deeply wounded and always looking for love and accept, but never getting it.

Okay, so the movie shows US some of the dead people.  Yes, it may make you jump in a couple of places, but that doesn't define a thriller.  I can sneak up behind a person and yell in his ear and make him flinch; that doesn't make me the master of suspense.By and large, the genuine creepiness that DOES take place in this movie is effective, but sparse and short-lived.  And since we already know about the dead people, there really isn't much left for the audience, except for one thing.***SPOILER WARNING***The writer did leave himself an ace in the hole.  The problem is that it's almost completely given away by the end of the movie, to folks with a keen eye and sharp senses.Everybody I knew that saw this movie before I did said oh, man, it's great, you've gotta see it, the ending will blow your mind, etc.  I started watching the movie.  Bruce Willis gets shot, and about twenty minutes later, since the shooting itself had not been brought up at all in the film since it took place, I started asking myself okay, it was significant that the underwear-wearing guy in the bathroom blew his brains out... but that alone would have sealed the doctor's motivation for wanting to help this kid.  So why did the doctor have to get shot?  Simple answer so we can all find out at the end that he's already dead. Duh. Of course, that early in the film, it's only a hypothesis.  When the big secret is finally revealed, however, you've got so much evidence to support your theory packed into your head that there's no way you CAN'T be right. And, as it turns out, you ARE right.  It's a surprise ending that fails to be a surprise.  Therefore, for me, there was nothing interesting about this film in terms of story. And quite frankly, I wasn't too interested in the whole I see dead people concept to begin with.If you want to see a movie with an EFFECTIVE sucker-punch ending, try The Usual Suspects or Fight Club.

I can't wait to go the 3rd time. Being a huge fan of John Woo films, this one really hits the mark.  Sure the plot is simple but John Woo makes a great movie by not following the first one where nobody can understand the plot even if it existed at all?  But what more do you want....its a fun movie, Tom Cruise is trying to save the world, lets keep it simple and not try to continue ruin the franchise by making it like the first one.  Sure, this won't top his Hong Kong flicks such masterpieces like Hard-Boiled and The Killer.  However, I would put this movie right up there with Face\/Off.  Face\/Off has a great story and great action and it really introduced John Woo to the world.  However with MI2, the John Woo trademarks really stood out with his stylish slow motion effects to capture all its action in its intensity.  Tom Cruise never looked better.  When you work with John Woo, he turns you into a hero....an action hero! Everything is great about this movie.  The right amount of action, it was so good that you just don't want it to end.  Most people might think that the John Woo trademarks are slightly over done, but some may find it very cool and stylish.  No director is the same.  Everybody has got their own style. This is a must see for the summer and a great way to start off the summer. This movie will no doubtedly pass the 100 million mark in less than 2 weeks.......quite amazing I must say!   MI2 is a masterpiece and a milestone in film making.  Many people groan at the style of this John Woo film but its only because they don't know how to appreciate quality and original film-making.  Thats why its labeled a John Woo film.  This is for sure a film that critics will bash, but that only means its going to be a great movie.  You see, many people are just WAY TOO critical about movies, thats why they have problems enjoying movies.  Word of advice to the people who don't think they'll enjoy this movie or didn't enjoy it......watch the first MI movie, you'll like the second one even more.  Its all there, user-friendly plot (easy to understand),  breath-taking stunts, great camera work, stylish film-making, ultra cool action sequences, Tom Cruise never looked so cool.

I saw 'Clerks' after a friend recommended it to me, and I found a copy second-hand.  I then saw 'Mallrats', 'Dogma' and 'Chasing Amy' which was the last of the Smith films I saw.  Being a lesbian myself, I was excited at the prospect of seeing Smith tackle a subject which is so close to my heart.  Rather than scream how brilliant this movie is, I'll explain my thoughts and feelings towards the film, speaking as a lesbian.I guess my first impression of the movie was that the cult repetition, such as the girl dying in the pool, 'Star Wars', ice hockey etc., etc., seemed a little self-conscious.  In the other movies the beauty and humour of the repetition was that it was natural, but I felt that it seemed slightly unnatural and out of context here.Secondly, I found the character of Allysa totally unconvincing as a lesbian; she slated lipstick lesbians often, but failed to realise that she herself was one.  While jokes like Hey, since you like chicks, do you ever look in the mirror naked? where juvenile, as were the continuous shots of girl-on-girl action (which was utterly gratuitous and unnatural, however - it is something which is rarely shown in the cinema, and is therefore a good thing, bad representation is better than no representation).  I disliked the stereotypes of gay people - saying that they all stick together in little dark clubs, and the fact that Allysa's friends reject her when she finally 'meets the right boy'.  I prefer the company of straight people, and I doubt they'd judge if I fell for a man. Don't get me wrong, I did enjoy this movie a lot, but this needs to be said.This film is purely a 'curing fantasy' for boys - this girl was never gay in the first place, and was cured once she was screwed by the right man. When Ben Affleck's character puts this to her, she hits him playfully with a pillow and giggles.... eugh!Although I have a strong dislike for much of 'Chasing Amy's concepts and representations, there were some parts which I strongly related to.  The parts that really stick in my mind are the parts were Alyssa goes into yelling-overdrive in the rain.  I can relate to her feeling trapped and confused and angry and scared - she knows that it will all end in tears but her feelings are so confused that she cannot help herself - she knows it is happening and she cannot stop it.  I guess it's an aspect of gay life which which is often overlooked; we're not all professional queers who know what we want and how to get it. This is more thanks to Smith's writing than his casting.I think the funniest line was this you're banging away, not noticing the bored look in her eye... to which he replies, Not at all!  I always notice that bored look in their eyes.  and the part (not ruining the plot) in the penultimate scene when Banky leans into his hands and yells Oh thank God!!!.  I also liked the part where Allysa sings a song in the club, and Holden thinks that she is singing to him, only to watch her fall into the arms of a woman at the end of the song (much to Banky's amusement!)

The action was there, as was the clichéd storyline, although Chris Tucker as a co-star did not necessarily appeal to me;  I don't find 26-year-olds acting as if they were in their teenage years particularly amusing.Thus, it was with some skepticism that I went to watch Shanghai Noon after hearing that Chan would once again be paired with an American actor.  I expected big action and excruciatingly tedious interactions between the two main leads, but was oddly enough provided with the opposite impression.The highlight of this film comes in the form of Chan's and Wilson's complementary roles.  Wilson plays the part of the outspoken, wild cowboy, while Chan opts to convey his feelings through action, following his typical style--an homage to the great silent classics of the past.  Wilson's wit is subtle enough to highlight the talents of Chan, and what Wilson himself does not possess, Chan brings out in him through what he has to offer to the silver screen.  It's a rather remarkable accomplishment, which in several scenes creates a somewhat touching spectacle.So where does the film falter?  Most of the action scenes are really inspired, and feature ingenious uses of ordinary items such as trees or ropes, but there is one main difference between the two actors  one is a cowboy, the other a martial artist.  As a result, all of the conflicts in the story when the two characters are present consist of different enemies--a gun-rearing adversary for Wilson, and a martial artist or hand-fighting foe for Chan.  In these moments, the film separates the two characters and leads them to different environments, which detaches the viewer to the point where it becomes painfully obvious that there is no real main conflict it is simply two characters fighting a motley crew of random enemies.The detachment provided by these scenes often leads the viewer to find something else to draw themselves into the film with;  as a result, the performance of Wilson -slightly- steals the show for the majority of the story.  The director obviously attempts to balance this out by adding emotive scenes in which the two characters bond to a certain extent, though by the end of the film one tends to recall more about Wilson's acting than Chan's feats, which is quite a shame.Chan is growing older, and as a result is more restricted to the style of stunts that he can accomplish without heavily jeopardizing his life.  Yet this film remains his strongest American attempt thus far, and features some astounding scenery with a wonderful orchestral accompaniment.

Now don't get me wrong; I am a very emotional person, and this story just hit me.  I believe that was James Cameron's intent when he wrote it.  He knew just what to write, and when and how to write it.The movie had it's flaws, yes.  I incredibly disliked the story with older Rose and believed that it would add to the suspense, surprise and story if it had just started out back in 1912 and was just the disaster story, and not the whole other story.  The old Rose part is pointless and just an extra half-hour to fast forward through.  Someone did make a good point in an earlier comment also, about the fact that old Rose is narrating the story, yet she manages to know all about other things that had nothing to do with her or things that came as a surprise to her.However flawed the movie is, however, it makes up for it with it's effect. Many people criticize the love story, but I believe that it was needed in order for the viewer to actually *get* the movie.  By knowing the ship was doomed, we knew the characters were doomed, and it forced the feeling of wanting them to survive by any means.  Call me sensitive, but I felt for Jack and Rose and pulled for them the entire time.Now, three years later, sometimes I will sit down to watch the epic (after fast forwarding the first half-hour).  Some parts I now find cheesy or boring, but it could be due to the fact that I've seen the movie so many times.  I definitely believe the movie deserved the Oscars it won.  It may be flawed or hated, but the Titanic phenomenon hit people like no other movie has done before.  It was a gamble by Cameron, and it won.  Those who truly appreciate it enjoy it, and those who can't see past Leo or computer effects (and believe me, Star Wars has those effects, too) just aren't as lucky as those of us who can and have and are able to truly enjoy the movie.An epic of Titanic proportions, and worthy of my appreciation.

Those who truly appreciate it enjoy it, and those who can't see past Leo or computer effects (and believe me, Star Wars has those effects, too) just aren't as lucky as those of us who can and have and are able to truly enjoy the movie.An epic of Titanic proportions, and worthy of my appreciation.

This movie is definately gory and filled with blood and organs galore, but not in the normal sense. It is meant to be funny, and believe me, if you can honestly watch this movie and not see Peter Jackson's great black humor shining through, then you need to go rent Mary Poppins.

It's cut by about 15 mins... I've seen all three versions of this film (the R-rated and Unrated US ones, titled Dead-Alive, and the original one, titled Braindead, as well) and must say that if you can get your hands on a good copy of the original, it is definately worth it! If not, the Unrated US version is only a few minutes shorter (as far as I noticed, the only thing missing was the scene where Spike gets loose at the beginning of the final party, and is subdued when Lionel pours a bottle of JD down his throat before he tears someone else's out... really funny, but no huge loss...) and a HECK of a lot easier to find. But, as i said before, STAY AWAY FROM THE R-RATED US VERSION AT ALL COSTS!!! Also check out Jackson's previous films Meet the Feebles, and Bad Taste. The first is a hilarious social commentary done with all puppets (just imagine the Muppets on crack mixed with an awful daytime soap opera), and the latter is about aliens who come to earth to capture humans to sell at their outerspace fast food joints.

If this had been the only Godfather ever released, it might have been up for the academy award. That's all on its own; particularly as it was a 1990 film, and films were starting to get a tad weaker, in general, by that point.But it a) must not necessarily be seen as a sequel to the Godfather, and b) it might be seen as the most 'operatic' or Shakespearian of the bunch. It's not the sequel because it's no longer really the Puzo series, and the characters seem a bit different. The Godfather characters are sort of borrowed for this film, you could say. And I thought of classic drama and opera as soon as the assassin was introduced. He's sort of Shakespeare's simultaneously clumsy and comical competent killer.What gets weird is the Vatican Bank story leeching into the election of JP I. We are to believe that Don Corleone has a private confession with the cardinal before he is elected Pope; and of course, the Don in short order goes ahead and orders the purge of assorted gangsters, just like he did in the previous film. But . . . And we are further to believe that an archbishop conspirator in the scandal literally poisoned the tea of JP I, and killed him. Now the poison in the drink is also the stuff of classic drama. And I'd take it for that. But as history, it seems laughable. Don Michael's order in the movie end purge literally includes this evil renegade archbishop, to the point of having some gunman lurking in the shadows shoot him, in the Vatican, as he walks up a winding staircase. The cardinal is seen plummeting over the side and falling down onto the worm's eye camera in the gallery below. Again - operatic, yes. Metaphorical fiction, sure. Characters as types even more than characters - yes. A Godfather I and II, not really. The play is the almost comical (yes, that's right) who gets 'hit' first, almost Shakespearian black comedy, as Ma Corleone goes for the other Don, the other Don goes for Don Michael, maybe the Pope, and the other Corleones hit the hitters, and so on. It all happens simultaneously, as the bunch sit there watching the opera. You have the quick cut to the action happening elsewhere (which is a Godfather trademark technic, to be fair).I said two parts because the best part seems all these scenes when the family goes to Italy. I think it might have been much better if they'd gone easy on the old mob stuff, frankly, cut out much of the first part, and gone quicker to Italy, stayed with the story there longer, and developed the estrangment and reconciling of father and son - which brought the cast to Italy, to the opera. That part not only isn't developed, it's pretty much not even present - which is a little startling. The final revenge is just sort of dashed off, even after a private confession with the man soon to become Pope. That's just forgotten. That's hard to believe. It might have benefitted from a little of the emoting of the Don's final scream as dear Mary is accidentally shot by the goofy but dangerous assassin, rather than just a calm - hey, let's get revenge.Of course, such a suggested movie would be even more of a departure from Godfather I and II than this film was. But it seems that's the direction 'Francis' wanted to go, but didn't have the guts, perhaps, to go all the way. As for his daughter in the role, she obv. had trouble with the acting. But it wasn't that bad. As for Keaton, she just didn't seem all there, like she was just reading her lines. As for Shire, I thought she was good - same for Garcia. I thought the cameo by now SF Mayor Willie Brown was appropriate, trying to line up crooked judges. As for Pacino, himself, I kept flashing on Dick Tracy given his delivery of some of those lines. But again . . hey. As for a comparison with the contemporaneous Goodfellas, this film shows more the uselessness of gangsterism than the off and on glorification found in Scorsese's somewhat less than epic film. The best scene in this regard might be the final scene. Long shot of the 90ish (?) near death husk of the great Don Michael, who 'never wanted to be Don', sitting next to a dilapidated Italian villa on a folding chair or something, reading the paper, just going limp and falling off the chair - dead. End of story, cut to credits. That's it. That's what his life amounted to. Regrets and remorse of his daughter's murder filling his thoughts. Maybe even a life never really even lived.

I have heard so much negative things about this film and most from people who haven't even watched it! I never read the book nor do I know the director. I watch the film and saw NO brainwashing as people stated was in the movie. To some up the movie, it is Independence Day meets Planet of the Ape.

This, apparently, I'm sad to say, is it.But one word comes to mind when describing this movie ass. Pure, cinematic, ass.

It's hard to keep a straight face when the movie does things like that to you.I read other people's comments about this movie and I almost wonder if I actually watched the same thing. This movie was _horrible_. Not even Ishtar or Waterworld horrible - more along the lines of Manos, the Hands of Fate, get me out of the goddamn theater, I'd rather watch paint dry, horrible.I could _almost_ forgive the acting. Woo isn't known for that. People don't typically see his movies for the acting. But they do see them for the action. Not surprisingly, here, too, this movie fails miserably. Watching Yun-Fat mow through small armies of baddies as they explode into gratuituous mists of ketchup was fun for the first, oh, seven minutes. Wait, not even. Maybe four. Then it's all downhill from there as you realize that what I have just described will occur ad nauseum for the next 110 minutes with not much variation. Somewhere in there Woo spins a yarn about a blind pianist and a hitman with a conscience (\/that's\/ never been done before), but, to be honest, I fell asleep around the 70 minute mark and never did find out what happened with that part of the story. Trust me, the impressions I got up to that point tell me that it wouldn't have been very important anyways.Rather, this film is concerned pretty much entirely with gunbattles. Gunbattle after gunbattle. After gunbattle. After gunbattle. And so on. Hey, I like a good gunfight as much as the next guy. But they are not exceptionally well choreographed - the least of which I would have expected from Woo.

Here fix yourself a piece of french toast. Crispy, golden brown, maybe a little on the bland side, but perfectly good all by itself. Now let's add some melted butter. Okay, that's a little better. Now add some maple syrup. Pretty good, huh? Now add some powdered sugar. Now spoon on some honey. Now ladle on some strawberries. Now add some peanut butter. Now dump some chocolate syrup on it. Now--- WAAAAAAAAAAAAAIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIT!Get the picture? The first mistake Dino made was trying to make this all things to all people, which it ain't. Either going the serious route OR strictly camp would've made it a much better film than it actually turned out to be, but by trying to go in two different directions at once, the end result was the most schizoid kind of film imaginable, where they threw everything at the screen to see what would stick, and ended up with mostly a runny mess instead.Another colossal blunder? The production design may have originally been conceived by the excellent Ferdinando Scarfiotti (CAT PEOPLE), but whatever his influence was is now completely drowned by the wacked-out visions of Danilo Donati, who is still stuck in the same time warp back when he designed BARBARELLA for Dino as well.As for the performances? Max Von Sydow, Brian Blessed, Peter Wyngarde, John Hallam and Topol seemed to be the only ones to get that this wasn't Shakespeare, and had as much fun with Lorenzo Semple Jr.'s WAAAY-overdone material as Mike Hodges allowed them to. Sam Jones and Melody Anderson were BLONDELY, blissfully oblivious to what was going on around them, and the international contingent of Ornella Muti and Mariangela Melato were naturally, purely camp just for being there! On the other hand, poor Timothy Dalton tries to put on a game face yet again in a situation that finds him playing the straight man in inherently gay or at least uber-camp surroundings.Ultimately, the score by Queen gets the mood just right even when the visuals don't, and Howard Blake's underscoring echoes the serial sensibility. Now with a better, surer-handed script and more charismatic leads, this could've transcended its legacy as a paragon of cinematic ineptitude and become one of the better comic strip knockoffs, ala BATMAN (the Tim Burton version.)As a time capsule of what one could expect from the debauched and decadent '80's, it's still a hoot worth watching at least once.

I must reiterate, however, to drive home the point DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE.  Or, if you must, buy a ticket for an actually worthy movie and theater hop, don't reward the people who put out this wretched abomination with your money.  I was a fortunate one, one of my friends paid for the ticket, not me.  And if he thinks he's ever getting his money from me, he's got another thing coming.  However, I will never get back the precious, wasted hours of my life.  Save yourselves!  At many points, I must wonder whether the script was in fact the fault of Hubbard or a five-year old child.  One or the other thought that it would be really cool to have a bunch of stone-using tribesmen zoom around in Harriers. But wait, not only are the tribesmen able to restore thousand-year-old fighters, fuel and arm them in a magical military base that still has power after those thousand years, they can also talk to each other without any headsets or other radio equipment while flying around!  Psychic tribesmen!  Who, after that thousand years, know phrases like, Piece of cake and, I'm on his tail.But even if the screenplay was written by this hypothetical child, Hubbard is still responsible for the hero, Johnny Goodboy.  Who the hell names a character Johnny Goodboy?  And why does he have no personality at all?  I mean, none!  He strives to emulate Braveheart with little, failed attempts at rousing speeches, but they come across as flat and pathetic as the rest of the acting.  The Psyclos aren't nearly as intimidating as they should be, just how much can the audience fear an ultimate enemy that you could defeat with an egg in a jar with an opening too small to fit their fist through? On top of that, they still manage to trust the Terl guy despite the fact that he goes out of his way to screw over everyone he passes by.  You could easily cause a Psyclo to have a seizure just by asking, No means yes and yes means no, do you want me to hit you?In any event, if you think that a galvanic skin tester can cure your spiritual ills and that giving $400,000 to become an Operant Theta VIII is a good idea, then run to see this movie!  If you are not yet in the clutches of Hubbard's happy family, then avoid it at all costs.  I'm convinced it's a Scientology plot to numb the brains of the viewers so much that their warped technobabble makes sense in comparison.
