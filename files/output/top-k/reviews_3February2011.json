[{"date":"3 February 2011","score":"","review":" Adapted from the book by John Irving, this coming of age film is set in the early 1940's. America was still recovering from the Great Depression when we became involved WWII. Men were off at war while women entered the workforce to replace those men. The Cider House Rules occurs in two settings St. Clouds and the orphanage and an apple orchard in the small farming town of Cape Kenneth. At the orphanage, people visit to either adopt a child or receive an illegal abortion. Michael Caine, as Dr. Larch, runs the orphanage. Tobey Maguire plays Dr. Larch's protégé, Homer Wells. Dr. Larch, having raised Homer, wishes Homer to replace him as head of the orphanage. Homer, desiring to spread his wings and find his place in the world, leaves the orphanage to find his own dreams. Homer and Dr. Larch have one major area in which they disagree the right for women to obtain an abortion. Throughout the film, as Homer engages in a love affair with a Candy Kendall (played by Charlize Theron) whose boyfriend is off at war, Homer and Dr. Larch continue this disagreement via the postal service. Eventually, Homer must confront his beliefs when he is faced with a young lady who is pregnant by her father. Homer's heart grows three sizes that day, and once Dr. Larch has passed, he returns to the orphanage to fulfill the role Dr. Larch always wanted him to fill.Unlike other coming of age films like The Graduate, the navel gazing Homer does is more about society and individual rights rather than deciding trivial things (in comparison) such as what career or personal relationship to pursue. Similar to The Graduate, the film uses the vehicle of a love story to unfold the plot of a young man's search for self. As Homer becomes involved with Candy, he experiences the irony of having a sexual relationship and not worrying about consequences. While Homer does not impregnate Candy, he still faces a difficult pregnancy decision in the form of Rose Rose (played by Erykah Badu). Rose is impregnated by her father and (obviously) does not wish to have the baby. Her father will not let her leave, she cannot take care of a baby, and she considers taking care of it herself. Homer, having seen the horrific results of botched abortions, makes the decision to help Rose and performs the abortion himself. It is at this point that Homer realizes that the world is imperfect and if women insist on abortion they should be able to receive them safely.The film was shot on location and therefore uses natural sources when possible. Additionally, the film stock and filters used give the scenes a softness that hearkens back to simpler times and life in the country. This softness also helps detract from the harshness of the abortion debate running throughout the film. The lighting and filters softens everything just enough to allow the viewer to sit back and enjoy the film without becoming too uncomfortable watching abortions occur and allowing the viewer to relax and discover how Homer's search for meaning unfolds.
